Alan Levin's call to Save Dr. Shaikh in Mukto-mona</b></font>
</p>
<p>A Call To Arms!<br>
<br>
Things are moving fast in the campaign for the liberation of Dr. Shaikh,
sentenced to death in Pakistan for blasphemy, after a defective, and partly
in-camera trial where the judge was constantly intimidated by a mob of violent
fundamentalist clergy.
</p>
<p>
( <a href="http://www.iheu.org/Shaikh/sentence.html">http://www.iheu.org/Shaikh/sentence.html</a>
).<br>
<br>
Two appeals have been filed on Dr. Shaikh's behalf, one by the family and
another by Human Rights activists. Now an inmate of the terrible death cell, Dr.
Shaikh is not even allowed to carry a pen with him, and those who do not belong
to his immediate family cannot visit him anymore, officially. Thankfully, Abid
Hasan Manto, Pakistan's well- known and respected civil libertarian lawyer will
argue Dr. Shaikh's case without charging any fees. `It is my duty to defend Dr.
Shaikh', he said.
<br>
<br>
A team of dedicated Human Rights activists are working hard to provide support
for Dr. Shaikh in Pakistan, risking themselves in the process. The influential
`Friday Times' of Islamabad has carried an extensive report on the case. On the
IHEU's website you will find statements from liberal Pakistani Muslims
protesting the sentence. The campaign in Pakistan too has started. Our
colleagues in Pakistan need help and support, and this can only be done by
intensifying our efforts internationally. There are hundreds who are victims of
these laws and we need to help.<br>
<br>
Have you written to your senator? Did you contact your Prime Minister? Will you
remind them of the urgency of the matter? If your organisation has Honorary
Associates or a well known President, will you ask them to issue a statement
asking for the liberation of Dr. Shaikh and the repeal of Blasphemy laws in
Pakistan (which victimise all religious minorities, specially Christians and
Ahmadiyas), as well as in other countries?<br>
<br>
A sample of the press notices, statements and editorial comments from well known
personalities can be found on the IHEU website at <a href="http://www.iheu.org/Shaikh">www.iheu.org/Shaikh</a>&nbsp;
Respected and influential newspapers like the New York Times, The Daily
Telegraph UK, The Guardian, The Times UK, Norwegian Dagbladet, BBC, CNN, The
Age, Melbourne, The Ottawa Citizen, The Times Higher Education, the San
Francisco Chronicle, Newspapers in Peru and elsewhere, the mainstream Muslim
media, as well as smaller newspapers in various parts of the world have reported
on Dr. Shaikh's case and about IHEU's campaign. Human Rights organisations
world-wide are rallying together to defend Dr. Shaikh and to protest Pakistan's
barbaric blasphemy laws. Nobel laureate Sir Harry Kroto and famous personalities
like Richard Dawkins, Claire Rayner, Terry Prachet have issued a statement. The
Centre for Islam in Europe (Belgium) and the Islamic Human Rights Commission too
(UK) have condemned the death sentence. IHEU's President Levi Fragell's
communication to Kofi Annan, UN's Secretary General has been handed over
personally; diplomatic parleys have been initiated by IHEU's representatives
with various governments, some details of which are on the IHEU website. A
meeting of diplomats from the EU countries has been held in Islamabad. Efforts
are on now for a group of diplomats to visit Dr. Shaikh in prison. The French
Freethinkers have called on Members of the French legislature to take up the
matter seriously. Mr. Pannella, an Italian Member of European Parliament has
asked urgent questions of the European Commission as to action being taken by
the European Commission.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The campaign has kicked off! But we need to take it further, and we need your
help.
<br>
<br>
Protest demonstrations are being organised all over the world: for reports and
photos of events held in Birmingham UK, in Jallandhar, India and Oslo, Norway,
please check the website. A big demonstration is being planned in London on 10
September in front of the Pakistan High Commission. For details, send an e mail
to <a href="mailto:London@iheu.org">London@iheu.org</a> Please tell others.
Bring your friends: specially if they are liberal Muslims (or from the Pakistani
community) who are willing to speak. `The Today' programme is expected to
discuss the event on the day. The Humanist Centre in Central London has set up a
big display on Dr. Shaikh and the blapshemy conviction: it is expected to
attract widepsread attention. More demonstrations are being planned: in
Khatmandu and in Washington; in Los Angeles and in Ottawa; in New Delhi and in
Paris. Can you help? Will you join us? Do you know who might join? Can you
forward this e mail to other Human Rights groups and ask them to join? Please
let us know. Always copy your communications to <a href="mailto:campaign@iheu.org">campaign@iheu.org</a>&nbsp;
which is the central coordination point for the international campaign.
<br>
<br>
If there is no Pakistan High Commission or Consulate in your city, there may be
an aid agency which supports the Pakistan government which could be the venue of
your peaceful demonstration. It can also be in front of your country's foreign
ministry demanding action from your government to urgently intervene. Or you
could organise a press conference expressing your disgust at the judgement and
your solidarity with Dr. Shaikh.
<br>
<br>
Hundreds of letters are pouring in at the IHEU office about Dr. Shaikh's case,
but have you signed the on-line Petition at <a href="http://www.iheu.org/Shaikh/petition/index.html"><b>http://www.iheu.org/Shaikh/petition/index.html</b></a>&nbsp;
which will be used to lobby governments and diplomats? Please do so. On the
website it is possible to register to receive regular updates via the
International Humanist News. Please do sign up to receive this crucial campaign
tool.
<br>
<br>
On the IHEU website a Special Section RESOURCES FOR CAMPAIGNERS with<br>
information and special materials for campaign work has been<br>
developed. DRAMATIC PICTURES of Dr. Shaikh before his sentence can be<br>
found at <a href="http://www.iheu.org/Shaikh/pic15724.jpg">http://www.iheu.org/Shaikh/pic15724.jpg</a>

Dr. Shaikh helped the poor and disadvantaged in his country when he could. Now
it is our turn to come to his defence! Please let us not fail him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Can we do it? Yes, It has happened in the past that people have been allowed to
leave their countries following an international outcry and diplomatic
intervention.<br>
<br>
Let us therefore intensify the campaign, and also help humanise the Blasphemy
law in Pakistan!<br>
