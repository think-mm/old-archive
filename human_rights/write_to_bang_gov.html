<p>Dear Friends:</p>
<p>The names of many victims have been published in a book along with dozens of
photographs but the Bangladesh government banned its distribution outside. No
one can carry these reports abroad. A few persons that tried to take them out of
the country have been arrested at the airport and are now being charged with
sedition. I am attaching only four photographs herewith for your quick glance.</p>
<p>Every day, on average 10/12 people are being murdered in Bangladesh--- it
exceeded that of occupied Palestine where daily death rate (both groups) is 3
for the last 18 months. But unfortunately, as the international news media is
not covering the 'crime against humanity' in Bangladesh, the newly elected
pro-fundamentalist government of Begum Khaleda Zia let loose a reign of terror,
looting and murders. There is still no end in sight!!!</p>

<p>Within the last three weeks, a number of young girls have been gang raped
that includes Fahima (10), Mahima (15), Selina (14), Sabrina (15), and Bilkis
(28). Except Bilkis, a housewife, the rest of them committed suicide to save
their families from dishonor. Most pathetic is that, after the gang rape of
Mahima by three of the ruling party activists namely Sumon, Nasir and Halim [Halim
is a teacher of a Madrassa], they circulated the photographs of the 'rape' and
the rape victim within the locality giving the names and address to defame the
honor of her parents and family as they belong to the secularist 'opposition'
party, the Awami League. She committed suicide. What a mentality!!!</p>
<p>It is ill luck for Khaleda Zia that in 1991 on her victory many Bangladeshi
girls namely Nurjahan (18) of Maulvibazar, Firoza (14) of Sathkira, Nurjahan2
(15) of Faridpur, Aleya (16) of Dinajpur and another 70 were murdered in the
pretext of Shariah Law by corrupt and ill educated 'kat' Mullas of Bangladesh.
Such murders stopped when protests were sent from all over the globe.</p>

<p>Political revenge and atrocity is crippling the Bangladesh economy. The
government has arrested a few intellectuals and scholars for writing against
atrocities. Nearly 112 journalists have been beaten up/ arrested for exposing
the issue and the ruling party hoodlums destroyed 12 press offices and last
year, a total of 12 journalists were murdered for reporting crime. As her
Minister for Information and Media Control, Dr. Abdul Moyeen Khan did not ban
publishing 'undesirable newspapers' as perceived by the government, he has been
replaced with a hard liner. Earlier, the Zia government cut off electricity,
sewerage and telephone lines of a newspaper [The Jonokanto] and stop giving
government advertisements as it continued publishing gruesome pictures and
stories of atrocities, rape, looting, murders, takeovers and terrorism. However,
in spite of threat and intimidation, the major newspapers of Bangladesh are
still publishing stories of terrorism everyday.</p>

<p>This is for your information and please raise your voice to end atrocities
and political revenge in Bangladesh. Please write to Bangladesh PM, other
relevant personalities and law makers.</p>
<p>People voted the new government into power for two of its promises: first,
'to eliminate terrorism and establish rule of law', and second, to 'end
corruption'. Unfortunately, both are increasing fast ...beyond tolerable limits
and it appears, the new government has completely forgotten its promise.
Instead, it is politicalizing even the 'law and order' issue.</p>
