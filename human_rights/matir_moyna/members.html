<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>We already know that&nbsp; Bangladeshi film 'Matir Moyna' by Tariq and 
Catherine Masud has earned a rare distinction and honor for the country from the 
international Cannes film festival. Matir Moyna was adjudged the best film out 
of 40 films shown in Director's fortnight and International Critics' Week. But 
it is very unfortunate for our country that the film is still banned by 
Bangladesh govt. Mukto-mona has taken an initiative to develop a site for &quot;Matir 
Moyna&quot; citing the details of the film and keeping all the articles/ protest sent 
by our members. <span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Those who haven't signed 
the petition, please go to the following site, read the petition and if you 
agree please sign the and then distribute this notice widely.</span></p>
