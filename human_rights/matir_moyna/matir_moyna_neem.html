        <p>PRESS RELEASE</p>
        <p>We are extremely delighted and proud to inform you that “Matir Moina”, 
        directed by Tareque Masud and produced by Catherine Masud, has been 
        awarded the International Critics' Prize at Cannes 2002. The Prize is 
        given every year for the best film from each of the three main sections 
        of the festival by FIPRESCI, an international association of film 
        critics and journalists. The 11-member jury was comprised of members 
        from 11 countries around the world, including Britain, Canada, Russia, 
        Sweden, Australia, and Egypt among others. The other two awarded films 
        are “Divine Intervention” by Elia Sulaiman of Palestine and “Heremakono” 
        by Abdur Rahman Sissako of Mauritania. This is the first time that all 
        three prizes have been awarded to the films of three predominantly 
        Muslim countries.</p>
        <p>According to the citation mentioned on the award, “Matir Moina” was 
        awarded for “the authenticity and moving sensitivity with which it 
        portrayed a country’s struggle for its democratic rights.” The award was 
        handed over to Tareque Masud by Jury Chairman Ronald Bergan of Britain 
        during the formal ceremony held on Saturday evening, May 25th. The film 
        was selected from over 40 films included in the Directors’ Fortnight and 
        International Critics’ Week sections of the festival.</p>
        <p>It may be mentioned here that the film was earlier disqualified from 
        the Camera d’Or competition for first feature on the grounds that the 
        director had previously made a documentary longer than 60 minutes in 
        duration. This newly introduced rule considers long documentaries as 
        feature films.</p>
