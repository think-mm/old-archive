  Matir Moina or The Clay Bird, a film by Tareque Masud, wins critics heart with 
  the International Critics' Prize<br>
  </font><font color="#800000">By Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, London<br>

  <p><tt><font face="Arial">This charming, gentle film, showing in the 
  Director's Fortnight at Cannes, is one of the real finds of the festival. It 
  is about the experience of childhood, but draws upon unexpected reserves of 
  drama and emotional disquiet to shed light on the world of adults, too. Set in 
  East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the late 1960s, writer-director Tareque 
  Masud's film tells the story of Anu, a boy whose father, Kazi, has abandoned 
  the sophisticated European-British ways of his own youth to immerse himself in 
  Islam.</font></tt></p>
  <p><tt><font face="Arial">Kazi rejects westernised medicine to treat his 
  ailing young daughter, and is perpetually furious at his wife's brother, an 
  easy-going left-ish intellectual, for introducing Anu to sensuous Hindu folk 
  rituals. So Anu is sent unhappily away to a strict Muslim education.</font></tt></p>
  <p><tt><font face="Arial">Here Masud contrives some wonderful scenes of Anu's 
  lonely, vulnerable childhood - appalling yet fascinating to anyone who has 
  ever been to boarding school anywhere in the world. The director demonstrates 
  a sure and compassionate touch in showing Anu making friends with Rokon, 
  another outcast, and devising his own melancholy fantasy games. Later, when 
  Anu suffers from an infection of the inner ear, which gives him tinnitus-type 
  noises in his head, he is immersed under water in front of the entire school 
  in an exorcism ceremony.<br>
  <br>
  Set against these shrewdly evoked scenes of private drama are some wonderful 
  crowd scenes and ambitious set pieces, centring largely on the Hindu festivals 
  of which Kazi is so suspicious. Masud also positions personal upheaval 
  alongside the gathering political storm: a family tragedy dawns as the 
  Pakistani army begins to invade, and Anu's family flee for the jungle.</font></tt></p>
  <p><tt><font face="Arial">This is a tale told with humour, visual flair and a 
  canny sense of narrative. Masud shows real feeling for both the children's 
  sadness and their ingenuous pluck in the face of life's trials: a combination 
  symbolised by the clay bird of the title, yearning to escape its earthly form 
  and take wing.</font></tt></p>
