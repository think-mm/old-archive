  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">From
  the government quarter it is being widely publicized that for political
  revenge and greed of property some local miscreants committed persecution on a
  few members of the minority community. Had it been true then only well to do
  minority families, big merchants of the cities and known business
  establishments would have been targets of repression. But real picture does
  not corroborate this claim; the minorities, rich or poor, irrespective of
  their social status were persecuted. <u>This is also a characteristic feature
  of current minority repression</u>. It demands an analytic explanation why so
  many helpless people were persecuted.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Repressed
  people of minority community spoke out many a times- this is also apparent in
  the published news and reports of field survey and in their witnesses before
  the Public Inquiry Commission, that the main cause of persecution on them lies
  in the fact that main political opponent(s) of Awami League alleges that
  ‘they vote en masse in favour of boat symbol.’ This is their ‘greatest
  offence’. In most of cases victims of repression could identify the
  terrorists and even the so-called godfathers working from behind. But they
  were afraid to disclose their names and identities for fear of further
  repression. The Commission thinks citation of a few examples of events would
  not be out of context. &nbsp;<o:p>

  ‘<span style="color:maroon">A College girl raped in presence of her mother
  at Bhanga</span>’: “A minority family of a village Avinagar within Bhanga
  upazila (Faridpur) became a victim of barbaric torture for offence of casting
  votes in favour boat-symbol. Supporters of BNP and its fundamentalist partners
  did not stop even after ransacking their houses and looting valuable
  properties; the miscreants celebrated the night with nefarious exultation
  &amp; drinking, and after being stripped off her cloths the gangsters started
  raping the girl en masse in the very presence of the mother. ..... As the
  mother begged them with all humility to save her daughter’s ijjat (chastity)
  she was brutally beaten. They continued their barbaric operation till 1a.m.
  and then dragged the girl to a nearby place and gang raped her again. Finally
  she was left<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in front of
  their ransacked house early in the morning with severe injury. </span><span lang="EN-US">The

  housewives. Both were raped after their husbands were held back on gunpoint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US">Two brothers of Das family
  did not leave their village home even after seeing barbaric repressions taking
  place around them. Who would harm them ? But they did realize their flaws in
  their assessment only when the family was attacked on Thursday night. In the
  dead night a group of terrorists led by a cadre of 4-party alliance attacked
  the house of Das family. The cadre informing Das brothers that they took
  possesion of the house through a document asked them why didn’t they vacate
  the house yet. ‘Why they have cast vote in favour of Boat ?’ Then they
  took two brothers outside their rooms in the face of firearms. They tied hands
  and legs of those two housewives with bedsteads and raped the girls in their
  respective rooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>..... Before
  leaving the house the terrorists threatened them that if they opened their
  mouths they would simply be killed.” (Janakantha, 15. 10. 03)&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US">3. <span style="color:maroon">Destruction
  of deity of goddess Durga</span>: During post election period in two villages
  named Hariakhali and Nirali within the Mollarhat sadar in the district of
  Gopalganj “BNP workers destroyed the Sharadiya Durga Puja altar and the
  deity Durga. A group of terrorists destructed Hindu deities in a temple
  located adjacent to house of one Amar Master in Chakulia village under Naldhi
  union. .... Deities of Radha Krishna were stolen after breaking in a temple of
  one Hindu gentleman Nirmal Paul. .... In Sadar Tularam Bazaar one small
  businessman Thakur Chandra is a disabled person with two legs invalid. He uses
  artificial legs. The terrorists took away his artificial legs for alleged
  offence of casting vote in favour of boat-symbol.” (Sangbad, 16. 10. 03)&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US">4. <span style="color:maroon">Threat
  to leave the country</span>: Mihir Kanti Majumdar of Mithanala village under
  Mirersarai police station in the district of Chittagong told the Public
  Inquiry Commission that on 5<sup>th</sup> November night 2001, 20-25
  terrorists made an assault on their house and severely beat his father on
  legs, hands, back and different parts of his body with a heavy iron rod. They
  also injured his mother on her hands and neck, and himself received several
  injuries at different parts of his body caused by the terrorists using a
  falchion and Chinese axe. They kept on saying that if they did not accept
  Islam within 10 days they ‘<span style="color:maroon">have to leave the
  country</span>’. He indicated to the Commission that the attackers belonged
  to BNP.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Experiences
  of those people visited the affected localities reflect identical views. Most
  of the persecuted persons expressed their opinion that terrorists supporting
  4-party alliance persecuted them n the assumption that they voted in favour of
  boat-symbol. As an example, we may cite the experience of visiting Ramshil by
  Mr. Rashed Khan Menon, one of the leaders of 11-party alliance.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">“<span style="color:maroon">...
  But Ramshil once again exposed the rightist communal faces of victorious BNP
  and his 4-party friends in the last election. Whoever visited Ramshil got
  identical experience. The terrorists of victorious BNP committed torture on
  them, looted their abodes, violated modesty of their women.</span>”</span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">The identity of the persecutors in
  many cases was revealed even in the national press media. As a specimen such a
  news item is quoted here from a leading national daily ‘Proton Alo’ dated
  05. 10. 01 :&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">“
  Narayanganj : A barbaric attack on minorities took place at Panchabati under
  Fatullah police station. This attack was conducted under the leadership of
  Nura and Eunus, known as BNP terrorists in the locality- informed the local
  people.”&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">So there is
  no ambiguity in the political identity of the persecutors,-- most of them were
  violent supporters of 4-party alliance of affected areas or from neighbouring
  localities and active political workers, and some were professional musclemen
  who always worked for whichever political party came to power.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US">Most of the persecutors came
  from local families of low-income group and young in age (15-30), less
  educated, and most of them unemployed. However some terrorists had good
  background coming from well to do families. This is in brief social identity
  of the persecutors committing repression on minorities.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">A
  big question before the Commission was to find what was the real goal of the
  persecutors ? Was it just an instantaneous reaction of victory-jubilation –
  with which usually associated were vengeance, looting, unbound sexual
  pleasure- those usually were found following victory of a mediaeval war as
  natural corollaries ? Or was there any far reaching objective, and in order to
  achieve this objective repression-dishonour, threat to leave the country etc
  were carried out ?</span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">It is not possible to provide a
  ready answer for the Public Inquiry Commission because of its manifold
  constraints. But after anlysing the available facts and information one
  discovers a pattern of repressive events, which was followed meticulously by
  the terrorists throughout the country. The pattern is somewhat like: -&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:

  </span></span><span lang="EN-US">In the minority inhabited zones an
  environment of extreme terrorism must be created so that minority-voters did
  not dare to go to polling booths, and felt insecure to live in their abodes.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:

  </span></span><span lang="EN-US">To achieve the goal some repressive ways and
  measures had to be adopted such as – threat to life, destruction of houses
  and business establishments followed by lootings, ruthless physical torture,
  various kinds of sexual harassments including raping on their women, and
  finally a severe threat for leaving the country for good.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:

  </span></span><span lang="EN-US">And this was the final goal of the entire
  project i.e. eviction of the minority population from the country. It is
  extremely difficult on the part of the Commission to say whether the plan was
  made at the highest political level or at the local level. As it appears the
  operation had two objectives :&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:

  </span>If (i) a sure sense of feeling could be implanted in the mind of
  minority community that they were unwanted and exterior, (b) their faith on
  the state of Bangladesh could be eliminated from their minds, and (c) sense of
  belonging- that they were also an integrated element could be destroyed from
  their minds, then if not today, they were sure to leave the country tomorrow.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:
l39 level1 lfo62;tab-stops:list 36.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>If minority families could be evicted to India, then properties left
  behind might be taken possession off with little or no price at all. As for
  example before the election normal price of one Kani of cultivable land in
  Annada Prasad village in the district of Bhola was tk 70-80 thousand which
  came down to meager tk 25-30 thousand during post election days. However
  willing migrants were not 100% sure if they would get that price even.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US">So, the repressors and
  repression-planners had immediate objective(s) :&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">1. (a). ‘Grabbing of Property’-
  as it happened in the past, and</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(b). Transform the minorities to a ‘lifeless
  and impotent’ community so that members of the community become incapable of
  playing effective roles in any wide national activities starting from casting
  of vote. This means that presence of minorities must not make an influence or
  impression in our social life, political arena and state affairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US">2. The other object of the
  ‘repression-project’ was to make this country <u>depletion of minorities</u>
  through this procedure. That is to make Bangladesh a monometallic or
  monolithic theocratic state- wherein Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and other
  cultural-ethnic population will cease to exist in course of time. Just what
  happened in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and in case of different ethnic
  minorities in former Yugoslavia? As a result, following two goals, the
  planners expected, would be achieved :</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1" lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent3"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lust
  for grabbing personal property is a major cause. As for example we may cite
  the case of wealthy Hindu widow of sadar upazila Domar in the district of
  Nilfamari. A well organized and influential coterie was threatening her and
  raiding her house; for fear of life she with her marriageable daughter and a
  minor son was compelled to hide from one place to another. It was feared that
  the said powerful coterie might make a desperate attempt to grab her property
  by killing her minor son, only inheritor of her property. (Sangabad, 06. 11.

  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">It may be
  mentioned here that since 1947, it had been a practice on the part of a
  section of people to grab minority property whenever an opportunity came their
  way. But even then the Commission does not consider this i.e. grabbing of
  property as the chief cause for present crisis. If that had been the only
  prime objective i.e. instantaneous grabbing of property then persecutions
  would have been confined within rich-, businessmen- and wealthy professional
  families of minority community living in cities and business- and trading
  centres, and wealthy families of villages. And the poor and common families
  would have remained untouched. But in practice it did not happened so.
  Minorities were persecuted irrespective of their fiscal status- rich or poor
  only because they belonged to a particular religious community.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <u>Political Reason</u>:</font></b></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;Any
  mass-involved event occurring in our social life after being placed on a
  political background can be interpreted as a political issue. As for example
  the ‘Great Calcutta Riot’ of 1946 could be presented as an event decorated
  with political colour without much difficulty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Bangladesh
  government opined that whatever little repressions committed on minority
  community in one or two isolated cases were basically political- and not
  communal (as for example Mr. Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, an influential cabinet
  minister of Bangladesh government said in a statement, “<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">In only a few cases have we found instances of repression of minority
  Hindus.</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">”-</span>as quoted by
  BBC South Asia, 22<sup>nd</sup> November, 2001<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">). By making such assertions the government and leaders of the ruling
  parties wanted to make it clear that if a Hindu or a Adibashi were persecuted
  not because he was a Hindu or Adibashi but because he was a political worker
  (of Awami League). He became a victim of political vengeance. This apparently
  sweet sentence is engraved with clear mark of fraudulence. Had this hypothesis
  been true then a hundred years old grand gentleman Rajkumar Das, a totally non
  political man, of Annada Prasad village would not had suffered severe injury
  caused by merciless beating with solid iron rods.</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Or had this
  been true, then a helpless fleeing housewife Mitarani with a baby in her lap
  fleeing from a tortured village in north Bengal would not have ran through
  jungles to take shelter in India. [“We ran through jungles and over ditches
  the whole night and didn’t stop until we crossed the border”, said Mita,
  BBC News South Asia, 22<sup>nd</sup> November 2001]. If the said hypothesis
  were true, then thousands and thousands of common men belonging to minority
  communities fleeing from Gaurnadi, Agailjhara, Mollarhat, Chitalmari, would
  not have taken shelter at Ramshil. So there is no scope to treat events of
  minority repressions very lightly saying that those were consequences of
  political revenge committed by a handful of political workers.</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:SutonnyMJ">&nbsp;<o:p>

  Political Motive and Communalism<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">The current events relating to
  minority repression arose chiefly from political motives, - there is no doubt
  about it; with this are closely linked en masse grabbing of
  minority-properties, settling accounts of personal revenge etc. The Commission
  has already categorically stated that prime objective(s) of inflicting torture
  and persecution on minorities were (1) <span style="color:maroon">to bar the
  minority voters coming to poling booths</span> so that these voters could not
  cast votes in large number in favour of a particular political party, and (2) <span style="color:maroon">to
  make the country depletion of minorities</span>. This attitude could be termed
  as <span style="color:maroon">politically motivated.</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">The obvious question we face now to
  what extent this is interlinked with communalism. In fact there is no scope to
  separate these two elements from each other in case of minorities. The
  political motive and communal feeling- these two factors got intermingled. By
  the term Communalism or Communal mentality we are made to understand– a
  ‘mentality’ from which a desire springs out to deprive a specific
  religious community (or an individual within the community) its due rights or
  to cause mental or physical torture on the community (or an individual within
  the community) because the community professes a different faith.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">In reality, the Commission opined-
  this mentality of the persecutors was very much responsible and active behind
  such a large-scale events of minority repressions, especially indiscriminate
  persecution carried on common and poor members of minority communities.
  Because, opponent political parties of Awami League, especially 4-party
  alliance consider minority voters as ‘vote bank’ of Awami League, so in
  any election-time a repression befalls on minority voters. This is a general
  feeling of a typical minority member, observes the Commission. They are
  persecuted because they are Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists; and they are
  asked to leave the country simply because they belong to minority communities.
  The Commission further observed that although a large number of people
  belonging to majority community voted for Awami League (40-41%) common Muslim
  voters were not persecuted en masse or so severely, neither a pledge was made
  to make the country devoid of AL voters by driving out these Muslim voters en
  masse from the country. So one must identify Communalism as a major factor
  behind current large-scale minority repression.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Another
  issue that came before the Commission was to considered how the repressed
  people feel about the whole phenomenon- their mental condition, general
  feelings and thoughts, hopes and aspiration, how they look themselves at the
  problem, and what kind of solution they think off. In this regard Commission
  has following to say :&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">One can

  as if a silent, unconscious, lifeless-matter-like creatures bearing human

  perplexed, and lost power of thinking. They have some how managed to express
  stories of their mortification and answer queries of the journalists and
  members of survey teams of different organizations, that too very reluctantly.
  Let us cite a few examples.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">1. A
  housewife named Prabharani (40) wife of Paresh Chandra Mistry, of village
  Lejpata within Daulatkhan upazila in the district of Bhola expressed her
  heart-ache story with tears in her eyes- “We are people of this country. How
  long will we live in our own land as foreigners ? ..... Bearing such
  heart-ache pain we do not wish to live any more. We can’t express our
  feelings to anyone, nor could we show our pain to any one. Only Iswar (God)
  knows how are we? ..... How long we shall have to continue such life ? ...
  Please tell Madam Khaleda Zia about feelings. ..... We do not do any politics,
  don’t go to poling booths, - nor shall we go in future. Please tell her to
  look at us with little sympathy and compassion. .... Let her do some thing for
  our safety, ... we want a little peace.” (Prothom Alo, 23. 10. 01)&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">2. Paresh
  Chandra, husband of Prabharani expressed his feeling of anguish in the
  following manner: “Our helplessness dwindled to a lowest level. After
  looting our properties from our house the beasts in human form raped my wife,
  daughter, and daughter in law in my very presence. My wife was hiding herself
  in a pond adjacent to the house with her nose a little up the water level; she
  was dragged in from there. My daughter in law was hiding in a garden of
  betel-nut trees behind the house with her six month old female child. On
  hearing the cry of the child the beasts ran there, and gang raped her and my
  college going daughter then and there. I could not utter a single ward. They
  were standing with a Ramdao (a big chopper) on my neck. Even if they didn’t
  hold the chopper I could have done very little. I had nothing to do, nor do I
  have now- if I protest or raise my voice we would have to leave our abodes of
  fore fathers. ..... We don’t find any one standing on our side with
  courage.”</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
