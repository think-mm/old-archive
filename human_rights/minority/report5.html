  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">One can
  very well imagine the mental state of those physically tortured, incapable to
  resist, deprived of administrative protection, helpless week people. They were
  as if a silent, unconscious, lifeless-matter-like creatures bearing human
  names. After this crisis they became devoid of consciousness &amp; utterly
  perplexed, and lost power of thinking. They have some how managed to express
  stories of their mortification and answer queries of the journalists and
  members of survey teams of different organizations, that too very reluctantly.
  Let us cite a few examples.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">1. <span style="color:maroon">A
  housewife named Prabharani </span>(40) wife of Paresh Chandra Mistry, of
  village Lejpata within Daulatkhan upazila in the district of Bhola expressed
  her heart-ache story with tears in her eyes- “We are people of this country.
  How long will we live in our own land as foreigners ? ..... Bearing such
  heart-ache pain we do not wish to live any more. We can’t express our
  feelings to anyone, nor could we show our pain to any one. Only Iswar (God)
  knows how are we? ..... How long we shall have to continue such life ? ...
  Please tell Madam Khaleda Zia about our feelings. ..... We do not do any
  politics, don’t go to poling booths, - nor shall we go in future. Please
  tell her to look at us with little sympathy and compassion. .... Let her do
  some thing for our safety, ... we want a little peace.” (Prothom Alo, 23.
  10. 01)&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">2. <span style="color:maroon">Paresh
  Chandra, husband of Prabharani</span> expressed his feeling of anguish in the
  following manner: “Our helplessness dwindled to a lowest level. After
  looting our properties from our house the beasts in human form raped my wife,
  daughter, and daughter in law in my very presence. My wife was hiding herself
  in a pond adjacent to the house with her nose a little up the water level; she
  was dragged in from there. My daughter in law was hiding in a garden of
  betel-nut trees behind the house with her six month old female child. On
  hearing the cry of the child the beasts ran there, and gang raped her and my
  college going daughter then and there. I could not utter a single ward. They
  were standing with a Ramdao (a big chopper) on my neck. Even if they didn’t
  hold the chopper I could have done very little. I had nothing to do, nor do I
  have now- if I protest or raise my voice we would have to leave our abodes of
  forefathers. ..... We don’t find any one standing on our side with
  courage.”&nbsp;<o:p>

  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The article
  has caught my sight and feeling. I share his pain and sorrow exactly the same
  way he has been feeling being a Muslim American after the incident of
  September 11, as being a Bangladeshi Hindu I have been feeling it since the
  October 1 election. I really find hard to believe that this is the country
  where I was born! This is the country where I grew up! This is my dearest
  motherland! Feeling like an alien in own land is much more painful than what

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">...
  I can assure Dr. Ahmed what he has been facing in America is far less worse
  than what we have been experiencing here on our own soil. ... the average
  Americans are not as irrational and inhuman as the people here to start
  ransacking your houses, killing your friends, raping your daughters/sisters,
  ousting you out of their land. ... Moreover, the government is there to stand
  by you to protect your right. In contrast, here in Bangladesh administration
  is turning a blind eye as if nothing has happened or is happening!</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">...
  How will I be able to trust and depend on my friends and colleagues and
  acquaintances any more who I was coming along so long and suddenly find them
  surprisingly silent over my suffering and harassment! Dr Ahmed, you are
  fortunate enough than I am, because there are people in America who are urging
  not to equate Islam with terrorism and not to be vindictive to Muslims in
  general. Here even for this piece of writing I could be a target of violence
  act!</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">...
  history reminds me that nothing goes unchallenged. Minorities here also have
  the limit of patience! If the minorities are forced to feel totally insecure,
  then they will naturally adopt steps for self-protection like other minorities
  in the region. When that happens, the majority will become the bigger loser.
  We must all work together to avoid that from happening.’ (Daily Star

  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">2. The minority community feels
  that Civil administration or for that matter state’s entire security system
  (including Police, Answar, BDR &amp; Army) failed to provide them with
  adequate protection during difficult days. In one ward their faith on the
  state system of Bangladesh has almost evaporated away. The following questions
  when they asked, “Is this my country ? Why haven’t we any rights here? Why
  can’t the state provide us with appropriate safety system.” expose lack of
  faith of the minorities in the power elite of Bangladesh and above all over
  the state of Bangladesh.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">3. A large section of the minority
  community feels that they have been denied of their due rights from all walks
  of life from state to society- as for example, their rightful and adequate
  presence in government and non-government administration, security system-
  from police to army, and over all social activities is not felt significantly.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">The conscious section of the

  unequivocally stated of equal rights of all citizens :</span></p>

  The burning feeling of the minorities is that sine 1947 following partition of
  India the state and a powerful section of the society have been behaving with
  the minority community in such a manner that a sense of feeling has been
  created in the mind of the community that this country does not belong to
  them. And through this mental agony children of the community are being
  brought up from one generation to another. A sense of inferiority complex has
  developed in their mind and behaviour. Because of such influence the minority
  community is gradually transforming itself into an entity incapable of
  resisting, and anti-reactive population. The natural instinct of a human being
  ‘to resist’ is now extinct from their mind; they are turning into a
  lifeless and unexcited mass-entity.</span></p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">5. Another mental agony the
  minorities, especially Hindus, suffer from is that they are to absorb slanting
  remark and doubt of their loyalty to this country. They hear very often such
  disgraceful utterances coming from a common man to a highly placed official at
  the state level. What pain and frustration such remarks create in
  minority-mind is not appreciated by the remark-makers; their mind becomes
  bitter against the sate itself.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">6. Another inner feeling of pain of
  minority-mind is that not only the government, even common citizens fail to
  appreciate their real condition. A common remark they often listen in streets,
  in working places: “Brothers, you are being looked after in this country
  with so much care and affection usually meted to a son in law.” Such
  utterance is a clear indication that this country does not belong to minority
  community as house of a father in law rightfully does not belong to a son in
  law.</span></p>

  Hopes and aspiration of a common man belonging to the minority community is
  quite identical with those of a common man of the majority community; their
  need and wants are very small &amp; simple. A common minority citizen wants to
  live in his own land with peace and safety, a secured life with his
  mother-wife-daughter-daughter in law, he wants to educate his son &amp;
  daughters according to his ability.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">(b).
  The repressed minorities clearly stated that they don’t want to participate
  in voting- they want their names to be struck off from voter-list in all
  future election. The state system that cannot ensure of security and safe
  casting of votes, or cannot protect from persecution of minorities following
  election atrocities in such state system inclusion of their names in
  voter-list is just a mockery so far they are concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

  view?&nbsp;</span></font></span></b><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">After
  critically examining the statements of the witnesses appearing before the
  commission and talking to a cross-section of leading members of the community,
  the Commission got the impression that according to them a solution might be
  found if following steps were taken.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">(a). The
  problem is very complex indeed. It is intermingled with psychological
  complexity of the minority and unconcerned mentality of the majority
  community. Right from a common man to an educated one belonging to the
  majority community-all have to understand the sentiments and problems of the
  minority communities with a feeling of co-sufferer and sympathy. They have to
  realize – why a Hindu gentleman feels uneasy to wear <i>dhoti</i> (a
  loincloth for men), why a minority housewife is hesitant to put on s<i>indur</i>
  (vermilion) on her <i>sinthi</i> (line of parted hair near forehead) or wear <i>shankha</i>
  (conch-bangles) on her hand, or why a minority child is afraid of identifying
  himself as Hindu ?</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">(b). The
  state must ensure complete security &amp; safety of the minority community,
  and materialize their rights provided in country’s constitution. The
  administration at all level must be neutral and effective.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3"><span lang="EN-US">(c). The state and the society in
  general, must take adequate and effective series of measures so that an
  atmosphere of tolerance and secularism, and concept of pluralism could be
  created. To achieve this goal necessary amendments are to be incorporated in
  the constitution, and all discriminatory laws must be abolished.</span>
