  </u></font>
  <p align="justify">During post election days, while incidents of violence
  directed against a particular community were appearing in daily news papers
  and other media, the care take government of justice Latifur Rahman and the
  subsequent elected government played the issue very lightly. Their reaction
  was unconcerned and very cool.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <b>
  <p align="justify">2.1 Government Reaction</p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">After analysis in details of the events concerning minority
  repression it appeared to the Commission as if there were no government in the
  country during first ten days in the month of October, 2001. These days they
  were celebrating their achievements of successful completion of a neutral,
  peaceful and free election with overwhelming joy. On the occasion of their
  imminent departure they were not at all concerned with such little things like
  'worsening law and order situation' or so called 'minority repression'. For
  this reason local police and civil administration were aloof; the
  administration did not feel encouraged to come forward to stop atrocities
  leading to large-scale minority repression. As a result the terrorists felt
  encouraged.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The situation did not show any sign of improvement even
  after assumption of power by Khaleda Zia led government of 4-party alliance.
  Rather minority-repression continued to increase day by day. Unfortunately
  even the new government seemed to treat the matter very lightly; it was stated
  that most of the reports published were exaggerated, although there might be
  one or two stray cases here and there. And causes behind those incidents were
  (i) political motivation, (ii) personal grudge &amp; revenge and or (iii) lust
  for grabbing property. (See Daily Star 16. 10. 01, Jugantor 16. 10. 01, Sngbad
  17. 10. 01, Bhorer Kagoj 16. 10. 01, and Bangladesh Observer 16. 10. 01)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Even though the government termed those incidents of
  minority repression as conspiracy, it ordered all district commissioners to
  report back within 48 hours on alleged minority repressions that took place
  since October 2, 2001 in their respective districts (Ittefaq 14. 10. 01).
  Nothing has been heard of those reports of district commissioners since then.
  The government then on 8<sup>th</sup> November, 2001 formed a high powered
  4-member committee of high level bureaucrats to scrutinize and verify the
  reports of minority repression appearing in news media. This was a closed
  committee. Even if the said committee had submitted any report to the
  government, contents of the report have not been made public even today. No
  programme regarding visit of the committee to affected areas, or interviewing
  victims of repression was publicly announced.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Commission opines that there might be some emotion on the
  part of the reporters or interviewers in describing the incidents related to
  minority-repression, and there might be some variation in quantitative
  description in the reports, but those factors do not negate real truths.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">A matter came up before the Commission for consideration
  was -- <u>what class of people</u> became more victims of these terrible
  repressions. After critical reviewing and analyzing the events Commission
  concluded that although men of upper social strata were also not spared, <font color="#7f0000">mostly
  common men were the victims of these terrible and wide spread repressions and
  torture</font>. The Public Inquiry Commission observes as follows:</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">During pre-election period although terrorists and
  miscreants made activists of political opponents as their main targets of
  political malice, but in case of minorities they made no such distinction. Who
  were common voters and who were political leaders or political workers did not
  matter to them. And repression came down on members of minority community
  irrespective of whether they were leaders, workers or just common innocent
  men. There was only one objective: to make the so called minority vote bank of
  a particular political party ineffective by showing threat and fear, and
  continuing persecution on minorities. As the election-activity reaching its
  peak, common voters of the minority community were becoming main target of
  political violence. Not only the Hindu minorities, but gradually Christians
  and Adibashis were also becoming targets of political persecution.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">After the election the intensity, dimension, extension and
  kind of repression on those targets increased manifold. What was limited to
  some restricted areas spread all over Bangladesh following the election.
  Another noticeable matter was that among the minority community common men of
  no means and wealth became the victims of terrorism en masse. Therefore, it is
  not difficult to understand that grabbing of properties and wealth and
  occupation of business establishments were not the only objective of directed
  minority repression. If that were true then wealthy families of villages and <i>ganjs</i>
  (small business centres), and big business men and known business
  establishments would have been targets of repression. But in reality that did
  not happen; the fact was members of the minority community were persecuted
  irrespective of being rich or poor or of their social status. <u>This is also
  one of the characteristics of current minority repressions</u>. In the current
  episode why such an enormous number of helpless common people were affected
  demands an analytical explanation.<b></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">After careful study of those reports made available to the
  Commission it became apparent to the Commission that a vast number of minority
  population had to take shelter elsewhere after being evicted from affected
  areas. After scrutinizing reports appearing in daily news papers it is found
  that (i) nearly four thousand minority families were evicted from their abodes
  and (ii) thousands of people were forced to take shelter elsewhere leaving
  their own villages. There might be difference of opinion as regards its exact
  numbers. Besides, during post election period a large number of common
  minority families were forced to take shelter in India. Calcutta's leading
  English daily 'The Statesman' (19. 11. 01) published a report covering
  minority repression taking place in Bangladesh and large number of refugees
  from Bangladesh taking shelter in India; some interviews of evacuees have also
  been published.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Anxious expatriates from Bangladesh raised voice of protest
  in different foreign countries. As for example, some Bangladeshi expatriates
  observed a token hunger strike on 09. 11. 01 in front of 'House of Commons' in
  London and then submitted a memorandum to the British Prime Minister. In
  Switzerland a memorandum was submitted to the UN Secretary General through the
  UNO office on 06. 11. 01. Besides, memorandums from Bangladeshis living in
  different foreign countries were sent to Prime Minister of Bangladesh. On 19<sup>th</sup>
  November a protest demonstration was made in front of Bangladesh embassy in
  Paris. On individual level also many memorandum, letters etc. were sent to UN
  Human Rights High Commissioner. In this connection we may quote comments made
  by Mary Robinson, UN Human Rights High Commissioner to a correspondent of 'Daily
  Star' on 12<sup>th</sup> November, 2001 in Delhi:</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&quot;<i>Yes it is extremely important some of the NGOs
  raised with me the issue of recent violence against minorities in Bangladesh.
  I see that the government of Bangladesh has established a high powered
  committee to examine the situation. Had the Bangladesh have a permanent
  National Human Rights Commission they can accumulate a lot of information and
  knowledge of the situation and ways to ensure that issue such as violence or
  discrimination against minorities, violence against women and children can be
  tackled and addressed. </i>(Daily Star, 29. 11. 01)</p>
  <b><u><font face="SutonnyMJ" size="4"></font></u>
  <p align="justify">2.2 Difference of this year's repression from earlier ones.</p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">From the reports available to the Commission and from other
  evidences it appeared to the Commission that there are some distinctive
  features that make current minority repression different from those of earlier
  events. The nature and extension of present minority repression are of
  different dimension from repressions took place earlier. It may be mentioned
  here that since 1947 terrible violences directed against minority community in
  the name of communal riots were committed by a section of people belonging to
  majority community - an one sided affairs. And in these acts of violence state
  had always provided encouragement sometimes openly and sometimes indirectly.
  As a result as days and years passed on, the helplessness implanted in the
  minds of the minority community became deeper and deeper.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">At the time of emergence of Bangladesh although communal
  force retreated for the time being, but some communal violence took place in
  some localities of Bagerhat-Khulna belt even as early as 1972- and in some
  other parts of the country Shradiyay Puja Mandap (roofed terrace where Hindu's
  greatest festival <i>worshiping of Autumnal Goddess Durga</i> usually takes
  place) and deities of goddess Durga were destroyed, and sanctity of the Puja
  (worship) was molested. All these events gave sufficient indications that the
  evil force did not die. During post '75 period after the religion base Islamic
  political parties were granted legality some communal events were taking place
  though appearing as sporadic and isolated which made it clear that communal
  forces were gathering momentum. From then on attempts were made to identify
  the minority community as a community obedient to India serving Indian
  interest. Their patriotism and their loyalty to the country were thrown to
  open question. This very attitude made the members of the community victims of
  discrimination in service as well as in the fields of business and other
  professions.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">After the destruction of Babri Mosque in India in 1992,
  various kinds of atrocities such as wide spread communal repression, looting
  of properties, raping and molestation of women, threat, eviction from own
  abodes and land and social persecution took place at different localities of
  different districts of Bangladesh against the minority community, especially
  against the Hindu religious community. This was the first time minorities were
  categorically told that this is a Muslim dominated country and existence and
  status of the minority community exclusively depend on the pleasure of the
  majority community.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The post October election-repression on minorities was a
  very successful staging of great drama of the 1992 rehearsal throughout the
  country. From incidents cited enclosed in the report and from the witnesses of
  the affected persons appearing before the Public Inquiry Commission it became
  clear to the Commission that principal target of the terrorists was Awami
  League, but in most cases the Kharga (a large falchion used for immolating
  beasts) of persecution fell on helpless, weak and opportunity-starved minority
  community. Because they were minorities and at the same time they were
  supporters (alleged) of Awami League. They were guilty on these two counts. As
  they were incapable of resisting, the first and major strike befell on the
  common people belonging to minority community.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <u>
  <p align="justify">Characteristics of current Minority-Repression</p>
  <p align="justify"></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    </u>
    <p align="justify">The controlling force of the ideals, programme of action
    and organizational structure- that were active covertly behind the
    minority-repression has main objective (i) to create communalism as a
    political tool, and by consolidating this communal force (ii) to increase
    influence of religion based politics in Bangladesh, which would act as
    helping hand of that controlling force. The political parties of the country
    although were aware of this fact they did not raise their voice of protest
    or tried to build resistance against this evil design.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">The publicity media, general public and the conscientious
    section of the civil society heavily criticized the role of government
    administration in meeting effectively the evil force responsible for
    tortures on minorities or stopping minority repression. There are evidences
    in support of such allegations in the reports of different organizations
    available to the commission and witnesses. It is noticed that as the
    perpetrators were locals the victims could recognize their full identities
    in most cases. Even then it is found in the reports prepared after three
    months of occurrence of incidents number of arrests are meager and most of
    the alleged culprits were found to move around with pride and no fear in
    their respective localities. Under this perspective it is natural to assume
    that administration was aloof to apply laws against perpetrators, perhaps
    being influenced by outside force. And as in days of Pakistani Government
    the administration remained silent and in some cases their hostile behaviour
    towards the victims encouraged the terrorists. This has never been seen
    since Bangladesh became independent.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">After analyzing the events the Commission came to the
  conclusion that distinctive difference of current repression against
  minorities from those happened in the past lies in its wide spread extension
  and in intensity of atrocity. Repression took place against minorities
  irrespective of their social status. Poor, rich and even professionals
  belonging to minority community - none were exempted. From this, one may
  reasonably assume that such wide spread violence directed against a particular
  section of our own population could not have taken place without preplanning;
  it just could not happen in a sporadic fashion.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The Public Inquiry Commission opines that there were
  far-reaching objective and goal behind all these preplanned violence. They are</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">(a). to cut off the 'minority community', an advanced
      component of the population from the main stream of our population by
      eliminating distinctive features of Bengali history-culture-tradition-
      being nourished from ages such as 'concepts of pluralism' prevailing in
      Bengali social system, the characteristics of Bengali culture''Unity in
      Diversity&quot; etc;</p>
      <p align="justify">(b). to establish a '<u>monolithic social system</u>'
      and convert Bangladesh into a '<u>religion based theocratic state</u>'.</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">These goal and objective are definite deviation from
  history of constitution of sate of &quot;People's Republic of Bangladesh" from
  the beginning to end, our struggle for independence and our ideals of
  liberation war.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <u><font size="4">
  <p align="justify">3. Recommendations</p>
  </font></u>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">In 1971 after fighting a liberation war against state of 'Islamic
  Republic of Pakistan' victorious people of Bangladesh established a state of
  their own 'People's Republic of Bangladesh'. And through the adoption of 1972
  constitution for the country a legal basis and princples were established how
  to run the state affairs. We noticed that 4 fundamental principles of state
  policy incorporated in the constitution of 1972 reflected insights of many
  complex ideas and concepts cherished by our people- <i>Pluralism</i>, <i>historical
  coexistence of peoples following variant religions and sects</i>, <i>traditional
  stream of development of our pluralistic society</i>, <i>economic status of
  our people</i> etc.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The Commission firmly believes that the original '72-constitution
  has been amended (already mentioned before) in such a way that orientation of 'People's
  Republic of Bangladesh' has been tilted, and because of its influence and
  impact a repression oriented society has been created in Bangladesh. If
  Bangladesh were to return to its social equilibrium the foremost need is to
  reinsert 4 fundamental principles of state policy of the original constitution
  (1972) ' in the Constitution, all state affairs, social system, and work
  culture of the administration.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The Commission therefore from its own perceived truths
  present following recommendations before the government and the people.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">Bangladesh is a multi-religious and more than one
      ethnic-elements based state. Because of this reality, <i>secularism is the
      criterion of people's development and happiness</i>. The government must
      commit itself to this faith, and its moral stand must be made known to the
      public. The government must uphold very clearly the cause and effect of
      this basic concept to the people and take effective steps in this regard.
      In all systems of conducting state business including, administration,
      security system, education system etc. basic principles of state policy of
      the constitution, 'secularism and principle of equal rights' must be
      reflected and materialized. In regard to appointment in government and
      non-government services, the existing discrepancy must be removed in all
      branches of state organs particularly civil administration and in all
      branches of disciplined force including Ansars, Police, BDR, and Army; and
      the objective must be made clear by gradually appointing suitable
      candidates from the minority community with increasing rate.</p>
      <p align="justify">The amendments that were brought in the constitution
      from communal viewpoint in contradiction of fundamental rights must be
      repealed. The government must restore constitution back to its original

      localities in Sylhet, Garo inhabited areas in greater Mymensingh and in
