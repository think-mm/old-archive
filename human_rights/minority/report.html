  State “People’s Republic of Bangladesh” emerged in 1971 as an
  independent sovereign republic in the world map following a bloody war against
  the Pakistani occupation force. According provision of Bangladesh constitution
  (Articles 72/2-3, 119/1b) adopted in 1972 after every 5-years (or earlier if
  for any reason the parliament is dissolved) there will be a general election
  on the basis of adult franchise to elect a National Parliament (<i>Jatiya
  Sangsad</i>). Accordingly, the 8<sup>th</sup> general election was held on 1<sup>st</sup>
  October, 2001. The Bangladesh National Party (BNP) led 4-party alliance (other
  electorate partners : Jamaat I Islami, Jatiya Party-Naziur group, and Islami
  Oikya Jote) emerged victorious with three-fourth majority in the parliament
  after obtaining 220 seats out of 300. Awami League after gaining 62 seats
  emerged as main opposition party. (See Appendix 1, page 39)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt"><span lang="EN-US">Although
  according to opinions of some local and foreign election monitoring
  organizations, the election was held in a relatively peaceful and normal
  atmosphere, the Awami League rejected the result bringing in allegations of
  large-scale malpractices and a large section of voters belonging to minority
  communities were barred from casting their votes.</span></p>

  may be mentioned that in the last 7<sup>th</sup> parliamentary general
  election (June, 1996) the Awami League after obtaining largest votes (37.44%)
  formed the government under the leadership of Shaikh Hasina in cooperation
  with Jatiya Party led by General Ershad and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal led by ASM
  Abdur Rob. (See Appendix 2, page 39). The election was held in a free and fair
  atmosphere first time under a constitutional caretaker government. The Awami
  League Government completed its full 5-year term and handed over the power to
  care taker government on 15<sup>th</sup> July, 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

  Parliamentary election) the BNP formed the government with the help of Jamaat

  political unrest and crisis the government led by Begum Khaleda Zia resigned
  before the completion of her tenure. Following a general election held without
  participation of major political parties held in February, 1996 BNP formed a
  government that passed in a hurry a bill for care taker government. Under mass
  movement the government step down and a caretaker government came into power
  under the leadership of retired chief justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

  alliance won in three-fourth seats. It became apparent that government would
  be formed under the leadership of the BNP, the strongest party of the alliance
  and a single party with absolute majority. During the days before the newly
  elected government took over (2 – 11<sup>th</sup> October) reports of
  minority repression such as ‘forcible occupation of lands and houses of
  religious minorities, setting fires on houses, looting, and hair-raising
  events relating to raping of women from children to middle aged, married,
  widow or virgin’ were the news of everyday in the columns of all national
  dailies and other media. Repression of such ugly nature directed against a
  weaker section of the population created deep anxiety and fear among the
  people. Side by side reports of setting of fire on houses, of physical
  torture, even of killing etc. of workers and supporters of defeated Awami
  League found prominent places in news papers’ columns. In brief, a picture
  of total anarchism surfaced through the newspaper-media. A new government was
  constituted on 11<sup>th</sup> October, 2001.</span></p>

  looting, setting of fire, etc as depicted in the news media clearly indicated
  that the care taker government was in effect powerless. Taking advantage of
  the situation terrorists, miscreants and supporters of recently victorious

  government would take stern actions to eliminate terrorism and against the
  terrorists irrespective of their political affiliation. Unfortunately even
  after the formation of the government and PM’s stern assurance no good news
  of improvement of condition were reported in news papers. On the contrary, new
  and fresh news of atrocities and repression done by the supporters of the
  4-party alliance were published in the press-media. Pictures of various kinds
  of repression on weaker section population of the society appeared in the
  press. It was noted that police as well civil administration failed to help

  </span>The existing uneasy situation prevailing in the country, imperilment of
  people, inertness-insensitiveness-idleness on the part of the politicians,
  anxiety and disrespect to weakness of the administration on the part of the
  common mass etc. prompted the conscious citizens and the civil society to take
  some initiatives. Some respectable intellectuals-educationists, cultural
  personalities, and a few social organizations toured different places of
  affected areas to see for themselves the real situation. After seeing
  incidence of repression and visiting post-election situation in different
  places they found that the events appearing in news media had factual basis.</span></p>
