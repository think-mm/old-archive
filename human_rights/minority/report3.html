  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:windowtext">From
  the facts presented above and summary of reports presented in the appendix,
  one gets a clear idea how religious and ethnic minorities, especially Hindu
  religious communities, had been tortured, persecuted and oppressed for four
  months from September to December 2001. On the contrary Government described
  most of reported stories of minority repression as excessively colored. &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:windowtext">The
  Government-stand became quite clear from speeches and utterances made by
  different ministers time to time. Regarding minority-repression the interior
  minister Mr. Altaf Hosen Choudhury’s contention was- ‘</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:blue">press
  reports about attacks on the religious minorities' - (are) ‘<u>baseless,
  exaggerated and politically motivated</u></span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="color:windowtext">’.
  In addition to that he depicted those events of tortures and persecutions on
  minorities as ‘</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:blue">arranged show</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:windowtext">’.
  His utterances in this regard are quoted here : ‘</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:blue">In fact, it is entirely a staged
  drama, a preplanned game. A certain (political) party is sponsoring terrorism
  to undermine the BNP and create people's mistrust about the ruling party. ....
  We smell political motive (in such occurrences). Money is being spent on
  terrorists and, in cases, the BNP people are also being used</span></i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:windowtext">.</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="color:windowtext">’

  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2"><span lang="EN-US">The government has classified
  the events into three categories. As for example the interior minister has put
  the attacks on minorities in three classes : some are conspiratorial, some are
  based on rumors, and some are partially true. The last class has two kinds-
  personal jealousy and political. (See Editorial, Sangbad 17. 10. 03)</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color:windowtext">&nbsp;<o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:18.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:windowtext">The
  Commission opines that the news published in dailies, especially reports sent
  by local (mofussill) correspondents and reporters have factual basis. All
  those reports could not be rejected just depicting as exaggerated; or there is
  no scope to treat those reported incidents lightly. On the contrary the
  Commission opines that the courage shown by the mofussil (local) journalists,
  and by publicly bringing out factual news of minority repression and torture
  to the nation they set examples of sincere and honest journalism are very
  praiseworthy. Along with this, the Commission also praises honest roles of
  those field workers of different humanist organizations who collected and
  still collecting data on tortures and persecutions visiting many affected
  areas in an attempt to unfold truth and fact. It would be inappropriate to
  throw away their collected facts and information or calling those as being
  spoilt by exaggeration. &nbsp;<o:p>

  their social status not politically based- none of them are directly involved

  Many of those parties are very much opposed to Awami League, some are even
  closer to BNP than AL from ideological standpoint. But most of these parties
  brought in allegations of wide spread minority repression throughout the
  country following general election in October 2001. The 10 intellectuals we
  mentioned above are politically neutral and none of them belongs to any
  political party. Under this backdrop the statement(s) issued by Interior

  of the state. The responsibility of the state and duty of the government in
  charge running the state are to protect constitutional rights of people of all
  communities. But in effect it is seen that a section of the population for
  reason of being belonging to particular religion(s) has been persecuted and
  became victims of torture during the post election period. The state has
  failed to provide safety to a particular section of the population, and the
  government cannot shrug off its responsibility for the failure. By clouding
  the truth with a sugarcoated statement like ‘We are all Bangladeshi’ one
  might derive pleasure of self-satisfaction, but by making such statement one
  cannot make truth a lie. To the Commission such statements coming from the

      the local society witnessed these extremely ugly barbarities like helpless
      and detached spectators. The Commission came across such a spectator in
      Lord Hardinge union under Lalmohan upazila. In a survey work conducted by
      Ain o Salish Kendra and a team of investigation of the Civil Committee in
      those localities, feelings of a local school head master, a Muslim
      inhabitant of the nearby locality was recorded. In this locality Annada
      Prasad is one of the most affected village. He experienced dreadful night
      of violence and atrocious activities taking place at ‘Vendor Bari’
      residence complex in Annada Prasad village. He felt very sad, and knowing
      fully well these were shameful incidents he did not take any initiative to

      celebration. Indifferent attitudes of local public representatives in the
      affected areas were apparent almost everywhere. Leaders of most political
      parties were found wanting to organize preventive measure to counteract
      evil beastly forces. Even the small parties except issuing statements or
      visiting some isolated affected localities failed to stand by the side of
