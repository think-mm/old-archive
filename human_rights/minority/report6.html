  <p align="justify">Before the partition of Bengal in 1947, the zone
  constituting of districts within Rajshahi and Dhaka divisions of the undivided
  Bengali speaking province Bangladesh or Bengal Presidency was commonly
  referred to as 'East Bengal'. The said East Bengal with slight modifications
  was included in Pakistan as its eastern province following the partition of
  India in 1947. On the basis of a often-quoted statement of Jinnah many learned
  persons thought that the partition of Indian sub-continent in 1947 although
  made on the basis religion based two nation theory, Jinnah in fact wanted that
  constitutional basis of future Pakistan would be secular, i.e. in future
  Pakistan-Constitution equal rights of citizens irrespective of their caste
  creed and religion would be ensured. The gist of the speech of Mohammad Ali
  Jinnah delivered at the Constituent Assembly as the first governor general of
  the country may be cited:</p>
  <font face="SutonnyMJ">
  <p align="justify">Ò<i>... </i></font><i>you are free to go to your temples,
  you are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worships in this
  state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed- that has
  nothing to do with the fundamental principles that we are all citizen and
  equal citizen of our state. In course of time Hindus will cease to be Hindus
  and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because
  that is the personal faith of each individual, but in political sense as
  citizens of the state.</i>&quot;</p>
  <p align="justify">The future events however did not bear any resemblance with
  Jinnah's quoted speech. The secular principle of Jinnah was not accepted by
  the fundamental principle makers of Pakistan. Within six months of Jinnah's
  demise, Pakistani Prime minister Liaqat Ali Khan declared in the same
  constituent assembly that <u>Pakistan would be a Muslim state</u>. The gist of
  1952-report of 'Basic Principles Committee' constituted under the leadership
  of Liaqat Ali Khan was that Pakistan would be a Muslim state and its future <u>constitution
  would be framed on the basis of Principles of Islam</u>.</p>

    Discrimination of Minorities: Legacy of Pakistan</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <dir>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">The adoption of constitution of Pakistan in 1956 was the
  result of continuity of that thought enunciated in basic report of 1952. The
  constitution made the country an Islamic state with formal name '<i>Islamic
  Republic of Pakistan</i>'. East Bengal was christened as 'East Pakistan'.
  Declaration of 1956-constitution made Pakistani-minorities second-class
  citizens. Along with this constitutional measure, other legal provisions were
  also adopted to squeeze rights of minority community. Notables among those
  were Property acquisition act, Requisition of Property Act 1948 through which
  the state 'for its own need could acquire any property of any citizen', East
  Bengal Evacuees Act 1951- the object of which was to look after and protect
  left out properties of the evacuees. After 15<sup>th</sup> August, 1947 any
  person, normally a permanent resident of East Bengal, who had left East Bengal
  out of fear or for reason of communal riots, would be identified as 'evacuee'.
  Whatever might be the motive these acts because of ill uses of those act
  minorities were persecuted and harassed. So, since creation of Pakistan
  continuous efforts were made to create an environment in the country so that
  minorities could not stay here.</p>
  <p align="justify">The Country emerged as an independent sovereign state-
  &quot;People's Republic of Bangladesh&quot; through war of liberation on 16<sup>th</sup>
  December, 1971. Partition of '47 took place on the basis of Jinnah's
  two-nation theory. On the other hand Mujibnagar government and freedom
  fighters fighting a bloody war established People's Republic of Bangladesh
  rejecting religion based two-nation theory.</p>
  <p align="justify">It was reasonably assumed that spirit of liberation war and
  adoption of '72-secular constitution for People's Republic of Bangladesh had
  buried communalism and minority-problem once for all. But soon it proved
  wrong, especially post-seventy five events reestablished communal force in the
  soil of Bangladesh with renewed strength. This evil force gradually gained
  strength. The minority-problem with its evidently multidimensional character
  emerged as a national problem.</p>
  <p align="justify">The partition of forty-seven identified non-muslim
  population namely Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, so called Adibashis and other
  small ethnic population of the then East Pakistan as 'Minority'. As a result
  of partition of Bengal a large and conscious section of Hindu population of
  East Pakistan was forced to leave the country because of different
  psychological reasons and communal riots of '46 and '47. Simultaneously this
  is also true that the then central government of Pakistan and East Pakistani
  Muslim league government did not take any effective measures to prevent Hindus
  leaving East Bengal en masse or tried to restore confidence of minority
  communities. On the contrary they did precisely opposite.</p>
  <b>
  <p align="justify"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">1.2 Sources of
  discrimination</span></p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">The discriminatory behavior towards minority community that
  started during Pakistani days never stopped, rather it increased manifold with
  time. In 1971 it took an extreme violent repressive form at the hands of the
  barbarous Pakistanis and their local followers resulting over 10 millions
  frightened &amp; panic-stricken people crossed over to India for safe shelter.
  It had rarely happened in history such a mass-migration. After Bangladesh
  became independent all most all of those refugees taking shelter in India
  during our liberation war returned home. But problems that the returnees faced
  as regards their rehabilitation never have been studied with facts and
  features. (Many of them did not get back properties they left behind or sold
  at very cheep price.)</p>
  <p align="justify">Since partition of Indian sub-continent, the minority
  community had been victim of social and state repression, and discrimination
  has been continuing even after establishment of independent Bangladesh some
  times in rigor and some times in slow space. Among social repressions
  include-- occasional communal riots, forcible occupation or attempts to occupy
  minority property by powerful coterie. Many means and techniques were used in
  this attempt. The primary ones were- taking advantage of discriminatory acts,
  such as Enemy Property Act or later known as Vested Property Act; different
  violent methods such as expedition of open occupation of property equipped
  with arms and ammunition, deployment of gangsters and hooligans, threat to
  forcibly evacuate houses or migrate to India, various kinds of continuous
  threats-- from killings to violation of modesty of women.</p>
  <p align="justify">This is now an established fact that members of the
  minority community, especially Hindus, are continuously migrating although no
  government(s) had acknowledged it in the past or acknowledging it now. But
  there is no government explanation why Hindu population is diminishing at a
  significant rate. There are several causes behind migration of which communal
  riot is of course a big one. Following riot of 1950 Hindus had migrated to
  India in large number. Next during and after '64-riot lakhs of minorities
  migrated to West Bengal. In one survey conducted in a village adjacent to
  Dhaka it is observed that 80% of Hindu population of that village left for
  India after '64-riot. (Ref: Helal Uddin Khan Arefin, Shimulia: '<i>Bangladesher
  paribartanshil krishi kathamo</i>'[Shimuliya: Changing agriculture-structure
  of Bangladesh], Samaj Nirikshan Kendra, Dhaka University, 1994)</p>
  <p align="justify">Next, as a fall out of Babri Masjid-episode in India
  persecution of minorities in Bangladesh that took place in1990 and '92
  resulted again a large number of minorities taking shelter in India most of
  whom did not or could not return. On top of it following 8<sup>th</sup>
  amendment in the constitution intensity of minority repression increased
  during the year 1988-89. (For details we refer to '<i>Some facts on Communal
  Repression and Persecution</i>', Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity
  Council, June 1989). The relevant amended article of the constitution 2A
  states now, 'The <u>state religion of the Republic is Islam</u>, but other
  religions may be practiced in peace and harmony in the Republic'.</p>
  <p align="justify">The problem of minority repression in Bangladesh is
  gradually drawing international attention. Mr. Abdel Fattah Amor, Special
  Reporter of the Commission on Human Rights for Religious Intolerance came to
  Bangladesh on 20<sup>th</sup> May, 2000 for few days to see for him the state
  of affairs. He could identify basic causes of different kinds of repressions
  directed against the minority community. From his report it is seen that he
  not only drew the attention of the government but expressed anxiety to the
  following burning problems relating to minorities, namely, Vested Property Act
  and inheritance laws, Attacks on Hindu- and Christian Communities and forcible
  occupation of their properties, Attacks on Ahmedia Community, Discrimination
  in employment in Government-non government establishments, Creation of
  obstacles and hindrance against minorities to participate in politics
  freely.... etc. (See '<i>UN Documents on Elimination of All forms of Religious
  Intolerance</i>', A/55/280/Add)</p>

    <p align="justify"><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">1.3
    Demographic decline</span></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <dir>
    <p align="justify">There are no available government documents regarding
    migration of minority population, especially to India. Even there are no
    factual and informative analyses on this issue done by sociologists or
    demographers with honorable few exceptions. The entire matter was left
    unattended. But even in a naked eye the matter becomes obvious if one even
    casually goes through the census reports of different periods. It is noted
    that although Muslim population has been increasing with significant rate,
    the Hindu population on the other hand not to speak of increasing with
    comparable rate it is rather declining. There must be some reasons behind
    this decline of population of a particular religious group. The biggest
    cause pundits have identified is large-scale migration to foreign lands,
    more particularly to India.</p>
    <p align="justify">The less we say about non-human eviction of Tribal people
    and Adibashis from their traditional abodes the better. For reasons of
    following imprudent policies by the successive governments in
    post-Bangladesh periods, the population of Chittagong Hill tracts that was
    over 98% just immediately after partition of '47 now stands only 55%. That
    means in 1947 the ratio of Tribal population and non-tribal population in
    Chittagong Hill Tracts was 49:1 which now diminished to 11:9.</p>
    <p align="justify"><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">1.4 Government
    Policy: Legislative development and Constitutional amendments</span></b></p>
    <p align="justify">The discriminatory laws because of which Hindus are
    compelled to leave the country were, chiefs among those, '<i>Requisition of
    Property Act 1948</i>, <i>Evacuees Act 1949-57</i>, <i>Defense of Pakistan
    Ordinance, 1965</i>, <i>The EP Enemy Property Order, 1966</i>, <i>The Enemy
    Property Ordinance, 1969</i>, <i>The Enemy Property Ordinance (repeal) Act
    1974</i>,... and till then in vogue and is still active in amended form
    (2003), the infamous <font face="SutonnyMJ">Ô</font><i>Vested Property Act</i>.'</p>
    <p align="justify">Those discriminatory laws and post seventy-five
    constitutional amendments not only hurt the feelings of the minorities
    severely, their confidence on Bangladesh state machinery have been dwindled;
    they have been effectively transformed into second class citizens. As a
    result the minority community, a very much-advanced component of our
    population, is unable to contribute to country's national development work.</p>
    <p align="justify">It is needless to say that Vested Property Act is a law
    against the spirit of the constitution of Bangladesh. The act has violated
    the fundamental rights of a class of people guaranteed in the constitution :</p>
  </dir>
  <ul>
    <li>All citizens are equal before the law and are entitled to equal
      protection of law. (27)
    <li>The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of
      religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. (28/1)
    <li>No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place
      of birth, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any
      employment or office in the service of the Republic.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">Besides, the said act is also against the spirit of article
  11 of the constitution:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Republic shall be a democracy in which fundamental human rights and
      freedom and respect for the dignity and worth of the human person shall be
      guaranteed, ...</li>
  </ul>
  <dir>
    <p align="justify">To what extent this law could be discriminatory had been
    clearly pointed out once in1979 parliament by Mr. Rashed Khan Menon, MP. He
    remarked,</p>
    <p align="justify">'<i>In our country there is a law- its name is Vested
    Property Act or Enemy property act as is generally known to public.... It is
    a discriminatory law that is adverse to 27 and 28(1) articles of our
    constitution. Let me cite an example- if my brother dies today in Dubai, and
    if he has no other family members other than me I would inherit his
    property. But if my good friend Suranjit Sengupta's brother dies out side
    the country then his family would not inherit his property. His leftover
    property would go to the government hand..... Therefore, we have only one
    alternative before us, either the infamous act be abolished or articles 27
    and 28A be expunged from the constitution.</i>'</p>
    <p align="justify">There were no limits of misuse and misappropriation of
    Vested Property Act. The authority created complexities many a times by
    giving lease same property to different persons one at a time, whereas at
    the same time the real owner was found to roaming about in destitute on
    streets. We cite as an example a verdict of honorable court quoting from
    Dhaka Law Report.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">&quot;1. Custodians of enemy property treating a property
    as being a vested property without lawful basis for treating as vested
    property and leasing out the same to another is unauthorized and
    illegal.&quot;</i> (31 DLR (HD) 359)<i></p>
    </dir>
    <p align="justify">&quot;2. It appears from order sheet of vested property
    Miscellaneous case that even before the property in question was declared as
    vested property, the third party applied for lease and succeeded in
    obtaining a favorable report from local Tahsilder. Therefore, the property
    was declared as vested property by an order and it was apparent from the
    records that the Tahsilder and the interested party acted in collusion with
    each other in securing the impugned order and throwing the real owners out
    of their possession. It is our considered opinion, it would be just and
    proper to award exemplary cost against the Tahsilder and Sona Meah who are
    responsible for harassing a helpless widow and her son and depriving them of
    their lawful right to enjoy their own property. ..... &quot;</i> (31 DLR
    (HD) 343)</p>
  <dir>
    <p align="justify">For detail information how and to what extent Hindu
    religious minorities became victims of deprivation under the jurisdiction of
    so called enemy property act and vested property act we refer to an
    excellent work by Abul Barkat and his co-workers '<i>An Inquiry into Causes
    and Consequences of Deprivation of Hindu Minorities in Bangladesh through
    the Vested Property Act</i>', (Ed) Abul Barkat, PRIP Trust, 2000. Barkat and
    his colleagues identified the areas where and how through wrongful
    application of this act: (a) using terrorist methods, making forged
    documents, raising the issue of death or migration of a family the powerful
    persons grabbed minority properties; (b) The land-officials themselves
    grabbed minority properties; (c) alluring share-croppers and <i>bargadar</i>
    (a lessee of a piece of land under some set up terms and conditions)
    minority properties were grabbed by powerful groups.</p>
    <p align="justify">In the year 2000, with a view to how vested properties
    could be returned to real owners or their successors through legal methods,
    the then government in order to repeal the present vested property act
    constituted a 5-member Cabinet Committee under the leadership of the then
    law minister Abdul Matin Khasru. In consequence to this, a new bill 'Vested
    Property Return Bill 2001' was placed before the parliament on 29<sup>th</sup>
    March 2001, which was subsequently, passed on 8<sup>th</sup> April, 2001
    repealing the older act.</p>

    Bangladesh if due representation of the community in all organs of
    State-system i.e. 'empowerment of the minority community' at all level is
    ensured. But in the present setup of running state affairs practically there
    is no minority representation. The table given below gives the picture of
    minority representation in our law making legislative assembly i.e.
    Parliament (Jatiya Sansad) since 1970.</p>

  <p align="justify">* The big political parties nominate only a few candidates
  from among the minority community. During all these years minority leaders of
  great political personalities usually got elected. Their number is very small.
  Yet in pre independence East Pakistan during 1954 election (on the basis of
  separate election) as many as 72 members (23.3%) were elected in East Pakistan
  Legislative assembly of 309 members. In this election United Front won the
  lection with large majority thus eliminating Muslim League from the soil of
  East Bengal.</p>
  </font>
  <p align="justify">In government service the discrimination is more clearly
  evident. From the statistics provided by General C R Dutta, President of Hindu
  Buddhist Christian Unity Council a few years back-- it is learnt that (a)
  among the officials of state owned industrial establishments percentage of
  officials belonging to religious minority was only 1%, and labor-employees
  from this community was still less than 1%; (b) In total 5 banks including
  Bangladesh Bank out of 28 directors not a single director was appointed from
  minority community; (c) out of 80 thousand police there were only 2 thousand
  came from this community forming only 2.5%.</p>
  <p align="justify">From government statistics it is known that number of Hindu
  employees in non-military administration is 4,286 (9.6%); number of Buddhist
  and Christian employees are only 410 (0.65%) and 5(0.11%) respectively. No
  reliable information is available regarding employment position of minority
  community in Bangladesh army. (Ref: UN Document, A/55/280/Add2).</p>
  <p align="justify">If we leave aside the question of human rights for the time
  being, and we think of development of the country alone-- even then equal
  rights of minority community needs to be ensured. Because with the development
  process inseparably mixed up is the '<i>People's taste of freedom</i>'. The
  precondition of development of a country is elimination of all elements of
  captivity from the society. According to Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen
  these elements of social imprisonment are 'poverty as well as tyranny', 'poor
  economic opportunities' and with these must be included 'systematic social
  derivation', 'neglect of public facilities' and 'intolerance' or 'over-activity
  of repressive states'. (Ref:<i> Development as Freedom</i>, Amartya Sen,
  Alfred A Knopf Inc, New York, 1999). Sen had identified 5 'entities of freedom':
  <i>political freedom, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency
  guarantees and protective security</i>. The discriminatory special acts as
  only applicable to minority community, especially vested property act have
  robed all five elements of freedom in the case of minorities. Hence this
  infamous law is acting as an obstacle to participating members of the minority
  communities in country's social life, political fields and economic
  activities.</p>
  <p align="justify">If we judge the issue from this point of view, i.e. freedom
  is the necessary condition of development, then as a corollary we have to say
  that <i>essence of development lies in communal amity and social harmony</i>.
  And for social harmony we have to keep faith in the philosophy of '<i>Unity in
  Diversity</i>'. This means communal amity, and resuscitation and blooming of
  secular ideas in our social life and state affairs are fundamental
  pre-requisites for human development. Flourishing of communal amity and
  development of different communities of country's population depend on many
  factors interlinked with those 5 entities of freedom.</p>
