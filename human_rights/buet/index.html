  </p>
  <p>Dear Muktomonas,&nbsp;</p>
  <p>What is happening in BUET, one of our prestigious higher educational
  Institutions ? Some thing must be wrong with BUET education system. We must
  identify and rectify them. Why BUET education is leading us to retrograded
  views and narrowness instead of progressive looking attitude and liberalism ?
  These are the questions agitating my mind. Because the events in last few days
  indicate BUET administration has fallen into the hands of a wrong set of
  people.</p>
  <p>In the second part (II) I would send some photographs of police excess.<font color="#000080">&nbsp;(<b><a href="buet2.htm">Read

                closed only 28 days after it was reopened on August 11, ending
                an unscheduled vacation of two months.
                <p>BUET was closed on June 9 in the face of student unrest
                triggered by the killing of university student Sabequn Nahar
                Sony the day before.
                <p>All the residential students were asked to leave their halls
                by 5:00pm yesterday.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>Activists of the ruling BNP's student front, the Jatiyatabadi
                Chhatra Dal (JCD), also teamed up with police in the swoop on
                the agitating students and dispersed the students who tried to
                continue their sit-in on the BUET and DU campuses to drive home
                their seven-point demand, witnesses said.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>Withdrawal of punitive actions on some students, arrest of
                the killers of Sony and lifting of restriction on student
                politics are among the seven demands of the agitating students.
                A group of BUET students began a 'fast unto to death' on the
                campus on September 2 to force the authorities to meet the
                demands.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>Authorities' attempts to contain the fresh agitation led to
                yesterday's trouble. As police-student clashes continued, BUET
                Vice-chancellor Prof. Md. Alee Murtuza declared the university
                closed sine die at 1.30pm.

                <p>Reading out the order before journalists, Prof. Murtuza
                referred to an ultimatum given by some 20 student
                representatives during a siege laid before his office by the
                agitating students.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>He also claimed the agitators snapped power and telephone
                lines to the BUET administrative building and locked up all the
                gates of his office.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>In this circumstances, he added, the university has been
                closed to maintain law and order and protect life and property
                of its teachers, students and staff.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>In three hours of the closure, the students vacated all the
                eight residential halls including one for the female students
                with police making frequent announcements through loudspeakers.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>However, the violence that erupted at 11.30am continued even
                after the university was closed and the halls were vacated. The
                series of clashes came to an end when police drove the agitating
                students out of the BUET-DU area at around 7:00pm.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>Yesterday's trouble began at 11.30am when hundreds of
                students laid a siege in front of the VC's office, locked all
                the three gates of the office and served a one-hour ultimatum on
                the authorities to accept their demands.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>An hour later, police attacked the agitators. They charged
                batons and lobbed teargas canisters, injuring many of the
                protesters including some girls. A group of JCD activists then
                attacked the demonstrators who moved from the VC office to the
                cafeteria.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>However, the general students chased the JCD workers out of
                the area. Mokammel Hayat Muki, prime accused in the Sony murder
                case, was reportedly among the marauding JCD activists, while
                other accused killers of Sony led the attack on hunger- striking
                students.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>At around 12:30pm, the VC called in three platoons of
                paramilitary BDR to reinforce security on the campus where riot
                police were deployed earlier. At this stage, the protesters
                declared the venue of their sit-in a free zone. This prompted
                some 1,500 students to join the sit-in.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>Protests marked by the students' rendering songs continued
                until 3:45pm when police asked the protesters to leave the
                campus. &quot;The university has been declared closed. Leave the
                campus in three minutes,&quot; police continued saying through
                loudspeaker.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>As police threatened action in case of disobedience, the
                protesters including those who had been fasting since September
                2 started moving towards the Central Shaheed Minar. But police
                attacked them again near the Jagannath Hall of Dhaka University.
                <p>Dispersed by the firing of teargas canisters by police, some
                of the protesters took refuge in a nearby mosque. Police also
                fired teargas canisters inside the mosque. Besides, they kicked
                at least three female students namely Susan, Faria and Mahin of
                architecture department.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>Angered by the latest police action, the students staged a
                sit-in demonstration at the Jagannath Hall crossing, as police
                barred them from proceeding towards the Shaheed Minar. Police
                drove away a few students who managed to reach the Minar.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>Again, police asked the demonstrators to leave the spot in a
                minute. The protesters then moved to the TSC area of Dhaka
                University with police following them. Some of the protesters
                alleged that police took away their luggage kept in a bus, which
                was being used by police.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>The third round of police action against the protesters took
                place at the TSC area where another sit-in was staged at about
                5:40pm. They again used teargas and batons to scatter the
                agitators. The JCD activists also joined the police during the
                action.
                <p>&nbsp;
                <p>The agitating students staged their last sit-in behind the DU
                Central Library before police forced them out of the DU campus.
                Later on, the students marched towards the Jatiya Press Club</p>

  <p align="left">THERE are three issues that we want to comment on. First the
  police action, second the handling of the incident by the BUET authorities and
  the education ministry, and finally the demands of the students. We strongly
  condemn the police excesses and the brutal way in which they attacked with
  tear gas and baton charged the students. There was no reported violence in the
  events of Sunday that necessitated the use of such force. The police could
  have used peaceful means to disperse the students and clear the VC's office of
  the demonstrating students. Instead of calming the situation police went
  straight for the use of force which in fact turned the situation for worse
  than it needed to be. When asked the BUET VC said he ordered the deployment of
  police but professed ignorance about police brutalities. We consider the VC's
  action ill judged, resulting more from panic than from clear thinking.&nbsp; <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">....&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://dailystarnews.com/200209/10/n2091002.htm"><b><i>Read

  <p align="justify">BUET is passing through a grave crisis. And the crisis has
  deepened further with the police action against the agitating students on
  Sunday last. The university authorities failed to reach an understanding with
  the students, who had gone on a hunger strike to drive home their four-point
  demands.</p>
  <p align="justify">The BUET authorities could not do anything better than
  closing the university once again. The students were asked to vacate the
  dormitories, and academic activities in the country’s only university which
  was never known for strident and violent students politics, have been
  suspended, for the second time in less than three months.</font> <span style="mso-tab-count: 1">....&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="http://independent-bangladesh.com/news/sep/10/10092002ed.htm"><b><i>Read
