  the police crack down on the hunger-striking students I rushed to the BUET
  campus at around 5 p.m. I could not proceed across Shaheed Minar. Hundreds of
  police cordoned the Shaheed Minar Road that leads to BUET campus. No one was
  allowed to pass through the barricade. The area was smoked with tear gas- I
  myself felt some irritation in my eyes. I bought a bottle of water and
  refreshed my eyes. This reminds me those days of 52 – and 54- language

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Bangladesh University of
  Engineering and Technology, popularly known as BUET has been closed sine die.
  This is the second time BUET authority in collusion with government of Begum
  Khaleda had to close down the university against a popular movement of the
  common students of the university.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">First time, the BUET
  authority was forced to close down the university to curb the popular
  movements of the students launched against the university authority demanding
  the arrest of the culprits involved in the armed clash over tender between two
  rival groups of BNP armed cadres. The armed clash took place on 8<sup>th</sup>
  June which ultimately led to the sad killing of an innocent student named
  Sabekun Nahar Sony, a student of Chemical Technology, in the cross fire. The
  students revolted and launched a movement demanding immediate expulsion of the
  culprits and handing over them to the police. The authority of the university
  instead of responding to the demand of the students tried to protect the
  culprits, led by the armed cadre of BNP named Muji; 'Muki' is a terror and the
  university authority is very much afraid of him as he enjoys the blessings of
  the ruling party.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It is alleged that DSW
  (Director Student Welfare) who is supposed to look after the welfare of the
  students has been looking after the interest of the alleged culprits involved
  in Sonny killing event He is learnt to have commented that as Muki belongs to
  party in power the university authority cannot touch him!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The students forcibly confined three accomplices of Muki in a room at
  Rashid Hall on 8<sup>th</sup> June night. But with the help of the DSW they
  managed to escape from the hall of residence. Being afraid of the movement,
  the university authority closed down the university on 9<sup>th</sup> June.
  The authority asked the students to vacate the campus immediately; in fact
  they were driven out of the campus and hall of residences within an hour or
  so. Such is the inhuman attitude an unsympathetic behaviour the students got
  from the BUET administration.</p>

  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">During the closure of the
  university the BUET administration constituted an enquiry committee to go
  unveil the facts that led to the killing of Sony. The committee issued show
  cause notices to the students whom the thought were involved. But the notice
  were not published in any national dailies was widely circulated among the
  general students. The letter sent to different students wanted to know on the
  event of Sonny killing and events before and after Sonny-killing. The witness
  giving students alleged that members of the committee were more interested
  about the movement and students associated with the movement and who are
  leading it rather than identifying the culprits or the event itself. The
  members were harsh to the students, unsympathetic. Their very attitude is to
  stop the movement of the students demanding arrest and trial of the culprits.
  The committee found Muki and few others of his associates guilty, but it also
  found 10 others students guilty for indulging anti social and anti-academic
  activities before and after killing of Sony. The details of punishment given
  to these students are as follows: <o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b><u>Movement begins</u><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Under this backdrop, after
  about two months the university reopened for classes on 11<sup>th</sup>
  August. The conscious students of the campus rejected the findings of the
  enquiry committee and the prescription of behaviour of students. The students
  organized themselves under the banner 'Anti Terrorism BUET Students Unity'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>(Santras Birodhi Buet Chhatra Oikya) and launched a fresh movement
  against the university authority demanding the withdrawal of punishment given
  to the students who protested against the university administration's failure
  to curb terrorism, restore the academic atmosphere of the university in the
  campus and protect life and security of the students. The Students unity also
  demanded repeal of University Ordinance of 1961 that is still in vogue calling
  it as black law. A BUET teacher, keeping himself anonymous, told that the
  restrictions imposed on the students is to create panic among the students so
  that they do indulge themselves in non-academic, more particularly political
  activities. The teacher however said that would very likely be a boomerang.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The progressive teachers are
  very afraid of themselves and dare not speak out their mind. They are so
  afraid that cannot come forward to the cause of the students. As a result the
  repressive authority fearlessly is using the clauses of black laws against the
  students. And authority is claiming that its actions did have support of the
  teachers and common students at large. On the other hand the pro-government
  teachers are alleged to have threatening the common students that if they were
  found to violate the restrictions and abstain from classes their academic
  career would be ruined.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On the very day of opening on
  11<sup>th</sup> August the students lunched their 2<sup>nd</sup> phase of
  movement. Here is the chronology of the movement:&nbsp;<o:p>

  </span></span>The students held an assembly demanding to bring the killers to
  justice and withdrawal of punishment followed by angry protest processions in
  which hundreds of boys and girls participated. This annoyed the university
  administration. The authority responded by giving effect in a meeting of the
  academic council to the previously suspended expulsion orders. <span style="COLOR: blue">One
  may ask are the members of the academic council really teachers. Why not a
  single voice of protest is heard. I feel ashamed to call them as my esteem
  colleagues.</span> The authority brought substantial number of police forces,
  which almost kept, surrounded the BUET campus. The protesting students alleged
  that the authority has not cancelled the B.Sc. degree of the alleged killer
  Muki, so mere expulsion would not do any good. Two other alleged killers were
  given very minor punishment. On the other hand the authority has expelled a
  protesting boy named Subrata Sarkar, a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student of
  Architecture, for two terms permanently. The general students resent very much
  of the attitude of the authority by putting the killers and the protesting
  boys on the same balance. This enraged even the common students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The proposed column would
  have rectangular shape with height ~ 5'5&quot; ft and width 8 ft with a void
  at the centre of the wall depicting symbolically absence of Sonny. It would be
  made of black granite with a white background that would be erected on 1ft
  high platform made of red bricks. The black granite may be compared as a slate
  that was being used by sonny for his academic work, which remained unfinished
  because of her sudden death. The incomplete granite wall depicts this motif.
  The white background represents the society as a whole on which Sonny was
  brought in as a black granite- the blackness of it shows that she had to
  succumb to terrorism. On the white wall 4 lines of a poem composed by sonny
  herself would be engraved. The surroundings of the column would have a green

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It appears that there were no
  BUET administration. Nether the VC nor a single teacher of the University came
  forward to rescue the students from the police brutality. If the students were
  doing wrong or done any excess in the past, it is the moral responsibility of
  the teachers to induce the students. If the demands are right and lawful why
  then the teaches do not come forward on the side of the students and induce
  the BUET VC and his administration to reverse the decision of the disciplinary
  board. The BUET administration as if running a district infested with dacoits
  and thieves, terrorists and hooligans, not an educational Institution where
  matured and meritorious students are the most important element of the
  university. The BUE VC has left the administration to the SP, Police
  commissioners, OCs, havildars and sepoys. &nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The police once again
  dispersed the students on hunger strike from the area at around 9-30 a.m. In

  Sarkar, Debashish, Anupam, Saikat, Shanto, Kallol, Swapan, and Ruman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Debashis was beaten with a lathe at his legs. Police even barred the injured
  students to receive medical treatment at the BUET medical centre. &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The dispersed students once again slowly started
  reassembling at the cafeteria premises and continued their hunger strike. In
  the meanwhile a large students procession was brought out condemning the
  police brutality and immediate withdrawal of police from the campus. The
  processioninsts assembled at the cafeteria to encourage the students on hunger
  strike. The assembly was addressed by among others Bijoy Shankar Talukdar,

  striking students and to discuss with them if they are aware of the serious
  consequences and the stern attitude of the BUET administration. I was stopped
  at the main gate, a police officer enquiring - where to go and who am I. I
  said I am a University professor and wish to visit the students who are on
  hunger strike. The police officer gave me a salute and allowed me to pass
  through.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">I straight went to the cafeteria premise where students
  are fasting at about 5 p.m. To my utter surprise I found students were
  surrounded by a platoon of police force. And their very look is ferocious. I
  solaced the students and enquired their condition. They narrated that since
  morning the police is harassing them. Early in the morning the students
  decided that they would stay at the Shaheed Minar premise for hunger strike.
  But the police forcibly drove them away from the minar chattar. To me it
  appeared ridiculous. Every law abiding citizen including a BUET student have
  fundamental right to protest against any decision in a peaceful legal way.
  Hunger strike is a recognized non-violence method of protest. But neither the
  BUET authority nor the police seemed to acknowledge it. The BUET
  administration must have this elementary knowledge of our constitution. In my
  own way I sympathized with their cause but at the same time I urged them to
  open a dialogue with the BUET authority particularly with the newly appointed
  Vice Chancellor who, I guessed at that time, being an experienced teacher must
  have a soft corner for the students. My hope was if the VC is sympathetic he
  could always find a suitable way out and he would definitely not go for all
  out confrontation with his beloved students. I also asked the students
  assembled there to talk to their teachers who could play a decisive role in
  solving the problem. But to my utter surprise the successive events proved
  that I put my confidence on a wrong person.</p>

  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">While I was talking to the students on strike and their
  fellow students, a police officer came to me giving a smart salute. He very
  politely requested me to leave the place as the Vice Chancellor has standing
  directive no outsider should be here. He requested me ‘Sir, you better talk
  to the Vice Chancellor.‘ I had the least intention to argue with a petty
  officer. I told the officer not to resort to any brutal force to disperse them
  pointing out that they are peacefully observing their programme, why should
  you disperse them even if VC has ordered. I told the office that you have to
  assure me that you would not apply your platoon here to disperse the striking
  students. If you do so, I would not leave the place. The officer once again
  apparently very politely assured me that the police would not disturb them if
  they remain peaceful. I gave my assurance on behalf of the students urging the
  students not to be violent even against extreme provocation. I left the place
  at about 7 p.m.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

  Khan, dean faculty of electricity and electronics, Mohar Ali Bepari,
  Shorabuddin Ahmed, A FM<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anwarul
  Haque and Md. Shahjahan, registrar. In a written press statement the VC said
  that following the killing of Sonny the students who actively engaged in some
  anti social activities, before and after the killing event, that led
  destruction of properties, setting fire, etc. were given punishment as per
  findings of the disciplinary board. Number of such students are 23. Out of
  theses 4 were expelled for different terms for alleged involvement in
  Sonny-killing and one was expelled for his misbehavior, 15 were expelled for
  their involvement in destruction, setting of fire, scuffle etc, but their
  punishment kept abeyance, and 3 were simply cautioned. The VC explained that
  punishment meted to 15 boys would not be effective and their academic terms
  shall not affect if they behave properly in future. In all probability the
  suspended punishment would no be given effect to. The application of those
  students who have applied for exemption of punishments would be placed before
  the Academic Council for reconsideration. He further said once a court offered
  a verdict couldn’t be withdrawn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
  further commented that in comparison to total number of students reading in
  BUET number of students taking active part in the so-called movement is, he
  considers, only a handful. His stooge the director students’ welfare
  elaborated that total number students in BUET are few thousands whereas
  students participating in the movement would not exceed a few hundreds. So the
  number is surely insignificant. The director who is acting as an OC of a
  police station rather than a teacher claimed that BUET authority had no
  intention of punishing a single innocent student. He said that in pronouncing
  judgment the board of residence and discipline had taken into account of the
  subject matter of the editorial of the EUCSU magazine and events following it,
  academic performance of the students and many matters. How hypocritical he is.
  When asked why a student was served with a show cause notice for giving a
  press briefing following killing of Sonny, the director defended his action by
  saying that she was given any punishment- she was summoned to verify some her
  statements – particularly ‘ either the terrorists would stay or the
  general students stay in BUET campus.’ But our humble question is to the
  welfare director- even if she said so what is wring in it? Why she should be
  served with the show cause notice. Another question to this gentleman-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>what is wrong in the editorial of the magazine ? Isn’t a fact that
  Jamat, the collaborators of Pakistani military junta, is sharing state power
  with BNP who claimed to contribute in our war of liberation? Isn’t a

  found crying – they complained that the Shibir and Chhatradal cadre have
  severely assaulted their brothers and sisters who were fasting unto death for
  their cause.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">At one p.m. the police asked the students to vacate the
  office of the VC. As they refused to do police went into action by resorting
  to lathe charge and firing tear gas shell. The BUET campus turned into a
  battlefield.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">At about 3-45 p.m. police
  asked the reassembled students at the cafeteria premise to vacate within three
  minutes. But students refused to do so. The police at this stage took up the
  role of BUET administration. They announced that ‘please don’t spoil your
  career only for a few. Leave the campus within two minutes”. Police then
  kicked on student with his boot, another sepoy tear open the saline syringe of
  striking student. This caused bleeding, when a friend of his put his shirt on
  the injured place.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The students started moving
  toward the Central Shaheed Minar leaving the campus group by group. But the
  police intercepted them taking place at the Shaheed Minar. As the students
  went up the Minar police began lathe charging on the sick students and
  forcibly dispersed them. In this operation Susan Faria, Nahin, and Nandini
  were severely lathe charged. Susanta received a charge with a lathe and his
  hand broken. The police fired at least 20 rounds of tear shell at this time.
  The dispersing students took shelter inside BUET mosque premise. But the
  police then raided the mosque and fired tear gas shell within the mosque. The
  students taking shelter inside the mosque came out and took position on the
  open position at the crossing of roads between Jagnnath hall and BUET.
  Hundreds of students from the Shaheed Minar also took position there.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">At about 5 p.m. the police
  asked the students to disperse from there also. At the same time Mr. Hanif,
  erstwhile mayor arrived at the spot to express his sympathy with students’
  cause. He asked the attending police officer why the students were not allowed
  to sit at the Shaheed Minar Chattar to continue their hunger strike. The
  officer in charge simply said that it is the directives from the top that no
  assembly of students be allowed at the Shaheed Minar. The ex-mayor then
  assured the students that he would try to convince the higher authority of the
  police. Obviously Hanif’s attempt failed.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;Sooner the ex-mayor
  left the place police resorted to physical force to disperse the students.
  They were forced to leave the place and moved toward TSC of DU. They tried to
  reassemble at TSC crossing around the Raju Sculpture. Police tried to disperse
  them again using lathe-charge and firing tear-gas shells. 4 students defying
  the police action went up the Sculpture and put their banner to continue their
  hunger strike. The police severely beat them with lathe and batons. The police
  once again fired 10-12 round of tear gas shells to disperse them. With the
  police action group Chhatradal moved in with the police to disperse the
  students. One cadre of Chhatradal was heard saying “ Students of BUET have
  no place in DU campus”.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><u><b>Government in a dilemma</b></u><b>
  :</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;It was learnt the BUET
  was closed down at the directives of Prime minister herself. A rumour was
  spread at about 12 noon that a hunger striking student has succumbed to death.
  The rumour was found baseless. The critically ill student was removed to
  Bangabandhu hospital where he was admitted to CCU. Later on his condition
  improved. The students informed all concerned that he is out of danger.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The PM was present at
  the secretariat at that moment. Hearing this news she immediately ordered the
  relevant quarter to close down the university. On the BUET issue government
  had been in confusion for last few days. The saner elements wanted to solve
  the problem through negotiation cum persuasion with the students. But the
  harder elements thought otherwise. As a result the situation in BUET worsened.
  The BUET VC however denied any government intervention in closing down the
  university.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;On hearing the police
  crack down on the hunger-striking students I rushed to the BUET campus at
  around 5 p.m. I could not proceed across Shaheed Minar. Hundreds of police
  cordoned the Shaheed Minar Road that leads to BUET campus. No one was allowed
  to pass through the barricade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;Hundreds of students, I
  found, moving toward DU campus in a haphazard manner, - however the main
  stream of the students followed the path between Jagannath hall and DU
  teachers Residence which leads to TSC chattar and Raju sculpture. Some
  students dispersed to TSC premise via Doel Chattar in front of the Curzon
  Hall.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The area was smoked
  with tear gas- I myself felt some irritation in my eyes. I bought a bottle of
  water and refreshed my eyes. This reminds me those days of 52 – and 54-
  language movement.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I moved through Ramna Uddan
  following the stream of dispersing students and saw the brutal police action
  near Raju sculpture from the Uddan. The tear gas shelling, lathe charge and
  scuffling between police and students continued till 6 p.m. till all students
  assembling near TSC premise were completely cleared off. A procession of
  students then tried to move toward Shishu Park via Shahabag turn. As the
  broken procession reached near Matsya Bhaban police again resorted to lathe
  charge dispersing the students once again. I returned home at 7-30 p.m.
  witnessing once again how a state power could exhibit its ugliest face of
  torture through its law enforcing agencies like police and BDR, a drama in
  which police played the role of a supporting villein to a greater villein –
  the BUET VC.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The undaunted students of

  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Even the killer has his
  arguments in killing a person. So has the BUET VC who claims to be a teacher
  with a background of 30 years of teaching experience. I do not question his
  efficiency as a teacher in the classroom. But I wonder how a person like Ali
  Murtaza whose real character as a man and as a teacher has been revealed
  during last couple of weeks could become a teacher in a university where
  knowledge is created, disseminated generation to generation and liberalism
  grows. Something must be wrong with the educational system of BUET. Why
  instead of liberalism – the narrowness (kupamondukata), backwardness and
  overall inward looking culture are developing in BUET. &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The notorious VC has claimed
  his success in thrashing down the so-called movement of a handful of students.
  He posed a question after this success why should he resign- this he uttered
  unashamed in a press briefing following the close down of the university in a
  brutal way. The police-BDR joint action in implementing the desire of the VC
  resorted to force of unprecedented nature including lathe charge, tear gassing
  and baton charge, use of boot kicking, flooring down the girls by pulling
  their hairs–<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it even surpassed
  the brutality of Shamsunnahar Hall episode of DU. The VC once again reiterated
  his earlier stand that out of 4-5 thousand students of BUET 4-5 hundred
  students might speak out irrelevant remarks- why should I listen to them. He
  claimed that the university was closed down with the unanimous consent of the
  teachers. He further said that the university was closed down in order to
  restore the total discipline and restore academic atmosphere. &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Regarding police torture,
  brutality and excess committed on the students the learned (?) VC pleaded his
  innocence commenting that there might be some mild lathe-charge.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">He admitted that he has
  ordered the police-BDR to go to action to restore the authority of BUET
  administration within the campus and implement the decision of the closing
  down of the university. This means vacating the students from the hall of
  residence and the campus within less than an hour. In the press briefing he
  was helped by a few<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>of his
  lieutenant teachers namely, Joynul Abedin, director students’ welfare (dsw),
  Dr. Nizamuddin, Dr. Sohrabuddin ... . &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In a BTV interview the VC
  said same thing that he had to close down the university to restore and
  reestablish the BUET authority. It reminds me of the speech of Yahya Khan on
  the 26<sup>th</sup> December evening of 1971 after cracking down military
  force on the Bengalis that he had to order his military to reestablish the
  authority of Pakistan government on the soil of the then East Pakistan. What a
  close similarity in attitude and action !<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The VC said that the unruly students hearing the rumour that one
  hunger-striking student died locked the gate of his office and gheraoed him
  and his office staff. He claimed that due to mild police action in dispersing
  the students gheraoing him only 4-5 students received mild injuries. But real
  picture is not less 50 students were injured because of police brutality.
  &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">His lieutenant, the dsw who
  has been off late behaving more like a police officer rather than as a loving
  and sympathetic teacher once again justified pronouncing punishment against
  students who protested sonny killing and demanding the killers to bring to
  justice. He even went further to comment ill remarks about the elite who went
  to the BUET campus expressing the solidarity with the striking students. May
  very politely remind this acting police officer of BUET police substation that
  BUET is a public place any citizen, not to speak of respected intellectuals of
  different strata of the society, has every right to know and see what is
  happening in BUET campus and what the BUET authority doing in name of
  maintaining law and order. You can not stop, my dear dsw, public visitation,
  because we the public pay your salary and other fringe benefit that you are
  enjoying including the fine flat you are occupying and the allowance you are
  drawing as ‘dsw’. May I remind you, Mr. dws, that in Bangla there is a
