							<p align="justify">The government on Tuesday 
							withdrew the army camp from Dhaka University in the 
							face of student protest that continued for two days 
							beginning with the manhandling of some students by 
							army men at the university playground Monday 
							afternoon.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army men garrisoned at the university 
							gymnasium since January started leaving the campus 
							at about 10:45pm. Ten army trucks left the campus at 
							the time while clashes continued on the campus and 
							in some areas near by till 11:15pm.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 250 students were injured during the 
							agitation as the students fought pitched battle with 
							the police for two days.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agitation spilled outside the campus in Dhaka 
							and over to other campuses, where students demanded 
							that army camps should be withdrawn from all 
							educational institutions.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government on Tuesday decided to carry out a 
							judicial inquiry into the clashes and apologised for 
							the incidents.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 100 vehicles were damaged on and around the 
							campus. An army vehicle was set on fire between 
							Shahbagh and the Kantaban crossing. The students 
							also set fire to seven other vehicles on the campus 
							and on the Mirpur Road between Nilkhet and the 
							Science Lab, witnesses said.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the students brought out processions, the 
							police charged at them with truncheons, fired rubber 
							bullets and blank shots, and lobbed several hundred 
							tear gas canisters to tackle the situation. The 
							police also lobbed tear gas canisters inside the 
							halls of residence.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The university authorities suspended all the 
							examinations scheduled for a week amid a call for a 
							strike made by the students on Monday at all 
							educational institutions for an indefinite period.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrators burnt the chief adviser, 
							Fakhruddin Ahmed, in an effigy Tuesday afternoon. 
							The students also burnt two effigies of the army 
							chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, at Aparajeya Bangla on 
							the campus early in the day.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students of Dhaka College joined hands with 
							DU students in fight with the police Monday night.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoing the demand for the withdrawal of army 
							from educational institutions, students brought out 
							processions at Bangladesh University of Engineering 
							and Technology, Jagannath University, Sher-e-Bangla 
							Agricultural University, Kabi Nazrul College in 
							Dhaka, Jahangirnagar University, Rajshahi 
							University, Chittagong University, Shahjalal 
							University of Science and Technology in Sylhet, 
							Islamic University in Kushtia, Brajamohan College in 
							Barisal, and Michael Madhusudan College in Jessore 
							on Tuesday.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dhaka University Teachers’ Association at a 
							general meeting on Tuesday extended support for the 
							student demands and gave the authorities till 
							Wednesday noon to pull out troops from the campus.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers’ associations of Jahangirnagar 
							University and Rajshahi University also extended 
							their support for the demands of students.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RU teachers along with the students brought 
							out a procession on their campus on Tuesday. 
							Political parties and socio-cultural organisations 
							also extended their support for the students.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government expressed its regret at the 
							incident and gave an assurance of troop withdrawal. 
							The Inter Service Public Relations Department in a 
							release on Tuesday said that the soldiers involved 
							in Monday’s incident had been withdrawn and 
							proceedings had been initiated against them.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injured students received primary treatment 
							in Dhaka Medical College Hospital, the university 
							medical centre and Orthopaedics Hospital.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most students were injured in the head, leg and 
							hand. Some of them were injured with rubber bullets, 
							said Abdur Rahman, an officer at the university 
							medical centre.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clashes resulted from an altercation between 
							some students and some army men in plain clothes 
							watching a friendly football match at the university 
							playground Monday afternoon.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the army picked up some students, their 
							fellows gathered and protested at the incident. The 
							pro-vice-chancellor, AFM Yousuf Haider, who is now 
							acting vice-chancellor, and the proctor, Aka Firowz 
							Ahmed, reached the place to tackle the situation.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the matter could not be settled, the students 
							ran riot, bringing out processions and chasing the 
							police overnight. The police also chased the 
							students. More than 150 students were injured Monday 
							night as the police charged at them with truncheons, 
							fired rubber bullets and lobbed tear gas canisters.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acting vice-chancellor and the proctor were 
							beaten by the police when they were returning from 
							Dhaka Medical College Hospital after receiving first 
							aid as they had fallen ill in the clouding tear gas.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campus remained volatile overnight as the 
							residents stayed out of the halls of residence on 
							the street starting fires here and there.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students took to the streets Tuesday morning 
							defying heightened security after overnight clashes.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students in small processions gathered at 
							Aparajeya Bangla at around 10:00am and marched 
							towards the Curzon Hall in a large procession.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the procession reached the Raju Memorial 
							Monument, the police lobbed tear gas canisters. The 
							law enforcers also charged at the students with 
							truncheons and lobbed tear gas canisters inside the 
							Roquiah Hall.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the clash with the police, the students 
							gathered near the vice-chancellor’s house and 
							started throwing stones at the gate.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group reached Shahbagh and damaged more 
							than 50 vehicles. They burnt a military vehicle and 
							injured its driver.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the police attacked the students, they 
							retreated to the Institute of Fine Art and began 
							throwing stones at the police.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within minutes, the street became filled with 
							stones. The students started fire with tyres and 
							garbage every 20 yards along the street to weaken 
							the pungency of tear gas.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses said the police fired blank shots and 
							charged at the students inside the institute with 
							truncheons. The students retaliated and escaped by 
							breaking the wall between the fine arts institute 
							and the Institute of Business Administration.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police stopped all vehicle movement on the 
							campus and barricaded all the entry points.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicle movement stopped on the Mirpur Road 
							between the Science Lab and Nilkeht and on the 
							Elephant Road.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students under the banner of Students against 
							Repression at a briefing at Madhu’s Canteen in the 
							afternoon said they would enforce a strike for 
							indefinite period at all educational institutions 
							across the country if their demands were not met by 
							Wednesday.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They demanded a public apology from army chief, 
							Moeen U Ahmed, by Wednesday noon for the playground 
							incident.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students demanded punishment to the persons 
							responsible for the incident, proper treatment of 
							and compensation for the injured students, release 
							of the arrested and removal of all legal 
							obstructions to democratic movement.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also denounced censorship imposed on media 
							regarding the news of the agitation.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the briefing, a group of students, backed 
							by the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, brought out a 
							procession and demanded resignation of the army 
							chief and withdrawal of the state of emergency.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students of other universities and colleges 
							on Tuesday brought out processions demanding that 
							army men should be withdrawn from all educational 
							institutions.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students of the Bangladesh University of 
							Engineering and Technology formed a human chain on 
							their campus extending support for the student 
							demands.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students went out on demonstrations at Jagannath 
							University and set fire to three buses. The police 
							charged at the students with truncheons when they 
							encircled the university vice-chancellor, who was 
							getting off his vehicle. Three students were 
							injured. The students called for a strike for 
							indefinite period.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 10 students of the Sher-e-Bangla 
							Agricultural University in Dhaka were injured in 
							police action as they brought out a procession in 
							protest at Monday’s incident. The students 
							vandalised vehicles at the second gate of the 
							university at Agargaon.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students at Jahangirnagar University blocked the 
							Dhaka-Aricha Road at around 10:30am, vandalised 4 
							buses, 2 trucks and 2 police vans. Law enforcers 
							charged at the agitating students with truncheons.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students boycotted all the classes and 
							examinations on Tuesday and called strike for 
							Wednesday.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JU Teachers’ Association demanded withdrawal 
							of army camps from all universities and trial of the 
							army men responsible for the DU incident.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers and students of Rajshahi University, 
							wearing black badges, brought out a procession and 
							the police took away the banners.<br>
