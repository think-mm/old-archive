  <p>Not long ago, somebody asked me what kind of stories I wrote. Obituaries
  came to mind. As a reporter in Kashmir I have been literally writing
  obituaries for the past 10 years; only the characters and places change, the
  stories are always the same, full of misery and tears. And when in October
  last year I got a chance to leave Kashmir, I hoped for a change. Every human
  being has a threshold for pain and agony. I felt mine had been reached. I
  wanted to escape. But within days, Kashmir was in the headlines and although I
  was thousands of miles away, I found myself in the middle of it all again.</p>
  <p>I was born in Kashmir. I grew up in its apple orchards and lush green
  meadows, dreamed on the banks of its freshwater streams. I went to school
  there, sitting on straw mats and memorising tables by heart. After school my
  friends and I would rush half-way home, tear off our uniforms and dive into
  the cold water. Then we would quickly dry our hair, so our parents would not
  find out what we had done. Sometimes, when we felt especially daring, we would
  skip an entire day of school to play cricket.<br>
  <br>
  My village lies in the foothills of the Himalayas. During summer breaks, we
  would trek to the meadows high in the mountains carrying salt slates for the
  family cattle, sit around a campfire and play the flute for hours. The
  chilling winter would turn the boys and girls of our small village into one
  huge family - huddled together in a big room, we would listen to stories till
  late into the night. Sipping hot cups of the traditional salt tea, the village
  elder who had inherited the art of storytelling would transport us to the era
  of his tales. He had never been to school but he remembered hundreds of
  beautiful stories by heart. Kashmir was like a big party, full of love and
  life. Today death and fear dominate everything.<br>
  <br>
  I was in Kashmir too when the first bomb exploded in 1988. People first
  thought it was the outcome of a small political feud, although everybody knew
  the pot was boiling after years of political discontent. Then that September a
  young man, Ajaz Dar, died in a violent encounter with the police. Disgruntled
  by the farce of decades of ostensible democracy under Indian rule, a group of
  Kashmiri young men had decided to fight. They had dreamt of an independent
  Kashmir free from both India and Pakistan. Although this young man was not the
  first Kashmiri to die fighting for this cause, his death was the beginning of
  an era of tragedy.<br>
  <br>
  Separatist sentiment had been dominant among Kashmiris since 1947, when<br>
  Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan during partition, and the two<br>
  countries fought over it. But it was not until 40 years later that most of<br>
  the youngsters opted for guns against Indian rule, in reaction to the<br>
  government-sponsored rigging of the assembly polls, aimed at crushing<br>
  dissent.<br>
  <br>
  It is not a surprise that India's most wanted Kashmiri militant leader, Syed
  Salahudin, contested that assembly election from Srinagar, nor that,
  unofficially, he was winning by a good margin. When the elections were rigged,
  he lost not only the election but faith in the process as well. His polling
  agents and supporters were arrested and tortured; most of them later became
  militants.</p>
  <p><br>
  Neighbouring Pakistan, which occupies a third of Kashmir, also smelled the
  changing mood in Kashmir and offered a helping hand by providing arms training
  and AK-47 rifles. Violence was introduced amid growing dissent against India
  and hundreds of young people joined the armed movement. Kashmir was changing.</p>
  <p><br>
  I had just completed secondary school then and was enrolled in a college - a
  perfect potential recruit: the entire militant movement belonged to my
  generation. The movement was the only topic of discussion on the street, in
  the classroom and at home. Soon people started coming out onto the streets,
  thousands would march to the famous Sufi shrines or to the United Nations
  office, shouting slogans in favour of ' Azadi !' (freedom). These mass
  protests became an everyday affair, frustrating the authorities, who began to
  use force to counter them. Dozens of protesters were killed by police fire.</p>
  <p>Many of my close friends and classmates began to join. One day, half of our
  class was missing. They never returned to school again, and nobody even looked
  for them, because it was understood.</p>
  <p>Although the reasons for joining the militant movement varied from person
  to person, the majority of Kashmiris never felt that they belonged to India.
  What had been a relatively dormant separatist sentiment was finally exploding
  into a fully-fledged separatist uprising.<br>
  <br>
  I too wanted to join, though I didn't know exactly why or what it would lead
  to. Most of us were teenagers and had not seriously thought about the
  consequences. Perhaps the rebel image was subconsciously attracting us all.<br>
  <br>
  I also prepared for the dangerous journey from our village in north Kashmir to
  Pakistan-controlled Kashmir where all the training camps were. One didn't just
  have to avoid being sighted by the Indian soldiers who guarded the border
  round the clock, but also defeat the fierce cold and the difficulties of
  hiking over the snow-clad Himalayan peaks that stood in the way. I acquired
  the standard militant's gear: I bought the Wellington boots, prepared a
  polythene jacket and trousers to wear over my warm clothes, and found some
  woollen cloth to wrap around my calves as protection from frostbite.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, I failed. Three times a group of us returned from the border.
  Each time something happened that forced our guide to take us back. The third
  time, 23 of us had started our journey on foot from Malangam, not far away
  from my village, only to be abandoned in a dense jungle. It was night, and the
  group had scattered after hearing gunshots nearby, sensing the presence of
  Indian army men. In the morning, when we gathered again, our guide was
  missing. Most of the others decided to continue on their own, but a few of us
  turned back. We had nothing to eat but leaves for three days. We followed the
  flight of crows, hoping to reach a human settlement. I was lucky. I reached
  home and survived.</p>
  <p>As the days and months passed, and as the routes the militants took to
  cross the border became known to Indian security forces, the bodies began to
  arrive. Lines of young men would disappear on a ridge as they tried to cross
  over or return home. The stadiums where we had played cricket and football,
  the beautiful green parks where we had gone on school excursions as children,
  were turned into martyrs' graveyards. One after another, those who had played
  in those places were buried there, with huge marble epitaphs detailing their
  sacrifice. Many had never fired a single bullet from their Kalashnikovs.</p>
  <p>One day, I counted my friends and classmates in the martyrs' graveyards
  near our village. There were 21 of them. I could feel the smiling face of
  Mushtaq, whom I had known since our schooldays. He would have been 31 this
  January, but the ninth anniversary of his death is just two months away. He
  was killed in April 1993. His mother could not bear the pain and lost her
  mental balance. For all these years, she has been wandering around the
  villages carrying the shirt he wore on the day of his death.<br>
  <br>
  Another friend, Javaid, was his parents' only son. Extremely handsome, he was
  obsessed with seeing change in Kashmir. The day he died, he was wearing my
  clothes. He had come to our house in the morning and changed there. He was 23,
  and even six hours after his death, when they took him for burial, blood still
  oozed out of his bullet wounds. I will never forget the moment when I lifted
  the coffin lid away from his face: there was that usual grin. For a moment, he
  seemed alive to me.<br>
  <br>
  Javaid's sister was to have been married 15 days later but the shock of his
  death gave her a heart attack. She died a few days before what would have been
  her wedding day.<br>
  <br>
  Today, there are more than 500 martyrs' graveyards dotting Kashmir, and every
  epitaph standing on a grave tells a story - a tragic story of my generation.
  Engraving epitaphs has become a lucrative business.<br>
  <br>
  As the death toll of Kashmiris mounted, the world saw the violent movement
  only as the outcome of a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan which
  had its roots in the 1947 partition. India always called the rebellion a
  Pakistan-sponsored terrorist movement, while Pakistan projected it as a jihad
  - a Kashmiri struggle to join Pakistan just because they shared a common
  faith.<br>
  <br>
  For India, the future of Kashmir is non-negotiable - it is an 'integral part'
  of the country, the only Muslim majority state in the union and thus a
  cornerstone of its democracy and secular credentials. For Pakistan, Kashmir is
  also important because the majority of its population is Muslim - it is
  Pakistan's 'jugular vein', and an unfinished task from the subcontinent's
  partition in which Pakistan was born as a home for Indian Muslims.<br>
  <br>
  With these claims on Kashmir, both countries have choked the voice of
  Kashmiris. The Indian government has reacted with an iron fist, deployed large
  numbers of security men and turned Kashmir into one massive jail.</p>
  <p>Pakistan's hands are not clean either. When hundreds of thousands of
  Kashmiris came out in support of the separatist movement in 1990, Pakistan's
  lust for Kashmir's land was exposed. It hijacked the separatist movement,
  painted it with religious fundamentalism and introduced pro-Pakistan, and
  later jihadi groups to ensure it enjoyed absolute control.<br>
  <br>
  Within years, Kashmir turned into yet another battlefield in the pan-Islamic
  jihad and its warriors as well as its leaders were now made up of non-Kashmiris
  whose agendas transcend the demand for self-determination. In the process, the
  genuine political struggle for the unification of Kashmir and the demand of
  the people that they should be allowed to decide their own future was
  forgotten.<br>
  <br>
  Whatever attention Kashmir was given was because it was a flashpoint between
  two nuclear neighbours and not because Kashmiris were suffering. India and
  Pakistan seem to share one common policy on Kashmir - to force Kashmiris to
  toe their respective lines. In fact, it seems that both countries want to
  fight to the last Kashmiri.</p>
  <p>The Indian government held state elections in 1996 apparently aimed at
  ensuring a representative government in Kashmir. But actually it was nothing
  more than a farce. The security forces herded people to polling stations and
  even conducted 'nail parades' to check - by the indelible ink pasted on the
  nail of the forefinger - that people had voted.<br>
  <br>
  The man who represents Kashmir - not only in New Delhi, but across the world
  as India's junior Foreign Minister - is Omar Abdullah, the son of Kashmir's
  Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah. He received just 5 per cent of votes in his
  constituency - after coercion by the police and the security forces - and he
  won the elections. Who he does actually represent, nobody knows.<br>
  <br>
  I have been a witness to all this. I have seen Kashmir change. I still
  remember my grandmother worrying whenever the sky turned red. 'Murder has been
  committed somewhere,' she would say. Now that suspicion can no longer be
  reserved for red skies: the daily death toll is 20.<br>
  <br>
  Kashmir used to be known as a crime-free state. One of my neighbours was a
  senior police officer in the mid-Eighties; he once told me that the average
  yearly murder rate in Kashmir was three or four. Today, if three people perish
  in a day, itis considered peaceful.<br>
  <br>
  I have been fortunate enough to be safe, but my family and relatives have not
  been that lucky. My younger brother Mudabir was picked up in 1994 on suspicion
  of militancy, and it took us a month just to trace his whereabouts. We divided
  up the entire Kashmir valley among our family members. Every morning, each one
  of us would do the rounds of the security force camps to look for him.</p>
  <p>My mother had never been to a police station in her entire life, but by the
  time she finally located my brother, she knew almost every military camp
  around Srinagar.<br>
  <br>
  And by the time the security forces were convinced of his innocence and
  released him, he had already been tortured so much that he spent the next two
  months in bed.<br>
  <br>
  It is now seven years since his release, but he still has nightmares and the
  mere sight of a soldier sends shivers down his spine. A late-night knock at
  the door still gives him goose pimples, and sends his heart rate soaring. But
  this is not exceptional any more in Kashmir.</p>
  <p>A cousin's husband bled to death after he was caught in the crossfire while
  coming out of mosque one evening. He could have been saved had he reached the
  hospital in time. But the security forces did not allow the family to come out
  of their house and take him to the hospital, and there was no other way to
  seek medical help. He bled to death crying for help, and his wife, mother and
  younger brother could do nothing but watch their own helplessness. A boy was
  born in the family four months after his death.<br>
  <br>
  By 1992, there were hardly any young men left in the few villages in north
  Kashmir around my home. Many had joined the militant movement. Some had died,
  while others had gone underground; some had surrendered and become
  counter-insurgents and were part of the pro-government militias. Many had
  migrated to the urban area of Srinagar city, which was then deemed
  comparatively safe.<br>
  <br>
  The complexion of the separatist movement was changing fast, and it no longer
  represented the genuine political aspirations of the people. The pro-Pakistan
  jihadi groups who dominated the movement tried to impose their radical
  religious, social and cultural agendas, ignoring the fact that their extremism
  was alien to the very ethos of Kashmir.</p>
  <p>Kashmir has a history of composite culture and religious tolerance. In
  fact, Islam did not arrive in Kashmir through the clatter of the sword. It was
  introduced by mystics and Sufis who conquered the hearts of the people. In the
  centuries that followed, Kashmir turned into a melting pot of ideas and a
  meeting ground for Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam; there was no place for
  religious extremism.<br>
  <br>
  Now, as fanaticism started to dominate, using the power of the gun, the
  militant movement was rendered a mere tool in Pakistan's plan to bleed its
  arch-rival India with a thousand cuts.<br>
  <br>
  I decided to leave my village to move to Srinagar and join Kashmir University.
  I was so desperate to leave that I applied to almost all the departments. It
  was mere chance that I got into journalism. And when I started writing about
  the war later that year, I felt that I had been part of this tragic story from
  the beginning. I knew the militants and the mukhbirs (the police informers);
  those who surrendered and those who did not; those who faced death because
  they had a dream and those who were sacrificed by mere chance, neither knowing
  nor understanding the issues at stake; those who believed they were fighting a
  holy war and those who joined for unholy reasons. But, as it turned out, there
  was more to the story.</p>
  <p>My first assignment as a reporter was to visit a city police station and
  collect information regarding some corpses lying there. I accompanied a few
  local photographers, who began taking pictures as I stared at the six
  bullet-riddled bodies. They were in terrible condition: blood-soaked clothes,
  entrails exposed, faces unrecognisable.<br>
  <br>
  That evening, I was haunted by the picture of bodies lying in a pool of blood
  - even a drink of water reminded me of blood. I couldn't sleep for days;
  corpses haunted my dreams.<br>
  <br>
  A few months later I arrived at the site of a massacre to find wailing women
  and unshaven men sitting in huddles. Bodies lay scattered, like rag dolls
  discarded by careless children. I felt a lump growing in my throat, my legs
  felt heavy. I felt incredibly tired and wanted to throw down my notebook and
  sit silently with the mourners. The noise of the camera shutters invaded my
  private thoughts, forcing me to think about the story I had to write.</p>
  <p>Over the years, writing obituaries became a routine. When violence rules
  the day, there is nothing but tears to jerk out of the reader's soul. If I
  avoided writing about the gory details of death, I would end up writing about
  orphans or widows. In the process, my reactions to such incidents also began
  to change. I could no longer relate to these tragedies. Now killings meant
  stories and bylines, and there was satisfaction to be found in penning them,
  even if I knew the victims personally.</p>
  <p>The continuous interaction with death and destruction was providing a
  necessary thrill, and the killing fields of Kashmir were becoming nothing but
  news pastures for me. Every evening, I would wait for the police bulletin that
  provides the statistics of the daily deaths. Much as a shopkeeper counts his
  cash before calling it a day, I would count the dead before leaving the
  office. I once used a calculator to count the 105 men and women dead across
  the 12 districts in 24 hours. My newspaper wanted a breakdown and I found
  myself lost in numbers.</p>
  <p>I belong to Kashmir's cursed generation - the youth of the Nineties. I have
  lived all these troubled years in Kashmir and am still well and alive. But in
  the process my tears have dried up. I have lost normal human feelings to the
  adventures of reporting day-to-day violence in my country. I am immune to the
  death of my own people; I have developed an inability to mourn.<br>
  <br>
  And it seems that the outside world too is unable to feel the pain of Kashmir.
  After more than 50,000 deaths, there still appears to be no headway towards
  peace. The international community needs to resolve issues between India and
  Pakistan. It is not only important in order to avoid a nuclear conflict: it is
  imperative to end the suffering of the Kashmiri people.<br>
