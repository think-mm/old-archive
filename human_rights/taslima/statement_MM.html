  Muzzling Taslima Nasrin a la Bangladeshi style</span></b></font></p>

  <font face="Arial" color="#000080">Bangladesh's judiciary proved it again that
  they are not free. <b>Mukto-Mona, an assembly of freethinkers mostly from
  Bangalee descent in the Internet, strongly denounces the recent verdict of an
  obscure court located in the backwater of Bangladesh vis-à-vis the feminist
  writer Ms. Taslima Nasrin.</b> The suddenness of the court verdict surprised
  most freedom-loving Bangalees. And worst of all, no attorney had represented
  Ms. Taslima Nasrin at the court. Therefore, it was a one-sided affair. This is
  what is called - justice in Bangladeshi style!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080"><br>
  Ms. Taslima Nasrin is a prisoner of conscious. Beginning from her childhood,
  she saw repression against our womenfolk in Bangladesh. Similar to the action
  of a volcano, her rage, anger, disbelief, and all the incongruities of our
  repressive society pushed her to the brink of fervidness. She did what a
  volcano does when excess pressure builds up inside it. It simply erupts. In
  her case, the catalyst was the post Babri Mosque riot in southern districts of
  Bangladesh. Her cry for justice reverberated in her book Lajja (Shame). And
  cry she did. Most folks in Bangladesh those who lack a &quot;third eye&quot;
  saw the vulgarity in her novice write-up. And they cried foul. &quot;Death to
  Taslima&quot; was the shrill cry from Mullahs. Ms. Taslima Nasrin had to look
  for a safe place in abroad. She has been living in exile not through her
  choice. Fundamentalist Muslim clerics lead a violent campaign at that time for
  killing her and&nbsp; prize was set for her head in response to her books and
  articles. Her life is vulnerable in all parts of Bangladesh since a big chunk
  of the nation has trodden the path to Islamism. Throughout the period of her
  unhappy exile from Bangladesh, Dr. Nasrin constantly spoke of her love for her
  homeland and her people, and of her desire to return to her home. For a brief
  period, she returned to Bangladesh in 1998 under difficult circumstances, just
  to be near her dying mother. After her mother's demise, she returned to
  Europe. For a while, she lived in Kolkata to be imbued by the ambiance of
  Bangalee culture as She was missing her motherland dearly. The Moderator of
  Mukto-mona and the members have worked closely with Dr. Nasrin in recent years
  of her exile and have found her to be an outstanding representative of the
  rich culture of Bangladesh. <b>Our forum is proud to count Dr. Nasrin among
  its members, and will be unstinting in its efforts to defend this courageous
  champion of human rights.</b><br>
  <br>
  Now by <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/8127" target="_blank">the
  verdict of a lone magistrate from Goplaganj</a>, Bangladesh, Ms. Taslima
  Nasrin's fate is sealed again. But it has raised one question in the minds of
  many freethinkers. Is the judiciary in Bangladesh really free? Past history
  shows us that the same judiciary decided to defer the verdict of Sheikh
  Mujibur Rahman killing of August 15, 1975. Similarly, the case against
  Shaik-ul Hadis Maulana Azizul Hoque, the head of Islamic Oikkyo Jot, for
  killing police constable Badsha Miah in Jamia Muhammadia Arabia Madrassah
  Complex on February 3, 2001, was thrown out soon after the caretaker
  government sworn into the office in July 2001. The highest seat of judiciary
  in Bangladesh, the Supreme Court, who are too afraid to touch the case of
  Sheikh Mujib killing with a seven-feet pole was too eager to give verdict
  against Bangladesh's premier private TV channel Ekushey TV. It seems as if the
  judiciary is bent on giving verdict against any person or institution that has
  a tinge of secularism written all over it while the religionists have a field
  day getting a reprieve from the court. This is simply a mockery of justice in
  Bangladesh.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080"><br>
  We, the Mukto-Mona forum appeal to the conscious of all freedom-loving people
  of the world to condemn the verdict meted out by the court of a magistrate in
  Bangladesh where the feminist writer Ms. Taslima Nasrin was
  &quot;convicted&quot; for a crime she did not commit in the first place. She
  exercised her inalienable right -- freedom of speech -- to speak her mind. The
  religious fanatics in Bangladesh say her writings are blasphemous. However,
  since Bangladesh is yet to have any blasphemy law in the book, one of them
  lodged a case against the writer by stating that her writings had hurt
  &quot;religious sentiment of the Muslims.&quot; She was tried in absentia and
  not only that there weren't any lawyer to defend her in the court of law.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080"><br>

  <b>Therefore, not only the court verdict be annulled, the case against the
  writer should also be withdrawn unequivocally right away.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080"><br>
  <b>We demand from Mukto-mona to the government of Bangladesh to allow Ms.
  Taslima Nasrin to return to Bangladesh. The government must also provide
  safety for the writer and her immediate family.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Finally, the government should foster
  freethinking and defend the article of free speech as provided by the
  constitution of the land. To show that the government is serious about
  instituting the free speech clause of the constitution, <b>all the orders for
  banning books in Bangladesh including the ones written by Ms. Taslima Nasrin
  should be rescinded right away.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080">What we want to see ultimately is the
  re-institution of secularism in our motherland. The country for sure was
  established at the high cost of a supreme sacrifice from 3 million lives in
  1971 to foster secularism, egalitarianism, and democracy in the land of free.
  Let us all work for that cherished goal.</font></p>
