  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Writer-poet-humanist Taslima
  Nasrin once again on the news in BD presses. A magisterial court at Goplagang
  Sadar Zila town pronounced a verdict giving one-year non-rigorous imprisonment
  to Taslima Nasrin. She was found guilty of a case insulting Islam and hurting
  the feelings of its followers through her writings in newspapers columns and
  novels including ‘Ma’ and ‘Lajja’.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In 1999, one Dabiruddin Azad
  of Goplagang lodged a case in Goplagang Magistrate Court against Ms Taslima
  Nasrin alleging that her novels and columns in news papers insinuating
  religion of Islam has hurt the feelings of millions of Muslims in Bangladesh
  and outside. After preliminary hearing the case was accepted by the court. But
  since then it was shelved. In 2001, a few months before general election
  during the fag end of AL government, the case was revived again- a report was
  published in ‘Sangbad’ that almost 80% of hearing was complete. But to my
  utter surprise I noted that Taslima had no defence council to defend her. She
  was being tried in absentia.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I immediately traced out the
  case- and found it was filed by a person individually as per 298 Act. It was
  not a government case. I got in touch with Ain-o-Salis Kendra who assured me
  that they would take up the matter and do the needful. A few weeks later Dr.
  Hamida Hosain of ASK informed me that an advocate has been engaged to look
  after the case of Taslima providing necessary defense. I felt assured. Nothing
  was heard since then. I thought that the case might have been dropped or
  shelved in a cold storage.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">But alas, court was not that
  forgetful as I thought. The case was again opened and after three years, the
  Gopalganj Magistrate court pronounced the verdict of the case on all a sudden
  on Saturday, September 12, 2002. In his 31-page verdict, the magistrate found
  Ms Nasrin guilty of offending the sentiments of Muslims through her writings.
  As she is absconding the punishment would take effect from the very day she
  would be arrested by the BD police. Advocate Nahaj Pasha conducted the case on
  behalf of the plaintiff, on the other hand defendant had no councilor, even
  government did not provide any one. This surprised me because I was assured by
  ASK that a proper defense mechanism would be provided to Taslima when the case
  is reopened. Alas poor Taslima- even her well wishers are so forgetful !</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Since she published her novel
  ‘Lajja’ (Shame) based on communal riots in some parts of Bangladesh,
  particularly in southern districts including Bhola and Barisal that took place
  in 1992 following the destruction of Babri Masjid in UP by a group of Hindu
  fundamentalists, she has been forced out to live abroad in order to avoid
  wraths of the Islamists fundamentalists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Bhola was worst affected district. But the then government of BNP led
  by our great lady Madam Khaleda did not take any note of it, on the other hand
  she expressed thousands of Sukria to her countrymen that Muslims of Bangladesh
  did not take any revenge against the Hindus in BD. This very attitude of
  government enraged Taslima to write ‘Lajja’ for which she paid a price so
  high that she has to live abroad on the charity of some western benevolent
  friends and well wishers of her.</p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText">On the other we her countrymen could offer only
  distress and antipathy. Even we could not make her life safe for her against a
  handful of vocal terrorists in the name of Islam. This lajja of ours has no
  limit.</p>

  talked to many of her so-called well wishers. But I developed a feeling that
  some sorts of antipathy exists against her including among many of the
  feminist leaders here. No one wants to take up the problem of Taslima with
  serious note. One after one of her publications is declared banned, but even
  the secular intellectuals raise no serious protesting voice. We are so afraid
  of the fundamentalists and the present government, which include
  fundamentalist elements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
  there any hope for this country ? I wonder.</span></font></font><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
