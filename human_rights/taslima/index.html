  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><br>
  </span><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Mukto-Mona,
  an assembly of freethinkers mostly from Bengali descent in the Internet,
  strongly expresses its deep concern over the recent verdict of a magisterial
  court of Gopalganj district that pronounced one year imprisonment on humanist
  writer Ms. Taslima Nasrin in a case where she was charged with hurting
  religious sentiments of followers of Islam through her writings.</span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:blue;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">
  </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The
  suddenness of the court verdict surprised most freedom-loving Bengalis. And
  worst of all, <b>no attorney had represented Ms. Taslima Nasrin at the court.</b>
  Is it not a violation of natural justice? As<b> </b>she was tried in absentia,
  should not the court provide her with a defence councillor?</span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Ms. Taslima Nasrin is a prisoner of conscience<b>.</b>
  Beginning from her childhood, she felt pains of</span><span style="font-family:
Arial;color:green;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> </span><span style="font-family:
Arial;color:navy;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">repression against our womenfolk and
  saw injustice and incongruities of our repressive society in Bangladesh. Her
  feelings and observations were reflected in her columns and other writings.</span><b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial; color: green; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">&nbsp;
  </span></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Arial; color: navy; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">When she saw that post Babri Mosque riot directed
  against a weaker section of our citizens practicing a different religion in
  southern districts of Bangladesh was not admitted by the then government and
  nor was it severely condemned by our society, she erupted like a volcano. She
  protested against this crime against humanity in her own style by writing a
  most debatable novel ‘Lajja’ (Shame) depicting the injured feelings of
  Hindu minorities - their pains and sufferings. She was criticized by the
  conservatives as well as some liberals that ‘Lajja’ would destroy the
  image of Bangladesh as a country of communal harmony abroad, on the other
  hand, a section of our civil society criticized her book as saying it has no
  or little literary value. No one seem to appreciate the well intended contents
  of the book picturing pains, agony, silent crying and sufferings of a section
  of our population practicing a different faith. Her cry for justice
  reverberated in her book.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Instantly, she became the target of Islamic
  fundamentalists and conservatives. The silent supporters of hers and the
  progressive elements of our society felt helpless against the violent reaction
  of hand full of ‘Mullahs’. <b>A prize for head was fixed and death penalty
  was pronounced by them. Elected government(s) of Bangladesh failed to provide
  adequate safety of life of a popular columnist, poet and a novelist. Her life
  became vulnerable in Bangladesh- she was forced to go to exile.</b></span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Throughout the period of her unhappy exile from
  Bangladesh, Dr. Taslima Nasrin constantly spoke of her love for her homeland
  and her people, and of her desire to return to her homeland. For a brief
  period, she returned to Bangladesh in 1998 under difficult circumstances, just
  to be near her dying mother. Even at that time of sorrow, her life was made
  miserable by the fundamentalists. After her mother's demise, she had to return
  to Europe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">While working with her in many of our humanistic
  activities, ‘Mukto-mona’ found in her a true representative of Bengali
  culture. Our forum is proud to count Dr. Nasrin among its members, and will be
  unstinting in its efforts to defend this courageous champion of human rights.</span></b></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;

  Goplaganj</a></span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">,
  Bangladesh, Ms. Taslima Nasrin's fate is sealed again unless she is allowed to
  appeal to the High Court in absentia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">But it has raised one important question in the minds
  of many freethinkers - is the judiciary in Bangladesh really free? Can it,
  particularly at the lower level, work or allowed to work independently? We
  refer to the recent debate going on between the government and<b> </b>Supreme
  Court regarding independency of judiciary from executive control. There are
  many instances where justice have been either delayed or denied, and our
  highest judiciary system knows it- we do not have to remind them. There are
  many instances where judgement of the courts were not appreciated by a large
  section of common mass- the case of ETV is just one example.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The other day, retired chief justice Mostafa Kamal
  unequivocally remarked in a seminar on ‘Administration of law and judiciary
  of Bangladesh’ (Sangbad, 19. 10. 02) that no ‘judicial trial’ would get
  internal or universal acceptability unless the entire judiciary system were
  ‘made free and independent’. Barrister Rafiqul Haque, retired attorney
  general said ‘Our judiciary has been polluted by political as well as
  executive interferences.’ These remarks led to many common citizens to
  question ‘do we rally get true justice or mockery of justice in Bangladesh
  ‘?</span></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">We, members of the Mukto-Mona forum appeal to the
  conscience of all freedom-loving people of the world to express our concern
  over the verdict meted out by the court of a magistrate in Bangladesh</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">

  <span style="font-family: Arial; color: navy; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">What
  we want to see ultimately is the re-institution of secularism in our
  motherland. The country for sure was established at the high cost of a supreme
  sacrifice by the 3 million lives in 1971 to foster secularism, egalitarianism,
  and democracy in the land of ours. Let us all work for that cherished goal.</span>
