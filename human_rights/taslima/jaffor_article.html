  </span>Her writings were mostly on women’s rights or its lack thereof in

  demolition in Ayodha on December 6, 1992.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Several communal riots had surfaced spontaneously in the southern
  districts of Bangladesh, in the aftermath of that incident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Many Hindus suffered in the hands of communal Muslims in Bangladesh;
  some were even murdered in cold blood for the sins committed by many Sadhus in
  Ayodha.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The world of Taslima
  Nasrin became askew by these inhumane brutalities meted out by Muslim fanatics
  against the Hindus in rural Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under

  non grata</i> among her own people in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Since she wrote scathingly against communalism after the riots in
  Bangladesh in post Babri Mosque incident and touched on the incongruities of
  Islamic teaching vis-à-vis women’s rights in Muslim societies, she was
  labeled immediately a blasphemous writer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The recalcitrant Mullahs of Bangladesh offered several <i>fatwas</i>
  (edicts) against the humanist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bangladesh
  court could not have done anything to the writer because no blasphemy law
  exists in the constitution or in law book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The Mullahs relentlessly however staged many protests, which are
  lovingly called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

  her life became vulnerable in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>No one really could safeguard her life inside Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The government was not in the mood to provide her police protection to
  safeguard the life of writer or the lives of her immediate family member.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  was that she spoke her mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
  people in Bangladesh however heaved a great sigh of relief knowing that the
  feminist writer no longer lives in their country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The Islamists however took no time to trash her novel <i>Lajja</i>
  because it contained, according to them, some blasphemous statements; the
  literati of Bangladesh discounted her book calling it a vacuous writing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  briefly returned to Bangladesh to stay near her dying mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Even then, her sworn enemies, i.e., Islamists were making enough noise
  in the streets of Dhaka.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
  quickly returned to Sweden -- her adopted home -- after her mother had passed
  away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The strain of living in
  exile in a country, whose culture is all but alien to her, took toll on her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>She became restive and forlorn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
  peripatetic life brought her back to Bengal for a short time to assuage her
  mental agony and anguish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
  her destination was Kolkata this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
  wanted to smell, touch, and feel the ambiance of Bengal, which was amiss in

  </span>Her writings continued nonetheless and the following books were
  published not only in Bangla but also in few European languages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  </span>Her latest book <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Taslima
  Nasrin’s enemy in Bangladesh, which she has many, are not sitting idle
  either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One such person by the
  name Dabiruddin Azad lodged a civil case in 1999 against the author in
  Gopalgang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Magistrate Shah Alam
  who gave verdict against Taslima Nasrin on October 13, 2002 heard the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The magisterial court had ordered one-year prison term to the humanist

  including <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lajja</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>

  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Mind you, Ms.
  Nasrin’s books are all published in foreign soils.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>No publishers in Dhaka would dare to publish her writings for the fear
  of reprisals from Islamists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
  then, she was not spared from the wrath of her un-compassionate enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Freedom of speech does not mean much in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Nor do our folks understand how to exercise their inalienable rights to
  not read or browse any books or articles that they think might be injurious to
  their mental health.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One thing is
  sure that Bangladesh is most certainly veering towards free market economy. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>But her citizens have hard times understanding that market
  force may wipe out the writings of any reckless writer.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They have no reason to be concerned about Ms. Nasrin’s
  articles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If her writings were
  that bad, the market force would work against them and none would buy her
  books.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">In developed
  nations, no books are banned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
  successful writer earns a solid reputation through good reviews of his or her
  work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the market force
  works to weed out pathetic writers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
  is no reason to engage in vilification campaign against any author in the
  civilized world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bangladesh
  should also follow this practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Going back to
  the issue of lodging a case against Taslima Nasrin by one Dabiruddin Azad it
  is not clear whether it was a class action suit or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In class action litigation, many people sign a document by pledging
  their support against one company or a person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We don’t know whether the case against Taslima Nasrin by the
  plaintiff was a class action suit or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If this legal harangue by Dabiruddin Azad against the author of Lajja
  was not a class action suit, then, the plaintiff cannot say that Ms.
  Nasrin’s writings have hurt the “religious sentiments” of other citizens
  of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In a civil litigation, it is quite difficult to prove that
  indeed the novel <i>Lajja</i> has done harm to any person.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Why did the plaintiff read the book in the first place that
  was not even published in Bangladesh?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
  an adult, he should have exercised caution reading <i>Lajja</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The other anomalous thing about Ms. Nasrin’s case in the magisterial
  court of Gopalganj is that no solicitor was present to argue the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Also, because of the nature of the civil litigation concerning a
  feminist writer, the case should have been transferred to Dhaka.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>To try the writer in absentia and without any defense lawyer present in
  the court it seems as if the magisterial court was transformed into a kangaroo
  court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It speaks badly about the
  honesty and integrity of free judiciary in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It was mentioned in the newspaper that the author might appeal the
  decision of the lower court to the higher court.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It is doubtful if Ms. Nasrin would tread a treacherous path
  to come down all the way to Gopalganj from her exile to extricate her from the
  legal mess created by the judiciary in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Any erudite magistrate could have lectured the plaintiff
  telling him that he should exercise caution while choosing what to read.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A sensible Bangalee would stay away from reading or browsing a smut or
  any other mild pornographic periodicals because this may cause perturbation of
  his or her mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same token, individuals in Bangladesh should exercise
  caution while viewing myriad channels that come into their groove box via
  satellite dish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They cannot take
  the producer of a show where scantily dressed women are seductively posing to
  induce libido in males.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  bottom line is the use of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
  the same vein, many folks in Bangladesh who think that Ms. Nasrin’s novels
  would cause mental stress and confusion, should better exercise their
  discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This rather
  vindictive attitude of many of our people speaks in volume the malice our
  people harbor against any secular writer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Also, one could think that the erudite judiciary of Bangladesh could
  easily see the frivolity that is associated with the case of bringing a civil
  case against any writer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
  thing the magistrate or the judge has to say to the plaintiff, “Just don’t
  read Ms. Nasrin’s novel.”&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><font color="#000080">Ms. Nasrin
  should not lose her sleep over the court verdict of a lone magistrate from the
  hinterland of Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
  should turn this court verdict into an accolade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Her brushes with the law in Bangladesh should give her enough
  inducement to write more forcefully against all the incongruities Bangladesh
