    <p class="center" align="center">(A Report from Ahmedabad, Gujarat)</p>
    <p class="center" align="center"><b><font color="#ff0000">&quot;The
    connotation of the word secular should mean negation of all religions&quot;</font></b></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="initial">C</span>ommunal riots are an
    indicator of socio-cultural schism existing between the communities. Every
    communal riot not only deepens this schism and hardens the socio-cultural
    divide, new found factors and reasons get added to the divide. The recent
    communal riots in Gujarat and the horrendous carnage perpetrated during
    these riots have shocked all sensible persons and has reemphasized the need
    for bridging this gap and evolving an integrated and harmonious human
    society which is an essential component of a nation. It is necessary to
    analyze the causes behind the communal riots and widespread violence in
    Gujarat as well as their dangerous implications.</p>
    <p class="subheadline"><b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff">NEW
    FEATURES</span></b></p>
    <p class="paragraph">It could be observed that riots are no more
    instantaneous incidents caused by some mischief-mongers, and riots
    themselves being thinly spread and/or of short duration. They have become a
    form of collective violence - something like a continuous battle between two
    communities. Over the years they have become more organized, planned and
    devastating. Despite the efforts of well intentioned and sober people from
    both the side, the suspicion and hatred have steadily penetrated the masses
    and spilled over into rural areas as well. The influence and impact of
    people advocating tolerance, amity and harmony have dwindled to such an
    extent that now they find themselves not only impotent, helpless and
    ineffective but often ridiculed or attacked for their views. This regression
    of liberal ethos and assertion of fascist psyche by fundamentalist groups
    and leaders amongst the masses are portents of the horrible future ahead.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">We must understand that the communal violence in
    Gujarat was triggered by the Godhara carnage, where more than fifty people
    were burnt to death in the coach of a train, attacked by a big Muslim mob,
    armed with weapons and inflammable material. The resultant shock and
    repercussions were widespread. However, the economic, political, social,
    psychological and cultural climate prevailing in Gujarat was responsible for
    its widespread, intense and unremitting nature. The identification and
    evaluation of these causes and finding its remedy is necessary if we want to
    stop its recurrence and reverse the process of communalization of our
    society.</p>
    <p class="subheadline"><b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff">WHY IN
    GUJARAT?</span></b></p>
    <p class="paragraph">It is surprising - and many people are surprised - how
    and why the tolerant, mild mannered, amicable and peace-loving people of
    Gujarat have, since 1942 have come to acquire such a violent communal
    personality since the inception of the state. Many find it ironical that
    Gandhi’s Gujarat can behave in such a fashion. It may sound rhetorical but
    let me add that it is also the Gujarat of Mohammad Ali Jinnha, Chundrigar,
    Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Advani, K. K. Shastri (VHP president), and Pravin
    Togadia (VHP secretary)! This is just to point out that Gujarat’s
    socio-cultural milieu has diverse strains and its simplification as one
    homogenous entity could be misleading.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Geographically Gujarat is a border state; its northern
    border touches Pakistan. After partition hoards of Gujaratis and Sindhis
    came to Gujarat as ‘NIRVASIT’. Their traumatic experience of the
    partition added to the psyche of Gujarat – along with the historical story
    of the demolition of the Somanath temple. To these, the riots of forties,
    fifties sixties and seventies – largely initiated by Muslims, have
    contributed to the popular perception of a Muslim as aggressive and communal
    person.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The violent clashes between the two communities during
    these riots led to the segregation of Hindu and Muslim localities. This
    segregation affected the younger generation as they had no live social
    contacts with each other, they studied in different schools and the link of
    friendship or communication or understanding each other’s feelings, became
    very tenuous. As the frequency of riots increased (nearly more than a score
    in six decades), socio-cultural bonds between the communities started
    fading. Lack of neighborly relations and communication provided the fertile
    ground for the fundamentalist propagandists to cause misunderstanding,
    suspicion and hatred between the two communities. Further, amongst the
    Muslims, Madrasas became the recruiting grounds for the fundamentalists. In
    this atmosphere even the farfetched rumors like poisoning of the water
    supply or milk-distribution system acquire credence.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Events of last decades, like upsurge of Muslim
    fundamentalism, conflict in middle-east and Kashmir, disintegration of USSR
    and formation of the Muslim republics, increasing terrorist attacks and
    hijackings, cases of Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasrin, along with the
    climate created by the issues of Ramjanmabhumi controversy and individual
    cases like Shahbanu case (reiterating separate Muslim personal law) at home
    have reinforced the perception of categorizing Muslim personality as
    aggressive, amongst the Hindus. Rise of Taliban, attacks on Hindus in
    Kashmir, on World Trade center, Jammu-Kashmir legislature, Indian parliament
    etc have reinforced this perception and has got extended even to the
    educated middle-class Hindu.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><b>The issue is not whether the inference on the part
    of the Hindus in context of these problems was right or wrong. What matters
    is the perception that has developed in <font color="#ff0000">Hindu psyche</font>
    and which has hardened their attitude towards Muslims as a whole.</b> This
    perception was a contributory factor in the widespread and immediate flaring
    up of riots in large part of Gujarat in the wake of the shocking carnage at
    Godhara.</p>
    <p class="subheadline"><b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff">CONTRIBUTING
    FACTORS</span></b></p>
    <p class="paragraph">There is a causal link between violence and
    deprivation. Any form of deprivation leads to frustration which in turn
    produces anger responsible for aggression or an act of violence. Sense of
    deprivation is a personal perception. When a gap between expectation and
    achievement develops due to change in economic, social and political
    situations or psychological reasons, deprivation sets in at individual
    and/or group levels.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The economic situation is particularly related with
    Ahmedabad. Besides, Ahmedabad being the main city of Gujarat, whatever
    happens here has, sooner or later, repercussions or contagious impact on
    other parts of Gujarat as well. During last three decades a large number of
    textile mills in Ahmedabad have closed down. This has adversely affected the
    economic life of many, especially the economically disadvantaged sections of
    both the communities. A large number of mill-workers became unemployed. Most
    of them belonging to Muslim and backward class communities and even middle
    class Hindus were forced to search for alternative means of livelihood. They
    felt deprived and frustrated. The persistence of this situation over the
    years has provided a mass of people readily available for any aggressive
    act. Another incidental, yet significant aspect of this closure of mills is
    related with an agency which could defuse communal tension and maintain
    communal harmony. A major union of the textile workers known as Majoor
    Mahajan (inspired by Gandhiji and run by Gandhian leaders) was reduced to
    irrelevance. It lost the capacity to influence the working class communities
    and defuse or minimize or stop the communal violence. It is interesting to
    note that where such labor unions are strong (e.g. Ahmedabad Electricity
    Company – started by Humanists) they can pre-empt or contain the effects
    of the riots. It seems that in absence of such an agency appeals for peace
    or ‘Shanti Yatra’ have no tangible impact.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">After closure of the textile mills, unemployed mass of
    the mill-workers was in search of jobs. Some were absorbed in the power loom
    industry. But many of them were enticed by the illegal activity like
    smuggling and bootlegging. As Gujarat is a border state Pakistan-Gujarat
    border became a route for smuggling and Pakistani agent provocateurs.
    Extensive sea coast has attracted smuggling from the Middle Eastern Muslim
    countries. Naturally many Muslims got recruited in this activity. With the
    passage of times they became transformed into organized gangs and acquired
    arms and some position in their community as they provided patronage.
    Another group of organized crime was connected with bootlegging. The
    prohibition policy of Gujarat has also promoted similar types of gangs in
    both the communities, dealing in alcoholic drinks. Similarly, though on
    small scale, a flourishing tribe of the foot-path vendors have come into
    existence. They are also protected (on payment of ‘haptas’) by some
    gangs. Thus a core of well organized gangs is operating in different spheres
    and localities indulging in systematic arson, killing, looting, or
    intensification of violence in the process.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Power politics oriented election strategies is a
    significant political factor that has contributed to deepening the communal
    divide. The sizable Muslim community votes can be a key-factor in capturing
    power in Gujarat. To create a solid vote-bank the Congress strategists
    evolved the popularly known KHAM (Kshatriya, Harijan, Adiwasi, Muslim)
    model. To compete against the Congress and break its politics of vote-bank
    BJP resorted to Hindutva-card, isolating Muslims and winning a large number
    of Hindu community votes.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The prevailing situation in Ahmedabad is significant
    since whatever happens in Ahmedabad may have a contagious effect in other
    parts of Gujarat. The contagious effect is not only due to economic factors,
    socio-cultural factors have added a new dimension to the situation and
    intensified the contagion. It is worth noting that since last decade a
    virulent campaign of Hindutva is carried out and VHP, with its subsidiaries
    like Bajarangdal, Durgavahini etc. has taken hold on Gujarat’s public
    life. Under the patronizing eyes of BJP and the Sangh-Parivar, they have
    almost turned fascist threatening and attacking even secularist and
    rationalists, in the name of preserving ‘Hindu-Culture (!)’. During last
    riot it was seen that they were well informed about minority community as to
    who lived where and who owned a particular shop or business premises, and
    attack them accordingly. This shows that they are organized, their actions
    are planned and they are prepared and supported by the party in power so
    that they could terrorize the people.Godhara incident was just an excuse to
    launch their assault. It is true that the Karsevaks travelling by that train
    had behaved badly and were harassing other passengers, particularly Muslims.
    On Godhara station also their behavior was the same. However, burning the
    whole coach (it is said that the plan was to burn the whole train) and more
    than fifty of its occupants (including ladies and children) spread instant
    horror, anger and hatred throughout Gujarat. A ‘Bandh’ (voluntary
    curfew) was called and observed on the next day. Overnight the VHP and its
    subsidiary groups became active and well organized and planned attacks on
    Muslims and their business premises were carried out. Hundreds of people of
    both the communities (more than 800) have lost their lives, unbelievable
    mayhem and atrocities have been directed against men, women and children,
    thousands of business premises and houses have been ransacked and burned,
    more than fifty thousand people are living in relief camps or with relatives
    and/or friends.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The assaults on the Muslim community were not carried
    out by a few people or small groups but the mobs of thousands of people.
    Actually not mobs, because they were planned attacks by organized and armed
    groups marching like a battalion. Against these odds it was impossible for
    few well meaning people to protect the people of the other community
    residing amongst them. Some Muslims, who had acquired guns, responded to
    these attacks by private firing which infuriated the mob further.</p>
    <p class="subheadline"><b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff">ROLE OF
    GOVERNMENT</span></b></p>
    <p class="paragraph">What was the response and role of the governmental
    machinery to this situation? It seems that BJP ruled government simply
    closed its eye in the initial period. Some ministers were accused of leading
    attacking groups, hindering or directing the police in a specific way. The
    news of the Godhara carnage spread like a fire and massive onslaught was
    mounted against Muslims in urban and even rural areas. The whole Gujarat
    (except Saurashtra region) was engulfed in violence. Members of minority
    communities residing in many villages either fled or were killed and their
    houses and shops demolished. Organized and disciplined groups planned their
    attacks and went from one place to another. Instead of taking stern action
    to protect the innocent people (who had nothing to do with the Godhara
    carnage) BJP and VHP officials went on recounting the horror of Godhara
    carnage and Muslim involvement in it only. It is surprising that the Modi-government
    claims to have controlled the situation. The mayhem has lasted for forty
    five days and yet there is no sign of its abatement. Most parts, including
    the central business area, are under constant curfew and every day there are
    reports from different areas about clashes, stabbing, police firing, etc.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">It is reported that police were rather supporting or
    looked the other way when these attacks were going on. Perhaps the majority
    of Hindus in police forces were sympathetic to the Hindu sentiment which was
    further reinforced by the Godhara incident and directions from some
    ministers; as a result they failed in their duty to maintain law and order
    impartially.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Armed forces were called belatedly to control the
    situation and curfew was clamped in many areas. Even after a month and a
    half many areas are under curfew and civic life is paralyzed, people earning
    their bread by daily work are in pitiable condition. But, it seems that
    certain organized groups are moving from one area to another and keeping the
    fires of violence burning, government seems to take no steps against such
    groups or their leaders who are openly propagating communal hatred and
    advocating violence. On the contrary it seems to be endorsing the violence
    by saying that it is the reaction or retaliation (on innocent people!
    Because they belonged to the Muslim community some of whose members were
    responsible for the Godhara episode?) of the majority due to the Godhara
    carnage.</p>
    <p class="subheadline"><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff"><b>STATE AND
    CIVIC SOCIETY:</b></span></p>
    <p class="subheadline"><b><font color="#800000">COMMUNALISM VERSES SECULAR
    DEMOCRACY</font></b></p>
    <p class="paragraph">Assessment of the action or inaction of the government
    machinery and the near apathy of the civic society during the riot has
    highlighted the problem of their role in the society and their relationship
    with each other. Historically speaking, in a multi-cultured Indian society,
    to build an integrated nation-state it was wise to opt for a secular
    democratic state and society which would support it. However, in reality we
    have failed to build institutions and inculcate the civic-culture as
    prerequisites for its realization. Primarily it is necessary to correctly
    define the concept of a secular society or state. <b>Our interpretation of
    secular as <font color="#000080">SARVADHARMA-SAMABHAV</font>, protecting
    every religion and their diverse mode of belief structure, their separate
    social and civil code, varied customs, mores and faiths, and even education
    system is not conducive in building an integrated national society or human
    identity. Our identity is basically communal and has proved to be an
    obstruction in building a nation-state. <font color="#ff0000">It is clear
    that in interpreting the meaning of the word secular we have disregarded the
    spirit of the enlightenment and renaissance which was instrumental in
    building a modern state and the civic society in the west. </font>It seems
    that we have to interpret the correct meaning of the word secular in our law
    enforcement. The connotation of the word secular should mean negation of all
    religions (<font color="#000080">SARVADHARMA-ABHAV</font>).</b></p>
    <p class="paragraph">The moot question is, if a ruling party is biased
    towards a particular community how it can create a nation in a
    multi-cultural society? It can never favor a democratic system or culture.
    That is to say, when the state itself becomes a protector and promoter of a
    specific culture which is basically exclusionary in its political practice
    and draws its sustenance by constantly constructing ‘the hated other’,
    the logical implications are most frightening in terms of the preservation
    of secular democracy and a state that recognizes the rights of all its
    citizens including minorities.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">In this situation the functioning of any form of
    government is bound to be vitiated. Even a democratic government would
    succumb to fissiparous movements and civic disharmony. The Indian
    constitution provides for a democratic form of government. But without
    proper institutions to support it and the civic culture which could
    safeguard it, our democracy has remained notional or nominal. In this
    situation it could be easily subverted by the communal movements and fascist
    forces. Our political system has fallen prey to the maneuvering of the power
    politics. There are no effective civic organizations to watch over and guide
    the democratic process. Further our civic culture lacks the spirit of the
    democratic way of life. In absence of democratic culture and values
    necessary for the healthy functioning of the democratic system, we have been
    reduced to mobocracy, representatives elected by mobs, driven by faith and
    feelings. To remedy the situation and evolve a democratic culture and
    organizations from the grass root level the movement for empowerment of the
    people is a must. The movement should seek to generate co-operative
    politics, consensus regarding norms of democratic behavior and provide an
    organizational foundation for the functioning of the democracy. Of course,
    in the prevailing ethos it would be necessary to have commissions or
    citizens councils to monitor their functioning and see that they do not
    become capricious or arbitrary and destroy human rights.</p>
    <p class="subheadline"><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff"><b>REMEDY</b></span></p>
    <p class="paragraph">It may be argued that removing the Modi-government,
    giving effective powers to the military may bring the situation under
    control. Also, it is necessary that political parties and leaders and police
    officers who have failed in their duty be punished. To assess the role of
    various groups, parties, administration and police a commission of impartial
    citizens should be appointed and their findings considered as an indictment
    and criminal actions should be taken against those responsible for the
    perpetration of violence. heir findings considered as an indictment and
    criminal actions should be taken against those responsible for the violence
    and But these are short term measures. They must be buttressed by the
    planned action to reverse the process of communalization of political and
    socio-cultural life of the Gujarat. Peace marches and ‘Dharna&quot; to
    awaken common sense may have symbolic value but we must strive to remove the
    basic causes responsible for the communal disharmony. Our action must be
    directed to evolve a policy of de-communalization of the prevailing ethos,
    disband the fascist forces, build the bridges of communication and bring
    about socio-cultural harmony between the communities. It is high time that
    the sensible and enlightened people from both the communities were brought
    together and build institutions which would further their effectiveness.
    Political action to dislodge the BJP government and its allies should be
    supplemented by building citizens’ councils and youth forums (something
    like EKATADAL) which would fight the fascist forces. They could also fill
    the vacuum left by the erosion of the labor unions and the Mahajan-system
    (guilds of the professional classes) in Gujarat.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">For the creation of the positive climate it is
    necessary to take certain actions like common civil code, making religion a
    personal affair and banning all religious demonstrations and processions
    etc., prohibiting any type of special benefits on religious or communal
    grounds e.g. land for place of worship, help for Hajj, special schools,
    charity, etc., to religious organizations. Desegregation of schools and
    residential areas would be ideal but in the initial stages starting
    communication between the youth, joint clubs and cultural activity groups
    may be initiated.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">An ideological campaign to counter the communalist
    propaganda of the VHP and Muslim fundamentalists, etc. should be on our
    agenda. This campaign should emphasize the secular, rational and scientific
    outlook and inculcate humanist values and a common sense of citizenship in
    the people.</p>

    SCENARIO</span></b></p>
    <p class="paragraph">Looking at the factors and forces responsible for the
    riots and every riot becoming more organized, widespread, and use of more
    and more lethal weapons it can be assumed that soon it would take the shape
    of pitched battles, like a civil war. If this scenario continues we would be
    having a situation similar to Palestine or Bosnia where communal strife has
    led to civil war. If we want to save our nation from such a fate a concerted
    economic, political and socio-cultural program should be initiated and
    followed vigorously.</p>
