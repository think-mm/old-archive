  Sentenced to Be Raped </b></font></p>
  <p align="justify">Dear Readers, </p>
  <p align="justify">There is nothing to be stunned about reading this news, 
  though many of us who do not have the slightest idea on what the earth going 
  on in distant place like Meerwala, may feel completely aghast reading how this 
  type of utterly disgraceful event can occur in a world that boast repeatedly 
  of its glorifying civilization. The world is so much anxious in fighting the 
  &quot;terrorists&quot; who spread fear by their grotesque form of violence mostly 
  against the innocent civilians. But there are other more deadly forms of 
  oppressions seemingly going on for centuries, even more, in so many parts of 
  our world, so many innocent women, men and children are suffering and dying 
  everyday from that criminal aggressions and violence and the economic 
  suppressions, even the governments, the law enforcement agencies in those 
  parts of our globe just look the other way. </p>
  <p align="justify">Read the following: </p>
  <p align="justify">&quot;In June 2002, the police say, members of a high-status 
  tribe sexually abused one of Ms. Mukhtaran's brothers and then covered up 
  their crime by falsely accusing him of having an affair with a high-status 
  woman. The village's tribal council determined that the suitable punishment 
  for the supposed affair was for high-status men to rape one of the boy's 
  sisters, so the council sentenced Ms. Mukhtaran to be gang-raped. </p>
  <p align="justify">As members of the high-status tribe danced in joy, four men 
  stripped her naked and took turns raping her. Then they forced her to walk 
  home naked in front of 300 villagers. </p>
  <p align="justify">In Pakistan's conservative Muslim society, Ms. Mukhtaran's 
  duty was now clear: she was supposed to commit suicide. &quot;Just like other 
  women, I initially thought of killing myself,&quot; said Ms. Mukhtaran, now 30. Her 
  older brother, Hezoor Bux, explained: &quot;A girl who has been raped has no 
  honorable place in the village. Nobody respects the girl, or her parents. 
  There's a stigma, and the only way out is suicide.&quot; </p>
  <p align="justify">But instead of killing herself, Ms. Mukhtaran testified 
  against her attackers and propounded the shocking idea that the shame lies in 
  raping, rather than in being raped. The rapists are now on death row, and 
  President Pervez Musharraf presented Ms. Mukhtaran with the equivalent of 
  $8,300 and ordered round-the-clock police protection for her.&quot; </p>
  <p align="justify">But the story does not end there as Nicholas Kristof 
  observed. Mukhtaran used that money to build two schools in her village, one 
  for the boys and one for the girls, she knew that &quot;education is the best way 
  to achieve social change.&quot; And she was absolutely right about that. However, 
  as always the case, when the local media coverage faded, as it happened in 
  Mukhtaran's case, Pervez Musharraf's government started being tardy in their 
  promise of helping this oppressed woman. She had run out of money, she even 
  had to buy food for the police protecting her! </p>
  <p align="justify">&quot;Meanwhile, villagers say that relatives of the rapists are 
  waiting for the police to leave and then will put Ms. Mukhtaran in her place 
  by slaughtering her and her entire family. I walked to the area where the 
  high-status tribesmen live. They denied planning to kill Ms. Mukhtaran, but 
  were unapologetic about her rape.&quot; </p>
  <p align="justify">A lady whose tribe brethren were involved in this 
  despicable crime said with satisfaction, &quot;Mukhtaran is totally 
  disgraced....She has no respect in society...&quot; as if she demanded respect from 
  the world for the gang rape that her tribes folks did! </p>
  <p align="justify">I liked Mr. Kristof's conclusion that is both piercing and 
  moving: </p>
  <p align="justify">&quot;So although I did not find Osama, I did encounter a much 
  more ubiquitous form of evil and terror: a culture, stretching across about 
  half the globe, that chews up women and spits them out. </p>
  <p align="justify">We in the West could help chip away at that oppression, 
  with health and literacy programs and by simply speaking out against it, just 
  as we once stood up against slavery and totalitarianism. But instead of 
  standing beside fighters like Ms. Mukhtaran, we're still sitting on the 
  fence.&quot; </p>
  <p align="justify">How long will the world be sitting on the fence pretending 
  to be fighting &quot;terrorism&quot; while the real terror having the usual bonfire 
  festival among the poorest of the poor, engulfing sanity while quite mockingly 
  giving two thumbs up to world's disingenuous ignorance? </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>Sentenced to Be Raped </b></p>
  <p align="justify"><b>By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF </b></p>
  <p align="justify">EERWALA, Pakistan — I'm still trying to help out President 
  Bush by tracking down Osama bin Laden. After poking through remote parts of 
  Pakistan, asking for a tall Arab with a beard, I can't say I've earned that 
  $25 million reward. </p>
  <p align="justify">But I did come across someone even more extraordinary than 
  Osama. </p>
  <p align="justify">Usually we journalists write about rogues, but Mukhtaran 
  Bibi could not be more altruistic or brave, as the men who gang-raped her 
  discovered. I firmly believe that the central moral challenge of this century, 
  equivalent to the struggles against slavery in the 19th century or against 
  totalitarianism in the 20th, will be to address sex inequality in the third 
  world - and it's the stories of women like Ms. Mukhtaran that convince me this 
  is so. </p>
  <p align="justify">The plight of women in developing countries isn't addressed 
  much in the West, and it certainly isn't a hot topic in the presidential 
  campaign. But it's a life-and-death matter in villages like Meerwala, a 
  12-hour drive southeast from Islamabad. </p>
  <p align="justify">In June 2002, the police say, members of a high-status 
  tribe sexually abused one of Ms. Mukhtaran's brothers and then covered up 
  their crime by falsely accusing him of having an affair with a high-status 
  woman. The village's tribal council determined that the suitable punishment 
  for the supposed affair was for high-status men to rape one of the boy's 
  sisters, so the council sentenced Ms. Mukhtaran to be gang-raped. </p>
  <p align="justify">As members of the high-status tribe danced in joy, four men 
  stripped her naked and took turns raping her. Then they forced her to walk 
  home naked in front of 300 villagers. </p>
  <p align="justify">In Pakistan's conservative Muslim society, Ms. Mukhtaran's 
  duty was now clear: she was supposed to commit suicide. &quot;Just like other 
  women, I initially thought of killing myself,&quot; said Ms. Mukhtaran, now 30. Her 
  older brother, Hezoor Bux, explained: &quot;A girl who has been raped has no 
  honorable place in the village. Nobody respects the girl, or her parents. 
  There's a stigma, and the only way out is suicide.&quot; </p>
  <p align="justify">A girl in the next village was gang-raped a week after Ms. 
  Mukhtaran, and she took the traditional route: she swallowed a bottle of 
  pesticide and dropped dead. </p>
  <p align="justify">But instead of killing herself, Ms. Mukhtaran testified 
  against her attackers and propounded the shocking idea that the shame lies in 
  raping, rather than in being raped. The rapists are now on death row, and 
  President Pervez Musharraf presented Ms. Mukhtaran with the equivalent of 
  $8,300 and ordered round-the-clock police protection for her. </p>
  <p align="justify">Ms. Mukhtaran, who had never gone to school herself, used 
  the money to build one school in the village for girls and another for boys - 
  because, she said, education is the best way to achieve social change. The 
  girls' school is named for her, and she is now studying in its fourth-grade 
  class. </p>
  <p align="justify">&quot;Why should I have spent the money on myself?&quot; she asked, 
  adding, &quot;This way the money is helping all the girls, all the children.&quot; </p>
  <p align="justify">I wish the story ended there. But the Pakistani government 
  has neglected its pledge to pay the schools' operating expenses. &quot;The 
  government made lots of promises, but it hasn't done much,&quot; Ms. Mukhtaran said 
  bluntly. </p>
  <p align="justify">She has had to buy food for the police who protect her, as 
  well as pay some school expenses. So, she said, &quot;I've run out of money.&quot; 
  Unless the schools can raise new funds, they may have to close. </p>
  <p align="justify">Meanwhile, villagers say that relatives of the rapists are 
  waiting for the police to leave and then will put Ms. Mukhtaran in her place 
  by slaughtering her and her entire family. I walked to the area where the 
  high-status tribesmen live. They denied planning to kill Ms. Mukhtaran, but 
  were unapologetic about her rape. </p>
  <p align="justify">&quot;Mukhtaran is totally disgraced,&quot; Taj Bibi, a matriarch in 
  a high-status family, said with satisfaction. &quot;She has no respect in society.&quot;
  </p>
  <p align="justify">So although I did not find Osama, I did encounter a much 
  more ubiquitous form of evil and terror: a culture, stretching across about 
  half the globe, that chews up women and spits them out. </p>
  <p align="justify">We in the West could help chip away at that oppression, 
  with health and literacy programs and by simply speaking out against it, just
