<span lang="EN-US">Roumari (sometimes written as <i>Raumari</i>) is a remote police station (Upazila) under Kurigram 
district in the north Bengal. On its north lies the district of Dhubri across 
the mighty Brahmaputra river and district of Goalpara on the right side of 
Brahmaputra, both the districts lying in the Indian state of Assam. In the east 
lies the range of Garo hills in Meghalaya of Indian state. In between lies a 
vast low land criss-crossing a few small rivers. In the south lies Dewanganj 
Upazila in Jamalpur district, whereas the great Brahmaputra forms the Western 
border or Roumari. Just across the river lies the ‘Bhaoyaia song’ famous <i>
Chilmari</i> river port. The reader, if you are very careful, you will listen 
the poetic song ‘<i><span style="color:#003366">Hakao Gari Chilirmari Bandar, …. 
Oh Garial Bhai, …</span>'</i> in the lyrical murmur sounds of Brahmaputra when 
it is calm. Roumari was once a big char Island in the vast Brahmaputra riverbed, 
say more than 400 years ago. The eastern branch of Brahmaputra forming the 
natural boundary with present Meghalaya dried up gradually as a result of 
changing course of the river forming a vast low land. In the process the 
southern part of the island too, once separated from the eastern Bengal, which 
now forms the Rajibpur police station, joined with Dewanganj Upazila of Jamalpur 
district. The river Gingiram now separates Roumari-Rajibpur from the mainland.

<span lang="EN-US">We arrived at Roumari by a microbus at about 3-30 p.m. on 28<sup>th</sup> 
October 2004 after traveling through Mymensigh, Sherpur, and Shribardi (within 
Sherpur), and Baksiganj (in Dewanganj) covering a distance not less than 400 km, 
and crossing the river Gingiram that separates Roumari from rest of eastern part 
of Bangladesh by shallow engine driven country boat. I left Dhaka at 7-30 am 
with an young journalist friend Shaiful Islam Tapan and a local guide from 
Khedaimari, Janab Khaleque, a dedicated social worker of the locality. The 
condition of road I describe better not. Our Bangladesh Government with his big 
face, high sounding utterances, and sky height talks is busy constructing 
flyovers with millions of taka and wasting crores of taka on so called 
beatification of Dhaka, and planning to introduce magnetic railway system (when 
the conventional railway system has become practically non existent), but he has 
no money to repair inter-district highways, lanes and by lanes within the cities 
including metropolitan cities like Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong and Rajshahi. The 
condition of roads made our distance from Dhaka to Roumari double if not more. 
The distance from Dhaka to Roumari would not be less than 400 km. Anyway we 
reached Roumari tired and exhausted. We were received by the local elites and 
social workers. </span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
<span lang="EN-US">We met in a local C. G. Zaman high school hall with the local 
people organized by local committee of ‘<i>Siskha Andolan Manch</i>’ largely attended 
by school and college teachers, social workers, cultural personalities and local 
elites. We had an exchange of opinions on various aspects of 
educational-cultural-social problems of the locality. The meeting, presided over 
by a senior teacher of the school Mr. Mujibar Rahman, was addressed among others 
Mr. Azizul Haq Master, erstwhile head master of the school and a freedom 
fighter, well known cultural and political personality of the locality Mr. Abdus 
Sabur Faruqui, Advocate Amzad Hosain of Kurigram Judge court, Mr. Abdul Hai, 
lecturer in Chemistry of Roumari Girls’ College, Shri Shubhransu Chakaraborty, a 
well known and very popular socio cultural personality of the 
Kurigram-Chilmari-Roumari. The meeting was followed by a good iftar. We spend 
the night at the newly constructed Upazila rest house.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
<span lang="EN-US">Next morning we proceeded towards are main destiny, 
Khedaimari village, a <i>char</i>-island in the Brahmaputra river, a distance of 20-25 
km we have to cover after crossing Halholiya river, a branch of Brahmaputra. We 
left Roumari around 9 a.m. with a team consisting of 24 persons on 11 
motorbikes. This is the only way to access Khedaimari as river way by country 
boat has been suspended since September. Other alternative is to walk down. I 
was placed on the back of a bike to be driven by an energetic &amp; stout young man. 
He assured me of safe drive and showed me how to hold him, with the assuring 
utterance, ‘Sir hold me tight this way. You are safe in my hand.’ Not that I am 
a novice, but my age and health concerned them. We drove few kilometers north 
through Roumari-Dantbhanga broken metal road (so-called), and then a few 
kilometers west by kachha but relatively smooth road. Finally we arrived at the 
‘Holholyia’ river ghat. We crossed the river with shallow engine driven country 
boat within 10 minutes following a zigzag course. My young driver cautioned me 
that our real journey henceforth began. We drove through paddy fields, some 
times muddy, and riverbanks etc east-west south and north, then finally south. 
There are practically no roads, except some kachha roads here and there. After 
covering about 25 km we arrived at the <i>Khedaimari junior high school</i> at 11-30 
a.m. </span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">The local leaders of the village community with warm 
greetings received us. The local elite arranged a small function in one of the 
class room which in honor of visit. Needless to say, I was not only embarrassed 
but felt very humiliated. We first met with the school committee headed by the 
chairman, Advocate Amzad Hosain of Kurigram Judge court. We discussed the 
problem the schooling was facing. They have chalked out a program to restart the 
school, which was suspended because of flood and economic crisis. I asked them 
how <i><b>Mukto-Mona</b></i> and <i><b>’Sisksha Andolan Manch’</b></i> could cooperate in their 
program. They want us to help them financially not only in the form of some lump 
donation, but a continued support for at least three years. The head master, Mr 
Shaiful Islam Babul handed over a draft budget prepared by the committee to me.</span></font></p>

<span lang="EN-US">The school campus is very beautiful, an ideal place for a 
school. It is located on an open rectangular field of ~ one acre high land 
spread with slightly lengthened north-south. The land was donated by a local 
well to do cultivator family out of love for education. The family set an good 
example for all of us by not giving any condition or attaching any string for 
the donation he made that the school should be named as so and so .. , which our 
ministers, political elites do in their locality. School started with a single 
tin-shade cottage with three or four class rooms having a five-six feet verandah 
erected on the northern side of the field on a mud base one or two feet lower 
compared to the base of the main filed.&nbsp; The cottage stands on narrow concrete 
pillars with bamboo-made fence. A few years back the CARE, an well known NGO, at 
the request of the local leaders of Khedaimari-Roumari-Kurigram, led by Advocate 
Amzad Hosain and others constructed two big flood shelters. When the school was 
established, CARE handed over the two buildings to the school authority 
permanently to be used as school buildings at the request of the school 
committee. Two buildings, identical in construction, erected on heavy concrete 
pillars with tin-shed and fence made of also tin. The school committee made the 
necessary modification to convert the buildings as school buildings. Each 
building has 4 classrooms of 15x15 sq.ft. plus a office; each class room was 
furnished with bench and chairs and black board. In one word, school had all the 
minimum facilities. Unfortunately the local people failed to provide necessary 
financial support to run the school. And flood devastation caused suspension of 
the school activities, though not completely. However many students left it 
because better poor condition of the school.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
<span lang="EN-US">The old school suffered heavily, its tins were blown away, 
although some could be recovered. The bamboo fence completely destroyed and the 
furniture, and the floor heavily damaged, because of kachha base made of mud. 
The other two buildings however did not suffer much loss. There was some damage 
on the tin fence. The main loss however incurred in damage of furniture. They 
need immediately new furniture for the class. The total loss, as estimated by 
the school committee would be around Tk 2 lakhs or so. Some renovation work has 
already been undertaken i.e. necessary repair of the fences of the new buildings 
and some furniture purchased. But they could not yet touch the repair of the old 
school bhaban. A new head master and an assistant teacher have been appointed. 
The school authority stressed that from January 1, 2005 the school would start 
function with full vigor if we stand behind them. I promised to the school 
authority on behalf of <i>Mukto-Mona</i> to provide necessary support to stand

of the function our journalist friend Tapan gave a brief introduction of <i><b>
Mukto-Mona</b></i> with and its humanitarian activities with special emphasis of 
its effort to collect fund for participating in post rehabilitation project 
related to education. He said that members of <i>Mukto-Mona</i> ‘are your sons 
and daughters’. The meeting was addressed by local elites those include Messers 
Alimul Haque, a local leader, Jasimuddin, Head master, Char Shoulmari High 
School, Shaiful Islam, Head master Khedaimari Lower secondary School, Azizul Haq 
Sarkar, Ex Head master, Roumari C. G. Zaman and High school and Shubhranbsu. 
Advocate Amzad Hosain, Chairman of the school committee presided the meeting, 
whereas Janab Abdul Aziz, a member of the school committee, conducted it. In my 
speech I thanked local people and the school committee and expressed my 
gratitude for giving us (the <i>Mukto-Mona</i> and Siksha Andalon Manch) a 
unique opportunity in ‘your effort to reconstruction and revalidation of the 
school’, to participate. I assured them on behalf of the <i>Mukto-Mona</i> that 
we ‘will give you a continued support within our limitation in reconstruction 
and reestablishment of the school.’ I ended my speech with handing over a cheque 
of sum of Tk 100,500/- (Taka One lakh five hundred) only formally to Advocate 
Mr. Amzad Hosain, Chairman of the School Committee on behalf of <i>MUKTO-MONA</i> 
with amidst applause. </span></font></p>

then declared the function closed at 1-30 pm after making his concluding speech

even in dream.</span></font></p>

Khedaimari is a big <i>char</i>, elongated north-south, being divided into three parts, 
the north Khedaimari, the middle Khedaimari and the South Khedaimari. It is 
within the Union of Bandber under Roumari Upazila. The school is located at 
South Khedaimari. The Char is located on the bank of Brahmaputra about 2 km 
away. The River Halholiya separates Khedaimari from main Roumari. After the 
function we went to see the river Brahmaputra. It is a scenic beauty. On the 
bank, vast never ending green paddy fields on one side and the mighty river 
would make you feel here lies ‘Jibanananda’s Bangla’, our motherland.</span></font></p>

returned to Roumari safely at about 3-30 pm retracing the same roads (?) and 
enjoying the same thrilling experience, but not before seeing the Dantbhanga, a 
northern most tip of border with Asam, the place is famous for a special kind of 
semi brown <i>Rosgolla</i>. Surely I bought a few kg for my family, friends and 
relatives- carrying a sweet 
memory (as sweet as the <i>Rosgollas</i>) of visit of Roumari-Khedaimari. </span>
