	<p class="MsoNormal">In
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/flood2004/roumari.html">my 
	previous report after returning from Roumari</a> I briefly stated that in 
	Khedaimari village, a char island in Brahmaputra-Jamuna river with the 
	active cooperation MM a lower secondary school (Class VI-VIII) is being set 
	up. On that occasion on behalf of MM I handed over a sum of Tk. 100,000/- 
	(one hundred thousand taka) to initiate the work (29<sup>th</sup> October, 
	2004). Since then I have been monitoring the progress of the project.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">I arrived Roumari on 7<sup>th</sup> April evening again 
	by a microbus after a long journey of not less ten hours and met the local 
	elites in a meeting in the evening. We exchanged views over many things but 
	mainly on education with special reference to problems being faced by rural 
	institutions. Next morning we proceeded to char Khedaimari&nbsp; to look for 
	ourselves the condition of the school project MM initiated. We reached there 
	after crossing a river, branch of Brahmaputra&nbsp; in about one hour’s journey 
	on motorbikes. The present status of the project is described below in 
	brief. </p>
	<ol type="1">
		<li class="MsoNormal">A school committee has been constituted as per 
		rules. A popular local man Advocate Amzad Hosain, a practicing lawyer in 
		Kurigram district court, heads the committee. Politically he is a 
		liberal democrat believing in secularism and pluralism, as I understand 
		from his conversation with me. Head master is the member secretary. 
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">4 teachers have been appointed including the head 
		master. 
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">The number of students is nearly 200 out of which 
		more than 40% are female. This is a very healthy sign. 
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">The school has officially started functioning from 
		January 1, 2005. In the mean while the educational authority of the 
		government at various levels has visited the school quite a few times. 
		The authority is very much impressed as reported by the President, Head 
		master and other members of the committee. It is hoped that the school 
		would get government recognition within a year or so. In the meanwhile 
		school board authority has given official sanction to continue academic 
		programme of the school. This is very encouraging especially when we 
		take into account of the background of locality- a remote village in the 
		bed of river Brahmaputra, isolated from outside world and civilization.</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font color="#008000"><i>A cultural function 
	organized: </i></font></b> <O></O></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText3">The local people and the school children were 
	overwhelmed with joy and surprise because of our visit. The local people 
	could not imagine that persons like us, in their eyes luminaries of our 
	society would come to them to help establish a school. A grand cultural 
	function was organized on the occasion of our visit. Personally I felt 
	embarrassed but elevated. The function includes:</p>
	<ol type="1">
		<li class="MsoNormal">a musical soirée performed by the school children. 
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">a debate competition participated by the students. 
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">Lathi khela – a grand display of our folk 
		tradition, participated by not less than 50 local lathials. The 
		performance of lathi khela displaying variety of techniques was led by a 
		octagerian old man. After the show I personally talked to him. He once 
		again invited me to come to Khedaimari when he would again display the 
		performance for at least 2 hours. I politely accepted his invitation. 
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">Performance of baul sangit by the real folk bouls. 
		A truly boul-sangit was presented in its true perspectives. It is simply 
		charming. 
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">Jari gan, another institution of our folk culture. 
		Some portion of the epic of Karbala was presented after colorful 
		introduction of seeking blessings from Allah, the prophet, and various 
		gods and goddesses of Hindu mythology including Himalayas. 
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal">Finally, a kabi-gan (a duet song between two 
		poets) was presented for half an hour. Theme of the duet was present 
		chaotic cindition obtaining in our educational world. One singer 
		supporting the stand of the government measures, the other one 
		criticizing it and government’s utter failure. Needless to say, the 
		government-supporting singer ultimately accepted the defeat. </li>
	</ol>
	<p class="MsoNormal">The function began with a mass drill displayed by the 
	students followed by an opening song. No recitation from holy Koran. A half 
	an hour speech giving ceremony was held in which a few local elites spoke. I 
	handed over a sum of Tk 50,000/- (Tk fifty thousand) on behalf of MM, which 
	was applauded by the audience. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">The function, which continued for over 4 hours, was 
	participated by almost entire village population in which female 
	participants outnumbered their male counter parts. And all came without any 
	‘borkha’, a rare scene is to be found in Jamat dominated Bangladesh. I spent 
	almost whole day with the villagers participating in their joyous mood.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">I returned from Khediamari to Roumari at about 9 p.m. 
	dead tired.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Ajoy Roy. </p>
