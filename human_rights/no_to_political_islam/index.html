  <p>This is an appeal to all peace-loving people –– Muslim and non-Muslim
  –– who would extend their helping hand to any effort to uplift humanity,
  liberty, equality, fraternity, and above all, justice anywhere in the world.
  What happened on that dark day of human history, September 11, 2001, which
  shattered world peace and disgraced Islam and Muslims throughout the world, is
  a turning point in world history and the history of Islam. It is high time
  that sensible and civilised Muslims and non-Muslims put their heads together
  to understand the causes of this catastrophic event with a view to defusing
  the unnecessary tension, conflict, mutual hatred and lack of trust and
  understanding between Islam and the West. This is a global and collective
  responsibility of both the Muslims and non-Muslims of the world to take a
  positive step towards preventing more violence, injustice and uncivilised
  behaviour in any name and form, especially in the name of Islam.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sending this message to each and every honest and
  sincere, brave and righteous person to join our movement, “No-to-Political
  Islam”, to strengthen our cause –– bringing peace and justice within and
  outside the amorphous Muslim community. Our prime object being the exposure
  and the eventual eradication of all obscurantist views and beliefs, programmes
  and objectives bearing the prefix of “Islamic”, we believe, should get
  wholehearted support of every civilised human being irrespective of her/his
  faith and nationality. We would most appreciate your lending support to the
  movement to crush the evil of “political Islam” from Indonesia to Morocco,
  and Australia to America and beyond, once for all.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want Islamic scholars (not the so-called Ulama, whose
  knowledge does not go beyond the age-old Fiqh or Muslim jurisprudence, and the
  controversial Hadis literature), both Muslim and non-Muslim, and organisations
  and individuals who promote human rights to support our movement against
  “political Islam” and all the variants of the not-so-divine Shariah law,
  anachronistic to civilisation, common sense and antipodal to the teachings of
  the Holy Prophet.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Now, what do we mean by “political Islam”? Since all our
  activities in power perspective, within a community, society or a club, or
  within a state and beyond at the inter-state level is “political”,
  whatever Muslims do in power perspective within a clan, village or community
  by citing Islam as the source and sanction behind such activities is
  “political Islam”. The persecution of village women in the Salish courts
  in Bangladesh in the name of Shariah or death threats and execution of women
  in the name of Islam in countries like Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia,
  Pakistan and lately, Nigeria, come within the broad definition of the
  expression. And we want the disempowerment of the self-styled custodians of
  Islam, both Ulama and the non-Ulama sections of Muslim leaders, to establish
  the rule of law in accordance with the principles of human rights and common
  sense. We do not want the preponderance of the Ulama (Sunni Islam does not
  recognise any established and formal clergy) and the obsolete Shariah in
  deciding the fate of the Muslim community. We want the preponderance of
  “spiritual Islam” at the cost of the “political” one.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;We know some people justify “political Islam” arguing that Islam
  is a very unique religion. The religion of Islam, as it began in Mecca in 610,
  was transformed into a state with the Hijrat or migration of the Holy Prophet
  from Mecca to Medina, they argue. Some even cite Iqbal and Gandhi as both of
  them believed in the inseparability of religion from politics. They, however,
  ignore the fact that Iqbal’s and Gandhi’s association of religion with
  politics was in the spiritual and ethical sense, rather than in the political
  sense of the expression.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Nothing can be farthest from the truth that the Prophet of Islam ran
  a theocracy, mingling religion with politics. Although his was a unique
  situation, the Prophet being the preacher of a new religion and the head of
  the Medina-based state for about a decade, yet he relied on both the Quran and
  local customs, traditions and consensus of his followers in the day-to-day
  running of the administration. Many Shariah codes are but replication of the
  pre-Islamic rules and traditions. The early caliphs (632-661) also relied on
  local traditions and common sense in running the civil and military
  administration of the state. So, there is hardly anything rigid and
  “Islamic” or divine about the Shariah law as secular, mundane needs and
  traditions moulded the bulk of the Islamic code.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We should not ignore the fact that the Holy Prophet was not only the first
  Arab nationalist –– unifying tribes into a nation –– but also a great
  and successful synthesiser of mundane, secular (pre-Islamic) Arab traditions
  along with the spirituality of Islam. We often forget that the Ummah or polity
  of Islam, as the Prophet conceived of and promoted in Medina, at least in the
  first five years of his rule, had more Jewish and non-Muslim members than the
  Muslim minority. It is wrong to assume that the Prophet promoted and ran a
  theocracy. So, we believe that the mullahs and others who promote an
  “Islamic State” are talking about something, which never existed before.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;For centuries “political Islam” is being sold to unsuspecting
  Muslims as an integral part of the Islamic faith system. But a close look at
  Khomeini- or Taliban-type of states shows that “political Islam” does not
  bring any good to anybody other than promoting the interests of the ruling
  clergy. A monolithic and theocratic Islamic State cannot achieve progress with
  such a dogmatic and unyielding attitude discriminating against non-Muslims and
  others. It is divisive, belligerent and dangerous to humanity. Such an effort
  is bound to backfire endangering the existence of both Islam and its peaceful
  adherents throughout the world.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Since we aim at bridging the gap between Muslims and non-Muslims by
  placing an alternative to militant and obscurantist “political Islam” for
  the sake of peace and justice, we would like to enlighten and educate both
  liberal and militant Muslims and friendly and not-so-friendly non-Muslims
  through a concerted effort of our team. We believe that ignorance breeds
  prejudice and prejudice is the nursery of hate-crimes and terrorism. In
  accordance with Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817-1898), the founder of the Aligarh
  Muslim University in north India, and some of his followers, Chiragh Ali,
  Sayyid Ameer Ali and others who tried to revive the spirit of rationalism,
  secularism and peaceful co-existence with non-Muslims among Indian Muslims in
  the 19th century, we are also going to bridge the gap between ignorance and
  knowledge eventually to bring the East and West closer to each other for the
  sake of global peace and progress.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We firmly believe that the so-called tide of “Islamic fundamentalism”
  is a passing phase and a part of the growing pain and birth pang of progress.
  But we should not underestimate its baneful effects on the Muslims and the
  world at large. The bulk of the backward Muslim community throughout the world
  has been experiencing an unfair deal at the hands of their rulers and their
  overseas patrons. The colonial legacy of exploitation and misrule is still
  felt almost everywhere in the Muslim world. Even people in the prosperous but
  abysmally backward Arab world are not free from such exploitation in the name
  of Islam and patriotism/nationalism. A similar passing phase was witnessed in
  the 12th and 13th centuries in parts of modern Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. The
  “Old Man of the Mountain”, Hassan bin Saba, ran a large gang of
  hashish-smoking killers (hence the term “assassin”) belonging to the
  Ismaili sect of Shiites who indiscriminately killed Sunni Muslims and others
  with impunity until their suppression by Halagu Khan in 1258. This would be
  too trite an assumption that Ismailis are synonymous with terrorists, as we
  know how peaceful and civil are members of this relatively prosperous Shiite
  sect, wherever they live as traders and professionals.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently through our movement, we are trying to
  establish that Islam per se is not the problem or threat to world peace and
  progress. Some misguided Muslims under equally or more misguided leaders,
  motivated by “political Islam” for various socio-economic and political
  reasons are the problem. As one can no longer portray the Ismilis as
  “Assassins”, so eventually one would not associate Islam with terrorism
  provided we liberate the religion and its followers from the clutches of
  “political Islam”. We want Western support and cooperation in this regard.
  As the Western media and intellectuals distinguish Hitler and Nazism from
  Germany and Christianity for the sake of objectivity, our movement aims at
  bringing about similar objectivity between Islam and terrorism. Like Buddha,
  we believe that: “Not by hate is hate destroyed, but by love alone is hate
  destroyed.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Our movement is going to educate Muslims and others about how Muslim
  vainglory and neglect for philosophy, mathematics, rationalism, science and
  technology since the 11th century has been catastrophic to the community. We
  must know that the builders of the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort and the Ottoman
  conquerors of Europe did not establish a single university (the Ottomans
  established one as late as 1879). Consequently most Muslims have remained
  pre-modern, pre-capitalist nourishing medieval, feudal and tribal traditions
  and culture. Since Islam has not gone through its Reformation and Muslims have
  not staged their Renaissance to revive the lost glory of the early Abbasid era
  (before the ascendancy of Mutawakkil the Bigot as the Caliph), half-educated
  mullahs reign supreme everywhere from Indonesia to Morocco in the Muslim world
  and elsewhere among the Muslim Diaspora in the West. Our movement is a step
  towards Muslim Renaissance and Reformation of Islam.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ummah needs a thorough home cleaning and soul
  searching. And this cannot be achieved without the support of Muslim and
  non-Muslim human rights groups, intellectuals, legal experts, historians,
  anthropologists, philosophers, scientists and others who want liberal, secular
  laws and institutions for everyone, everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Please feel free to contact me giving your feed back, telling us what you
  can do for the promotion of our cause:”No-to-Political Islam”. Quite a few
  enlightened Muslim and non-Muslim scholars and human rights organisations have
  already lent support to our movement. We want organisational support and team
  work with human rights activists, development agencies, feminist organisations,
  NGOs, media and academia throughout the world to fight “political Islam. We
  need your support and cooperation, now.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>No-to-Political Islam: further elaborations</b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been overwhelmed by very positive response from so many
  people from Australia, Singapore, Bangladesh, Britain, India, Pakistan, US,
  Canada and elsewhere that it is not possible to acknowledge them all
  personally. However, I thank them all on behalf of my colleagues and partners
  in the movement against “poltical Islam.” I am also appreciative of those
  friends and well-wishers who have mild to serious disagreement with our
  programme.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before shedding more light on our programme and modus
  operandi, I would like to make a few observations and comments on some of the
  comments and querries of the readers.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in full agreement with those who think that
  “political Islam” is anachronistic to Islam and that it is a new
  phenomenon, not older than the beginning of Western imperialism. Muslim
  empires and kingdoms remained secular and the not-so-organised Ulama had
  hardly any role in the running of the state machinery other than giving
  counsel to government officials and rulers in the form of Fatwas or legal
  opinions, if and when solicited by the latter. Muslim kingdoms were much more
  secular than their European counterparts who had to listen to the organised
  Christian clergy, especially the Pope in the Catholic world. Most importantly,
  the concept of an “Islamic State” is alien to Islam and early Muslims. The
  two most frequently used expressions to denote the Muslim community,”Millat”
  and “Umma”, do not correspond to “Nation” or “Polity” rather they
  transcend these concepts to mean universal brotherhood and global Muslim
  community.</p>
  <p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the view that there is no “Islamic
  system” of running the government, there are only Islamic values and ethics.
  And while the Quran is sacrosanct and the Muslims are supposed to believe in
  its divine origin as part of their faith or Iman, there is no such obligation
  on part of them to accept the Hadis literature and Fiqh (Sayings/traditions of
  the Prophet and Muslim jurisprudence developed in the 8th-10th centuries). One
  does NOT cease to be a Muslim by renouncing those Hadises which contradict the
  Quran, science, common sense … Fiqh cannot be anything permanent for all
  ages. No Imam Hanifa, Hanbal, Shafi or Malik has any right to take away the
  right of Ijtihad or reasoning to formulate new laws and principles according
  to the exigencies of time. So, no Shariah law is that divine or sacred that
  Muslims cannot raise questions about it, eventually to abrogate the law, if it
  goes against the Islamic principles of peace and justice. These concepts are
  universal.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, by no stretch of the imagination, want to revive the
  Abbasid era. We only admire the spirit of rationalism and tolerance which
  developed under the early Abbasids. And figuratively, we want the revival of
  the Early Abbasid era, as we also want the revival of the spirit of enquiry
  and rationalism as developed by the Mutazilites, Qaramatians, Sufis and even
  the Kharijites. In short, we want to replace the dogmatism and intolerance of
  Maududi-Hasan Banna-Syed Qutb along with the intolerance and fanaticism of the
  Taliban and Iranian brand of Islam with liberalism and secular laws and
  institutions throughout the Muslim world. We want the preponderance of
  secular, liberal tradition both in the public and private domains. We are
  opposed to all forms of violence, including stoning to death for adultery and
  female genital mutilation, exclusion of women from the public life and forcing
  them to wear Hijab (let alone the barbaric Burqa), as the Quran does not
  sanction these barbaric pre-Islamic customs and institutions.</p>
  <p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some commentators have rightly observed that Islam is not
  the only backward religion and promoter of violence. And that the West,
  especially America, played an important role in promoting “Islamic
  terrorist” groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-i-Islami,
  Taliban, Hamas and many other clandestine groups during the Cold War. We are
  aware of this fact. But we need to clean our house first, especially in the
  wake of the Nine/Eleven. No sensible Muslim can condone what a tiny faction
  among Muslim militants have been doing by killing unarmed and innocent
  civilians as such acts are in contravention of the Quran and sayings of the
  Prophet. We most definitely are not strengthening Western imperialists at the
  cost of the Muslim world. On the contrary, we want to save both Muslim and
  non-Muslim victims of “politicval Islam”. In fact, most victims of Islamic
  fanaticism have been Muslims, in Muslim majority countries.</p>
  <p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to elaborate our programme and modus operandi, I would
  like to clarify first that we are NOT launching a political movement against
  “political Islam” in the traditional sense of the expression. Ours is a
  cultural movement to motivate Muslim intellectuals, lawmakers, politicians and
  members of the civil society to speak up against those Mullahs who justify
  violence in the name of Islam and justify subjugation of women, minorities and
  other weaker sections of society in the name of Islam. We will eventually
  reach Muslim lawmakers, lawyers and civil society through our publications,
  seminars, conferences and the media.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to approach like-minded NGOs and members of the
  civil society in the Muslim world. We will eventually publish our literature
  in various other languages, including Arabic, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Persian
  and Indonesian. We are also contacting the media and various political and
  cultural organisations in various countries to circulate our message.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also going to educate the average Western
  intellectual, politician, students and the common people who want to work for
  global peace and justice. We will eventually bridge the gap between the West
  and Islam. We do not believe that either of the two can live in peace by
  giving fillip to the concept of the “clash of civilisations”.</p>
  <p><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome constructive suggestions from both Muslims (both
  practicing and non-practicing) and non-Muslims. But ours is not a forum for
  useless polemical discourse. We do not want to be confrontational, but we will
  remain steadfast and firm in our determination to establish the truth for the
  sake of justice and global peace. People working against all forms of
  religious extremism (Hindu, Christian, Jewish and others), gender activists,
  development practitioners, lawyers, teachers, journalists, students, human
  rights activists and social workers are most welcome to join our movement.</p>

      launching a signature-campaign “No To Political Islam” by a team of
      Partner-Organizations of Muslim and non-Muslims from the platform of one
      of the highly reputed humanist organizations of the world, as the “Host-Partner”
      of the campaign. At the moment, some notable Islami Scholars and
      Institutions are working for it as well.</p>
      <p>For centuries Political Islam has been sold to unsuspecting Muslims as
      an integral part of the Islamic faith system. But a close look into it
      shows that Political Islam does not reflect the humanity, justice and
      equality that Islam preaches. It strives to establish a monolithic
      theocratic Islamic State. No nation, community or state can achieve
      progress with such a dogmatic and unyielding attitude that seeks to impose
      its will on all of humanity, creating division and enmity among the
      peoples of the world. Such an effort is bound to encourage aggressive
      attempts from the proponents of other religions. The propagation of “Hindutva”
      in India and the Ten Commandments engraved in the granite-statue erected
      in front of Alabama judicial building already reflect such an attempt.
      Similar possibility remains with “Halakha”, the codified Jewish Law in
      Israel.</p>
      <p>While non-political Islam has a tremendous wealth to present humankind,
      Muslims must do much better than Political Islam to establish their
      rights, to prosper, to conduct liberation-wars (as Bangladeshis, with some
      75% Muslims of the population, fought and won liberation war in 1971 –
      the word “Islamic Jihad” was never used) and to resist some
      Western-government’s arrogances for its geo-political interest. The
      effort of creating Islami-State cripples the development of Muslims and
      holds them restless, suspicious and aggressive. Muslims cannot afford to
      carry this liability anymore. This effort in the past was a human endeavor
      in their own circumstances. But now we know the importance of living
      together without conflict and we must progressively develop our present
      legal system and its application through secular democracy complying with
      the fairness, justice and equality that all religions including Islam
      preach.</p>
      <p>This is no idle dream. Recently Muslims made much greater progress
      under secular democracies of North America, Europe and Australia than they
      did in absence of such system elsewhere. In fact many Muslim scholars are
      of the opinion that, while no system is perfect, in its true sense, God’s
      Law has largely been more or less established in these countries, if by
      that term one means justice and humanity. Muslims have been allowed to
      migrate in huge numbers without any overpowering racism, their
      institutions have exploded in number, they are able to assert their legal
      rights and they have been able to observe Islamic way of life without any
      hindrance. After living and prospering under secular democracy, many
      Muslims now realize that this planet is not theirs alone, that they have
      to share it with others in honor and equity, and not impose their will on
      others.</p>
      <p>As the Prophet (SA) established and led the nascent Muslim community in
      Medina, it is possible to get misled and mislead people by the notion that
      his mission was to establish both Islam and Islamic State. But the Qura’an
      proves it otherwise in such clear words for all Prophets including
      Muhammad (SA) that there is no scope of human-argument, (For Muhammad (SA)
      see Sura Al Qahf 29 and 56, Sura Yunus 108, Sura Al Gashiyah 21 and 22, Al
      Anam 48 and 107, Al Ahzab 45 and 48, Sura Al Mayedah 92 and 99 and
      specially in Sura Muhammad 9. For other Prophets: -Al Araf-62, 63, 67
      &amp; 68, 79, and 93.) Development of Medinian nascent administration was
      entirely and absolutely circumstantial. Had there been no resistance from
      his tribe in preaching there would have been no such development.
      According to many Muslim scholars, in many cases political Islam directly
      contradicts the Qura’an and the Sunnah. So it is highly embarrassing
      primarily to Muslims because of its denial to basic human rights including
      denial of women’s and non-Muslims eyewitness and legitimate rights in
      certain cases, and denial of non-Muslim’s natural right to lead or
      defend his/her own motherland.</p>
      <p>This campaign is not about reforming Islam or Muslims. As Political
      Islam effects everybody, it is a peaceful joint effort by non-political
      people of all faith to liberate Islam from its political stronghold. As in
      today’s dynamic pluralistic world people of every faith are moving to
      and living all over the world, we firmly believe that abandoning Political
      Islam is the first step we can take to strengthen communal harmony and to
      ensure peaceful co-existence of all faiths on our planet.</p>
      <p>Different Partner-organizations of this campaign do have different
      reasons/opinions to act for the common goal of rejecting Political Islam.
      Any effort to reconcile all the different reasons/opinions is difficult if
      not impossible. So their own different reasons/opinions will be separately
      linked to the dedicated website, which is almost complete. Translating the
      campaign material in different languages is going on, and will be linked
      to the Front page.</p>
      <p>We are no politicians, police, military or State-machine. All we can do
      is to create public-awareness and a pressure-group. Once a rich
      signature-tank is developed, we will proceed to influence all the
      Governments, International Organizations and medias of the world including
      the UN and European Parliament, where our Host-Partner currently has its
      permanent member-representations.</p>
      <p>We are at the end part of the long preparation. Please consider your
      organization joining the team of Partner-organizations and spread this
      call.</p>

      <br>
      As I was reading the piece titled &quot;Building the Partner-Team - No to
      Political Islam&quot; by Fatemolla, I was surprised to see him referring
      to Mohammad with &quot;SA.&quot; I thought people like Mr. Fatemolla
      certainly would not believe that a prophet would need well wishes and
      salutes every time he is referred to. I had a hard time believing
      everything that was written in that article coming from Mr. </font></font><font face="arial,helvetica" lang="0" size="2" family="SANSSERIF">fatemolla</font><font lang="0" face="Arial" size="2" family="SANSSERIF">.
      Of course, when I reached the end of the article, I saw his nickname and
      the name of Dr. Taj Hashmi. Now, that made some sense.<br>
      <br>
      However, I do agree with Dr. Mohammad Omar Farooq, ex-Muslims are not
      supposed to be in the business of talking about how to follow Islam. Mr.
      Mahmud should stick to his point, <b>&quot;But after learning what Islam
      stands for, we had no choice but to leave it. After becoming familiar with
      the Quran, the choice became clear: it is either Islam or it is humanity.

      Being a non-Muslim, I do appreciate the somewhat sensible talk of Dr.
      Hashmi. Some progress is better than no progress.<br>
      <br>
      I would, however, like to challenge Dr. Hashmi with some specific
      questions on &quot;No to Political Islam.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Should the constitution of Bangladesh retain &quot;Bismillahi Rahmanur
      Rahim?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Should Islam remain the so-called &quot;State Religion&quot; of
      Bangladesh?<br>
      <br>
      Should the political party of Awami League use &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; as
      a party motto?<br>
      <br>
      Should the political party of BNP use &quot;Bismillahi Rahmanur Rahim&quot;
      as a party motto?<br>

      I would say, you can not call yourself an ex-Muslim and try to reform an
      Islamic mind at the same time. However, assuming that Muslims are also
      humans with some common sense, they are certainly not beyond the scope of
      ex-Muslims and non-Muslims. The point is, <font color="#ff0000"><b>I would

      Islam&quot; -- Please Respond</font></p>
      <p>Fatemolla &amp; Taj Hashmi Bhais,</p>
      <p>I have been following your campaign &quot;No to Political Islam&quot;
      for a while. I have been wondering whether I should join in. But a few
      questions do remain in my mind. First thing that comes to my mind is
      &quot;saying yes to your campaign&quot; may (if at all) be good for this
      world but it comes at the cost of own 'sense of honesty'. Saying 'no to
      political Islam' is tantamount to saying 'no' to Prophet Mohammad (SA)
      himself (don't go to Koran now). He was the political head of entire early
      Islamic domain, he was setting rules and regulations and he was collecting
      revenues and running the state machinery. And he never gave any
      instructions to his followers to abandon control- key of the state after
      his demise. Nor there is any suggestion from Mohammad (SA) and in Koran
      that Muslims should run state-machinary in alliance with Islam-outsiders.
      I mean to say, I didn't see any non-Muslim as being part of state during
      Mohammad's and his early caliphets' reign of power. And with the little knowledge
      I have of Koran, I didn't see any such suggestion being made even in 'blurr
      terms'. Instead the instruction for the opposite scenario is quite in
      abundance. Under such circumstance, I wonder if I join your campaign, I'm
      only putting my life on the line by denying the truth of Islam. I do value
      my life.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, your 'campaign-note' contains multiple statements-
      assessments very disrespectful of Islam. I quote a few:</p>
      <p>&quot;The effort of creating Islami-State cripples the development of
      Muslims....&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;As the Prophet (SA) established and led the nascent Muslim
      community in Medina, it is possible to get misled and mislead people by
      the notion that his mission was to establish both Islam and Islamic State.
      But the Qura'an proves it otherwise in such clear words for all Prophets
      including Muhammad (SA) that there is no scope of human-argument....&quot;</p>
      <p>This statement is utter contradiction to the truth about Islam. The
      truth of the matter is in reality, the migration of Prophet Mohammad (SA)
      to MEdina was the first step towards making an Islamic state. Prophet
      Mohammad, in truth, exterminate all non-Muslims (which include pagan,
      Christians and Jews) systematically and in carefully planned steps from
      Medina and regions around. Furthermore, once that was established, there
      he got the launching-pad for taking up Mecca followed by destroying and
      cleaning-up of all religious objects, symbols and Institutions of the
      pagans there. This is a naked truth and every Muslim knows that well.
      Isn't it a truth that by our 'glaring lies' through this campaign is only
      going to make us a 'laughing-stock' to a billion good Muslim brothers? Of
      course, no need to mention the life-threatening ire we are bound to
      attract..</p>
      <p>&quot;Development of Medinian nascent administration was entirely and
      absolutely circumstantial. Had there been no resistance from his tribe in
      preaching there would have been no such development.&quot;</p>
      <p>This statement doesn't hold any water. In Medina, the Muslim mahajirs
      never faced any serious and threatening opposition from the Pagans and
      Jews-Christains. There isn't any indication of that. They only didn't
      believe in 'Mohammad and Allah' and they may have lauched a vocal campaign
      about the veracity of Prophet Mohammad's (SA) claim of enlightenment. And
      that was good enough reason to cruelly extirpate them from their homes and
      lands to establish what 'you call nascent Medinian state'. It's again
      lying knowingly.</p>

        The call for &quot;No to Political Islam&quot; was supposed to be made a
        long time ago. Even though it's late but yet it's never late to do a
        right thing For this, I appreciate Dr. Taj Hashmi for taking the
        responsibility for making this call. I also appreciate Mr. Fatemolla for
        realizing the need for preventing the implementation of cruel Sharia
        laws by the political islamists. In fact, in all his writings, he
        highlighted the ill effects of politicizing Islam by the political
        Islamists. Now taking the lead, Dr. Hashmi has really done a good job
        not only for the secularists but also for the &quot;peaceful
        Muslims.&quot; The secularists living in the Muslim countries always
        wanted to ban Islamic politics. The Bangalees of Bangladesh learned the
        lessons of Islamic politics in 1971. Almost all the Islamic political
        parties used &quot;Islam&quot; to justify the killings of Bangalees who
        were fighting for independence against the Pakistani Muslim brothers of
        the political Islamists. Bangladesh banned these Islamic political
        parties in the aftermath of our independence. But, they came back to the
        politics within a short time by the support of their patrons. Gradually
        they influenced to change the secular nature of the constitution to pave
        the way for bringing cruel sharia/blasphemy laws to protect political
        Islamic activities.
      </div>
      <div>
      </div>
      <div>
        Once political Islamists come to power, they start implementing sharia/blasphemy
        laws. In many cases, the Muslims themselves become the victims. The
        Muslims aren't a homogeneous group. They're divided into Shiites,
        Sunnis, Quadianis, etc. The blasphemy and cruel sharia laws can go
        against many of these groups. The society becomes intolerant. There're
        many examples of killings among Shiites, Sunnis, and Quadianis. All
        these killings and tensions in a country under Islamic rule generally
        give a bad image of Islam as a religion despite the slogan &quot;Islam -
        a Religion of Peace&quot; by the Islamists. So, it's time for the
        Islamists to see how they can take the political Islam away from
        politics so that the cruel/barbaric sharia laws can't be implemented in
        a modern world.<br>
        <br>
        The humanity has suffered in the hands of the political Islamists for a
        long time. Using political Islam and the cruel laws of Sharia, Talibans
        tortured/killed women, secular individuals, and people of other
        faith/belief. Using political Islam, they created a society full of
        hate/torture/killing. Given the opportunity, the Jamat-I-Islami and
        similar parties will use &quot;Political Islam&quot; to justify
        establishing barbaric sharia laws in Bangladesh. The humanity should be
        freed from the influence of the &quot;Political Islam.&quot; In fact,
        there won't be any conflict with the peaceful followers of Islam. A
        pluralistic society based on the separation of religion and state
        ensures the rights of all religion including &quot;Islam.&quot; That's
        why, Muslims living in the western countries are free to practice their
        religion Islam. I observed that many Muslims appreciate the western
        policy of the &quot;separation of state and religion.&quot; But,
        unfortunately, many of them are insensitive to the rise of the political
        Islamic parties such as Jamat-I-Islami (the party that took part in
        genocidal crimes against Bangalees in 1971 alongside killer Pakistani
        forces) in Bangladesh. They don't give strong support to the
        &quot;separation of religion and state&quot; in the country of their
        origin, which are dominated by majority Muslims and some of these
        countries are ruled by the primitive barbaric sharia laws.

        The Islamists never bothered to protect Islam from the clutches of the
        Political Islamists. Whenever the secularists raise their voice against
        political Islam, they were labeled as Murtads (apostates) or enemies of
        Islam. The political Islamists were able to suppress the voices of
        secular humanists in the Muslim countries by the power of their patrons,
        by the power of money (petrodollars), and by using the influence of
        their religion on the illiterate/hapless Muslims. It's true that the
        illiterate and poor Muslims are huge in numbers. The well-educated
        silent groups of the liberal Muslims weren't very vocal against the use
        of Islam for establishing age-old and primitive Sharia laws by the
        political Islamists. Now is the time for the practicing Muslims,
        non-practicing Muslims, apostates, and secular humanists to join the
        movement for saying &quot;No to Political Islam.&quot; The welcoming
        message by Dr. Taj Hashmi to all these groups irrespective of their
        religious belief is encouraging. I thank him for his broad and open
        welcoming message to all to join the movement for &quot;No to Political
        Islam.&quot;
