	<font face="sans-serif" size="5"><b>Bangladesh: Young boy among six killed 
	in electricity protests</b></font> <br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">The Bangladeshi government must immediately 
	set up an independent investigation into the killings of farmers protesting 
	electricity shortages in the northern town of Kansat, said Amnesty 
	International today. Six more deaths were reported overnight as police 
	clashed with farmers.</font> <br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">Ten-year-old Anwar and 63-year-old Abdur 
	Rahman, a teacher, were among those killed by police yesterday as up to 
	12,000 people took to the streets, according to local officials. People at 
	the scene said police fired live ammunition with AK47s, rubber bullets and 
	tear gas to dispel the crowd, which responded with sticks and machetes. 
	Local news reported around 300 people were injured, including nearly 20 
	police officers. </font><br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">&quot;At least twenty people have been killed in 
	these electricity protests since January,&quot; said Abbas Faiz, South Asia 
	researcher at Amnesty International. &quot;There must be an impartial 
	investigation into these deaths and anyone found responsible for illegal 
	killing should be brought to justice without delay. Any police officers 
	suspected of shooting civilians should be removed from active service 
	pending investigation.&quot;</font> <br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">According to local news reports, police 
	also vandalised and looted houses in a number of villages, beat up villagers 
	and arrested dozens of people. The reports also said that police prevented 
	journalists going near the scene, and threatened them with a gun when they 
	asked for the names of victims.</font> <br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">There are severe shortages in the supply of 
	electricity and fuel to the area, affecting the pumps that farmers use to 
	irrigate their crops. The resulting lack of water is seriously threatening 
	the current rice crop and farmers' livelihoods. Local people fear food 
	shortages in the coming year. </font><br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">It is the responsibility of governments to 
	ensure people have the necessary means to prevent the destruction of their 
	livelihood.</font> <br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The authorities must ensure the means for 
	farmers to grow their food and maintain their livelihoods,&quot; said Abbas Faiz. 
	&quot;A regular supply of electricity is urgently needed for irrigation to 
	prevent the destruction of the current paddy crop, on which these farmers 
	depend for their survival.&quot;</font> <br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">Most of those protesting are electricity 
	customers who pay the government-owned Rural Electrification Board for 
	supplies they say they do not receive. Farmers report not receiving 
	electricity for days, and then when they do get a supply it is only for a 
	maximum of four to five hours. Farmers are demanding that electricity 
	supplies be continuous, and that they should pay only for the electricity 
	that they actually receive.</font> <br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">Background</font> <br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">On 4 January 2006 two men were killed and 
	50 received bullet wounds when police opened fire at demonstrators in Kansat, 
	Chapainawabganj district. The killings triggered further protests. On 23 
	January 2006 seven people were killed and more than 100 injured by police 
	firing at demonstrators. A 12-year-old boy died the following day from his 
	injuries. </font><br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">On 5 April 2006 at least four people were 
	killed when local Bangladeshi Nationalist Party members mounted bomb attacks 
	on the farmers' rally. </font><br>
	<br>
	<font face="sans-serif" size="2">The Bangladesh Bar Council's Human Rights 
	Committee feared police would resort to arresting large numbers of people 
	and filed a public interest litigation before the High Court. On 10 April 
	the High Court ruled that none of the protesting farmers should be arrested 
	or harassed except in compliance with the law. It also gave the government 
	three weeks to explain why the killings on 4 and 23 January should not be 
	considered unlawful; why compensation should not be paid to the bereaved 
	families; and why the authorities should not be directed to provide 
	electricity to the area for a specified period.</font> <br>

	is an Internet forum and a human rights organization of predominantly 
	secular Bangalee origin whose goal is to promote rational thinking and 
	upholding human rights in Bangladesh and rest of the world. We have been 
	alarmed by the carnage in Kansat, Chapai Nawabganj, perpetrated by police. 
	Our solidarity is with the villagers who are protesting in the street to lay 
	claim to their rights of receiving electricity. The government of Khaleda 
	Zia did not bother to listen to villagers’ complaint for months. Instead of 
	settling the dispute peacefully, the government decided to take a harsh 
	measure that resulted in the death of 20 unarmed persons. The villagers told 
	the newsmen that there were several midnight raids in scattered villages 
	near Kansat. Many affected people are leaving their homesteads to get away 
	from police and BNP goons dressed like police (as reported by villagers to 
	news reporters). We protest the scorched-earth policy of the government. 
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh Government should not turn Bangladesh into a police state. We 
	fear that if disputes are not settled peacefully, violence may flare up not 
	only in Kansat but in adjoining areas. There are resentments everywhere in 
	the nation over escalating food prices, corruption, fundamentalism, 
	terrorism, poverty 
	and many other burning issues. One simply has to read daily newspapers being 
	published in Bangladesh to realize the gravity of the worsening situation of 
	our motherland. Recently, a 
	lot of brutality by the police and other law enforcers in this country has 
	been observed so far, but nothing can be comparable to the mindless killing that 
	has been going on at Kansat during the last four months. According to the newspaper report, 
	two were killed on 
	January 4 followed by killing of seven on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of the same 
	month. Then again four were killed on April 6 and another was injured, who 
	later died on April 12. Finally, six were killed on 12<sup>th</sup> of the 
	same month. So, in total of 20 innocent villagers lost their invaluable 
	lives for the 'crime' of just demanding adequate electricity supply to carry on 
	their farming. In addition to the mindless killing, there have also been rampant attacks on the their houses and 
	their properties are being subjected to damage and looting by the brutal 
	police force. The happenings at Kansat indeed should boggle&nbsp; conscious 
	peoples' mind. This is a shame for gunning down unarmed people and looting 
	their properties who were agitating for electricity supply. We condemn such 
	police brutality at Kansat and&nbsp; our plea to Bangladesh government is to&nbsp; 
	send immediately a committee of retired judges to investigate the alarming 
	situation. We also demand exemplary punishment of the policemen responsible 
	for the killings. Also, the families who lost their loved one should be 
	compensated financially. Please stop this uncalled for violence perpetrated 
	by police. Please bring a closure to public protests for their legitimate 
	demand before violence grip the entire nation. The government should not be 
	repressive in democracy. Please be mindful of this before another shot is 
	fired at the protesters.</font></p>
