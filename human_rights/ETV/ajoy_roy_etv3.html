    <p align="justify"><font size="2">ETV started its Terrestrial transmission
    from 14<sup>th</sup> April (Bangla Navabarsa), 2000 as a non-government TV
    channel. It soon became popular for its neat, neutral and free from
    government control objective presentation. But it did not show anti
    government attitude either. It was critical of government actions where it
    was necessary- as a free and independent media must do. It also praised
    government actions where it should be. Latest example is issue of banning
    polythine shopping bag- the channel praised the zealous actions of the
    environment minister. The transmission was a great relief for those viewers,
    specially of rural areas and low income group people who got tired of
    hearing the monotony of tales of achievements of the government and its
    ministers including the Begum Saheba propagated by the channel known as BTV.
    Its low standard of cultural presentation including drama and magazines, one
    sided views of discussions conducted and presented by a set of so called
    intellectuals who sold their intellect to their master i.e. Begum Saheba
    irritated general viewers and most of them switched over to ETV as they
    cannot afford to expensive dish channels.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">Our judiciary could not rather did not
    feel nor appreciate this finer aspect of the issue. We only lamented and
    could not prevent the course of action. We lost our battle on the cultural
    and intellectual front; we lost on the legal front also.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">Because of the rejection of the review
    petition by the supreme court appellate division on 29<sup>th</sup> August,
    2002 its transmission came to an end after 2 years 4 months and 15 days. The
    end was unceremonious and abrupt. The death of ETV was never expected nor
    desired by the common mass, intellectuals and general intelligent viewers
    except some uncultured slaves like pro-government elements about whose
    intellectual level I have serious doubt.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    </font><b><font face="Arial" color="#800080">
    <p align="justify">Who filed the writ petition and why ?</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    </font></b><font face="Arial">
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">Let us begin from the beginning. After
    completing the agreement between the government and the Ekushe Television on
    9<sup>th</sup> March, the license was allowed to hand over to Ekushe
    Television Limited. Ekushe Television came to air on 1<sup>st</sup> Baisakh,
    1407 BS (14<sup>th</sup> April 2000) coinciding with our new years day.
    After the caretaker government came to power (15<sup>th</sup> July, 2001)
    three persons in the public interest filed a writ petition (in September
    2001) against ETV on the charge that gross irregularities was committed in
    giving the ETV broadcasting license with terrestrial facilities from BTV
    free of cost. The petition pointed out that as a result of extending
    terrestrial facilities free of cost the government has been incurring a loss
    of Tk 60 lakh per year.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">Who are those great guys came forward to
    safe guard the public interest after more than year of transmission of ETV ?
    Were they sleeping during AL government when the agreement was signed and
    license was issued ?</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    </font><i><font face="Arial" color="#800080">
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">It is quite obvious that the move was
    political and politically motivated. The main issue before them was not the
    public interest - the issue before them was to defame ETV and end its
    activity, which according to their assessment were not conducive to their
    election victory.</font></font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
    <font face="Arial">
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">Antecedents and past activities of these
    petitioners amply prove it. They are Prof. Choudhury Mahmud Hasan of
    department of pharmacy, Dhaka University, Prof. Md. Abdur Rob of department
    of geography, Dhaka University and journalist Gias Kamal Choudhury. Needless
    to say all these three persons are well known political supporters of
    BNP-Jamat axis- all of them are direct and indirect beneficiaries of BNP
    government in the past. Mr. Rob and Mr. Hasan are active workers of Jamat i
    Islami and top leaders of the pro BNP-Jamat group known as Sada Dal in Dhaka
    university teaching community. Mr. Mahmud Hasan was appointed chairman of
    Bangladesh medicine and drugs control board by the government during the
    tenure of Begum Khaleda her first term. Mr. Abdur Rob got promotion during
    the same time. Role of great journalist Gias Kamal serving the cause of BNP
    is too well known to elaborate. He is an out and out BNP man. I do not know
    the English equivalent of the Bengali word 'chamcha'? That is the
    appropriate word one should put on the shoulder of Gias Kamal as a
    decorative badge. Who does not know the benefits he derived from Khaleda
    government in nineties and still deriving? Who does not know his appointment
    as press counselor in UK ?</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">On 26<sup>th</sup> September the high
    court issued a rule to ETV that till the case is disposed off terrestrial
    broadcasting must be kept suspended by the ETV. The high court however gave
    permission to continue transmission on the condition that ETV should submit
    an appeal. Ii is strange that before making any preliminary hearing the HC
    issued such an order !</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    </font><b><u><font face="Arial" color="#800080">
    <p align="justify">Has the HC verdict really protected the Public Interest
    or destroyed it ?</p>
    </font></u></b><font face="Arial">
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">On 27<sup>th</sup> March the learned high
    court gave its epoch making verdict that killed not only a fine institution
    but killed feelings of millions of weeping Bengalis who got accustomed with
    ETV broadcasting for the last two years. To these weeping millions ETV
    provided an window to see a bigger world that lies outside the geographical
    limit of Bangladesh and deeper insight of our own beloved Bangladesh- its
    people, its land and enriched culture. ETV freed them from the clutches,
    torture and chain of government controlled BTV channel.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The high court did not take note of the feelings of these
    people although this is case dealing with public interest. The high court
    only took notice of interest of only three persons and the government
    interest as it was incurring so called loss of 60 lakh taka per year; but in
    looking after the interest of those persons, self proclaimed guardian of the
    public interest and perhaps the government interest it never occurred to the
    learned members of the bench that their verdict might kill interest of
    millions of Bangladeshi, the values and conception of a neutral,
    control-free television channel. Hundred dollar question is has their
    verdict really safe guarded any sort of public interest, or their devoid of
    human touch action destroyed the very root of public interest. Would the
    learned justices constituting the high court bench ever think over it</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">of their far-reaching verdict? Would they
    think at their leisure time: has it done good to the society or strengthen
    the hand of tyranny.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <b><font face="Arial" color="#800080">
    <p align="justify">Reaction</p>
    </font></b><font face="Arial" color="#800080">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </font>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">Immediately after the rejection of the
    review petition by the appellate division of the supreme court the attorney
    general remarked that Ekushe Television, after the pronouncement of the
    judgement, has no valid or legal basis for transmitting television programs
    through their channel. They have no valid license- either terrestrial or
    satellite. The attorney general advised the Ekushe TV to show respect to law
    and should stop their transmission immediately. The lawyer appearing for the
    three infamous writ petitioners as expected reiterated what the attorney
    journal said. This shows that the claim made by attorney general that the
    government is not a party in the issue is not true. Government is very much
    in collusion with the writ petitioners. This is the reason why attorney
    general did not defend the decision of the government though he should have
    been as continuity of governance demands. This is an indication that
    government is not clean. It wished the death of the ETV as its later work
    proved beyond doubt.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">ETV's lawyer Barrister Rafiqul Haque
    however differed with the observations of the attorney general. As ETV has
    already applied for a fresh license with the Bangladesh Telecommunication
    Regulatory commission, till the body takes its decision the ETV can continue
    their transmission without violating any legal aspect. He further commented
    that high court had declared license of ETV invalid but it did not declare
    action of ETV in handing over the license to Ekushe ETV limited invalid or
    illegal. According to the BTRC (Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory
    Commission) act the Ekushe Television Limited got the power of broadcasting
    TV programme till 31<sup>st</sup> January, 2003. Barrister Ishtiak Ahmed and
    Dr Kamal Hosain more or less agreed with the contention of Barrister Rafiqul
    Haque.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">Today (30. 08. 02) barrister Kamal Hosain
    elaborated his points regarding continuing transmission of ETV programme. He
    pointed out that no where in the verdict of appellate division of the
    supreme court it has been mentioned that broadcasting of ETV would be
    stopped. The verdict of the bench did not direct the government to close
    down ETV forcibly. If any one utters such thing it is totally wrong. The ETV
    has already applied for license according to Bangladesh Telecommunication
    Act 2001. The regulatory commission would decide the issue independently,
    the verdict of the appellate division in no way should have impact or
    influence on their decision or disqualify the ETV obtaining the license. Dr
    Hosain further commented that for the interest of democracy, we need a
    government control free independent TV channel. In developing the process of
    democracy the contribution of ETV has been recognized. Before the
    establishment of ETV the electronic media was and still is functioning with
    government controlled directives. The learned lawyer drew our attention that
    the high court has declared ETV license ineffective and illegal but the
    license of Ekushe Television Limited has not been declared nether invalid or
    illegal. The supreme court appellate division has clearly said &quot;<i><font face="Arial" color="#800080">The
    counsel for the Ekushe TV Limited has submitted that it has filed an
    application with regard to TV license with the Telecommunication Regulating
    Commission, established under the Bangladesh Telecommunication Act, 2001.
    Our judgement will have no bearing in considering the application by Ekushe
    for license by the said commission which is free to decide in accordance
    with law.</font></i>&quot;</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">The information minister in his reaction
    reflected the opinion of the government, which is quite antipathetic to ETV
    cause. In an interview with BBC the 'red-eyed' (physically appeared so)
    minister commented that the terrestrial as well satellite license both are
    declared invalid by the court verdict. He further said that once ETV has
    become illegal <u>no license could be issued in the same name</u>. After the
    court verdict, the government has no intention to continuing programme of
    Ekushe TV channel, the minister continued. In answer to a question he said
    that if any one apply for license in future '<font face="Arial" color="#800080">we
    would consider the application on legal basis</font>'.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">These contradictory comments by the
    minister showed total lack of basic understanding of laws. On the one hand
    he is uttering that he would consider the application for license according
    to law, at the same moment he gave the verdict '<u> no license could be
    issued in the same name'</u>. This attitude of a senior minister reflects
    the opinion of the government of Khaleda Begum indicating the intention of
    total annihilation of Ekushe TV channel.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">The law minister Maudud Ahmed in an
    interview with a BTV correspondent said that Ekushe TV channel has no legal
    basis to continue after the supreme court verdict. If they continue to
    broadcast even on satellite it will be a risky step. The message is clear
    that government is not going to tolerate it. To the eye of the government
    such action on the part of the Ekushe would be treated as illegal. So
    government made it quite clear what action it would take if ETV continues
    its transmission even via satellite communication.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">The erstwhile state-minister of
    information during AL government expressed his reaction by saying that
    ministry of information gave approval to ETV its broadcasting facilities-
    but for some strange reason this ministry was not made a party. He alleged
    that the government suppressed papers on which validity and legality of
    issuing license to ETV could have been proved beyond doubt. If the
    government produced all the papers the situation would have been different.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <b><u><font face="Arial" color="#800080">
    <p align="justify">Is the License issued to ETV illegal and invalid ?</p>
    </font></u></b>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">The verdict of HC says so. This has been
    upheld by the supreme court. But the lawyer of ETV Barrister Rafiqul Haque
    argued otherwise. He pointed out that there was no dearth of transparency in
    the procedure that was followed to issue license to ETV. The technical
    evaluation committee headed by the then BTV chief engineer Mr. Anisur Rahman
    gave a satisfactory report. But during high court hearing of the writ
    petition Mr. Rahman absented himself on the health ground although he later
    on submitted an affidavit. However the license was not issued only on the
    basis of the technical report. All the rules and formalities were observed.
    A summary was prepared and submitted to the then prime minister to which the
    PM gave approval. The approval of the investing board was taken. The license
    was obtained according to the Bangladesh telecommunication Act. So there
    were no lack of transparency on the part of the Ekushe TV.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font size="2">Barrister Kamal Hosain also opined in the same way. In a
    press statement he stated that a fresh challenge on the part of the attorney
    general on the matter of issuing license to ETV has created a new issue. The
    writ petition by three persons in the name of public interest was filed in
    September 2001 during the caretaker </font><font color="#000000" size="2">government
    of Justice Latifur Rahman. The office of the attorney general, on behalf of
    the caretaker government, informed the high court bench all matters relating
    to ETV license is legal and valid. In it, it was stated that all the
    formalities regarding opening of a non-government TV channel had been
    completed in a legal procedure. All the relevant and related matters were
    discussed several times in relevant ministries including finance, interior,
    defense, post and telecommunication and board of revenue. The entire matter
    covering all these aspects in a summarized form was presented before the
    then PM for approval. Thus all the formalities necessary for running a
    non-government TV channel was observed. A report dealing with all these
    matter was submitted to the high court division bench. During the hearing in
    the high court the government of Khaleda Begum did not submit any affidavit
    contradicting the report submitted during the caretaker government. The
    attorney general now has no scope of challenging the issue of giving license
    to ETV.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <b><u><font face="Arial" color="#800080">
    <p align="justify">The last moment of ETV broadcasting</font></u></b></font><b><u><font color="#800080" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
    </u></b><font color="#000000" size="2">
    <p align="justify">As the verdict of the appellate division of the supreme
    court is pronounced on 29<sup>th</sup> August at 11-40 am, the government
    immediately moved on with unimaginable speed to stop transmission of ETV
    immediately. To the eye of the government ETV is an illegal TV channel - so
    any transmission terrestrial or satellite must be treated as illegal. Hence
    government is out to stop illegal activities of ETV. The Begum Saheba
    immediately summoned the information minister Tariqul Islam and attorney
    general A F Hasan. After being briefed She asked them to take immediate
    steps to stop transmission of ETV channel forthwith.</p>
    <p align="justify">Following the directives of Begum Saheba the information
    ministry started moving quickly without wasting any more time. The BTV
    director general rang ETV's chief programmer Mr. Nowajesh Ali asking him to
    stop ETV's terrestrial broadcasting immediately which Mr. Ali declined.
    Immediately afterwards BTV switched of the electronic system of terrestrial
    network. Thus the programme of ETV's terrestrial came to an abrupt end in
    the afternoon. Following the decision of the ETV management led by Simon
    Dring resumed satellite transmission from 7 p.m. evening. This enraged the
    government. Immediately two offices from CID arrived at the Jahangir tower,
    head office of the ETV and asked to close down transmission otherwise they
    would forcibly do it. The two officers again visited the tower at 9 p.m.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">With unprecedented speed the government sealed six
    terrestrial centres of transmission of ETV at Rampura, Chattagram, Sylhet,
    Khulna, Nator and Rangpur after delinking terrestrial microwave linking of
    ETV. The ETV has been asked to dismantle their towers and VHF equipment.
    This has put ETV authority in a very difficult situation as it is time
    consuming; they need place and space for preservation and more over these
    equipment for which the authority has spent millions of taka are of no use
    except in terrestrial transmission.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Following this threat and fearing the brutal police action that might
    lead to destruction of valuable equipment and life as well, the ETV
    authority decided, after consulting with their attorneys, to close down
    transmission. During this melee the officials from the Telecommunication
    Regulatory Commission brought in some papers showing government -decision
    canceling all license of ETV. This is the final and severe blow to the ETV
    from Begum Saheba's government. This is the way the so called autonomous and
    independent bodies and commissions in our state work and enjoy their
    autonomy under Begum Saheba's governance.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">The government hurriedly removed the last legal basis of
    ETV. So there is no other alternative but to stop transmission on the part
    of the Ekushe Television. Hurriedly the programme organizer prepared a final
    announcement telling its viewers that ETV is closing down but with hope that
    soon they will come afresh. The announcement call itself 'Ekti Bishesh
    Ghosana' (a special announcement). At that time, nearing 11 p.m. a drama
    serial based on novelist Showkat Ali's 'Abashese Prapat' was being
    transmitted.</p>

    at 5 p.m. the government took all steps with a view to stopping all
    activities of Ekushe Television - permission to use BTV tower and its space
    was cancelled and the microwave linking facilities and all frequencies
    needed for transmission given to ETV were withdrawn.</p>

        government we are governed by?</font>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <u>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">The Court Verdicts</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    </u>
    <p align="justify"><font size="2">I have profound respect to our legal
    system including the justices and lawyers. And I sincerely hope my comments
    would not be treated as tantamount to contempt of court.</font></p>
    <ul>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;
      <li><font size="2">The high court has given its verdict in the public
        interest. Which section of this public the three petitioners represent ?
        Yes the HC verdict has protected the interest of those three elite, but
        in giving the verdict have the learned justices took into account of the
        interest of millions of common mass for whom ETV was a window to outside
        world, a developed world- vast and varigated?</font>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <li><font size="2">The question is why the learned bench of HC did not
        take serious note of the affidavit submitted by the office of the
        attorney general on behalf of the caretaker government which stated
        categorically that the license issued to ETV was given through legal
        procedure following all lawful formalities.</font>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <li><font size="2">Why the ministry of information, which piloted the
        entire mechanism, was not made party to the writ case? Why the then
        secretary of information was not asked to the hearing?</font>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">Where had the file dealing with relevant matters of
    license in the information ministry gone? Why attempts were not made to
    recover the file? Why chief engineer of BTV whose evaluation report was one
    of the key elements in giving license to ETV was not asked to appear before
    the HC bench?</font></p>
    <ul>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;
      <li><font size="2">Why the HC acted as an investigating burro? The HC
        verdict stated that the license given to ETV was obtained through
        fraudulent procedure. But why the verdict did not point out or identify
        who were involved in it and how was it accomplished? Can the learned
        bench issue such a far reaching verdict that would affect not only an
        institution that has invested 750 millions of taka and provided jobs to
        over hundreds of young and talented persons and earned reputation as an
        independent neutral and objective television media that was not know in
        this part of the world but also affect interest of millions of viewers,
        on incomplete documents and on the basis of assumed forgery.</font>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <li><font size="2">Why the highest courts of the country including the
        appellate division of the supreme court acted so mechanically. Why they
        applied the laws devoid of human feelings and human touch. Why they
        would not consider the far reaching consequence of a verdict that they
        are going to pronounce would impact the society and its members for the
        welfare of whom all laws are made? Are the laws above human feelings and
        humanism?</font>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <li><font size="2">Let us assume an illegal child under a fake parent hood
        became a renowned man with lot of talents and contributed a lot to the
        society - when it is discovered that his birth procedure is illegal
        would the law of the country kill him? Assuming that the license to ETV
        has been acquired through illegal method for this can the highest courts
        kill ETV an illegal child in the view of the guardians of our legal
        system?</font>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
      <li><font size="2">My final question is directed to the guardians of our
        legal and judiciary system. The government is an institution so also is
        the judiciary and both are continuum- with change of individuals like
        PMs or Chief justices are their continuity lost ? Or does the previous
        decisions or verdicts become invalid ? If the decision is a good one and
        has delivered good to the society, but arrived at in a, say not too
        transparent way, detected later on would the law(s) kill the decision
        that has proved beneficial or try to redress or rectify the flaw of the
        procedure ?</font>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">Let me give another example. Say one BNP MP in the
    interest of public filed a case pointing out that the design, place of
    construction, estimated cost, and construction of the Bangabandhu Jamuna
    Setu involved malpractice and whole procedure was completed on the basis of
    fraud and forgery- and our courts found true of his allegation. Will the
    highest court instruct to demolish the bridge ? And as soon as the court
    pronounced its verdict would our government send its ministers and cadres to
    rush to the Jamuna setu and start demolishing it as the bridge had been
    erected with illegal method by a previous government?</font></font></p>
