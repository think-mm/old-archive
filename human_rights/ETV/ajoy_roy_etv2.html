    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The full bench of the appellate
    division of the supreme court constituted of Chief Justice Mainur Reza
    Choudhury, Justice Md. Rahul Amin, Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim, Justice K
    M Hasan, Justice Sayed J R Modassir Hosain, Justice Abu Sayeed Ahmad, and
    Justice Md. Fazlul Haque heard for last six days from 24-29<sup>th</sup>

    </u>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">Barrister Rafiqul Haque appeared for ETV and took part in
    the deliberation. Barrister Haque argued that if there were any
    irregularities in obtaining the license the High court could have sent the
    matter to the T&amp;T Regulation commission for settlement, instead
    Barrister Haque contended that the High court acted as an inquisitive
    journalist and as an enquiry commission which was not the responsibility of
    the High court. He further said that the same wrong procedure was followed
    in the verdict of the appellate division. If the verdict of the appellate
    division were read coolly the learned review petition would be ashamed off.
    When inquired by the Chief justice which parts of the verdict were of such
    nature the Barrister Haque remained silent. On the other hand the chief
    justice informed Mr. Haque that they would feel ashamed if they knew the way
    the license was acquired.</p>

    </u>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">Barrister Haque resumed his arguments this morning saying
    that if anything wrong had been done in this matter why the ETV should be
    punished for the fault or irregularities they did not do. He informed the
    court that the then Prime minister approved the proposal relating to
    license. The brief summary of the proposal was prepared by the ministry of
    information and was placed before the Prime minister. Prime minister.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <u>
    <p align="justify">26. 08. 02 -27. 08. 02</p>
    </u>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today (26. 08. 02) Dr. Kamal Hosain
    appeared before the court on behalf of two foreign investors and continued
    his arguments on the following day (27. 08. 02). He informed the bench that
    after one year of establishment of the ETV, the investors invested their
    capital- now why after three years this could not be continued he failed to
    understand. Why these companies would have too suffer he raised the
    question. He further added if there were any irregularities in issuing
    license the real culprits should be brought to justice. The bench can issue
    such directives, which would save the life of ETV. The investment board gave
    their verdict in favour of Ekushe TV and all the ministries honoured the
    decision. For this reason the foreign investors came forward to invest their
    capital. Now after three years the question of irregularities is raised. The
    justice must be done to all and equally. He pointed out that for the sake of
    justice the review petition should be considered very seriously. It may be
    recalled that out of the total investment of City Corp International is 40%.
    The bench however pointed out that in review hearing there is no scope of
    hearing of the case in details. Once again he drew the attention of the
    bench that in a democratic country an independent publicity medium is
    essential. ETV is an independent non-government channel. Since its inception
    it has been broadcasting neutral opinions, news and our national culture
    free from government control- we cannot deny its contribution in expressing
    freedom of opinion, thought and speech. If ETV is closed down the public
    would be deprived off such news free of government control. For this reason
    in this review interest of all concerned must be looked upon by the bench.
    It is also the obligation of the bench to save ETV from its death for the
    sake of neutrality and freedom of expression that is the basis of our
    democracy. Advocate Asaduzzaman and Ziaul Haque ably assisted Dr. Kamal
    Hosain.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barrister Ishtiaq Ahmed appeared for
    the chairman of the Ekushe Television limited. Drwaing the attention of the
    bench he argued that according to the constitution the appellate division
    can act on its own to invoke its power. There is no limit to this power.
    Nether the Parliament nor the supreme court has put any control through any
    law(s). Since the constitution has given the appellate division such power
    if it wants to employ such power in this case there is no such bar. For the
    sake of justice the appellate division can apply such power to save the life
    of Ekushe television. He further pointed out that the verdict given by the
    appellate division without allowing 'live' is against the natural justice.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barrister Ahmed argued that the
    irregularities pointed out by the High court in giving its verdict goes
    against the government. The writ petitioners have not cited any single
    instance of irregularities. Who were responsible for those irregularities-
    have not identified in the verdict of the high court. It was obligatory on
    the part of the petitioners to prove those allegations of irregularities,
    but this was not done. The learned judges of the high court gave their
    verdict on incomplete documents of proof and guided by their own suspicion.
    Example of such verdict could not be found anywhere.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barrister Ahmed in his arguments
    appealed to the bench that the Ekushe Television wants justice from the
    bench- not any sympathy. He said that the Mr. A S Mahmud got the license as
    Owner of the ETV on behalf of his establishment. What was wrong in it- the
    learned lawyer inquired. Mr. Mahmud is a law abiding citizen, he pays
    regular income taxes. What is his fault? He said that he is very happy to be
    associated in this case for public interest. He drew the attention of the
    bench to the fact that verdict of the high court is not flawless. It said
    that the license was issued through some irregular procedures- but was not
    mentioned who were responsible for it, who did these irregularities - the
    minister. state minister, secretary, DG of the BTV, or the prime minister ?
    So in his opinion the verdict is incomplete.</p>

    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    </u>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barrister Ahmed resuming his hearing
    argued that <font color="#000000" size="2">that </font>the supreme court has
    its own power which the court can invoke in allowing the review petition of
    the Ekushe Television. He pointed out to the bench that public in general
    wants the continued life of ETV.</p>
    <u>

    <p align="justify">Arguments for writ Petitioners</p>
    </u>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawyer Mr. Abdur Razzak appeared for
    his clients i.e. three writ petitioners. He did not argue much except saying
    that there is no scope for reviewing the case as the live to appeal had been
    turned down by the supreme court appellate division on 2<sup>nd</sup> July.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attorney general A F Hasan told
    the bench that the government is not a party in this hearing. It is under
    pressure from two sides the petitioners and the ETV. One side is blaming the
    government for issuing license of broadcasting to ETV with terrestrial
    facilities and the other side blaming the government for giving license in
    irregular ways.</p>
