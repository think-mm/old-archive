<p><strong><font color="firebrick">A recent essay by Edward Said on the
Palestine issue here. A short biography of Edward Said from <em>The Nation</em>:</font></strong></p>
<p>Edward W. Said, the University Professor of English and Comparative
Literature at Columbia University, is the magazine's classical music critic as
well as a contributing writer. Known both for his groundbreaking research in the
field of comparative literature and his incisive political commentary, Said is
one of the most prominent intellectuals in the United States today. His writing
regularly appears in the <i>Guardian </i>of London, <i>Le Monde Diplomatique </i>and
the Arab-language daily <i>al-Hayat</i>, printed in every Arab capital in the
world.</p>
<p>In 1948, Said and his family were dispossessed from Palestine and settled in
Cairo. He came to the United States to attend college and has lived in New York
for many years. Because of his advocacy for Palestinian self-determination and
his membership in the Palestine National Council, Said was not allowed to visit
Palestine until several years ago.</p>
<p>Educated at Princeton and Harvard, Said has lectured at more than 150
universities and colleges in the United States, Canada and Europe. His writing,
translated into 14 languages, includes 10 books, among them, <i>Orientalism </i>(Pantheon,
1978), a runner-up in criticism for the National Book Critics Circle Award; <i>The
World, the Text and the Critic </i>(Harvard, 1983); <i>Blaming the Victims </i>(Verso,
1988) and <i>Culture and Imperialism </i>(Knopf, 1993). His most recent book, <i>Peace
and Its Discontents: Essays on Palestine in the Middle East Peace Process</i>,
was published by Vintage in 1995.</p>

television images on Al-Jazeera have been burningly clear. There is a kind of
Palestinian heroism in evidence there that makes this the story of our time. An
entire army, navy, and air force supplied munificently and unconditionally by
the United States have been wreaking destruction on the 18 per cent of the West
Bank and 60 per cent of Gaza afforded Palestinians after ten years of
negotiations with Israel and the US.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Palestinian hospitals, schools, refugee camps and
civilian residences have been at the receiving end of a merciless, criminal
assault by Israeli troops huddled inside their helicopter gun-ships, F-16's and
Merkavas, and still the poorly armed resistance fighters take on this
preposterously more powerful force undaunted and unyielding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In the US, CNN and newspapers like The New York Times
fail, to their discredit, to ever mention that &quot;the violence&quot; is
uneven and that there aren't two sides involved here, but only one state turning
all its great power against a stateless, repeatedly refugeed, and dispossessed
people, bereft of arms and real leadership, with the aim of destroying this
people, &quot;dealing them a terrible blow&quot; as the war criminal who leads
Israel shamelessly put it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">As an index of how deranged Sharon has become, I might
quote here what he said to Ha'aretz on 5 March: &quot;The PA is behind the
terror, it's all terror. Arafat is behind the terror. Our pressure is aimed at
ending the terror. Don't expect Arafat to act against the terror. We have to
cause them heavy casualties and then they'll know they can't keep using terror
and win political achievements.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Besides symptomatically revealing the workings of an
obsessed mind bent on destruction and sheer, unadulterated hatred, Sharon's
words indicate the failures of reason and criticism loosed on the world since
last September. Yes, there was a terrorist outrage, but there's more to the
world than terror. There is politics, and struggle, and history, and injustice,
and resistance and yes, state terror as well. With scarcely a peep from the
American professorate or intelligentsia, we have all succumbed to the
promiscuous misuse of language and sense, by which everything we don't like has
become terror and what we do is pure and simple good -- fighting terror, no
matter how much wealth, and lives, and destruction is involved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Swept away are all the Enlightenment precepts by which
we attempt to educate our students and our-fellow citizens, replaced by a
disproportionate orgy of vindictiveness and self-righteous wrath of the kind
that only the wealthy and the powerful, it would seem, have the right to use and
act upon. No wonder then that a fourth-rate thug like Sharon feels entitled (by
emulation and derivation) to do what he does when in the greatest democracy on
earth, laws, constitutional rights, writs of habeas corpus and reason itself are
consigned to the rubbish bin in the pursuit of terror and terrorism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">As educators and as citizens, we have failed in our
mission by allowing ourselves to be bamboozled in this way, without so much as
an organised public discussion about a defence budget that has shot up to $400
billion while 40 million people remain without health insurance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Israelis, Arabs and Americans are told that love of
country requires such expenditures and such destruction because a good cause is
at stake. Nonsense. What is at stake are material interests that keep rulers in
power, corporations making profits, people in a state of manufactured consent,
just so long as they don't get up one morning and start to think about where, in
this mad technologised rush to bomb and kill, we are going.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Israel is now waging a war against civilians, pure and
simple, although you will never hear it put that way in the US. This is a racist
war, and in its strategy and tactics, a colonial one as well. People are being
killed and made to suffer disproportionately because they are not Jews. What an
irony!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Yet CNN never refers to &quot;occupied&quot; territories
(always rather to &quot;violence in Israel&quot; as if the main battlefields are
the concert halls and cafes of Tel Aviv and not in fact the ghettoes and
besieged refugee camps of Palestine that have already been surrounded by 150
illegal Israeli settlements). For the past ten years, the great fraud of Oslo
was foisted on the world by the US, with hardly an awareness that only 18 per
cent of the West Bank were given up, and 60 per cent of Gaza. No one knows
geography and it's better not to know, since the reality on the ground is so
astonishing, considering the verbal hoopla and self-congratulation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">And that pseudo-pundit -- the insufferably conceited
Thomas Friedman -- still has the gall to say that &quot;Arab TV&quot; shows
one-sided pictures, as if &quot;Arab TV&quot; should be showing things from
Israel's point-of-view the way CNN does, with &quot;Mid-East violence&quot; the
catch-all word for the ethnic cleansing that Israel is wreaking on the
Palestinians in their ghettoes and camps. Has Friedman (or CNN for that matter)
ever tried to point out the difference between an attacking army fighting a
colonial war on the territory of the people it has occupied for 35 years, and
the people defending themselves against that butchery? Of course not, for indeed
why should Friedman ever bother to say honestly that there is no Palestinian
occupation, there are no Palestinian F-16's, no Apache helicopters, no gunboats,
no Merkava tanks, in short, no Palestinian occupation of Israel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">So much for Friedman's credentials as an honest
commentator and reporter who has utterly failed, in unadorned terms, to explain
the US view or to understand the Arab and Palestinian cause. Can he not see that
he and his writings are part of the problem, that in their maundering
self-justifications and the dishonesty in which he shows no sign of the self-
criticism he keeps hectoringly expecting of others, he actually aggravates the
ignorance and the misperceptions rather than reducing them? Poor journalist and
educator, he.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The picture you get here is that Israelis are battling
for their lives instead of for their settlements and military bases on the
occupied lands of Palestine. No maps have been run for months in the American
media. On 8 March, hitherto the bloodiest day for Palestinians of the 16-month
Intifada, CNN's main evening news specified the death of 40 &quot;people&quot;
and failed even to mention the death of several Red Crescent workers killed
while their ambulances were prevented by Israeli tanks from getting to the
wounded. Just &quot;people,&quot; and no pictures of the hell they've been
living in this the 35th year of military occupation. Tul Karm is undergoing a
siege of sieges with 24 hour curfews, electricity and water cut-off, systematic
round-ups and the removal of 800 young men, the wanton smashing of refugee
houses, wholesale destruction of property (and I'm not speaking of nightclubs or
sports facilities but of shacks and lean-tos that furnished twice displaced
refugees with hovels for bare subsistence) and limitless cases of sadistic
cruelty to unarmed and undefended civilians who are pushed and beaten and left
to bleed to death, women allowed to give birth to stillborn babies while they
wait needlessly at Israeli road-blocks, old men made to strip and take off their
shoes and walk barefoot for a gum-chewing 18-year-old waving around an M-16 that
my taxes have paid for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Bethlehem, its town center and university destroyed,
flattened at 5,000 feet by valiant Israeli bombers swooshing in with their
marvelous F-16's which I've paid for too. Balata camp, Aida and Dheheisheh and
Azza Camps, the tiny villages of Khadr and Husam, all battered into rubble
without even a mention by the US press, whose New York editors so obviously have
no problems with it, with a few exceptions here and there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The uncounted dead and wounded, the unburied and
unassisted, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands of lives maimed,
distorted, catastrophically marked by wantonly caused suffering, all of it
ordered at a safe distance from the action in leafy, calm West Jerusalem by men
for whom the West Bank and Gaza are distant rat holes filled with insects and
rodents that must be &quot;subdued&quot; and driven out, taught a lesson in the
accepted jargon of Israel's superb military.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">On Tuesday, in the biggest attack of all, Ramallah has
been invaded and is being ravaged by 140 Israeli tanks, thus completing Israel's
re-conquest of the already-occupied Palestinian territories.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The Palestinian people are paying the heavy, heavy
unconscionable price of Oslo, which after 10 years of negotiating left them with
bits of land lacking coherence and continuity, security institutions designed to
assure their subservience to Israel, and a life that impoverished them so that
the Jewish state could thrive and prosper.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In vain during those 10 years did some of us warn that
the distance between the US-Israeli language of peace and the appalling
realities on the ground was never bridged, never even intended to be bridged.
Words and phrases like &quot;peace process&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot; took
hold without reference to any real referent. Land confiscations were either
overlooked or referred to as &quot;bilateral negotiations&quot; that were taking
place between a state consolidating its hold on territory it wanted at all
costs, and a mediocre set of uninformed negotiators whom it took four years to
acquire, much less use, a reliable map of the land they were negotiating over.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The worst misrepresentation of all is that in the 54
years since 1948, never has a narrative of Palestinian heroism and suffering
been allowed to emerge. We are all depicted as violent fanatic extremists who
are little more than the terrorists that George Bush and his cabal have imposed
on the consciousness of a stunned and systematically misinformed population,
aided and uncritically abetted by an entire army of commentators and media stars
-- the Blitzers, Zahns, Lehrers, Rathers, Brokaws, Russerts, and their ilk. The
Israeli lobby is scarcely needed with such faithful disciples trailing happily
in its ranks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">But now that the Saudi peace proposal has become the
point of discussion and of hope, it is necessary, I think, to put it in its
real, as opposed to its supposed, context. First of all, this is the re-cycled
Reagan plan of 1982, the Fahd Plan of 1983, the Madrid plan of 1991, and so on:
in other words, it follows a series of plans many times put forward which in the
end both Israel and the US have not only refused to implement, but have actively
torpedoed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The way I see it, the only negotiations worth having
should be on the phases of a total Israeli withdrawal and not, as was the case
with Oslo, bargaining over what pieces of land Israel was willing very
grudgingly to give up. There's been too much Palestinian blood spilled, too much
Israeli contempt and racist violence dispensed for any serious return to
Oslo-style negotiations brokered by that most biased of honest brokers, the
United States. Everyone is aware, however, that the old Palestinian negotiators
haven't given up on their dreams and illusions, and that meetings have been
occurring throughout the raids and bombings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">But I would argue that due weight be given to decades of
Palestinian suffering and the real human costs of Israel's destructive policies
before any negotiations accord undue status to Israeli governments that have
trampled on Palestinian rights the way they have demolished our houses and
killed our people. Any Arab-Israeli negotiations that do not factor in history
-- and for this task a team of historians, economists, and geographers with a
conscience are needed -- are not worth having, just as Palestinians must now
elect a new set of negotiators and representatives in the hope of salvaging
something from the present calamity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In short, in whatever meetings that now occur between
Israeli and Palestinian representatives, the gravity of Israeli depredations
against our people has to be given attention and not simply brushed aside as so
much past history. Oslo, in effect, pardoned the occupation, excusing it for all
the buildings and lives destroyed over the first 25 years of occupation. After
so much further suffering, Israel cannot be excused and allowed to walk away
from the table with not even a rhetorical demand that it needs to atone for what
it did.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">I will be told that politics is about what is possible,
not about what is desired, and that we should be grateful to get even a small
Israeli pullback. I disagree strongly. Negotiations can only be about when the
total withdrawal will take place, not what percentage Israel is willing to
concede. A conqueror and a vandal cannot concede anything: he must simply return
what he's taken and pay for the abuses that are his responsibility to bear, just
as Saddam Hussein should and did pay for his occupation of Kuwait.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">We are still a considerable distance from that goal,
although in the meantime the extraordinary unbowed bravery of all Palestinians
in Gaza and the West Bank has in effect politically and morally defeated Sharon,
who will lose his seat in the not too distant future. But, that in two decades
his armies can invade Arab cities at will, killing and sowing destruction
without so much as a collective Arab peep speaks reams for the Arab world's
leaders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Lastly, what the various Arab rulers who are so
delicately silent now while Palestine is being raped on TV think they are doing,
I don't know, but I can imagine that deep in their souls they must feel no small
amount of shame and disgrace. Powerless militarily, politically, economically
and above all morally, they have little credibility and no real standing, except
as obedient pawns on the American-Israeli chessboard. Perhaps they feel they are
playing a waiting game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Perhaps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">But they (like Arafat and his men) haven't learned the
power of systematically disseminated information as a way of protecting their
people from the onslaughts of those who consider all Arabs militant, extremist,
terrorist fanatics. The good news is that the time for that sort of
irresponsible and contemptible behavior is very short. Will the new generation
do any better?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">It is for a whole new attitude toward secular education
to decide the answer, whether collectively we go down again to disorganisation,
corruption and mediocrity or whether at last we can become a nation.</font></p>
