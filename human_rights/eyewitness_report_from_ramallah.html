  Urgent: Eyewitness report from Ramallah</p>
  <p>Ramallah, Occupied Palestine: My name is Tzaporah Ryter. I am an American
  student from the University of Minnesota. I currently am in Ramallah. We are
  under a terrible siege and people are being massacred by both the Israeli army
  and armed militia groups of Israeli settlers. They are shooting outside at
  anything that moves. I am urgently pleading for as much outside help as
  possible to help save lives here.</p>
  <p>I arrived in Ramallah last Thursday. I had come back for a visit to the
  Palestinian city where I had been previously living and studying. On Thursday
  afternoon, the Israeli army began sealing off each entrance to Ramallah and
  there were rumors that they planned to invade.</p>
  <p>People were rushing back home from across checkpoints and also people were
  trying to flee. People were not allowed to go out and many working people --
  with homes and children to return to -- were not allowed in, everyone was
  trying to take cover. Those traveling in began desperately searching for
  alternative ways and traveling in groups, but the Israelis were firing upon
  them and everyone was running and screaming.</p>
  <p>Women carrying their children were trying desperately to flee from Ramallah,
  carrying infants and toddlers, and their young children were running along
  trying to reach safety. Israeli jeeps were speeding across the terrain pulling
  up from every direction and shooting at the women and children, and also at
  me, as we ran in opposite directions. They were chasing down people, hunting
  them like that in the fields.</p>
  <p>When I reached Ramallah, people were panicking and trying to buy bread,
  rice and milk from corner stores, but most supplies were already gone. We
  bought what we could and went inside to wait for what was coming.</p>
  <p>When night fell, Israeli tanks began to invade and also we saw Israeli
  troops coming on foot from the valley, and surrounding our house. I could hear
  them calling to each other in Hebrew. They were against our door and all
  around. They were firing everywhere a barrage of bullets and there was tank
  fire. We had to lay on the floor and keep silent. We stayed there, on the
  floor, for nearly four days in the darkness.</p>
  <p>We knew that our circumstances were better than others because old people
  or infants or people with medical emergency needs had no help. It was very
  cold, with most families packed all in one room. Some people are without life
  sustaining medicines like insulin, and they are altering their doses
  dangerously if they have any medicine left to take. People are becoming
  dangerously sick from lack of food and water and heat. The fear and terror
  only makes things worse, but it cannot be avoided.</p>
  <p>In the daytime, we heard them shooting people in the streets, and could
  hear them screaming and screaming. No ambulance was allowed through. Then
  their screams stopped and there was just silence.</p>
  <p>We had a telephone and would receive calls from all over telling us what
  was happening. Everyone is in grave danger and Israeli soldiers were killing
  people everywhere. They are arresting medics and ambulance drivers, including
  foreign volunteer medical workers.</p>
  <p>They keep taking doctors and medics, just now another call. Again, this
  time the wife of a doctor telling us her husband has been taken from the
  ambulance.</p>
  <p>Large groups of people have been found in rooms, shot dead, there are blood
  marks where they have lined people up on their knees and shot them, with their
  ID cards laying on top of them. They are taking people from their homes,
  blindfolding them, removing their clothes, taking them away or lining them up
  and shooting them against the wall.</p>
  <p>People are making phone calls and saying that these soldiers and militia
  have come in and are shooting people and then the line cuts off.</p>
  <p>The numbers of these killings I fear are much greater than the numbers
  confirmed in the press, because the human rights offices and the media centers
  have been stormed, and everything is shut down. No one can move without almost
  certain chance of being shot by the Isreali snipers, who are everywhere.</p>
  <p>The Israelis are demanding that all journalists leave Ramallah and today
  another foreign journalist was shot. They do not want any more internationals
  here and are deporting people. It seems quite clear that they do not want
  eyewitnesses which is only heightening my own fears.</p>
  <p>The hospitals have also been surrounded and invaded and Israeli troops are
  taking the injured people and interrogating them. Today a woman, a patient,
  tried to walk out from hospital. The Israelis shot her in the neck and killed
  her.</p>
  <p>The Palestinian Ministry of Health is saying that they fear the spread of
  diseases because of the number of unburied corpses.</p>
  <p>The numbers are only growing in reports of the mass killings here and
  Israeli troops continue to round up people. People are calling frantically,
  missing a relative and we do not know where they have been taken, including
  children.</p>
  <p>The numbers we have now exceed 600, and we are estimating between 700 and
  800. All human rights groups and legal advocates are being denied any
  information of where the detained are being held. From what we know confirmed
  is that 10% of those taken so far have been children under age 18.</p>
  <p>On the fourth day I decided to try to move. People were running out of
  supplies and I also was so worried about people, and had to check to see if
  they were okay. If I didn't, I feared panic would overtake me so badly that I
  really had no other choice but to try and go.</p>
  <p>It was not safe where I was in any case and at least if I left I would
  still have my sanity. It was really terrifying as there are some
  internationals here, usually traveling in groups, and the Israelis are saying
  on the radio that they will arrest or shoot the internationals. They did shoot
  some yesterday and regardless, it's not as if snipers differentiate and they
  are everywhere.</p>
  <p>My friends told me not to go, and were really scared for me, but I had to
  go. When I went outside, there were cars all shot up and hit by multiple
  bullets and shells in the middle of the road, unparked. There must have been
  people in them but I don't know where their bodies are. There are no reports
  of them, but they must exist.</p>
  <p>I got to the corner trying to go to the bakery for bread and food for
  people. Some people were calling and calling with only one cup of rice left. I
  made it to the corner but they opened fire on my first try, and shot at me, so
  I had to turn back.</p>
  <p>After that I tried again and it took me one day to make it a block because
  I had to start over again and again. I had to climb through the valley, and as
  I passed house by house, people were warning me and pointing out what path
  seemed safest for these two minutes. In the next two minutes, it would be
  something different. They really helped to keep my path safe.</p>
  <p>Today is Day Five and they are still rounding up people like this and we
  hear them shooting all day long.</p>
  <p>This afternoon the Israelis suddenly lifted the curfew, suddenly announcing
  that everyone had two hours to go out to get food. However, the Israeli
  soldiers also took food from many of the stores, looted, and there is no bread
  or things. People went to get whatever they could.</p>
  <p>Even though the Israeli army said it had lifted the closure for two hours
  -- in which we still were not able to transfer medical supplies and still was
  not long enough to everything that was badly needed -- the Israelis continued
  shooting people in the streets indiscriminately on their way, so people were
  running around trying to make it to the store or find a safe route only to
  have to run back home again. It was an added cruelty and terror tactic in this
  macabre situation, a sick joke: starve people and then shoot them when they
  try to find food with your permission.</p>
  <p>In an apartment building in Beitunia neighborhood where I used to live,
  they took 60 people who were my neighbors, including several familes, and
  pushed them into one room since last night. The Israelis told them that they
  are to be used as &quot;human shields&quot;, as the apartment building is
  across from a building that they were invading.</p>
  <p>One child needs to go to the hospital since last night and, initially, the
  families were able to call outside. Now, the Israelis have taken their phones.</p>
  <p>There are reports that they are rounding up men between the ages of 14 and
  45 in that neighborhood, and these civilians, from these same Palestinian
  families trapped in that building, were just used to walk in front of an
  Israeli tank as it invaded the Preventative Security Compound.</p>
  <p>Reports also have alleged that the Israelis were saying that some could
  leave but shot them when they attempted to leave. The buildings there are
  burning, and people are trapped inside.</p>
  <p>We keep calling to try to find people but there has been no electricity and
  most people's phones are dead now. I do not know what is happening to many
  people. The only solution to this is to try to brave the deadly streets in
  order to check, but its almost impossible and terrifying to leave the house at
  all.</p>
  <p>Each place I come to, I am afraid to leave not only for myself but for
  everyone else in this horrifying position. Israeli death squads have been
  yanking people into the street. I also hear only shooting and shooting, with
  no return fire. This suggest that unarmed civilians are being gunned down
  mercilessly everywhere and I am so scared for everyone. I feel like maybe if I
  leave one place, one area or neighborhood I will never see the people again
  alive.</p>
  <p>There are more explosions outside now and more shooting. Another explosion.
  More firing, it just doesn't stop.</p>
  <p>This is a massacre. The foreign delegations tried to get in but were turned
  back, the International Committee of the Red Cross is trying to help but they
  are being ignored. Please help.</p>
  <p>I am not only scared for myself and for people here, but if this cannot be
  stopped, I am truly scared for all of humanity, for a world in which we send
  men to the moon but cannot stop ethnic cleansing.</p>
  <p>On the news in America, we see hardly anything of demonstrations. What are
  you doing over there?</p>
  <p>There do not seem to be any reports of what is happening. In truth, its got
  to stop. Please go out to the streets, please demand a response from your
  representatives. Be loud, march up to the capitals, refuse to leave until the
  Israelis withdraw. Act now! Tell them the Israelis are murdering innocent
  people whose only crime is being born in their own homeland, a Palestinian
  under a military occupation.</p>
  <p>Demand international protection for the Palestinian people, scream that
  this is an affront to humanity and that it is time that the US not only stop
  supporting Israel, but that the US stop its abuse of human rights within its
  own borders. This is about all of our struggles. For the love of God, please
  stop this slaughter. Please help.</p>
