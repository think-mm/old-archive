  <p>Dear Mukto-monas,</p>
  <p>Bangladesh intellectuals has issued a press statement appealing to the
  Pakistani President General Musharraf 29<sup>th</sup> August to save the life
  of Dr Shaikh. Following is the English version of their statement which was
  issued originally in Bengali (see attachment)</p>
  <p>Professor Ajoy Roy,</p>
  <p>30th August</p>
  <u>
  <p><b>Press statement of a group of intellectuals from Bangladesh</b></p>
  </u></font><font face="Arial" size="3">
<p align="justify">&quot; We learned with deep anxiety and concern that a lower
court in Islamabad has pronounced death penalty on Dr. Younus Shaikh under the
blasphemy law prevailing in Pakistan. Forty-five years old Dr. Shaikh, an UK
trained medical doctor is a teacher of Physiology in a Medical College in
Islamabad. His offence was that about a year ago, during a routine class lecture
he allegedly said that until Prophet Muhammad (Sm.) received the message of
Islam from Allah through Gibrail at the age of 40, he and his parents were
non-Muslims. This utterance of his, to the Mullahs and Islamic Fundamentalists,
appears to be blasphemous and derogatory to Islam and the Prophet. We wonder
what is happening in the so-called Islamic State of Pakistan - where the words:
freedom of speech, religious tolerance, freethinking and secularism are taboo.
The offence that Dr. Sheikh has committed in the eye of the Mullahs is that he
nourishes and nurtures the noble concepts of freethinking, liberal democracy,
mutual tolerance and respect among peoples irrespective of their religious
faiths, and freedom of speech. He is the founder President of the organization
&quot;Enlightenment&quot;, a centre for cultivating freethinking and rationalism
coupled with humanism. This is a member organization of Pakistan based
International Humanist and Ethical Union -through which Dr. Shaikh has been
propagating his humanistic ideas and ethics of human rights. These activities of
Dr. Sheikh are the real offences to the eye of the theocratic Pakistani
Government which more or less represents fundamentalists; - the alleged remarks
against the Prophet is a mere plea to put him to trial.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">We have no language to deplore the verdict of the lower
court; -this verdict of the court we regard is a judicial murder. We appeal to
Pakistani President General Musharraf to drop this so-called blasphemy case
against the innocent victim and urge upon for his immediate release. We also
urge upon the Pakistani Government to repeal this malicious and ill-defined
law(s) and release all the convicts &amp; accused under trial forthwith.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">We also appeal to our President and the Chief Advisor to the
President to take up the matter with Pakistani Government at the highest level
to secure immediate release of the dedicated humanist Dr. M. Younus Shaikh of
Pakistan. &quot;</p>
