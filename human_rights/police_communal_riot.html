  published in English as 'Curfew in the City'. He is also the author of

  Hindu-Muslim Riots in India'. In this interview with Yoginder Sikand he talks 
  about the role of the Indian police in handling communal riots. </font></i>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: How did you decide 
  to write a book on the subject of the police in handling communal riots?
  </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: My book is the 
  outcome of a one-year fellowship that I received from the National Police 
  Academy to study perception of police neutrality during incidents of 
  Hindu-Muslim violence. Basically, the study set out to examine how Hindus and 
  Muslims perceive the role of the police in different ways in such situations. 
  In the course of my study I discovered, not surprisingly, that Hindu and 
  Muslim perceptions of the police during communal disturbances are 
  diametrically opposed. This is basically what I tried to show in my book.
  </font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: How do you account 
  for these different perceptions of the police by Hindus and Muslims? </font>
  </b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: In the course of my 
  study I found that in a normal situation an average Hindu does not necessarily 
  see the police as friendly or helpful but during communal riots he looks upon 
  the police as a helper and protector. On the other hand, Muslim riot victims 
  do not generally feel that they would get any protection from the police, even 
  when their lives and property are under threat. I think one basic reason for 
  this is the police themselves. After all, an average policeman-and most 
  policemen are Hindus-gets his value system from his own society or community. 
  And that is why the average policeman often thinks of Muslims in very negative 
  terms. Many policemen seem to believe the standard stereotypical images of 
  Muslims being 'dirty', 'untrustworthy', 'violent' and 'pro-Pakistani'. And 
  this is what leads to them thinking of Muslims as 'aggressors' who initiate 
  riots. Now, of course this is not true to say that most riots are started by 
  Muslims.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But still, when I point 
  out to police officers that many more Muslims than Hindus lose their lives in 
  the riots and so it is improbable that they could be said to have initiated 
  them, they generally refuse to agree. They claim that Hindus are, by nature, 
  'pious' and 'non-violent', and 'law abiding', and would, therefore, never 
  initiate violence themselves. This perception seems to be deeply rooted in 
  their psyche. My argument is that if you analyse the history of various riots 
  that have taken place in India since 1960 or so, you will find that there has 
  probably been no single riot in which less than 90% of those killed have been 
  Muslims, but this point is generally not accepted by the average policeman, 
  although I am basing my claim on official records. I am not surprised that 
  many police officers do not wish to recognise this fact. They , like an 
  average Hindu , would disbelieve these figures .But these are official figures 
  and no government on this earth would release false data which may show that 
  minorities are not safe under its territory. After all, even Hitler did not 
  openly admit the fact of the persecution of the Jewish minority in Germany, 
  and, claimed, instead that the Jews were the cause of all the troubles in the 
  country. In India, I must say, many of the so-called Hindu-Muslim riots are 
  nothing of the sort-they are simply clashes between Muslims and the police.
  </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: What do you feel 
  about the sort of training that is given to the police? Are they taught to 
  deal with incidents of communal violence in a neutral way? </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: Theoretically, such 
  inputs are given to the policemen when they undertake their training course. 
  However, the training period is only for nine months, and in this short period 
  you cannot completely disabuse them of the communal stereotypes that they have 
  imbibed from their family and society. The course is sufficiently long to 
  train a person only to handle a weapon. In any case, in the course little 
  attention is devoted to history, culture, religion and other social issues. 
  There is also no regular training component after this initial period.. And 
  then again there is this factor of the infiltration of the police by the RSS, 
  but this is difficult to quantify. I think there must be periodic training 
  sessions after the initial course, where policemen should be thoroughly 
  briefed on a range of social issues, including respect for and knowledge of 
  different religions. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: Are there any 
  efforts being made to provide this sort of training input? </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: As far as I know, 
  there have been few organised or institutional initiatives undertaken in this 
  regard. Dr. Asghar Ali Engineer is doing some useful work in this direction. 
  His institute arranges workshops with the Mumbai police to sensitise them on a 
  range of issues related to communalism. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: What, then, do you 
  think is the solution to the problem? </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: I think one major 
  solution is to institute reservation for the different minorities in the 
  police services, where they are now very poorly represented. And by minorities 
  I do not mean just Muslims but other religious minorities and even minority 
  ethnic groups in every state as well. Reservation for minorities should, 
  ideally, be in accordance with their share in the total population. Now, some 
  people, including police officers, will argue that reservations in the police 
  service for minorities would divide the police on communal lines. They might 
  argue that instead of reserving jobs for minorities in the police services we 
  should encourage the minorities to apply for police jobs. But my reply to them 
  is that ever since the independence of India the government has sent out 
  dozens of circulars, orders and guidelines to recruitment boards asking for a 
  fair recruitment of the minorities in the police service, but this has not 
  worked because it has not been made mandatory but has! been left entirely to 
  the discretion of the boards. At times one notices a bias in the boards 
  against recruiting Muslims into the police. I've heard some police officers 
  even arguing that if Muslims are recruited they will run off with their 
  weapons to Pakistan or else use them to promote 'anti-national' activities. 
  When I was serving in Kashmir in BSF I used to hear this argument very often. 
  However, despite this I took the initiative of recruiting local Kashmiri 
  Muslims into the Force, and although there were a few stray cases of 
  desertions I think the decision was well worth taking. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But when I talk of 
  representation for minorities in the police service I also want to stress that 
  this should only be for the backward sections among them. Now, in the case of 
  Muslim , the Muslim elites or Ashraf do not want to recognise the fact of 
  caste differences in the Muslim community. They talk of Muslims as a monolith, 
  which is not the case. I think reservations for the Muslims must be restricted 
  to the backward sections or biraderis among them, the so-called Ajlaf Muslims. 
  The Ashraf are, on the whole, capable of taking care of their own interests, 
  while the Ajlaf are poverty-stricken and they also suffer the most during 
  communal riots. I am opposed to the idea of reservations for Muslims as an 
  entire community. If that is done then the Ashraf are bound to occupy all the 
  positions as they are more educated and better-off than the other Muslims.
  </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: Perhaps 
  encouraging Muslims to join the police services would be a less controversial 
  way of promoting Muslim representation in the services. What are your opinions 
  on this? </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: No, I don't quite 
  agree, because I think that many recruiting officers themselves have a bias 
  against Muslims and would not be happy to see Muslims join the police. They 
  will put up all sorts of flimsy excuses to see that this does not happen. They 
  will claim that Muslims simply do not apply, and if they do apply they might 
  dismiss their applications by claiming that they are not physically fit, which 
  might be totally wrong. I think that, in fact, very little effort is needed to 
  encourage Muslims to apply, and if one is serious about it one can get 
  numerous such applications. After all, unemployment, even among the educated, 
  is rampant among Muslims. And then there is this feeling that wearing a police 
  uniform is a matter of prestige. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: How do you think 
  that increasing representation of minorities in the police services through 
  reservations will actually change things? </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: I think it will make 
  a tremendous impact, and will help increase the confidence of the minorities 
  in the police. It will also help undermine the communal stereotypes which, as 
  I mentioned, are quite deeply ingrained among many policemen and police 
  officers. If Muslim and Hindu policemen live and work together it is bound to 
  lead to a change in mutual perceptions and promote a sense of understanding. 
  In turn this will also lead to more responsible handling of riot situations by 
  the police. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: What do you feel 
  about the performance of Muslim police officers in handling riot situations?
  </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: Normally, Muslim 
  police officers are as good or as bad, as competent or incompetent, as other 
  officers. However, in situations of communal riots many Muslim officers do not 
  have the courage to get out of the police stations for fear of being killed. 
  Muslim officers might be reluctant to deal with Hindu mobs for fear of being 
  accused of being 'anti-Hindu'. They might feel that they do not have the 
  confidence of the police force, which is largely Hindu. Just to cite an 
  instance, in the recent violence in Gujarat a Muslim police officer was mobbed 
  by a group of Hindus and narrowly managed to escape with his life. </font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: How do you look at 
  the phenomenon of communalism? How does it influence your writing? </font></b>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: I must confess that 
  as a youth I was associated with the RSS and even attended the local shakha. 
  Later, I came under the influence of Marxism, which is how I changed my way of 
  looking at the world. I believe that all forms of communalism are dangerous. 
  The communalism of the majority is more dangerous because it is capable of 
  capturing state power. At the same time minority communalism must also be 
  fought against, including by the minorities themselves, for whom it poses a 
  grave danger while deceptively appearing to champion their interests. </font>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Q: How has your book 
  on the police and communalism been received by police and other government 
  officials? </font></b></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A: I must say that not 
  many people in the police or in government actually read my book, but from 
  those who did I got mixed responses. Some praised it, but many others 
  condemned it. They claimed that I was creating dissensions among the police! 
  They even alleged that findings and my conclusions were biased because they 
  could not believe that some Hindus, too, can be aggressive, intolerant and 
  violent. This, of course, itself suggests that prejudices about other 
  communities are very deeply rooted in our society, including among government 
  and police officials, who ought to know better. </font></p>
