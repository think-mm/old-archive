  <p align="center"><b><font color="#000080" size="4">An
Appeal from Mukto-mona:</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font color="#800000" size="4"><b>Stop
Brutal Extermination of Palestinians&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The recent actions of the government of Ariel Sharon have
gone far, far beyond the boundaries of acceptable conduct from any government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Israeli government has supposedly lurched into action because of the
suicide bombings carried out by the Palestinians.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the distinction that must be made here is that an elected
government that allegedly operates following democratic norms and conditions,
should not respond by indiscriminate attacks upon a civilian population to
“capture” militants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Israeli government has proclaimed that their all out offensive on the
Palestinians is a success as they have already captured “terrorist” leaders
and active militants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
question that needs to be asked is whether the price that innocent have to pay
for this “success” of Israel is either worth it or acceptable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The rights or wrongs of Palestinian actions and/or demands
are no longer an issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether one
supports the cause of the Palestinians or not is no longer an issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These aspects of the situation have been neutralized by the Israeli
government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is</i>
today’s issue is the all out offensive being carried out by the state of&nbsp;
<st1:country-region>
<st1:place>
Israel</st1:place>
</st1:country-region>
 against ALL Palestinians.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What is
at stake today is not a few settlements, not strips of occupied lands, nor is it
quibbles about whether it was the Palestinians or the Israelis that are more to
blame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What is at stake today is
clearly and simply the very survival of a whole people.</p>

ethnic cleansing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The government of
<st1:country-region>
<st1:place>
Israel</st1:place>
</st1:country-region>
 ’s actions are accomplishing the aim of creating a truly Jewish state, where
religious pluralism will not, cannot and must not exist.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><o:p>Notwithstanding the moral ambiguities
present in the Palestinian suicide bombings, the dubious and immoral quality of
Ariel Sharon’s actions remains open to question. A dubiousness that is
strongly reflected in the small but significant dissension that has arisen in
recent times even among the Israeli Jewish community as to this attempt at
systematic extermination of the Palestinian population.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">With all due respect to the sufferings that
the Jewish community have endured, Ariel Sharon’s “Final Solution” seems
to be a bigger problem than the problem it attempts to mitigate.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Therefore, we, people of diverse cultures,
countries and creeds, have come together for the common good to demand that the
rights of human beings be upheld against the rights of any particular state,
race or religion, and that the wholesale slaughter of Palestinians be stopped
immediately. We demand that Ariel Sharon be made to account for his war crimes
– both present and past.</p>
