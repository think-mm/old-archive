  Flogging, amputations and more death-by-stoning sentences<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></strong></span>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Amina Lawal Kurami could become the first
  person to be executed by stoning since the northern states of Nigeria have
  implemented Sharia (Islamic law).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The long awaited decision of the Islamic
  high court in Funtuas, Katsina state, shocked Nigeria’s growing human rights
  movement and people around the world. The court confirmed the barbarian
  judgment imposed upon the unwed mother by a <i>Sharia</i> court in Bakori in
  March 2002 on charges of adultery.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">This is the second judgment of its kind. The
  first woman sentenced to death by stoning was Safiyatu Husseini Tunga-Tuda,
  condemned in October 2001. Under the pressure of worldwide protest, the
  Islamic appeal court in Sokoto acquitted Safiyatu in March 2002 [we reported
  in Bulletin # 88 and Bulletin # 93]. There had been the expectation that the
  appeal court, too, would acquit Amina Lawal.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The cases are very similar. Both Safiyatu
  (35) and Amina (30) were divorced by their former husbands and got pregnant
  out of wedlock. Both did not understand the implications of the drastic change
  of the legal system, which had taken place, and had no lawyer, when they
  admitted intimate relations outside marriage to the authorities. In both cases
  their confession was reason enough for the <i>Sharia</i> courts to impose the
  highest possible punishment on them, while the fathers of their babies escaped
  for lack of evidence. Under <i>Sharia</i> rules of proof, a man can only be
  convicted of adultery if there are four male witnesses for the act, while an
  unmarried woman can be condemned simply for becoming pregnant.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">The acquittal by the appeal court in
  Safiyatu Husseini’s case was based on three reasons. First, the child had
  been conceived before <i>Sharia</i> was implemented in Sokoto state and
  therefore Islamic law was not applicable. Second, the accused had not been
  aware of the dire consequences of her confession, and third, she did not have
  a lawyer. Safiyatu was given opportunity by the appeal court to modify her
  statement and presented the astonishing – though under Islamic law
  officially acceptable – explanation that the baby was the child of her
  former husband only, which had been “sleeping” in her for two years after
  divorce.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Amina Lawal’s team of lawyers from the
  capital Abuja, who have meantime been organized by the Women’s Rights
  Advance and Protection Alternative, presented the same arguments, however
  without success. Amina had told the authorities in January that her then
  new-born daughter Wasilia was an offspring of her 11-moths-lasting intimate
  relation with her boy friend Yahaya Mahmud, who wanted to marry her. This
  confession remained the base of her conviction. The court was unimpressed by
  any protest. “Based on proofs derived through our investigations and through
  Islamic books I, Aliyu Abdullahi, and my three assistants hereby uphold your
  conviction of death by stoning as prescribed by the <i>Sharia</i>. This
  judgment will be carried out as soon as your baby is weaned”, declared the
  presiding judge. The ruling was answered with cheering and cries of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>“God is great!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>from
  the public gallery of the packed courtroom.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Meantime an appeal has lodged
  with the higher court, informed the lawyers.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center">***</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Nigeria is the most populous state of
  Africa. Half of its 120 million people are Muslims, half Christians. In 2000,
  the states of the predominantly Muslim north of the country started to
  implement <i>Sharia</i>. This triggered violent communal clashes, in which
  during the past three years more than 3000 people were killed. There are 12 <i>Sharia</i>
  states now, whose Muslim population is forced under the jurisdiction of
  religious penal courts, imposing barbarian punishments on them. Several men
  and young boys have been convicted to amputation of limbs for petty thefts.
  Some amputations have been already executed. A teenage girl, who became
  pregnant after being raped by three men, was punished for her “crime” with
  hundred public lashes last year. The list of alleged “adulterers”, being
  sentenced to death by stoning, is growing. So far, no execution by stoning has
  taken place.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Yunusa Ratin Chiyawa in Bauchi state, convicted to
  death by stoning in June for having a relation with a married woman, is the
  first man to face this punishment. The judgment was based on his confession;
  he had no lawyer. The woman was let free, as she claimed Yunusa had cast a
  spell on her. Amnesty International reported that the Bauchi state
  representative of the federal justice ministry tried to get the case
  transferred from the <i>Sharia</i> court to the high court of state, where
  there is no death penalty for adultery, but the <i>Sharia</i> court refused
  the transfer. It is not known if and how the dispute about competence between
  religious and state court has been solved and what is the further fate of the
  convicted.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Fatima Usman, divorced mother of 2 children, together
  with her boy friend Ahmadu Ibrahim, have been sentenced to death by stoning by
  an upper <i>Sharia</i> court in Niger state in August. The couple had been
  convicted for extra marital relations to 5 years jail in May. The upper court
  imposed the death sentence, after Fatima’s father lodged a complaint that
  the jail term was too mild a punishment. Their lawyer has filed an appeal.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The federal government of Nigeria under President
  Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian, did not appreciate the implementation of <i>Sharia</i>
  in the northern states, but did not stop it either. In March 2002, alarmed by
  an international outcry against the death sentence for Satiyatu Husseini, the
  government made a half-hearted move to ban Islamic law. Justice Minister Kanu
  Agabi informed the 12 states concerned that <i>Sharia</i> was inhuman and
  violated the Nigerian constitution, but no further steps were taken. In fact, <i>Sharia</i>
  violates not only the Nigerian constitution, but also several international
  human rights legal instruments, signed and ratified by Nigeria. The federal
  government has therefore nothing less than the duty to ban <i>Sharia</i> in
  order to uphold the values and principles enshrined in the constitution as
  well as to guarantee the implementation of international human rights acts.
  But it seems to prefer a comfortable policy of non-interference. A speaker of
  the governor of Katsina state made it clear to the media that there would be
  no interference whatsoever in the case of Amina Lawall. President Obasanjo is
  quoted as saying: “I don’t think what is going on will lead to her death.
  Indeed, if it does, which I very much doubt, I will weep for myself, I will
  weep for Amina and I will weep for Nigeria.”</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">President Obasanjo has to be politely told that the
  civilized world expects more from him than tears: We expect him to uphold law
  and order and the constitution of his country and to respect international
  human rights standards. We expect him therefore to ban Sharia and stop the
  execution of cruel and inhuman punishments like flogging and amputations with
  immediate effect. We expect him to guarantee for the life of Amina Lawal and
  all others currently sentenced to death under the Islamic law. We expect him
  to prevent that Nigeria goes Taliban!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
