        <p><font color="green">INTRODUCTION</font></b>
        <p><font color="green">The recent widespread communal violence in
        Gujarat has shocked the world. The UN Human Rights Commissioner Mary
        Robinson has also voiced her deep concern. People from all walks of life
        in India have reacted with shock and dismay. The BJP government of
        Gujarat, as well as the NDA government at the Centre, have attributed
        the communal violence which broke out in Ahmedabad and other places on
        28<sup>th</sup> February 2002, to the anger of the Hindus over the
        gruesome burning of <i>ram sewaks</i> in Godhra in the early morning of
        27th February. The spontaneous outburst of the people following the
        massacre of the VHP activists, they argue, reached such proportions
        because of the ‘failure’ of the Opposition parties to condemn the
        incident unequivocally as well as the role of the national media which
        publicized ‘one sided stories’. The Home Minister has also commended
        the role of the Narendra Modi government in the Parliament, in having
        created a record of sorts by controlling the violence within ’72
        hours’ as opposed to previous instances of communal riots under non-BJP
        regimes.</font>
        <p><font color="green">This theory of a spontaneous outburst of popular
        Hindu anger contrasted to the pre-planned massacre of VHP ‘pilgrims’
        by ISI funded Islamic fundamentalists, lies at the core of the overt and
        covert justifications of the post-Godhra events, put forward by the
        Sangh brigade along with some allies of the BJP. For a preliminary
        assessment of the Gujarat situation, and as an act of solidarity with
        the suffering victims, SAHMAT organized a two day visit to Ahmedabad by
        a fact-finding team of Dr. Kamal Mitra Chenoy, Vishnu Nagar, Prasenjit
        Bose and Vijoo Krishnan on 10th and 11th March, 2002. The team visited
        several relief camps including two of the biggest in Bapunagar and Shah
        Alam, and a number of affected localities, and prepared this Report
        based on its experiences. We are grateful to Fr. Cedric Prakash of
        Prashant, Ahmedabad, and Teesta Setalvad, joint editor, <u>Communalism
        Combat</u>, Mumbai, and many other volunteers for the advice and help
        they gave us.</font><b>
        <p><font color="green">Ethnic Cleansing not Communal Riot</font></b>
        <p><font color="green">At the outset it is important to underline the
        fact that the events in Ahmedabad do not fit into any conceivable
        definition of a communal riot. All evidence suggests that what happened
        there was a completely one sided and targeted carnage of innocent
        Muslims, something much closer to a pogrom or an ethnic cleansing.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Moreover, the selective violence that was
        perpetrated was done with remarkable precision, suggesting meticulous
        planning and collation of information over a protracted period, rather
        than the spontaneous mob frenzy characteristic of a communal riot. It
        also clearly indicates collusion and not merely indulgence of the state
        machinery and the ruling political establishment. The condemnable Godhra
        massacre was of course the trigger in this case. But the point is that
        it could have been anything else, any provocative act on the part of any
        Muslim individual or group, possibly even of a lesser magnitude, would
        have led to similar consequences. The ground for this communal genocide
        was cleared in Gujarat much prior to the Godhra massacre. It is
        noteworthy that the attacks on the Muslims in Ahmedabad and the rest of
        Gujarat started a day after the Godhra tragedy, further indicating that
        this was no merely spontaneous reaction, but one connected to the Vishva
        Hindu Parishad [VHP] Gujarat Bandh call on 28th February.</font>
        <p><font color="green">The casualties reported officially are
        understatements. According to those involved in relief and
        rehabilitation work (who are also involved in collecting information
        regarding the actual number of casualties) the number of people killed
        in Ahmedabad alone would be nearly 1000. As against the total of around
        700 including the victims of Godhra, which the government has cited as
        the total figure of casualties for the whole of Gujarat, they say that
        the number would be around 2000 if not more. Since the violence has
        spread to remote villages, access to which has been denied by the
        government, any estimation of the number of casualties by
        non-governmental sources has been rendered difficult.</font>
        <p><font color="green">An overwhelming majority of those who have been
        killed are Muslims, including women and children. While most of the dead
        fell victims to killer mobs led by VHP-Bajrang Dal activists, there were
        several instances of death due to police firing on helpless Muslims.
        Some eyewitness accounts of those who had fled from nearby villages
        (45-50 kms. from Ahmedabad) and taken refuge in the relief camps,
        suggest large-scale massacres of Muslims continuing in the countryside.
        Entire families have been exterminated in villages with nobody left to
        lodge complaints or claim the dead bodies.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Almost everybody suggested that the carnage this
        time have surpassed all previous instances of communal riots in Gujarat
        (1969, 1985, 1989 or 1992) both in terms of loss of lives, as well as in
        terms of the barbarism involved. It was added everywhere that never
        before had the killings been so one sided, which makes comparisons being
        made with the earlier riots also quite misleading.</font><b>
        <p><font color="green">Nature of Violence</font></b>
        <p><font color="green">The most prominent form of violence experienced
        in Ahmedabad were in the form of pogroms led by local level VHP and
        Bajrang Dal leaders in Muslim dominated areas. The long history of riots
        had already altered the geography of Ahmedabad an communal lines with
        majority of the Muslims being ghettoized in certain areas. This time
        several such Muslim dominated areas, mostly working class localities
        were targeted, some for the first time, by huge mobs numbering 5,000 to
        15,000.</font>
        <p><font color="green">The worst instance of such an attack was at <i>Naroda
        Pattiya</i> where a big settlement of Muslims of about 25,000
        inhabitants was completely destroyed by the rioters. Survivors of the
        attack who are now spread over several relief camps in the city recall
        that the local police totally sided with the riotous mob. The <i>Noorani
        masjid</i> was first attacked and burnt with the help of LPG cylinders,
        tyres, petrol and kerosene. When some of the Muslim youth tried to
        resist the mob, the police fired at them and even killed some. Residents
        in the camps claimed that the Special Reserve Police [SRP] force present
        refused to provide them sanctuary and forced them towards the waiting
        rioters. Once the resistance was broken with the help of the police, the
        rioters stormed inside the settlement, burning and looting at will.
        Eyewitness after eyewitness in the relief camps described gory incidents
        of children being burnt alive and women being raped. One expectant
        woman’s belly was cut open, her foetus wrenched out and dashed to the
        ground. The enormity and ferocity of the attack forced all the surviving
        residents of the settlement to run away.Every house was looted and burnt
        and the entire settlement completely devastated.</font>
        <p><font color="green">The falsity of the official figures suggesting
        only around 70 deaths in the <i>Naroda Pattiya</i> incident was evident
        from the testimony of so many survivors from that area who named their
        kith and kin whom they had seen dying in front of their eyes. The actual
        death toll will be much higher. Many also narrated how the SRP misguided
        a large group of people who were trying to escape into a trap, where the
        mob killed them and threw the bodies into a well. Most of the dead
        bodies were charred or mutilated beyond recognition and an overwhelming
        majority of the survivors did not manage to have access to the bodies of
        their relatives and perform the last rites in a dignified manner.
        Residents of <i>Naroda Pattiya</i> identified <i>Vipin</i> (owner of an
        Auto Agency), <i>Jai Bhagwan</i> of <i>Gangotri</i> Society, <i>Mukesh</i>
        (alias <i>Gudda)</i>, <i>Naresh </i>and <i>Chotta</i> , all local level
        BJP/VHP workers, as having murdered and raped before their eyes.
        Inspector Surela of the local Police Station had it seems visited <i>Naroda
        Pattiya</i> after the Godhra incident and had assured safety to the
        elders of the area. Several eyewitnesses recalled his active
        participation along with others in his force, in the carnage.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Another such major organized attack was carried
        out on a Muslim settlement at Sundaramnagar near the Bapunagar locality.
        A visit to the affected area, disclosed a similar pattern of attack,
        from the eyewitness accounts. A local <i>madrassa </i>situated near the
        boundary of the settlement was attacked by a mob of nearly 15,000
        accompanied by the police who fired at the Muslims who tried to offer
        resistance. Truckloads of LPG cylinders were brought and used to cause
        explosions inside the buildings. Trucks were also used to batter down
        the boundary wall to create a breach for the rioters to enter. A pitched
        battle was fought here between the Muslim inhabitants and the rioters
        who had surrounded them from three sides, for nearly 36 hours. During
        this period fresh batches of rioters were reportedly brought in luxury
        buses and fatigued ones taken away. Finally the resistance collapsed and
        the Muslim dwellers had to run away for their lives. The rioters entered
        into the settlement from all sides and carried out loot and arson on a
        large scale using petrol bombs and gas cylinders. Most of the dwellings
        in the settlement as well as private vehicles like scooters, bicycles or
        auto rickshaws were burnt completely. Even metallic furniture and
        ceiling fans had melted under the impact of the explosions.</font>
        <p><font color="green">The graffiti left behind by the rioters on the
        charred walls of the completely burnt madarasa at <i>Sundaramnagar</i>
        boasted of the police support:</font><i>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="green">Yeh andar ki bat hai<br>
          Police hamarey saath hai.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font color="green">[This is inside information, the police is with
        us].</font>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="green">Jaan se mar dengey<br>
          Bajrang Dal zindabad<br>
          Narendra Modi zindabad.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        </i>
        <p><font color="green">[We will kill. Long live the Bajrang Dal, long
        live Narendra Modi.]</font>
        <p><font color="green">Other Muslim settlements in the vicinity at <i>Akbarnagar,
        Rahmatnagar, Islamnagar, Madinanagar </i>and<i> Ansarnagar</i>, some
        being at a stone throws distance from the local Police Station or the
        local police officer’s office, were similarly attacked, looted, with
        many of their buildings burnt and razed to the ground.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Similar instances of such pogroms reveal certain
        common characteristics. Firstly the rioting mobs were huge ones and with
        a substantial segment properly trained for such activities. In fact,
        they more resembled a militia rather than spontaneously mobilized
        fanatics. The premeditated nature of the attacks is indicated by the
        almost exclusive selection of Muslim commercial establishments,
        residential areas and individual residences. After the experience of
        earlier riots, most of the Muslim establishments had non-Muslim, mainly
        Hindu names. Yet the attackers reportedly had lists, and specifically
        targeted Muslim properties. In instance after instance, we saw Muslim
        shops, workshops, and flats burnt and looted while the neighbouring
        Hindu owned properties were untouched. The <i>modus operandi</i> was
        often the same. Vehicles including trucks were brought to cart away the
        loot. In the cases of factories and commercial establishments that had
        strong grills and metal shutters, gas cutters were used to gain access.
        LPG cylinders were used to blow up residential rooms and shops.
        Thousands must have been used. Such massive provision of LPG cylinders
        must have involved official collusion, if not sanction.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Secondly, in most of the cases the attacks were
        organized on 1st March, i.e. the day of the VHP sponsored Gujarat bandh
        which was also supported by the State BJP unit. The Godhra incident
        having taken place on 27th February, it is evident that the day of 28th
        February was utilized to gear up and mobilize the huge machinery
        deployed for the pogroms. Thirdly, the connivance of the local police as
        well as the SRP was absolute. 1st March being a Friday, the attacks
        almost invariably started with police firing or provocation on the
        congregation of Muslims at <i>masjids</i> during the <i>jumma namaaz</i>
        . Fourthly, the brutalities were excessive including sexual violence
        against women and children and burning alive of helpless people.
        Fifthly, the attacks were led by local level VHP, Bajrang Dal and BJP
        leaders who had no fears of being identified or booked. These leaders,
        as well as leading attackers were allegedly carrying both mobile phones
        as well as water bottles. Finally, the entire effort suggests a
        concerted attempt to terrorize, uproot and drive away the Muslims even
        from their hitherto ghettoized settlements.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Since the entire purpose of the attacks was to
        kill and brutalize a particular community, irrevocably damage its
        economic interests, and force it out of earlier settlements to existing
        Muslim ghettoes, these attacks can only be described as ethnic
        cleansing. The partisan role of the state, the government, police, civil
        administration, the ruling party, the VHP, Bajrang Dal and the rest of
        the Sangh brigade, all point to this ethnic cleansing being state
        sponsored.</font><b>
        <p><font color="green">Targeting with Precision</font></b>
        <p><font color="green">The one sided nature of the violence mentioned
        above was further exemplified by the fact that the Hindu dominated areas
        surrounding the completely devastated Muslim settlements remained
        untouched and were back into normalcy within a few days. This selective
        violence, executed with remarkable precision has indubitably helped in
        preventing a consolidation of opinion within the majority community
        against the violence, if not gaining its tacit support. The message of
        the violence was quite clearly conveyed--if you are a Hindu you need not
        fear at all; this is not directed against you as long as you do not side
        with the Muslims.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Thousands of shops and business establishments
        belonging to the Muslims were ransacked and destroyed, often being
        selectively chosen from within a cluster of shops. A visit to Shalimar
        Complex where nearly 40 out of 50 odd shops belonged to Muslims
        disclosed how those were selectively targeted, looted and burnt on the
        day of the VHP sponsored bandh. A doctor couple whose chamber and
        pathological laboratory were situated in the complex was robbed of all
        their belongings including expensive medical equipment. The rioters came
        in large numbers and broke open the shutters and simply carried away
        every thing within the shops before burning them. Goods worth lakhs of
        Rupees were looted in this complex itself. Shops owned by Hindus were
        left untouched. Eyewitness accounts suggest that the Revenue Minister in
        Gujarat government (former Home Minister) Haren Pandya, and another
        Minister Ashok Bhatt were personally present during the looting and
        arson, and actually led the mobs.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Hotels and restaurants owned by Muslims also came
        in for this selective attack. Given the history of communal riots these
        restaurants were already running under ‘Hindu’ names like <i>Tulsi,
        Abhilasha</i> etc. to conceal their Muslim ownership. However, the
        information regarding every such business establishment was there with
        the rioters. It has been alleged that a local Gujarati daily <i>Sandesh</i>
        carried the names of all such Muslim owned establishments in Ahmedabad
        which were running under ‘Hindu’ names, about a month earlier. The
        worst such instance was the burning of the <i>Hans Inn</i> where
        inmates, mostly people from outside Gujarat, were not even allowed to
        come out and 14 of them were burnt alive inside the building. It is
        claimed that a Punjab Police officer and constable who had come for an
        investigation were among the victims. The name of Haren Pandya was
        repeatedly mentioned regarding this case also.</font><b>
        <p><font color="green">Socio-economic War against Muslims</font></b>
        <p><font color="green">This selective targeting of business
        establishments is only a part of the greater economic war the VHP
        proposes to wage against the Muslims in Gujarat. A leaflet circulated by
        the VHP (Annexure 1) calls for a total economic boycott of the Muslims
        in order to ‘throttle’ them, 'break their backbone’ so that ‘it
        will be difficult for them to live in any corner of this country’ . It
        is precisely this vision which was being implemented when Muslim
        establishments were being selectively looted and destroyed.</font>
        <p><font color="green">This communal project also becomes clear from the
        fact that Muslims from all sections of the population, from slum
        dwellers to businessmen and white collar professionals to senior
        government bureaucrats were targeted during the attacks. A visit to the
        posh locality of <i>Paldi</i> revealed how even the upper middle class
        sections of the Muslim community were targeted. The <i>Delite</i> and <i>Tarana</i>
        Apartments were completely gutted and the belongings of the Muslim flat
        owners of these multi-storied apartments looted. The residents included
        the Director of Industries, Gujarat government and a senior employee of
        the Gujarat University. Frantic phone calls to Ministers, ruling party
        politicians and even to politicians in Delhi could not prevent the total
        destruction of the apartments by a 5000 strong mob which broke open into
        the flats and ransacked them. The residents were able to avoid the fate
        of Ehsan Jafri (former Congress MP who was burnt alive in <i>Gulmarg
        Society</i> ) by silently hiding in the terrace of the building and not
        raising their voice even when the mobs went on a rampage inside their
        homes. They could not conceal their deep hurt while recollecting that
        many people from their neighbouring apartments whom they had known and
        lived together with for several years, not only cheered the rioters
        during the long they operation but some of them actually participated in
        it.</font>
        <p><font color="green">All these eerie experiences point towards a
        tremendous communalization of society that has taken place in Ahmedabad
        and other places of Gujarat. Hatred towards the Muslim minority has been
        systematically inculcated in such a manner that violence of barbaric
        proportions against them is not only widely condoned but also even
        enjoyed by certain sections of the Hindu communities. The press
        statement issued by noted historian Prof. K.N. Panikkar on 9th March
        after his visit to Ahmedabad, is thus significant:</font>
        <p><font color="green">&quot; <i>What happened in Ahmedabad and other
        towns and villages in Gujarat is not a spontaneous action. The methods
        used for destruction of life and property presupposes a fairly well
        organised preparation. It is clear that many incidents during these last
        ten days could not have happened without such a preparation. In a way it
        indicates a long-term process of communalisation and brutalisation of
        society. A major issue which society has to face is the influence of
        brutality, which appears to have conquered the minds of men. This is the
        result of the systematic and long-term atrocities of communal
        organisations and heightened by the irrational and emotional coercion of
        the people by both the VHP and the RSS.&quot;</i></font>
        <p><font color="green">It only needs to be added that even middle class
        women were found participating in the looting of jewelry and garment
        stores in the elite CG Road area of Ahmedabad during the VHP bandh,
        which also shows the extent comunalization of Gujarati society.</font>
        <p><font color="green">The collusion of the state was absolute. Firstly,
        the state administration and the police failed to protect the lives and
        properties of Muslim citizens, even when several people complaining
        about mobs attacking their homes or shops contacted them. Many of them
        were told that they would have to fend for themselves on that day.
        Secondly, in many cases BJP, VHP and Bajrang Dal leaders including
        Ministers and local corporators, actually led the mobs and supervised
        the killings and destruction. And finally, the Administration is now
        busy in ensuring a massive cover up.</font>
        <p><font color="green">While the role of the national print and
        electronic media has been applauded widely for its coverage of the
        violence and exposure of government’s negligence, the role of the
        local Gujarati media has hardly attracted adequate attention. Like in
        the past, the vernacular Gujarati press played an extremely biased role
        with the <i>Sandesh</i> directly contributing to incitement and
        provocation for violence. The <i>Gujarat Samachar,</i> the most widely
        circulated vernacular daily, was cynically referred to by many in having
        played a ‘moderate’ (communal) role this time compared to its
        earlier record.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Both the State and the local media have helped
        the VHP and RSS in organizing the violence against the minorities. Had
        it not been their collusion, neither would the rioters have had such
        precise information about the residences and business establishments of
        the Muslims, nor would the RSS-VHP have been able to mobilise the
        enormous machinery that was deployed to play havoc in Ahmedabad during
        this period. Thus describing the violence in Ahmedabad as a State
        sponsored ethnic cleansing would appear to be appropriate.</font><b>
        <p><font color="green">Condition of Relief Camps</font></b>
        <p><font color="green">The most glaring evidence of the bias of the Modi
        Government in Gujarat can be found in the condition of the 20 odd relief
        camps for Muslim refugees, which are being run in Ahmedabad alone.It is
        estimated that more than 70,000 Muslims have been rendered homeless and
        are staying in these camps spread across the city. The camps include
        bigger ones at <i>Shah-e-Alam Dargah</i> and <i>Aman Chowk</i> housing
        8-9,000 refugees and smaller ones like in <i>Sundaramnagar </i>and <i>Saraspur
        Pathrewali masjid</i> [Madhav Mill complex] having 3-4,000 people. A
        visit to these places confirmed allegations regarding total negligence
        and apathy of the government towards the innocent people who have been
        rendered refugees in their own land.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Before the all-party MP’s delegation visited
        Ahmedabad, some camps have been set up with government support housing
        Hindu refugees. While there are Hindu victims of the violence, their
        numbers and extents of loss are disproportionately lower than the
        Muslims and certainly not proportionate to what the government and VHP
        are seeking to establish. However, the communal attitude gets clearly
        exposed by the fact that while a Deputy Collector is in charge of the
        government run relief camp at <i>Kankaria</i> for the Hindu victims, the
        larger camps run for the Muslims have virtually no official support. No
        senior official or politician had visited the larger Muslim camps till
        as late as 11th March. In one of the smaller Muslim camps, two Deputy
        Mamladars had been deputed a day before the Chief Minister visited it on
        6th March. The all party MP’ s delegation was taken to only a handful
        of the smaller Muslim camps along with the Hindu camps to give a
        completely distorted picture of the violence that took place.</font>
        <p><font color="green">The Muslim camps are being run mainly through the
        support of community leaders and organisations, NGOs, missionaries and
        other private sources including some political organisations have also
        made significant donations. The rations, which the government has
        started giving very late, are grossly inadequate. In fact the Shah-e-Alam
        camp managers alleged that the weekly ration being given by the
        government is actually not sufficient for a single day’s consumption.
        Thousands of homeless people are having to stay under <i>shamianas</i>
        in the absence of any provision for their shelter. Blankets or clothes
        are not available. There is hardly any medical help in most places and
        even child births are taking place in the camps without proper medical
        facilities. The less said about sanitation the better. In Shah-e-Alam
        there is only one mobile toilet with 4 chambers for nearly 9,000 people!
        This is particularly disturbing because the Ahmedabad Municipal
        Corporation is Congress[I]-led and controlled.</font>
        <p><font color="green">With the government almost totally abdicating all
        responsibilities of providing relief, the issue of rehabilitation is
        shrouded in uncertainty. There has been no official recording of the
        Muslim refuges so far let alone any significant effort to lodge their
        complaints/FIRs by setting up police camps. Some complained about money
        being charged by the local police to register complaints. Moreover, no
        security has been provided to protect these camps from future attacks.
        The helpless, insecure and traumatized Muslim masses have been left to
        fend for themselves. According to a report, near one such Muslim camp in
        <i>Vatwa</i> , audio cassettes with cries and howls of ‘<i>maro maro</i>’
        are played at night on loudspeakers regularly, to further terrorize the
        refugees there who are yet to recover from the trauma of the violence on
        1st March.</font>
        <p><font color="green">It seems that the government is deliberately
        pushing this enormous number of Muslim population to the margins of
        survival. Due to the extremely unsanitary conditions there are genuine
        fears of outbreaks of epidemics in these camps. Moreover, since almost
        all the refugees have lost their ration cards and the government is
        showing no interest in identifying them, there is the dangerous
        possibility of a huge number of people losing their basic citizenship
        rights. The insecure residents of the camps have no place to go back
        since entire settlements have been completely demolished. Unless
        immediate relief and proper rehabilitation is ensured for the Muslim
        refugees, a great human tragedy of much larger proportions to what has
        already taken place, is bound to happen.</font>
        <p><font color="green">With the Ayodhya issue coming to dominate the
        centre stage of national politics, the plight of Muslims in Gujarat has
        not received the attention it merits. The media as well as the
        Opposition need to highlight the issue of relief and rehabilitation of
        the victims of the violence in Ahmedabad and other places immediately.
        Given the character of the State as well as the Central Government, it
        is only a concerted action on the part of the secular and democratic
        sections of society and the polity that a bigger human tragedy can be
        prevented.</font><b>
        <p><font color="green">Destruction of Historical Monuments and Places of
        Worship</font></b>
        <p><font color="green">Along with the butchering of human lives, there
        has been widespread destruction of <i>masjids </i>and <i>dargahs</i>.
        Rough estimates suggest 20 odd mosques being demolished in Ahmedabad
        alone. As has been mentioned earlier, the major attacks were organized
        on 1st March and the pattern seems to suggest targeting of mosques in
        all parts of city, during the Friday prayers. In most of the places,
        Hindu idols were placed on the site of the mosques after demolishing
        them, thus converting them into temples a la VHP style. In many cases,
        liquor was consumed within the mosques and madrassas, and holy books
        burnt within <i>madrassas</i> . The small Hindu temple within the Muslim
        locality of <i>Sundaramnagar</i> which remained unharmed while its
        neighbouring mosque and <i>madrassa</i> were burnt and destroyed, stood
        in sharp contrast to the vandalism of the VHP rioters.</font>
        <p><font color="green">However, these attacks on the mosques should not
        be seen only in terms of being acts of provocation meant to incite the
        Muslim minority by hurting religious sentiments. They were also
        accompanied by attacks on historical monuments. The famous 500-year-old
        masjid in Isanpur, which was an ASI monument, was destroyed with the
        help of cranes and bulldozers. The famous Urdu Poet <i>Wali Gujarati’s
        dargah</i> was also razed to the ground at Shahibag in Ahmedabad. While
        a <i>hanuman</i> shrine was built over its debris initially, all that
        was removed overnight and the plot was metalled and merged with the
        adjoining road. No authority claimed any knowledge about the entire
        episode. It is worth noting here that the Ahmedabad Municipal
        Corporation, which is responsible for the maintenance of all these
        structures, and for the building of roads, is run by the Congress with a
        near two-thirds majority.</font>
        <p><font color="green">VHP’s campaign to rename Ahmedabad as <i>Karnavati</i>
        is well known. In accordance with that revivalist project there has been
        over the past, a proliferation of roadside temples coming up overnight
        all over the city. Now taking advantage of the situation the same
        project seems to have been furthered by demolishing monuments and
        mosques which stood as symbols of the composite cultural heritage and of
        course served as deterrents to the RSS-VHP’ s distortion of the
        history of Ahmedabad.</font><b>
        <p><font color="green">Conclusion</font></b>
        <p><font color="green">The attitude among the affected Muslims in
        Ahmedabad today is of sheer despondency. The myths created by the
        VHP-RSS regarding Muslims being heavily armed by external forces stand
        shattered in the face of absolutely no resistance, armed or otherwise,
        on the latter’ s part. However, the fear and communal stereotypes,
        which has been instilled in the minds of many Hindus through years of
        propaganda, continues to make them apprehend violent retaliation.
        Reports say that even trucks carrying relief materials were stopped from
        moving into relief camps on the grounds that they might be carrying arms
        for Muslims.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Had it not been for the Army’s intervention,
        many more innocent Muslims would have been killed. Apart from the Army,
        no other institution of the state remains to be credible in the eyes of
        the affected people. Peace, security and justice seem to be a far cry
        for them.</font>
        <p><font color="green">The politically motivated statements by Chief
        Minister Modi, likening the communal conflagration to a Newtonian
        reaction, have only deepened their alienation. Union Home Minister L.K.
        Advani sought to defend the Modi government’s role in Parliament.
        Perhaps he would also be in the know of the allegations within his own
        Parliamentary constituency against the Gujarat Home Minister
        Gobardhanbhai Zapadia’s brother distributing arms and leading riotous
        mobs.</font>
        <p><font color="green">It will take generations for the victims to
        recover from such a pointed and vicious communal onslaught. It is of
        immediate importance to bring the perpetrators to book and prosecute
        them under the criminal laws of the country. The Government of Gujarat
        and its chief executive are widely believed to be responsible for this
        carnage. Therefore, the CG Shah enquiry instituted by them has little
        credibility. A high level and time bound judicial enquiry by a sitting
        Supreme Court/High Court judge should be instituted to look into the
        entire episode and bring the guilty to justice. The Union government
        must direct the Gujarat government to set up such an enquiry, and to
        provide it all necessary assistance expeditiously, so that it can arrive
        at its findings at the earliest. In the meanwhile, a CBI enquiry into
        the role of the police, with those with <i>prima facie</i> cases against
        them being suspended/transferred, may also be instituted. The role of
        the local Gujarati press must be examined by the Press Council, and
        where the laws of the land have been transgressed exemplary action must
        be taken, so that communal fires are not fanned again.</font>
        <p><font color="green">Proper and adequate relief measures should be
        given to all victims and no effort should be spared for their
        rehabilitation. Prompt and adequate compensation is a must. In view of
        the perceived partisanship of the Modi government, the local corporation
        and trusted civil society organisations must be involved. In a number of
        cases, Muslims would not like to return to their earlier localities.
        State as well as civil society efforts are required to rebuild trust and
        ties of friendship and good neighbourliness. But where these efforts
        fail, alternative sites will have to be found, and housing built. Long
        term steps should be taken to ensure that Gujarati society returns to
        its secular roots and to the tradition of its most revered son Mahatma
        Gandhi.</font></p>
