        original iconoclasts destroyed countless works of art. <i>Eikonoklastes</i>,
        the ancestor of our word, was first formed in Medieval Greek from the
        elements <i>eikon</i>, &quot;image, likeness,&quot; and <i>-klastes</i>,
        &quot;breaker,&quot; from <i>klan</i>, &quot;to break.&quot; The images
        referred to by the word are religious images, which were the subject of
        controversy among Christians of the Byzantine Empire in the 8th and 9th
        centuries, when iconoclasm was at its height. Those who opposed images
        did not, of course, simply destroy them, although many were demolished;
        they also attempted to have the images barred from display and
        veneration. During the Protestant Reformation images in churches were
        again felt to be idolatrous and were once more banned and destroyed. It
        is around this time that <i>iconoclast</i>, the descendant of the Greek
        word, is first recorded in English (1641), with reference to the Greek
        iconoclasts. In the 19th century <i>iconoclast</i> took on the secular
        sense that it has today, as in &quot;Kant was the great iconoclast&quot;

      time Narayan Gupta made his wish known to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>He badly wanted to write a short story based on the partition of
      Bengal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I gave my encouragement to
      such lofty ideas of his.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He wrote
      not a short story but quite a lengthy one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>We published his story 'Moina' in 6 parts sometime in 1999-2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>I lost many of his articles including the story of 'Moina' because

      </span>One time Narayan Gupta had this idea to write articles using
      animals a la <i>Aesop's Fables</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Thus,
      he created a whole bunch of characters out of uncastrated goats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>In Bengali, these animals conjure up images of stupidity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>Thus, Narayan Gupta was able to lampoon our modern-day society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>Indeed these are the fine examples of Swiftean satire ate its best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>Because of the acerbic tone of his lampoons, a section of the
      readers of NFB never quite had appreciated the geniuses of Narayan Gupta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>But the late writer could care less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>Before president Clinton made his maiden voyage to Bangladesh in
      March 2000, Narayan Gupta wrote an excellent article on what Clinton must
      see while visiting Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It
      was a wish list from him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He wrote
      the article using such evocative language that I forwarded the article to
      Dhaka's Daily Star.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Narayan Gupta's
      article was published before Clinton could arrive at Dhaka only for a day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

      </span>Because of his age, Narayan Gupta was better suited for debating
      with Bangalees of his generation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>With
      this view in mind, he used to write rebuttals against Prof. Rashiduzzaman's
      article.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Similarly, he often

      </span>Nonetheless, I talked to him few times over the phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>He had a deep and scratchy voice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He
      could speak three or four languages intermingling them as he wished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>I was amazed that he never did forget his Kishoreganji dialect!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>To make fun out of me, he used to address me as Baniachongi pola.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>My father originated from a village located next to Baniachong, a
      big village under Habiganj sub-division of Sylhet district.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>As a young boy, Narayan Gupta used to visit the small thana town of
      Ajmiriganj, a place not too far from Itna, the village he was born.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>He told me that Ajmiriganj was famous for <i>shutki</i>'the dry
      fish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is a marshy place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>Mr. Gupta said he would write an article based on what kind of
      water sport he saw in that no name place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Indeed,
      he wrote an article on age-old water sports of old Bengal based on his
      experience of visiting Ajmiriganj, which was re-published in NFB on May
      12, 2003, in his honor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p>

      am happy to learn that both NFB and Muktomona has decided to re-post
      Narayan Gupta's old articles to honor this iconoclast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>Narayan Gupta had a vision for his birthplace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>He wanted to see no communal strife between the dominating Muslims
      and the minority Hindus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He never
      considered himself a Hindu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He
      considered him as a human being and a son of the soil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
      </span>I think this is an understatement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Naryan
