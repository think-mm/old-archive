  <p>Dear All,</p>
  <p>I am not surprised hearing this sad news but I am deeply saddened. Yes, we
  should write articles, obituary, honoring this man. Is there any way you could
  ask his family members to get a photo of Narayan Gupta. It does not have to be
  recent picture. If his family could provide us a photo taken years ago, even
  then it will be good. Also, find out the exact date he breathed his last in
  Toronto. I have many recollection of his wit and humor and his combative mode
  in the NFB.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We all should write separate pieces remembering this enigmatic
  personality.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Dear All:</p>
  <p>It is a very sad news.</p>
  <p>Narayan da's departure from this mortal earth brings back lots of memories.
  First time I saw Narayan da's name was in News from Bangladesh. The year was
  1997. He used to write off and on in the Reader's Opinion column. In the good
  old Intellectual Collaborator Debate, <a href="http://cyber_bangla0.tripod.com/Debate/NFB.html">http://cyber_bangla0.tripod.com/Debate/NFB.html</a>&nbsp;
  you will find his comment as you scroll down.</p>
  <p>Narayan da and I used to have lots of telephonic conversation for some
  time. I encouraged him to send his essays to Jaffor bhai for further editing.
  Initially, that might have been hard for him to approach someone whom he
  barely knew. Later on, Jaffor bhai and Narayan da developed a closer
  intellectual bonding. Jaffor bhai also encouraged him to continue with his
  artistic endeavor. He was a great artist. Signs of his talent can still be
  found in paperstacks of Muktomona. He was a humorist and an excellent
  political cartoonist. Above all he was a great fighter who involved himself in
  all these creative work with a constant pain of cancer which was going up and
  down for some time. I recall onetime he recovered from a long dosage of
  chemotherapy and happily let us know he was enjoying to be on the computer key
  board.</p>
  <p>We do not see too many Bangalis of his age as courageous as Narayan da.</p>
  <p>It is so sad to know he is no more with us.</p>
  <p>I want to share my sorrow with you all.</p>
  <p>-<b>Jamal Hasan</b></p>

  <p>we should compile all his writings and archive them in the websites he used
  to write, like NFB, MM, eShomabesh, Nirvana. A photograph of NG should be
  posted in the opening page of this archive. We must keep his memory alive. Hre
  was a true secularist and was an inspiration for many including me.</p>

  <p>Dear All:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Passing away of Narayan Gupta is a tremendous loss for this cyber
  community. We never met but were very familier with each other's view. Two
  years or so back Hasan told me over a telephone conversation about his being
  admitted to a hospital in Canada. I sent him a happy recovery mail then. Since
  then his postings had gotten much reduced. He has left an indelible mark on
  the cyber space. It is a great loss for those who believe in a world where
  accident of birth should not be a hurdle. AND discrimination and oppression
  based on language, religion and caste should be consigned to dustbin of
  history. I join every one here to communicate my heart felt loss to his family
  and to each other, in this cyber family. Let fatemolla communicate our deep
  anguish and sorrow in person to his bereaved family, on our behalf if
  possible. We can call his family and express our solidarity and sense of loss
  if given the telephone number.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In solidarity,&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Dear All,</p>
  <p>It's a heart breaking news for me today. I never saw Narayan Da. I did not
  talk to him. But, I feel like I've lost someone so close to me. I was one of
  the many readers of his writings. I had a few e-mail communications with him.
  He was conscious and fully aware of the forces of bigotry. That's why he was
  quite active in writing against these vicious forces even though he was
  suffering from serious illness. I'm sure that he had a high level of spirit
  like a young man. I always observed that spirit in his essays. He has proved
  that he was young and energetic even in his 70s. We all will miss him. I
  express my deep respect for him.</p>
  <p>Jaffor Bhai, thank you for posting Narayan Da's essays. We should preserve
  his essays. As Kasem Bhai suggested, we should also think about archiving and
  compiling our essays.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
