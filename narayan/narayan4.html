      largest congregation of religious rituals is taking place right now in
      India. The actual site is the confluence of two mighty rivers Ganga and
      Jamuna (many spells as Yamuna or Jumna). In the days of Vedas, about 5000
      years ago, there was another river named Saraswati, which met at the same
      confluence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Therefore, the
      confluence is also called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Triveni
      Sangam</i> - the confluence of three braids.<o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
    geographical name of one of the holiest site of the Hindus was renamed by
    the Mughal Allahbad - the town of Allah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Before
    that, it was known as Prayag.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Since
    the decline of the Mughals,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the
    British reigned undivided India for over 150 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>After the country was divided and boundaries redrawn, based on the
    head counts of Hindus and Sikhs on one hand and the Muslims on the other,
    the town maintained its name after Islamic Supreme God Allah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>It also maintained a mix of Hindus with all the caste systems,
    Muslims and Sikhs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is also the
    seat of the High Court of the largest state of the Union, Uttar Pradesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>This city has produced many eminent persons of the subcontinent
    including the Nehrus.<o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
    inhabitants of the Indus and the Ganges valley have been worshipping river
    and seas from the Vedic times in various forms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The River Ganga is considered as Mother God to many.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Most of the religious sites of the Hindus are located on the banks of
    the Ganga, such as, Hrishikesh, Haridwar, Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>There are year round festivals and rituals in all such places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>These are either in the form of a Puja, holy dip, floating little
    lamps on leaves dedicated to the ancestors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I
    really do not see<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the special

    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">One
    of the big attraction of this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Mela</i>
    is the congregation of fully naked or half naked Sadhus' gathering by the
    thousands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>They come there from all
    over places - mostly Northern India and the slope of the Himalayas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>After the event, these Sadhus would return to their hermitage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>In the Purna Kumbha Mela of 1953, there was disturbance resulting in
    the stampede of the trident wielding Sadhus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>When it was all over, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Mela
    </i>authorities counted at least ten thousand devotees dead. What a tragedy
    at the site of the Holy God!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Skeptics
    lamented, people of other faiths ridiculed, faithful Hindus accepted the
    tragedy as a result of bad <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Karma</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Any way, what was supposed to be an event for receiving God's
    blessings turned out to be a killing field.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
    West Bengal and Bangladesh there are numerous festivals revolved around
    their rivers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>About this time, during
    the Makar Sankranti (Winter Solstice) there is a great congregation at the
    Sagar Island, off Sundarbans in the Bay of Bengal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Rabindranath's famous poem <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Devata</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">'</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">r
    Grash</i> is based on pilgrimage to the Sagar Island.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The obstinate boy wanted to accompany his aunt to the island. Jaibo
    Sagore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">'</span>I
    must go to the Sagar Island,' he was adamant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>In the end, to save other passengers of the boat from a certain
    wreck, the boy was sacrificed to the Ocean God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>With him went down the priest who led the pilgrims of the boat.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
    Bangladesh, these festivals are mainly practiced by the underclass Hindus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>One reason is that it is not expensive like the elaborate Durga Pujas
    of the so-called upper caste Hindus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In
    Mymensingh district, I remember people would travel to Hoshenpur on the bank
    of Old Brahmaputra river for dip on the occasion of Janmasthami - the birth
    day of Lord Krishna.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The event is
    commonly known as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Asthamir Snan</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Thousands take dip on Buriganga on that occasion, which if I recall
    correctly is an official holiday of Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>One of the festive seasons of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bhati</i>
    (low lying) areas of Kishoreganj, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Habiganj,
    Brahmanbaria is the during the mid monsoon month Sraban (July -August) when
    all the fields are flooded, the rivers and canals merge with the Haors
    (marshes) and harvesting was long over. The whole area celebrates during
    this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The festivals go by
    different names in different areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In
    some places it is called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Nouka </i>Puja,
    while in other areas it is known as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Srabani</i>
    Puja or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bisha Hari</i> Puja.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>As the names imply, the festival centers on the boat, the waterways
    and other traditions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Just as the
    rivers lose their separate identities with the onset of waters rushing from
    the slopes of the Meghalaya hills, so does the shades of Hindu-Muslim
    culture of the village folks. They probably return the pre-modern folk
    cultural days - having no relevance with the Hindu-Babu cultures or no
    conflict with the rural Muslim cultures of East Bengal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>The whole <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bhati</i> area takes
    a festive look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Everywhere there are
    hectic activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Friends visit
    friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Married daughters make long
    waited Journey to the parents home, the trip uniquely called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Nayyar</i>.
    <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Then,
    who worries about caste or faith?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It
    is a uniquely folk culture of the poor Bengal - rarely seen anywhere else in
    the sub-continent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Hindus join
    tobacco (often Ganja) smoking parties with Muslim friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Muslims are welcomed at the courtyards of Hindu farmers to share
    Pitha (rice cake) eating parties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I
    have even noticed Muslims singing folk songs on Lakhindar and Behula.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>These are the two legendary characters of rural East Bengal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>(When I say East Bengal, in this context it excludes the southern
    districts of Bangladesh like Jessore, Khulna and Pabna) but it includes
    Bangla-speaking areas of Assam such as, Karimganj and Silchar and even
    Tripura.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Then at night, there were
    informal session, mostly outdoor, of folk songs like Bhatiali, Jari Gaan,
    Shari Gaan, Marfati Gaan, and drum beating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Paan-Supari,
    Hookaha, Doi-ChiDa and often Ganja went freely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>But, one stark difference from such events of West Bengal was that
    there was no hanky-panky or alcohol or women related entertainment formed
    part of the festivities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Occasionally,
    the staff of the Zaminders or younger men of the Babu families were invited.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">There
    are no deities and rarely have I saw the participation of Brahmin Purohits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>These festivals have no relevance with the religious festivals of
    North India or West Bengal (like Gajan or Rathjatra).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>There are boat races participated by hundreds of boats and witnessed
    by many thousands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I have seen no one
    asking: Are you a Hindu or Muslim?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>On
    one such boat race festival at Ajmiriganj under the subdivision of Habiganj
    in the late forties, I saw not less than fifty thousand people came to see
    the boat race.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>All were seated on
    their boats of different styles, sizes and colors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Not too far was the famous village Baniachong, said to be most
    populated village of the United Bengal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It
    produced many eminent personalities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>One
    such person was Ramnath Das, who was the first person to travel the globe on
    a bicycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It is said that he wrote
    his diary in Sylheti dialect, which was translated in standard Bangla before
    reproduced in the Dainik Ananda Bazar Patrika of Calcutta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>On the way back to Itna (under Kishoreganj subdivision), our team had
    stopped at the village Joysidhdhi (home of Ananda Mohan Bose) and Mriga
    (home of Dr. Nihar Ranjan Ray of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Bangalir
    Itihash</i> fame).<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">When
    the festivals were going on, the traders did also brisk business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>At the Ajmiriganj Bajar, I noticed there were thousands of stalls
    selling almost anything that is needed for daily rural life - starting from
    thread for fishing net to Alta (decorative color for rural women's hand and
    foot).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>There were thousand of vendors
    displaying their myriad merchandise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>These
    included colorful Reshmi Churi (ceramic bangles), earthen pitchers, sugar
    candy, rice, cooking oil and even fresh fish. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">At
    the level of the educated class, rivers and water ways played a dominant
    part in Bangla literature, folk songs and folk cultures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Rabindranath's songs are heavily loaded with such things that are in
    daily life of riverine Bengal, such as boat, sail, southern wind, ebb-tide,
    waves, boat worker, flood,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>golden
    crops and harvest, ghat, white cloud, boat-wreck and on and on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>Like wise, Nazrul's famous song, Padma'r Dheu-re ....., would take
    anyone to his left-behind home in distant rural Bengal before one could
    finish humming the tune.<o:p>

    Naryan Gupta passed away sometime in the first week of May, 2003. He was
    about 68 years old at the time of his demise. He was born in Itna, Mymensing.
    His grandfather was the Zamindar of Itna. As a young boy he had vivid
    recollection of the partition of India and Pakistan. His memory was fresh as
    ever as far the Hindu-Mussulman riot od 1940s. We lost a great soul.</span></p>
