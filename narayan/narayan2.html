    Toronto Canada . Narayan Bhai was fighting cancer for sometime now, his
    courage and determination has been inspiration to so many of us.</font></p>
    <p>We at NFB join every one to communicate our heart felt loss to his family
    and to each other, in this cyber family. The sense of loss is hard to
    perceive, but he is still amongst all of us and will be so, all along.</p>
    <p>Many of us got to know him from News From Bangladesh pages, since1997. He
    has been major inspiration for NFB from it’s very beginning- along with Dr
    Jaffor Ullah , these were the handful few who started off the interactive
    elements for NFB- news monitoring site, whereby readers started contributing
    articles and opinion for NFB, now it is a regular feature for NFB . Even
    though he didn’t write much in very recent days, his legacy and
    contributions will continue, speaking up on the occasions was his style and
    who can forget such a person .</p>
    <p>He was not only exceptionally courageous, he used his writing to
    effectively to convince others of injustice and malice that is around us ,
    he stood for all of us without t being partial.</p>
    <p>I have never met him in person, yet I always felt that I know him and
    felt he was a dear one, we have exchanged many e mails and even argued on
    various issues , but my respect for him never hindered a bit , he surely was
    a man of honor and great dignity.</p>
    <p>Passing away of Narayan Bhai is a tremendous loss for the community.<font color="#0000ff"><b>&nbsp;
    </b></font>There were so many things this great man taught me, taught all of

    <p>O</font></b><font size="3">ne of the largest congregation of religious
    rituals is taking place right now in India. The actual site is the
    confluence of two mighty rivers Ganga and Jamuna (many spells as Yamuna or
    Jumna). In the days of Vedas, about 5000 years ago, there was another river
    named Saraswati, which met at the same confluence. Therefore, the confluence
    is also called <i>Triveni Sangam</i> - the confluence of three braids.</font></p>
    <p>The geographical name of one of the holiest site of the Hindus was
    renamed by the Mughal Allahbad - the town of Allah. Before that, it was
    known as Prayag. Since the decline of the Mughals, the British reigned
    undivided India for over 150 years. After the country was divided and
    boundaries redrawn, based on the head counts of Hindus and Sikhs on one hand
    and the Muslims on the other, the town maintained its name after Islamic
    Supreme God Allah. It also maintained a mix of Hindus with all the caste
    systems, Muslims and Sikhs. It is also the seat of the High Court of the
    largest state of the Union, Uttar Pradesh.&nbsp; This city has produced many
    eminent persons of the subcontinent including the Nehrus.</p>
    <p>The inhabitants of the Indus and the Ganges valley have been worshipping
    river and seas from the Vedic times in various forms. The River Ganga is
    considered as Mother God to many. Most of the religious sites of the Hindus
    are located on the banks of the Ganga, such as, Hrishikesh, Haridwar,
    Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna, etc. There are year round festivals and rituals
    in all such places. These are either in the form of a Puja, holy dip,
    floating little lamps on leaves dedicated to the ancestors. I really do not
    see the special significance the Kumbha Mela, except that every twelve year
    it has a special significance and is called Purna Ku! mbha meaning full
    pitcher. <i>Mela</i> means fair.</p>
    <p>One of the big attraction of this <i>Mela</i> is the congregation of
    fully naked or half naked Sadhus’ gathering by the thousands. They come
    there from all over places - mostly Northern India and the slope of the
    Himalayas. After the event, these Sadhus would return to their hermitage. In
    the Purna Kumbha Mela of 1953, there was disturbance resulting in the
    stampede of the trident wielding Sadhus. When it was all over, the <i>Mela </i>authorities
    counted at least ten thousand devotees dead. What a tragedy at the site of
    the Holy God! Skeptics lamented, people of other faiths ridiculed, faithful
    Hindus accept! ed the tragedy as a result of bad <i>Karma</i>. Any way, what
    was supposed to be an event for receiving God’s blessings turned out to be
    a killing field.</p>
    <p>In West Bengal and Bangladesh there are numerous festivals revolved
    around their rivers. About this time, during the Makar Sankranti (Winter
    Solstice) there is a great congregation at the Sagar Island, off Sundarbans
    in the Bay of Bengal. Rabindranath’s famous poem <i>Devata’r Grash</i>
    is based on pilgrimage to the Sagar Island. The obstinate boy wanted to
    accompany his aunt to the island. Jaibo Sagore. &quot;I must go to the Sagar
    Island,&quot; he was adamant. In the end, to save other passengers of the
    boat from a certain wreck, the boy was sacrificed to the Ocean God. With him
    went down the priest who led! the pilgrims of the boat.</p>
    <p>In Bangladesh, these festivals are mainly practiced by the underclass
    Hindus. One reason is that it is not expensive like the elaborate Durga
    Pujas of the so-called upper caste Hindus. In Mymensingh district, I
    remember people would travel to Hoshenpur on the bank of Old Brahmaputra
    river for dip on the occasion of Janmasthami - the birth day of Lord
    Krishna. The event is commonly known as <i>Asthamir Snan</i>. Thousands take
    dip on Buriganga on that occasion, which if I recall correctly is an
    official holiday of Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>One of the festive seasons of the <i>Bhati</i> (low lying) areas of
    Kishoreganj, Net! rokona, Sunamganj, Habiganj, Brahmanbaria is the during
    the mid monsoon month Sraban (July -August) when all the fields are flooded,
    the rivers and canals merge with the Haors (marshes) and harvesting was long
    over. The whole area celebrates during this time. The festivals go by
    different names in different areas.</p>
    <p>In some places it is called <i>Nouka </i>Puja, while in other areas it is
    known as <i>Srabani</i> Puja or <i>Bisha Hari</i> Puja. As the names imply,
    the festival centers on the boat, the waterways and other traditions. Just
    as the rivers lose their separate identities with the onset of waters
    rushing from the slopes of the Meghalaya hills, so does the shades of
    Hindu-Muslim culture! of the village folks. They probably return the
    pre-modern folk cultural days - having no relevance with the Hindu-Babu
    cultures or no conflict with the rural Muslim cultures of East Bengal. The
    whole <i>Bhati</i> area takes a festive look. Everywhere there are hectic
    activities. Friends visit friends. Married daughters make long waited
    Journey to the parents home, the trip uniquely called <i>Nayyar</i>.</p>
    <p>Then, who worries about caste or faith? It is a uniquely folk culture of
    the poor Bengal - rarely seen anywhere else in the sub-continent. Hindus
    join tobacco (often Ganja) smoking parties with Muslim friends. Muslims are
    welcomed at the courtyards of Hindu farmers to share Pitha (rice cake)
    eating parties. I have even noticed Muslims singing folk songs on Lakhindar
    and Behula. These are the two legendary characters of rural East Bengal.
    (When I say East Bengal, in this context it excludes the southern districts
    of Bangladesh like Jessore, Khulna and Pabna) but it includes Bangla-speaking
    areas of Assam such as, Karimganj and Silchar ! and even Tripura.). Then at
    night, there were informal session, mostly outdoor, of folk songs like
    Bhatiali, Jari Gaan, Shari Gaan, Marfati Gaan, and drum beating. Paan-Supari,
    Hookaha, Doi-ChiDa and often Ganja went freely. But, one stark difference
    from such events of West Bengal was that there was no hanky-panky or alcohol
    or women related entertainment formed part of the festivities. Occasionally,
    the staff of the Zaminders or younger men of the Babu families were invited.</p>
    <p>There are no deities and rarely have I saw the participation of Brahmin
    Purohits. These festivals have no relevance with the religious festivals of
    North India or West Bengal (like Gajan or Rathjatra). There are boat races
    participated by hundreds of boats and witnessed by many thousands. I have
    seen no one asking: Are you a Hindu or Muslim? On one such boat race
    festival at Ajmiriganj under the subdivision of Habiganj in the late
    forties, I saw not less than fifty thousand people came to see the boat
    race. All were seated on their boats of different styles, sizes and colors.</p>
    <p>Not too far was the famous village Baniachong, said to be m! ost
    populated village of the United Bengal. It produced many eminent
    personalities. One such person was Ramnath Das, who was the first person to
    travel the globe on a bicycle. It is said that he wrote his diary in Sylheti
    dialect, which was translated in standard Bangla before reproduced in the
    Dainik Ananda Bazar Patrika of Calcutta. On the way back to Itna (under
    Kishoreganj subdivision), our team had stopped at the village Joysidhdhi
    (home of Ananda Mohan Bose) and Mriga (home of Dr. Nihar Ranjan Ray of <i>Bangalir
    Itihash</i> fame).</p>
    <p>When the festivals were going on, the traders did also brisk business. At
    the Ajmiriganj Bajar, I noticed there were thousands of stalls selling
    almost anything that is needed for daily rural life - starting from thread
    for fishing net to Alta (decorative color for rural women’s hand and
    foot). There were thousand of vendors displaying their myriad merchandise.
    These included colorful Reshmi Churi (ceramic bangles), earthen pitchers,
    sugar candy, rice, cooking oil and even fresh fish.</p>
    <p>At the level of the educated class, rivers and water ways played a
    dominant part in Bangla literature, folk songs and folk cultures.
    Rabindranath’s songs are heavily loaded with such things that are in daily
    life of riverine Bengal, such as boat, sail, southern wind, ebb-tide, waves,
    boat worker, flood, golden crops and harvest, ghat, white cloud, boat-wreck
    and on and on. Like wise, Nazrul’s famous song, Padma’r Dheu-re .....,
    would take anyone to his left-behind home in distant rural Bengal before one
    could finish humming the tune.</p>
    <p>People of South Asia, Bengal in particular, have learnt long ago the
    value of water, which is the sole source of life, happiness and destiny of
    rural souls - men and women, rich and poor, Muslim and Hindu. All that is
    needed is the mind to appreciate and feel the gift of nature.</p>

      <p><font color="#0000FF">Narayan da's departure from this mortal world
      brings back lots of memories. First time I saw Narayan da's name was in
      News from Bangladesh. The year was 1997. He used to write off and on in
      the Reader's Opinion column. He also penned a small comment disclosing his
      position in the first emotionally charged debate of NFB back in 1997.
      Although his comment did not jibe with mine, I did not keep any hurt
      feeling towards him. That is why I reached out to him and cultivated a
      friendship towards a man of integrity who never hesitated to call Spade a
      Spade.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF">Narayan da and I used to have lots of telephonic
      conversation for some time. I encouraged him to send his essays to Dr.
      Jaffor Ullah for further editing. Initially, that might have been hard for
      him to approach someone whom he barely knew. It was fun to be the bridge
      between the two activists. Later on, Dr. Jaffor Ullah and Narayan da
      developed a closer intellectual bonding. Dr. Jaffor Ullah also encouraged
      him to continue with his artistic endeavor. He was a self-taught artist
      par excellence. Traces of his talent can still be found in paper stacks of
      Muktomona. He was also a humorist and an excellent political cartoonist.
      Above all, he was a great fighter who involved himself in all these
      creative work with a constant pain of cancer, which was going up and down
      for some time. I recall onetime he recovered from a long dosage of
      chemotherapy and he happily let us know that he was enjoying being on the
      computer keyboard once again. Normally we hardly come across too many
      Bangalis of his age as courageous as Narayan da.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF">I never met Narayan da in person. Yet, I always
      had felt that he was very close to me. Like many of the selfless political
      activists scattered around the globe, Narayan da will always remain very
      close to my heart and soul even though he is no longer with us anymore.</font></p>

      <p>SINCE Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Raja Rammohon Roy left the scene,
      very little progress had been noticed in condition of women in South Asian
      countries formerly known as the Indian subcontinent. Last one hundred or
      so years, the priorities amongst the bourgeoisie and western educated city
      dwelling Hindus of the subcontinent were initially to get Swaraj (self
      rule) first and then to achieve the social reform next. For the Muslim
      leadership had raised the demand for Pakistan a separate state for the
      Muslims of India first, everything else next. The Pan Asia Muslim
      consciousness was a primary product of self-imposed deprivation of western
      liberal ideas of the well-to-do section of the community. While the new
      rich Hindus sent their children to Oxford and Cambridge with a view of
      getting a good job under the British rulers. Many of them returned
      indoctrinated by the liberal thoughts of the European Socialists. During
      day time they studied Law or Engineering while on nights and weekends they
      attended radical India Majlish. The Muslim rich, baring a few, sent their
      boys to learn the intricacies of true Islam to Al-Azhar University of
      Cairo or such morbid institutions at home. However, when both the Swaraj
      and the Homeland for the Indian Muslims arrived suddenly, with very little
      or no price at all not counting the fratricidal killing of couple of
      millions and exodus of more millions the leaders of both India and
      Pakistan resumed the Mughal-Maratha conflict under a different name.</p>
      <p>One of the aspects of the subjugation on woman is trafficking smuggling
      out young girls from their impoverish homes to big cities inside or
      outside the borders and engage them in prostitution, sodomy and all other
      kinds of tortures, sometimes even outright murder. Oprah Winphrey, in one
      of recent (Jan 19, 2001) programmes highlighted the issue. The programme
      showed how every year among five to ten thousand minor girls are smuggled
      from villages of Kingdom of Nepal and brought to the red light areas of
      Mumbai and sold to the flesh traders. The fact of the matter is that
      little girls, call them children if you would, are often brought not only
      from Nepal, they are smuggled in from Bangladesh villages lured by the
      agents for better life. The agents collect the children from many parts of
      India where they are sold by their parents for as low as $200.</p>
      <p>Ophrah show focused that the slavery-torture on women goes openly in
      the Kamtapuri neighbourhood of Mumbai the clientele includes Petro-Dollar
      rich Sheikhs from the Arab countries. They fly straight to Santa-Cruz
      airport of Mumbai where the touts will be waiting for the services.
      Services include both &quot;eat-in&quot; and &quot;take-home.&quot; There
      are sufficient approval in the religious texts of the faithfuls of either
      shade that arrive in private. Before returning, these noble men do not
      forget to seek forgiveness (just in case) at the majestic Masjid off
      Mumbai beach. Zealot Hindus may be smiling and telling each other,
      &quot;Did I not tell you what they are like?&quot;</p>
      <p>Well, not so fast. Follow me to the most holy city of the Hindu
      Varanasi on the banks of the Ganges flowing north bound. Varanasi is also
      Beneras or Banaras or fabled city of Kashi - the oldest city inhabited
      continuously without a break. A city of many temples, large mosques,
      elegant churches, gurdwaras and Buddhist stupas (at Sarnath). The most
      famous is the Viswanath temple a small but ancient one, which survived
      many raids. This temple is the site of Lord Shiva.</p>
      <p>If you follow a typical businessman, you will notice that he has just
      arrived after taking a holy dip from the nearby Ganga. He enters the
      temple leaving his pair of shoes at the entrance of the temple, offers
      prayers in the prescribed manner, chants couple of Mantras, gives generous
      &quot;Dakshina&quot; (fees) to the priests and leaves the temple not
      forgetting his new pair of shoes. On the way back he trod the famous and
      narrowest lane, Biswantha Galli, there he buys some gifts and bunch of
      fresh roses. He looks around for any acquaintances and walks towards
      Godhuli intersection. There he comes across a dozen elderly ladies - all
      shaven heads and holding chains of beads - squatting on the side walk. One
      of them said in Bangla, &quot;Baba Amar, Ami Bangali Bidohaba, Chhele
      Bilatey Thakey, Sara Din Ekta Dana Pore Ni, Amake Kichhu Dao, Bhagaban
      Apnar Bhalo Korbey.&quot; He is in good spirit today, because he has just
      won a lucrative contract for repair of the retaining walls and the ghats
      of the city. He donated one full Rupee to each of the elderly widows.</p>
      <p>This not the end! If you have patience, please follow me little
      further. At the Godhuli, he hires a rickshaw. You hire another and follow
      him. Within five minutes he gets off and pays off the rickshaw puller and
      walks fast towards a narrow lane. From the signs of the nearby stores you
      come to know that this is the famous Dal Mandi where sex business is
      carried out for hundreds of years. You follow him. By then it is almost
      dark and you can watch the acts of welcoming the guests, the songs and the
      sweet smell of perfumes and flowers. A pleasant Gazal from a distant
      balcony touches your ears &quot;Job Dilko Fansaye Hum, Tere Saqui Sargam,&quot;
      literally, &quot;when I entangled my heart with you, it is your sweetheart
      who is having all the fun.&quot; That is enough for you and you return to
      your hotel on foot. Now is the time for laughter of the other guy,
      &quot;Ha - Ha - Ha, Dekha, Who Log Aur Bhi Gunhagar Hain!&quot;</p>
      <p>Next morning, out of your curiosity you decide to go to the spot where
      the Bengali widow was asking for alms. Bad luck, she is not there today.
      You ask the other lady in Bangla, &quot;Where is the other lady who was
      sitting next to you?&quot;</p>
      <p>Without paying much attention she mumbled, her only son is a surgeon at
      a London hospital but alas, could not afford to support the sick mother
      and then with shivering finger pointed towards not too distant shore of
      the Ganga. A plume of dark smoke was visible behind the city skyline. You
      walked to the cremation place right on the bank of the holy river. That is
      it. Dasashwamedh Ghat the cremation pyre that never had a break for
      several thousand years. The old widow has at last reached her eternal
      home. There, no problem of hospice, no medicare or pharmacare, no high
      health insurance problem or killer hospital bills, no anxiety for
      intellectual highly educated children torn between conscience and career
      or the <i>Antardwanda</i> (inner conflicts) about where the family
      boundary ends or where it begins.</p>
      <p>While you are carried away by stupid thoughts, the tidewaters washed
      off your sandals. It is time to say good buy grandma, let her atma (soul)
      find a resting place at long last. Too bad, both Vidyasagar and Rammohon
      are not there any more.</p>
