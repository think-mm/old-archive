				April 28, 2005 &nbsp;|&nbsp;</font> <!-- end default pre content  -->
				<font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3">Richard 
				Dawkins is the world's most famous out-of-the-closet living 
				atheist. He is also the world's most controversial evolutionary 
				biologist. Publication of his 1976 book, &quot;The Selfish Gene,&quot; 
				thrust Dawkins into the limelight as the handsome, irascible, 
				human face of scientific reductionism. The book provoked 
				everything from outrage to glee by arguing that natural 
				selection worked its creative powers only through genes, not 
				species or individuals. Humans are merely &quot;gene survival 
				machines,&quot; he asserted in the book. </p>
				<p align="justify">Dawkins stuck to his theme but expanded his 
				territory in such subsequent books as &quot;The Blind Watchmaker,&quot; 
				&quot;Unweaving the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Climbing Mount Improbable.&quot; His 
				recent work, &quot;The Ancestor's Tale,&quot; traces human lineage back 
				through time, stopping to ponder important forks in the 
				evolutionary road. </p>
				<p align="justify">Given his outspoken defense of Darwin, and 
				natural selection as the force of life, Dawkins has assumed a 
				new role: the religious right's Public Enemy No. 1. Yet Dawkins 
				doesn't shy from controversy, nor does he suffer fools gladly. 
				He recently met a minister who was on the opposite side of a 
				British political debate. When the minister put out his hand, 
				Dawkins kept his hands at his side and said, &quot;You, sir, are an 
				ignorant bigot.&quot;</p>
				<p align="justify">Currently, Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi 
				Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford 
				University, a position created for him in 1995 by Charles 
				Simonyi, a Microsoft millionaire. Earlier this year, Dawkins 
				signed an agreement with British television to make a 
				documentary about the destructive role of religion in modern 
				history, tentatively titled &quot;The Root of All Evil.&quot; </p>
				<p align="justify">I met Dawkins in late March at the Atheist 
				Alliance International annual conference in Los Angeles, where 
				he presented the alliance's top honor, the Richard Dawkins 
				Prize, to magicians Penn and Teller. During our conversation in 
				my hotel room, Dawkins was as gracious as he was punctiliously 
				dressed in a crisp white shirt and soft blazer. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Once again, evolution is under attack. Are 
				there any questions at all about its validity?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">It's often said that because evolution 
				happened in the past, and we didn't see it happen, there is no 
				direct evidence for it. That, of course, is nonsense. It's 
				rather like a detective coming on the scene of a crime, 
				obviously after the crime has been committed, and working out 
				what must have happened by looking at the clues that remain. In 
				the story of evolution, the clues are a billionfold. </p>
				<p align="justify">There are clues from the distribution of DNA 
				codes throughout the animal and plant kingdoms, of protein 
				sequences, of morphological characters that have been analyzed 
				in great detail. Everything fits with the idea that we have here 
				a simple branching tree. The distribution of species on islands 
				and continents throughout the world is exactly what you'd expect 
				if evolution was a fact. The distribution of fossils in space 
				and in time are exactly what you would expect if evolution were 
				a fact. There are millions of facts all pointing in the same 
				direction and no facts pointing in the wrong direction. </p>
				<p align="justify">British scientist J.B.S. Haldane, when asked 
				what would constitute evidence against evolution, famously said, 
				&quot;Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian.&quot; They've never been found. 
				Nothing like that has ever been found. Evolution could be 
				disproved by such facts. But all the fossils that have been 
				found are in the right place. Of course there are plenty of gaps 
				in the fossil record. There's nothing wrong with that. Why 
				shouldn't there be? We're lucky to have fossils at all. But no 
				fossils have been found in the wrong place, such as to disprove 
				the fact of evolution. Evolution is a fact. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Still, so many people resist believing in 
				evolution. Where does the resistance come from?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">It comes, I'm sorry to say, from religion. 
				And from bad religion. You won't find any opposition to the idea 
				of evolution among sophisticated, educated theologians. It comes 
				from an exceedingly retarded, primitive version of religion, 
				which unfortunately is at present undergoing an epidemic in the 
				United States. Not in Europe, not in Britain, but in the United 
				States. </p>
				<p align="justify">My American friends tell me that you are 
				slipping towards a theocratic Dark Age. Which is very 
				disagreeable for the very large number of educated, intelligent 
				and right-thinking people in America. Unfortunately, at present, 
				it's slightly outnumbered by the ignorant, uneducated people who 
				voted Bush in. </p>
				<p align="justify">But the broad direction of history is toward 
				enlightenment, and so I think that what America is going through 
				at the moment will prove to be a temporary reverse. I think 
				there is great hope for the future. My advice would be, Don't 
				despair, these things pass. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>You delve into agnosticism in &quot;The 
				Ancestor's Tale.&quot; How does it differ from atheism?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">It's said that the only rational stance is 
				agnosticism because you can neither prove nor disprove the 
				existence of the supernatural creator. I find that a weak 
				position. It is true that you can't disprove anything but you 
				can put a probability value on it. There's an infinite number of 
				things that you can't disprove: unicorns, werewolves, and 
				teapots in orbit around Mars. But we don't pay any heed to them 
				unless there is some positive reason to think that they do 
				exist. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Believing in God is like believing in a 
				teapot orbiting Mars?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">Yes. For a long time it seemed clear to just 
				about everybody that the beauty and elegance of the world seemed 
				to be prima facie evidence for a divine creator. But the 
				philosopher David Hume already realized three centuries ago that 
				this was a bad argument. It leads to an infinite regression. You 
				can't statistically explain improbable things like living 
				creatures by saying that they must have been designed because 
				you're still left to explain the designer, who must be, if 
				anything, an even more statistically improbable and elegant 
				thing. Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. 
				It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is 
				explained by a designer but that's because the designer himself, 
				the engineer, is explained by natural selection. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Those who embrace &quot;intelligent design&quot; -- 
				the idea that living cells are too complex to have been created 
				by nature alone -- say evolution isn't incompatible with the 
				existence of God.</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">There is just no evidence for the existence 
				of God. Evolution by natural selection is a process that works 
				up from simple beginnings, and simple beginnings are easy to 
				explain. The engineer or any other living thing is difficult to 
				explain -- but it is explicable by evolution by natural 
				selection. So the relevance of evolutionary biology to atheism 
				is that evolutionary biology gives us the only known mechanism 
				whereby the illusion of design, or apparent design, could ever 
				come into the universe anywhere. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>So why do we insist on believing in God?</b>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">From a biological point of view, there are 
				lots of different theories about why we have this extraordinary 
				predisposition to believe in supernatural things. One suggestion 
				is that the child mind is, for very good Darwinian reasons, 
				susceptible to infection the same way a computer is. In order to 
				be useful, a computer has to be programmable, to obey whatever 
				it's told to do. That automatically makes it vulnerable to 
				computer viruses, which are programs that say, &quot;Spread me, copy 
				me, pass me on.&quot; Once a viral program gets started, there is 
				nothing to stop it. </p>
				<p align="justify">Similarly, the child brain is preprogrammed 
				by natural selection to obey and believe what parents and other 
				adults tell it. In general, it's a good thing that child brains 
				should be susceptible to being taught what to do and what to 
				believe by adults. But this necessarily carries the down side 
				that bad ideas, useless ideas, waste of time ideas like rain 
				dances and other religious customs, will also be passed down the 
				generations. The child brain is very susceptible to this kind of 
				infection. And it also spreads sideways by cross infection when 
				a charismatic preacher goes around infecting new minds that were 
				previously uninfected. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>You've said that raising children in a 
				religious tradition may even be a form of abuse.</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">What I think may be abuse is labeling 
				children with religious labels like Catholic child and Muslim 
				child. I find it very odd that in our civilization we're quite 
				happy to speak of a Catholic child that is 4 years old or a 
				Muslim of child that is 4, when these children are much too 
				young to know what they think about the cosmos, life and 
				morality. We wouldn't dream of speaking of a Keynesian child or 
				a Marxist child. And yet, for some reason we make a privileged 
				exception of religion. And, by the way, I think it would also be 
				abuse to talk about an atheist child. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>You are working on a new book tentatively 
				called &quot;The God Delusion.&quot; Can you explain it?</b></p>
				<p align="justify">A delusion is something that people believe 
				in despite a total lack of evidence. Religion is scarcely 
				distinguishable from childhood delusions like the &quot;imaginary 
				friend&quot; and the bogeyman under the bed. Unfortunately, the God 
				delusion possesses adults, and not just a minority of 
				unfortunates in an asylum. The word &quot;delusion&quot; also carries 
				negative connotations, and religion has plenty of those. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>What are its negative connotations?</b>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">A delusion that encourages belief where there 
				is no evidence is asking for trouble. Disagreements between 
				incompatible beliefs cannot be settled by reasoned argument 
				because reasoned argument is drummed out of those trained in 
				religion from the cradle. Instead, disagreements are settled by 
				other means which, in extreme cases, inevitably become violent. 
				Scientists disagree among themselves but they never fight over 
				their disagreements. They argue about evidence or go out and 
				seek new evidence. Much the same is true of philosophers, 
				historians and literary critics. </p>
				<p align="justify">But you don't do that if you just know your 
				holy book is the God-written truth and the other guy knows that 
				his incompatible scripture is too. People brought up to believe 
				in faith and private revelation cannot be persuaded by evidence 
				to change their minds. No wonder religious zealots throughout 
				history have resorted to torture and execution, to crusades and 
				jihads, to holy wars and purges and pogroms, to the Inquisition 
				and the burning of witches. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>What are the dark sides of religion today?</b>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">Terrorism in the Middle East, militant 
				Zionism, 9/11, the Northern Ireland &quot;troubles,&quot; genocide, which 
				turns out to be &quot;credicide&quot; in Yugoslavia, the subversion of 
				American science education, oppression of women in Saudi Arabia, 
				Afghanistan, and the Roman Catholic Church, which thinks you 
				can't be a valid priest without testicles. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Fifty years ago, philosophers like 
				Bertrand Russell felt that the religious worldview would fade as 
				science and reason emerged. Why hasn't it?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">That trend toward enlightenment has indeed 
				continued in Europe and Britain. It just has not continued in 
				the U.S., and not in the Islamic world. We're seeing a rather 
				unholy alliance between the burgeoning theocracy in the U.S. and 
				its allies, the theocrats in the Islamic world. They are 
				fighting the same battle: Christian on one side, Muslim on the 
				other. The very large numbers of people in the United States and 
				in Europe who don't subscribe to that worldview are caught in 
				the middle. </p>
				<p align="justify">Actually, holy alliance would be a better 
				phrase. Bush and bin Laden are really on the same side: the side 
				of faith and violence against the side of reason and discussion. 
				Both have implacable faith that they are right and the other is 
				evil. Each believes that when he dies he is going to heaven. 
				Each believes that if he could kill the other, his path to 
				paradise in the next world would be even swifter. The delusional 
				&quot;next world&quot; is welcome to both of them. This world would be a 
				much better place without either of them. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Does religion contribute to the violence 
				of Islamic extremists? Christian extremists?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">Of course it does. From the cradle, they are 
				brought up to revere martyrs and to believe they have a fast 
				track to heaven. With their mother's milk they imbibe hatred of 
				heretics, apostates and followers of rival faiths. </p>
				<p align="justify">I don't wish to suggest it is doctrinal 
				disputes that are motivating the individual soldiers who are 
				doing the killing. What I do suggest is that in places like 
				Northern Ireland, religion was the only available label by which 
				people could indulge in the human weakness for us-or-them wars. 
				When a Protestant murders a Catholic or a Catholic murders a 
				Protestant, they're not playing out doctrinal disagreements 
				about transubstantiation. </p>
				<p align="justify">What is going on is more like a vendetta. It 
				was one of their lot's grandfathers who killed one of our lot's 
				grandfathers, and so we're getting our revenge. The &quot;their lot&quot; 
				and &quot;our lot&quot; is only defined by religion. In other parts of the 
				world it might be defined by color, or by language, but in so 
				many parts of the world it isn't, it's defined by religion. 
				That's true of the conflicts among Croats and the Serbs and 
				Bosnians -- that's all about religion as labels. </p>
				<p align="justify">The grotesque massacres in India at the time 
				of partition were between Hindus and Muslims. There was nothing 
				else to distinguish them, they were racially the same. They only 
				identified themselves as &quot;us&quot; and the others as &quot;them&quot; by the 
				fact that some of them were Hindus and some of them were 
				Muslims. That's what the Kashmir dispute is all about. So, yes, 
				I would defend the view that religion is an extremely potent 
				label for hostility. That has always been true and it continues 
				to be true to this day. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>How would we be better off without 
				religion?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">We'd all be freed to concentrate on the only 
				life we are ever going to have. We'd be free to exult in the 
				privilege -- the remarkable good fortune -- that each one of us 
				enjoys through having been being born. An astronomically 
				overwhelming majority of the people who could be born never will 
				be. You are one of the tiny minority whose number came up. Be 
				thankful that you have a life, and forsake your vain and 
				presumptuous desire for a second one. The world would be a 
				better place if we all had this positive attitude to life. It 
				would also be a better place if morality was all about doing 
				good to others and refraining from hurting them, rather than 
				religion's morbid obsession with private sin and the evils of 
				sexual enjoyment. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Are there environmental costs of a 
				religious worldview?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">There are many religious points of view where 
				the conservation of the world is just as important as it is to 
				scientists. But there are certain religious points of view where 
				it is not. In those apocalyptic religions, people actually 
				believe that because they read some dopey prophesy in the book 
				of Revelation, the world is going to come to an end some time 
				soon. People who believe that say, &quot;We don't need to bother 
				about conserving forests or anything else because the end of the 
				world is coming anyway.&quot; A few decades ago one would simply have 
				laughed at that. Today you can't laugh. These people are in 
				power. </p>
				</font>
				<p align="justify">
				<font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3"><b>Unlike 
				other accounts of the evolution of life, &quot;The Ancestor's Tale&quot; 
				starts at the present and works back. Why did you decide to tell 
				the story in reverse?</b> </font></p>
				<p align="justify">
				<font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3">The most 
				important reason is that if you tell the evolution story 
				forwards and end up with humans, as it's humanly normal to do so 
				because people are interested in themselves, it makes it look as 
				though the whole of evolution were somehow aimed at humanity, 
				which of course it wasn't. One could aim anywhere, like at 
				kangaroos, butterflies or frogs. We're all contemporary 
				culmination points, for the moment, in evolution. </font></p>
				<p align="justify">
				<font face="times new roman, times, serif" size="3">If you go 
				backward, however, no matter where you start in this huge tree 
				of life, you always converge at the same point, which is the 
				origin of life. So that was the main reason for structuring the 
				book the way I did. It gave me a natural goal to head toward -- 
				the origin of life -- no matter where I started from. Then I 
				could legitimately start with humans, which people are 
				interested in. </p>
				<p align="justify">People like to trace their ancestry. One of 
				the most common types of Web sites, after ones about sex, is 
				one's family history. When people trace the ancestry of that 
				name, they normally stop at a few hundred years. I wanted to go 
				back 4,000 million years. </p>
				<p align="justify">The idea of going back towards a particular 
				goal called to my mind the notion of pilgrimage as a kind of 
				literary device. So I very vaguely modeled the book on Chaucer's 
				&quot;Canterbury Tales,&quot; where the pilgrims start off as a band of 
				human pilgrims walking backward to discover our ancestors. We 
				are successively joined by other pilgrims -- the chimpanzee 
				pilgrims at 5 million years, then the gorilla pilgrims, then the 
				orangutan pilgrims. Starting with humans, there are only about 
				39 such rendezvous points as you go back in time. It's a rather 
				surprising fact. Rendezvous 39 is where we meet the bacteria 
				pilgrims. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>The idea that evolution could be &quot;random&quot; 
				seems to frighten people. Is it random?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">This is a spectacular misunderstanding. If it 
				was random, then of course it couldn't possibly have given rise 
				to the fantastically complicated and elegant forms that we see. 
				Natural selection is the important force that drives evolution. 
				Natural selection is about as non-random a force as you could 
				possibly imagine. It can't work unless there is some sort of 
				variation upon which to work. And the source of variation is 
				mutation. Mutation is random only in the sense that it is not 
				directed specifically toward improvement. It is natural 
				selection that directs evolution toward improvement. Mutation is 
				random in that it's not directed toward improvement. </p>
				<p align="justify">The idea that evolution itself is a random 
				process is a most extraordinary travesty. I wonder if it's 
				deliberately put about maliciously or whether these people 
				honestly believe such a preposterous absurdity. Of course 
				evolution isn't random. It is driven by natural selection, which 
				is a highly non-random force. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Is there an emotional side to the 
				intellectual enterprise of exploring the story of life on Earth?</b>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">Yes, I strongly feel that. When you meet a 
				scientist who calls himself or herself religious, you'll often 
				find that that's what they mean. You often find that by 
				&quot;religious&quot; they do not mean anything supernatural. They mean 
				precisely the kind of emotional response to the natural world 
				that you've described. Einstein had it very strongly. 
				Unfortunately, he used the word &quot;God&quot; to describe it, which has 
				led to a great deal of misunderstanding. But Einstein had that 
				feeling, I have that feeling, you'll find it in the writings of 
				many scientists. It's a kind of quasi-religious feeling. And 
				there are those who wish to call it religious and who therefore 
				are annoyed when a scientist calls himself an atheist. They 
				think, &quot;No, you believe in this transcendental feeling, you 
				can't be an atheist.&quot; That's a confusion of language. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Some scientists say that removing religion 
				or God from their life would leave it meaningless, that it's God 
				that gives meaning to life.</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">&quot;Unweaving the Rainbow&quot; specifically attacks 
				the idea that a materialist, mechanist, naturalistic worldview 
				makes life seem meaningless. Quite the contrary, the scientific 
				worldview is a poetic worldview, it is almost a transcendental 
				worldview. We are amazingly privileged to be born at all and to 
				be granted a few decades -- before we die forever -- in which we 
				can understand, appreciate and enjoy the universe. And those of 
				us fortunate enough to be living today are even more privileged 
				than those of earlier times. We have the benefit of those 
				earlier centuries of scientific exploration. Through no talent 
				of our own, we have the privilege of knowing far more than past 
				centuries. Aristotle would be blown away by what any schoolchild 
				could tell him today. That's the kind of privileged century in 
				which we live. That's what gives my life meaning. And the fact 
				that my life is finite, and that it's the only life I've got, 
				makes me all the more eager to get up each morning and set about 
				the business of understanding more about the world into which I 
				am so privileged to have been born. </p>
				<p align="justify"><b>Humans may not be products of an 
				intelligent designer but given genetic technologies, our 
				descendants will be. What does this mean about the future of 
				evolution?</b> </p>
				<p align="justify">It's an interesting thought that in some 
				remote time in the future, people may look back on the 20th and 
				21st centuries as a watershed in evolution -- the time when 
				evolution stopped being an undirected force and became a design 
				force. Already, for the past few centuries, maybe even 
				millennia, agriculturalists have in a sense designed the 
				evolution of domestic animals like pigs and cows and chickens. 
				That's increasing and we're getting more technologically clever 
				at that by manipulating not just the selection part of evolution 
				but also the mutation part. That will be very different; one of 
				the great features of biological evolution up to now is that 
				there is no foresight. </p>
				<p align="justify">In general, evolution is a blind process. 
				That's why I called my book &quot;The Blind Watchmaker.&quot; Evolution 
				never looks to the future. It never governs what happens now on 
				the basis on what will happen in the future in the way that 
				human design undoubtedly does. But now it is possible to breed a 
				new kind of pig, or chicken, which has such and such qualities. 
				We may even have to pass that pig through a stage where it is 
				actually less good at whatever we want to produce -- making long 
				bacon racks or something -- but we can persist because we know 
				it'll be worth it in the long run. That never happened in 
				natural evolution; there was never a &quot;let's temporarily get 
				worse in order to get better, let's go down into the valley in 
				order to get over to the other side and up onto the opposite 
				mountain.&quot; So yes, I think it well may be that we're living in a 
				time when evolution is suddenly starting to become intelligently 
				designed. </p>
