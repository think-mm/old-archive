	&quot;no&quot;. However, a believer's mind&nbsp; does not work in such a way. A 
	believer like Mohiuddin suffers from a &quot;True-believer syndrome&quot; which is&nbsp;

	would consider following &quot;Natural Flukes&quot; as &quot;signature of God&quot; as well.&nbsp; 
	For example, one may ask, what will be his answer if one devout Hindu

	<font face="Verdana">Obviously, this time Mr. Mohiuddin will act like other 
	rational beings and will be able to understand that &quot;Flukes do happen&quot;. The 
	reason is obvious; those pictures do not bear the name of Allah the Islamic 
	God, but the waves of Tsunami does! This leads us to conclude that Mr. 
	Mohiuddin and his Muslim brothers who believe in &quot;Islamic miracles&quot; could 
	not actually come out from their <i>confirmation bias</i>!&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	(Confirmation bias refers to a type of selective thinking whereby one tends

	<font face="Verdana">So, why do people believe weird things? Of course, <i>
	Ignorance </i>can be the main reason many people believe &quot;such crap&quot;. 
	Religion, myths, superstitions, cults, New Age ideas, and all sort of 
	nonsense miracles have been presented every nook and cranny of both popular 
	and high culture year after year. So, even in this age of science, most 
	people are unaware the real scientific facts behind &quot;Barmuda Triangle&quot;, 
	&quot;psychokinesis&quot; or &quot;Nostradamus story&quot;. According to recent polls, in US about 
	82 percent are convinced of the reality of heaven (and 63 percent think 
	they're headed there after death); 51 percent believe in ghosts; but only 28 
	percent are swayed by the theory of evolution. Ignorance is really a bliss 
	here. Besides this, &quot;more than any other, the reason people believe weird 
	things,&quot; says Michael Shermer, in defining the term <i>Credo Consolans</i> 
	in&nbsp; his book &quot;Why people Believe Weird Things&quot;&nbsp; -&nbsp; &quot;is 
	because they want to. . . .It feels good. It is comforting. It is 
	consoling.&quot; Secondly, weird beliefs offer &quot;<i>immediate gratification</i>.&quot; 
	People like weird beliefs because they are simple. Weird beliefs also 
	satisfy the quest for significance: they satisfy our <i>moral needs</i> and 
	our desire that life be meaningful. Finally, he says, people believe weird 
	things because weird things give them <i>hope</i> (<font size="2">Michael Shermer, Why 
	People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other

	<font face="Verdana">Our forum moderator Jahed Ahmed showed his profound 
	astonishment by the &quot;gullible tendency&quot; of seemingly educated Muslims like 
	Mr. Mohiuddin. Again, Mr. Mohiuddin is not alone in his credulous journey. 
	One can cite examples of William Dembski, Philip Johnson, Hugh Ross, Michael 
	Behe, Frank Tipler. By the criteria that counts in the academy (for 
	publishing papers in journals, books etc) they are really smart. one can 
	ponder why would someone with such talent surrenders to gullibility of 
	&quot;intelligent design&quot;, &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;, &quot;anthropic principle&quot;, &quot;fine 
	tuning&quot; etc and at the end chasing the chimera of proving what is inherently 
	improvable- God?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also we have seen, many &quot;smart people&quot; are 
	overconfident enough to think that if they cannot explain something, it must 
	be inexplicable and therefore a true mystery of the paranormal. let us 
	consider our friend Dr. Ali Sina who wrote an article &quot;</font><b><font style="LINE-HEIGHT: 1.35em" color="#000080" face="Verdana"><a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina40226.htm">What 
	it Takes to be a Rationalist</a></font></b><font face="Verdana">&quot; on the 
	occasion of celebration of &quot;Rationalists' Day&quot; where he told us 
	about how he was 
	overwhelmed by a globe of orange light near hovering over his sleeping 
	sister.&nbsp; Brent Meeker, a fellow skeptic put a rational explanation of Sina's miracle in his article, &quot;<b><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/rationalist_day/rationalism_meeker.html">Dogmatism 
	of the Paranormalist</a></b>&quot;, explaining: &quot;Had he (Ali Sina) spent even a 
	few minutes searching the literature he would have found that a globe of 
	orange light is what ball lightning looks like. It often moves swiftly after 
	hovering.&quot; However, Ali objected to Brent's explanation of the orange globe 
	of light in his later article because he believed it 'behaved 
	intelligently'. If he could think critically as he does in debunking Islamic 
	myths, he could have searched more rather just sticking in paranormal 
	explanation. I consider Dr. Ali Sina as one of the leading scholars debunking 
	Islamic myths and I always try to maintain a friendly relationship with him, 
	yet I critique some of Ali's ideas regarding paranormal issues in some of my 
	previous articles. For example, Ali Sina wanted to believe in Van Praagh's 
	psychic power without critically examining it.&nbsp; It can be very possible 
	that Ali does not have any expertise in such field like Randi or Shermer 
	have. 
	Yet, his overconfident mind declares Van Praagh as a psychic. An amateur 
	archeologist, in the same way,&nbsp; declares that because he cannot figure 
	out how the pyramids were built, they must have been constructed by space 
	aliens. Even those who are more reasonable at least think that if the 
	experts cannot explain something, it must be inexplicable. Feats such as the 
	bending of spoons, firewalking, or mental telepathy are often thought to be 
	of a paranormal or mystical nature because most people either cannot explain 
	them. When they are explained, most people respond, &quot;Yes, of course&quot; or 
	&quot;That's obvious once you see it.&quot; Firewalking can be a case in point. People 
	used to speculate endlessly about supernatural powers over pain and heat, or 
	mysterious brain chemicals that block the pain and prevent burning. The 
	simple explanation is that the capacity of light and fluffy coals to contain 
	heat is very low, and the conductivity of heat from the light and fluffy 
	coals to your feet is very poor. As long as you don't stand around on the 
	coals, you will not get burned.&nbsp; Also it takes few minutes or so for getting 
	our skin burnt in a particular heat, the atmosphere i.e. the breeze, 
	coolness, and the dampness. Sometimes a trick is deliberately done to put rock salt on 
	the hot coal bed which attracts moisture and so it restricts sudden burn if 
	one walks within 3 seconds. Another factor should not also be overlooked which is generally done in places of 
	worship is that the religious gurus wash their feet and body with lots of 
	water in front of the hot coal bed and goes around the hot bed praying many 
	times when their feet get a coating of wet clay and until the water in the 
	clay gets evaporated, they won't get burnt.
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/new_site/mukto-mona/muk-rationalism.html">
	Mukto-Mona Rationalism page</a> contains some articles with rational 
	explanation of such &quot;alleged miracles&quot;; the following article can be of

	<font face="Verdana">Again, There can be many genuine unsolved mysteries, 
	and infact there are (for example knowledge about dark matter, dark energy, 
	conceptualization of eleven dimension in string theory and many others are 
	still mystery) and it is completely okay for us to say, &quot;We haven't yet 
	solved all but 
	someday perhaps we will.&quot; The problem is that most of us find it more 
	comforting to have certainty, even if it is premature or absurd, than to 
	live with unsolved or unexplained mysteries. </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">Skepticism or debunking, according to Stephen Jay 
	Gould, often receives the bad rap reserved for activities - like garbage 
	disposal - that obviously must be done for a safe and sane life, but seem 
	either unglamorous or unworthy of overt celebration. Yet the activity has a 
	noble tradition, from the ancient Charvakas and Greek coinage of &quot;skeptic&quot; 
	to Carl Sagan, Victor Stenger, Mark perakh, Paul Kurtz, Maichael Shermer, 
	James Randi and Prabir Ghosh's work.&nbsp; This trend should be carried on. I would 
	like to end my piece by quoting Natalie Angier: </font></p>

		believe in life after death, but I'd like to believe in life before
