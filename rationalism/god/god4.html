  <p>I </b></font>will leave it to the readers to do their own psycho-analysis
  as to what can cause one to pass such personal bitter remarks above when
  trying to refute an otherwise impersonal opinion on science and metaphysics. I
  hope they will also agree it may not be worth engaging in a dialog with
  someone resorting to such ad hominems. So I will instead present some further
  clarifications for the benefit of general readers in case I had been remiss in
  making my points precise earlier.</p>
  <p>Regarding the fine tuning argument, It was a strawman fallacy of misquoting
  me that I denied its existence. I NEVER SAID that ther IS NO finetuning in the
  universe. I made the point that such finetuning has plausible
  natural(scientific) explanation and thet it is a fallacy to insist that only a
  divine intervention can explain such a finetuning. Finetuning does not
  necessarily need a divine explanation. Many scientists have indeed shown that
  finetuning can have natural explananation. I gave a link to one such
  explanation by Physicist Victor Stenger. Here are some some more sources on
  this issue:</p>
  <b>
  <p>Noble Laureate Physicist Steven Weinberg on Intelligent Design:</p>
  </b>
  <p><a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/archive/design/weinberg_designer.html">http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/archive/design/weinberg_designer.html</a></p>

  <p><a href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~vstenger/Cosmo/FineTune.pdf">http://spot.colorado.edu/~vstenger/Cosmo/FineTune.pdf</a></p>
  <p>Vic Stenger has also written a book:</p>
  <p>Not By Design: The Origin of the Universe</p>
  <p>We are yet to see any Scientist making a claim BASED ON SCIENCE that
  finetuning can only be explained by invoking God. Even if there was no
  (although I re-emphasize that there IS) scientific explanation of finetuning,
  it will still be premature and unscientific to jump to a divine
  &quot;explanation&quot;. That&nbsp; is exactly what is known as&nbsp;
  &quot;Argumentum Ad Ignorantum&quot; in logic. It is like explaining eclipses
  by invoking God when celestial mechanics (Newtonian mechanics) was unknown to
  humans, or thunders being explained as acts of God when electricty was unknown
  to humans.</p>
  <p>Secondly I maintain that there is no causality at the microspcopic level.
  It only exists at the macroscopic level. Causality requires directionality of
  time. Time is also an emergent concept. At the fundamental level, there is no
  special direction of time. There is no notion of past or future in any
  elementary particle process.</p>
  <p>All fundamental equations are symmetric in time. Virtual pair production is
  not a causal process in time. The energy needed to produce a virtual pair is a
  contraint imposed by Physics, not a cause. The energy (due to vacuum
  fluctuation from Uncertainty principle) ALLOWS (does not CAUSE)&nbsp; a pair
  production. Vacuum pair production is inherently a chance event.</p>
  <p>Finally, regarding the allegation that I tried to prove the non-existence
  of God, the unambiguous answer is that nobody can either prove or disprove the
  existence of God as much as no one can prove or disprove that unicorns exist
  somewhere in the universe. Proving or disproving the intangible and undefined
  is not within the realm of science. Science is about the empirical. Something
  like God, that is not empirical, i.e not subject to observations, either
  directly through ordinary sense perception or indirectly by sophisticated
  scientific tools of detection, can never be claimed to exists or NOT to exist
  by any logic.</p>
  <p>One can only have faith in the existence of such an imagined entity. Since
  science deals with empirical notions based on observational evidence through
  logical process, God can never be proven by scientific method. The existence
  of God can only be claimed by faith alone. Although science and rationality
  cannot prove or disprove the existence of God, science and logic can be used
  to decide if&nbsp; the arguments used to PROVE the existence of God is
  scientific and logical.</p>
  <p>It is not too subtle to comprehend that:</p>
  <b>
  <p>&quot;Refuting an argument claiming to prove the existence God&quot;</p>
  </b>
  <p>IS NOT = &quot;Proving the non-existence of God&quot;.</p>
  <p>And it is the Left hand side of the above inequality that my earlier post
  was all about.</p>
  <p>I would urge the readers who still may be confused about finetuning and
  causality to consult a reputable professional particle physicist or
  cosmologist to settle these two issues, instead of settling it here in NFB by
  reading angry personal remarks of one calling another an &quot;imposter&quot;,
  &quot;unscrupulous&quot;, &quot;dishonest&quot;, accusing him of
  &quot;fooling&quot; the readers (I can understand if any reader feels insulted
  at the hint that he/she can be fooled) others etc. Those are not credible
  (neither civilized) ways to settle philosophical or academic questions.</p>
  <b>
  <p>The two moot questions are:
  <dir>
  </b>
  <p>1. (a) Can finetuning be explained by any natural/physical explanation at
  all? (b) Does physics need to invoke only God to &quot;explain&quot;
  finetuning?</p>
  <p>2. Does cause and effect have an unambiguous meaning at the fundamental
  quantum level of elementary particles like it has at the level of ordinary
  experience of macroscopic world?</p>
  </dir>
  <p>My answer is YES for 1(a), NO for 1(b), NO for 2.</p>
  <p>If the answers I provided are correct, then essentially the finetuning
  argument for God becomes a faith (or pseudoscience), not science. Let the
  readers find out on their own, although I have provided credible enmough
  references and soucess that corroborate my position.

  <p>T</b></font>his is not about the Physics of Mr. Zaman’s and Mr A.
  Iqbal’s postings. It is about their inner self that shows up in the style of
  presentation. We are produces of teachers who taught subjects in the classroom
  and lessons of life beyond classrooms. For that they had to have a
  teacher-personality, not to punish but to correct.</p>
  <p>Days changed, so did value, as is reflected in the posting about God and
  science in yesterday’s NFB. What could be a decent discussion turned to a
  venomous snakebite. We got a &quot;not-so-decent&quot; posting from a teacher
  of a &quot;decent University&quot;. For n’th time it is proven that people
  can be good or bad with or without God, but it takes god to lead a teacher to
  ill manners.</p>
  <p>God’s existence is probably the finest and most sophisticated challenge
  to human faculties. Apart from personal conviction, mankind’s last word
  about it is far off. Until then, let us discuss with civility and leave the
  realization of God’s existence to bloom from within.</p>
  <p>While somebody’s science may well prove God’s existence, many other
  scientific approaches prove His non-existence with equal, if not more,
  efficiency. Kobiguru’s (Tagore) vision about it is extremely valuable, but I
  refrain from quoting him, as that will make it longer.</p>

    <li>&quot;Mr. Zaman is improperly trying to apply the ergodic theorem

      understand the decency-line. Expectation of civility from an univ. Teacher
      is only natural.</font>
    <li>&quot;But please understand the nature of people like Mr. Zaman. They

    <p>Audacious expression, absolutely unacceptable . <u><b>We must not use
    such mean words even if someone is incorrect</b></u>. Judgemental /
    absolutist- attitude is at the root of many nasty problems of life. I am
    sorry but after such expressions &quot;assalamu alaykum&quot; becomes a
    meaningless joke.</p>
