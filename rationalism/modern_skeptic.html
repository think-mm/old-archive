	Believing in the great unbeliever<br>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In line to get my badge for this 
	year's skeptics conference in Pasadena, Calif., I recognized the little man 
	standing behind me. He was bald, with a full, white beard, and he looked 
	older than I would have imagined. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; he said, &quot;is this the line 
	for the skeptics meeting?&quot; When I nodded, he looked me up and down and 
	replied, &quot;Oh, I doubt that.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ladies and gentlemen, meet the 
	world's most famous skeptic, the
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rodneyanonymous.com/archives/randi.jpg">
	Amazing Randi</a>.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was in the seventh grade when I 
	first came across <i>
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0879751983/102-6661794-6428962?v=glance">
	Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions</a></i>, Randi's 
	1980 classic of the early skeptics movement. When I got on board—as a fan, 
	if not a true believer—the group was entrenched in a slugfest with the 
	flourishing occult business. The skeptics were a feisty group of scientists, 
	philosophers, magicians, and atheists, united by their dedication to 
	rational thought and their intolerance of credulity. Randi, a professional 
	magician and escape artist who once
	<a href="http://www.iaw.com/~falls/devil_frame.html#X">dangled</a> upside 
	down in a straitjacket over Niagara Falls, joined up with
	<a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/home/kurtz/index.htm">Paul Kurtz</a>, 
	a philosophy professor in upstate New York, who had himself
	<a href="http://psychicinvestigator.com/demo/AstroSkc2.htm">taken on</a> 
	newspaper astrologers. In 1976, Kurtz formed the
	<a href="http://www.csicop.org/">Committee for the Scientific Inquiry Into 
	Claims of the Paranormal</a> to explain, expose, dispel, and debunk the 
	supernatural and all its practitioners.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For decades, CSICOP's members did 
	all of that with fierce passion. But in recent years the skeptics' 
	enthusiasm for debunking has begun to subside. Kurtz now disowns the 
	practice, instead favoring what he calls a &quot;positive&quot; defense of science and 
	reason. <a href="http://www.sciam.com/directory.cfm?dirID=13&chanID=sa006">
	Michael Shermer</a>, the historian of science whose California-based 
	Skeptics Society hosted the conference in Pasadena, also avoids the D-word. 
	He'd rather talk about
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0716733870/102-6661794-6428962?v=glance">
	why people are fooled</a> by supernatural hoaxes than spend his time 
	debunking them. His group has doused the activism of CSICOP's early days 
	with a program of research, lectures, and meetings. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why have the skeptics grown so 
	dreary? Their tactics have changed to reflect a new set of targets. What was 
	once a movement to take down television psychics and fortunetellers now 
	concentrates on mainstream foes like President George W. Bush,
	<a href="http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/nhmag.html">Intelligent 
	Design</a> theorists, and opponents of stem-cell research. A tedious battle 
	against the modern bugaboos of religion and politics demands tedious tactics 
	and more manpower. Today the skeptics comprise an alliance of interest 
	groups, only a subset of whom even call themselves skeptics. A recent effort 
	to choose a common name for the movement failed miserably—perhaps because 
	the proposed <a href="http://www.the-brights.net/">appellation</a> managed 
	to sound both arrogant and New Age-y. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many of these subgroups have their 
	own societies and annual meetings, and the Skeptics Society conference I 
	went to is one stop on the circuit. In keeping with Shermer's philosophy, 
	the meeting in Pasadena had little to do with the supernatural. A parade of 
	invited speakers provided popular-science lectures on the workings of the 
	human brain, without reference to the paranormal or the occult. When the 
	Amazing Randi finally took the stage as the keynote speaker on the last 
	night of the conference, he seemed almost retro. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Randi had for decades used his 
	insider's knowledge of the flim-flam trade to humiliate a generation of 
	occultists. Chief among his trophies was Uri Geller, an Israeli-born, 
	disco-era mentalist who claimed, among other things, that he had the ability 
	to soften metal and move a compass needle with his mind. Geller appeared on 
	talk shows and <a href="http://www.uri-geller.com/pics/mag.jpg">magazine 
	covers</a>, and several
	<a href="http://www.uri-geller.com/content/research/sria.htm">academic 
	researchers</a> said they had validated his powers in the lab. Randi 
	cleverly challenged Geller as a magician. He mimicked Geller's tricks using 
	sleight of hand and then explained how they were done. In 1973, Randi went 
	for the kill, conspiring with Johnny Carson (who was himself an amateur 
	magician) to trap Geller on live TV. At Randi's instruction, producers on 
	the Tonight Show provided all the props for Geller's act and didn't let him 
	on the set before the cameras rolled. The plan worked, and a squirming 
	Geller was unable to perform a single trick. The video
	<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/onegoodmove/movies/carsongeller.html">clip</a> 
	of his on-air collapse remains a cherished keepsake of diehard skeptics. 
	(Today Geller is best-known as a
	<a href="http://www.adalarms.force9.co.uk/urigeller/michael-jackson/">close 
	personal friend</a> to Michael Jackson.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since that glorious display of 
	public humiliation, the Amazing Randi has taken on levitators, psychic 
	surgeons, <a href="http://www.dowsers.org/dowsing.htm">dowsers</a>, and 
	astrologers. In 1999, he debunked homeopathic remedies for insomnia by 
	swallowing an entire bottle of &quot;natural&quot; sleeping pills in front of a 
	congressional committee. His provocative and grandiose style has landed him 
	in court more than once—Geller made several attempts to sue him, for 
	example—and Randi says most of the $272,000 MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant he 
	received two decades ago was spent on legal bills. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today, the closest thing Randi has 
	to successors are the magician-debunkers Penn &amp; Teller (whose half-hour TV 
	show, <i><a href="http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/about.do">Bullshit</a></i>, 
	tries to avoid legal liability by calling con-men &quot;assholes&quot; instead of 
	&quot;fakes&quot;). As the man who inspired so many people to join the skeptics early 
	on, Randi remains a principal attraction at society meetings, even as the 
	movement officially heads in a new direction. Before he took the stage on 
	the last night of the conference, Shermer introduced him with the clip of 
	Uri Geller's unmasking on The Tonight Show. Randi walked on to multiple 
	standing ovations; a woman bounded up from the audience to give him a hug.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shermer and Randi sat on chairs near 
	the front of the stage, as if for a quiet chat. But it wasn't long before 
	Randi began to sway with emotion. He choked up while describing a little boy 
	who had been deceived by a charlatan faith healer. And then, in a burst of 
	bravado, his voice surged to the last row of the auditorium: &quot;They're fakes, 
	they're phonies, they're scoundrels … and they need to be behind bars!&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The skeptics in Pasadena went crazy. 
	After days of restrained, informational talks, here was someone with a flair 
	for theater—a rabble-rousing activist. But if Randi's words inspired us, it 
	wasn't clear exactly what we were inspired to do or to whom we should do it. 
	To us, Uri Geller seemed small-time: The enemies we had in mind were 
	fundamentalist ideologues, like the ones on the Kansas school board who have 
	tried to <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2118320/">demote</a> evolution in 
	the science curriculum. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That's the conundrum of the modern 
	skeptics movement: Intelligent Design theorists and deniers of global 
	warming may very well be phonies and scoundrels, but no one is going to 
	debunk them in the classic sense. You can't reveal their hidden microphones 
	or mimic their tricks with sleight of hand. Intelligent Design, after all, 
	is an attempt to recast (even to &quot;rebunk&quot;) Creationism in scientific terms. 
	The best weapon against it isn't dramatic exposé, but scientific argument. 
	So a change in tactics makes sense for the movement. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Still, the fervent response to 
	Randi's tirade suggests a deep-seated nostalgia for old-fashioned debunking. 
	In the end, it's just more fun to see a fake like Geller squirm than it is 
	to hear a science lecture. Supernatural scammers may not be the most 
	dangerous opponents of reason, but why not knock a few off every now and 
	again to rally the troops? After all,
	<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release.cfm?newsID=381">protests</a> 
	from academic scientists aren't exactly changing the world. Reports on 
	climate change are still
	<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/06/08/climate.us.official.reut/">
	vetted</a> by industry flunkies, and the federal government remains
	<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7964239/">unwilling</a> to fully 
	support stem-cell research. With few victories to inspire us, let's keep on 
	debunking. If only for old-times' sake.</font></p>
