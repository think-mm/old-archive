				<p></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There’s simple rule for 
				atheists and agnostics in America: keep your head down and your 
				mouth shut. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I recently wrote an 
				article for Dissident Voice web site criticizing the new Pope 
				and organized religion. Boy, did the brickbats start to fly. 
				Many were put off by my assessment of the Pope as right-wing 
				extremist who will undoubtedly lead the papal caravan back to 
				the 13th century. More were offended by my dismissive remarks 
				about religion. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why? Is it such a 
				stretch to acknowledge that someone may have an opinion that 
				veers from the majority? (According to the latest polls, 90% of 
				Americans believe in God) </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Or, is it simply because 
				atheists and their unwelcome worldview offer a real challenge to 
				people of faith? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Face it, atheism in 
				America is a lonely experience. Atheists are widely distrusted 
				and there is a palpable undercurrent of discrimination directed 
				at them, even though it is less noticeable than the prejudice 
				aimed at other groups. In many ways, atheists are social 
				pariahs, America’s leper colony. Just about everyone is wary of 
				atheists, as the polls repeatedly indicate. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For example, I saw a 
				poll in Free Inquiry magazine a few years ago that showed that 
				in the 1960s only very small minority of the public would vote 
				for blacks, Jews or atheists (all of them in the 20 to 30% 
				range). In the late 1990s when the same question was asked, 
				blacks and Jews scored in the 70% range; not perfect, but much 
				better. Atheists, however, still dithered in the 20 to 30% 
				range. No change. The distrust and bigotry are still as alive 
				today as they were 40 years ago. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why? Are atheists a 
				threat to society? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And, how is it that 
				politicians, entertainers or whomever can expound ad nauseam 
				about God and, yet, the views of atheists are scrupulously 
				omitted from the media. (With all the religious programming on 
				TV and radio, have you ever heard an atheist offering his point 
				of view?) If 90% of the population were so secure in their 
				beliefs, it certainly wouldn’t hurt to get a second opinion, 
				would it? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fact is atheism 
				simply doesn’t exist in America. It is the forbidden topic, like 
				homosexuality 20 years ago. If I were a conspiracy theorist, I’d 
				say that there is concerted effort to downplay atheism so as not 
				to undermine the unifying myth (God) that binds western society 
				together. The fact that the vast majority of Americans accept 
				the existence of some super-human phenomenon, of which there is 
				no scientific proof, shows that religion has been the most 
				successful PR campaign in the history of mankind. Regrettably, 
				in our “free” society, no one is even allowed to openly debate 
				the issue. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Faith: Search for 
				truth or conditioning? </font></b></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religious faith is 
				almost always determined by one’s upbringing. The vast majority 
				of Americans wind up practicing the same religion as their 
				parents. This proves that their religion was not the result of 
				an objective, open-minded search for the truth, but simply a 
				matter of conditioning and habit. Many people will probably be 
				offended by that observation. After all, they believe they have 
				discovered the truth independent of the coercive influences of 
				family and environment. But the demographics of religious groups 
				change at a glacial pace, leaving Buddhists, Hindus, Christians 
				and Jews in similar numbers and locations as they have been for 
				hundreds of years; proof-positive that religious affiliation can 
				be reliably predicted by geographic and statistical analysis.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is this “free will”? 
				Actually, the predictability of human behavior is a serious 
				challenge to our notions of personal freedom. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Like most unbelievers, 
				I’ve been more than willing to keep my mouth shut and my head 
				down, not drawing attention to myself and resisting arguments 
				with religious people. But, now, things are changing so 
				dramatically that withdrawing is no longer an option. Religion 
				is being politically exploited to such an extent that it’s 
				threatening the fundamental institutions of democratic 
				government. There is a real chance that democracy in America 
				will not survive Bush’s tenure as president. Atheists have no 
				choice except to step forward and raise their voices against 
				this new menace. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">What is an atheist?
				</font></b></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In reality, I never 
				think of myself as an atheist. It is a foul, pejorative term 
				intended to pigeonhole someone so that his or her views can be 
				marginalized. But atheism is not that easy to dismiss. After 
				all, it is not a philosophy or a belief system, but something 
				entirely different. Basically, it is a suspension of judgment on 
				a topic for which there is no demonstrable evidence. It is an 
				unwillingness to draw conclusions without proof. Is that atheism 
				or just basic science? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In any event, I prefer 
				to think of myself as an “unbeliever” in a world of unbelievers.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why? Because, in fact, 
				no one really knows whether God exists or not. That makes us all 
				unbelievers. We may elevate conjecture to a level of human 
				virtue, calling it “faith”, but it is still just conjecture. 
				Nothing concrete can be verified. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, what is faith and 
				why is it so important to religious people? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Faith is the “acceptance 
				of unproved assumptions.” </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unproved assumptions? 
				How is that different than saying that faith is nothing more 
				than hearsay, speculation, hypothesis or theory? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is someone a better 
				person because he’s willing to accept something that has no 
				basis in fact and is in no way scientifically provable? </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And, doesn’t that 
				conflict with the idea that God gave man the capacity to reason 
				to make sense of his world? Or should man just abandon his 
				thinking abilities and take a leap of faith? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Unbelief” is man’s 
				natural state. The unbelieving mind is the mind that is 
				flexible, open to learning and receptive to new things. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, the 
				believer only experiences reality through the prism of his own 
				ideology. His attachment to his own views creates a filter 
				through which the world is interpreted. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">True, for some religion 
				is a liberating experience, and their practice only increases 
				their expansiveness and generosity. For others, however, it is 
				just a way of masking their own mean spiritedness or (in the 
				case of Bush) carrying out their own repressive agenda. When we 
				consider the old expression, “Even the Devil can cite scripture 
				for his own purposes,” maybe we think about Jerry Falwell, Pat 
				Robertson or some other equally sanctimonious charlatan who use 
				their knowledge of the Bible to denigrate people who differ in 
				their political perspective. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">The Role of Faith
				</font></b></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For many religious 
				people, faith is the cornerstone of their lives and they work 
				tirelessly to spread the word of the Lord. They believe that 
				expressing their faith through proselytizing or missionary work 
				is inherently good. They cannot possibly grasp how excruciating 
				it is for unbelievers to endure their over zealous preaching.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To the unbeliever, the 
				religious fanatic is simply a predator who struggles to fight 
				off his own insecurity by trying to convert someone else. This 
				isn’t a sign of confidence and conviction, it’s a sign of 
				uncertainty, the type of uncertainty that naturally emerges from 
				“not knowing”. Preaching merely demonstrates that someone is 
				attached to their own opinions, not that they are “saintly” 
				people. Most people judge others by the way they behave. The 
				rest is just salesmanship. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Belief and unbelief are 
				counterbalancing forces in society. When unbelief is 
				“disappeared” by the media or excluded from the national 
				dialogue, religious extremism increases. Isn’t that what is 
				taking place in America today? Currently, there’s a 
				full-throated religious debate roiling the nation, on everything 
				from stem cells, to abortion, to war, to euthanasia, to 
				contraception. The one voice that is missing from the debate is 
				the voice of the unbeliever. He has no place at the table, so a 
				reasoned and balanced result cannot be expected. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Bush and Religion
				</font></b></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now that President Bush 
				is making a concerted effort to demolish the wall of separation 
				between church and state, we should be asking ourselves what the 
				overall effects of religion are likely to be on American 
				society. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hasn’t Bush’s 
				manipulation of religion created a more autocratic government? 
				Hasn’t it been used to divide the nation into factions where a 
				small group of fanatics are magnified by the media to represent 
				the greater interests of the American people? Wasn’t religion 
				used as the excuse for the conspicuous flaws in the Ohio and 
				Florida presidential election? (The overwhelming statistical 
				evidence proves that paperless voting machines produced the Bush 
				victory, not the imaginary hordes of fundamentalist Christians 
				coming down from the mountains to vote for the first time as 
				Karl Rove would have us believe) Hasn’t religion been used as 
				part of a broader plan to undermine our laws, target vulnerable 
				groups, eviscerate civil liberties, empower the President, 
				weaken our courts, attack science, (global warming, evolution 
				etc.) and justify a campaign of global aggression? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Are these developments 
				coincidental, or are they the inevitable result of a society 
				where 90% of the people profess believe in some unknown and 
				unknowable, supreme being whose divine will is always manifest 
				in the world? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe that there is 
				a direct correlation, just as there is a correlation between the 
				large number of atheists and agnostics in Europe and the form of 
				socialistic democracy that has flourished there. The efforts of 
				unbelievers is naturally aimed at improving things in this 
				world, and that includes shaping a government that is more 
				respondent to the needs of its citizens rather than catering to 
				the bottom line ambitions of corporate bigwigs. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For example, in France 
				and the Netherlands atheists and agnostics represent nearly 35% 
				of the population. Both countries also have 6 weeks paid 
				vacation, maternity leave, an educational system that towers 
				above America’s, full state health and dental care, retirement 
				at 65, and a 35 hour work week. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The highest tax bracket 
				in France and Sweden is 52% as compared to America’s 37%. The 
				effects of this redistribution on society are immeasurable. On 
				the one hand it builds a strong and productive middle class that 
				can enjoy the benefits of citizenship with much greater equity. 
				More importantly, it reduces the potential for a few powerful 
				men to dominate the media, control the political process, savage 
				civil liberties and lead the country to war. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These are the benefits 
				of greater redistribution, and they are directly related to the 
				number of “unbelievers” in the society as a whole. The 
				unbeliever is focused on the improvements that can be achieved 
				in this life, not the next. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Were the Founding 
				Fathers unbelievers? </font></b></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The American experiment 
				began in the minds of men who were Unitarians, Deists and 
				freethinkers. These are not dogmatic religions, but rely on a 
				person’s own ability to discover the truth for himself. (The 
				many times I have attended Unitarian meetings, I have never 
				heard a sermon about Christ) The founders were a product of the 
				French Revolution and the Enlightenment, devoting themselves to 
				the principles of reason, science and equalitarian government. 
				They were forever alert to the insidious power of religion to 
				corrupt the values of secular society and to undermine 
				democracy. That explains why they had such high regard for men 
				like Edmund Burke who said, “The miseries derived to mankind 
				from superstition under the name of religion, and of 
				ecclesiastical tyranny under the name of church government, have 
				been clearly and usefully exposed. We begin to think from reason 
				and nature alone.” </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Or Tom Paine, “I believe 
				in the equality of man, and I believe that religious duties 
				consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make 
				our fellow-creatures happy.” </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Or, Thomas Jefferson, 
				“In every country and every age the priest has been hostile to 
				Liberty. He is always in allegiance with the despot, abetting 
				his abuses in return for protection for his own.” Or, “Question 
				with boldness even the existence of God; because, if there be 
				one, he must more approve the homage of reason than of 
				blindfolded fear…. Do not be frightened from this inquiry by any 
				fear of its consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is 
				no God, you will find incitements to virtue in he comfort and 
				pleasantness you feel in its exercise and in the love of others 
				which it will procure for you.” </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jefferson’s skepticism 
				(agnosticism?) was commonplace among the founders and was 
				foundational to the establishment of democracy in America. Our 
				commitment to reason, science and social justice has been 
				drowned beneath the theocratic gibberish and the unrelenting 
				demagoguery coming from Washington. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Other voices need to be 
				heard in the mainstream to put the country back on the path of 
				sanity -- the voices of atheists, agnostics, unbelievers and 
				skeptics. </font></p>
