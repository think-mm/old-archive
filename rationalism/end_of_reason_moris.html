&nbsp;</div>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For Cardinal Tarcisio 
				Bertone, until 2003 the deputy head of the Congregation for the 
				Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican's most powerful office, 
				seeing <i>The DaVinci Code</i> in a Vatican bookstore was the 
				last straw. In early March he lashed out at Catholic bookstores 
				for carrying the book, and directed Catholics not to read it. 
				Why? &quot;There is a very real risk that many people who read it 
				will believe that the fables it contains are true.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fables?</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dan Brown's phenomenal 
				bestseller suggests that Jesus was an immensely popular and 
				prophetic leader who married one of his closest associates and 
				had a family. Archbishop Bertone and the Church maintain that 
				Jesus was at the same time a man, the son of God, and God 
				himself, that a virgin woman gave birth to him and remained a 
				virgin, that a few days after he was killed he came back to life 
				and shortly thereafter was taken up to heaven to spend an 
				eternity directing the destinies of billions of people.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a rational world the 
				burden of proof as to which is fable would fall on the Church. 
				But there's the rub. For when it comes to organized religion, no 
				burden of proof is required. On the contrary, by definition, 
				religion requires faith and faith renounces evidence. Taking a 
				proposition &quot;on faith&quot; means to consciously and willfully refuse 
				to examine the facts.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a word for this 
				type of thinking: Superstition. Many dictionaries define 
				superstition as &quot;belief which is not based on human reason or 
				scientific knowledge.&quot; The American Heritage Dictionary defines 
				superstition as &quot;a belief, practice or rite irrationally 
				maintained by ignorance of the laws of nature&quot; and &quot;a fearful or 
				abject state resulting from such ignorance or irrationality.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, we all have 
				our superstitions. I may refrain from walking under a ladder, or 
				throw salt over my shoulder after a salt spill to avoid bad 
				things from happening to me. But organized religion elevates 
				superstition to an entirely new level. It demands that we govern 
				our lives with superstition, promises us eternal salvation and 
				bliss if we do, and threatens us with eternal damnation and pain 
				if we do not.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is long past time we 
				stopped giving a free pass to organizations that refuse to be 
				guided by reason and would force their unreason on the entire 
				society. A first step would be to stop calling these 
				&quot;faith-based institutions&quot; and start calling them by the 
				synonymous and much more instructive term, &quot;superstition-based 
				institutions.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>No Other Superstition 
				But This One</b></font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Organized superstitions 
				might be more socially supportable if their creed included a 
				provision accepting the organized superstitions of others. 
				Unfortunately, modern religions do not practice tolerance. For 
				example Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore gained widespread fame 
				and even adulation when he refused to obey court orders to 
				remove from the Alabama Courthouse a huge stone tablet on which 
				was inscribed the Ten Commandments. When he was asked how he 
				would react to the suggestion that a monument to the Koran or 
				the Torah also be placed in the Courthouse he brusquely declared 
				he would prohibit such an installation.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A few months later, Lt. 
				Gen. William G. &quot;Jerry&quot; Boykin, the new deputy undersecretary of 
				defense for intelligence explained why he knew he would win his 
				battle against Muslims in Somalia. &quot;I knew my God was bigger 
				than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an 
				idol.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The creationism vs. 
				evolution debate also illuminates this intolerance. Christians 
				insist that their creation myth represent the creationist side. 
				But there are many creationist myths, many of which predated 
				both Christianity and Judaism. If evidence is not needed, why 
				exclude any superstitions? As Sam Harris notes in <i>The End of 
				Faith</i>, &quot;there is no more evidence to justify a belief in the 
				literal existence of Yahweh and Satan than there was to keep 
				Zeus perched upon his mountain throne or Poseidon churning the 
				seas.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The impact of moving 
				towards &quot;superstition-based institutions&quot; would be highly 
				controversial, quite educational, and on the whole exceedingly 
				salutary. Consider the impact on the audience if we switched the 
				interchangeable terms in President George W. Bush's following 
				statement, posted on a federal web site:</font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe in the 
					power of superstition in people's lives. Our government 
					should not fear programs that exist because a church or a 
					synagogue or a mosque has decided to start one. We should 
					not discriminate against programs based upon superstition in 
					America. We should enable them to access federal money, 
					because superstition-based programs can change people's 
					lives, and America will be better off for it.</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Fanatics and Zealots 
				Destroying the Liberty of Thought</b></font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In her magnificent book,
				<i>Freethinkers</i>, Susan Jacoby describes the 230-year-old 
				battle in the United States between reason and superstition. She 
				discusses the post-Civil War period in which the battle may have 
				been most evenly matched.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Robert Green Ingersoll, 
				possibly the best known American in the post Civil War era and 
				the nation's foremost orator, traveled around the country 
				arguing about the harm that comes from self-congratulatory, 
				aggressive and assertive organized religions.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He explained why the 
				word God does not appear in the U.S. Constitution. The founding 
				fathers &quot;knew that the recognition of a Deity would be seized 
				upon by fanatics and zealots as a pretext for destroying the 
				liberty of thought. They knew the terrible history of the church 
				too well to place in her keeping, or in the keeping of her God, 
				the sacred rights of man.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ingersoll believed that 
				reason, not faith, could and should be the basis for modern 
				morality. &quot;Our civilization is not Christian. It does not come 
				from the skies. It is not a result of 'inspiration,'&quot; he 
				insisted. &quot;It is the child of invention, of discovery, of 
				applied knowledge -- that is to say, of science. When man 
				becomes great and grand enough to admit that all have equal 
				rights; when thought is untrammeled; when worship shall consist 
				in doing useful things; when religion means the discharge of 
				obligations to our fellow-men, then, and not until then, will 
				the world be civilized.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1885, Elizabeth Cady 
				Stanton explained how organized and assertive religions around 
				the world have restricted women's rights. &quot;You may go over the 
				world and you will find that every form of religion which has 
				breathed upon this earth has degraded woman ... I have been 
				traveling over the old world during the last few years and have 
				found new food for thought. What power is it that makes the 
				Hindoo woman burn herself upon a funeral pyre of her husband? 
				Her religion. What holds the Turkish woman in the harem? Her 
				religion. By what power do the Mormons perpetuate their system 
				of polygamy? By their religion. Man, of himself, could not do 
				this; but when he declares, 'Thus saith the Lord', of course he 
				can do it.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Stanton's enduring motto 
				was, &quot;Seek Truth for Authority, not Authority for Truth.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the era when 
				Ingersoll and Stanton spread their own form of the gospel, the 
				Church was making ever-more explicit its own hostility to reason 
				as a guide to human behavior. In 1869, Pope Pius IX convinced 
				the First Vatican Council to proclaim, &quot;let him be anathema ... 
				(w)ho shall say that human sciences ought to be pursued in such 
				a spirit of freedom that one may be allowed to hold as true 
				their assertions, even when opposed to revealed doctrine.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His successor, Pope Leo 
				XIII, in one of his best known encyclicals maintained, it &quot;has 
				even been contended that public authority with its dignity and 
				power of ruling, originates not from God but from the mass of 
				the people, which considering itself unfettered by all divine 
				sanctions, refuses to submit to any laws that it has not passed 
				of its own free will.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Other churches agreed. 
				In 1878, geologist Alexander Winchell was dismissed from the 
				faculty of Vanderbilt University in Nashville for publishing his 
				opinion that human life had existed on earth long before the 
				biblical time frame for the creation of Adam. Most Methodists 
				supported the dismissal, arguing that Vanderbilt was founded by 
				Methodists and dedicated to the goals of the church.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some 45 years later, the 
				famous Scopes trial opened. Most of us know that William 
				Jennings Bryan was the lawyer for the prosecution of Scopes, a 
				biology teacher who in his classroom violated Tennessee law 
				forbidding the mention of evolution. What we may not know is 
				that William Jennings Bryan was a three-time democratic 
				presidential candidate and Woodrow Wilson's secretary of state. 
				After the Wilson administration Bryan devoted himself to 
				campaigning around the nation on behalf of state laws banning 
				the teaching of evolution. For Bryan faith always trumped 
				science. &quot;(I)t is better to trust in the Rock of Ages than to 
				know the ages of rocks; it is better for one to know that he is 
				close to the Heavenly Father than to know how far the stars in 
				the heaven are apart.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That was then. This is 
				now. A few months ago, a dozen science centers, mostly in the 
				South, refused to show <i>Volcanoes</i>, a science film funded 
				in part by the National Science Foundation. The film was turned 
				down because it very briefly raises the possibility that life on 
				Earth may have originated at undersea steam vents.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Carol Murray, director 
				of marketing for the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, 
				said that many people said the film was &quot;blasphemous.&quot; Lisa 
				Buzzelli, director of the Charleston Imax Theater in South 
				Carolina, told <i>The New York Times</i>, &quot;We have definitely a 
				lot more creation public than evolution public.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Buzzelli's probably 
				right. And that cannot bode well for America's future economic 
				and technological leadership. A 1988 survey by researchers from 
				the University of Texas found that one of four public school 
				biology teachers thought that humans and dinosaurs might have 
				inhabited the earth simultaneously. A recent survey by Gallup 
				found that 35 percent of Americans believe the Bible is the 
				literal and inerrant word of the Creator of the universe. 
				Another 48 percent believe it is the &quot;inspired&quot; word of the 
				same. Some 46 percent of Americans take a literalist view of 
				creation; another 40 percent believe God has guided creation 
				over the course of millions of years.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>The Politicizing of 
				Religion</b></font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I know most people who 
				are reading this are asking, &quot;Would you ban organized religion?&quot; 
				Of course not. Religion is an integral part of human existence. 
				For tens of thousands of years humans have sought to explain the 
				unknowable and have found comfort in believing that the death of 
				a loved one may simply be the transition of that loved one to 
				another, more sublime state.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But today organized 
				religion has declared its intention to use its influence far 
				beyond its congregation. The politicization of religion and the 
				rise of a superstition-driven state may be the most important 
				development in this country in many, many decades.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tom DeLay, House 
				Majority Leader and arguably the third most powerful person in 
				Washington told an audience just a few weeks ago that the 
				problems in America began when &quot;they stopped churches from 
				getting into politics ... Lyndon Johnson ... passed a law that 
				said you couldn't get in politics or you're going to lose your 
				tax-exempt status ... It forces Christians back into the church. 
				That's what's going on in America ... That's not what Christ 
				asked us to do.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Supreme Court Justice 
				Antonin Scalia, a leading candidate to become chief justice, has 
				declared in oral hearings &quot;the fact that government derives its 
				authority from God.&quot; In January 2002, in a major speech 
				revealingly titled &quot;God's Justice and Ours,&quot; delivered to the 
				University of Chicago Divinity School, Scalia favorably cited 
				Paul's announcement, &quot;For there is no power but of God: the 
				powers that be are ordained of God.&quot; And Scalia declared that 
				the death penalty is God's will. &quot;The more Christian a country 
				is the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as 
				immoral,&quot; he observed. &quot;I attribute that to the fact that, for 
				the believing Christian, death is no big deal.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of President Bush's 
				first acts in office was to create an Office of Faith-Based and 
				Community Initiatives. Today 10 federal agencies have a Center 
				for the Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. The White House 
				web site gives churches Do's and Don'ts for applying for federal 
				assistance. It has funded 30 organizations to provide training 
				and technical assistance for religious organizations desiring 
				federal grants. And it guarantees that any religious 
				organization in need of help will find a ready and willing 
				person on the other end of the phone.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After failing to 
				persuade Congress to change the law, President Bush, by 
				Executive Order, rewrote the rules to allow federal agencies to 
				directly fund churches and other religious groups. In 2003 such 
				groups received an astonishing $1.17 billion in grants from 
				federal agencies.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;That's not enough,&quot; H. 
				James Towey, director of the White House Office of Faith-Based 
				and Community Initiatives recently told the Associated Press. He 
				notes that another $40 billion in federal money is given out by 
				state governments and &quot;many states do not realize that federal 
				rules now allow them to fund these organizations.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 2003, an independent 
				study found little activity or interest by states in contracting 
				with religious groups. But federal intervention has persuaded 
				them that future funding depended on their having these groups 
				provide services. By Towey's count, 21 governors have 
				established their own faith-based offices.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Office of 
				Faith-Based and Community Initiatives maintains, &quot;There is no 
				general federal law that prohibits faith-based organizations 
				that receive federal funds from hiring on a religious basis.&quot; It 
				further explains that &quot;for a religious organization to define or 
				carry out its mission, it is important that it be able to take 
				religion into account in hiring staff. Just as a college or 
				university can take the academic credentials of an applicant for 
				a professorship into consideration in order to maintain high 
				standards, or an environmental organization can consider the 
				views of potential employees on conservation, so too should a 
				faith-based organization be able to take into account an 
				applicant's religious belief when making a hiring decision.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One major program funded 
				by the White House is Charles Colson's Prison Fellowship 
				Ministries. It runs the InnerChange Freedom Initiative in 
				prisons in Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa and Texas. The 
				Christ-centered program offers prisoners privileges that include 
				access to a big TV, computers, and private bathrooms in return 
				for a hefty dose of Bible study and Christian counseling. As a 
				condition of being hired, the program's employees are required 
				to sign a statement affirming their belief in a literal 
				interpretation of the Bible.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Superstition as a 
				Lethal Force</b></font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Organized superstition 
				in this country has begun to drive and guide social policy. The 
				clearest example of this is the recent enactment by several 
				states of laws that allow pharmacists and doctors and hospitals 
				to refuse to treat patients whose behavior conflicts with the 
				their superstitions.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The central problem with 
				organized, assertive religion, of course, is that it endows 
				superstition with a moral and messianic fervor. God-directed 
				superstition can be a lethal force. Indeed, one might argue that 
				this type of force is behind much of the violence around the 
				world. The conflicts in Palestine (Jews v. Muslims), the Balkans 
				(Orthodox Serbians v. Muslims), Northern Ireland (Protestants v. 
				Catholics), Kashmir (Muslims v. Hindus), Indonesia (Muslims v. 
				Timorese Christians) and the Caucasus (Orthodox Russians v. 
				Chechen Muslims) constitute only a few of the places where 
				religion has been the explicit cause of million of deaths in the 
				last ten years.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sam Harris discusses 
				&quot;the burden of paradise.&quot; Why are there suicide bombers? 
				&quot;Because they actually believe what they say they believe. They 
				believe in the literal truth of the Koran ...Why did 19 
				well-educated, middle class men trade their lives in this world 
				for the privilege of killing thousands of our neighbors? Because 
				they believed that they would go straight to paradise for doing 
				so.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To Harris, condoning the 
				use of superstition as an important social force enables and 
				encourages extremism. &quot;The concessions we have made to religious 
				faith,&quot; he maintains, &quot;to the idea that belief can be sanctified 
				by something other than evidence -- have rendered us unable to 
				name, much less address, one of the most pervasive causes of 
				conflict in our world.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1784, Patrick Henry 
				introduced a bill in the Virginia General Assembly that would 
				have assessed taxes on all citizens for the support of &quot;teachers 
				of the Christian religion.&quot; The bill's passage seemed certain. 
				But then James Madison issued his Memorial and Remonstrance 
				against Religious Assessments, eventually signed by some 2,000 
				Virginians.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;What influence in fact 
				have ecclesiastical establishments had on Civil Society?&quot; 
				Madison asked. &quot;In some instances they have been seen to erect a 
				spiritual tyranny on the ruins of Civil authority; in many 
				instances they have seen the upholding of the thrones of 
				political tyranny; in no instance have they been seen the 
				guardians of the liberty of the people.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The two-year debate over 
				the assessment bill ended in its overwhelming defeat. Instead 
				the Virginia legislature in 1786 passed an Act for Establishing 
				Religious Freedom. The preamble to the original bill, written by 
				Thomas Jefferson, declared, &quot;Well aware that the opinions and 
				belief of men depend not on their own will, but follow 
				involuntarily the evidence proposed to their mind; that Almighty 
				God hath created the mind free... .&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The final law contained 
				only the last few words of Jefferson's preamble, &quot;Whereas, 
				Almighty God hath created the mind free ... .&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the passage of the 
				legislation, Jefferson wrote Madison to express his pride in 
				Virginia's leadership on this crucial issue. &quot;(I)t is 
				comfortable to see the standard of reason at length erected, 
				after so many ages, during which the human mind has been held in
