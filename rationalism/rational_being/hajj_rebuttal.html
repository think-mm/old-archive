  front of their Creator and Sustainer. So it went on and on, not only around
  the ‘Harem Sharif’ but also in the ground floor, first floor, second
  floor, roof top, as well as in the basement, which was out of our sight.
  Thousands and thousands of devotees from different cast, creed, culture and
  country bowing down together with unsurpassed discipline all together in front
  of the one and only Creator- the Almighty Allah. The scene was so incredible,
  so enchanting, so captivating and so touching that no where in the world there
  is one even close to it.</font></span></p>

  the devotees were engrossed deep in their prayers the air above was alive with
  scores and scores of birds (pigeons and ‘ababeel’) flying high, diving
  down, and encircling the ‘Kabah’ but none, none at all making this scared
  place dirty. &nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:#333399">For there was no
  dropping from the birds anywhere in or around this place, not even in the
  courtyards and the adjacent roads where the devotees overflowed during the
  peak time of Hajj, to pray in utter submission to their Lord, the most
  Beneficent and Merciful.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:#333399">Over these few
  days I was in fact on the lookout, day and night, to detect any dropping of
  even a single bird, but not even one! What a miracle! You rarely see miracles
  like this in today's modern world. But the birds do eat, and a lot of it too!
  As the pilgrims are continuously offering them fistfuls of grains. &nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="color:#333399">The one and only

    Hajjis told me that the Masjid complex is constantly being cleaned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Think about this from a rationalistic viewpoint:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>there are an estimated 2 million devotees in such a compact place who
    are moving constantly (as you have put it so eloquently).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Do you really think that you are going to find bird dropping amongst
