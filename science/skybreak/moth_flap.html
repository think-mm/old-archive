	<p><i>Revolutionary Worker #1159, July 21, 2002.</i></p>
	<p>The evolution by natural selection of industrial melanism<a style="text-decoration: none" name="Moth Footnote 1" href="#Moth footnote text 1"><sup>*</sup></a> 
	in the peppered moth species <i>Biston betularia </i>(as well as in many 
	other insect species) is a well-known and well- documented phenomenon which 
	is discussed and illustrated in just about every biology textbook. Recently, 
	however, some articles have appeared in the press reporting that some 
	scientists have challenged the validity of some of the original experiments 
	done by H.B.D. Kettlewell in England in the 1950s, making it seem that this 
	classical example of evolution by natural selection rests on shaky ground. 
	Those of you who detect the smell of Creationists in this &quot;controversy&quot; 
	would be right: for instance, one of the main people stirring up a fuss 
	about the peppered moth example is none other than Jonathan Wells, a 
	Berkeley-based Intelligent Design Creationist (what a blight on Berkeley!!) 
	and a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of 
	Science and Culture--a small Seattle based &quot;nest&quot; of IDCs that sends 
	speakers around the country to debate evolutionists and promote Intelligent 
	Design Creationism in opposition to evolution. In other words, when you hear 
	that the classical example of evolution in action in the peppered moth is 
	being &quot;challenged,&quot; it might be important to consider the source!</p>
	<p>Nevertheless, since even a broken clock can be right twice a day, we owe 
	it to ourselves to always keep an open mind and recognize the possibility 
	that new information could reverse prior scientific findings. But this seems 
	unlikely in the case of the evolution of industrial melanism by natural 
	selection in the peppered moth or in other insects. No doubt the very last 
	word has not been written on this story--for instance, there may still be 
	much to learn about how other selective factors (in addition to bird 
	predation) may lead to the observed changes in gene frequencies in the moth 
	populations. But the basic story holds: there is absolutely zero doubt that 
	peppered moth populations evolved (from being made up mainly of light moths 
	to being made up mainly of dark moths) over just a few decades and in direct 
	correlation to changes in the level of industrial pollution. There is also 
	no doubt that this evolutionary trend reversed itself when the levels of 
	industrial pollution began to decrease. This whole trend was shown through 
	careful surveys of moth populations in England between the 1950s and the 
	1990s. And, more recently, the biologist Bruce Grant has documented a 
	striking case of parallel evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths 
	in the United States, comparing the relative proportions of light and dark 
	variants in moth populations near Detroit, also between the 1950s and the 
	1990s. Just as in England, the proportion of dark variants increased with 
	increases in pollution and then began to significantly decrease once again 
	as air quality improved. There is also clear evidence that predation by 
	birds has significant impacts on moth populations--birds are known to 
	consume large proportions of adult moths in any population.</p>
	<p>While Kettlewell's experiments in the 1950s may not have been absolutely 
	perfectly designed (few experiments ever are) the basic picture which 
	emerged from his work seems to be holding up: a) the systematic surveys of 
	the proportions of the different variants in moth populations over several 
	decades conclusively show that moth populations<i> definitely did evolve 
	over time, first in one and then in the other direction </i>. Again, there 
	is absolutely no doubt about this. b) Kettlewell's classical 
	mark/release/recapture experiments demonstrated that when live light-colored 
	and dark-colored moths were released together in polluted areas (where the 
	trees were darker), <i>twice as many </i>dark variants were recaptured in 
	succeeding days than light variants, indicating that, for whatever reason or 
	combination of reasons, significantly more dark variants were managing to 
	survive in polluted environments; and his experiments also showed that the 
	exact opposite was the case with releases of both types of moths in 
	unpolluted areas (where the trees were lighter): in that situation twice as 
	many light variants as dark variants were recaptured, indicating that some 
	factor was significantly favoring the survival of light variants in the 
	unpolluted areas. c) In addition, Kettlewell and other scientists actually 
	observed birds preferentially picking off light moths in polluted 
	environments, and dark moths in unpolluted environments. d) Finally, in an 
	attempt to further confirm this differential bird predation experimentally, 
	Kettlewell pinned fresh specimens of both light and dark moths to dark tree 
	trunks, and of both light and dark moths to light tree trunks. He then 
	observed and recorded how the birds in fact much more rapidly removed the 
	more readily visible forms in each case--the light moths on the dark 
	background or the dark moths on light backgrounds.<a style="text-decoration: none" name="Moth Footnote 2" href="#Moth footnote text 2"><sup>**</sup></a></p>
	<p>The Creationists have tried to sow confusion about the example of 
	evolution in the peppered moth by saying that moths do not naturally rest on 
	tree trunks during the day (when they actually do!) and by suggesting that 
	Kettlewell's experiments were &quot;unnatural, and &quot;staged&quot; because birds would 
	not normally encounter moths pinned to tree trunks. This kind of thing is <i>
	typical </i>of the misleading tactics of anti-evolution Creationists. Every 
	scientist knows that it is perfectly valid to conduct experimental 
	manipulations of nature as part of trying to figure out what's going on. <i>
	All </i>such experimental manipulations are obviously &quot;unnatural&quot; in some 
	respects, but they nevertheless provide us with valuable information (in 
	this case confirming that birds tend to more readily pick off the more 
	conspicuous variant in each environment). Such experimental manipulations 
	are a perfectly legitimate and necessary part of scientific research, and 
	for the Creationists to suggest that they represent some kind of 
	semi-fraudulent &quot;staging&quot; is a gross mischaracterization of fact.</p>
	<p>Kettlewell and his colleagues explained how they had designed these 
	experiments, and there was nothing improper or willfully misleading about 
	their approach. But the Creationists insist on confusing people by tossing 
	out a few lies (such as saying that moths don't rest on tree trunks, when 
	they do), making a few out of context references to how Kettlewell &quot;staged&quot; 
	some experiments (to make it seem as if they'd uncovered some dirty secret 
	or evidence of fraud instead of an openly described and valid experimental 
	technique), and then picking out a few points which might in fact be worth 
	further exploring (such as whether Kettlewell overemphasized the role of 
	lichens in moth camouflage) while conveniently managing to leave out any 
	discussion of the fact that the totality of observations and studies of the 
	peppered moth populations leave absolutely no doubt that these moth 
	populations<i> have in fact evolved </i>, and that people have actually been 
	able to observe this evolutionary change taking place over just a few 
	decades. Again, this is typical of creationist methodology: they often 
	combine lies, distortions, and very selective discussions of only small 
	parts of the overall picture to give people the false impression that the 
	evidence of evolution must not be such a well established fact after all, 
	when in reality nothing could be further from the truth. As others have 
	pointed out, for every <i>one </i>of the handful of Intelligent Design 
	Creationists at the Discovery Institute, for instance, there are at least <i>
	ten thousand </i>scientists who consider the basic facts of evolution to be 
	among the most solidly established and demonstrated as any in science. And 
	not only is there absolutely clear evidence of evolution in peppered moths, 
	but there are literally<i> thousands of others studies which have documented 
	natural selection in action in other populations of animals and plants in 
	the wild </i>.</p>
	<p>There is, of course, always more to learn about any scientific subject, 
	including peppered moth evolution. But when legitimate scientists debate 
	some questions among themselves as part of the ongoing <i>deepening </i>of 
	our understanding of evolution, that doesn't mean evolution itself is in 
	question. For instance, when evolutionary biologists debate whether or not 
	large-scale evolutionary changes always take place gradually or may 
	sometimes be relatively more accelerated; or the relative importance of 
	natural selection vs. genetic drift in overall evolutionary change; or why 
	there are bound to be gaps in the fossil record; or how the role of lichens 
	may or may not have been overemphasized in discussions of moth 
	camouflage--this doesn't mean that evolution itself is in doubt! Such 
	questions and debates among evolutionists further advance our understanding 
	of evolution's mechanisms, but they in no way upset the basic applecart. The 
	evolution of industrial melanism in <i>Biston betularia </i>and other 
	insects--the back and forth shifts in the proportion of different genetic 
	variants in relation to environmental changes-- is unquestionably <i>real
	</i>and has been readily observed in both England and the United States. So, 
	while we should always keep our minds open to any new scientific insights 
	which may end up enriching the basic story, we shouldn't let the 
	Creationists pull the wool over our eyes!</p>

	<p><a style="text-decoration: none" name="Moth footnote text 1">* This

	of moths or other insects in relation to an increase in industrial 
	pollution.</a>&nbsp;</p>

	Kettlewell referred to the light moths being particularly well camouflaged 
	when they rested on the whitish lichens covering some tree trunks in 
	unpolluted woods. Lichens are living &quot;crust-like&quot; organisms, composed of a 
	fungus and alga in symbiotic association. They are often found covering 
	rocks and tree trunks, and they are very sensitive to air pollution. As 
	industry developed in England, the whitish lichens covering tree trunks 
	disappeared in many areas, resulting in darker tree trunks. Some recent 
	studies have suggested that Kettlewell may have made too much of the 
	presence or absence of these lichens because there is some suggestion that 
	the proportion of light colored moths in a population may begin to increase 
	again whenever air quality improves, even if the lichens which had been 
	killed off by industrial pollution have not yet returned to the area. This 
	is an interesting question to further explore in its own right, but, 
	regardless of the presence or absence of lichens, it still seems that tree 
	trunks in relatively soot-free unpolluted areas are generally lighter in 
	color than in polluted areas.&nbsp;</a></p>
