	The Earliest Emergence of Life</a></h2>
	So many things have changed on this planet in the past 3.5 billion years or 
	so that it is very difficult to re-create in a laboratory <i>exactly </i>the 
	same conditions as existed back then--just the right &quot;mix&quot; of temperature 
	and energy and just the right proportions of chemical compounds (such as 
	methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide, water vapor, etc.) that existed in 
	earth's early atmosphere. But even though no one has yet been able to fully 
	recreate the emergence of simple life forms in a test-tube, scientists are 
	getting closer all the time to being able to do just that. Beginning with 
	Stanley Miller's famous experiments in the 1950s, a number of lab 
	experiments have demonstrated that some of the basic chemical building 
	blocks of life (including sugars and the basic components of proteins and 
	DNA) will actually begin to coalesce (&quot;self-assemble&quot;) <i>spontaneously </i>
	(on their own) given the right physical and chemical environment! 
	<p>To qualify as a &quot;life form&quot;--rather than as an inanimate (non-living) 
	object--a bit of matter has to have two main characteristics:</p>
	<p>1) the ability to actively extract energy from the outside environment 
	(such as when living plants derive energy from the sun, or when living 
	animals derive energy from eating) and,</p>
	<p>2) the ability to <i>replicate </i>itself: to qualify as &quot;alive,&quot; matter 
	has to be able to make copies of itself (though not necessarily perfectly 
	identical copies) and in replicating itself it has to be able to &quot;pass on&quot; 
	at least <i>some </i>of its characteristics to its descendants.</p>
	<p>On this planet at least, all life forms also form some kind of <i>
	membrane </i>or compartment-- such as a cell membrane--which serves to 
	contain the replication and energy-tapping mechanisms and keep them 
	relatively separate and distinct from the rest of the outside world. Most 
	scientists today think that the earliest living organisms on earth were <i>
	little more than self-replicating protein molecules enclosed in a simple 
	membrane,</i>and that all subsequent life forms evolved over millions and 
	billions of years <i>from these simple beginnings.</i></p>
	<p>Scientists began to experiment with recreating the initial steps in the 
	emergence of life in the 1950s, and much progress has been made just in the 
	last few decades. Even back in the 1950s Stanley Miller's laboratory 
	experiments showed that simple chemical reactions could in fact produce some 
	of the simplest building blocks of life: for instance, combining jolts of 
	electrical energy (as could be supplied to an early environment by 
	lightning) with a mixture of methane, ammonia and water (all of which also 
	existed in the early atmosphere of our planet) has produced, among other 
	things, some amino acids and sugars which are<i> fundamental building blocks 
	of more complex molecules in all living organisms </i>. So, in the likely 
	chemical and electrical conditions of the early earth (and, importantly, in 
	the <i>absence </i>of anything around which could <i>eat </i>any of these 
	building blocks of complex organic molecules!) the early oceans could well 
	have become rich and concentrated &quot;soups&quot; of these substances, which may 
	well have spontaneously come together to form simple interactive organic 
	films or mats clinging to the ancient rocks or drifting in the ancient seas.</p>
	<p>Some more recent laboratory experiments have even demonstrated that 
	certain simple sequences of <i>amino acids </i>(short bits of RNA for 
	instance) will sometimes<i> self-replicate </i>, or make copies of 
	themselves, <i>even in the absence of any protein enzymes </i>(which until 
	recently were thought to be absolutely required for this process to occur), 
	and these new bits of RNA have even been observed beginning to <i>evolve </i>
	on their own! Given the right mix (or chemical &quot;soup&quot;), fatty acids- -which 
	are key components of living cell membranes--have <i>also </i>been shown to 
	assemble spontaneously--suggesting that some kind of similar process may 
	well have been involved in the formation of the very first living<i> cells
	</i>. Again, the first living cells are likely to have been little more than 
	tidbits of self-replicating DNA or RNA molecules surrounded by a simple 
	membrane. Experiments investigating and demonstrating how the earliest forms 
	of life might have emerged on this planet have been going on for only a few 
	decades, so there is obviously still much to discover about these processes. 
	But what has already been learned through these experiments clearly 
	demonstrates how some of the first steps involved in the development of 
	primitive life could have taken place spontaneously (without the hand of any 
	divine &quot;Creator&quot; or &quot;Intelligent Designer&quot;) in the primeval chemical &quot;soup&quot; 
	of this planet.</p>
	<p>Beyond that it is very important to understand that, while every detail 
	of the process of the <i>earliest emergence </i>of life hasn't yet been 
	fully worked out, scientists do know that life <i>evolved </i>after it 
	emerged. And as we will see, there is actually a great deal of concrete 
	evidence and proof of <i>how </i>this process has actually taken place over 
	the past 3.5 billion years.
