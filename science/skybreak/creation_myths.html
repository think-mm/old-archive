  <h2>Creation myths</h2>
	<p>One thing that all religions have in common is that they all tell 
	stories. The Christian Bible, the Jewish Tanak, the Muslim Koran, the 
	Buddhist Vedas, and so on, are all books of stories. Stories that people are 
	supposed to pass on through the generations. Stories that are supposed to 
	teach us how to live, and how not to live, our lives. Stories which were 
	told and retold to serve certain social and political agendas, to set down 
	rules of acceptable conduct.</p>
	<p>One of the most common types of religious stories all around the world is 
	called a &quot;creation myth&quot;: it is the story people tell of how the world, and 
	all the people and animals and plants, supposedly came to be. Every human 
	culture has tried to put together such an explanation, and in the absence of 
	scientific methods and knowledge every human culture has invoked some 
	supernatural forces to try to explain how we all got here and where we came 
	from. Here are just a few interesting samples:</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Ancient Babylonian Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>According to this Near Eastern myth (the Enuma Elish), which dates back 
	to around the 12th Century BCE, in the beginning there was only a watery 
	void and there was a male god of fresh water (Apsu) and a female god of salt 
	water (Tiamat). In time a younger god of lightning and thunder (Marduk) 
	killed Tiamat and split her body in two to form the heavens and earth.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Hopi Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>First there was Tawa the sun god and Spider Woman the earth goddess. 
	Spider Woman made all the people and other creatures out of clay deep inside 
	the earth and then guided them to the surface where Tawa the sun god 
	breathed life into them and dried the land.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Iroquois Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>The world was formed on the back of a giant turtle. First Woman fell from 
	the sky and lived with the help of the animals. She had one good grandson 
	and one bad grandson from which stemmed the conflict of good and evil among 
	humans.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Maya Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>According to this complex creation myth there are many gods and 
	goddesses; the earth is the flat back of a giant caiman (crocodile) floating 
	in a pool; heaven has 13 levels and the underworld 9 levels. A giant ceiba 
	tree anchors the heavens through to the underworld; human rulers are 
	embodiments of this tree, living links between the supernatural and natural 
	worlds. The whole world is destroyed and recreated every 500 years (the next 
	destruction cycle is due in 2012, according to traditional Maya mythology).</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Aztec Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>Also complex with many levels of heaven and underworld and many cycles of 
	repeated creation and destruction. But humans are living in the very last 
	cycle, after which there will be only oblivion.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Inca Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>Also lots of gods and goddesses, and repeated cycles of creation. 
	Ancestors are links to the supernatural world (bodies are preserved through 
	mummification); distinctive features in the physical world (mountain peaks, 
	rocky outcroppings, plants and pebbles, etc.) are inhabited by special 
	spirits (huacas) which humans can visit.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Ancient Egyptian Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>In the beginning, there was only water. Then Ra the sun god emerged out 
	of the water. Two of his children became the atmosphere and stood on the 
	shoulders of a third child, who became the earth; and then they all propped 
	up the 4th child who became the sky. Ra was the #1 god of Ancient Egypt, but 
	there were also many other gods and goddesses, including many which were 
	borrowed and incorporated from religions which were being practiced in other 
	lands during that period, and also some animal spirits which had been 
	adopted from even older African belief systems.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Indigenous Australian Creation Myths</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>According to this myth the earth was formed during the Dream-time and the 
	spirits emerged from the earth and roamed the land visiting water holes and 
	scattering about the spirits of unborn children. They taught the humans how 
	to live and then some went back down into the earth while others married 
	humans. People can conduct rituals to try to enter the Dreamtime and become 
	spirits themselves, retracing the past creation journey.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Inuit Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>A young woman married a seabird; her father tried to bring her home; the 
	bird dangerously stirred up the sea; the father tried to throw his daughter 
	out of his boat and when she tried to hold on he cut off her fingers -- her 
	severed joints then became all the important foods for the people (seals, 
	walruses, whales, etc.).</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Navajo Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>The Holy Ones carefully hung the stars in the sky and placed the plants 
	on the earth. But Coyote the Trickster god (representing chaos and defiance 
	of moral order) came out and scattered everything about, making a mess of 
	the world. Then he caused a great flood which brought humans up to the 
	surface world.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Scandinavian Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>According to the Scandinavian Eddas (from the 1200s BCE), in the 
	beginning there was a chaotic world which included gods, giants, and humans. 
	A great tree reached through time and space; it was attacked by a wicked 
	serpent, but under its roots was the fountain of wisdom. The God Thor helped 
	protect the humans from the giants.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Mali Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>A Creator made the universe and then withdrew. Spirit forces inhabited 
	the animals and plants. The first being was a toolmaker who was able to use 
	the earth and fire to make tools. Then he fell from heaven to earth and 
	broke into pieces. His elbow joint represents the ability to work. His 
	clavicle, shaped like a hoe, is a message humans should plant crops.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Ancient Greek Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>In the beginning there was Chaos, a dark void; out of it came the earth 
	and stars and clouds. There were innumerable gods. Prometheus, one of the 
	Titans, created people, designed to be superior to the mere animals his 
	brother had created. He made the people walk upright and he stole fire from 
	the god Zeus and gave it only to the people to use.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Hebrew and Christian Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>In the beginning there was a void. A few thousand years ago god made the 
	heavens and earth and then the people and all the animals. God made all the 
	living creatures separately, and in just six days; on the seventh day god 
	rested. God made first man, Adam, and first woman, Eve. They lived in a 
	state of bliss in a lush garden (the Garden of Eden) with dominion over all 
	the animals. There was a special tree (the tree of knowledge of good and 
	evil), and also a wicked serpent. The woman conversed with the serpent, 
	broke the rules, ate the forbidden fruit of that tree, and gave the fruit to 
	the man to eat. Because of this rule-breaking, both the woman and the man 
	were punished and were thrown out of the garden. First Man and First Woman 
	had one good son (Abel) and one bad son (Cain) and then Cain killed Abel. 
	Tired of the sinfulness of man, god created a giant flood to destroy the 
	whole world, allowing only Noah and the few humans and animals that could 
	fit into his boat to survive. All the living people and animals are 
	descendants of the only survivors of this flood.</p>
	<font face="Arial Narrow"><b>
	<p>Islamic Creation Myth</p>
	</b></font>
	<p>Islam is the youngest of the three major one-god believing (monotheistic) 
	religions in the world (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), which all 
	originated in the Middle East. All three share the same basic creation myth. 
	In Islam, as in the other two, a single all powerful god created nature out 
	of nothingness and made all of nature subservient to humanity in six days. 
	Adam was the first prophet, forgiven by a merciful god for his lapses. Each 
	element of creation (all the people, the plants, the animals) reflects a 
	specific set of divine rules and patterns. The created universe as a whole 
	is well ordered, with no gaps or discontinuities, and everything is in its 
	proper place. This very orderliness is itself proof of god.
