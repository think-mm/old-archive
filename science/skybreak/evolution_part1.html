		<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/24991">Our 
		Moderation team has decided</a> that Mukto-Mona will publish&nbsp; a 
		series of articles/debates/discussion on the science of evolution. These 
		articles will discuss the facts of evolution and the basic principles of 
		evolutionary theory. We all need to know at least the basic scientific 
		facts about evolution and understand also how the religious 
		fundamentalists who want to keep people ignorant and confused about 
		evolution are driven by a reactionary social and political agenda. </p>
		<p>In this context, we are publishing Ardea Skybreak's series on theory 
		of evolution that explains that all life forms on this planet are the 
		products of billions of years of evolution--from single-celled bacteria 
		to the most complex animals, including human beings--and that all 
		species have descended from other species and share common ancestors. 
		This series will also discuss why evolution is under relentless assault 
		by Christian fundamentalists and refute the antiscientific claims of 
		&quot;creationism&quot; and recent &quot;intelligent design&quot; about the origin and 
		development of life on the planet.</p>
		<p>These articles are aimed at anyone who simply wants to know the 
		truth. Readers are not expected to have a background in science to get 
		into these articles. We encourage our readers to send in comments or 
		specific questions. We also invite scientists and others with knowledge 
		to contribute to this discussion and to find ways to get the facts of 
		evolution out to as broad an audience as possible.</p>

	<p align="center"><b>**********************************</b></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Our planet, like all things, has a history. It is<i> 
	a history of change </i>--all sorts of dramatic changes, taking place over 
	billions of years. Changes have never stopped happening, and are still going 
	on.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So let me just start off by briefly going over a few 
	things that all modern scientists and most people who have had the 
	opportunity to learn basic scientific facts know to be true--as definitely 
	and undeniably true as the fact that the earth is not flat or that it goes 
	around the sun.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Our planet was birthed in some cosmic explosions 
	about 4.5 billion years ago, hurtling through space as a fiery ball of hot 
	rocks and gases, and settling into orbit around one of the many stars in the 
	cosmos--the one we call &quot;our&quot; sun. For the first billion years or so the 
	planet went through many physical changes--starting to cool down for one 
	thing--but there was no life.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Fast forward about a billion years: By then a lot of 
	things have changed in the physical composition of the planet: surface 
	temperatures have cooled considerably, and some land masses and water bodies 
	have begun to take shape. But temperatures are still fairly extreme, and the 
	waters and atmosphere are full of acids and poisonous gases.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In fact, if you could somehow go back in time about 
	3.5 billion years, you would have a hard time even recognizing our planet! 
	You would find no animals walking the land, no insects or birds in the 
	skies, no fish in the seas. You would find no grasses, no trees, no 
	flowering plants. You would find no familiar landmarks: none of the familiar 
	continents, mountain ranges, plains, or oceans of today. And you would find 
	no fresh water to drink, absolutely nothing you could eat, and you couldn't 
	even breathe the air which didn't yet have any oxygen.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But if you'd known where to look 3.5 billion years 
	ago (and could have somehow protected yourself from the extreme temperatures 
	and poisonous atmosphere!) you might have found the very first forms of life 
	on this planet. You would have had to look closely, because life wouldn't 
	have looked like much back then--imagine something like microscopic clumps 
	of organic molecules coming together and forming very stripped-down versions 
	of living cells, simpler in structure even than modern-day seaweeds or 
	bacteria. A kind of chemical &quot;soup,&quot; alive only in the sense that these new 
	little tidbits of matter could do two things that non-living things cannot 
	do on their own: actively draw in energy from the outside environment 
	(allowing them a means to actively grow and develop, as well as a basic 
	means to cause transformations of that outside environment) <i>and 
	replicate,</i>or make new copies of themselves.
	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="(See &quot;The Earliest Emergence of Life&quot;)" href="earliest_emergence_life.htm">(See &quot;The Earliest Emergence of Life&quot;)</a></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">If you dig down into the earth today, you can find 
	fossilized (hardened and preserved) remnants of ancient creatures, many of 
	which no longer exist today. The oldest fossils which have been found are 
	the remnants of ancient bacteria which lived about 3.5 billion years ago.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Back to footnote 1" href="#Footnote 1">1</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="3"><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">OK, 
	but if the first forms of life on this planet were just simple things like</a> 
	bacteria, how the hell did we get here ? Or how about the elephants, or the 
	pine trees, or the grasses, or the parrots, or the mosquitoes? Even with 
	billions of years to work with, how could things &quot;get&quot; from bacteria to any 
	of those complex creatures? If life started out so simply (and in fact 
	fossils indicate that a wide variety of bacteria remained the only game in 
	town, so to speak, for about 1 billion years!),</font><i> why didn't life 
	just &quot;stay&quot; simple </i>? Why are there now <i>so many </i>different kinds of 
	plants and animals, and why are many of them so complex? And why aren't <i>
	all </i>the life forms that ever existed on this planet still around? Why, 
	for instance, did some creatures--like the dinosaurs or giant armadillos or 
	saber-toothed tigers and many other plant and animal species--go<i> extinct
	</i>? Why are more than 90% of all the species that ever lived gone? Why is 
	it that, as ancient fossils reveal, some creatures that lived millions of 
	years ago hardly ever changed over time (such as some species of 
	cockroaches, crocodiles, ginkgo trees or horseshoe crabs which seem nearly 
	identical to their fossilized ancestors from millions of years ago) whereas 
	most lineages (broad &quot;groupings&quot; of related plants or animals) changed 
	dramatically and repeatedly over those same millions of years? How does the 
	growing collection of hominid (human-like) fossils (as well as molecular DNA 
	evidence), prove that the lineage which eventually led to modern human 
	beings diverged (split) from an ancestor species which was also the ancestor 
	of modern-day chimpanzees and gorillas, and what can this evidence also tell 
	us about the defining features of that divergence?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As I hope to show in the course of this series, we 
	need the science of evolution to answer all these kinds of questions. In 
	fact, the <i>only </i>way we can answer these types of questions is if we 
	understand evolution.
	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="(See &quot;Not Everyone Wants You to Learn about Evolution.&quot;)" href="noteveryone.htm">(See &quot;Not Everyone Wants You to Learn about Evolution.&quot;)</a></font></p>
	<font face="Verdana">
	<p><font size="4"><b>So what is evolution anyway?</b></font></p>
	</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Many people have some misconceptions about what 
	evolution is and what it is not. In a most basic sense evolution is 
	&quot;change.&quot; But not just the kind of quantitative change that occurs when 
	something grows or expands or decays, but a more rich and complex kind of 
	qualitative change, the kind of change that produces novelty and 
	innovation--<i> new things </i>that have never before existed. And evolution 
	isn't so much about how <i>individual </i>things change, but about how whole
	<i>systems </i>change, over <i>time </i>and<i> over generations </i>.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In one sense, even non-living systems can &quot;evolve&quot; 
	as long as they meet certain criteria. Non-living systems which can be seen 
	to evolve over time include human<i> cultural systems </i>, such as 
	languages, traditions, musical styles, philosophies, car designs, computer 
	programs, and so on. Of course-- and this an important distinction--in 
	non-living <i>cultural </i>systems the <i>mechanism </i>of evolutionary 
	change (of replication, transmission, and modification of &quot;information&quot; over 
	a series of successive &quot;generations&quot;) is very different because it is not 
	based (as it is in living things) on DNA molecules and the mechanisms of 
	random <i>genetic </i>variation and inheritance (and if you don't know about 
	any of this yet don't worry--it should all become clearer a bit later on). 
	But such non- living systems do nevertheless &quot;evolve&quot; in ways that can be 
	very analogous to the processes of biological evolution. In fact, studying 
	basic principles of Darwinian biological evolution has actually helped 
	people better understand such things as the evolution of human languages, 
	engineering designs, and even the more basic and fundamental philosophical 
	principles underlying human creativity and innovation more generally. In 
	turn, stopping a moment to review what <i>all </i>systems that are capable 
	of evolving have in common can sometimes help people better understand the 
	more particular ways in which living (biological) systems have evolved, and 
	continue to evolve to this day.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana">
	<p><b><font size="4">What all evolving systems have in common</font></b></p>
	</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">To be able to &quot;evolve,&quot; a system (any system) first 
	has to be made up of some kind of distinct <i>populations </i>(groups) made 
	up of <i>&quot;varied individuals&quot;</i> (in other words, individual components 
	which are not all alike but which instead have <i>different </i>features or 
	characteristics).</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This is very important: without individual <i>
	variation </i>there cannot be evolution.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Then there has to be some kind of mechanism whereby 
	&quot;individuals&quot; can<i> pass on </i>at least some of their features to the next 
	generation. In other words, it has to be possible for descendants to somehow
	<i>inherit </i>some of that variation that exists between individuals.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This is also very important: without some way to 
	transmit variation (<i>heritability </i>) there can be no evolution.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Evolution is &quot;<i> descent with modification </i>.&quot; 
	Evolutionary change takes place not all at once but over many &quot;generations.&quot; 
	Evolution is said to have occurred (for reasons we will get into later) 
	whenever there are changes, from generation to generation, in the<i> 
	proportional representation </i>of the variant types of individuals in a 
	population (that is, whenever a change has occurred in the &quot;relative 
	numbers&quot; of &quot;variants&quot;--individuals having different characteristics--which 
	make up the population).</font><sup><font face="Verdana"><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Back to footnote 2" href="#Footnote 2">2</a></font></p>
	</sup>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So far all we have been discussing could apply to 
	both living and non-living systems. But how do we know for sure that such 
	processes actually take place in <i>living </i>(biological) systems? What do 
	we know about the particular ways in which living systems evolved over 
	billions of years and about how life <i>continues </i>to evolve? And how do 
	we now know for sure that every single life form on this planet, including 
	human beings, can be fully accounted for by the workings of evolution 
	without requiring any outside force or divine plan?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It's important to realize that, for most of human 
	history, human beings did not even know that life <i>had </i>evolved--and 
	people certainly had no idea that our most distant ancestors looked like 
	some kind of bacteria! In the ancient world and right up to the 19th 
	century, most people saw the world as a very <i>static </i>(unchanging) 
	place. They imagined that the different kinds of plants and animals they saw 
	around them looked pretty much exactly the way they'd <i>always </i>looked. 
	They had no way of knowing, as we do today, that the distant ancestors of 
	all frogs, for instance, were a kind of fish that had evolved a primitive 
	lung and stumpy leg-like fins that allowed them to spend some time out of 
	the water. Most people never imagined that the different kinds of living 
	creatures could in any way be <i>related </i>to each other, even though some 
	people had noticed that different creatures seemed to have pretty similar 
	skeletons or &quot;body plans.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Of course, people had always wondered why there were 
	so many different types of plants and animals, where they had come from, 
	where people had come from, and so on. But, for most of human history, 
	people just didn't have the scientific tools and methods to answer these 
	questions! So, in the meantime, people rather creatively made up stories, in 
	an attempt to explain what could not yet be understood.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Such imaginative stories--often called &quot;origin 
	myths&quot; or &quot;creation myths&quot;-- can be found at the very core of the different 
	religions in the world. The different myths have some basic features in 
	common though they also tend to incorporate some distinct local features 
	having to do with the particular region and time in which a given tribe or 
	people lived. But everywhere throughout human history people would tell each 
	other these stories and pass them on from generation to generation to try 
	explain how the world and &quot;the people&quot; (by which they usually meant 
	&quot;themselves&quot;) came to be.
	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="(See &quot;Creation Myths&quot;)" href="creation_myths.htm">(See &quot;<font size="3">Creation Myths</font>&quot;)</a></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">How can we really tell whether the stories contained 
	in various religious scriptures are true or not? And, on the other hand, how 
	can we tell if evolution is true or not?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The best way to determine the basic truth or 
	falsehood of an idea is to go out in the world and<i> test it </i>. This is 
	how human beings learn--we experiment, we manipulate and transform the 
	outside world, and in the course of doing this we uncover a lot of 
	information about the way things <i>actually </i>work, and about the 
	underlying processes and dynamics of things.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But the creation myths contained in various 
	religious scriptures the world over are stories that people are asked <i>not
	</i>to test for truth or falsehood but to accept and believe in simply as a 
	matter of unquestioned<i> faith </i>. Even the leaders of various religions 
	admit that ideas such as &quot;in the beginning God created the world and 
	everything in it&quot; cannot, by definition, be subjected to scientific testing 
	or any means of concrete human verification.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But there <i>is </i>plenty of concrete evidence to 
	suggest that these supernatural forces have actually never existed anywhere
	<i>except </i>as <i>ideas </i>in the<i> minds </i>of people, in the <i>
	stories </i>that people tell, in the <i>songs </i>people sing, in the <i>
	books </i>that people write, etc. So while science can only test and 
	investigate actual material reality, it is important to realize that the 
	content and history of all the different religions of the world--their own 
	origins and how they have changed over time, as well as the ways in which 
	they have attempted to explain the natural world and human society--<i> is 
	all part of that material reality that <b>can </b>be scientifically explored 
	and investigated </i>.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Take the Bible, for instance. The Bible is after all 
	a book. It was written thousands of years ago, by a series of different 
	human authors. The fact that human beings wrote the Bible explains a lot why 
	the Bible contains things which are simply factually not true. For instance, 
	according to the Bible the Earth is only a little more than 6,000 years old, 
	but in reality (as shown by modern scientific dating techniques) it is 
	actually closer to 4.5 <i>billion </i>years old!</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana">
	<p><font size="4"><b>Millions and billions of years</b></font></p>
	</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Science is not a religion. It does not accept things 
	on blind faith. It requires much concrete proof and evidence before 
	scientists can even reach any kind of consensus and agree among themselves 
	that something is true. We know the age of things because we now have a 
	great variety of scientific techniques which allow us to <i>date </i>just 
	about anything: so we can now calculate the age of the known universe or the 
	age of the earth as a whole; we can tell when individual mountain ranges 
	were formed, when whole continents drifted apart or collided, or when the 
	earth's whole climate underwent dramatic changes. We can date individual 
	rock layers, all sorts of fossilized plants and animals embedded in rocks, 
	and even tiny bits of organic material. Today we can even use the techniques 
	of modern molecular biology to track changes in DNA and RNA molecules over 
	time and to determine how far back certain significant genetic mutations and 
	major &quot;splits&quot; in evolutionary lines occurred! We can date how far back 
	whole new lines of plants or animals first appeared, or when long vanished 
	species went extinct!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is important to realize that it is only in the 
	past century or so that scientists have been able to figure out accurate and 
	direct dating techniques (and some of the newest &quot;molecular&quot; dating 
	techniques are only a few decades old!). So obviously, the authors of the 
	Bible and other ancient scriptures written a few thousand years ago would 
	have had no way of accurately dating the age of the earth or of figuring out 
	the sequential unfolding of plant and animal life on this planet. But today 
	scientists can get at least good ball-park figures for the age of just about 
	anything, and sometimes the results can be surprisingly precise and are 
	often <i>corroborated </i>(that is, cross-checked and verified) by using a 
	variety of different dating techniques<i> in combination </i>.

	</u></i>years old (that's 4500 million!); the first and simplest forms of 
	life (including the first bacteria) emerged on this planet about 3.5 billion 
	years ago; a huge diversification of all sorts of marine animals happened 
	about 540 million years ago (in a period referred to as the &quot;Cambrian 
	explosion&quot;); the first jawed fish, amphibians and insects, as well as ferns 
	and other land plants, all first appeared within the next 100 million years 
	or so. The land plants, insects and amphibians then diversified a lot, and 
	the first reptiles appeared around 350 million years ago. Then around 250 
	million years ago the reptiles in turn diversified a lot (including giving 
	rise to the first dinosaurs) and the very first mammals appeared. Around 200 
	million years ago the vegetation of the global landscape was still dominated 
	by palms, ferns, pine-tree like conifers and ginkgoes, but now the first 
	flowering plants appeared, and this was also when the first birds appeared. 
	We also know that the last dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago 
	but that all sorts of mammals, birds, flowering plants and pollinating 
	insects continued to diversify and spread around the globe. The most recent 
	major wave of extinctions before modern times (the fifth since the beginning 
	of life on earth) occurred when many of the largest mammals and birds went 
	extinct at the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age about 10,000 to12,000 years 
	ago--a time of dramatic climate changes with temperatures rising and 
	glaciers retreating and also a time when human activity and impact on 
	various environments likely increased.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">We also know that the hominid line diverged (split) 
	from its ape ancestors only a few million years ago (4 to 10 million by most 
	estimates, and probably closer to 4 than 10) and ended up producing a series 
	of different human-like bipedal (upright-walking) species. All but one of 
	these hominid lines eventually became extinct. The only species of hominid 
	still around today (our own species<i> homo sapiens </i>, to which all human 
	beings belong) dates back only about 100,000 (one hundred<i> thousand </i>) 
	years. While that might seem like a lot of years relative to an average 
	person's lifespan, when you think about what the mere 100,000 years that we 
	modern humans have been around looks like relative to the whole 3 1/2 <i>
	billion </i>year history of diversifying life on this planet (complete with 
	those repeated &quot;waves&quot; of species <i>diversification </i>and at least five 
	periods of &quot;<i> mass extinctions </i>&quot; of a huge proportion of all the 
	living creatures on the planet) the timespan occupied so far by our own 
	species really seems like little more than a drop in the bucket!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The fact that our own species has so far occupied 
	such a tiny sliver of history is brought home even more forcefully when we 
	reflect on the fact that human beings didn't even develop agriculture (which 
	ended up serving as a foundation for large and complex &quot;civilizations&quot;) 
	until only about 10,000 years ago!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The science of evolution and the development of 
	scientific dating techniques has allowed us to confirm once and for all that 
	the story of the origins of life told in the Genesis chapter of the Bible is 
	not in fact accurate. The Bible says that god created the earth and the 
	ancestors of all the plants and animals and people<i> in just six days </i>, 
	but we now know that it has really taken about <i>3 1/2 billion years </i>
	for life to get to where it is today from its simplest origins. The Bible 
	also says that all the different types of plants and animals (and our own 
	ancestors) appeared on Earth just a few thousand years ago and<i> all at one 
	time </i>, but we now know that many different kinds of plants and animals 
	appeared (and also disappeared) at many different junctures in the much 
	longer history of life on this planet. The Bible says that all the different 
	types of living plants and animals <i>remained completely unchanged </i>
	since the time of creation, but (as we shall see through the course of this 
	series) we now know beyond all reasonable doubt that </font><i>
	<font face="Verdana">brand new species of plants and animals which had never 
	before existed came into being repeatedly, and as modifications of the 
	species which existed before them.</font></p>
	<p></i><font face="Verdana">There is lots of evidence for all of this, as we 
	will see.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana">
	<p><b><font size="4">What the Fossils tell us</font></b></p>
	</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Fossils are like &quot;snapshots&quot; into the past. Fossils 
	are basically the preserved traces and remains of plants and animals which 
	died long ago but whose bodies got quickly covered up by soils and sediments 
	which later hardened into solid rock, thus sealing them in and preserving 
	them. For centuries now, scientists and others have been digging up millions 
	of fossils of all sorts, out of all sorts of rocks, from all over the world. 
	These fossils have provided concrete evidence of what many ancient plants 
	and animals looked like, and often also something about the environments in 
	which they lived. For instance, if you happen to be walking somewhere in a 
	forest, along a road-cut, or on a mountaintop that is hundreds of miles from 
	any ocean, and you start noticing that the ground under your feet is full of 
	little rock-like fossils which are easily recognizable as clams and other 
	seashells, you won't need a degree in geology or paleontology to realize 
	that it's a pretty good bet that right where you are standing was once-- 
	long ago--the bottom of an ancient sea! If you are lucky, you might even 
	find a trilobite or two--the fossilized remnant of a small marine 
	invertebrate which looked a bit like aquatic cockroaches. Something like 
	10,000 different species of trilobites lived in the Paleozoic period between 
	roughly 300 million and 400 million years ago, but they've now all gone 
	extinct, so we learn about them by studying their fossils. In fact, 
	collecting and studying fossil plants and animals provided people some of 
	the <i>first clues </i>that both environments and living creatures had <i>
	not </i>always been as they are today, so that life must in fact have 
	evolved over time.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Long before people came up with the sophisticated 
	modern dating techniques such as radiocarbon dating which allow us to 
	calculate the actual <i>age </i>of rocks and fossils, quite a few people had 
	started to figure out that all the different types of plants and animals 
	must not have appeared on earth all at one time. Even by the early 19th 
	century, it was pretty clear that some &quot;types&quot; of ancient plants and animals 
	had completely vanished from the earth, that some had first appeared very 
	long ago, and some much more recently, and that some types seemed to have 
	existed in the past for long stretches of time while other types seemed to 
	have vanished more quickly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Much of this kind of basic understanding that life 
	had probably evolved through different stages over time came about in the 
	18th and 19th centuries when early geologists and naturalists started trying 
	to scientifically study the ways soils and rock layers had accumulated over 
	time, and the physical forces which they realized must have caused 
	landscapes to change dramatically--but over almost inconceivably <i>long </i>
	periods of time--as when mountain chains had been pushed up or eroded back 
	down, or when valleys had been carved out by slowly advancing or retreating 
	sheets of ice. Realizing that <i>the physical surface of the earth itself 
	had changed tremendously over time </i>--and beginning to realize just how
	<i>long </i>it would necessarily have taken for many of these changes to 
	take place--caused some of the 18th- and 19th-century geologists and 
	naturalists to begin to suspect that there was simply no way the earth could 
	be as young as was said in the Bible. This dawning realization made many of 
	them very uncomfortable, because most of them had grown up believing in the 
	literal truth of everything that is said in the Bible. But the growing 
	amount of concrete evidence they were helping to collect could not be easily 
	denied.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">These early geologists also increasingly realized 
	that the surface of the earth in any one spot is sort of like a layer cake: 
	when soil and debris accumulates over time it eventually forms a rocky 
	layer. As time passes, more accumulation takes place, and so new (more 
	recent) layers accumulate on top of older (more ancient) layers. The 
	distinctive layers which accumulated in different periods of the earth's 
	past history actually look different enough that you can still tell them 
	apart, so digging through them is like digging back through time. The same 
	basic pattern of <i>&quot;geologic stratification,&quot;</i> as it is called, can be 
	found all around the world and this is what made it possible for the early 
	geologists to figure out the basic sequence of geological eras in earth's 
	history.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So this is what some of those early geologists and 
	other naturalists realized: the surface or top layer of the earth is the 
	most recent (or youngest) layer, and it sits on top of an older layer, which 
	sits on top of an even older layer, and so on through the ages until you get 
	to the very deepest (&quot;oldest&quot;) layers.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And then they realized something else which was very 
	important: different groups of plant and animal fossils always seemed to 
	reliably turn up in different rock layers in a predictably ordered<i> 
	sequence </i>. They saw that certain kinds of fossils were <i>always </i>
	found in rock layers of a certain age (as determined by the rock layer's 
	position in the overall geological sequence of layers), but that those same 
	fossils were <i>never </i>found in rock layers of a different age. And there 
	even seemed to be a pretty predictable sequence of <i>whole groups of 
	fossils </i>in some more recent layers having entirely &quot;replaced&quot; groups of 
	fossils found only in older layers. The early naturalists and geologists 
	were furthermore astonished to discover that this kind of <i>orderly 
	sequencing </i>(and correlation of certain types of fossils with only 
	certain kinds of rock layers) tended to hold up, again and again, wherever 
	they tried to dig! In fact, this sequencing was by and large so consistent 
	that quite a few of the early naturalists could impress their friends by 
	correctly guessing, upon being shown a fossil, in exactly which geologic 
	rock layer that particular fossil must have been found. They'd seen it 
	before, because </font><i><font face="Verdana">the same pattern of 
	succession held up, over and over, wherever anyone looked.</font></p>
	<p></i><font face="Verdana">What could account for such a reliably 
	predictable sequencing of the fossils? Since the early naturalists 
	understood that the different soil and rock layers had accumulated one on 
	top of the other over long periods of time (and were therefore themselves of 
	different ages), the fact that different types of fossils were associated 
	with different layers certainly suggested that living creatures must have 
	been different at different times and had somehow probably <i>changed </i>
	(evolved) over time. Once again, this dawning realization made many of them
	<i>very </i>uncomfortable, because it ran counter to the story of creation 
	as told in the Bible which they'd grown up with. Even as they kept 
	collecting more and more evidence which more and more strongly suggested 
	evolution <i>had </i>somehow occurred, many of them still tried hard to 
	figure out reasonable alternative explanations which would allow them to 
	continue to accept the Biblical notion that all living creatures appeared at 
	the same time and had remained essentially unchanged since the time of 
	divine creation.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But the evidence for evolution kept mounting, and no 
	amount of rationalization could make it go away.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="back to footnote 3" href="#Footnote 3">3</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">When it became clear from the fossil record that 
	different types of creatures had lived at different times in the earth's 
	history, some naturalists and others tried to reconcile this disturbing 
	realization with their Christian beliefs: they suggested that perhaps all 
	living creatures had been created by god, but that there had been not just 
	one but <i>repeated </i>acts of divine creation. Others didn't think that 
	was very plausible. The traditional view of the world as a very static place 
	full of things that never change really had started to break down. If the <i>
	physical face </i>of the planet had itself changed over time (the physical 
	forces involved in such things as mountain formation and the erosion of 
	valleys were beginning to be understood), could it be that the different 
	types of living plants and animals had also somehow been transformed over 
	time?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">These were the kinds of questions that some of the 
	more advanced naturalists were excitedly discussing among themselves in the 
	early years of the 19th century. And the more fossils were collected and 
	examined, the more such questions were posed. Naturalists were beginning to 
	see that there were<i> similarities, as well as differences </i>, among the 
	different types of fossils. What could account for this? Could it be that 
	the different fossil creatures were somehow related to each other? Could it 
	be that at least some of the types of creatures whose fossils could be dug 
	out of the lowest and oldest rock layers had actually not simply disappeared 
	without a trace but had, somehow, &quot;evolved&quot; into some of those creatures 
	whose &quot;similar-but-different&quot; fossils could be found in the upper (more 
	recent) rock layers?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The great naturalist Charles Darwin (along with his 
	contemporary Alfred Russell Wallace, who came up with the same basic 
	breakthrough idea at about the same time) caused a genuine revolution in 
	human thought and understanding when he wrote a book published in 1859 
	called<i> The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection </i>. This 
	book presented a great deal of concrete <i>evidence </i>that living 
	creatures <i>had </i>evolved over time. And Darwin went one giant step even 
	beyond that, developing a comprehensive theory and proposing <i>a concrete 
	mechanism </i>through which he thought evolutionary change could take place. 
	Darwin called this basic mechanism of evolutionary change in living 
	creatures &quot;<i> natural selection </i>&quot; and, in the more than 150 years since 
	he published his breakthrough theory, natural selection has actually been <i>
	proven </i>(again and again) to be one of the most crucial and fundamental 
	mechanisms through which life does, in fact, evolve.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The publication of Darwin's <i>The Origin of Species 
	by Means of Natural Selection </i>represents one of the most important 
	milestones in the entire history of human thought. Once again, what was 
	particularly significant about this event was that Darwin not only provided 
	lots of evidence <i>that </i>life had evolved (over extremely long periods 
	of time) but also proposed a mechanism (which could and would be<i> 
	repeatedly tested and verified by many other scientists over the succeeding 
	decades </i>) for <i>how </i>evolution could take place. He showed how 
	evolution by natural selection could unfold based <i>only </i>on the already 
	existing (and very variable) characteristics that could always be found 
	among individual living creatures, and in this way he demonstrated how 
	evolution could have taken place without any external guiding hand or divine 
	design having to be involved.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This was truly revolutionary, and certainly very 
	unsettling to anyone clinging to strictly Biblical views of divine Creation. 
	And yet within only a few years the majority of scientists pretty much 
	agreed that life <i>had </i>evolved. But whether life had evolved via the 
	mechanism of natural selection or by some other means continued to be hotly 
	debated for years. This was especially the case because in Darwin's time the 
	principles of inheritance were not yet understood, and so it wasn't really 
	clear yet exactly how living creatures &quot;passed on&quot; some of their variable 
	characteristics from one generation to the next. As we will discuss some 
	more later on in this series, it was not until almost the middle of the 20th 
	century that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was 
	definitively proven to be correct, when advances in the understanding of the 
	principles of inheritance and the discovery of genes and DNA (leading to the 
	development of the whole new science of genetics) made possible a better 
	understanding of how some of the variable characteristics of individuals are 
	not only passed on, but also &quot;reshuffled&quot; in new ways, from one generation 
	to the next. This new understanding made it possible to really concretely <i>
	test </i>how evolutionary changes take place in populations of plants and 
	animals (both in laboratories and in the wild), and the thousands and 
	thousands of experiments and observations made throughout the 20th century 
	ended up thoroughly verifying and <i>confirming </i>the basics of Darwin's 
	theory of natural selection once and for all.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana">
	<p><b><font size="4">So what did Darwin figure out?</font></b></p>
	</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">One thing about Charles Darwin is that he was very 
	observant and studied nature very closely. Like any good naturalist of his 
	day, he had seen fossils, and he was intrigued by both the similarities and 
	differences among different types of fossils, and by the fact that they 
	occupied predictable locations in different geologic layers. And he wondered 
	about why some creatures had vanished from the earth, and about what could 
	possibly explain the fact that he had himself been able to collect fossil 
	seashells miles from any ocean, high up on some mountain tops in the South 
	American Andes.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Besides fossils, Darwin also studied living 
	creatures, and he spent a great deal of time closely examining all sorts of 
	populations of snails, birds, flowering plants, ants, bees, farm animals, 
	and so on, both in his native England, and in many other parts of the world. 
	He had been given the chance of a life- time when he got a job as an 
	on-board ship naturalist on an explorer ship, the H.M.S.<i> Beagle </i>. As 
	the <i>Beagle </i>explored coastlines and dropped anchor to survey and 
	explore many exotic places, including in Latin America, the Pacific islands 
	and southern Africa, Darwin collected tons of detailed information about the 
	land formations and the many exotic plants and animals he encountered 
	wherever he went. He was only 22 and still himself a believer in Biblical 
	Creation when he started out on this trip. In fact, the captain of the ship 
	actually expected (and hoped) that Darwin would bring back evidence that 
	would <i>disprove </i>some of the new-fangled ideas about evolution that 
	many other European naturalists were starting to think about. Instead, 
	Darwin ended up bringing back evidence of evolution!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As Darwin explored, he was fascinated by the 
	diversity of species he encountered and by how well &quot;adapted&quot; (or closely 
	fitted or attuned) many species seemed to be in relation to the 
	particularities of the environments they occupied. For instance, he found 
	cactus plants whose water- preserving needle-like &quot;leaves&quot; seemed especially 
	well adapted to dry desert conditions, and in the Galapagos Islands he found 
	birds whose beaks seemed to be especially well adapted to the foods that 
	they ate--the species which fed on hard seeds had short and stout 
	seed-cracking bills (beaks), those that ate small seeds or insects had much 
	thinner pointier bills, and some that sucked nectar from flowers had thin 
	and curved, almost straw-like, bills.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In fact, Darwin found a series of finches (small 
	birds) which looked pretty much the same in size and color, and so on, but 
	which varied greatly from island to island in just such things as the size 
	and shape of their beaks, and which seemed to have somehow &quot;adapted&quot; to the 
	presence of different kinds of food sources on the different islands. And he 
	also noticed that all these different finch species seemed to share some 
	common features not only with each other but also with one single species of 
	finch which lived on the mainland, hundreds of miles away. This led Darwin 
	to speculate that some mainland individuals long ago might have managed to 
	fly to the islands and then separate populations of their descendants on the 
	different islands might have accumulated different kinds of changes, over 
	the generations, so that eventually each island ended up with a species of 
	finch which still had a lot in common with the type on the mainland and the 
	types on the other islands, but which also had striking differences as well. 
	Darwin's speculation--that the different finch species on the different 
	islands were all &quot;modified descendants&quot; from a single common ancestor 
	species living on the mainland which had at some point &quot;radiated&quot; (expanded) 
	from the mainland and then over time &quot;diversified&quot; into many different types 
	on islands having different environments--was later proven to be correct.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In the course of his travels Darwin also found lots 
	of odd species which had features they weren't using, like birds with webbed 
	feet that never went in the water, or penguins with wings that didn't fly. 
	He suspected (again correctly) that these apparently &quot;useless&quot; 
	characteristics might simply have been passed down to descendants from some 
	very different ancestors (Darwin would later be proven to be correct about 
	this, too). These kinds of clues are some of what convinced him that living 
	species must have changed over time--that they had indeed evolved.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">By the time Darwin came home, he was convinced that 
	evolution had occurred. But it would take him 22 more years to fully develop 
	a plausible mechanism for how evolution could have occurred (by natural 
	selection) and to have the guts to publish his findings, knowing full well 
	it would cause an uproar in religious circles and in society more broadly.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Darwin had lots of &quot;raw evidence&quot; of evolution he 
	had collected during his travels and observations. But to figure out the <i>
	mechanism </i>of evolution he would have to bring this evidence together 
	with two important concepts, the concept of <i>individual variation within 
	populations </i>and the concept of<i> selection of inheritable 
	characteristics </i>.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana">
	<p><b><font size="4">What Darwin learned about selection from farmers</font></b></p>
	</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Darwin had spent a lot of time talking to farmers, 
	and he knew about the kind of methods of selection that farmers have used 
	for thousands of years to improve their stocks of animals or crop plants and 
	to produce new varieties with more desirable characteristics. Farmers know 
	that some (though not all) of the features of animals and plants can be 
	passed on to their offspring (their young of the next generation) and that 
	farmers can themselves &quot;select for&quot; some of these inheritable 
	characteristics to improve their stocks. For instance, if they want a herd 
	of dairy cows that produce more milk, they should select out and breed 
	(allow to reproduce) <i>only </i>the individuals that produce the most milk. 
	And, at the next generation, they should repeat the process, again selecting 
	out and breeding only the best milk producers. Every farmer knows this. If 
	they keep doing this over some number of generations, they <i>will </i>end 
	up with a herd of cows made up mainly of better milk producers.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">You can do the same thing with pigs to get bigger 
	and meatier pigs, or with crop plants to get bigger or sweeter ears of corn, 
	for instance. Just select those animals, or those seeds of crop plants, that 
	have the <i>most </i>favorable characteristics (as long as those are 
	characteristics that can actually be passed on to offspring--since not all 
	characteristics can be passed on or inherited) and, generation after 
	generation, breed <i>only </i>those individuals that have those most 
	favorable characteristics. After a number of generations, your whole 
	&quot;population&quot; (herd of animals or fields of crops) will be made up <i>mainly
	</i>of individuals with those desirable features you were &quot;selecting for.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This kind of selection is called <i>artificial 
	selection </i>(to distinguish it from the kind of natural selection that 
	happens in the wild without human intervention), and in this way it is 
	possible not only to gradually change (&quot;improve&quot;) the features of particular 
	livestock and crop plants, but even sometimes to produce whole new 
	varieties, such as when a gardener manages to produce a whole new variety of 
	rose or a juicier tomato. Or just look at all the many varieties of dogs 
	which people have managed to produce through selective breeding over many 
	generations--an astonishing variety considering that <i>all </i>dog 
	varieties, from tiny Chihuahuas to German shepherds or Great Danes, are <i>
	all </i>descended from a <i>single </i>common wolf-like ancestor!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So Darwin knew about artificial selection by farmers 
	and other animal and plant breeders. But could something like that happen on 
	its own, in natural wild populations?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The big breakthrough about &quot;natural&quot; selection 
	happening on its own, in the wild, came about when Darwin realized two 
	things:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">First of all, animals and plants in the wild seem to 
	produce<i> many more offspring than can possibly survive </i>. This 
	suggested to Darwin that something generally must be <i>limiting </i>what 
	would otherwise be the endless expansion of organisms in the natural world. 
	He suspected organisms must be engaged in some kind of &quot;struggle for 
	survival&quot; through which only the most &quot;fit&quot; managed to survive and 
	reproduce. (What Darwin was getting at is what modern biologists refer to as 
	&quot;differential reproductive fitness.&quot; This is simply a measure of how some 
	organisms, in a given local environment, end up producing more offspring 
	which are themselves able to survive and reproduce. Such &quot;fitness&quot; does not 
	involve notions of any other kind of superiority.)</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Second, Darwin made the very important observation 
	that in any population of animals or plants, while all the individuals have 
	some features in common (which is what allows us to recognize them as 
	belonging to the same species in the first place),<i> no two individuals are 
	ever exactly alike </i>. Darwin realized that this natural <i>variability
	</i>between individuals in a population could provide a kind of &quot;raw 
	material&quot; for the entire population to change over successive generations 
	through a process of blind and unconscious &quot;natural selection&quot; of some of 
	those features over others, without people or gods having to be involved in 
	any way.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">To understand how natural selection works you have 
	to remember that individual organisms (individual plants or animals) don't 
	live in a vacuum. They live in the context of (and in interaction with) an 
	outside environment (which consists of <i>both </i>the &quot;physical&quot; features 
	of the outside world, like temperature and humidity, and the &quot;biotic&quot; 
	environment made up of all the other living plants and animals that occupy 
	that same environment). This outside environment--both physical and 
	biotic--is <i>always changing </i>. It's essential to remember that.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So, let's walk through an example of natural 
	selection in action. Let's say there's a population of plants or animals of 
	a certain species (let's call it species X). No two individuals in that 
	population will be exactly alike. Now imagine there's a lot of variability 
	between individuals for a feature which can be passed on to the next 
	generation (that is, for something that the offspring can inherit from their 
	parents). So far so good. OK, now imagine that this feature is something 
	that, in <i>that </i>particular environment at <i>that </i>particular time, 
	gives that individual a <i>&quot;reproductive edge&quot;</i> of some sort (relative to 
	those individuals which <i>don't </i>have that feature). This feature might 
	be something that allows individuals to simply live longer (so the 
	reproductive &quot;edge&quot; comes simply from having more time to produce more 
	descendants); or maybe it's a feature which allows individuals who inherit 
	it to be better able to withstand a drought or other dramatic change in the 
	environment; or maybe it's a feature that allows individuals having this 
	feature to be better than some of the others in their population at finding 
	more<i> food </i>, or<i> mates </i>, or<i> nesting sites </i>, or to be 
	better at <i>avoiding predators </i>--all of which can be helpful in making 
	it possible for an individual to end up producing more descendants (an 
	animal can't very well produce lots of descendants if it gets eaten before 
	it even gets a chance to reproduce!) .</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In real life, scientists have documented many such 
	examples of features giving individuals a &quot;reproductive edge&quot; compared to 
	individuals in the same populations that don't have such features. Whatever 
	the feature might be (and it could be just about anything as long as it's 
	something that can be passed on and <i>inherited </i>by offspring), if this 
	feature confers on an individual some kind of overall reproductive advantage 
	(meaning nothing more than that individuals who have that feature will 
	produce more descendants than individuals in the same population who <i>
	don't </i>have that feature) then those descendants will in turn tend to 
	produce more offspring that have that feature, and over a series of 
	generations that feature will tend to spread, and generally will come to 
	predominate in the population as a whole. In this way we can say that the 
	population has &quot;evolved.&quot;<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Back to footnote 4" href="#Footnote 4">4</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Let's take another example: let's say you have a 
	population of insects of one type and these insects get preyed upon (get 
	eaten) by a species of bird. And let's say <i>most </i>of the individual 
	insects in that population are drab-colored and tasty but, purely by chance, 
	a few of the insects in that population happen to have bright and noticeable 
	black and yellow colors along with a stinger full of venom which makes them 
	toxic to the birds. The birds will quickly learn to avoid the brightly 
	colored poisonous insects and to feed mainly on the drab venomless ones. 
	Now, if that happens, the bright venomous ones will obviously have<i> a 
	better chance on average of surviving and producing offspring than the ones 
	which didn't have these features </i>. As a result, the next generation will 
	be made up of <i>a greater proportion </i>of (you guessed it) brightly 
	colored venomous insects.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Repeat the process generation after generation (at 
	each generation the brightly colored venomous insects get to leave a greater 
	number of descendants than the drab non-venomous ones.) After a number of 
	generations, the whole population will look different! Now the whole 
	population will be entirely (or almost entirely) made up of brightly colored 
	venomous insects, for no reason other than that is the kind of individual 
	that got to leave more descendants at each successive generation. Through 
	what is called the &quot;differential reproduction&quot; of these &quot;variable 
	individuals&quot; the whole population has changed--it has evolved!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Here's another example many people may be familiar 
	with: the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Take a population 
	of bacteria that causes some disease. Expose them to antibiotics which kill 
	bacteria. Many of them will die. Let's say <i>most </i>of the bacteria are 
	killed by the antibiotic, but<i> a few </i>, purely by chance, happen to 
	have some feature which allows them to survive the antibiotic and they go on 
	to reproduce and pass on this &quot;antibiotic-resistant&quot; feature to their 
	descendants. So maybe you give the patient more of the same antibiotic, but 
	now those antibiotic-resistant bacteria survive the attack and go on to 
	produce more generations of resistant bacteria. Now you have a big problem: 
	after a number of generations (and bacteria produce new generations <i>very
	</i>quickly in a host body!) the only bacteria left will be the resistant 
	kind, and they will reproduce unchecked. Unless you can come up with a <i>
	different </i>antibiotic, which these bacteria are not yet resistant to, a 
	patient could end up with a life- threatening &quot;galloping infection&quot; as the 
	bacteria that nothing can seem to kill start to overrun the patient's body.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So a big problem these days is that the excessive 
	and careless use of some antibiotics has led to the emergence of a number of 
	strains of bacteria (including new strains of tuberculosis) which so far are 
	resistant to <i>all </i>known antibiotics. </font><i><font face="Verdana">
	This is a classic case of evolution in action, and there is no way for 
	advances to be made in the science of treating contagious diseases unless we 
	apply to medicine our understanding of evolutionary principles.</font></p>
	<p></i><font face="Verdana">What I have just described in basic terms is the 
	mechanism of evolutionary change that Darwin discovered and named natural 
	selection. There is absolutely zero doubt among modern scientists that this 
	kind of evolutionary change (sometimes called microevolution to distinguish 
	it from larger scale macroevolutionary changes, which we will also discuss 
	more later in this series) occurs within <i>all </i>living populations and 
	species--not &quot;instantly,&quot; but over many generations--and that this kind of 
	evolutionary change is extremely commonplace. It has been observed in real 
	life time and time again, in populations of all sorts of different kinds of 
	plants and animals, both in the wild and in the laboratory.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana">
	<p><font size="4"><b>Has Darwin's theory of natural selection really been 
	tested and proven to be true?</b></font></p>
	</font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Yes, and many times over. Darwin himself never got 
	to witness the final definitive proof of his theory, because during his 
	lifetime scientists had not yet been able to discover <i>the source of the 
	individual variation </i>which Darwin knew was so crucial to his theory. 
	Darwin understood that organisms do <i>not </i>pass on to their descendants 
	features which they have <i>acquired during the course of their lifespan </i>
	(for instance, if you work out at the gym and acquire big muscles, you will 
	not pass these on to your children; or if a giraffe stretches its neck to 
	reach leaves in high tree branches day after day, it still will not give 
	birth to baby giraffes with longer necks). But for Darwin's theory of 
	evolution by natural selection to work, <i>something </i>had to be passed on 
	to successive generations-- there had to be some mechanism whereby 
	descendants could inherit some of that &quot;favorable variation&quot; found in their 
	parents. What could that be?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It took less than 100 years after Darwin's time for 
	scientists to figure out the answer by working out the basic principles and 
	mechanisms of <i>inheritance </i>and by discovering the basic structure of
	<i>genes </i>and<i> DNA </i>. This missing piece of the puzzle provided 
	definitive proof of Darwin's basic mechanism of evolutionary change through 
	natural selection (this was accomplished through, among other things, 
	countless experiments involving fast-reproducing animals, such as fruit 
	flies, in whose populations evolutionary changes and underlying genetic 
	changes over multiple generations could readily be observed).</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In future installments of this series, we will 
	review some more examples of the concrete evidence which has provided 
	definitive proof of how evolutionary change by natural selection happens 
	over time within species, and also how evolutionary change can take place 
	through both cumulative effects of natural selection and some additional 
	associated processes to give rise to whole new types (species) of plants or 
	animals--a process referred to as speciation. Darwin himself was very 
	interested in factors leading to the emergence of whole new species, and his 
	work provided a very good initial foundation for understanding how new 
	species can in fact emerge as modifications of previously existing species. 
	In the century and a half since Darwin, scientists have been able to both 
	confirm and reaffirm the basic principles of evolution by natural selection 
	and to further extend and develop evolutionary theory in many important 
	directions on the basis of this Darwinian foundation.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">There have been many advances made since Darwin's 
	time which allow us to better understand how life can diversify and whole 
	new species emerge when, for instance, separate populations of a given 
	animal or plant species undergo evolutionary change to differing degrees 
	and/or at different rates in different localities. There are a number of 
	reasons why such differences might exist between different populations of a 
	given plant or animal species: certain features conferring a reproductive 
	advantage (and thus &quot;selected for&quot;) in one environment might confer a 
	reproductive &quot;disadvantage&quot; in a related population which happens to occupy 
	a different environment; the type and amount of genetic variation present in 
	one given population might also be different than in another related 
	population simply because of phenomena like &quot;genetic drift&quot; and &quot;founder 
	effects,&quot; especially in small and isolated populations.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Back to footnote 5" href="#Footnote 5">5</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Sometimes geographically and reproductively separate 
	populations will evolve along different lines because different local 
	environments &quot;favor different features,&quot; and sometimes just because the 
	amount of genetic variation available for selection at the start, within the 
	separate populations, just happened to be only a small fraction of what was 
	available in the species as a whole.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Over time, as local populations go through local 
	changes they can sometimes end up becoming sufficiently different from their 
	ancestor population, and from what characterizes the species as a whole, 
	that they actually become a new species.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Back to footnote 6" href="#Footnote 6">6</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">New species can and do emerge in this way, and this 
	kind of evolutionary change has taken place throughout the history of life 
	and continues to do so. The evolution of life on this planet should be 
	thought of not as a straight-line process but as a branching bush, with some 
	relatively short twigs (evolutionary dead-ends) and relatively longer twigs 
	and branches giving rise to lots more lines of &quot;descent with modification 
	from a common ancestor,&quot; as Darwin so aptly characterized the process.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Today Darwinian theory continues to be extended and 
	further developed. The &quot;new frontiers&quot; in the development of the science of 
	evolution<i> are not calling into question the basics of Darwinian natural 
	selection </i>; they are <i>adding </i>to classical Darwinism by exploring 
	some additional and related concepts to more fully understand larger scale 
	(macroevolutionary) changes-- including the emergence of new species and 
	orders of plants and animals over millions of years, as well as the 
	differential extinction or survival of whole large groupings of plants and 
	animals at different junctures in earth's history.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">For instance, there is quite a bit of interest these 
	days in understanding better what factors may have led to periods of 
	especially intense diversification of evolutionary lineages in relatively 
	short timespans (by geological standards), such as the famous &quot;Cambrian 
	explosion&quot; of a little more than 500 million years ago. And there is great 
	interest in better understanding the kinds of factors which can lead to 
	major overhauls of life on the planet through mass extinctions: the five 
	major waves of mass extinctions in the history of life on this planet (up to 
	this point) occurred at the end of the Ordovician period (roughly 450 
	million years ago); at the end of the Devonian (around 350 million years 
	ago); at the end of the Permian (around 250 million years ago, when a great 
	many life forms, especially in the oceans, went extinct); at the end of the 
	Cretaceous (around 65 million years ago, when many different lineages, 
	including the last of the dinosaurs, went extinct quite likely due to the 
	devastating effects on global climate and vegetation following the impact of 
	a large asteroid which hit the Yucatan peninsula); and finally at the end of 
	the Pleistocene, or the last great Ice Age (which lasted about 2 or 3 
	million years and ended about 10 to 12 thousand years ago) during which many 
	species of large mammals and birds became extinct, possibly due at least in 
	part to the actions of human hunters.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Factors such as major global climate changes, the 
	impact of an asteroid forceful enough to create a sort of &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; 
	and more recently the impact of widespread hunting and environmental 
	transformation by human beings have all been considered to have contributed 
	to periods of mass extinctions, when large proportions of living plants and 
	animals were driven over the evolutionary brink and completely vanished. 
	Some scientists (such as Richard Leakey) today argue that we are actually 
	already seeing the beginning of the <i>sixth </i>wave of mass extinctions, 
	one directly attributable to the extremely rapid and domino-like effects of 
	the environmental destruction and depredation caused by human beings just in 
	the last couple of centuries or so.
	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="(See &quot;The Continued Existence of Life on This Planet Is Not a Given&quot;)" href="continuedexist.htm">(See &quot;<font size="3">The Continued Existence of Life on This Planet Is Not a 
	Given</font>&quot;)</a></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Some of the more exciting questions which are being 
	explored by Darwinian scientists today include issues of rhythm and pacing 
	of large-scale evolutionary changes. All evolutionists agree that the 
	accumulation of small-scale evolutionary changes within species is a 
	continual, ongoing, process. And, as we will discuss elsewhere in this 
	series, there is also plenty of evidence of the gradual accumulation of 
	evolutionary change through natural selection giving rise to major 
	transformations at the species level (and, contrary to what the Creationists 
	might think, there is actually quite a bit of fossil and other preserved 
	evidence of &quot;intermediate&quot; stages marking different steps in such 
	development). But, <i>in addition </i>to the well-known evidence of gradual 
	evolutionary change in animal and plant lineages, a number of scientists 
	have been recording evidence strongly suggesting that major evolutionary 
	&quot;leaps&quot;--including the relatively sudden emergence of new species or 
	relatively sudden bursts of diversification of whole groups of plants and 
	animals--can, under certain conditions, take place relatively quickly, at 
	least in terms of the geological timescale. I emphasize &quot;relatively&quot; and &quot;in 
	terms of the geological timescale&quot; because it is important to understand 
	that no one is suggesting that major evolutionary &quot;innovations,&quot; and the 
	appearance of whole new species and/or lineages, somehow happens 
	&quot;overnight.&quot; No, everyone is still talking about major changes taking place 
	over many, many generations! But what many evolutionists are debating among 
	themselves these days is whether major evolutionary developments on a 
	macro-scale (including the occasional &quot;bursts&quot; of intense species 
	diversification which have punctuated the history of life on earth) could at 
	least sometimes have happened <i>relatively </i>suddenly, in a geologically 
	very concentrated period--as opposed to over millions and millions of 
	years--though of course still over many successive generations.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As we will see later in this series, the pacing of 
	evolutionary change even within living species is far from constant and can 
	at times become greatly accelerated, especially in populations of plants or 
	animals encountering rather sudden and dramatic environmental disturbances 
	and/or finding themselves cut off and isolated from the larger intermingling 
	gene pool of their species. Under such conditions, even relatively small 
	evolutionary innovations can sometimes have greatly magnified effects, and 
	it appears that new species often originate in just such a fashion.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So there is a lot of interest these days in 
	deepening the scientific understanding of the kind of factors which might 
	affect the <i>rate and tempo </i>of evolutionary change, including rates of 
	speciation and conditions under which one evolutionary line ultimately might 
	end up branching out (diversifying) into many different descendant lineages, 
	or perhaps only a few. There is also a lot of constructive interest in 
	debating the <i>relative importance </i>of natural selection and 
	non-selective factors such as random genetic drift, founder effects, or the 
	random effects of catastrophic environmental events (such as the impact of 
	an asteroid striking the earth) on the emergence of evolutionary &quot;novelty.&quot;<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Back to footnote 7" href="#Footnote 7">7</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The point is not to attempt to dig into all this 
	here but just to point out that these are the <i>types </i>of questions that 
	the dynamic field of evolutionary biology is delving into these days. Many 
	exciting breakthroughs are being made, <i>both in theory and experimentally
	</i>, which continue to extend and further develop Darwin's legacy. <i>But
	</i>saying that the field of evolution is continuing to develop is 
	definitely <i>not </i>the same thing as saying that &quot;evolutionists can't 
	agree among themselves and therefore evolution remains just an unproven 
	theory, and the creationist theory is a just-as-valid alternative theory,&quot; 
	as the Creationists often like to argue. Nothing could be further from the 
	truth.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Once again, the basic principles of Darwinian 
	evolution by natural selection are considered to be as solidly proven today 
	as the fact that the Earth goes around the sun and not the other way around. 
	Scientific knowledge is, of course, always expanding and developing. But new 
	advances in science (or in any other field of knowledge) will be realized 
	only if we <i>base ourselves </i>firmly on the accumulated knowledge which 
	has already been clearly demonstrated to be true and which has stood the 
	test of time. There is absolutely nothing that is more solidly proven and 
	demonstrated in all of science (and that includes in any field of science) 
	than the basic principles of evolution.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Later in this series, after we've had a chance to 
	get some further grounding<b> </b>in what evolution is, what it is not, and 
	what evidence there is that evolution actually has taken place and that life 
	is continually evolving, I hope we will all be more confident in being able 
	to see what is wrong with the arguments of the so-called &quot;scientific 
	creationists&quot; who try to argue that they have &quot;scientific&quot; reasons for not 
	believing in evolution. As we will see, so-called &quot;scientific creationism&quot; 
	is not science at all! It is simply religion: a set of beliefs Biblical 
	literalists would like us to accept, not on the basis of any concrete and 
	verifiable scientific evidence (they have none!) but <i>simply on the basis 
	of faith.</i></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is important to study and reflect on the favorite
	<i>methods </i>employed by Creationists when they &quot;challenge&quot; evolution, 
	because their very methods reveal on what shaky ground they are.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Creationists ask us to believe the Biblical story of 
	creation as literal truth (in opposition to the worked out and repeatedly 
	tested theory of evolution) but, unlike evolutionists, Creationists not only 
	cannot provide any evidence--they cannot provide any ideas that could 
	possibly be tested in the real world to determine the truth or falsehood of 
	their divine creation proposal. That in itself should tell you something! By 
	contrast, the theory of evolution has been repeatedly <i>tested </i>in the 
	real world (through observation and experimentation) and many of the 
	advances in all the modern sciences are very strongly rooted in an 
	understanding of its principles.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In addition, like any good scientific theory, the 
	theory of evolution is open to challenge and to being falsified or proven 
	wrong. What does this mean? It means that when scientists have a theory 
	about something, they make predictions about how, if the theory is TRUE, 
	then it should be possible to find such and such evidence. But they also 
	indicate what kinds of evidence would be incompatible with the theory and 
	would prove the theory to be FALSE. <i>The amazing thing about the theory of 
	evolution is that in the more than 140 years since Darwin published his 
	major breakthrough theory, thousands of scientists from all over the world 
	have been able to collect literally tons of evidence of different sorts 
	which is compatible with and demonstrates the truth of evolution theory, but 
	no one--not a single person anywhere--has been able to come up with a single 
	shred of concrete scientific evidence (of the kind that serious scientists 
	can go out and verify for themselves) that would show the theory of 
	evolution to be false. </i>And that, my friends, should also tell you 
	something. Especially since (as many other people have pointed out) anyone 
	who could somehow manage to prove the theory of evolution to be false would 
	become an overnight celebrity for having been able to overturn one of the 
	most solidly held facts in all of science!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is important to understand that the theory of 
	evolution is not about one or two simple points: is a coherent theory made 
	up of <i>many </i>different key components which all fit together into a 
	comprehensive whole. If someone could somehow show any of the key 
	fundamental components of the theory to be wrong (for instance, by finding 
	fossil evidence that humans lived at the same time as dinosaurs, to use just 
	one of millions of possible examples of something which, if found, would be 
	completely incompatible with our understanding of how evolution has actually 
	taken place) then the whole theory would go tumbling into oblivion! And yet, 
	in all the time since Darwin, despite the fact that fanatical Creationists 
	would probably do just about anything to find any actual shred of scientific 
	proof that evolution is wrong, nobody has been able to do this.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In the absence of <i>any </i>concrete evidence with 
	which to disprove the theory of evolution or validate the idea of Biblical 
	Creation, by any means other than blind faith, and without being able to 
	propose any serious and <i>testable </i>alternate scientific theory of their 
	own, Creationists have been reduced to just trying to &quot;punch holes&quot; in areas 
	of evolutionary theory they think of as &quot;weak&quot;--often because they don't 
	understand it in the first place! More often than not, it seems that their 
	attacks on evolutionary theory do not stem from principled disagreements but 
	are instead just attempts to create confusion among people who have not 
	received much scientific education, to give them a false impression that 
	maybe the theory of evolution is not on such solid ground after all.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><i>To create this false impression Creationists rely 
	on smoke and outright lies.</i> No matter how often the evolutionists answer 
	their lies and distortions, Creationists just keep coming up with more lies 
	and distortions. The famous paleontologist and evolutionist Stephen Jay 
	Gould<b> </b>commented that it can be very difficult to beat the 
	Creationists in a debate, precisely because of their unscientific and 
	slippery methods, although in another setting, such as a courtroom, where 
	they can be pinned down more and forced to put forward their <i>own </i>
	explanation of things, they can be demolished. After all, Creationists have 
	no scientific standards of truth to stick to, so there's nothing to keep 
	them from saying just about anything their twisted imaginations can come up 
	with in the hopes of &quot;wearing down&quot; the scientists (who are often frustrated 
	at having to waste time answering these mad idiots) as well as the general 
	public, among whom the double burden of religious tradition and lack of real 
	scientific education often makes it difficult to sort out truth from 
	fiction.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">To really see through the smoke and mirrors put up 
	by the Creationists, it is necessary to get some grounding in the basic 
	scientific method, as well as basic facts about evolution. This may be a 
	struggle, but it is definitely worth it. It will take some effort (because 
	learning about the science of evolution is a little like learning about the 
	science of everything!) but hopefully this series will be able to help with 
	this process. Through grappling with what we will be getting into and 
	&quot;walking through&quot; in the course of this series, it should be possible, even 
	if you started out unfamiliar with evolution, to acquire a basic 
	understanding of the scientific facts and then to build on 
	that--increasingly developing the ability to see through the smoke and 
	mirrors used by any anti-evolution proponents of blind faith. And then maybe 
	you'll have some fun and challenge<i> them </i>!</font></p>

	whether primitive life may have emerged and then perhaps &quot;petered out&quot; (and

	to better save themselves at least for a while, and would have kept swimming 
	and died a bit later on, so that's how they got buried in the upper layers 
	of mud. And of course the flying birds would have perched in the treetops 
	and so would have been among the last to die when the Flood waters rose, 
	according to some of these Creationists; so, they argue, that must be why 
	bird fossils appear only in the upper-most geologic layers! Yea, right..</a>.<br>

	Traditional Creationists make up many such laughable &quot;explanations&quot; as they 
	try to cling to their outdated beliefs, but today very few people, even 
	among devout Christians, can bring themselves to take such fanciful ideas 
	seriously. Among other things, geologists studying landscapes and the 
	formation of rock layers and continents have long understood that there has 
	never been a single global flood as described in the Bible . And even before 
	Darwin, geologists understood that the layers of the earth had been 
	deposited one on top of another over hundreds of millions of years and that 
	the fossilized plants and animals trapped within these different layers had 
	died in these very different geological eras, spread out over these millions 
	of years, and could obviously not have died all at once or even over a short 
	(40 day!) period of time.<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#back to footnote 3">

	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 4">4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not mean, 
	however, that the evolutionary change that has taken place will necessarily 
	become permanently generalized within the population or continue in a single 
	&quot;direction.&quot; For instance, evolutionary change could accumulate in a certain 
	seeming &quot;direction&quot; for a period of time but then a change in environmental 
	conditions could lead to trends being reversed if the feature in question no 
	longer brought individuals any reproductive advantage or even became 
	disadvantageous. If so, over generations, the feature could actually get 
	selected &quot;out&quot; (eliminated from the population altogether). Variable 
	features in a population which may have somewhat less dramatic positive or 
	negative effects on the relative reproductive fitness of individuals may 
	simply persist in the overall variable mix of the population without being 
	either completely eliminated or completely generalized to all individuals, 
	but with their relative proportions or frequencies changing from generation 
	to generation and in relation to changes in the external environment.</a><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">&nbsp;</a><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#Back to footnote 4">

	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 5">5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Genetic drift and 
	founder effects are related phenomena which refer to random changes in the 
	gene frequencies and overall genetic diversity of populations, due purely to 
	chance occurrences and which are not the result of natural selection. For 
	example, founder effects can occur when new individuals come into an area by 
	migration, introducing some new genetic material into a population. Overall 
	gene frequencies in a population can also change through random genetic 
	drift, simply because of such things as accidental deaths of individuals, or 
	because some of the total genetic material available within a population 
	gets severely reduced when part of a population gets wiped out or just gets 
	&quot;cut off&quot; and reproductively isolated from the larger source population. Not 
	surprisingly, the effects of such non- selective factors as random genetic 
	drift and founder effects on overall evolutionary change can be amplified 
	and particularly pronounced in especially small populations.</a><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none">&nbsp;</a><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#Back to footnote 5">

	being investigated having to do with the contributions to evolutionary 
	change made by so-called &quot;neutral&quot; mutations; and attempts are being made to 
	evaluate how much large-scale evolutionary change is the result of the 
	cumulative effects of the specific adaptations of populations of organisms 
	to their environments vs. how much may actually not be all that much related 
	to adaptation.</a><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other interesting questions in the field include such things as: Does 
	evolutionary change necessarily lead to an increase in complexity? Do the 
	same basic principles of natural selection apply at a number of different 
	levels of organization (such as genes, cells, individual organisms, 
	populations, species, clades); if so are some levels more significant than 
	others in terms of being principal sources and vehicles of major 
	evolutionary change? Can the theory of evolution be further developed and 
	integrated to encompass change operating simultaneously on a number of 
	different levels?<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#Back to footnote 7">
