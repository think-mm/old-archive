	<p><b><font size="4" face="Verdana">A Few Words about Adaptation</font></b></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Many evolutionary changes represent <i>adaptations
	</i>of organisms to changing external environments, though not all 
	evolutionary change is adaptation.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote1" href="#Footnote text 1">1</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Adaptation is a process which takes place over time. 
	It refers to the development of what often appears to be an amazingly tight 
	&quot;fit&quot; between certain characteristics of organisms and the environments in 
	which they live--a kind of &quot;fine tuning&quot; of species to environments which 
	frequently results from natural selection operating over many successive 
	generations. Examples of adaptations in nature are as numerous as they are 
	wonderful. Camouflage is a good example. Many mammals in the Arctic (such as 
	polar bears, arctic foxes, and so on) are camouflaged by their white fur 
	which makes them harder for predators to see against the background of white 
	snow; some insect species are difficult for bird predators to find because 
	they have evolved to look almost exactly like plant leaves, or twigs, or 
	pieces of bark!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The evolution of organisms which derive a 
	reproductive advantage by being &quot;mimics&quot; of other species is another example 
	of the evolution of adaptations: For instance, some insects have black and 
	yellow bands that make them <i>look </i>like bees and wasps, even though 
	they don't really have any venom and would be perfectly tasty for birds or 
	other predators to eat--birds are &quot;fooled&quot; into leaving them alone! 
	Remember, there is no consciousness involved with any of this--the insect 
	bee-mimics don't know they are fooling the birds. It's just that individual 
	insects that happened to have these kinds of markings on average did better 
	at surviving and producing descendants than those in the same species that 
	didn't have such markings. So, over a number of generations, natural 
	selection led to the bee-like markings spreading to all (or almost all) the 
	individuals in the population. There are many such species of mimics among 
	different kinds of organisms: many insects that lack venom have the markings 
	of bees and wasps; non-venomous king snakes look almost exactly like the 
	very venomous coral snakes, etc.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But then, if &quot;mimicking&quot; poisonous animals can 
	provide such a reproductive advantage, why haven't <i>all </i>the insect 
	species evolved the black and yellow &quot;warning colorations&quot; of bees and 
	wasps, for instance? This is an important question to reflect on. The answer 
	is basically that evolution can <i>only </i>work with whatever raw material 
	(genetic variability) happens to be at hand-- there is no guarantee that any 
	given population will have inherited from the preceding generation the kind 
	of genetic information required for certain particular features to emerge, 
	no matter how advantageous those features might turn out to be in the 
	abstract. For instance, it might objectively be advantageous for human 
	beings to be able to fly by flapping their arms, but humans just don't have 
	the basis in their underlying genetic &quot;kit&quot; for that particular capability 
	to emerge. So there's <i>no way </i>natural selection could lead to the 
	evolution of flight in humans, <i>even if </i>it could somehow be shown that 
	it would benefit human survival and reproduction. The biologist Doug Futuyma 
	(who has written excellent college textbooks on evolution, as well as a very 
	good book for broader consumption--<i> Science on Trial, the Case for 
	Evolution </i>) has an even better example: he makes the point that it would 
	no doubt be very advantageous for animals to be capable of <i>photosynthesis
	</i>(the method by which plants derive energy from the sun to produce 
	carbohydrates) if only because it would always provide an extra source of 
	reliable nourishment when regular food is scarce. So, <i>if there were any 
	possible way </i>that an ability to photosynthesize could emerge in <i>any
	</i>animal population, it would likely be heavily &quot;selected for&quot; by natural 
	selection, and would spread rapidly across the generations. But no matter 
	how advantageous this might be, it will <i>never </i>happen! Again, this is 
	because no animals have ever inherited from any of their animal ancestors 
	any of the genetic information required to make the machinery of 
	photosynthesis, which evolved only in plants.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So, in an animal line, no amount of genetic 
	reshuffling and recombination of genetic material inherited from an 
	immediately preceding generation could bring forth a feature for which the 
	basic building blocks don't even exist--again, no matter how advantageous it 
	might be! This is yet another illustration of the important point that 
	evolution can only work with what is already available--the genetic 
	variability inherited from previous generations--and that evolutionary 
	pathways (including the emergence of true evolutionary &quot;novelties&quot;) are 
	therefore significantly <i>constrained </i>(both <i>channeled </i>and<i> 
	limited </i>) by past history.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Still, even with such built-in limitations, 
	evolution has led to an amazing diversity of form and function throughout 
	the plant and animal world. Consider all the different shapes and colors of 
	flowers. Why isn't there just one single shape for all flowers? Why isn't 
	there just one single color? Why so much diversity? The answer has to do, at 
	least in part, with the historical process of <i>co-evolution </i>between 
	different species. Take the case of plants and pollinators for instance. 
	Some plants don't make any real noticeable flowers and reproduce just by 
	releasing pollen (plant sperm cells) into the wind, where it then drifts 
	along and sometimes happens to land on female plant ovaries to end up 
	producing a new seed. But in many species of plants, evolution has developed 
	a mechanism that ensures that successful pollination is less left up to 
	chance: the plant produces showy flowers, which may also have a distinct 
	scent, and which contain not only plant reproductive organs but also an 
	additional pot of honey (plant nectar). The showy flower petals and the 
	sweet nectar are of no direct &quot;use&quot; to the plants themselves, but they 
	attract animal <i>pollinators </i>--members of animal species who come to 
	recognize the flower and to remember that it is in effect a &quot;flag&quot; 
	advertising a source of food--the nectar. Pollinator species include many 
	species of flying insects (such as honeybees), some species of birds (such 
	as hummingbirds) and even a few species of bats and monkeys. In all cases 
	the story is basically the same: the pollinators come to the flower to suck 
	up the sweet nectar, and in doing so they accidentally pick up pollen (plant 
	sperm cells) on their bodies at the same time. Then, acting as much more 
	consistent and reliable pollinators than the wind, they move on to another 
	flower of the same plant species to get some more nectar; that's when the 
	pollen from the first flower gets rubbed off their bodies and enters into 
	the second flower's ovaries, where it will serve to produce new seeds. The 
	plant species has basically evolved a way to &quot;use&quot; the animal species to 
	ensure its own more successful reproduction, while the animal species has 
	co-evolved a way to ensure itself a reliable source of food. <i>Both </i>
	species benefit from this symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship, 
	though of course neither the pollinator nor the pollinated is in any way 
	conscious of this process.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">What we are seeing is simply the result of a process 
	of natural selection, taking place over many generations and considerable 
	periods of time. These particular processes obviously did not take place in 
	all evolutionary lineages (there are still many plant species that are 
	pollinated simply by the wind, and there are many animal species which do 
	not serve as plant pollinators) and, in any case, evolution was not &quot;bound&quot; 
	to unfold in those <i>particular </i>directions. But among at least some of 
	the ancestors of modern-day pollinators, individuals who went to flowers to 
	get nectar must have reproduced more than those that didn't; so, as long as 
	the ability to detect and exploit such a fine food resource was inheritable, 
	it would have spread to more and more descendants. And among some of the 
	ancestors of today's plants, individuals which happened to produce flowers 
	with a pot of nectar and a showy form of advertisement (bright colors, sweet 
	smells, etc.) which increased the odds of successful pollination must have 
	had a distinct reproductive advantage over those that didn't have these 
	features. Through simple natural selection, those features would have spread 
	to more and more descendants as well.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This completely unconscious process (which requires 
	no outside &quot;designer&quot; whatsoever) can be observed over and over in nature. 
	And even though we can't usually be present to see a new species come into 
	being (many of the plants and animals we observe today are the products of
	<i>millions </i>of years of past evolution and adaptation to changing 
	environments), we can conduct experiments to manipulate (transform) nature 
	and actually observe--and even <i>measure </i>--whether or not (and to what 
	extent) certain features of an organism, which we suspect might provide them 
	with a reproductive &quot;edge,&quot; actually <i>do </i>provide that advantage.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Here's just one of thousands of examples of such 
	experiments: Quite a few plant species, especially in the tropics, produce 
	little <i>nectar pots </i>on their leaves or stems which seem of no direct 
	use to the plant itself (and which are energetically &quot;expensive&quot; for a plant 
	to produce) but which <i>attract ants </i>which crawl all over the plants, 
	visiting the little nectar pots and sucking up this rich food source. The 
	advantage to the ant species is obvious (a reliable source of food), but is 
	there really an advantage to the plant species? Field experiments have shown 
	that, if you prevent ants from getting to plants of these species, the 
	plants will tend to get devoured by leaf-eating insects. But when ants are 
	continually &quot;patrolling&quot; up and down the leaves and stems of the so-called 
	&quot;ant- plants,&quot; the leaf-eating insects are largely driven away, and the 
	plants stay much healthier and are better able to grow and produce seeds. So 
	the evolution by natural selection of this <i>unconscious co- relationship
	</i>between ants and plants has given populations of <i>both </i>a 
	measurable &quot;reproductive edge&quot;; and the proof is there for all to see.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Going back to our pollinator example: the co-evolved 
	adaptations of plant species and their pollinator species is often so 
	&quot;tight&quot; that biologists can tell what kind of pollinator will visit a plant 
	species just by checking out the shape, color, and smell of the flowers: for 
	instance, red flowers with a long, thin, tube-like shape are pollinated by 
	hummingbirds, which are attracted to red and suck out nectar with long thin 
	beaks; brightly colored flowers with flatter parts and sweet smells are 
	usually pollinated by bees and similar insects which are able to detect both 
	the colors and the scents of these flowers. Colorless white flowers with 
	strong sweetish smells are usually pollinated at night (when colors are 
	irrelevant) by night-flying animals like moths or bats. And then there are 
	those thankfully rare species of plants which produce rather colorless 
	flowers with a horrible &quot;rotten meat&quot; smell--those are the ones that are 
	pollinated by some species of flies!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Much of evolutionary change by natural selection 
	seems objectively &quot;driven,&quot; in a sense, by the simple fact that the natural 
	world is not one of infinite resources and that living organisms must 
	objectively compete in one way or another for these limited resources. Both
	<i>intra-specific competition </i>(competition between individuals of the 
	same species) and <i>inter-specific competition </i>(competition between 
	individuals of different species) contributes to evolutionary change by 
	natural selection. For instance, individuals of the same species often 
	compete with each other for such finite (limited) resources as food, water, 
	mates, territories, nesting sites, pollinators, and so on. Individuals who 
	happen to have genetically transmittable features which make them relatively 
	more successful than others at obtaining such limited resources, will likely 
	&quot;do better&quot; at surviving and reproducing than individuals who don't have 
	these features. Unless some other factors intervene to channel overall 
	evolutionary changes in some other directions (or even lead to a species' 
	extinction), those features will then tend to spread over the generations by 
	natural selection and may come to characterize a whole population or even a 
	whole species.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Individuals belonging to <i>different species </i>
	but occupying the <i>same habitat </i>may also objectively compete with each 
	other for finite resources, such as food or water (for example, when members 
	of different plant species compete for energy-producing sunlight in the 
	understory layer of a forest). In addition, members of many different 
	species may also interact with each other as potential predators or 
	potential prey. In fact, the great variety of <i>predator-prey interactions
	</i>which take place between members of different species has likely played 
	a very important role in objectively &quot;driving&quot; (or channeling) a great deal 
	of evolutionary change by natural selection (including species 
	diversification) throughout the history of life. <i>Evolutionary 
	modifications that make predators more efficient at capturing prey, or prey 
	more efficient at avoiding predators, often represent some of the most 
	clear-cut adaptations of organisms to their changing environments.</i><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 2" href="#Footnote text 2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Evolutionary ecologists and population geneticists 
	working together have provided a great deal of evidence of evolution in 
	action in whole ecosystems--recording evidence of the ways different 
	populations use limited resources, the effects of intra-specific and 
	inter-specific competition and predator-prey interactions, the direction of 
	evolutionary changes taking place in different populations in response to 
	changes in physical or biotic environments (droughts; floods; increases or 
	decreases in competitor or prey species), and so on. All these kinds of 
	things can be assessed experimentally and the effects of various variables 
	on what scientists call &quot;reproductive fitness&quot; can actually be measured. 
	Evolutionary changes observed to be taking place at the level of populations 
	can also be correlated with (linked to) changes in underlying genetic 
	variation at the molecular level: for instance certain DNA alleles can be 
	shown to have increased or decreased in frequency in a given population in 
	line with certain observable changes in the appearance and/or mode of 
	existence of that population, and all this can in turn be compared to what 
	is going on in a different population of the same species which may be 
	interacting with a somewhat different set of environmental factors.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is important to remember also that evolutionary 
	change doesn't happen in a pre-set direction. In fact, the direction of a 
	local evolutionary change can actually get <i>reversed </i>in a population 
	if some feature which gave individuals a reproductive advantage in one 
	situation is no longer an advantage in a changed environment: for instance, 
	in a hot dry desert, adaptations which help to conserve water (like the 
	needles of cactus plants) are very common, but species with such specialized 
	adaptations would likely evolve new features (or alternatively go extinct) 
	if large-scale climate changes transformed the desert into a lush tropical 
	wetland. Again, evolutionary change happens over time in relation to local 
	environments <i>which are themselves always changing </i>--so there is no 
	one direction, no single track to &quot;progress,&quot; no pre-set purpose and no 
	final end-point.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">There are, however, so many spectacular examples of 
	&quot;finely tuned&quot; adaptations between organisms and their particular 
	environments (including other species) that it is not surprising that many 
	people think these wonders must have been produced by some all-knowing 
	&quot;designer&quot; (god). But, actually, when you look into the matter further and 
	with a scientific approach, you learn that all the wonders of nature and all 
	its diversity can in fact be produced through modifications of pre-existing 
	living material, through step-wise processes spread out over long enough 
	periods of time. And, as we will discuss a bit later in this series , you 
	also find out that evolution is far from a &quot;perfecting&quot; or &quot;optimizing&quot; 
	mechanism: there is plenty of evidence of things which are evolutionary 
	quirks, vestigial features (no longer needed &quot;carry-overs&quot; from distant 
	ancestors), wasteful tidbits, and even detrimental &quot;imperfections&quot;--all of 
	which would make absolutely <u>no sense </u>if an all-powerful and 
	all-knowing god had &quot;designed&quot; nature. These things do make sense, however, 
	if all life evolved from a common ancestor and then diversified through 
	natural selection and related mechanisms into countless different forms--but 
	only on the basis of whatever raw material (genetic variability) one 
	generation inherits from the immediately preceding one. This raw material is 
	constrained (channeled and restricted) by past historical development, and 
	is therefore not capable of producing limitless or &quot;ideal&quot; modifications.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In a later installment of this series, we will 
	discuss more fully why the actual evidence of evolution disproves the idea 
	of a supreme &quot;intelligent designer.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">======================</font></p>
	<p><b><font face="Verdana">FOOTNOTES:</font></b></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">
	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote text 1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we 
	mentioned earlier in this series, there are processes other than natural 
	selection which can contribute to the evolution of populations of organisms, 
	including accidental genetic drift, founder effects and neutral mutations. 
	All these can contribute to a population evolving merely by causing shifts 
	in the relative frequencies of certain genes from one generation to the 
	next. These sorts of shifts in gene frequency are not the result of natural 
	selection. Natural selection is, however, responsible for that fine-tuning 
	process we call adaptation. At the same time, it is important to keep in 
	mind that you can't just look at a feature of an organism and <i>assume </i>
	it represents an adaptation. Many features of organisms are not adaptive, 
	and some of them may just be the result of developmental constraints 
	(limits) or simple by-products attached to the development of another 
	feature which may itself be adaptive and the result of natural selection.</a></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#Footnote1">
	[Return to article]</a></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">
	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote text 2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
	important to remember once again that adaptations are not the only kind of 
	evolutionary change. For instance, a population might evolve significant 
	differences relative to the ancestral population from which it is descended 
	when a small number of individuals find themselves cut off from the larger 
	population when they migrate into some isolated geographic pocket such as an 
	island, a hidden valley, the other side of a ridge or some other barrier. 
	Such a small sub-population in its more isolated pocket just doesn't have as 
	much genetic variation in its total gene pool as the larger population it 
	came from. This can make for a loss of some of the raw material evolution 
	can work with (relative &quot;genetic impoverishment&quot;), but it can also create 
	conditions for the emergence of evolutionary &quot;novelties&quot; which may be more 
	likely to emerge accidentally in smaller populations. Phenomena such as 
	genetic drift and founder effects are important supplements to standard 
	Darwinian natural selection in contributing to evolutionary change.</a></font></p>
