	<h3><font face="Verdana">Part 4a: How Evolution Produces Whole New Species</font></h3>
  <p><font face="Verdana">The diversity of life-forms on this planet is 
  practically mind-boggling: species of plants and animals previously unknown to 
  science are still being discovered (especially in the canopy of rain forest 
  trees and in the deepest layers of the oceans), and rough estimates place the 
  total number of species on earth as somewhere in the order of 10 million! And 
  that's just the <i>living </i>species: the vast majority of the species which 
  lived in earlier geological eras are now extinct. In fact, it appears that 
  more than 90% of all the species that ever lived on this planet are no longer 
  with us.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">But why have there been <i>so many </i>different kinds 
  of species in the past history of this planet? And why are there <i>so many
  </i>different species of plants, animals, bacteria and fungi inhabiting the 
  earth today? In other words, why is life so<i> diversified </i>? The basic 
  answer to these questions is that the increasing <i>diversification </i>of 
  life is a simple by-product of the <i>evolution </i>of life. The fact that 
  life on this planet is so diverse has nothing to do with any kind of god or 
  other supernatural force; it is not necessary to imagine some kind of 
  out-of-control or perpetually dissatisfied Creator who just can't seem to stop 
  &quot;designing&quot; more and more new creatures even though this planet already holds 
  something like 10,000 different species of birds and at least 27,000 different 
  species of fish, for instance! We don't need to invoke such silliness, because 
  the science of evolution provides a much more sensible explanation for why 
  there is so much diversity. There is plenty of both direct and indirect 
  evidence that all this diversity is due to some fairly straightforward natural 
  phenomena, taking place over very long periods of time.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">As we will be discussing in this installment, the 
  diversity of species on this planet has everything to do with the fact that: 
  1) all populations of living things are constantly evolving (accumulating 
  inheritable changes and modifications over the generations); 2) all 
  populations are constantly evolving in interaction with the local environments 
  they occupy, which are themselves always changing and presenting species with 
  new evolutionary pressures and &quot;challenges&quot;; and 3) every now and then the 
  quantity or quality of evolutionary modifications which have accumulated over 
  generations in one single population of a more wide-ranging species are <i>
  significant enough </i>(in terms of resulting in sufficiently important 
  changes in the anatomy, development, or behaviors which characterize the 
  individuals of that population) that this population &quot;splinters off&quot; 
  (&quot;splits,&quot; &quot;diverges,&quot; &quot;buds off&quot;) from the rest of its &quot;parent&quot; species and 
  actually becomes a brand new separate species. And since evolutionary change 
  never stops happening, this new species is likely at some point to splinter 
  off <i>yet again </i>into one or more even more different &quot;daughter&quot; species 
  of its own.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">This same basic process has been repeating itself over 
  and over again for hundreds of millions of years, with new features appearing 
  at each juncture where a new species evolves. And the longer this process goes 
  on, the more the descendant species will become different from their more 
  remote ancestors, even while they retain some of the features of those 
  ancestors.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">As we discussed in previous installments of this 
  series, there is absolutely no doubt that <i>all the different species of life 
  on earth originated as evolutionary modifications of pre-existing ancestor 
  species.</i>This means that all living species are related to each other, 
  through a succession of shared ancestors, going all the way back to those very 
  first primitive life-forms which emerged out of earth's chemical &quot;soup&quot; some 
  three and a half billion years ago. And this means that our own human species 
  is related, by different degrees of kinship, <i>to all other species on the 
  planet </i>, including the pigeon on the sidewalk, the maple tree in the park, 
  or the neighborhood dog--we are <i>all </i>the product of a long process of 
  accumulating evolutionary modifications from common ancestor species, though 
  obviously evolution caused life to diversify in <i>many </i>different 
  directions and along <i>many </i>different pathways at different junctures in 
  the three and a half billion years of our collective history!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">As we will discuss more in another installment of this 
  series, tracing our own human ancestry would be like going back in a 
  time-machine. It would be like following a line back through many major 
  evolutionary splits and junctures, through a succession of many different 
  kinds of ancestors, who were also the shared ancestors of whole other 
  evolutionary lines. First, we would go back in time through a series of 
  different hominid (human-like) ancestors, who diverged more and more from our 
  more ape-like ancestors of 4 to 10 million years ago, thanks to the evolution 
  of upright-walking, increasingly large brains and the capacity for advanced 
  language and social coordination. Our close cousins the modern chimpanzees and 
  gorillas evolved out of the same ancient ancestor species, but followed 
  significantly different evolutionary paths.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Going back further still, through <i>many </i>more 
  evolutionary splits and junctures and a great many different species, we would 
  trace our ancestry back to the very first <i>mammals </i>(warm-blooded animals 
  that evolved the capacity to give birth to live young nurtured with milk from 
  mammary glands). Keep going back further still through our &quot;family album&quot; and 
  you eventually get back to the very first <i>reptiles </i>(whose tougher skin 
  and amniotic eggs kept them from drying out away from water and allowed them 
  to colonize land without having to periodically return to water like their 
  amphibian ancestors). Follow things back to the first amphibians (ancestors of 
  modern frogs, toads and salamanders) who evolved out of more fish-like 
  ancestors, and had the capacity, for the first time in the history of life on 
  earth, to crawl out of the water on stumpy legs and breathe air into lungs. 
  Keep going back in time, through the ancestors of the first bony fishes, to 
  the very first marine vertebrates (the first animals to evolve a backbone), 
  and back further still to the first <i>marine invertebrates </i>(which lacked 
  a backbone but had evolved the first complex multicellular bodies), and 
  eventually you'll arrive all the way back to our very oldest ancestors, the <i>
  bacteria-like </i>creatures which were the first to evolve the capacity to 
  surround little packets of DNA molecules with some kind of cell wall or 
  membrane and which had themselves evolved out of some self-assembling protein 
  strands present in earth's early &quot;chemical soup.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Keep in mind that the human species is not some kind 
  of ultimate end-point or uppermost culmination of the whole three and a half 
  billion years of life's evolution. We do have many very special qualities 
  which distinguish us from all other species, including our unprecedented 
  capacity to consciously transform our external world and to transmit 
  accumulated knowledge through non-genetic cultural evolution. But there are 
  other evolutionary lines which have been successful at maintaining themselves 
  over hundreds of millions of years, such as the bacteria, which are 
  quantitatively the best represented organisms on the planet! As for the many 
  evolutionary lines which went off in completely different directions, it is 
  clear that there are many which ultimately resulted in evolutionary dead-ends, 
  but there are also many others which <i>continued </i>to repeatedly branch off 
  into a succession of successful life-forms, many of which persist on our 
  planet today.</font></p>

  <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Box 1 return from">So the human species 
  is just one of the millions of current-day species that happens to sit at the 
  current tip of one of the &quot;twigs&quot; of the branching bush of life</a>. The many 
  other evolutionary branches and twigs resulted in the many other modern-day 
  species. For instance, in addition to the 27,000 different species of fish and 
  the 10,000 different species of birds, there are 4,000 different species of 
  amphibians, more than 7,000 different species of reptiles, and close to 5,000 
  different species of mammals. And there are also millions of additional living 
  species, including among the flowering and non-flowering plants, the bacteria 
  and other microorganisms, the shellfish, the insects, etc. In fact the largest 
  single group of animals on earth today are the <i>beetles </i>(the sub-group 
  of the insects which includes such familiar species as cockroaches and 
  ladybugs): there are about half a million different species of beetles on the 
  planet today!<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#Footnote 1 text" name="Footnote 1">1</a></sup></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Verdana">How Do We Know Something Really Happened<br>
  If We Weren't There To See It?</p>
  </font></b>
  <p><font face="Verdana">As we will review further in a later installment of 
  this series, there are actually <i>many </i>different &quot;categories of evidence&quot; 
  which combine to confirm the basic picture of how life has evolved on this 
  planet. This includes evidence from the fossil record (which shows a series of 
  successive changes in plant or animal lines spread out over millions of years) 
  and evidence from molecular biology (which backs up the fossil record and 
  which reveals the degree to which different evolutionary lines are more 
  closely or distantly related according to the degrees of similarity or 
  difference of their DNA). Such <i>mutually reinforcing categories of evidence
  </i>are reinforced further still by evidence stemming from developmental 
  biology and embryology, and even from the patterns of distribution of species 
  around the globe<b>.</b> All these different kinds of evidence, taken 
  together, leave absolutely zero doubt that <i>all </i>living species on this 
  planet are <i>related </i>to each other and are the products of <i>descent 
  with modification </i>from a series of<i> common ancestors </i>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">The Creationists often like to complain that &quot;nobody 
  was around&quot; to &quot;see&quot; evolution taking place over hundreds of millions of 
  years, so it's just an unproven story. But the fact that we weren't around to 
  witness past events doesn't mean they didn't take place, and it doesn't mean 
  we don't have ways of figuring out what happened. Think about it: 
  evolutionists figure out how life-forms repeatedly changed and diversified 
  over time; astronomers and cosmologists figure out how galaxies and solar 
  systems came into being billions of years ago and how they too change over 
  time; historians and anthropologists figure out how humans organized their 
  societies thousands or tens of thousands of years ago; molecular scientists 
  and particle physicists figure out the characteristics of chemical bonds and 
  the interactions of sub- atomic particles they cannot directly &quot;see&quot;; 
  linguists figure out how current human languages evolved through a series of 
  step-wise cultural modifications of much older languages which were spoken by 
  people who have long ceased to exist. We weren't there to directly &quot;see&quot; <i>
  any </i>of these changes happening, but we do have techniques which we can use 
  to figure out a lot of what happened in the past.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">In all these so-called &quot;historical sciences,&quot; there 
  are <i>scientific methods </i>which make it possible for us to uncover the 
  left-over marks of the past--those things which &quot;carry over&quot; through time and 
  which are still present in modern-day systems and entities. Things such as the 
  anatomical similarities of body structures which link a modern species to an 
  ancient fossil ancestor, or things such as the similarities in grammar and 
  vocabulary of the French, Spanish and Italian languages which mark them as 
  closely related to each other and all derived from their ancient Latin 
  ancestor language. <i>All </i>the historical sciences contribute to building 
  up human knowledge through investigations of such historical ties and through 
  the process of historical inference, deducing from the actual concrete 
  evidence comprehensive theories which have the power to consistently explain a 
  number of different related processes and phenomena. Historical scientists 
  come to achieve great confidence in their theories (and widespread consensus, 
  as is the case with the theory of evolution) whenever they detect clear 
  patterns of <i>consilience of evidence </i>(which simply means that lots of 
  different streams of evidence, coming from many different directions, all 
  point to the <i>same </i>conclusions and reinforce our understanding of 
  something, such as when the molecular evidence and the evidence from the 
  fossil record both agree on when two evolutionary lines diverged in the past).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Furthermore, in the historical sciences (including the 
  science of evolution) scientific methods are used to make <i>predictions </i>
  which can then be <i>tested:</i>predictions <i>both </i>about what we <i>
  should </i>be able to find, and also predictions about what we <i>should not
  </i>be able to find, if a particular theory about the past is true. And 
  scientists do actually go out and test these predictions in the real world. As 
  just one example, we can predict that if the theory of evolution is true, we
  <i>should </i>be able to find step-wise progressions of certain anatomical 
  modifications in series of fossils arranged by age (and we do find this); and 
  we can also predict that if the theory of evolution is true we <i>should not
  </i>be able to find something like a human fossil embedded in a rock layer 
  containing dinosaurs, since everything we understand about how evolution works 
  tells us that humans evolved long after the dinosaurs had become extinct (and 
  in fact fossils of dinosaurs and of human ancestors are never found in the 
  same rock layers). So, unlike &quot;religious beliefs,&quot; scientific predictions 
  (including predictions made about the processes involved in evolution) are 
  actually <i>testable and verifiable.</i>This, probably more than anything 
  else, is why there is such a strong consensus among scientists the world over 
  concerning the basic facts and principles of evolution.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Like any good scientific theory, the theory of 
  evolution is &quot;falsifiable&quot;--which simply means that it is possible to conceive 
  of any number of different ways it could be proven to be false (and therefore 
  rejected and discarded) if certain kinds of evidence (evidence fundamentally 
  incompatible with the theory) were ever found. Any scientist will tell you 
  that it is easy to make a list of things which, <i>if they were ever found </i>
  --whether in the fossil record, in the DNA of organisms, in the anatomy and 
  patterns of development of living plants and animals, or even in the patterns 
  of distribution of species on earth--would leave scientists no choice but to 
  reject the theory of evolution as false. But in the 140 years since Darwin 
  first proposed the basic theory of evolution, there have been innumerable 
  scientific studies and experiments which have <i>supported </i>the theory of 
  evolution, but there has never been a single shred of concrete evidence, in 
  any field, which could cause scientists to doubt or call into question the 
  basic facts and fundamental principles of evolution. Not one. No wonder so 
  many scientists consider that the evolution is one of the &quot;very best supported 
  theories in all of science!&quot;</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <b><font face="Verdana">
  <p>Speciation and the Diversification of Life Are Rooted in the Same Basic 
  Phenomena, Including Natural Selection</p>
  </font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>
  <p><font face="Verdana">The science of evolution has allowed us to understand 
  that the process of speciation (or how brand new species evolve out of 
  pre-existing ancestor species) is very interconnected with the question of why 
  there ended up being so many different kinds of species on this planet. In 
  fact (as we will see), understanding <i>speciation </i>is key to understanding
  <i>diversification:</i>understanding how and why new &quot;daughter&quot; species can 
  emerge out of a &quot;parent&quot; species (speciation) also allows us to better 
  understand what &quot;drove&quot; life-forms to further subdivide (frequently and 
  repeatedly!) into so many different plant and animal species. The science of 
  evolution can answer, for instance, such intriguing questions as why, since 
  bacteria have proven so successful at maintaining themselves on this planet, 
  life didn't simply &quot;stick&quot; with bacteria.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <b><font face="Verdana">
  <p>Living Things Can't Help But Evolve</p>
  </font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>
  <p><font face="Verdana">First of all, it is important to remember that very 
  crucial &quot;fact of life&quot; we discussed in previous installments of this 
  series--that a fundamental characteristic of <i>all </i>living populations of 
  organisms is that <i>they continually evolve </i>(change). They do so 
  automatically, as part and parcel of the basic process of 
  living--unconsciously, and without any supernatural force or direction needing 
  to be involved in any way. In previous installments we gave a number of 
  examples of how we can actually directly <i>observe </i>evolutionary change 
  taking place over a number of generations in living populations of plants and 
  animals, both in the lab and in the wild. We saw that all that is needed for 
  evolutionary change to take place is for the following ingredients to be 
  present: a reproducing <i>population </i>(reproductive community) made up of a 
  collection of <i>varied individuals;</i>and a mechanism (<i> such as 
  inheritance of DNA-based genetic variation </i>) for at least some of that 
  individual variation to be <i>transmitted </i>(passed on) to <i>succeeding 
  generations </i>(descendants). Anytime you have those ingredients, evolution 
  will automatically take place--because at each successive generation, those 
  individuals in a given local environment which have inherited from their 
  parents certain features which happen to give them a reproductive &quot;edge&quot; 
  (relative to individuals who <i>don't </i>have those features) will on average 
  be able to contribute more descendants to the next generation, who will in 
  turn contribute more descendants to the next generation, and so on and so 
  forth. In this way, those particular features will tend to <i>spread </i>
  throughout a whole population. This is what it means to say that a population 
  has undergone evolutionary change.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">This is evolution &quot;by natural selection&quot; and, as we 
  discussed previously, it happens all around us, all the time. Keep in mind 
  that evolutionary change does not happen in individuals, and it never happens 
  &quot;instantly&quot;: it only happens in <i>populations </i>(made up of lots of varied 
  individuals), and it only happens over <i>many </i>successive <i>generations.
  </i>The fact that natural populations evolve by natural selection is an 
  extremely well-documented fact in science (see examples in previous 
  installments of this series, and see the accompanying box on the evolution of 
  pesticide resistance in insects for yet another example of how we can tell 
  that living populations are always evolving).</font></p>
  <p><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="pesticide_resistence.htm">
  <font face="Verdana">[</font><font face="Verdana"><b>See &quot;Evolution of 
  Pesticide Resistance in a Population of Insects&quot;]</b></font></a></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">
  <a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Box 2 return from">By now, scientists 
  have collected so much concrete evidence of evolution that most people who are 
  at all familiar with basic scientific understanding and principles accept as
  <i>proven fact </i>the kind of evolution by natural selection that can be 
  commonly seen to be taking place among populations of any living plant or 
  animal species. </a>In fact, the evidence is so strong that even the Catholic 
  Pope recently recognized evolution to be true. And even some of the so-called 
  &quot;scientific Creationists&quot; aligned with Christian fundamentalism (who are 
  definitely religious but not at all scientific!) have at times been willing to 
  recognize that relatively minor evolutionary changes can take place <i>within
  </i>species. But they still argue that everyone should just accept on what 
  amounts to blind faith that--at least &quot;in the beginning&quot;--god created all the 
  initial different &quot;kinds&quot; of plants and animals <i>separately,</i>because that 
  is what it says in the Bible. They argue that god probably just decided to 
  &quot;allow&quot; evolution to take place &quot;within&quot; these separately created &quot;kinds&quot; <i>
  after </i>the initial act of Creation. Of course, the Bible makes no mention 
  whatsoever of evolution of any kind, since evolution was not something people 
  knew anything about at the time the Bible was written by human authors. But 
  what is happening is that at least some modern-day followers of the Bible are 
  somewhat desperately trying to find some way of reconciling their religious 
  beliefs with the rather obvious and undeniable advances in scientific 
  knowledge which have occurred since the time when the Bible was written.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">Meanwhile, the craziest of the Creationists and 
  &quot;literalist&quot; interpreters of the Bible (as &quot;the Word of God&quot;) refuse to budge 
  even one inch on the question, carrying signs that claim evolutionists will 
  all burn in hell, trying to get laws passed to force adherence to the Bible 
  and the teaching of religious Creationism in the public schools, and trying, 
  not so unsuccessfully, to weasel their way into positions of power and 
  influence, from local school boards to presidential dining rooms.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">One thing all the different types of Creationists 
  refuse to recognize is the simple fact that there is plenty of concrete 
  scientific evidence that proves not only that evolution is constantly going on
  <i>within </i>living populations of plants and animals, but also that brand 
  new species of plants and animals really do come into being, not out of thin 
  air or through divine intervention, but<i> as derived evolutionary 
  modifications of previously existing ancestor species </i>. All the evidence 
  points to the fact that there are not now, nor have there ever been, any 
  &quot;separately created kinds.&quot;<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#Footnote 2 text" name="Footnote 2">2</a></sup>

  <p><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, there continue to be a lot of 
  misconceptions about what it means that a new species emerges out of a 
  preceding ancestor species.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">For the purposes of this installment, it may be 
  helpful to remember that the term <i>microevolution </i>generally refers to 
  evolutionary changes taking place<i> within populations and species </i>, and 
  the term <i>macroevolution </i>refers to the major evolutionary trends which 
  have marked higher order splits and junctures <i>at or above the species level
  </i>and taking place over the whole long history of evolution on earth. The 
  phenomenon of <i>speciation </i>(the emergence of a new species out of an 
  ancestor species) is the focus of this installment, because it is in a sense 
  the key &quot;bridge&quot; linking the kind of evolutionary changes which we can observe 
  happening all the time <i>within </i>populations <i>and </i>the kind of 
  qualitative splits and ruptures which mark the start of<i> a whole new 
  evolutionary line </i>, such as a new <b>Family </b>or<b> Order </b>, and 
  which <i>begin </i>with particular speciation events, or with rapid &quot;bursts&quot; 
  of such events.</font><sup><font face="Verdana"><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#Footnote 3 text" name="Footnote 3">3</a></font></p>
  </sup>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><i>Speciation events </i>(the birth of new species) 
  sometimes takes place against a backdrop of <i>species extinctions </i>(the 
  death of old species), since these are also part of the ongoing process of 
  evolutionary change, including on the larger (macroevolutionary) scales. In 
  short, understanding <i>both </i>how new species come to be and how and why 
  species may go extinct is crucial to understanding the history of the 
  evolution of life on earth as it has actually unfolded over billions of years, 
  and as it continues to unfold even today.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana"><i>It is also important to realize that there is not 
  some big artificial wall separating micro- evolutionary change from 
  macro-evolutionary change.</i> Macro-evolutionary change has some additional 
  features and characteristics which pertain to larger-scale &quot;trends&quot; (our 
  knowledge of which keeps expanding) but it <i>encompasses (and is rooted in)</i>all 
  the well-known mechanisms of micro- evolutionary change, <i>including natural 
  selection.</i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">All this should become clearer as we go along. But 
  first, let's get rid of some basic confusion: the emergence of a new species 
  does <i>not </i>mean that a cat can turn into a dog, or that a fish can turn 
  into a parrot; it does not mean that you can hold a lizard in your hands and 
  see it turn into a bird; and, even though humans and the modern great apes 
  (chimpanzees and gorillas) really <i>are </i>close cousins by evolutionary 
  standards (and we even share more than 99% of our DNA!), that doesn't mean 
  that one day long ago some kind of chimpanzee gave birth to a human baby. This 
  is <i>not </i>how evolution works!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">This is why I put so much stress on making sure we all 
  keep in mind that, while individuals reproduce, it is whole <i>populations </i>
  that evolve, and also that they can only do so, step-wise, over<i> many </i>, 
  many generations. Major evolutionary change is never &quot;instantaneous.&quot; </font>

  <p>How Do Entirely New Species Come Into Being?</p>
  </font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>
  <p><font face="Verdana">To understand how a new species can emerge out of an 
  ancestor species, you first have to really understand what a species is. In 
  modern biology, a <i>species </i>of animal or plant is usually defined as a 
  collection of populations which <i>can successfully interbreed </i>(mate with 
  each other) and <i>produce viable fertile offspring </i>(young which will be 
  able to survive and in turn reproduce). To qualify as a species, a group of 
  organisms has to be &quot;reproductively isolated&quot; from all other species. As we 
  will see, there are many different &quot;isolating mechanisms&quot; which can lead 
  different populations of even closely related organisms to become 
  &quot;reproductively incompatible&quot; with each other, even if they live in the same 
  geographic area and even if they sometimes still &quot;look&quot; (to our eyes at least) 
  almost the same. Two closely related species of frogs, for instance, might 
  look almost alike and live in the same area but still be reproductively 
  incompatible simply because they have evolved different mating calls and so 
  don't even recognize each other as potential mates. &quot;Reproductive 
  compatibility&quot; (or the capacity for successful interbreeding) is what ends up 
  grouping populations of organisms together into one single species, and it is 
  also what ultimately separates one species from another.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">In the real world, populations of living organisms 
  belonging to the same species often <i>vary </i>slightly, relative to each 
  other, across a range of geographic distribution. For instance, some species 
  of birds are made up of different populations with slightly different color 
  patterns in the Eastern and Western United States; and populations in the 
  Mid-West, where the Eastern and Western varieties overlap and hybridize 
  (&quot;cross-breed&quot; with each other), are often intermediate in appearance. Despite 
  these superficial differences, the different populations of such a bird 
  species are still part of one single species, because they have not lost the 
  ability to interbreed and produce viable and fertile offspring. In such cases, 
  the different populations are simply considered different &quot;geographic races&quot; 
  or &quot;subspecies&quot; (as opposed to different species).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">This, of course, is also why biologists understand 
  that all human beings all around the world are all part of <i>a single </i>
  species. We may have minor superficial differences in things like skin color 
  or hair types, but we have no consistent and fundamental differences, we all 
  share a common gene pool, and we are all perfectly capable of successfully 
  interbreeding with each other. Racist theories of racial superior<font size="3">ity 
  or inferiority, which confuse some people into thinking that different human 
  &quot;races&quot; are somehow different &quot;kinds,&quot; have absolutely <i>no </i>basis in 
  scientific fact! We are truly one single intermingling species, spread 
  throughout the globe.</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Organisms can only be said to belong to <i>
  different </i>species <i>if they are sufficiently reproductively isolated from 
  each other and would therefore no longer be capable of successfully 
  interbreeding even if they shared the same locality.</i></font><sup><font size="3" face="Verdana"><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="#Footnote 4 text" name="Footnote 4">4</a></font><i></p>
  </i></sup>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Understanding some of the many ways in which 
  one population of organisms can become reproductively isolated from its parent 
  population is key to understanding how a brand new species can come into 
  being. This is because speciation often occurs when a population which has 
  become reproductively isolated from its parent population ends up accumulating 
  enough genetic differences (through the sorting out processes of natural 
  selection and related phenomena) that it loses its ability to interbreed with 
  the original parent population.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Once reproductive isolation has been 
  maintained for a long enough period of time (numbers of generations) and full 
  speciation has occurred, the populations of the two now different species will 
  both continue to evolve in the usual ways, including by natural selection and 
  in interaction with their particular environments. But now they will do so <i>
  separately</i> (on the basis of separate and somewhat different gene pools), 
  and for this reason they will accumulate ever greater differences over time, 
  pulling them further and further apart. At every generation, both in the 
  original parent species and in the new daughter species, the usual random 
  processes of mutation and genetic recombinations will re-shuffle the (now 
  somewhat different) genetic deck of cards, and this will bring forward some 
  individuals with new features which may or may not prove reproductively 
  advantageous in a particular environment, but which in any case won't be 
  exactly the same in the two species since they are no longer mixing their gene 
  pools at each generation. This, combined with the fact that even slight 
  differences in the environments they occupy can also exert somewhat different 
  selective pressures on populations of the old and the new species (for 
  example, &quot;favoring&quot; the development of short and stout bird beaks where tough 
  hard seeds are available, or of thinner, tube-like beaks in environments where 
  nectar-filled flowers offer a good alternative food source) will tend to make 
  the populations of the old and new species grow further and further apart 
  (becoming more and more different in such things as anatomy, development, or 
  behaviors) the more time goes on.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">In addition, a parent species may end up 
  &quot;budding off&quot; some &quot;daughter species&quot; more than once in the course of its 
  history (though perhaps at different times and in relation to different 
  sub-environments), and many of these daughter species are also likely to, in 
  turn, &quot;bud off&quot; additional (and even more different!) daughter species of 
  their own. All of this contributes to pulling entire ancestor and descendant 
  lineages (lines) further and further apart over time. That's why life is so 
  diversified!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">A species which has relatively <i>recently</i> 
  &quot;budded off&quot; from its parent species is likely to be recognizable as a 
  &quot;closely related&quot; species for some time. But if the speciation process keeps 
  getting repeated over and over again, and over many millions of years , the 
  shared ancestry of different organisms may well become less immediately 
  obvious. For instance, you would not automatically think that modern-day 
  whales are descended from a four-legged mammal ancestor that walked on land, 
  but in fact we now know whales are descended from just such a creature! We can 
  see this because people have uncovered a whole series of fossils of 
  intermediate species (as well as some additional molecular DNA evidence) which 
  reveal the seemingly odd family connection between an original land-based 
  ancestor and the modern whales.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">There is actually a region of the dry Sahara 
  desert of northern Africa (which used to be covered by an ocean millions of 
  years ago) which today is known as the &quot;Valley of the Whales&quot; because its 
  sands contain an incredible number of well-preserved fossilized skeletons of a 
  whale species which swam in the area 40 million years ago. This whale species 
  has some features which are similar to those of modern whales, but it also has 
  vestigial (remnant) toes, legs, and pelvis ! These features link it (through a 
  number of other intermediate steps) to a land-based mammal which lived in the 
  area some 10 million years earlier. And it would take another 15 million years 
  or so (and many more instances of daughter species budding off from parent 
  species) for those remaining leg and toe bones to end up fully converted into 
  the kind of modern flippers we see on whales today. When you look at a number 
  of fossils in the series, you can see the step-wise nature of the 
  modifications which were favored by natural selection at different junctures. 
  But it's not as if the whales' oldest land ancestor &quot;suddenly&quot; lost four legs 
  and re- appeared the very next day with flippers instead! There were quite a 
  few intermediate steps, and these anatomical transformations (which were 
  probably also accompanied by significant changes in behaviors and habitat 
  utilization) happened over a great many whale generations!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">At every evolutionary juncture in the history 
  of life, the story would likely have been the same: a population occupying a 
  local environment would have, for one reason or another, become reproductively 
  isolated from a larger parent population of the species. The reproductively 
  isolated sub-population would in time have produced and consolidated different 
  anatomical, developmental or behavioral features (relative to the &quot;parent&quot; 
  population) as natural selection and related phenomena operated on a somewhat 
  altered base of genetic variation in the two populations to produce different 
  inheritable traits, and as the two populations encountered somewhat different 
  sets of selection pressures in relation to the particularities of the 
  environment with which they interacted.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">As the ongoing genetic reshuffling and 
  recombination continued to occur in the new species, new features would 
  periodically appear which had never before existed in the ancestral 
  population. Geneticists often like to remind people that &quot;mutants are not 
  monsters&quot;: mutations are simply fairly commonplace &quot;copying errors&quot; which 
  occur in the course of DNA replication when organisms reproduce. They can have 
  large or small effects on the anatomical, developmental, or behavioral traits 
  of individual organisms who inherit these mutations, or they can even produce 
  no noticeable effects at all (so-called &quot;neutral&quot; mutations which nevertheless 
  contribute to overall genetic variability in a population and which may 
  contribute at some later point to the development of some evolutionary 
  modifications). Both mutations and the more routine genetic recombinations 
  which occur at every generation in sexually reproducing organisms can produce 
  traits which, in a given local environment, put the individual at a 
  reproductive disadvantage relative to others in the population. In such a 
  case, natural selection will tend to fairly quickly eliminate this variation 
  from the population. But if a new trait emerges that provides individuals 
  having this feature with a distinct reproductive advantage in a given 
  environment (which is more likely to occur when the environment is itself 
  changing or the daughter species has moved into a new environment), then 
  natural selection can quickly spread this new feature over the generations to 
  greater and greater numbers of descendants.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">It is also important to understand that when 
  reproductively isolated populations &quot;bud off&quot; into new species and accumulate 
  really new and significant evolutionary &quot;innovations&quot; (evolutionary features 
  which did not exist in their ancestors) they can sometimes expand very rapidly 
  and spread into whole new habitats , where they can often make use of a whole 
  range of environmental resources that had never before been available to the 
  ancestor species. In such circumstances, new species may diversify even 
  further , and often relatively rapidly, subdividing into a number of 
  additional daughter species which may have evolved a number of particular 
  &quot;specializations&quot; enabling them to become even more finely-tuned (adapted) to 
  specific components of their new environments and exploit somewhat different 
  types of food, nesting sites, or other such resources.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">This kind of rapid expansion and &quot;adaptive 
  radiation &quot; has been observed to occur when so-called &quot;founder populations&quot; of 
  just a handful of individual organisms manage to colonize islands or other 
  relatively &quot;open&quot; habitats where there are as yet no closely related species, 
  and which may be entirely lacking the particular competitor and/or predator 
  species that the ancestor species had to contend with.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">This is what happened in the case of a family 
  of birds known as the Hawaiian honeycreepers, for instance. A single ancestor 
  species of these birds migrated to these islands in the past but then rather 
  quickly diversified (through repeated speciations) into a great number of 
  closely related species which differ greatly in the shape and size of their 
  beaks. These differences represent different evolutionary modifications (and 
  in this case clear adaptations) in relation to an assortment of available food 
  sources. Studies have shown that even small anatomical modifications in beak 
  size and shape can greatly affect what kind of food birds are able to exploit. 
  Among the many closely related species of Hawaiian honeycreepers, there are 
  species with short thin beaks which eat mainly insects, species with thick 
  stout beaks which eat mainly fruits and hard seeds, and species with long thin 
  beaks which suck nectar out of flowers. And there are also a number of species 
  with features that are intermediate between these types. All these different 
  species are closely related, and are descended from that one single 
  honeycreeper ancestor species which made it to the Islands.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">In the larger-scale history of life on earth 
  this kind of rapid &quot;adaptive radiation&quot; is also the kind of thing that 
  happened when, for instance, a major evolutionary innovation such as the 
  emergence of feathers and lightweight hollow bones suitable for flight &quot;opened 
  up&quot; a whole new environment (the previously unpopulated skies) to what quickly 
  became a veritable explosion of bird species. Major innovations in one line of 
  descent of organisms can also have profound ripple effects on other lines. For 
  instance, biologists generally agree that a tremendous increase in the variety 
  of insect, bird and mammal species in the Cretaceous period, some 140 million 
  years ago, was in many ways tied into the rapidly increasing diversification 
  of flowering plants, a relatively recent evolutionary innovation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">Imagine also the tremendous evolutionary 
  &quot;openings&quot; which were likely encountered by the first species of bony fishes 
  to give rise to the first primitive amphibians some 400 million years ago! 
  These were the very first four-legged creatures to crawl out of the waters and 
  expand onto land. They emerged as only relative slight modifications of some 
  bony fishes which had evolved a couple of anatomical and developmental 
  oddities such as a lung-like air bladder and stumpy leg-like fins. Both of 
  these features would ultimately allow some of their descendants to at least 
  occasionally spend time out of the water. We know from the fossil record that 
  these evolutionary modifications did in fact occur among a group of bony 
  fishes known as the lobe-finned fish (whose living descendants include the 
  very primitive coelacanths and various species of lung-fishes).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">We can only speculate about exactly what 
  reproductive advantages the evolution of air bladders and bony finger or 
  leg-like fins conferred on individuals having these features: perhaps the air 
  bladders allowed some fish to survive periods when pools of water occasionally 
  dried out (as is the case in living lung- fishes), and perhaps modification in 
  the bones of their fins at first just enabled some species of fish to better 
  escape predators or chase after other fish, and then later these emerging 
  structures were co-opted for a new use, to get around on dry land. In any 
  case, fossil skeletons of the very first land-dwelling four-legged animals 
  (the most primitive salamander-like amphibians, which looked a lot like fish 
  with legs!) show extremely close similarities to the skeletons of those 
  water-dwelling lobe-finned fish. And what is truly amazing is that the basic 
  pattern of bones which make up the limb structure of all the later four- 
  legged land-dwellers can already be seen in the underlying structure of the 
  bony fins of those ancient fish ancestors!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="3">No other animals had ever before crawled out 
  onto land, so opportunities for fairly rapid diversification and 
  specializations in relation to different sub-features of local land 
  environments must have abounded. In fact, the fossil record reveals that 
  amphibians would diversify greatly for about 100 million years and also bud 
  off the first reptiles, who would in turn diversify greatly and bud off the 
  first mammals and birds. But each one of these truly major departures in the 
  history of life would have had its origins in simple speciations--the 
  appearance of an increasingly divergent &quot;daughter&quot; species which became 
  reproductively isolated from its parent species, and then began to separately 
  accumulate evolutionary modifications.</font></p>

  taxonomic classification of plants and animals according to their degrees of 
  similarities and relatedness, the following example may be helpful: an <i>
  individual </i>wolf belongs to a reproductive <i>population </i>of wolves in a 
  given region; all the different populations of wolves scattered throughout the 
  range of the wolves make up an entire wolf <i>species. </i></a>All the 
  different but closely related wolf species (such as the Red Wolf, the Mexican 
  Wolf, etc.) get grouped into the wolf<i> genus </i>; all the wolves are then 
  also placed, on the basis of shared features, in the <i>Family </i>of the 
  Canidae (which includes dogs and foxes, but not, for instance, cats, which 
  belong to a different Family); the wolf <i>Family </i>is then grouped along 
  with some other Families (still on the basis of a set of shared similarities) 
  into the <i>Order </i>of Carnivores (meateaters) and the <i>Class </i>of the 
  Mammals (animals which have hair, give birth to live young, produce maternal 
  milk, etc.). So, for instance, wolves would be grouped with other Carnivorous 
  Mammals, such as dogs, foxes, bears, seals and weasels (and there is both 
  fossil and molecular evidence that these animals really do share a common 
  ancestry). Beyond that, our wolf also belongs to the <i>Phylum </i>Chordata 
  (all animals having a backbone) and finally, and most obviously, to the <i>
  Kingdom </i>of Animals (distinguishing them from organisms belonging to the 
  Kingdoms of the plants, the fungi, the algae-like protists or the 
  bacteria-like prokaryotes, which all represented very different evolutionary 
  pathways in the history of life). In real life, the boundaries between species 
  or higher lineages are not always perfectly clear, and species sometimes have 
  to be reclassified into new groups as we learn more about them. But, by and 
  large, the system of biological classification assigns organisms to each

  <font size="3">actually reflect</font> patterns of inheritance from common 
  ancestors, and which distinguish them from evolutionary lines that went off in
