	<h2>The Evidence of Evolution in Action Is All Around Us</h2>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In the <a href="evolution_part1.htm">previous 
	installment of this series</a> (available online at mukto-mona.com) we 
	reflected on how significant it is that life-forms on this planet have not 
	stood still but have actually evolved (changed) over millions and billions 
	of years. We recalled how, for most of human history, people really had no 
	way of understanding scientifically how all the plants and animals, 
	including people, had come to be, so people all over the world had made up 
	all sorts of imaginative stories about mysterious supernatural forces they 
	imagined might be responsible for all this (these stories are the many 
	&quot;origin&quot; and &quot;creation&quot; myths, which became part of the different religions 
	of the world). It was not until comparatively recently (a mere 140 years ago 
	or so) that the great naturalist Charles Darwin figured out how life had 
	evolved through purely natural means, over hundreds of millions of years. 
	The discovery of evolution by means of natural selection--which thousands of 
	scientists since Darwin's time have been able to test and verify over and 
	over again --was one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time. 
	Like the Copernican discovery that the earth is not in fact the center of 
	the universe and that the earth orbits around the sun, rather than the other 
	way around, the discovery of evolution completely revolutionized the way 
	people think about the history of our planet and all its life-forms, 
	including people. From that point on, the science of evolution provided a 
	foundation upon which all modern science continues to build.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Last time we reviewed a few basics about <i>how </i>
	evolutionary change takes place, focusing particularly on explaining that 
	fundamental mechanism of evolutionary change which is known as Darwinian 
	natural selection (and we also briefly discussed some additional mechanisms 
	which contribute to evolutionary change, including genetic drift and founder 
	effects.) In later installments of this series, we will further explore the 
	evidence concerning the really large-scale (&quot;macro-evolutionary&quot;) changes 
	which have taken place over the course of the past 3 1/2 billion years of 
	life's history on this planet (such as how we really know that mammals were 
	descended from reptilian ancestors, or that whales were descended from a 
	four-legged terrestrial mammal, or that our own distant ancestors were also 
	the ancestors of the modern-day chimpanzees and gorillas, our closest living 
	relatives). We will see that evidence for many of the kinds of major 
	evolutionary changes which took place in the past hundreds of millions of 
	years can be found in such things as the patterns of similarities and 
	differences between species (in both the fossil record and in living 
	species) and in the many particularities of plants and animals which only 
	make sense if they are in fact consequences of evolution.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In short, there is lots of concrete evidence about 
	the large-scale evolutionary changes which marked life's history for the 
	past 3 1/2 billion years. But evolution is not just something that happened 
	in the past: it is a process that is happening all the time, in all living 
	things. So this installment is going to start off by bringing out a few 
	examples of the kind of evolutionary change that we can easily observe 
	taking place all around us. These are the kinds of evolutionary changes that 
	are taking place <i>within populations and species </i>of plants or animals 
	and that are sometimes referred to as &quot;microevolution,&quot; to distinguish them 
	from what is sometimes called &quot;macroevolution,&quot; the larger-scale patterns of 
	evolution above the species level, involving such things as the emergence 
	and successive branchings of whole larger taxa and lineages (groups of 
	groups), spread out over millions and hundreds of millions of years.<sup><a name="Footnote 1" href="#Footnote text 1">1</a></sup>

	<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Evolution in Action Today </p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So can we actually see evolution in action<i> today
	</i>? Absolutely.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As a fundamental characteristic of living matter, 
	evolution is <i>always </i>going on. Many people don't realize this, because 
	they are confused about what evolution is (and what it is not) and so they 
	don't know what to look for. It is important to realize that, even though 
	the &quot;raw material&quot; of evolutionary change can be found in the inheritable 
	characteristics of variable<i> individuals </i>, overall evolutionary change 
	is something that is best observed at the level of <i>whole populations </i>
	and <i>whole species </i>of plants and animals, and<i> over many generations
	</i>.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Let's just go over a few well-known examples of 
	smaller-scale evolutionary changes which happen so quickly, relative to 
	human lifespans, that we can actually <i>see </i>them happening.</font></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<b><font face="Verdana">
	<p>Rapid evolutionary change observed in a population of moths</p>
	</font><font face="Arial Narrow"></font></b>
	<p><font face="Verdana">If you ever studied evolution in school, you 
	probably have heard of the moth species <b>Biston betularia,</b>also known 
	as the peppered moth. This particular species of moth has been studied in 
	England over many successive generations and provides an excellent example 
	of evolution by natural selection which can be directly observed.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 2" href="#Footnote text 2">2</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Until the middle of the 19th century, almost all <i>
	B. betularia </i>moths were very <i>light grey </i>in color. Up until that 
	time, the bark of the local trees was also light in color, so when the moths 
	rested on the tree trunks during the daytime, they tended to &quot;blend into&quot; 
	the background. Because of this, local birds looking for insects to eat 
	probably tended to miss a lot of these light-colored moths. But then an odd 
	thing happened: with the increase in the development of industry, starting 
	in the late 19th century, the air became increasingly polluted with black 
	dirt and soot from the local factories; and, as a consequence of this, the 
	bark of the local trees became much darker. This in itself was not so 
	surprising. But what was really interesting was that the local moth 
	populations <i>also </i>became much darker! Pretty soon people noticed that 
	the light-colored moths had been almost entirely replaced by moths with 
	black wings. What people were witnessing here was evolution in action--a 
	classic example of the kind of commonplace evolutionary changes that happen 
	through<i> natural selection </i>, in this case leading to a striking <i>
	adaptation </i>of the moth populations to their changing environment.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This is what happened:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The original population of moths was made up of<i> 
	varied individuals </i>. <i>Most </i>of them were light-colored, but within 
	the total population there were a few dark colored variants. Prior to 
	industrialization, the light-colored moths greatly outnumbered the darker 
	moths; dark-colored moths would really show up against the light bark of the 
	trees and, on average, they would get picked off by birds more often than 
	the better camouflaged light-colored moths. So, in that particular 
	environment, the light-colored individuals had what biologists call &quot;<i> a 
	differential reproductive advantage&quot;</i><u> </u>relative to the dark-colored 
	moths. This simply means that, since the light-colored moths tended not to 
	get eaten as often as the dark-colored moths, they were, on average, better 
	able to survive and therefore were more likely to produce descendants. Since 
	the genetic variability for wing-color happens to be an <i>inheritable </i>
	characteristic, the surviving moths <i>passed on </i>this characteristic to 
	their descendants, who passed it on to their descendants, and so on. For as 
	long as the tree bark remained light-colored, light-colored moths had a 
	&quot;selective advantage&quot; and the moth populations were <i>almost exclusively
	</i>made up of light-colored variants. There were still occasional dark 
	variants around, but they were very rare.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This situation began to change dramatically when the 
	environment changed and the trees became black with soot: now those very 
	rare individuals who just happened to have dark wings (because the genetic 
	information for black wings had not been completely &quot;lost&quot; from the total 
	genetic pool of the whole population) were the ones that had a significant 
	reproductive advantage--they were now the ones that birds most often 
	&quot;missed&quot;, and so they were the ones that, on average, were most often able 
	to survive and produce descendants. In this way, over a number of 
	generations, the numbers of dark moths increased and became a bigger and 
	bigger<i> proportion of the total population </i>. It got to the point where 
	pretty much the only moths you would have been likely to see on a given day 
	were the ones with dark wings.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The moth population had<i> evolved </i>!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is also interesting to note that in more recent 
	years this overall evolutionary trend has apparently <i>reversed </i>itself 
	in some localities: as the quality of the air has improved, and the amount 
	of industrial soot in the air has been reduced, the tree trunks have once 
	again become lighter in color. In step with this environmental change, the 
	populations of moths have once again evolved, but this time back in the 
	direction of being mainly made up of the light-colored types. This change 
	was possible because the genetic information for light-colored wings was 
	still present in the <i>total </i>genetic pool of the population: even in 
	the days when the population was made up almost entirely of dark moths, 
	there were always <i>a few </i>light-colored moths around. They were rare, 
	but the fact that a few such individuals were still around at each 
	generation was enough to provide the genetic basis for the proportion of 
	light- colored individuals in the total population to begin to increase once 
	again when the environment changed and the dark colored moths once again 
	became more visible to the bird predators. <u>With</u><i>every passing 
	generation<u> </u></i>, the dark moths on average produced fewer 
	descendants, and the light moths on average once again produced more 
	descendants. This classic example of natural selection is all it took for 
	the moth population to evolve once again.
	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="GoTo Box 1 -  &quot;The Moth Flap&quot;]" href="moth_flap.htm">[See &quot;The Moth Flap&quot;]</a></font></p>
	<p><b><font face="Verdana">Where would we be without fruit flies?</p>
	</font></b>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Since evolutionary change only happens<i> over a 
	series of generations </i>, it is always helpful to be able to study plants 
	or animals which produce new generations very<i> quickly </i>. This is why 
	various species of tiny fruit flies (<i> Drosophila </i>) became so famous 
	in biology: they are easy to raise in a controlled laboratory environment, 
	they reproduce many new generations in just a few months, and it even turns 
	out that their DNA is relatively easy to work with. In the first half of the 
	20th century, scientists like the geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky observed 
	populations of fruit flies in the lab and in the wild. Dobzhansky conducted 
	many experiments, such as artificially &quot;selecting&quot; flies for certain 
	features like eye color, wing shape, number or position of legs, and so on; 
	and he observed how the proportions of individuals with different features
	<i>shifted </i>over the generations under various conditions. These kinds of 
	studies made it possible to better work out the principles of inheritance 
	and to figure out what exactly is going on <i>at the genetic level </i>when 
	populations are evolving. In many cases it was possible to closely <i>
	correlate </i>(clearly connect) the shifts taking place in the proportions 
	of individuals in a population having certain distinct features (a certain 
	eye color, for instance) with the changes occurring from generation to 
	generation in the underlying gene frequencies. For example, an increase in 
	the &quot;proportion of flies with red eyes&quot; in a population could be shown to be
	<i>directly connected </i>with an increase in the &quot;frequency of the allele 
	(gene variant) that `codes' for red eyes&quot; in the total genetic pool of that 
	same population.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 3" href="#Footnote text 3">3</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Darwin had figured out how natural selection works 
	on <i>populations of varied individuals </i>to cause evolutionary change, 
	and he knew that only <i>inheritable </i>characteristics were relevant for 
	evolution by natural selection over successive generations. But he never 
	understood what the <i>source </i>of that individual inheritable variation 
	really was, because in those days nobody knew yet about genes and DNA or 
	even how inheritable characteristics get transmitted from one generation to 
	the next.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 4" href="#Footnote text 4">4</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In fact it was the <i>combination </i>of Darwin's <i>
	theory of evolution </i>with the advances made in the new field of <i>
	genetics </i>that made possible the <i>&quot;modern synthesis&quot;</i> developed in 
	the first half of the 20th century--a much more complete and comprehensive 
	understanding of the underlying dynamics of evolutionary change.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Our deepening understanding of how evolution works 
	now allows us to do all sorts of new things, such as <i>combining </i>
	evidence derived from different sources (for example, evidence from the 
	fossil record and evidence from a molecular analysis of the DNA of living 
	species) to more accurately reconstruct past evolutionary pathways and to 
	identify at what points on the evolutionary tree of life different ancestor 
	and descendant lineages branched off from each other. Combining an 
	understanding of the basic principles of evolution with the basic principles 
	of genetic inheritance has also made it possible to do such things as 
	improve treatments of many diseases; make bacteria produce medicines (such 
	as insulin) for use by human beings; and develop new strains of domesticated 
	plants or animals in agriculture.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">None of this would be possible if evolution weren't 
	true and if we didn't have some understanding of basic evolutionary 
	mechanisms and principles. The whole new field of &quot;genetic engineering&quot; is a 
	case in point. There is nothing &quot;inherently evil&quot; in the idea of human 
	beings seeking to transform living matter for the benefit of humanity--this 
	is, after all, what plant and animal breeders have been doing for centuries, 
	through more traditional techniques of artificial selection, and it is a 
	fact that human beings cannot live without in some way consuming and 
	transforming other species of living plants and animals. However, many 
	people are justifiably concerned that the whole new field of genetic 
	engineering may lead to an unprecedented degree of careless and poorly 
	thought-through genetic and evolutionary &quot;tinkering.&quot; Left in the wrong 
	hands (keyed to private profits, and/or pressed to serve reactionary social 
	objectives, as was the case with the development of the ability to &quot;tinker&quot; 
	with nuclear energy, for instance) advances in the field of genetic 
	engineering could well have some very bad consequences for both human health 
	and the health and relative stability of entire ecosystems. Genetic 
	engineering is a subject for a whole other discussion best left for another 
	day. But I raise it here in passing to once again make the point that, <i>if 
	evolution were not true </i>(as the Creationists would like us to believe), 
	if evolution were not a <i>real </i>phenomenon, then fields like genetic 
	engineering (and both the good and bad that they are doing and can 
	potentially do) </font><i><font face="Verdana">would not even exist!</font></p>
	<p></i><font face="Verdana">The Creationists say they &quot;don't believe in 
	evolution,&quot; but they certainly do live in a world where <i>people constantly 
	use the rules of evolution </i>to transform their world, for better or for 
	worse.</font></p>
	<p><b><font face="Verdana">One species splitting into two on opposite sides 
	of the Grand Canyon:</font></p>
	<p></b><font face="Verdana">A bit later in this series I will be discussing 
	at greater length what scientists now understand about the evolutionary 
	processes whereby <i>a whole new species of plant or animal can come into 
	being </i>as a modification and departure from its immediately preceding 
	ancestors--a process known as &quot;<i> speciation </i>.&quot; Since my purpose in 
	this installment is mainly to give readers a bit of a feel for the kinds of 
	evolutionary change which are constantly going on and which we can see 
	happening all around us, let me give just one example of a case where two 
	populations have actually been <i>observed </i>(over a number of 
	generations) as they have begun to diverge into separate species.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Any time you have a situation where different 
	populations belonging to the same species become<i> reproductively isolated 
	from each other (for many generations)</i>, there is the potential for 
	speciation to take place. In everyday life, <i>complete </i>speciation 
	doesn't take place all that often, because what often happens is that two 
	populations which have been reproductively cut off from each other (by some 
	kind of physical barrier, for example) often end up getting back together 
	after a while (for instance, if the barrier disappears or is removed) and so 
	they once again begin to mate with each other and mix up their genetic 
	material in one single big genetic pool, which prevents the speciation 
	process from going forward. But sometimes different populations of one 
	species remain reproductively isolated <i>long enough </i>that speciation 
	can actually be completed (to the point where individuals of the two 
	populations would not be able to successfully mate and reproduce any more, 
	even if they once again shared the same locality).</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The case of the Kaibab and Abert's squirrels that 
	live in the area of the Grand Canyon shows what happens when one species 
	begins to diverge (split) into two. In the fairly recent past, the ancestors 
	of these two types of squirrels were<i> one single species </i>, made up of 
	individuals that all looked pretty much the same. But in one area, two 
	populations of these squirrels found themselves separated from each other, 
	just because they happened to end up on opposite sides of a significant 
	physical barrier--the Grand Canyon! Because they are not able to easily 
	cross the Canyon, individuals in the two populations have become effectively<i> 
	reproductively isolated </i>: they are unable to get together to mate and 
	produce offspring. And because of this reproductive isolation, the two 
	populations no longer share the same total pool of genetic information. Each 
	population is <i>missing </i>some of the genetic information available in 
	the other, which would have been available in the total genetic pool of the 
	larger population of the original species. To use an analogy, it's a little 
	bit as if each of the smaller populations had accidentally ended up with 
	only a part of the alphabet (rather than the whole alphabet), and on top of 
	that the two populations had ended up with <i>different </i>parts of the 
	whole alphabet. So not only is each population &quot;missing&quot; some genetic 
	information, but each is also &quot;reshuffling&quot; the overall genetic information 
	available to it (its part of the alphabet) somewhat differently at each 
	generation. This has important consequences: As each reproductively isolated 
	population produces generation after generation <i>without the ability to 
	tap into the gene pool of the other population,</i>it begins to accumulate 
	different kinds and degrees of changes in its total genetic variability.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This is exactly what happened with the two 
	populations of Grand Canyon squirrels: They are all still recognizable as 
	squirrels, and they still have many features in common (they eat the same 
	kinds of food, for instance), <u>but </u>the proportions of certain gene 
	frequencies in each population has changed. The normal processes of random 
	mutation and genetic recombination (which take place whenever organisms 
	reproduce) have sorted themselves out somewhat <i>differently </i>in the two 
	populations, which is what you'd expect if they weren't working with the 
	same total gene pool to begin with. As a result, the two populations have 
	been diverging into two different species and they are becoming increasingly 
	different in appearance.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 5" href="#Footnote text 5">5</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">For instance, the Abert's squirrels, which live only 
	on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, all have a grey body, a reddish back, 
	and a dark tail. The Kaibab squirrels, which live only on the North Rim, all 
	the way across on the other side of the Canyon, are grey with a white tail.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As long as they are unable to regularly interbreed 
	and &quot;mix up&quot; their total genetic variation into one larger genetic pool, the 
	two reproductively isolated populations will <i>continue </i>to accumulate 
	different changes. They have already become different in appearance, and it 
	is quite possible that as they continue to evolve separately in their 
	different localities they will eventually exhibit even more significant 
	differences, including in certain behaviors and ways of interacting with 
	their environments (they might begin to eat different kinds of foods, for 
	instance), simply due to the fact that the automatic reshuffling and sorting 
	out of genetic variability which occurs from one generation to the next is 
	now taking place on a somewhat different genetic basis in the two 
	populations.<i> And these differences will keep getting accentuated the 
	longer the two populations remain reproductively separate </i>.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 6" href="#Footnote text 6">6</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Through the normal processes of random mutation and 
	genetic reshuffling occurring at each new generation, whole <i>new </i>
	characteristics which have never before appeared in <i>either </i>population 
	will keep showing up, but they will be <i>different </i>in the two 
	populations and will therefore contribute to pulling them further and 
	further apart.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 7" href="#Footnote text 7">7</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The Kaibab and Abert's squirrels' divergence into 
	two separate species over a number of successive generations is yet another 
	example of evolution taking place in the world around us-- a change that 
	people can actually go out and <i>directly observe </i>taking place over a 
	reasonable time- span. We may not have been able to be there when the first 
	terrestrial vertebrates (ancestors of today's frogs and salamanders) evolved 
	from those odd fishes which had evolved a primitive air breathing &quot;lung&quot; 
	some 400 million years ago; or when the first birds evolved from the 
	feathered relatives of the dinosaurs some 200 million years ago; but that 
	doesn't mean we can't witness the frequent emergence of genuine evolutionary 
	novelties on a smaller scale--and even the first steps in the occasional 
	emergence of whole new species--taking place all around us.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The really <i>major </i>evolutionary transitions in 
	the history of life were generally built up step- wise, and were in any case 
	spread out over millions or hundreds of millions of years. But the basic 
	underlying principles and mechanisms involved would have <i>included </i>
	much of the same kinds of processes and changes we see taking place on a 
	smaller scale in the world around us every day.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Just don't expect to ever see an individual plant or 
	animal &quot;instantly&quot; transform itself before your eyes, or one species 
	instantly turn into another species, as if by some kind of magic trick--that 
	never happens, and that's not what evolution is about.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">We know, for instance, that the ancestor of modern 
	whales was actually a four-legged ungulate (a type of hoofed mammal) that 
	lived on land, not in the ocean. We know this both from the fossil record 
	and from the evidence of the degree of genetic relatedness of whales to 
	certain lines of terrestrial mammals even today. But we <u>also </u>know 
	that this whole process took place through a whole series of<i> transitional 
	species </i>, each one representing an evolutionary &quot;modification&quot; of its 
	immediately preceding ancestor. The Creationists like to claim that there 
	are no &quot;intermediate&quot; fossils in the fossil record and that this shows that 
	evolution by &quot;descent with modification&quot; is just something that 
	evolutionists made up. Well, actually, there are quite a few good 
	intermediate fossils (and we'll come back to that whole question in a later 
	installment of this series). A case in point is the series of fossils of 
	related species which link that four-legged ungulate ancestor to its later 
	whale descendants through a dozen or so transitional species. These fossils 
	reveal what in this case is a pretty clear-cut sequence of step-wise 
	modifications, from a body shape more suited to life on land to one suited 
	for life in the sea--all taking place over a period of 25 million years or 
	so.<sup><a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote 8" href="#Footnote text 8">8</a></sup>&nbsp;

								<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
								<font face="Arial" color="#008000"><br>
								Another well-known example of evolution which 
								can be directly observed in the world around us 
								right now is the evolution of sickle-cell 
								hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a blood protein which 
								helps blood carry oxygen to the lungs. There are 
								two different variants (slightly different 
								varieties) of the hemoglobin gene in humans. 
								Let's call them the A allele and the S allele 
								(an allele is just an alternate form of a gene). 
								A human being inherits one hemoglobin allele 
								from each parent, so each individual will have 
								either the AA, AS, or SS combination of 
								hemoglobin alleles. People born with the SS 
								combination (who have 2 copies of the S or 
								&quot;sickle cell&quot; allele) are in trouble, because 
								this combination causes sickle cell disease, a 
								serious form of anemia which can be lethal. This 
								is a public health issue that needs special 
								attention because populations of Africans and 
								people of African descent (including African- 
								Americans) have a higher proportion of sickle 
								cell alleles than other populations, and so it 
								is important to pay extra attention to screening 
								for sickle cell and providing treatment in 
								populations of African ancestry in particular.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
								<font face="Arial" color="#008000"><br>
								What could possibly explain this evolutionary 
								quirk which makes people of African descent more 
								susceptible to sickle cell disease and causes 
								them such extra grief and hardship? Is it that 
								Black people are inherently more &quot;unhealthy&quot; 
								than Europeans? Is it that Black people have 
								been singled out by God for special punishment? 
								Not at all. Evolution supplies a clear-cut and 
								simple answer: people who are heterozygotes for 
								sickle cell (which simply means that they are 
								born with the AS combination, having just one of 
								the sickle cell alleles) actually have an 
								advantage (a health benefit) in those parts of 
								the world where another serious 
								disease--malaria--is commonplace (as it is in 
								large parts of Africa). It turns out that having 
								just one copy of the sickle cell gene actually 
								protects you against malaria ! It is for this 
								reason that the allele for sickle cell would 
								have been preserved in the course of the 
								evolutionary history of human beings, rather 
								than eliminated by natural selection. In parts 
								of the world where there is a lot of malaria, 
								individuals born with one copy of the sickle 
								cell allele would have had a better chance of 
								surviving long enough to bear children than 
								people who didn't have any sickle cell alleles 
								at all and who might die from malaria. The 
								survivors with the one sickle cell gene would 
								have passed it on to their children, who would 
								have passed it on to their children...and each 
								individual who inherited just one sickle cell 
								allele would have had a &quot;selective advantage&quot; in 
								surviving malaria. Sadly, a certain number of 
								people in each generation would have been 
								unlucky enough to inherit two copies of the 
								sickle cell gene (one from each parent) and 
								these individuals would likely get severe sickle 
								cell disease and die without leaving any 
								children at all. If a god were responsible for 
								this suffering and death it would be an outrage! 
								Why would a god give people malaria or sickle 
								cell disease in the first place? And why would 
								an all-powerful Creator have to come up with 
								such a convoluted and imperfect scheme to 
								protect people against malaria? Surely an 
								all-powerful god could do better than that.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
								<font face="Arial" color="#008000"><br>
								Natural selection, however, does not produce 
								&quot;perfect&quot; solutions. It is a &quot;blind&quot; natural 
								process, which makes no judgments and takes 
								place automatically, without the involvement of 
								any outside consciousness or the guiding hand of 
								any &quot;intelligent designer.&quot; Evolution by natural 
								selection is neither inherently &quot;good&quot; nor 
								inherently &quot;evil.&quot; It just is . If the only 
								thing the allele for sickle cell did was cause a 
								fatal disease, natural selection would, most 
								likely, have eliminated it entirely from human 
								populations at some point. This is because, if 
								sickle cell genes had no beneficial side effects 
								at all and only caused disease, individuals 
								having no sickle cell alleles at all would 
								likely, on average, produce more descendants 
								than people with even one such allele. But 
								because one single sickle cell allele, in 
								combination with a non-sickle cell allele, 
								actually allows people in areas where malaria is 
								a problem to be protected from that disease (and 
								therefore likely live longer and have a better 
								chance of leaving healthy descendants), natural 
								selection will tend to &quot;conserve&quot; the sickle 
								cell allele from generation to generation in 
								human populations who live in those regions. And 
								this will happen even though this will be at the 
								cost of a number of individuals who end up 
								inheriting two copies of the gene and getting 
								that severe sickle cell disease. Again, natural 
								selection is not making any judgments, and it is 
								not consciously favoring some humans over 
								others: it is simply an unconscious process 
								which sorts out the relative proportions of 
								different inheritable alleles in a population of 
								varied individuals, as a simple by-product 
								(nothing more) of how many descendants different 
								individuals are ultimately able to contribute to 
								the next generation.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
								<font face="Arial" color="#008000"><br>
								Think about this: if you didn't understand this,

								works, you might mistakenly believe that Black 
								people were somehow being mysteriously singled 
								out for some kind of special punishment since 
								people of African descent tend to get more 
								sickle cell disease than Europeans, for 
								instance. This is just one more example of why 
								it's so important for everyone to: a) understand 
								how we know for sure evolution is a fact of 
								life, b) learn the basics of how evolution 
								works, and c) strongly oppose any religious

	<p><font face="Verdana">Despite all the evidence to support evolution,

	like Jerry Falwell attend White House dinners and counsel Presidents,</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">at least two of the Justices on the current Supreme 
	Court would, if it were just up to them, have imposed the teaching of 
	anti-evolution Creationism in science classrooms, and when the current 
	President was asked if he believed in evolution he supposedly answered that 
	&quot;the verdict is still out&quot;!!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><b>Imagine</b>:</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">If Creationists ran the university science 
	departments, research institutions and hospital wards, what chance would we 
	have of effectively countering the evolution of drug-resistance in bacteria 
	and viruses?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">If Creationists ran agricultural research stations, 
	what chance would we have of counteracting the evolution of pesticide- 
	resistant &quot;super-pests&quot; which can severely limit and disrupt the production 
	of food?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">If Creationists had the power and authority to 
	dictate policy and curtail the work of evolution-trained ecologists, 
	population geneticists and conservationists, what hope would we have of 
	being able to reduce and prevent critical animal and plant extinctions, of 
	recognizing the essential value of biological diversity, and of being able 
	to conserve critical ecosystems?</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Creationists have a reactionary social and political 
	agenda which requires them to attempt by every means possible to replace the 
	scientific teaching of evolution with the unscientific teaching of Biblical 
	creationism. So think about the implications of this the next time you hear 
	people at your local public school arguing that &quot;creation-science&quot; should 
	perhaps be given &quot;<i> equal time </i>&quot; with evolution and taught in the 
	science classrooms; or the next time you open your kid's biology textbook 
	only to discover that the editors have inserted a &quot;disclaimer&quot; stating that 
	evolution is &quot;just one of a number of competing theories&quot; and students are 
	therefore free to believe in anti- evolution creationism if they prefer; or 
	the next time an entire state like Kansas, or now Ohio, becomes a backward 
	laughing stock by actually debating whether <i>state laws </i>should be 
	passed to order schools to teach creationism; and think about this the <i>
	next </i>time this battle goes all the way up to the Supreme Court, and 
	maybe they can scrounge up a few more reactionary and ignorant Justices to 
	dissent from all reason and actually order the teaching of creationism.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><i>All ideas are not equally true </i>: some ideas 
	much more closely correspond to the way things <i>really are </i>in the 
	world than other ideas. Promoting ideas which have <i>long </i>been proven 
	to be false (such as creationism, in opposition to evolution) has genuine 
	harmful social implications in the real world.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So no, it's not OK to teach creationism as if it 
	were an acceptable &quot;alternate&quot; scientific theory, &quot;just so all points of 
	view can be heard.&quot; Not when the truth of evolution is<i> so well 
	established.</i></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So please,<i> think about it </i>. Think about it 
	the next time someone you know is tempted to say things like &quot;maybe things 
	would be better if kids were exposed to more religion in the schools.&quot; Or 
	&quot;maybe it wouldn't do any harm to give Biblical creation stories equal time 
	with the theory of evolution in the science classrooms--the kids should be 
	able to decide, right?&quot; <i>Wrong! </i>Should the flat-earth theory be given 
	equal time? Should science teachers be forced to teach it as a valid 
	scientific theory? Should children be &quot;free to decide&quot; whether the earth is 
	flat or round?</font></p>

	Macroevolutionary and microevolutionary changes are features of different

	trace evidence of those changes which are preserved in such things as 
	fossils, or the patterns of distribution and degrees of similarities and 
	differences between living species; we are often able to gather much more 
	direct evidence of microevolutionary changes as they are taking place, since 
	they are going on all the time in populations of present-day plants and

	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" name="Footnote text 3">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is 
	important to realize that particular genes, contained inside individuals, 
	are not in and of themselves direct targets of selection--it is <i>whole 
	individuals </i>that do or do not successfully reproduce, contributing 
	offspring with varied features to the next generation. And it is these whole 
	individuals (each with a complex mix of features which cannot be simply 
	reduced to the individual's underlying genetic make-up) who are targets of 
	the &quot;sorting out process&quot; of selection. In a given environment, those 
	individuals who end up contributing more descendants to the next generation 
	will obviously end up having contributed more genes overall to the next 
	generations than those individuals who did not produce as many descendants. 
	But the underlying genes themselves do not directly &quot;cause&quot; evolutionary 
	shifts in populations; these shifts occur when the proportion in a 
	population of whole individuals with certain characteristics changes 
	(through selection and related factors), and these shifts are then <i>
	reflected </i>in changes in certain gene frequencies (some will increase, 
	some will decrease) in the total population. This, in turn, will affect the 
	total amount of genetic variability available as raw material for ongoing 
	evolutionary changes.</a></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Keep in mind also that it is not often, in any 
	species, that a single gene (such as the allele that codes for red eyes in 
	fruit flies) can be so neatly tied to a <i>single </i>characteristic. 
	Geneticists have known for some time now that most of the characteristics of 
	individuals that are inheritable (the only ones relevant for evolution) are 
	affected by a <i>number </i>of different interacting genes, acting in 
	concert in some complex and not well understood ways; in addition, most 
	genes have influences and effects on <i>more than one </i>characteristic at 
	the level of the whole individual organism. Furthermore, many of the 
	characteristics of whole organisms are shaped by complex interactions of 
	these whole organisms with their outside environments and therefore cannot 
	be reduced to the effects of underlying genes. (It is worth remembering that 
	genes are just sections of DNA that make different kinds of proteins in the 
	body). Nevertheless, it is the case that the underlying genetic variability 
	that exists within any population of plants or animals (and which codes for 
	those features which can be passed on to descendants) serves as the raw 
	material through which much overall evolutionary change is realized.</font></p>

	are very interested in understanding better under what conditions true 
	evolutionary &quot;novelties&quot;-- characteristics which have never before 
	existed--are most likely to emerge. There is evidence to suggest that such 
	brand-new features are especially likely to appear in populations of plants 
	or animals that are particularly<i> small </i>. It has been shown 
	experimentally (including, once again, in fruit flies!) that smaller 
	populations tend to accumulate novel features more readily than larger ones. 
	It may be that the overall reduction in total genetic variability (that is, 
	the relative &quot;genetic impoverishment&quot;) of small isolated populations serves 
	to &quot;relax&quot; some of the developmentally <i>constraining </i>(limiting) 
	factors associated with a more diverse overall genetic mix (as would be 
	present in larger populations), and this may more readily allow radical 
	evolutionary departures from the relatively more static (more unchanging) 
	features which often seem to characterize larger populations or groups of 
	populations. This is a phenomenon which has been explored in particular by 
	the biologist Ernst Mayr, who has contributed perhaps more than anyone to 
	the modern understanding of speciation. The relative ability of smaller 
	populations to depart from the conditions of relative stasis (relative 
	&quot;steady-state&quot;) of larger populations of the same species is a phenomenon 
	occurring at the <i>population </i>level, but it would seem to 
	interpenetrate in some interesting ways with models of punctuated equilibria 
	proposed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to explain the patterns of 
	larger scale evolution at the level of higher taxa (larger plant or animal

	actually have been realized through relatively rapid and concentrated bursts

	short period of time, or in an accelerated way: these changes would still 
	have been spread out over what-- from a human perspective--would have been

	about the fact that, regardless of whatever other factors might have (to a 
	greater or lesser degree) affected the overall tempo and pacing of these 
	major changes, the well-known mechanisms of basic Darwinian evolution at the 
	population and species levels would have been part of the &quot;mix.&quot;</a></font></p>
