	<p><font face="Verdana"><b>More on Reproductive Isolation, Speciation, and 
	the Emergence of Evolutionary Novelties</b></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As we discussed in the last installment of this 
	series {<a href="evolution_part4.htm">The Science of Evolution (part-4)</a>}, 
	divergence between two reproductively isolated populations which had once 
	belonged to the same species is one of the main ways new species can come 
	into being. There is evidence to suggest that new species are especially 
	likely to emerge out of especially <i>small </i>pockets of individuals which 
	in one or another way have become reproductively cut off from the original 
	population and which then begin to accumulate evolutionary changes <i>at a 
	disproportionately rapid rate (and with disproportionately significant 
	effects),</i>as compared to the kind of more routine ongoing small-scale 
	evolutionary changes which continue to take place in the larger original 
	population. In such cases, the original ancestral species may simply <i>
	continue to exist, </i>in the usual environment and in a relatively 
	unchanged state, while the new species emerging out of the small &quot;founder 
	population&quot; may fairly quickly spread out, often occupying and interacting
	<i>in new ways </i>with a somewhat different local environment than the 
	original species.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>Mechanisms of Reproductive Isolation</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">How can two populations become reproductively 
	isolated from each other in the first place? There are actually many 
	different ways this can happen. Often the initial reproductive separation 
	can be caused by a <i>physical geographic barrier,</i>as can happen when two 
	populations remain separated for some time by sandbars, canyons (as in the 
	case of the diverging species of Kaibab and Abert squirrels discussed in an 
	earlier installment), bodies of water, mountain ranges, and the like. But 
	sometimes, especially when two related populations have already remained 
	geographically separate for some time--and have accumulated enough changes 
	to at least <i>begin </i>the process of diverging into two different 
	species--the two populations will continue to remain effectively 
	&quot;reproductively isolated&quot; even if they once again come to occupy the <i>same
	</i>local area. This might be because they have already accumulated 
	sufficient genetic differences that they <i>no longer reproduce at the same 
	time </i>(for instance, when two populations of trees, even in the same 
	habitat, tend to flower at slightly different times, or when two populations 
	of closely related animals no longer mate in quite the same season), or 
	because they <i>have adapted to occupying somewhat different &quot;niches&quot; 
	(sub-sets of environmental variables) and to using somewhat different means 
	of exploiting the resources of the habitats they occupy </i>even in the very 
	same local area (as when closely related species live and feed at ground 
	level or in the canopy level [tree-tops] of a rain forest). In the case of 
	many mammal and bird species, sufficient reproductive isolation for full 
	speciation to take place often seems to occur when different populations 
	have accumulated significant<i> behavioral differences in genetically 
	encoded mating rituals or other forms of communication </i>: in such cases, 
	individuals from two populations no longer recognize each other as potential 
	mates even if they come across each other in the same general habitat, and 
	therefore they don't even attempt to mate.<sup><a name="back1" href="#foot1">1</a></sup>
	</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>Especially <i>Small </i>Reproductively Isolated Populations Can Exhibit 
	More Evolutionary &quot;Novelties&quot; and Rapid Evolutionary Change</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I want to stress again the importance to the 
	speciation process of the kinds of changes that can rapidly accumulate in 
	especially <i>small </i>reproductively isolated populations. Many of the 
	routine genetic reshufflings which occur in the bigger gene pool of a large 
	ancestor population may have dampened (or limited) effects (slight back and 
	forth quantitative increases or decreases in one or another developmental 
	variable, for instance) and lead to little in the way of significant 
	evolutionary modifications. Such a large original population may remain for 
	long periods in a relatively unchanged state (in what is sometimes referred 
	to as &quot;relative stasis&quot;), especially if the external environment is not 
	changing to any significant degree, and if the process of evolution has had 
	a relatively long period of time through which to &quot;fine-tune&quot; many of this 
	population's interactions with its relatively stable environment. But in a 
	really <i>small </i>and reproductively isolated off-shoot population--which 
	by definition starts off with only a <i>small portion </i>of the total 
	genetic variability available in the ancestral stock--even relatively <i>
	minor </i>genetic mutations and recombinations (as well as changes in total 
	genetic variation caused by migration or simple genetic drift) may have 
	disproportionately large effects on the overall genetic make-up of the small 
	population.<sup><a name="back2" href="#foot2">2</a></sup> </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So the particularities of the gene pool of a 
	particularly <i>small </i>population may facilitate the appearance and 
	consolidation of genuine evolutionary novelties which might be much less 
	likely to appear, or to become consolidated, in a larger ancestor 
	population. This has been suggested in particular by the veteran 
	evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr, who has perhaps contributed more than 
	anyone else to our understanding of speciation (including through the 
	&quot;budding off&quot; from a much larger population of &quot;founder populations,&quot; 
	consisting of very small numbers of individuals). Mayr points out that 
	people often mistakenly assume that new species arise only when one species 
	splits into two completely new species, which are then assumed to both 
	proceed to accumulate evolutionary changes at about the same rates. But this 
	misses the fact that an ancestor species often continues to maintain itself 
	in a given environment even after a &quot;daughter&quot; species has &quot;budded off,&quot; and 
	that the <i>rate </i>of accumulation of subsequent evolutionary 
	modifications (as well as the qualitative impacts of any such changes) may 
	be very different in the smaller reproductively isolated off-shoot 
	population than in the larger populations of the original parent species.</font><sup><font face="Verdana"><a name="back3" href="#foot3">3</a></font></p>
	</sup>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is also important to realize that smaller 
	off-shoot populations (which have become reproductively isolated from a 
	parent population) often encounter <i>different sets of environmental 
	conditions </i>than their parent populations. This is especially likely to 
	happen if the off-shoot population has ended up in a very different 
	locality, where it may encounter such things as different food sources or a 
	different mix of competitors or predators. But even if the off-shoot 
	population finds itself interacting with what appears to be a very similar 
	environment as the parent population, it may do so <i>in completely new 
	ways,</i>simply because changes in the underlying genetic variation of the 
	population have brought forth some significantly different individual 
	features. So, for these reasons as well, natural selection may more rapidly 
	drive especially small reproductively isolated populations to diverge 
	rapidly away from the parent population.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>Some Reasons Speciation Might Not Occur</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">For some of the very same reasons discussed above, 
	very small populations are also more likely to produce changes which 
	actually <i>increase their chances of extinction.</i>The appearance of 
	radically new features of anatomy, development, or behavior in a tiny 
	population whose environment presents no dramatically altered &quot;challenges&quot; 
	can easily make it impossible for individuals of that small population to 
	continue to survive and produce descendants. In fact, many people think that 
	small, reproductively isolated off-shoot populations are, on average, more 
	likely than not to go <i>extinct </i>relatively quickly in <i>most </i>
	circumstances, rather than continuing to evolve in new directions-- 
	especially if they are not encountering environmental changes in relation to 
	which some quirky new features might actually constitute a brand new 
	selective advantage.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is also common in nature for reproductive 
	isolation (a necessary condition for speciation) to get <i>reversed.</i>This 
	can happen when a population which has been <i>temporarily </i>
	reproductively isolated from a parent population (perhaps by some temporary 
	physical barrier) ends up <i>rejoining </i>the parent population before 
	there has been a sufficient period of separation for full speciation to take 
	place. In fact, this happens <i>a lot </i>in real life, which is one reason 
	it is rare to get a chance to observe <i>full </i>speciation taking place 
	from start to finish in the framework of a human lifetime.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>What Evolutionary Biologists Argue About and What This Does and Doesn't 
	Mean</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Biologists are constantly expanding their 
	understanding of the overall process of speciation and of the kinds of 
	factors which contribute to making speciation more or less likely (and more 
	or less frequent) in different periods, conditions and environments. So 
	evolutionary biologists are naturally always debating such things as whether 
	certain factors are, or are not, likely to affect the pacing and rhythm of 
	evolutionary change in different plant and animal lines; or whether major 
	evolutionary turning points in the history of life always come about only as 
	a result of a very gradual accumulation of microevolutionary modifications, 
	or whether large-scale evolutionary trends are more typically characterized 
	(as has been suggested by Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould in their 
	theory of &quot;punctuated equilibria&quot;) by long periods of <i>relative stasis </i>
	(during which many species and evolutionary lines change mainly in minor 
	ways), separated (or &quot;punctuated&quot;) by shorter periods in which relatively 
	more rapid modifications take place through concentrated &quot;bursts&quot; of 
	speciation and overall diversification.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Evolutionary biologists today are working to bring 
	together such things as elements of our understanding of speciation 
	processes (including in especially small isolated populations) with a 
	growing realization that random external factors (such as the sudden impact 
	of a meteorite colliding with the earth 65 million years ago) may have had 
	profound effects on the overall pace and rhythm of speciation and related 
	processes throughout the history of life. Hypotheses are being proposed and 
	experiments are being designed to try to get a better handle on just what 
	mix of factors may encourage unusually high rates of speciation (as well as, 
	relatedly, unusually high rates of extinctions) at different times and under 
	different environmental conditions.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">There is still much to learn about all this. But 
	this doesn't mean, as the Creationists often try to claim, that 
	&quot;evolutionists can't even agree among themselves, so this must mean 
	evolution is wrong.&quot; First of all, as a point of basic method, even if 
	evolutionists were wrong (which is clearly not the case) this <i>still </i>
	wouldn't mean Creationists are necessarily right! More importantly, healthy 
	debate among evolutionists about &quot;cutting-edge&quot; questions in the field does 
	not mean the field itself is in disarray! The opposite is in fact the case. 
	Evolutionary biology is currently an extremely dynamic field in science in 
	large part because advances are being made <i>on the basis of a very solid, 
	comprehensive and well-proven foundational theory.</i>Once again, there is
	<i>total </i>agreement among working evolutionary biologists the world over 
	that new species have emerged (and continue to emerge) only <i>as 
	modifications of their immediately preceding ancestor species.</i>This is a 
	matter of established <i>fact </i>and general scientific consensus. It has 
	been supported not only by the fossil record and many other types of 
	indirect evidence but also by close direct observations of populations of 
	living plants and animals, which have been observed and monitored while they 
	were in the process of diverging and developing reproductive isolation 
	(again, readers of this series may recall, as just one example, the case of 
	the divergence of the Kaibab and Abert squirrels on opposite sides of the 
	Grand Canyon).</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>A Few Words About the So-Called &quot;Gaps&quot; in the Fossil Record</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Creationists like to argue that the fossil record 
	does not provide evidence for evolution because it is &quot;incomplete&quot; and &quot;full 
	of gaps,&quot; and they claim it contains no &quot;intermediate fossils&quot; which show 
	any step-wise evolutionary transitions between different life-forms. We will 
	discuss these false accusations (and the flawed methodology of the 
	Creationists) more fully in a later installment. For now, let me just say 
	that some of their &quot;accusations&quot; are just outright lies and distortions. For 
	instance, there are in fact quite a few clear sequences of fossils which 
	include intermediate forms! Some examples of this are: the well-known 
	fossils of <i>Archaeopteryx </i>(which is anatomically intermediate between 
	reptiles and birds and which has characteristics of both, such as reptilian 
	teeth and bird-like feathers); the well-preserved fossil sequences which 
	show that the ancestors of the first whales were four-legged terrestrial 
	mammals which evolved into marine mammals through a well-preserved series of 
	intermediate steps; or, ironically (since the Creationists are particularly 
	concerned to present human beings as the result of god's special Creation 
	and not descended from any other species), the fossil record of our own 
	evolution, which is particularly rich in &quot;transitional&quot; fossils, linking our 
	more ape-like and small-brained ancestors of a few million years ago to our 
	modern human species through a variety of obviously intermediate steps. (We 
	will discuss human evolution more in a future installment of this series.)</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As for the claim that the fossil record is 
	incomplete: of course it is &quot;incomplete&quot;! For one thing, only a small 
	percentage of plants and animals ever get preserved as fossils in the first 
	place. But that doesn't mean that there aren't plenty enough fossils (and 
	more are found every day) for the vast majority of scientists to feel 
	extremely confident about the basic time progressions and 
	ancestor-descendant sequences linking all the various evolutionary lineages. 
	And, as for those &quot;gaps&quot; between species: yes, there <i>are </i>some gaps 
	between species in the fossil record, but this doesn't represent a &quot;problem&quot; 
	for the theory of evolution as the Creationists would like to make people 
	believe. The Creationists have a reactionary social and political agenda, 
	based in religious fundamentalism, that they are seeking to impose on 
	people, so they often misrepresent what things like gaps in the fossil 
	record actually <i>mean </i>(and the facts be damned!). Many critics of 
	Creationist methods have pointed out that every time someone finds a new 
	intermediate fossil which actually fills a gap between two fossil species, 
	the Creationists act as if all this means is that there are now <i>two </i>
	additional <i>new </i>gaps in the fossil record, one on either side of the 
	new fossil species! (At this rate they'll keep complaining about &quot;gaps&quot; 
	forever, no matter how many gap-filling fossils are found!)</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, leaving aside the Creationist 
	lunacy, it is a fact that the theory of evolution actually <i>predicts </i>
	that there would likely continue to be significant &quot;gaps&quot; in series of 
	fossils, because of the conditions under which new species are thought to 
	emerge in the first place. Paleontologists and other fossil collectors have 
	often noticed that fossils of new species never before encountered often 
	seem to appear rather &quot;suddenly&quot; in a geological layer. But this is what you 
	would expect to find if new species do in fact evolve out of relatively <i>
	small </i>numbers of individuals which have somehow become reproductively 
	isolated from a larger population (as seems often to be the case in <i>
	living </i>species). If this is how new species typically evolve, we should 
	expect the fossil record to appear to exhibit many &quot;gaps&quot; and 
	discontinuities, not just because of the obvious fact that most individual 
	organisms decay completely and never get preserved as fossils in the first 
	place, but <i>also </i>because many (and perhaps most) initial speciation 
	events of past periods likely occurred <i>in small pockets of only a handful 
	of isolated individuals.</i>This in itself would make it highly unlikely 
	that any of the &quot;original&quot; members of a new species would <i>ever </i>be 
	found by fossil collectors.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">And again, if emerging species manage to avoid going 
	extinct almost as soon as they emerge, they are likely to interact with 
	their environments in some brand new ways that are unique to them, and this 
	in turn may allow them to expand rapidly, radiate out in new directions, and 
	even to rapidly produce additional substantial evolutionary modifications 
	(and <i>further </i>diversify into more species) in the process of adapting 
	to new environmental challenges. When we look at the fossil record, we can't 
	see the <i>exact </i>moment in time at which a new lineage first diverged 
	from an ancestor lineage; what we more typically find is evidence of what 
	looks like a relatively sudden appearance of large numbers of new organisms 
	never previously encountered, but whose preserved forms nevertheless show 
	clear signs of being <i>related </i>to the members of an earlier line. This 
	is what you would <i>expect </i>to find if speciation events typically start 
	off in small isolated populations containing only relatively small numbers 
	of individuals, and if it then takes time for populations of a new species 
	to build up their numbers and perhaps &quot;settle down,&quot; so to speak, as a 
	distinct species (maintaining themselves for an extended period of time) in 
	relation to their new environments. It is reasonable to expect that we would 
	start finding their distinct fossils only after such a process has had a 
	chance to unfold for some time.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Given this, it is all the more amazing that the 
	fossil record is actually as good as it is!</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>Not All Evolutionary Lines Evolve at the Same Rate</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">There do seem to have been times and environmental 
	conditions in the past which were particularly favorable for lots of 
	speciations and a great deal of overall species diversification to take 
	place, even in relatively brief and concentrated periods of time. Other 
	periods and environmental conditions seem to have been more characterized by 
	a sort of general maintenance of the status quo in many species and 
	lineages: but even then, populations would have been evolving in more minor 
	ways (through ongoing natural selection and related phenomena) in a constant 
	dynamic interaction with their local environments. <i>How much or how little 
	speciation takes place </i>(within a particular lineage of plant or animal 
	species, and in general among all lineages characterizing the plant and 
	animal life of a particular period in earth's history) seems to vary in 
	relation to factors and conditions that are not yet very well understood. As 
	yet, no one quite understands why some entire lineages remain largely 
	unchanged for millions of years while other lineages change frequently and 
	rapidly. Or exactly why (as can be deduced from the relative diversity of 
	fossils found in different rock layers), some geological eras were 
	characterized by tremendous &quot;explosions&quot; of species diversification, while 
	others were not.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Fossil ancestors of modern sea turtles can be found 
	in rock layers dating back 100 million years (before the time of the 
	dinosaurs) but, anatomically at least, they seem almost identical to the 
	sea-turtles which swim in today's oceans. How can they have changed so 
	little in 100 million years? The same question can be posed about other 
	lineages of so-called &quot;living fossils,&quot; including the horseshoe crabs and 
	ginkgo trees, which also seem to have hardly changed in hundreds of millions 
	of years. On the other hand, there is also the opposite situation: there are 
	currently about <i>400</i> distinct species of cichlids (a kind of fish) in 
	just one Lake in Africa (Lake Victoria). They are all related to each other 
	and are obviously descended from a single ancestor species. The truly 
	amazing thing is that we know from the geological record that the lake was 
	dry 12,000 years ago, so all this incredible amount of evolutionary 
	diversification from a common ancestor--<i> all </i>these repeated 
	speciations--had to have taken place in <i>no more </i>than 12,000 years, 
	which is like a blink of the eye on the geological time scale! So, on the 
	one hand, you have some sea turtles that barely changed at all in 100 
	million years; and, on the other hand, you have some fish which splintered 
	off into <i>hundreds </i>of different species in only 12,000 years!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Exactly why some lineages of plants or animals have 
	tended to evolve and diversify more frequently and dramatically than others 
	over the course of history is one of the more interesting questions being 
	explored by modern evolutionary biologists. As we discussed earlier, it may 
	be that some species and whole lineages are more rigidly &quot;constrained&quot; 
	(restricted) genetically and developmentally by past evolutionary 
	modifications than others; if so, they may be more likely to maintain 
	themselves pretty much &quot;as is&quot; (or simply go extinct) than to accumulate 
	really significant modifications over time. This could explain some of the 
	features of so-called &quot;living fossils.&quot; But it is also important to remember 
	that populations of living organisms don't evolve in a vacuum: they exist in 
	a constant state of dynamic interaction with features of their particular 
	local habitats and environments, which include not only <i>physical features
	</i>like climate and terrain but also <i>&quot;biotic&quot; (living) features,</i> 
	such as the other living plants and animals they may be encountering as 
	competitors or as predators. Many evolutionary biologists suspect that the 
	rhythm and pacing of overall larger-scale evolutionary trends (including the 
	rate at which new speciation events take place) may depend to a great extent 
	on how often and to what extent evolving populations may be encountering 
	significantly new environmental &quot;challenges&quot; and habitat &quot;disruptions.&quot;</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">We know from direct experience that, in living 
	species, changing environmental conditions can exert strong new selection 
	pressures on populations of organisms, both on a large scale (for example, 
	if there is a change in global climate, or an entire ecosystem is being 
	disrupted) and on a small scale (as when an ecosystem remains relatively 
	stable but a change in just one environmental variable--such as the 
	introduction into the area of a new predator species--exerts a powerful new 
	selective pressure on populations of even just one species in a local area). 
	It seems pretty clear that some lines are driven to rapidly evolve <i>
	repeated </i>modifications in relation to repeated changes in external 
	environmental pressures. This is often seen in the back-and-forth 
	co-evolution of a predator and a prey species, sometimes referred to as a 
	biological &quot;arms race&quot;--over time, the predator species keeps evolving new 
	ways of going after its prey, and the prey species keeps evolving new ways 
	of escaping its predator. It also seems clear from living species that 
	evolutionary modifications can definitely affect the way a species interacts 
	with its environment, including by enabling species to tap into previously 
	unexploited resources and previously unoccupied habitats.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>There Are No Guarantees in Evolution</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is a fact, however, that not all new 
	environmental challenges or opportunities can necessarily be &quot;met&quot; (so to 
	speak) by an evolving species. It really depends on what kind of genetic 
	variation in inheritable characteristics happens to be available within a 
	species at a given time. There are never any guarantees that reproductively 
	&quot;advantageous&quot; features will emerge among individuals in a population in the 
	first place, regardless of how strongly natural selection might favor such 
	features <i>if </i>they happened to emerge.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As discussed in the last installment, natural 
	selection itself involves an interplay of both random and non-random 
	factors: first of all, <i>random </i>(&quot;chance&quot;) factors such as mutations, 
	recombinations and genetic drift, lead to a continual re-shuffling of the 
	deck of cards which makes up the total genetic variation in a population and 
	which serves as the raw material of evolutionary change; but then, on the 
	basis of that randomly produced variation, natural selection proceeds to 
	very much <i>non- randomly </i>sort out some of the resulting features of 
	organisms <i>in relation to </i>the demands and challenges of a given 
	external environment.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">But, again, there is never any guarantee that a 
	species will evolve a particular feature which might allow it to meet a new 
	environmental pressure or challenge. Some degree of evolutionary change is 
	always going on in all living populations, but the options for <i>which </i>
	specific modifications can take place at any given time are severely <i>
	limited, </i>both by chance events and by the constraining effects of <i>
	past </i>evolutionary modifications. Sometimes a population is able to 
	evolve and keep pace with transformations of the outside world, and 
	sometimes it is not able to do so. Small-scale extinctions of individual 
	species (also known as &quot;background extinctions&quot;), as well the phenomenon of 
	entire plant or animal evolutionary lines running into evolutionary 
	&quot;dead-ends,&quot; are as much part and parcel of the history of life as the birth 
	of new species and lineages.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>The Effects of Mass Extinctions</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">As discussed previously in this series, the fossil 
	record reveals that, so far in the history of the planet, there have been at 
	least <i>five waves of &quot;mass extinctions&quot; </i>of a large proportion of all 
	the living plant and animal species. The most famous of these mass 
	extinctions occurred about 65 million years ago and seems to have been 
	caused by the impact of a large meteorite which smashed into the planet at a 
	speed of hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. The large impact crater 
	which resulted from this collision can still be seen today on the Yucatan 
	Peninsula of Mexico, and bands of the mineral iridium (which is commonly 
	found in meteorites) can be found in 65-million-year-old rock layers all 
	around the planet.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is estimated that this powerful meteorite impact 
	would have sent up such huge amounts of dirt and debris into the atmosphere 
	that it likely would have blocked sunlight and dropped temperatures all 
	around the globe to such an extent that much of the sunshine-dependent plant 
	life would have been rapidly killed off. This in turn would have led, in a 
	chain-reaction, to the deaths of most of the animals dependent on plants for 
	food and many of their predators. In fact, it can be seen in the fossil 
	record that all the plant- eating dinosaurs and their meat-eating predators 
	became extinct 65 million years ago, most likely in relation to this 
	catastrophic event.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">It is very unlikely that any dinosaur species could 
	have evolved new features rapidly enough to allow them to avoid extinction 
	in the face of such a devastating and sudden event. But for those animal 
	species that did happen to survive (including the ancestors of modern-day 
	mammals which, 65 million years ago, were just small shrew or mouse-like 
	creatures, who may have escaped sudden extinction because they were 
	nocturnal and lived in burrows), the elimination of many of the ecologically
	<i>dominant </i>species of the era (including the dinosaurs) may well have 
	created an environmental &quot;opening&quot; and opportunity into which any surviving 
	species might be able to rapidly expand and further diversify. In fact, 
	there are clear indications that the geological period following the mass 
	extinction event of 65 million years ago saw a tremendous burst in 
	diversification of mammal species.</font></p>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>
	<p>Speciation Before Our Eyes?</p>
	</b></font>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In most cases, speciations take too long (too many 
	generations) for human beings to witness the full process from beginning to 
	end. But there are some cases (especially in plants and in fast- reproducing 
	species) where it has been possible to directly observe speciation as it was 
	happening.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">For instance, many years ago the great geneticist 
	Theodosius Dobzhansky experimentally demonstrated how speciation can occur 
	in fruit flies: in one of many lab experiments, he took one species of fruit 
	fly and divided it into two separate populations and then proceeded to 
	artificially &quot;select&quot; for different characteristics (like the number of 
	bristles on their legs) in the two populations over successive generations. 
	After 20 or so generations, he put the two populations of flies back 
	together in the same place but found that the individuals of the two 
	populations could no longer interbreed--they had accumulated enough 
	underlying genetic differences (through Dobzhansky's manipulations 
	&quot;favoring&quot; just one or two apparently superficial features) that the flies 
	in the two different populations could no longer mate with each other--they 
	had effectively become different species! </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Another experiment involved taking a wild, natural 
	population of fruit flies collected in a tropical forest and simply dividing 
	it up into two equal groups, which were then kept and allowed to reproduce 
	in separate tanks for a period of five years without interfering with them 
	in any way: at the end of that time (plenty of time for fruit flies in each 
	group to separately produce a great many generations!), the two populations 
	were reunited--but here again it was found that they had lost their ability 
	to interbreed. The <i>genetic differences which had been accumulating 
	separately </i>for five years had rendered the two populations <i>
	reproductively incompatible;</i>observations of their anatomical 
	differences, changed behaviors, and differences in their underlying DNA 
	revealed how much they had diverged - they really had become two separate 
	species.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Why then aren't we always finding brand new species 
	of plants and animals emerging in the natural world everywhere we look? 
	There are a number of reasons for this. One of the most obvious reasons is 
	that most species just don't produce series of new generations as fast as 
	things like fruit flies or bacteria, and it takes many generations for <i>
	enough </i>distinct genetic variation to accumulate in a population to even 
	have a chance of turning it into a distinct species. People can observe many 
	fruit fly generations over a few months or years, but think about how much 
	time it would take (relative to an average human lifespan) to observe 
	changes taking place over 20 or 30 generations in most mammal species, for 
	instance! Most major evolutionary changes take place over at least thousands 
	of generations, so people living today are much more likely to witness the 
	total extinction of a species (which we unfortunately witness all too 
	frequently these days) than the emergence of a brand new species which has 
	never before existed.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Also, in the real world it is not so easy for 
	conditions of <i>absolute </i>reproductive isolation to be maintained 
	between populations of a species <i>for a long enough period of time </i>for 
	full speciation to take place. Populations in nature which have been kept 
	apart for a while by some physical barrier (a dry channel, a sandbar, a 
	logging swath cut through a forest, and so forth) often recombine when the 
	physical barrier breaks down-- a blocked channel between two lakes may 
	reopen, for instance, allowing previously separated fish populations of the 
	same species to once again interbreed. This has the effect of <i>
	interrupting </i>the speciation process which had only just begun. Keep in 
	mind also that it is not enough for new features to &quot;emerge&quot; in a relatively 
	reproductively isolated population -- evolutionary &quot;novelties&quot; may well <i>
	emerge </i>in such a population, and may even confer some reproductive 
	advantages on the individuals which have these novel features, but even that 
	is not a guarantee that the change will get <i>preserved and consolidated
	</i>in the population <i>as a whole </i>--lots of &quot;accidental&quot; processes can 
	intervene to prevent this &quot;consolidation&quot; of novelty, such as the sudden 
	introduction into an area of a new predator or competitor species; the 
	impact of a factor leading to dramatic climate changes; the effects on a 
	local physical environment of such things as wildfires or floods, etc. Any 
	such factors can easily lead to particular individuals or even entire 
	populations getting wiped out long before any advantageous novelty has had a 
	chance to spread to enough descendants to make it likely that it will be 
	preserved. Especially in the case of a really small population, it can be a 
	real crapshoot whether it hangs in there long enough for any potentially 
	unique evolutionary innovations to get an evolutionary toe-hold.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Despite factors which can prevent the speciation 
	process from getting completed in any given instance, or cause a newly 
	emerged species to peter out, full speciation has nevertheless occurred 
	innumerable times over the past 3 and a half billion years and it is an 
	ongoing process. It is what explains the truly amazing diversity of past and 
	present life-forms on this planet--a diversity which is all the more 
	wonderful in that it has flowered and unfolded on its own, without the 
	involvement of any imaginary outside &quot;engineer&quot; or super-natural &quot;designer.&quot;</font></p>
	<sup>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><a name="foot1">1</a></font></sup><font face="Verdana"> 
	Sometimes the mechanism of reproductive isolation seems even more subtle but 
	just as effective: for instance, studies have shown that some populations of 
	closely related insects can become reproductively separated simply as a 
	result of feeding on different species of neighboring plants; and new plant 
	species have been observed to emerge when two related but distinct plant 
	species, which occupy the same habitat but which are normally reproductively 
	isolated due to genetic factors (such as chromosomal incompatibilities), 
	cross and produce sterile hybrids. Normally, such hybrids, like the sterile 
	mules, would not be able to produce any descendants; however, in plants it 
	seems that it is not all that rare for the chromosomes of such sterile 
	hybrids to spontaneously <i>double </i>(a phenomenon known as<i> polyploidy
	</i>), which essentially has the effect of restoring these hybrids' ability 
	to produce descendants--though they are now effectively members of a new 
	species! It is thought that a great many of the 260,000 or so species of 
	living plants evolved as distinct modifications of ancestor species through 
	such instances of polyploidy. <i><a href="#back1">(back to text)</a></i></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><sup><a name="foot2">2</a></sup> It is important to 
	realize that changes in the gene frequencies and overall genetic diversity 
	of populations can come about as a result of chance events, and not just as 
	a result of natural selection operating on that population. For instance, 
	new individuals may just happen to migrate into an area, introducing <i>
	additional </i>genetic material into a population or, conversely, the 
	overall genetic diversity of a population can be <i>reduced </i>by genetic 
	drift, when specific genetic alleles (variants of genes) are lost from a 
	population simply due to the accidental deaths of individuals or the 
	accidental wipe- out of even a whole section of the population. <i>
	<a href="#back2">(back to text)</a></i></font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana"><sup><a name="foot3">3</a></sup>There is some 
	experimental evidence to support this view, and it is thought by many that 
	the more limited amount of total genetic variation in the smaller population 
	at the very onset of speciation may actually contribute to a &quot;relaxing&quot; of 
	some genetically encoded developmental constraints (limiting factors) 
	present in the genetically more complex larger population, and that such a 
	&quot;relaxing&quot; of developmental constraints may facilitate genetic reshufflings 
	that can lead to the emergence of brand new features. <i><a href="#back3">
