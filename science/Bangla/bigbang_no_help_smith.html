				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the mid-1960s, 
				scientifically informed theists have been ecstatic because of 
				Big Bang cosmology. Theists believe that the best scientific 
				evidence that God exists is the evidence that the universe began 
				to exist in an explosion about 15 billion years ago, an 
				explosion called the Big Bang. Theists think it obvious that the 
				universe could not have begun to exist uncaused. They argue that 
				the most reasonable hypothesis is that the cause of the universe 
				is God. This theory hinges on the assumption that it is 
				obviously true that whatever begins to exist has a cause. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most recent 
				statement of this theist theory is in William Lane Craig's 1994 
				book <cite>Reasonable Faith</cite>.<a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/../../smith_18_2.html#foot1">[1]</a> 
				In it Craig states his argument like this: </font></p>
				<ol>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whatever begins to 
					exist has a cause. </font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The universe began 
					to exist. </font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, the 
					universe has a cause.<a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/../../smith_18_2.html#foot2">[2]</a></font></li>
				</ol>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a very interesting 
				quote from this book he discusses the first premise and mentions 
				me as one of the perverse atheists who deny the obviousness of 
				this assumption: </font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first step is so 
					intuitively obvious that I think scarcely anyone could 
					sincerely believe it to be false. I therefore think it 
					somewhat unwise to argue in favor of it, for any proof of 
					the principle is likely to be less obvious than the 
					principle itself. And as Aristotle remarked, one ought not 
					to try to prove the obvious via the less obvious. The old 
					axiom that &quot;out of nothing, nothing comes&quot; remains as 
					obvious today as ever. When I first wrote <cite>The Kalam 
					Cosmological Argument</cite>, I remarked that I found it an 
					attractive feature of this argument that it allows the 
					atheist a way of escape: he can always deny the first 
					premise and assert the universe sprang into existence 
					uncaused out of nothing. I figured that few would take this 
					option, since I believed they would thereby expose 
					themselves as persons interested only in academic refutation 
					of the argument and not in really discovering the truth 
					about the universe. To my surprise, however, atheists seem 
					to be increasingly taking this route. For example, Quentin 
					Smith, commenting that philosophers are too often adversely 
					affected by Heidegger's dread of &quot;the nothing,&quot; concludes 
					that &quot;the most reasonable belief is that we came from 
					nothing, by nothing, and for nothing&quot; - a nice ending to a 
					sort of Gettysburg address of atheism, perhaps.<a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/../../smith_18_2.html#foot3">[3]</a></font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A Baseless Assumption
				</font></h2>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I'm going to criticize 
				this argument from scientific cosmology, which is the most 
				popular argument that scientifically informed theists and 
				philosophers are now using to argue that God exists. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let's consider the first 
				premise of the argument, that whatever has a beginning to its 
				existence must have a cause. What reason is there to believe 
				this causal principle is true? It's not self-evident; something 
				is self-evident if and only if everyone who understands it 
				automatically believes it. But many people, including leading 
				theists such as Richard Swinburne, understand this principle 
				very well but think it is false. Many philosophers, scientists, 
				and indeed the majority of graduate and undergraduate students 
				I've had in my classes think this principle is false. This 
				principle is not self-evident, nor can this principle be deduced 
				from any self-evident proposition. Therefore, there's no reason 
				to think it's true. It is either false or it has the status of a 
				statement that we do not know is true or false. At the very 
				least, it is clear that we do not know that it is true. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now suppose the theist 
				retreats to a weaker version of this principle and says, 
				&quot;Whatever has a beginning to its existence has a cause.&quot; Now, 
				this does not say that whatever has a beginning to its existence
				<em>must</em> have a cause; it allows that it is possible that 
				some things begin to exist without a cause. So we don't need to 
				consider it as a self-evident, necessary truth. Rather, 
				according to the theists, we can consider it to be an empirical 
				generalization based on observation. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But there is a decisive 
				problem with this line of thinking. There is absolutely no 
				evidence that it is true. All of the observations we have are of 
				changes in things - of something changing from one state to 
				another. Things move, come to a rest, get larger, get smaller, 
				combine with other things, divide in half, and so on. But we 
				have no observation of things coming into existence. For 
				example, we have no observations of people coming into 
				existence. Here again, you merely have a change of things. An 
				egg cell and a sperm cell change their state by combining. The 
				combination divides, enlarges, and eventually evolves into an 
				adult human being. Therefore, I conclude that we have no 
				evidence at all that the empirical version of Craig's statement, 
				&quot;Whatever begins to exist has a `cause',&quot; is true. All of the 
				causes we are aware of are changes in pre-existing materials. In 
				Craig's and other theists' causal principle, &quot;cause&quot; means 
				something entirely different: it means creating material from 
				nothingness. It is pure speculation that such a strange sort of 
				causation is even possible, let alone even supported in our 
				observations in our daily lives. </font></p>
				<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An Uncaused Universe
				</font></h2>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the more important 
				point is this: not only is there no evidence for the theist's 
				causal assumption, there's evidence against it. The claim that 
				the beginning of our universe has a cause conflicts with current 
				scientific theory. The scientific theory is called the Wave 
				Function of the Universe. It has been developed in the past 15 
				years or so by Stephen Hawking, Alex Vilenkin, Andre Linde, and 
				many others. Their theory is that there is a scientific law of 
				nature called the Wave Function of the Universe that implies 
				that it is <em>highly probable</em> that a universe with our 
				characteristics will come into existence without a cause. 
				Hawking's theory is based on assigning numbers to all possible 
				universes. All of the numbers cancel out except for a universe 
				with features that our universe possesses, such as containing 
				intelligent organisms. This remaining universe has a very high 
				probability - near 100% - of coming into existence uncaused.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hawking's theory is 
				confirmed by observational evidence. The theory predicts that 
				our universe has evenly distributed matter on a large scale - 
				that is, on the level of super-clusters of galaxies. It predicts 
				that the expansion rate of our universe - our universe has been 
				expanding ever since the Big Bang - would be almost exactly 
				between the rate of the universe expanding forever and the rate 
				where it expands and then collapses. It also predicts the very 
				early area of rapid expansion near the beginning of the universe 
				called &quot;inflation.&quot; Hawking's theory exactly predicted what the 
				COBE satellite discovered about the irregularities of the 
				background radiation in the universe.<a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/../../smith_18_2.html#foot4">[4]</a>
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So scientific theory 
				that is confirmed by observational evidence tells us that the 
				universe began without being caused. If you want to be a 
				rational person and accept the results of rational inquiry into 
				nature, then you must accept the fact that God did not cause the 
				universe to exist. The universe exists uncaused, in accordance 
				with the Wave Function law. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now Stephen Hawking's 
				theory dissolves any worries about how the universe could begin 
				to exist uncaused. He supposes that there is a timeless space, a 
				four-dimensional hypersphere, near the beginning of the 
				universe. It is smaller than the nucleus of an atom. It is 
				smaller than 10 centimeters in radius. Since it was timeless, it 
				no more needs a cause than the timeless god of theism. This 
				timeless hypersphere is connected to our expanding universe. Our 
				universe begins smaller than an atom and explodes in a Big Bang, 
				and here we are today in a universe that is still expanding.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is it nonetheless 
				possible that God could have caused this universe? No. For the 
				Wave Function of the Universe implies that there is a 95% 
				probability that the universe came into existence uncaused. If 
				God created the universe, he would contradict this scientific 
				law in two ways. First, the scientific law says that the 
				universe would come into existence because of its natural, 
				mathematical properties, not because of any supernatural forces. 
				Second, the scientific law says that the probability is only 95% 
				that the universe would come into existence. But if God created 
				the universe, the probability would be 100% that it would come 
				into existence because God is allpowerful. If God wills the 
				universe to come into existence, his will is guaranteed to be 
				100% effective. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So contemporary 
				scientific cosmology is not only not supported by any theistic 
				theory, it is actually logically inconsistent with theism.
