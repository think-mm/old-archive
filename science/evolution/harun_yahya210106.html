	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Harun Yahya&quot; (the pen name of Adnan 
	Oktar) is the name of a popular proponent of Islamic apologetics, born in 
	1956, whose books and articles are said to receive wide publication in 
	Turkey and other Islamic countries. He also claims himself to be an 
	intellectual hero against neo-Darwinism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His 180 books include such 
	enlightening tomes as &quot;Allah is Known Through Reason&quot;, &quot;The Design in 
	Nature&quot;, &quot;The Other Name for Illusion: Matter&quot;, &quot;The Collapse of the Theory 
	of Evolution&quot;, &quot;Disasters Darwinism Brought to Humanity&quot;, and &quot;The Qur'an 
	Leads the Way to Science&quot;. Some others look more like Chick tracts, with 
	names like &quot;Crude Understanding Of Disbelief&quot;, &quot;Solution: The Values of the 
	Qur'an&quot;, &quot;Jesus Will Return&quot; and &quot;Romanticism: A Weapon of Satan&quot; (!).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Because of his popularity and body 
	of work, we should be interested in examining more carefully his web site, 
	called <a href="http://www.hyahya.org/">Harun Yahya: an Invitation to Truth</a>. 
	The full texts of some of his books are also available.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I myself have a web site about 
	philosophy, and try to be as lenient as possible: unfortunately, the front 
	page of the site (as I see it in June 2002, anyway) does not inspire 
	confidence. While it is professionally-made, it includes an ironic 
	placement: the header &quot;The True Islamic Morals&quot;, telling us how Islam leads 
	to love and justice, side-by-side with &quot;Perished Nations&quot;, telling us that 
	Allah destroyed ancient nations because they rebelled against him. It also 
	includes such titles as &quot;The Fact of Creation&quot; and &quot;Fascism: the Bloody 
	Ideology of Darwinism&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such contradiction and absurdity may 
	be superficial assessment on my part, but does not reflect well on what 
	Yahya sees as important issues: it implies that the contents of his web site 
	are inane and anti-scientific.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. Articles on Faith &amp; Wisdom</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His articles are divided into three 
	sections: &quot;Articles on Faith &amp; Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Articles on Science &amp; Faith&quot; and 
	&quot;Articles on Social Issues&quot;. The articles are sprinkled with Qur'an verses 
	and praises to Allah, and this makes the content, once again, very 
	uninspiring. Most of the articles in this first section consist of two 
	maneuvers: praising Allah for creating everything, and the argument from 
	design.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his books and articles, Yahya 
	seems inordinately fond of the simple version of the argument from design 
	(that is, descriptions of complex entities and systems, followed by the 
	assumption that they must have been created). It seems his Turkish audience 
	is very unrefined in theological matters: at least here in North America we 
	have people like Behe and Dembski to attempt to spice it up for us. While 
	the latter also fail miserably, the process of refuting them is more 
	challenging than refuting Yahya.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This robotic transcription of facts, 
	as if they represented some kind of higher truth, is lengthy and unfruitful. 
	An example: &quot;The solar system revolves around the centre of the galaxy at 
	720,000 km an hour. The velocity of the Milky Way itself, comprising some 
	200 billion stars, is 950,000 km an hour. This continual movement is 
	inconceivable. The earth, together with the solar system, each year moves 
	500 million kilometres away from its location of the previous year&quot;. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is this, and other facts about 
	the galaxy, supposed to prove? That &quot;the universe we live in is created by a 
	Creator, whose existence and attributes are revealed in everything that 
	exists&quot;. But such expositions of facts do not show us a Creator, and neither 
	do they make obvious the necessity of a Creator: they only show us the 
	majesty of natural law. The burden of proof is on the religious apologist: 
	he must demonstrate that natural law is impotent in explaining a 
	particularity of nature.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yahya also finds it necessary to 
	constantly praise Allah for his supposed creation. For example, in &quot;Basic 
	Questions of our Lives&quot;, we learn that sociology is impossible without 
	belief in Allah:<br>
	&quot;Essentially, the existence of Allah and the reality that there is no deity 
	other than Allah are crystal clear facts. But in 'the society of ignorance' 
	where people fail to use their reasoning due to their habit of indifference 
	and indolence, they grow blind and cannot comprehend this reality. As a 
	matter of fact, that is the reason why they were stigmatized as a 'society 
	of ignorance'&quot;.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The entire section is filled with 
	rhetorics of this nature, and therefore I will not pick them apart 
	individually. I will, however, discuss one point raised which is 
	particularily laughable in its absurdity. While the author discusses, in the 
	same article, the &quot;miracle&quot; of childbirth, he quotes the book of 
	Al-Mumenoon, which says:<br>
	&quot;Man We did create from a quintessence (of clay); Then We placed him as (a 
	drop of) sperm in a place of rest, firmly fixed; Then We made the sperm into 
	a clot of congealed blood; then of that clot We made a (foetus) lump; then 
	we made out of that lump bones and clothed the bones with flesh; then we 
	developed out of it another creature. So blessed be Allah, the best to 
	create!&quot; (23:12-14)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Anyone who thinks this is a good 
	explanation of how Allah creates a foetus must be illiterate. The foetus is 
	not made of clay, neither is the sperm transformed into congealed blood, or 
	developed into another creature. Bone development depends on bone-producing 
	cells - flesh. Bones in the human foetus do not begin to form until the 40th 
	day (Cell and Molecular Biology of Vertebrate Hard Tissues, Caplan and 
	Pechak, 1988). This is all basic embryology which would be available even to 
	desert dwellers of the time, let alone Allah.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The verses I have quoted are, I 
	assure you, a staple of Islamic apologetics. That they use such an absurdity 
	in a widespread manner shows how little science there is in the Qur'an.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Furthermore, other statements in 
	this article, which imply that Allah creates every foetus individually, 
	betray an ignorance of modern biology. His college education in &quot;Mimar Sinan 
	University's Academy of Fine Arts&quot; may be a problem to his understanding of 
	science, which is limited to regurgitation.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In &quot;Never Plead Ignorance that Quran 
	is the Just Book&quot;, the book of Yunus is invoked:<br>
	&quot;This Qur'an is not such as can be produced by other than Allah; on the 
	contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a 
	fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord 
	of the worlds. Or do they say, 'He forged it'? say: 'Bring then a Sura like 
	unto it, and call (to your aid) anyone you can besides Allah, if it be ye 
	speak the truth!'&quot; (10:37-38)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems that Yahya does not know 
	that many Christians have indeed made suras like it, and succeeded. The 
	biggest web site about these made-up suras was attacked by Internet Islamic 
	fanatics, but an archive of four such suras is still
	<a href="http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/suralikeit/original/index.shtml">
	available</a>.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is no need to continue 
	indulging this nonsense. My conclusion is that these articles exhibit an 
	abundant amount of faith, but virtually no wisdom.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Articles on Science &amp; Faith
	</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fortunately for the reader's sanity, 
	the articles on science are less spasmically religious and more serious. 
	Unfortunately, they also fully display Yahya's basic scientific ignorance. 
	His numerous arguments are dispersed in the various articles in this 
	section, so I will make a list of those that pertain to evolution, Yahya's 
	pet subject:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. Darwinism is based on chance 
	(&quot;Darwinism's Contradiction With Religion&quot;)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Punctuated Equilibrum says that 
	jumps in evolution are possible, like birds popping out of reptile eggs, 
	instead of the gradualism of neo-Darwinism. It was made to cover up the 
	&quot;fossil fiasco&quot; (&quot;The Evolution Deceit&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. All living creatures are designed 
	and ordered, and therefore were created (&quot;The Design in Nature&quot;, &quot;The Signs 
	in the Heavens and on the Earth&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4. Darwinism disrupts the natural 
	harmony of science and religion, proof that it is false (&quot;Scientists Confirm 
	the Signs of God&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5. Instincts do not exist: rather, 
	all animal behavior is inspired by Allah (&quot;Self-Sacrifice in Animals&quot;, 
	&quot;Spiders' Fishing Techniques&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6. No beneficial mutations have ever 
	existed (&quot;The Design in Nature&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">7. Vestigial organs do not exist 
	(&quot;Yet Another Blow to the Myth of Vestigial Organs&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">8. &quot;Laboratory experiments and 
	probabilistic calculations have definitely made it clear that the proteins 
	from which life arises cannot have been formed by chance&quot; (&quot;The Evolution 
	Deceit&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">9. Cells, DNA, and the information 
	in DNA, cannot come to exist by chance (&quot;The Evolution Deceit&quot;, &quot;The Miracle 
	of Design in the Cell&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">10. No transitional forms have ever 
	been found. Each species was created by Allah - in scientific terms, this is 
	called Special Creationism (&quot;The Fossil Record Refutes Evolution&quot;, &quot;The 
	Evolution Deceit&quot;, &quot;Darwinism's Contradiction With Religion&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">11. The Cambrian Explosion is proof 
	that Allah created the variety of life at once (&quot;The Fossil Record Refutes 
	Evolution&quot;, &quot;The Evolution Deceit&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">12. The systems in the human body 
	are so interlocked that they cannot have evolved - this is Behe's 
	&quot;Irreducible Complexity&quot; (&quot;A System Planned in its Every Detail&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Also, some features of nature are 
	extensively described, and propped up as proof of creation, including: DNA 
	(&quot;The Evolution Deceit&quot;), the immune system (&quot;The Defense System&quot;), the bees 
	(&quot;The Honey Bee&quot;), the Earth as suportive of human life (&quot;The Earth: A 
	Living Planet&quot;, &quot;The Obvious Existence of God&quot;), the coordination of the 
	human body (&quot;Co-Ordination in Human Body&quot;), butterflies (&quot;From a Caterpillar 
	to a Butterfly&quot;), bird migration (&quot;Migration and Orientation in Animals&quot;), 
	rain (&quot;Rain by Design&quot;), water-spiders (&quot;Spiders' Fishing Techniques&quot;), 
	water (&quot;The Design in Water&quot;), ants (&quot;The Perfect Social System of Ants&quot;), 
	woodpeckers (&quot;The Design of the Woodpecker&quot;), and more. As explained before, 
	these examples prove nothing except the power of natural law, and that Yahya 
	is capable of regurgitating common science, but not of understanding it.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some of these arguments are 
	laughable and betray a fundamental ignorance of the theory of evolution, and 
	you may doubt that they are really proposed - feel free to consult the 
	articles listed besides them to get confirmation. But let me now take these 
	arguments one at a time. For the sake of space, I will discuss the arguments 
	against evolution - the cosmological arguments would require more lengthy 
	discussion, although the Big Bang argument on order is also answered in 
	point 3.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. <font size="+1">Darwinism is 
	based on chance.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This argument demonstrates that 
	Yahya, like most Creationists, has no knowledge whatsoever of what 
	biological evolution is. It is probably too much to expect for religious 
	fanatics bent on disproving a menace to their religion to actually know what 
	it is they are trying to disprove.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This bromide is not only false, but 
	doubly false. From a metaphysical point of view, &quot;chance&quot; is mostly an 
	illusion caused by our incapacity to perceive everything. For example, when 
	we say that the throw of a normal die entails a probability of 1/6 for each 
	side, what we are really saying is that we do not have the information about 
	the throw, the air, and the table necessary to say which side will come up. 
	Of course, the real probability is of 1 for one side and 0 for the others.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From a scientific point of view, 
	this claim is also false. Neo-Darwinism (which I assume here is what is 
	meant by &quot;Darwinism&quot;, perhaps in the author's confusion) is based on 
	mechanisms such as natural selection, mutations, sexual selection, genetic 
	drift, and others. None of these mechanisms are based on &quot;chance&quot;. Even 
	mutations have definite properties, dictated by genetic processes and 
	natural law: there are germ mutations, point mutations, frame-shift 
	mutations, and so on. As such, the statement that neo-Darwinism is based on 
	&quot;chance&quot; is an elementary lie.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. <font size="+1">Punctuated 
	Equilibrum says that jumps in evolution are possible, like birds popping out 
	of reptile eggs, instead of the gradualism of neo-Darwinism. It was made to 
	cover up the &quot;fossil fiasco&quot;.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Punctuated Equilibrum is a 
	hypothesis, promoted notably by Eldredge and Gould, which proposes that the 
	tempo of evolution is made of accelerated and slow periods, instead of 
	constant change. It does not cover up any &quot;fossil fiasco&quot;: in fact, it puts 
	the focus on what we observe in the fossil record. If the fossil record was 
	a fiasco, then any number of hypothesis could not cover it - the 
	hypothetical corrupt scientists in Yahya should rather have kept the problem 
	quiet than try to reconcile their theory with it.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. <font size="+1">All living 
	creatures are designed and ordered, and therefore were created.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yahya simply assumes design and 
	order, jumps to a Creator, and then jumps again to his favourite deity, 
	Allah. But all these steps are faulty. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He defines design as &quot;a harmonious 
	assembling of various parts into an orderly form towards a common goal&quot;, and 
	that this applies to animals:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Can a bird and mechanics of its 
	flying be a design as well? (...) The goal at hand, in this case, is to fly. 
	For this purpose, hollowed bones, strong muscles that move these bones are 
	utilized together with feathers capable of suspending in the air. Wings are 
	formed aerodynamically, and metabolism is in tune with the bird's need for 
	high levels of energy. It is obvious that the bird is product of a certain 
	design.&quot;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not, in fact, obvious at all. 
	His definition of design is an assumption of Creationism, nothing more. The 
	rational way to determine design is to compare the power of natural law with 
	the possible design alternatives. Since evolution explains the adaptation of 
	organisms sufficiently, there is no need to invoke design. Also, it is not 
	obvious that animals have &quot;goals&quot;, except if we again assume Creationism - a 
	goal implies a goal-giver. Order and design are in fact both staples of 
	natural law, not design.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, it is not necessary for the 
	hypothetical design to have been made by a Creator, neither is it necessary 
	for the hypothetical Creator to be Allah. This whole argument is pure 
	circularity and assumption.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4. <font size="+1">Darwinism 
	disrupts the natural harmony of science and religion, proof that it is 
	false.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is Yahya right in saying that 
	science has always been theistic, until evolution came in the picture, and 
	that it is therefore an aberration? Certainly not. While the strength of 
	religion and the relative paucity of scientific explanations made most 
	scientists of earlier times profess religion, scientific discovery has at 
	all times been opposed by religion. Science is based on reason, materialism, 
	and discovery, while religion is based on faith, supernaturalism, and the 
	occult. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Virtually all the great scientists 
	and discoveries in history until recent times - like Copernicus, Bruno, 
	Galileo, Pasteur, Darwin, and even today researchers in genetics - have 
	faced tremendous religious opposition. To claim harmony is disingenuous, and 
	to disqualify a sound theory on its basis, ridiculous.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5. <font size="+1">Instincts do not 
	exist: rather, all animal behaviour is inspired by Allah.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yahya tells us that &quot;[the] instincts 
	[of living things], which Darwin was unable to explain within the scope of 
	evolution, are actually the inspiration given by God to all living things&quot;, 
	and that &quot;God is the master and supervisor of everything and that every 
	living creature acts on His inspiration&quot;.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not only is this a lot of unncessary 
	work for a deity, but we would have to answer, what is the difference? We 
	cannot distinguish between a behaviour motivated by the brain and a 
	behaviour inspired by Allah: both produce the same tangible effects. By 
	Occam's Razor, we must therefore reject the idea that Allah is involved in 
	the production of animal behaviour.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, Yahya's example of 
	self-sacrifice (in &quot;Self-Sacrifice of Animals&quot;) is already well-explained by 
	the fact that it is genes that tend towards adaptation, not individuals. The 
	name given in evolution to this phenomenon is Hamilton's Rule - the 
	evolutionary pressure for an action is proportional to the benefits it 
	confers to the genes of the individual present in other members of his 
	family (for example, a brother or sister has in average one-half of the 
	species-specific genes in an individual). This is not a mystery or divine 
	revelation, but simple science.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6. <font size="+1">No beneficial 
	mutations have ever existed.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have Sickle Cell anemia, a 
	mutation of red blood cells that gives them a sickle shape and extra 
	hardness. This mutation is widespread in many regions, including Latin 
	America, Southern Europe, and Arab countries, and confers a greater immunity 
	to malaria. It seems that Yahya does not live in these regions, otherwise he 
	would already know about that widespread example!</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most mutations are destructive in 
	nature, but some are positive. This is enough for evolution to generate 
	adaptation in species.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">7. <font size="+1">Vestigial organs 
	do not exist.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yahya demonstrates his ignorance of 
	basic definitions again, by defining vestigial organs as &quot;non-functional 
	organs&quot;, and complaining that they &quot;[turn] out to be organs whose functions 
	had not yet been discovered&quot;, thus once again disproving evolution. But a 
	vestigial organ is only an organ with reduced functions compared to its 
	previous uses in evolutionary ancestors. The appendix used to be a part of 
	the digestive system, but now only houses some immune system cells. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">8. <font size="+1">&quot;Laboratory 
	experiments and probabilistic calculations have definitely made it clear 
	that the proteins from which life arises cannot have been formed by chance&quot;</font>.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">9. <font size="+1">Cells, DNA, and 
	the information in DNA, cannot come to exist by chance.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The probability of proteins is is a 
	common calculation amongst Creationists, which consists of calculating the 
	probability that each part of a protein somehow clicked into place by 
	chance. Yahya, fearing that his readers may not have the imagination to 
	grasp the probability involved (1 in 10^950), conveniently included the 
	complete notation of the number 1 with 950 zeros. Unfortunately for him, his 
	childish appeal to big numbers fails because evolution does not claim that 
	proteins arose by chance, but rather by a gradual process (see point 1). The 
	same is true for cells and DNA.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">10. <font size="+1">No transitional 
	forms have ever been found. Each species was created by Allah - in 
	scientific terms, this is called Special Creationism.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">11. <font size="+1">The Cambrian 
	Explosion is proof that Allah created the variety of life at once.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These two arguments are 
	contradictory. Yahya contends that &quot;[t]he fossil record clearly indicate 
	that different living species (...) appeared on earth suddenly fully formed 
	and without any preceding ancestors similar to them&quot; and that this entails 
	that &quot;God created every species individually and at one moment&quot;. Then how is 
	it possible that the Cambrian Explosion is an indication that &quot;living things 
	did not evolve from primitive to the advanced forms, but instead emerged all 
	of a sudden and in a perfect state&quot;? Either Allah created all species at 
	once during the Cambrian Explosion, or he created them individually over 
	time. Either solution contradicts the theory of evolution and the fossil 
	record, but at least Yahya should try to be internally consistent.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As it turns out, both arguments are 
	distortions by Yahya of the theory of evolution. In one sense, there is no 
	such thing as a &quot;transitional form&quot;, since we always classify a species as 
	being part of one or the other phylum: there is no &quot;official middle ground&quot; 
	simply because taxonomy doesn't work that way. The transitions between 
	species are themselves well-documented in any textbook of evolution 
	(beginners can start with chapter 22 of &quot;Vertebrate Paleontology and 
	Evolution&quot;, Carroll, 1988, or &quot;The evolution of mammalian characters&quot;, D.M. 
	and K.A. Kermack, 1984, and work their way from there).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Creationist interpretation of 
	the Cambrian Explosion is also a naive interpretation of taxonomy. Should we 
	be surprised that phyla suddently appear at a certain era? Not any more than 
	we should be astonished that the major branches of a tree start growing 
	around the same time. The so-called &quot;explosion&quot; is the consequence of our 
	classification of animals in groups and sub-groups, not of any creative 
	action.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">12. <font size="+1">The systems in 
	the human body are so interlocked that they cannot have evolved - this is 
	Behe's &quot;Irreducible Complexity&quot;.</font></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yahya's arguments here are simpler 
	than Behe's, and refuting the latter is adequate for refuting the former. I 
	therefore refer you to a document on Talk Reason
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/behe2.cfm">about Behe's 
	arguments</a>. Suffice it to say here that the argument that interlocked 
	systems cannot evolve is easily disproven by simpler forms in nature of the 
	organs or systems which Behe and Yahya consider &quot;irreducibly complex&quot;, as 
	well as by the adaptation of systems from one function to another.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The already prohibitive space I took 
	to refute these general arguments stops me from answering his cosmological 
	arguments, as well as more specific arguments against, amongst others, 
	molecular biology and the Urey-Miller experiment. It will suffice to say 
	that Yahya's track record in arguing generally against evolution does not 
	inspire confidence in his capacity to nitpick.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. Articles on Social Issues</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If the articles about science 
	betrayed Yahya's scientific ignorance, the articles about societal problems 
	betray his ethical ignorance. Their rhetoric is simplistic: faith makes for 
	a good society and good values, and faithlessness makes for a bad society 
	and bad values.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even for the uninitiated, this seems 
	as bizarre as Yahya's claims that religion has never conflicted with 
	science. The most destructive times in history were times when religion was 
	prominent. The countries and continents with the greatest concentration of 
	religious beliefs also experience the most scientific, political and 
	economical retardation (including, do we need to mention, Islamic 
	countries).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Putting aside Yahya's 
	self-righteousness evident in every article, we can list some attributes of 
	what Yahya calls &quot;ignorant societies&quot; - people who live in disbelief of 
	Allah. Without evidence, he proposes that they are to be associated with: 
	lawlessness, dishonesty, lies (&quot;Moral Degeneration&quot;), the abolishment of 
	morality and the rise of whim-worship, degeneracies like sexual perversion 
	and drug addiction, falsehood and betrayal, the abandonment of doing good 
	and self-sacrifice because our lives are finite (&quot;The Depressions of a 
	Faithless Society&quot;), Social Darwinism and racism (&quot;Superiority Comes from 
	Character, Not Blood&quot;, &quot;The Real Ideological Root of Terrorism - DARWINISM 
	AND MATERIALISM&quot;), elimination of the family, social anarchy and general 
	hatred, suicide, thievery, the end of solidarity and generosity because 
	everyone evolved from an ape (&quot;The Disasters of an Irreligious Social 
	System&quot;), war (&quot;The Pacifism of Islam&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What, then is his alternative? Fear 
	of God (&quot;Moral Degeneration&quot;), divine &quot;knowledge&quot; (&quot;In Every Age there 
	Existed an Ignorant Society&quot;), servitude and faith to God (&quot;The Depressions 
	of a Faithless Society&quot;), accountability in the hereafter (&quot;The Disasters of 
	an Irreligious Social System&quot;), to struggle against one's nature (&quot;The 
	Pacifism of Islam&quot;), peace, well-being and happiness, the end of all evil 
	acts, tolerence and freedom of speech, respect for life, modernism, 
	progress, compassion, forgiveness (&quot;The True Islamic Morals&quot;, &quot;Why an 
	Authoritarian Rule is Against Islam?&quot;).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I ask you, are these the words of a 
	rational man? Perhaps I should not ask rhetorical questions: but it seems to 
	me that to pin all the ills of mankind on lack of belief in one particular 
	deity is fanaticism pushed to the extreme. Once again, we are forced to 
	wonder what kind of people believe this extremist pablum.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While it would be unproductive to 
	examine all his propositions individually, I will examine a number of them 
	here. Let me first clear the question of Social Darwinism. Yahya uses 
	evolution, as we say in French, in all sauces: it is his hammer, and he sees 
	every problem as a nail. But even a cursory understanding of logic would let 
	him know about the Naturalistic Fallacy - that is, that associating 
	behaviours found in nature with ethical behaviour is fallacious. There is no 
	necessary relation between the behaviour of lower animals and ours, and no 
	serious philosopher would propose it. I have never heard it being used as a 
	serious argument by anyone: it is simply a non-issue.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What are the facts about the social 
	superiority of Islam? Yahya himself does not propose any such facts, but 
	asserts this superiority as a given. I have discussed at length the moral 
	inferiority of Christianity, and many of these arguments still apply here 
	(see my article
	<a href="http://www.objectivethought.com/articles/religionsdevils.html">
	Religion's Devils</a>). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Data specific to Islamic regions - 
	the Middle-East (MEC) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) - likewise show negative 
	results on two out of four variables. Violence-related death rate is highest 
	in SSA and MEC, and homicide rate and war-related death rate are highest in 
	SSA. However, suicide rates were lowest in SSA and average for MEC. In 
	reverse, established market economies, which tend to be more secular, show 
	the best results except as regards to sucide rates (data from &quot;Epidemiology 
	of violent deaths in the world&quot;, Reza, Mercy and Krug - please note that use 
	of the data is not meant as complete endorsement of the paper in question).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As it is well-known, Islamic 
	societies are based on violence, intolerence, authoritarianism. Harsh 
	treatment to women (including female genital mutilation), and severe 
	curtailing of any non-religious liberties, based on the Qur'an, is the norm. 
	Iran and Saudi Arabia are two of the five countries that contribute most to 
	capital punishment (another being the United States), and Iran still 
	executes juveniles.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yahya's ethical points are no more 
	valid. His fundamental point is that an &quot;ignorant society&quot; is &quot;a society 
	where people live only for the satisfaction of their own desires&quot;, and that 
	in such a context, &quot;it surely is not possible to maintain peace, love and 
	amity&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, this is either trivial or 
	false. It is trivial in the sense that everyone seeks the &quot;satisfaction of 
	their own desires&quot;, even the Islamist, whose obedience of Allah exists only 
	because he desires to be obedient. It is false in the sense that prosperity 
	and harmony of interests can only obtains if people act neither for their 
	own detriment, nor for the detriment of others. Self-sacrifice and its 
	derivates, Yahya's proposed solution, goes against his calls for peace, 
	well-being and happiness, the end of all evil acts, respect for life and 
	progress.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yahya also seems to be confused, or 
	dishonest, in his discussions of the afterlife and its ethical consequences. 
	The finiteness of our lives is not a motivator to do evil: on the contrary, 
	the fact that our life is the only one we have motivates the atheist to try 
	to make the best life for himself on this Earth. Doing evil would only be a 
	waste. But for someone who is assured of living forever, such considerations 
	are irrelevant: his only accountability is to believe in Allah. There is no 
	reason for a religious person to do good, except by imitation of the 
	behaviour of non-religious people.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As for his accusations of falsehood, 
	well, Yahya's articles themselves provide the best argument against that, 
	don't they?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I already mentioned, his claims 
	of results for Islam are contradictory. Self-sacrifice is not compatible 
	with accomplishment. Likewise, his calls for fear of God, faith, servitude, 
	and struggle against one's own nature, are all negative psychological 
	factors which go against his positive claims. These are not the words of 
	self-accomplishment, but the words of delusion and psychosis.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That much is acknowledged by any 
	person of sense, religious or not. Yahya, however, sees no problem in this, 
	and rather contends that believers like him are in the minority and 
	persecuted because Allah wants to test them :<br>
	&quot;Surely this is not a coincidence but a special situation created 
	deliberately by God for a certain cause. That believers are in the minority 
	makes their virtuous conduct even more precious in this world. Furthermore, 
	this is a factor enhancing their rewards in the Hereafter&quot;.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Surely it should be questioned why a 
	good god would create 6 billion people, and then throw them in Hell, with 
	the sole goal of testing believers. One way or another, it reflects little 
	except Yahya's high opinion of himself and his fellow &quot;true believers&quot;.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is little in Yahya's work, as 
	represented by his web site, which is intelligent, laudable, or even 
	original. His exposition of complex natural systems is marred, like Behe's, 
	by an arrogant &quot;design&quot; premise. In the end, there is nothing to recommend 
	it. </font></p>
