  <h2 align="center"><font size="4">by Natalie Angier</font></h2>
  &nbsp;
  <p>In the course of reporting a book on the scientific canon and pestering
  hundreds of researchers at the nation's great universities about what they see
  as the essential vitamins and minerals of literacy in their particular
  disciplines, I have been hammered into a kind of twinkle-eyed cartoon coma by
  one recurring message. Whether they are biologists, geologists, physicists,
  chemists, astronomers, or engineers, virtually all my sources topped their
  list of what they wish people understood about science with a plug for
  Darwin's dandy idea. Would you please tell the public, they implored, that
  evolution is for real? Would you please explain that the evidence for it is
  overwhelming and that an appreciation of evolution serves as the bedrock of
  our understanding of all life on this planet?<img alt="My God Problem" src="angierart.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="325" height="163"></p>
  <p>In other words, the scientists wanted me to do my bit to help fix the
  terrible little statistic they keep hearing about, the one indicating that
  many more Americans believe in angels, devils, and poltergeists than in
  evolution. According to recent polls, about 82 percent are convinced of the
  reality of heaven (and 63 percent think they're headed there after death); 51
  percent believe in ghosts; but only 28 percent are swayed by the theory of
  evolution.</p>
  <p>Scientists think this is terrible—the public's bizarre underappreciation
  of one of science's great and unshakable discoveries, how we and all we see
  came to be—and they're right. Yet I can't help feeling tetchy about the
  limits most of them put on their complaints. You see, they want to augment
  this particular figure—the number of people who believe in
  evolution—without bothering to confront a few other salient statistics that
  pollsters have revealed about America's religious cosmogony. Few scientists,
  for example, worry about the 77 percent of Americans who insist that Jesus was
  born to a virgin, an act of parthenogenesis that defies everything we know
  about mammalian genetics and reproduction. Nor do the researchers wring their
  hands over the 80 percent who believe in the resurrection of Jesus, the laws
  of thermodynamics be damned.</p>
  <p>No, most scientists are not interested in taking on any of the mighty
  cornerstones of Christianity. They complain about irrational thinking, they
  despise creationist &quot;science,&quot; they roll their eyes over America's
  infatuation with astrology, telekinesis, spoon bending, reincarnation, and
  UFOs, but toward the bulk of the magic acts that have won the imprimatur of
  inclusion in the Bible, they are tolerant, respectful, big of tent. Indeed,
  many are quick to point out that the Catholic Church has endorsed the theory
  of evolution and that it sees no conflict between a belief in God and the
  divinity of Jesus and the notion of evolution by natural selection. If the
  pope is buying it, the reason for most Americans' resistance to evolution must
  have less to do with religion than with a lousy advertising campaign.</p>
  <p>So, on the issue of mainstream monotheistic religions and the irrationality
  behind many of religion's core tenets, scientists often set aside their
  skewers, their snark, and their impatient demand for proof, and instead don
  the calming cardigan of a a kiddie-show host on public television. They
  reassure the public that religion and science are not at odds with one
  another, but rather that they represent separate &quot;magisteria,&quot; in
  the words of the formerly alive and even more formerly scrappy Stephen Jay
  Gould. Nobody is going to ask people to give up their faith, their belief in
  an everlasting soul accompanied by an immortal memory of every soccer game
  their kids won, every moment they spent playing fetch with the dog. Nobody is
  going to mock you for your religious beliefs. Well, we might if you base your
  life decisions on the advice of a Ouija board; but if you want to believe that
  someday you'll be seated at a celestial banquet with your long-dead father to
  your right and Jane Austen to your left-and that she'll want to talk to you
  for another hundred million years or more—that's your private reliquary, and
  we're not here to jimmy the lock.</p>
  <p>Consider the very different treatments accorded two questions presented to
  Cornell University's &quot;Ask an Astronomer&quot; Web site. To the query,
  &quot;Do most astronomers believe in God, based on the available
  evidence?&quot; the astronomer Dave Rothstein replies that, in his opinion,
  &quot;modern science leaves plenty of room for the existence of God . . .
  places where people who do believe in God can fit their beliefs in the
  scientific framework without creating any contradictions.&quot; He cites the
  Big Bang as offering solace to those who want to believe in a Genesis
  equivalent and the probabilistic realms of quantum mechanics as raising the
  possibility of &quot;God intervening every time a measurement occurs&quot;
  before concluding that, ultimately, science can never prove or disprove the
  existence of a god, and religious belief doesn't—and shouldn't—&quot;have
  anything to do with scientific reasoning.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>How much less velveteen is the response to the reader asking whether
  astronomers believe in astrology. &quot;No, astronomers do not believe in
  astrology,&quot; snarls Dave Kornreich. &quot;It is considered to be a
  ludicrous scam. There is no evidence that it works, and plenty of evidence to
  the contrary.&quot; Dr. Kornreich ends his dismissal with the assertion that
  in science &quot;one does not need a reason not to believe in something.&quot;
  Skepticism is &quot;the default position&quot; and &quot;one requires proof if
  one is to be convinced of something's existence.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In other words, for horoscope fans, the burden of proof is entirely on
  them, the poor gullible gits; while for the multitudes who believe that, in
  one way or another, a divine intelligence guides the path of every leaping
  lepton, there is no demand for evidence, no skepticism to surmount, no need to
  worry. You, the religious believer, may well find subtle support for your
  faith in recent discoveries—that is, if you're willing to upgrade your
  metaphors and definitions as the latest data demand, seek out new niches of
  ignorance or ambiguity to fill with the goose down of faith, and accept that,
  certain passages of the Old Testament notwithstanding, the world is very old,
  not everything in nature was made in a week, and (can you turn up the mike
  here, please?) Evolution Happens.</p>
  <p>And if you don't find substantiation for your preferred divinity or your
  most cherished rendering of the afterlife somewhere in the sprawling emporium
  of science, that's fine, too. No need to lose faith when you were looking in
  the wrong place to begin with. Science can't tell you whether God exists or
  where you go when you die. Science cannot definitively rule out the heaven
  option, with its helium balloons and Breck hair for all. Science in no way
  wants to be associated with terrifying thoughts, like the possibility that the
  pericentury of consciousness granted you by the convoluted, gelatinous, and
  transient organ in your skull just may be the whole story of you-dom. Science
  isn't arrogant. Science trades in the observable universe and testable
  hypotheses. Religion gets the midnight panic fêtes. But you've heard about
  evolution, right?</p>
  <p>So why is it that most scientists avoid criticizing religion even as they
  decry the supernatural mind-set? For starters, some researchers are themselves
  traditionally devout, keeping a kosher kitchen or taking Communion each
  Sunday. I admit I'm surprised whenever I encounter a religious scientist. How
  can a bench-hazed Ph.D., who might in an afternoon deftly purée a colleague's
  PowerPoint presentation on the nematode genome into so much fish chow, then go
  home, read in a two-thousand-year-old chronicle, riddled with internal
  contradictions, of a meta-Nobel discovery like &quot;Resurrection from the
  Dead,&quot; and say, gee, that sounds convincing? Doesn't the good doctor
  wonder what the control group looked like?</p>
  <p>Scientists, however, are a far less religious lot than the American
  population, and, the higher you go on the cerebro-magisterium, the greater the
  proportion of atheists, agnostics, and assorted other paganites. According to
  a 1998 survey published in Nature, only 7 percent of members of the
  prestigious National Academy of Sciences professed a belief in a
  &quot;personal God.&quot; (Interestingly, a slightly higher number, 7.9
  percent, claimed to believe in &quot;personal immortality,&quot; which may say
  as much about the robustness of the scientific ego as about anything else.) In
  other words, more than 90 percent of our elite scientists are unlikely to pray
  for divine favoritism, no matter how badly they want to beat a competitor to
  publication. Yet only a flaskful of the faithless have put their nonbelief on
  record or publicly criticized religion, the notable and voluble exceptions
  being Richard Dawkins of Oxford University and&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Daniel Dennett of Tufts University. Nor have Dawkins and Dennett earned
  much good will among their colleagues for their anticlerical views; one
  astronomer I spoke with said of Dawkins, &quot;He's a really fine parish
  preacher of the fire-and-brimstone school, isn't he?&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So, what keeps most scientists quiet about religion? It's probably
  something close to that trusty old limbic reflex called &quot;an instinct for
  self-preservation.&quot; For centuries, science has survived quite nicely by
  cultivating an image of reserve and objectivity, of being above religion,
  politics, business, table manners. Scientists want to be left alone to do
  their work, dazzle their peers, and hire grad students to wash the glassware.
  When it comes to extramural combat, scientists choose their crusades
  cautiously. Going after Uri Geller or the Ra‘lians is risk-free
  entertainment, easier than making fun of the sociology department. Battling
  the creationist camp has been a much harder and nastier fight, but those
  scientists who have taken it on feel they have a direct stake in the debate
  and are entitled to wage it, since the creationists, and more recently the
  promoters of &quot;intelligent design&quot; theory, claim to be as scientific
  in their methodology as are the scientists.</p>
  <p>But when a teenager named Darrell Lambert was chucked out of the Boy Scouts
  for being an atheist, scientists suddenly remembered all those gels they had
  to run and dark matter they had to chase, and they kept quiet. Lambert had
  explained the reason why, despite a childhood spent in Bible classes and
  church youth groups, he had become an atheist. He took biology in ninth grade,
  and, rather than devoting himself to studying the bra outline of the girl
  sitting in front of him, he actually learned some biology. And what he learned
  in biology persuaded him that the Bible was full of . . . short stories. Some
  good, some inspiring, some even racy, but fiction nonetheless. For his
  incisive, reasoned, scientific look at life, and for refusing to cook the data
  and simply lie to the Boy Scouts about his thoughts on God—as some advised
  him to do—Darrell Lambert should have earned a standing ovation from the
  entire scientific community. Instead, he had to settle for an interview with
  Connie Chung, right after a report on the Gambino family.</p>
  <p>Scientists have ample cause to feel they must avoid being viewed as
  irreligious, a prionic life-form bent on destroying the most sacred heifer in
  America. After all, academic researchers graze on taxpayer pastures. If they
  pay the slightest attention to the news, they've surely noticed the escalating
  readiness of conservative politicians and an array of highly motivated
  religious organizations to interfere with the nation's scientific
  enterprise—altering the consumer information Web site at the National Cancer
  Institute to make abortion look like a cause of breast cancer, which it is
  not, or stuffing scientific advisory panels with anti-abortion &quot;faith
  healers.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Recently, an obscure little club called the Traditional Values Coalition
  began combing through descriptions of projects supported by the National
  Institutes of Health and complaining to sympathetic congressmen about those
  they deemed morally &quot;rotten,&quot; most of them studies of sexual
  behavior and AIDS prevention. The congressmen in turn launched a series of
  hearings, calling in institute officials to inquire who in the Cotton-pickin'
  name of Mather cares about the perversions of Native American homosexuals, to
  which the researchers replied, um, the studies were approved by a panel of
  scientific experts, and, gee, the Native American community has been
  underserved and is having a real problem with AIDS these days. Thus far, the
  projects have escaped being nullified, but the raw display of pious dentition
  must surely give fright to even the most rakishly freethinking and comfortably
  tenured professor. It's one thing to monkey with descriptions of Darwinism in
  a high-school textbook. But to threaten to take away a peer-reviewed grant!
  That Dan Dennett; he is something of a pompous leafblower, isn't he?</p>
  <p>Yet the result of wincing and capitulating is a fresh round of whacks. Now
  it's not enough for presidential aspirants to make passing reference to their
  &quot;faith.&quot; Now a reporter from <i>Newsweek</i> sees it as his
  privilege, if not his duty, to demand of Howard Dean, &quot;Do you see Jesus
  Christ as the son of God and believe in him as the route to salvation and
  eternal life?&quot; In my personal fairy tale, Dean, who as a doctor fits
  somewhere in the phylum <i>Scientificus</i>, might have boomed, &quot;Well,
  with his views on camels and rich people, he sure wouldn't vote
  Republican!&quot; or maybe, &quot;No, but I hear he has a Mel Gibson
  complex.&quot; Dr. Dean might have talked about patients of his who suffered
  strokes and lost the very fabric of themselves and how he has seen the
  centrality of the brain to the sense of being an individual. He might have
  expressed doubts that the self survives the brain, but, oh yes, life goes on,
  life is bigger, stronger, and better endowed than any Bush in a jumpsuit, and
  we are part of the wild, tumbling river of life, our molecules were the
  molecules of dinosaurs and before that of stars, and this is not Bulfinch
  mythology, this is corroborated reality.</p>
  <p>Alas for my phantasm of fact, Howard Dean, M.D., had no choice but to
  chime, oh yes, he certainly sees Jesus as the son of God, though he at least
  dodged the eternal life clause with a humble mumble about his salvation not
  being up to him.</p>
  <p>I may be an atheist, and I may be impressed that, through the stepwise
  rigor of science, its Spockian eyebrow of doubt always cocked, we have learned
  so much about the universe. Yet I recognize that, from there to here, and here
  to there, funny things are everywhere. Why is there so much dark matter and
  dark energy in the great Out There, and why couldn't cosmologists have given
  them different enough names so I could keep them straight? Why is there
  something rather than nothing, and why is so much of it on my desk? Not to
  mention the abiding mysteries of e-mail, like why I get exponentially more
  spam every day, nine-tenths of it invitations to enlarge an appendage I don't
  have.</p>
  <p>I recognize that science doesn't have all the answers and doesn't pretend
  to, and that's one of the things I love about it. But it has a pretty good
  notion of what's probable or possible, and virgin births and carpenter
  rebirths just aren't on the list. Is there a divine intelligence, separate
  from the universe but somehow in charge of the universe, either in its
  inception or in twiddling its parameters? No evidence. Is the universe itself
  God? Is the universe aware of itself? We're here. We're aware. Does that make
  us God? Will my daughter have to attend a Quaker Friends school now?</p>
  <p>I don't believe in life after death, but I'd like to believe in life before
  death. I'd like to think that one of these days we'll leave superstition and
  delusional thinking and Jerry Falwell behind. Scientists would like that, too.
  But for now, they like their grants even more.&nbsp;</p>
