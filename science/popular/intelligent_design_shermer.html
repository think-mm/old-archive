					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to 
					intelligent-design theory, life is too complex to have 
					evolved by natural forces. Therefore life must have been 
					created by a supernatural force — an intelligent designer. 
					ID theorists argue that because such design can be inferred 
					through the methods of science, IDT should be given equal 
					time alongside evolutionary theory in public school science 
					classes. Nine states have recently proposed legislation that 
					would require just that.<br>
					<br>
					The evolution-creation legal battle began in 1925 with the 
					Scopes &quot;monkey&quot; trial, over the banning of the teaching of 
					evolution in Tennessee. The controversy caused textbook 
					publishers and state boards of education to cease teaching 
					evolution — until the Soviets launched Sputnik in the late 
					1950s and the United States realized it was falling behind 
					in the sciences. <br>
					<br>
					Creationists responded by passing equal-time laws that 
					required the teaching of both creationism and evolution, a 
					strategy defeated in a 1968 Arkansas trial that found that 
					such a law attempted to &quot;establish religion&quot; in a public 
					school and was therefore unconstitutional. This led to new 
					equal-time laws covering &quot;creation science&quot; and &quot;evolution 
					science.&quot; In 1987, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 7 to 2, 
					said teaching creation science &quot;impermissibly endorses 
					religion by advancing the religious belief that a 
					supernatural being created humankind.&quot; <br>
					<br>
					This history explains why proponents of intelligent design 
					are careful to never specify the true, religious nature of 
					their theory and to insist that what they are doing is 
					science. For example, leading ID scholar William Dembski 
					wrote in his 2003 book, &quot;The Design Revolution&quot;: 
					&quot;Intelligent design is a strictly scientific theory devoid 
					of religious commitments. Whereas the creator underlying 
					scientific creationism conforms to a strict, literalist 
					interpretation of the Bible, the designer underlying 
					intelligent design need not even be a deity.&quot; <br>
					<br>
					But let's be clear: Intelligent-design theory is not 
					science. The proof is in the pudding. Scientists, including 
					scientists who are Christians, do not use IDT when they do 
					science because it offers nothing in the way of testable 
					hypotheses. Lee Anne Chaney, professor of biology at 
					Whitworth College, a Christian institution, wrote in a 1995 
					article: &quot;As a Christian, part of my belief system is that 
					God is ultimately responsible. But as a biologist, I need to 
					look at the evidence…. I don't think intelligent design is 
					very helpful because it does not provide things that are 
					refutable — there is no way in the world you can show it's 
					not true. Drawing inferences about the deity does not seem 
					to me to be the function of science because it's very 
					subjective.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					Intelligent-design theory lacks, for instance, a hypothesis 
					of the mechanics of the design, something akin to natural 
					selection in evolution. Natural selection can and has been 
					observed and tested, and Charles Darwin's theory has been 
					refined.<br>
					<br>
					Intelligent-design theorists admit the difference, at least 
					among themselves. Here is ID proponent Paul Nelson, writing 
					last year in Touchstone, a Christian magazine: &quot;Right now, 
					we've got a bag of powerful intuitions, and a handful of 
					notions such as 'irreducible complexity' and 'specified 
					complexity' — but, as yet, no general theory of biological 
					design.&quot; <br>
					<br>
					If intelligent design is not science, then what is it? One 
					of its originators, Phillip Johnson, a law professor at UC 
					Berkeley, wrote in a 1999 article: &quot;The objective is to 
					convince people that Darwinism is inherently atheistic, thus 
					shifting the debate from creationism versus evolution to the 
					existence of God versus the nonexistence of God. From there 
					people are introduced to 'the truth' of the Bible and then 
					'the question of sin' and finally 'introduced to Jesus.' &quot;
					<br>
					<br>
					On March 9, I debated ID scholar Stephen Meyer at 
					Westminster College in Fulton, Mo. After two hours of debate 
					over the scientific merits (or lack thereof) of IDT, Meyer 
					admitted in the question-and-answer period that he thinks 
					that the intelligent designer is the Judeo-Christian God and 
					that suboptimal designs and deadly diseases are not examples 
					of an unintelligent or malevolent designer, but instead were 
					caused by &quot;the fall&quot; in the Garden of Eden. Dembski has also 
					told me privately that he believes the intelligent designer 
					is the God of Abraham. <br>
					<br>
					The term &quot;intelligent design&quot; is nothing more than a 
					linguistic place-filler for something unexplained by 
					science. It is saying, in essence, that if there is no 
					natural explanation for X, then the explanation must be a 
					supernatural one. Proponents of intelligent design cannot 
					imagine, for example, how the bacterial flagellum (such as 
					the little tail that propels sperm cells) could have 
					evolved; ergo, they conclude, it was intelligently designed. 
					But saying &quot;intelligent design did it&quot; does not explain 
					anything. Scientists would want to know how and when ID did 
					it, and what forces ID used.<br>
					<br>
					In fact, invoking intelligent design as God's place-filler 
					can only result in the naturalization of the deity. God 
					becomes just another part of the natural world, and thereby 
					loses the transcendent mystery and divinity that define the 
					boundary between religion and science.</font><br>
