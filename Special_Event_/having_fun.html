  part of growing up.</strong></em></font><br>
  </center>
  <p><i>Of all the stages in our lives it is our childhood that we remember most
  fondly. It is the only time when we are allowed to be without much
  responsibility, to run wild and to play with abandon. For many of us our
  childhood memories are closely associated with toys that were cheaply made yet
  were the most prized of our possessions- a rag doll, a few clay pots and pans,
  a colourful kite or a rolling wooden top. Along with all this was a different
  kind of play culture. People lived in lively, close-knit neighbourhoods called
  'paras' where the children of each house would get together in the afternoon
  to play chchiburi or hadudu, tilo-express or some other game that involved a
  lot of laughing, shouting and running around. The excitement of the
  competition and sheer joy of connecting with other kids, was something that
  made the whole ritual of playing so addictive. Although many traditional toys
  can still be found at village markets or melas, their presence in the cities
  is very rare having been quickly replaced by mechanised plastic, or metal
  versions. Along with them, traditional games played for hundreds of years by
  children of this region, are also on the verge of disappearance.These toys and
  games are representative of Bangali culture and psyche. They signify our
  people's creativity and imagination as well as the fun-loving spirit in every
  child. With Pahela Baishakh just around the corner SWM talks to people of
  various generations about the toys and games that made growing up fun.</i>

  <font size="2"><em><strong>Getting ready for a game of 'panch guti' (five
  pebbles).</strong></em></font><br>
  </center>
  <p>Most traditional toys were simple and made of indigenous material such as
  clay or wood. Take the miniature clay pots and pans that closely resembled the
  ones adults used for cooking. Even cooking accessories such as clay pata puta
  to grind spices, spoons and ovens that could actually be used to cook were
  included in a girl's play paraphernalia. The best part was that while they
  were easily breakable they were also easily replaceable. Later, as clay
  utensils began to be replaced by aluminium pots and pans, play tin versions
  were introduced. Wood also an easily available material has been used to make
  many toys such as lattoo (top), bows and arrows and toy animals.
  <p><center><img align="absMiddle" alt="Logo" hspace="0" src="cover3.jpg" width="350" ?><br>
  <br>
  </center>
  <p>Some toys can still be found at the occasional village mela. These include
  the 'gudguti' (a rattle-like toy that consists of a small round drum filled
  with seeds with a stick attached) that is turned round and round to make a
  loud whining sound; the tom tom, a little drum that makes loud tapping sounds
  when swerved this way and that with the hand, the balloon flute- a balloon
  that has to be inflated first and then the air released- again to make a loud
  sound. The top or latim is a toy that is very much a part of the Bangalee
  culture. It seems to be there at every mela. Of the two types of tops there
  are the entirely wooden types and the ones with metal ends. The latter demands
  more skill as it has to be worked on the floor and has to be deftly projected
  using a thin piece of rope. The wooden ones come with an automatic mechanism
  enabling you to simply pull a string and release the top on to a wooden plate.
  Another curious contraption is a flat wooden drum on two clay wheels which is
  pulled by a string tied to two sticks. When the string is pulled, the wheels
  move and a tiny drumstick taps on the drum making a rattling sound. All this
  and much more would be found at the bazaar, during melas, or from the
  wandering vendor who, Pied Piper like, would have a sizable number of children
  of all ages, running around him to see the treasure. The arrival of the Khelna
  Pheriwala , in fact was always highly anticipated as he brought with him every
  child's fantasy. Even now once in a while you can see such a vendor walking
  around braving the scorching sun to bring his ware. Shocking pink, yellow,
  orange and red are the colours painted on these toys to attract children.
  While the plastic toys are quite crude looking, the wooden ones are still
  adorned with pretty traditional patterns.

  <font size="2"><em><strong>Playing 'Hari Patil' with clay pots and pans and
  flower petals to make fake food.</strong></em></font><br>
  </center>
  <p>The 'biscope' now virtually extinct, was one of the most visible
  characteristics of rural life, especially those of children. A young vendor,
  usually a boy would come to the village centre carrying a big 'magic' box,
  usually made of wood that had a handle on the side and two round windows and a
  cloth covering to stimulate a dark room. For a few annas one could look into
  the window, head covered by a cloth to create the appropriate darkness. Inside
  pictures would be shown like a slide projection when the operator cranked up
  the machine. The pictures would relate to a story sung in a ballad form by the
  operator. The stories would invariably be about kings and queens, famous
  folktales that came to life through the bioscope.
  <p>Playing with dolls, a universally popular activity among girls especially,
  has been around from the earliest times. In rural areas before the intrusion
  of the plastic, blond haired versions, little girls spent hours recreating a
  world of rag dolls or 'Kaporer putul'. Made from discarded bits of cloth and
  thread, the dolls with faces crudely drawn on them, could be of various sizes.
  A whole family of dolls were often made with the help of the adult female
  members of a family, perhaps an aunt, an older sister or even a mother when
  she had some free time. &quot;We used to go through great pains to produce
  beads, ribbons and sari bits to make up the dolls' wardrobe consisting of
  jewellery and saris of various colours&quot;, says a veteran doll player, now
  a university teacher in her sixties. Sometimes beads in vibrant colours could
  be bought from the bazaar or else they would be taken off from necklaces.
  Pillows, kanthas, beds and other furniture were also part of the doll
  ensemble. But it was the range of activities associated with doll playing that
  made it so enjoyable. Girls would often get their respective dolls together
  and play from hours on end. 'Putul Biye' (Doll's Wedding) was always quite a
  grand affair with actual food being cooked and served to privileged guests
  usually doll keepers and their friends and a few favourite relatives. Sticking
  close to traditional norms, the owner of the male doll or groom could take
  away the female doll or bride and keep both of them. Sometimes through an
  amicable agreement the dolls could be returned to the respective owners thus
  avoiding possible heartache.

  <font size="2"><em><strong>With electricity reaching the countryside, it took
  no time for them to switch to the all absorbing video games that have invaded
  the village markets.</strong></em></font><br>
  </center>
  <p>In contrast to this sedate, gracious doll playing were the activities of
  boys who instinctively went for noisier, more aggressive toys. 'Teer Dhonuk'
  (bows and arrows) made of bamboo for mock fights, 'gulail' or gulti (catapult)
  to scare away birds and squirrels, or unsuspecting adults, and the butterfly
  sticks to race around the village.
  <p>Traditional games and toys in fact, were the favourite sources of
  entertainment for children and teenagers. That was prior to the cable
  television invasion and before the computer gained popularity in the country.
  Games such as kabadi or hadudu, shatchara, baraf pani, gollachut, dariabandha,
  birinchi, kutkut, tilo express etc used to attract the youngsters belonging to
  both urban and rural areas. Although these games could not be considered
  serious sports, the enthusiasm they would generate was remarkable indeed.
  <p><center><img align="absMiddle" alt="Logo" hspace="0" src="cover6.jpg" width="350" ?><br>
  <font size="2"><em><strong>Playing with marbles can be quite an intense
  business.</strong></em></font><br>
  </center>
  <p>Dangguli is basically a boy's game and is usually played in an open field.
  Two wooden sticks, one around 12 to 15 inches long, and another 2 to 2.5
  inches long stick, are needed for this game. The bigger one is called danda (
  stick ) and the smaller one is called guli. The guli is cut in the shape of a
  pencil which is sharpened on its both sides. So when the guli is kept on the
  earth with the middle part touching the ground, but both sides a little higher
  from the surface. Two or more players can play this game. The first player
  hits on one side of the guli with the danda, the guli goes upwards and after a
  certain height it begins to come down. Before it falls down on the earth the
  player has to hit it around the middle part of the guli while it is still in
  the air, and send it as far as possible. Each player gets three hits and the
  one who can hit the guli to the greatest distance in his three stipulated
  chances is the winner.
  <p>One of the most popular games in our country for both boys and girls is 'Hadudu',
  which is actually very much similar to 'Kabadi' the national sport. &quot;It
  is basically the same game, in 'Hadudu' the players have to hold their breath
  and utter ha-du-du like some magic mantra, the only difference in kabadi is
  that you have to run after your opponent uttering kabadi,&quot; says Ruba, a
  lecturer of Economics at a private university who loved playing hadudu with
  her friends in her high school days. The prerequisite for this boisterous game
  is a field of course. All the players are divided into two teams. One player
  of the team goes across the middle line into the area of the other team all
  the while uttering 'ha-du-du' without taking any breath. His objective is to
  touch a player of the other team while he goes on chanting 'hadudu' and to
  come back to his own area without being captured by the opponent team members.
  If he manages to touch a player of the rival team, the latter will be declared
  'out' or 'dead'. But if he is captured he is out. If all the players of one
  team are 'dead' or 'out, and the other team has some of its players still
  'alive and kicking', the former party is said to be defeated and the latter
  team will score a point as the winners. Thus, the game continues.

  <p>Nadia a 27-year-old architect says she was hooked to 'Gollachut', another
  action filled game. It is played between two teams of equal number of players.
  A team takes stand at a fixed point on one side of the field. Players of the
  other team position themselves at strategic points on the field facing the
  team that has also taken position with one 'king' at a fixed point. The
  players of the king's team run as fast as they can to cross the field. The
  players of the other team try to prevent them from reaching the crossing line.
  If the king's team members can cross the team without being touched by the
  opponent they will win the game. Nadia says, &quot; I used to play this game
  with my younger sister, cousin brothers and friends 3-4 days of the
  week.&quot; She had once badly sprained her ankle while playing the game. Her
  parents were furious with her since her SSC exams were just two months away.
  &quot;I was not at all perturbed about my exams I was more upset because my
  injury prevented me from playing for more than a month,&quot; smirks the
  vivacious woman who claims that she will never 'be too old' to play her
  favourite childhood sport 'Gollachut'. &quot;The trouble is it would be
  slightly difficult to round up my old play mates and entice them to a game of
  'gollachut'. Most of them have become too 'old' and boring for such
  adventure,&quot; she observes.

  <p>The girls of today may not be familiar with the game 'Kukut', but it used
  to be very popular among both school and college girls even five or six years
  back. The game Kutkut may seem very simple apparently but those who played it
  know it is not that easy to master the game. A box with eight squares is
  chalked out. Any number of players can take part in the game. One needs to
  throw the 'chara' (pebble) in the first square and push it through to the last
  square of the box using one foot. If the pebble touches the lines within the
  box, the player will be out. The player must also hold his/her breath and say
  'kutkut' while pushing the pebble.
  <p>After reaching the last square the person can rest a bit and take a deep
  breath. Then, it's a journey back to where he/she started from in the same
  manner. After playing all the eight squares, a player can 'buy' a square one
  at a time. She/he has to stand in the semi circle in front of the box and
  throw the pebble in the direction of the squares. Many women remember taking
  part in serious 'Kutkut' matches.

  children.</strong></em></font><br>
  </center>
  <p>'Ekka Dokka' a Bangali version of 'Hop Scotch' is similar to kutkut, but
  the rules are much easier. For example, there is no need to utter 'kutkut' and
  holding one's breath.

  <font size="2"><em><strong>Watching T.V. has become the most popular form of
  entertainment even in the village, wiping out the desire to play games that
  were intrinsic to rural life.</strong></em></font><br>
  </center>
  <p>Dariabandha is another game that used to have a sizeable fan following in
  the cities as well as the villages. In this game a field is made under certain
  rules equally divided with lines from each other. Players are equally divided
  into two teams. When a player of any team is able to cross the field from the
  starting point to the finishing point and vice versa, his team will win the
  game. Nafis an MBA working in a private computer firm was very fond of 'dariabandha'
  in his school/college days. &quot;I think it was my best friend's cousin who
  introduced me to this wonderful game,&quot; Nafis muses. &quot;He was a year
  older than us and we used to think he was very 'cool' when we were in our
  teens. So, naturally we liked Dariabandha since he taught the game to
  us.&quot; In fact, Nafis says that he continued to play the game even in his
  university days and had to endure a lot of teasing from his friends who
  considered 'Dariabandha' to be a 'soft' game for the girls!&quot; Not that
  their taunting remarks bothered Nafis much. In his opinion, Dariabandha is
  just as 'macho' as football.

  <p>Tilo-express (it can be roughly translated as hide and seek) is another
  interesting game. This game is usually played inside the house or in places
  like garage or storeroom, because the place must have a lot of places to hide.
  There can be players numbering anything between 3 to 6 or even more. One of
  them, usually chosen by lottery, closes his eyes and starts counting from say,
  1 to 50/100, loudly to give others the time to hide. Once the counting is done
  he/she starts hunting for those who are in hiding. While searching he has to
  be very careful to make sure that no one can, among those who are in hiding,
  touch him and say Tilo. Whenever he finds one, say he has found one called
  Kuddus, he will have to say &quot;Kuddus, express&quot;. In this way, he will
  have to find out each and everyone in hiding, but at the same time remain
  alert so that no one from the hiding can come out and touch him without his
  knowledge. After one successfully finds out everyone, it will be the turn of
  the player, who was found out first, to do the searching.

  <p>Bagaduli is an indoor game. The Bagaduli board, shaped like the English
  word U turned upside down, is made of hard board. The upper portion of the
  board is higher than the lower part like that of a slope and the entire board
  is surrounded by a wall. The whole board is divided into several small areas,
  each of them fenced by little nails/pegs. Each of these small areas have
  certain points like 20, 30, 50 or100. On the right hand side of the board
  there is a narrow alley which starts from the lower part and goes upward. Five
  or six marbles are lined in that alley. One has to strike a marble with the
  finger or a ball pen. Once released off the alley the marble can get into any
  of the fenced areas or even miss all of them or get into a red marked area in
  which case the player is out. It all depends on the force with which one has
  stricken the ball. Now, after one finishes playing all his 5 marbles he will
  add the total and write it in a book. Then the next player will take his
  chance. Say, the players have decided for 5 rounds, so after all the players
  finish their stipulated rounds, total will be made for each of the players and
  the highest point getter is the winner.

  <p>If there is one game that most people, particularly those within the 20 to
  30 age group like to recall with a lot of enthusiasm, it is definitely
  Shatchara. This game also requires two teams, a solid brick, a tennis ball and
  several smooth pieces of brick or dices. The tiny pieces of bricks have to be
  positioned one on top of the other on the big piece of brick. The team that
  wins the toss gets to aim the ball at the bricks. The players of the other
  team try to catch the ball. If the 'bowler' manages to hit the target and
  knock down the little brick tower, he or she has to move very quickly and
  attempt to pick up the pieces again. The rest of his or her team also has the
  same intention. Meanwhile the opponent team tries to prevent them from going
  near the bricks. If they can hit any of the other team members with the ball,
  the latter would be out of the game.
  <p>Noushin, a final year civil engineering student admits that arguments were
  quite common when she played outdoor games, especially when it came to Bouchi.
  This is also another action -packed game comprising two teams. Two circles are
  drawn in the field. The &quot;bou&quot; or the bride sits in one section and
  the whole purpose of the game is to rescue the bou. Her team members stay on
  the other circle and try to bring her back to their territory by warding off
  the opponent members. The opponents stand on guard and try to prevent them
  from getting close to the bride. The bou's team players one by one get out of
  their enclosure and utter 'chiburi' or 'kutkut' with the intention of
  capturing the players of the other party. If they manage to touch someone, he
  or she is out. But if they cannot hold their breaths for long, the opponent
  team can grab him or her. Incidentally, the 'bou' does not sit idle. He or she
  looks for the perfect opportunity to run from her section to where her friends
  are keeping an eye on the opponents who will try to stop her from achieving
  her mission.

  <p>No one really knows where the name 'Opent ti Biscope' has come from. One
  theory is that it is a derivation of 'Open the Biscope'. Whatever it means
  almost every adult today knows how it is played and most female adults have
  played it at least once during their childhood. Very similar to the English
  game of 'Oranges and Lemon', the game involves quite a number of players. The
  front pair form an arch by lifting and joining their arms while the rest keep
  going through the arch while a chant is said out loud : Openti bioscope, titan
  ti-scope; Sultana bebi ana, shaheb babu boithok khanai…
  <p>When the chant is over, whoever happens to be under the arch, gets caught.
  &quot;There was not much challenge to the game&quot;, says Sharmin, a school
  teacher, &quot; but we thoroughly enjoyed because of all the singing and just
  being together with friends.&quot;

  <p>Kite-flying was not only a popular hobby in our country but in many other
  countries in Asia too. In China and Japan, kite-flying festivals are grand
  events where ornate kites of different sizes and shapes are displayed.
  <p>The traditional Bangladeshi kite is made of two thin sticks of bamboo, a
  certain length of string or thread, thin paper and glue. In Bangladesh,
  kite-flying may not be taken to such fervent heights, but even a few years
  back kite-flying was an activity that most people, men or women tried at least
  once in their lives. As a retired Government officer Habibur Rahman recalls,
  &quot;Kite-flying was my passion as a school student. Every afternoon I would
  go to the rooftop of a five-storey building close to my home and play with my
  kite.&quot; His mother used to worry a lot, since there was a risk that he
  might accidentally fall from the roof. &quot;But I used to hide my kite in our
  store room and make up stories to fly kite every day right after lunch,&quot;
  he reminisces. The most interesting thing about kite-flying is the 'kite
  match'. In a match, several kite-fliers start flying kites. If the thread of
  one flier gets entangled with another both the fliers apply their own skills
  to try to get each other's thread cut off. When one competitor succeeds in
  cutting off the thread of his or her rival, he wins the match.

  <p>Phul Tokka is another game popular with young girls. It is played in teams.
  The kids divide into two teams, ideally each team consisting of four or five
  kids. Each team decides on a leader. The leader gives each member a code name;
  after a flower, like golap or shapla. The leader of a team goes up to the
  opposition and covers someone's eyes and calls out to a teammate by her flower
  name (Ay re amar golap). The person called golap walks up and taps the
  forehead of the blindfolded person. It is up to the blindfolded person to
  guess the identity of the tapper. If a player correctly guesses the identity
  of the tapper, he or she gets to jump forward. Players from both teams keep
  jumping forward until someone reaches the end line. First party to do that
  wins.
  <p>Chhoa Chhui is probably the simplest of all childhood games. It is
  basically a game where you run around and try to catch someone. The person who
  gets caught becomes the chor and the chor becomes the one running around
  trying to catch all the others. All this running is good exercise and this
  game is particularly good for cardiovascular fitness. A variation of this game
  is Kanamachhi, where the chor is blindfolded and the rest of the children
  constantly tease and provoke the chor by chanting the immortal chorus &quot;Kanamachhi
  bho bho, jaake paash, take chho&quot;: Catch whoever you can. The blindfolded
  chor, madly runs around chaotically throwing his hands around, like a bull
  provoked by the matadors. This game is almost always played in an enclosed
  area; otherwise it is pointless since it would be impossible to catch people
  blindfolded in an unbounded area.

  <font size="2"><em><strong>What could be more pleasurable than running wild

  </center>
  <p>Yet another variation of this catch-me-if-you-can game is Borof Pani. Here
  the chor plays the role of Mr. Freeze. He catches his victims and screams
  borof (ice) in order to freeze them. It is up to the other players to save the
  frozen ones by tapping them and shouting out pani. This unfreezes them and
  they are then free to run around again. However, it is quite tricky to
  unfreeze someone since Mr. Freeze will carefully guard his frozen victims so
  he can freeze anyone who tries to come to their rescue.
  <p>Ludu has always been the most popular board game among children in
  Bangladesh, although it is widely played all around the world. The first
  player to make a trip around the board and make it to &quot;home&quot; wins.
  The game is often continued to determine second place, and so on.
  <p>Carom board is very popular and is a game where one can become highly
  skilled through practice. The conventional version of the game is played in
  groups of two, each group going after one chips of one colour. The team that
  wins the board gets points for each opposition chip remaining on the board,
  and extra points if they have taken the red piece. The first team to take
  twenty-nine points wins. There is another unofficial version of Carom played
  by kids called Taalgaachh. Chips are stacked one on top of the other at the
  centre of the board. Everybody sinks as many pieces as they can, regardless of
  colour. In the next round everyone puts back into the board a number of pieces
  equal to what the person with the least chips has. This is continued till only
  one player survives. Carom is one of those addictive games that become popular
  in school or even the workplace.

  <p>Today kids are hooked on computer games at home or watch TV for hours on
  end, sometimes without even speaking a word to another human being. There are
  hardly any fields to play in and as for closely knit neighbourhoods, those too
  are relics of the past. For those of us lucky enough to have grown up at a
  time when roads were safe enough for children to walk around unchaperoned,
  when neighbours were like family and a wooden toy train would evoke just as
  much thrill as a battery operated race car today, the toys and games of our
  childhood are still very much part of what we would call the best times of our
  past.
  <p>These days, children hardly play any traditional games; they are more into
  cricket, football and badminton or they do not play any sport whatsoever.
  Electricity has reached many villages across the country, which has led to the
  popularity of the television and cassette player. The 'country games' as a
  young banker terms them, are no longer fun as they are not considered 'trendy'
  or 'cool'. Thus, they have been replaced in an unfair and undignified manner
  by leisure activities that are more congruous to the modern times.
  <p>Yet it is perhaps naïve to think that toys like the rag doll or the simple
  bow and arrow can compete with the ubiquitous Barbie doll and the battery
  operated laser gun. Nor can we hope to lure the video game buff away from the
  latest computer game. Children, after all will adopt that which is new and
  trendy. At the same time we can still let them know about the traditional toys
  and games that filled our childhood with so much joy. Institutions such as the
  Shishu Academy and museum can procure and preserve these toys before they
  completely die out. Games of course, can be revived nation wide say, through
  competitions in school and colleges which can be televised and shown on
