<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">25th Baishakh, 1409 Bangla year, the <b>
141st birth anniversary of Rabindranath Thakur</b>, the foremost icon of Bengali 
literature and culture who single-handedly transformed our beloved Bengali 
language into its today’s modern and mature form by virtue of his extraordinary 
creative genius. A true internationalist in spirit and a firm believer of 
universal humanism, he toiled hard to promote and propagate the Bengali language 
and literature in the world stage which eventually led to his winning of the 
Nobel prize for literature in 1913. Much has been written about his unfathomable 
contribution to Bengali literature but not enough light has been shed on many 
other remarkable features of the beautiful mind of this myriad-minded man. One 
such less talked about side of this towering personality was his social and 
political consciousness, which we will try to address here briefly in our 
today’s birthday tribute to him. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">- <b>He wholeheartedly believed in the 
unity of the Hindu and Muslim communities</b> and often publicly took stand in 
favour of the then downtrodden Muslim community. He actively took part in the 
movement against the partition of Bengal in 1905 and composed the theme song of 
that historical movement, ‘Banglar maaTi, Banglar jal’. He was also the 
initiator of the symbolic ritual of ‘raakhibandhan’ between the members of the 
two communities. But then he had the moral courage to denounce and discard this 
apparently noble movement, for it’s increasingly communal nature and oppressive 
role on the poor Muslim traders and farmers, as depicted in his ‘ghare baaire’ 
novel, later filmed by Satyajit Ray. In his later life he also vehemently 
protested against the proposal of making ‘Bande Mataram’ the national anthem of 
India, for it’s communal overtone and for being potentially offensive to the 
Muslim community of India. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">-&nbsp; <b>He was not an adherent of the 
narrow nationalist ideology and opposed it all along, both in national and 
international arena</b>, for the fear of it’s potential danger of becoming 
divisive and chauvinistic, which we are all witnessing now in dismay through out 
South Asia and in other corners of the world. A man of conscience, he was at the 
same time very critical of the oppressive imperialist regime of the British 
India. We are all aware of his disowning the knighthood for the atrocities 
committed by the British soldiers on the innocent population of Jalianwalaabag 
and the accompanying scathing diatribe against the British government. He also 
wrote another passionate letter in the newspaper from the sickbed just two 
months before his death denouncing the British ruler in no uncertain terms for 
it’s shamelessly self-serving and hypocritical role in India.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">- <b>As a socially conscious person he 
was very much aware of the cruel oppression and discrimination against the 
Indian women in the name of culture</b>, tradition and religion. He openly 
sympathized with the victimized women, strongly denounced all those oppressive 
social norms and practices and preached for the equal rights for the Indian 
women in many of his writings, such as ‘streer patra’, ‘chitrangadaa’, ‘jogajog’ 
etc to name a few. His sympathy for the women wasn’t confined to words only; he 
made conscious efforts to translate that into action. One such glorious example 
is arranging marriage of his own son Rathindranath Thakur to a child-widow 
Pratima Debee.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">These three arbitrarily selected 
characteristics of Rabindranath are only a few among many of his other socially 
conscious and committed outlooks. We all should strive to know more about this 
exceptionally open-minded, truly modern and progressive personality and 
implement his humanist teachings in our personal and social lives.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">That will be the greatest tribute to our 
beloved poet Rabindranath, who has provided us with both our national identity 
as Bangali and the national anthem, ‘aamaar sonaar bangla, aami tomaay 
bhaalobaasi.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
