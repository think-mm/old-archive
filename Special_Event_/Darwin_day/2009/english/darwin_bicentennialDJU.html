<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="3">Charles Darwin, who 
single-handedly changed the field of evolutionary biology, was born 200 years 
ago in England on February 12, 1809.&nbsp; On the other side of Atlantic another 
person, who had transformed American society through socio-political reform, was 
also born on the same day.&nbsp; He is none other than President Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp; 
Americans are very proud of “Abe” Lincoln whose action, as the president during 
the Civil War, had changed the social landscape of America.&nbsp; Lincoln’s action 
had started the emancipation of blacks who were mostly working in southern 
plantations at the time.&nbsp; Many American historians think that this movement 
initiated by President Lincoln nearly 145 years ago had culminated in the 
election of Barack Obama on November 4, 2008.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="3">In this article I will stay focused on Darwin but 
from time to time I will digress to talk about how the world was during the 
nineteenth century when Industrial Revolution just got started.&nbsp; Charles 
Darwin’s birth took place in propitious time, undoubtedly.&nbsp; A plethora of 
knowledge in natural history was already garnered in Europe.&nbsp; Thanks to the 
emergence of an elite upper crust in Europe.&nbsp; These people did not have to toil 
to eke out a living. &nbsp;They had plenty of free time in their hand too.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, the political events of late eighteenth century in France and 
America were too good to be true from the perspective of openness.&nbsp; The power of 
clergies on the other hand was on the wane in Europe.&nbsp; Many enlightened families 
flush with money were allowing their kids to learn new knowledge in biology, 
physics, chemistry, geography, etc.&nbsp; Darwin’s family was one of the lucky ones.&nbsp; 
Charles Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, was a poet, physician, scientist, 
and social reformer.&nbsp; What a combination!&nbsp; He wrote a book entitled “<i>Zoonomia</i>” 
to investigate various animal life forms. This book written by Erasmus Darwin 
discussed the evolution of life forms long before Charles would propound his 
famous scientific theory of speciation.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt">
<font face="Verdana" size="3">Darwin was born seven years after his grandfather 
was laid to rest.&nbsp; I think as a teenager Darwin had read what his grandfather 
wrote on evolution.&nbsp; I would call this a jumpstart on the part of Charles.&nbsp; 
Being a child raised in a family where money was aplenty, Charles was able to 
undertake voyages all across the Atlantic down to the tip of South America.&nbsp; 
Charles was awed by the diversity of life form.&nbsp; He was a keen observer; 
therefore, variations in the pattern of beak formation among finches of closely 
related species evoked an interest, which probably would have gone unnoticed 
amongst other young men of his time.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt">
<font face="Verdana" size="3">The world prior to Charles Darwin was not exactly 
the days of ignorance.&nbsp; When other parts of the world were plunged into 
darkness, Europe was having the time of enlightenment a big time.&nbsp; German 
theologian Martin Luther revolted against the supremacy of the Pope in 1530.&nbsp; 
Since then, a lot has happened all across Europe.&nbsp; Freed from the shackle of 
religious orthodoxy many European societies have opened a healthy dialogue on 
society, education, literature, fine arts, etc.&nbsp; This continued well into the 
dawn of nineteenth century.&nbsp; Of course, the contribution of the two seminal 
events, viz., the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789 
dwarf the other events.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="3">The emergence of a new moneyed class in England, 
France, Germany, etc., has impacted the European glasnost in the 18<sup>th</sup> 
and 19<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; The Darwin clan was a quintessential moneyed 
family in England; therefore, Charles as a youngster had all the opportunities 
to go into any area of studies.&nbsp; It is a blessing in disguise that young Charles 
decided to venture into field biology and become a naturalist.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt">
<font size="3" face="Verdana">A question that has vexed me from time to time is 
– what if Darwin was aware of Gregor Mendel’s work on the genetic segregation of 
traits in garden peas.&nbsp; The Austrian priest had systematically studied the 
principle of the inheritance of characteristics through the combination of genes 
from parent cells.&nbsp; Both Darwin and Mendel were contemporaries; however, Darwin 
was unaware of Mendel’s pioneering work, which led to the development of a field 
call Genetics.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt">
<font face="Verdana" size="3">I recently read an article on Charles Darwin 
published in the Smithsonian magazine from where I learned that Gregor Mendel 
had in his possession the German version of Darwin’s <i>Origin of Species</i>.&nbsp; 
It is a mystery to many why Mendel never did connect genes to Darwin’s theory of 
speciation.&nbsp; If change in genetic traits were the basis or building blocks of 
Darwin’s theory of evolution, then why Mendel never thought the genes that 
determined the color of garden peas to be the same material.&nbsp; Of course, it took 
nearly half a century to realize that nucleic acid is the building block of a 
gene.&nbsp; Also, it took about 80 more years before Watson and Crick would discover 
the three dimensional structure of DNA</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt">
<font face="Verdana" size="3">Darwin’s scientific theory on evolution is 
considered a landmark finding by all biologists in modern time.&nbsp; By the dawn of 
twentieth century, Darwin’s theory was only a 35-year old concept; however, most 
botanists and zoologists had accepted the concept.&nbsp; Darwin’s followers were 
growing by leaps and bounds allover the world and when molecular biologists were 
able to sequence the DNA only then the beauty of Darwin’s theory began to reveal 
itself.&nbsp; The study of genomics started in America and Western Europe hardly 30 
years ago and by now the genomics of bacteria, yeast, fungi, human, Arabidopsis 
(a miniature plant), soybean, rice, etc., have been worked out.&nbsp; The 
computer-aided DNA sequence alignments of similar genes among various organisms 
have led to the birth of a field call <i>Bio-informatics</i>.&nbsp; And trust me — it 
is a burgeoning field of studies where biology and computer science had tied 
their knots.&nbsp; Through the sequence similarities studies we learned that at 
molecular level, humans and chimps have gene similarities better than 99% for 
96% of the genome that codes for functional proteins.&nbsp; Folks who have nothing 
but disdain for Darwin’s theory could now seal their lips for the evidence is 
too strong that humans have evolved from chimps over several millions years.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt">
<font face="Verdana" size="3">No modern-day academician worth his salt would 
deny the veracity of Darwin’s theory of evolution.&nbsp; However, there still exist a 
few naysayers among life scientists and educationists who would deny the 
contribution made by Charles Darwin.&nbsp; Many of them have coined such a term as 
“Intelligent Design” to hint that life forms that exist in the world have 
evolved simultaneously as has been written in the pages of Genesis in Bible or 
in Koran.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt">
<font face="Verdana" size="3">What is the future of Darwinism?&nbsp; Going forward, 
scientists would learn how many genes are expressed before a disease would set 
in at molecular level.&nbsp; From these results researchers would figure out how to 
block the expression of such genes.&nbsp; It is through this interference of gene 
expression will the scientist be able to block the development of a particular 
type of cancer.&nbsp; Many genetic therapies will be discovered in the coming days.&nbsp; 
These are just a few concrete examples of the positive effect of Darwinism. &nbsp;</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt">
<font face="Verdana" size="3">In summary, I see a great future for Darwinism.&nbsp; 
Through this short article I tried to explain that Charles Darwin was able to 
garner knowledge from the writings of other naturalists including his 
grandfather Erasmus Darwin.&nbsp; The other thing that I discussed is the impact of 
the work of Gregor Mendel on Darwin’s and vice versa.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they 
failed to understand the interconnectivity between genetics and evolution.&nbsp; 
Finally, I touched on the future acceptance of Darwinism amongst escapists.&nbsp; The 
good news is that Darwinism is solidly grounded to molecular biology, genomics, 
bio-informatics, and many other developing fields.&nbsp; All of these were possible 
because the precocious mind of Charles Darwin was able to see the origin of 
species.&nbsp; He must have had a beautiful mind, unquestionably</font></p>
