of modern men when the issue is how life forms have evolved from simplest such

lifelong student of <span class="yshortcuts">Darwin’s theory of evolution</span> 
I was thinking how I should remember the life of this great discoverer on his 
200th birthday.&nbsp; It will be redundant to enumerate the life story of this 
extraordinary human being.&nbsp; There will be other writers who would pen article to 
glorify his accomplishments.&nbsp; I however decided to discuss
<span class="yshortcuts">chemical evolution</span>, which Darwin had no idea 
whatsoever.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">Most 
biologists agree that the <span class="yshortcuts">primitive life forms</span> 
were much simpler than the ones that evolved later.&nbsp; Similarly, the chemicals 
(organic molecules) that make up simpler microorganism should also be simpler.&nbsp; 
Therefore, how these organic molecules first arose spontaneously should be a 
subject of interest to any students of ecology and evolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">On 
October 17, 2008 New York Times ran a story on Prof. Stanley Miller’s legendary

little twist to the story.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">
Stanley Miller who being a graduate student was a budding researcher in 1953 at 
the <span class="yshortcuts">University of Chicago</span>.&nbsp; His thesis advisor 
was Professor Harold C. Urey, a famous organic chemist at the time.&nbsp; Prof Urey 
and Miller performed experiments to probe the <span class="yshortcuts">origin of 
life</span> at chemical level.&nbsp; Those experiments open the mind of many 
researchers in the 1950s and 1960s.&nbsp; However, the data collected at the time was 
re-analyzed and these yielded new results.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">It 
is befitting to discuss the <span class="yshortcuts">seminal works</span> of 
Miller and Urey on Darwin ’s Day celebration in 2009.&nbsp; Scientific truth has 
infinite shelf life; therefore, as long as the conclusions drawn from those 
experiments are still valid and irrefutable, we could discuss the findings to 
enrich our mind.&nbsp; At the heart of Miller and Urey’s experiments was this 
question: Could simple chemical units of life be generated spontaneously?</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">This 
year marks the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin ’s book “<span class="yshortcuts">Origin 
of Species</span>.” During Darwin ’s time biologists specializing on speciation 
and other related subjects were more interested in relatedness among species.&nbsp; 
Many of the scientists were called Naturalists.&nbsp; There weren’t many people 
interested in the chemical aspect of origin of life.&nbsp; That will come about 40-50 
years later at the time when academic communities allover the world had already 
accepted Darwin ’s <span class="yshortcuts">scientific theory of evolution</span>.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">Many 
Darwinists would have argued in the dawn of the twentieth century about
<span class="yshortcuts">chemical basis of life</span>.&nbsp; Did those molecules 
that sustain life at cellular level evolved spontaneously as earth was cooling 
down after the “Big Bang”?&nbsp; Now, what were the constituents of both the
<span class="yshortcuts">primitive cells</span> (simple prokaryotes) and modern 
cells (eukaryotes)?&nbsp; The primitive cells were more interesting to biologists, 
undoubtedly. Scientists in early twentieth century knew that the cell of
<span class="yshortcuts">Mycoplasma</span> (a primitive bacterium) had primarily 
lipid, nucleic acids, proteins, and secondarily other metabolites.&nbsp; Therefore, 
many life scientists in 1920s and 1930s asked – could the building blocks of 
nucleic acid, protein, and lipid be formed spontaneously?&nbsp; Professor Aleksandr 
Oparin was the first scientist to ask this question in 1920s.&nbsp; To unravel this 
scientific problem Professor Urey directed Stanley Miller, a grad student at the 
time, to design a few experiments. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">
These earlier experiments conducted at the Chicago University are known as 
Miller-Urey experiments.&nbsp; Any good high school textbook of biology should 
contain the summary of these experiments.&nbsp; Yes, a handful of amino acids were 
synthesized when Miller put ammonia (a nitrogen source), methane (a carbon 
source), and hydrogen – all in gaseous form along with water in a sealed flask 
(under reducing environment) and applied electrical sparks to simulate the 
effect of lightning.&nbsp; A week later, amino acids, the <span class="yshortcuts">
building blocks of proteins</span>, were formed out of simple gaseous molecules, 
which were presumed to be abundant when simple life forms were evolving.&nbsp; 
However, a few critics noted that earth’s environment was not 100% anaerobic 
when earliest life forms were evolving and Miller acknowledged this pitfall in 
his experiments.&nbsp; Nonetheless, Stanley Miller became quite famous for his 
discovery and he went on to become a professor at the <span class="yshortcuts">
University of California at San Diego</span> after his postdoctoral stints at 
Columbia and Caltech.&nbsp; He died at the age of 77 in 2007.&nbsp; </span>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">
After the death of Prof. Miller, Dr. Jeffrey Bada of <span class="yshortcuts">
Scripps Institution of Oceanography</span> in San Diego, who happened to be 
Miller’s ex-grad student, found boxes containing hundreds of vials of dried 
residues collected from the experiments done during 1953-1954.&nbsp; </span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">Dr. 
Bada carefully read the description under which Prof. Miller performed these 
experiments.&nbsp; Interestingly, two sets of experiments were carried out under 
varying conditions.&nbsp; One used a different spark generator and the other injected 
steam onto the sparks.&nbsp; The second set was thought to be interesting because 
Miller had replicated what might have existed in lagoons and tidal pools around 
volcanoes where <span class="yshortcuts">primitive life forms</span> may have 
seen first light of the day, figuratively speaking, of course!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">Dr. 
Bada gave the task of identifying amino acids in Miller’s samples to Adam 
Johnson, a visiting grad student from <span class="yshortcuts">Indiana 
University</span> to his lab.&nbsp; In his 1953 paper Miller reported the synthesis 
of 5 amino acids.&nbsp; Samples taken from the original set of experiment had been 
re-analyzed by Johnson using more powerful <span class="yshortcuts">analytical 
instruments</span> available today and the result was astounding.&nbsp; Nine more 
amino acids were present in minute amounts in the original sample.&nbsp; When Johnson 
analyzed samples from the apparatus with the steam injector, he detected 22 
amino acids, including 10 that had not been detected before in the original
<span class="yshortcuts">Miller-Urey experiment</span>.&nbsp; This new finding was 
published on October 17, 2008 issue of the <span class="yshortcuts">prestigious 
Science journal</span>.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">Now, 
what does all this means? First, nearly all amino acids were synthesized through 
abiogenesis.&nbsp; In presence of minute amounts of water vapor the spark was able to 
split apart <span class="yshortcuts">water molecule</span> resulting in a wider 
range of chemical reaction to take place.&nbsp; It is remarkable that under this 
condition nearly all the amino acids were formed from simple gaseous compound.&nbsp;
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">Many 
evolutionary biologists now think that ocean bottom is the most likely place 
where the building blocks came together as a <span class="yshortcuts">living 
organism</span>.&nbsp; Then, there are other schools of thought on how the building 
blocks of life came to earth.&nbsp; The discovery of amino acids in meteorites hinted 
that building blocks of life came from space.&nbsp; It hardly matters where the 
building blocks of molecule such as amino acid came from.&nbsp; Mother Nature had a 
rich inventory of molecules in the dawn of the evolution to work with and set 
the stage for the first life to begin.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">In 
summary, about 150 years ago <span class="yshortcuts">Charles Darwin</span> 
published his famous book on origin of species.&nbsp; Since then, many scientists 
explained the chemical basis of life.&nbsp; One intriguing question was how the first 
set of molecules that are needed for life was created.&nbsp; Stanley Miller and his 
research advisor, <span class="yshortcuts">Harold Urey</span> did the first 
experiment in 1953 to synthesize in the lab a set of 5 amino acids.&nbsp; A modern 
method now reveals an extra set of 9 amino acids.&nbsp; When Miller injected steam 
into the reaction vessel, all <span class="yshortcuts">20 amino acids</span> 
were made through abiogenesis.&nbsp; This result was published in October 2008 after 
re-analyzing the original sample with modern <span class="yshortcuts">analytical 
instrument</span>.&nbsp; This new finding goes to prove unequivocally that life could 
be formed from simple chemicals produced through abiogenesis.&nbsp; If Charles Darwin 
were to be alive today, he would have been very pleased with the new findings of 
Johnson and Dr. Bada.&nbsp; I think it is befitting that this new discovery came at a 
time when the world is celebrating the bicentennial of Darwin whose
<span class="yshortcuts">seminal work</span> on evolution has changed the course 
of scientific discourse among evolutionary biologists.&nbsp; That is not his theory 
had impacted such other fields of learning as anthropology, sociology, 
philosophy, medicine, etc.&nbsp; It is only a matter of time when Darwin ’s work will 
be accepted universally.&nbsp; Let me bring the closure to this article by quoting 
Henry David Thoreau who wrote, “Let us not underrate the value of a fact; it 
will one day flower into a truth.”</span></font></p>
