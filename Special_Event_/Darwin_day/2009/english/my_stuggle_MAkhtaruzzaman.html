<font face="Verdana">On this auspicious occasion of 150<sup>th</sup> year of 
publication of <i>The Origin of Species, </i>I would like to pay my personal 
respect and homage to the memory of its great writer, the immortal Charles 
Robert Darwin, who by his writings laid the foundation of the Science of 
Evolution.<i> </i>I wholeheartedly believe in what Theodosius Dobzhansky once 
said, <i>nothing in Biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.</i> 
One can go even further - nothing in human knowledge makes any sense except in 
the light of the doctrine of evolution and that, for this realization, we are 
all indebted to Charles Darwin. I fervently believe that Darwin has provided us 
with the most rational and scientific worldview, which no religion or even 
philosophy could provide. </font></p>

<span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">It was not easy for me to arrive at this conviction. There 
were many obstacles and hurdles that I had to overcome on the way. Besides, it 
took quite some time - many years indeed. For the benefit of the future 
Evolutionists of my country, Bangladesh, let me briefly narrate this <i>sojourn</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">My first obstacle was the conservative worldview of a 
Muslim rural society of Bengal where I was born in 1933. Almost all the 
villagers were illiterate (presently almost 60%). They were deeply religious and 
largely ignorant. One or two boys before me went to Madrasah. One of my father’s 
cousins and me were lucky to be sent to High English Schools which were 
apparently secular institutions. Uncle became a Physician and I, a Botanist - 
Plant Cytogeneticist. </font></p>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">At school I never even heard about Evolution. The 
Intermediate College Biology textbook had a very small chapter, <i>Evidences of 
Evolution</i>, incidentally the last one, which our teachers never even touched. 
I took Pure Botany instead of Biology at this level. Botany textbooks did not 
mention a word about Evolution. “Elements of Evolution” was taught at the 
Bachelor level but only as part of Zoology. Even at the Masters level, courses 
in Botany had nothing about Evolution. The prevailing view was that Evolution is 
a concern of Zoology since Darwin was a Zoologist. The innately conservative, 
Islamic creationist mind-set of our teachers and students remain the greatest 
obstacle in acquiring proper knowledge about Evolution even now. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Later on, when I was a Postgraduate student of Notre Dame 
University, USA (late 1962 to early 1967), I found that a course on Evolution 
was being offered at my Department of Biology. I took this course with great 
expectations. The course teacher, a good specialist on Amphibian evolution, 
discussed mostly Population Dynamics, seemingly avoiding ‘controversial’ topics 
which I was more eager to learn like Historical development of the concept of 
evolution, Darwinism, Evidences for Evolution, Synthetic Theory of Evolution, 
Speciation, Origin of Life, Origin of Man etc.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">Naturally one may wonder, under the circumstances, how I 
came to have so much interest in Evolution. I owe this initially to my 
acquaintance during school days with some revolutionaries who fought for 
Independence of India from British rule. Incidentally, they were all from the 
Hindu community which was educationally and culturally more advanced in those 
days. All of them were imprisoned by the British Raj for several years or for 
life in the Andaman Islands. With their education being interrupted at school or 
college levels they continued their self-study inside the prisons which was 
encouraged by the British rulers in the hope that it may induce them to give up 
their dangerous ideas of armed struggle. Eventually, nearly all the prisoners 
turned out to be self-educated persons, well versed on diverse subjects. Almost 
all of them became Marxists in outlook. I got acquainted with some of them after 
their release when I was a student of High School. Through long discussions and 
study under their guidance, I came to learn, precociously for my age, some 
things which I would not have known otherwise. The most important thing was that 
I began to cherish rationality, secularism, and scientific objectivity by 
discarding religious dogmatic worldview. Definitely this helped me to gradually 
acquire the Evolutionary Worldview. I hope to reminisce more about this aspect 
of my learning on some other occasion.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">The Idea of Evolution, including others like Secularism, 
was obviously considered anti-Islamic and potentially Anti-State in the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan, established in 1947 on the basis of religion. Hardly 
anybody in Pakistan felt encouraged to teach such “subversive” subjects like 
Evolution. Even among the university teachers there were some who would weed out 
potential “anti-state and subversive elements” from among students and make sure 
that such elements did not get good enough grades to qualify as teachers. It was 
not surprising that I did not come across a convinced evolutionist among my 
teachers in this socio-political atmosphere. </font></p>

<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">I returned from the States in 1967 and joined the 
department of Botany of Dhaka University. In those days there was practically no 
academic freedom in Pakistan’s educational institutions. By enacting the 
infamous “Black Act”, the Dhaka University Order 1951, the Pakistan Government 
had done away with whatever Academic freedom was available in this University 
during the British Rule. The Vice Chancellor could unilaterally remove any 
teacher from his position without assigning any reason. Teachers had to take his 
prior permission before publishing anything or even giving interviews to Radio 
and TV. This was part of a system designed to suppress the so-called Anti-State 
and Subversive Elements. Persons suspected of such activities could be removed 
from jobs and even put behind bars for indefinite periods without trial. No one 
could be appointed without verification of antecedent by the political police.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">Under these circumstances I concentrated on teaching and 
guiding research in Plant Cytogenetics. I also began to teach and modernize 
courses of Cytology and Genetics, which are important to understand the modern 
concept of Evolution. I wrote textbooks on all these subjects in Bangla since I 
believe that Science at all levels must be taught in the mother tongue. The fact 
that Bangla is one of the richest languages of the world strengthened my 
determination enormously. All these I was doing as preparation in the hope that 
sometime in the future I may be able to present a course on Evolution.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">With the victory of our liberation struggle on 16<sup>th</sup>December, 
1971, the situation changed drastically in newly independent Bangladesh. The 
1972 Constitution of the Peoples’ Republic of Bangladesh declared Democracy, 
Secularism, Nationalism and Socialism as the four basic state principles. 
Through the enactment of 1973 Dhaka University Ordinance, later ratified by the 
parliament as 1973 Order, Dhaka University got full autonomy. Later the 
remaining three Public Universities got similar acts. Teachers and Officers of 
these Universities were allowed to hold and propagate any political view. They 
could even be members of any legal Political Party. Teachers could be elected to 
the Senate and the Syndicate, the policy making and the executive wings, 
respectively, of the University. The Vice Chancellor was an elected person, 
mostly from among the university teachers. The Departmental Academic Committee 
consisting of all the teachers could propose any course, get approval of the 
concerned Faculty and finally, of the Academic Council. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">This democratic atmosphere enabled me to avail the 
opportunity to materialize my longtime dream of offering a course in Evolution. 
I found it not too difficult to convince my colleagues about introducing a 
course in Evolution provided it dealt with Plant Evolution only. But the real 
difficulty was in convincing a few who were bent upon excluding animal 
evolution, particularly Human Evolution. Their opposition was mainly a 
reflection of their religious and political viewpoint. But I did not concede and 
got the course approved by all the relevant academic authorities. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">Thus I began to teach a course of Evolution carrying 100 
marks, i.e., a full paper of the final year of M.Sc. class. Like the rest of the 
papers, it was a compulsory one for all students. I divided the course into four 
parts – (i) the origin and evolution of Species or Speciation - pre-Darwinian, 
Darwinian and post-Darwinian ideas, (ii) the origin and evolution of Humankind, 
(iii) the origin and evolution of Life and (iv) the origin and evolution of the 
Non-living world or the Cosmos. I emphasized upon the fact that evolution of the 
living world is inseparable from that of the non-living world. I began to teach 
this course in 1974 and continued till December, 2008 with addition and 
alteration of the contents.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">Soon three other public universities introduced more or 
less the same course content of Evolution. When the Bangladesh National 
University was established to affiliate all the degree Colleges formerly 
affiliated to Dhaka and three other Universities, the course I was teaching at 
Dhaka University was made a compulsory full paper of 100 marks in M.Sc. final 
year class.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">This democratic atmosphere was unfortunately, short lived. 
The <i>coup de tat</i> which took place in 1975 initiated developments which 
turned Bangladesh into a semi-theocratic state due to&nbsp; changes brought about in 
the constitution by the military regimes. <i>Bismillah </i>(in the name of 
Allah) was made a part of the constitution. Islam was declared as the state 
religion. As a consequence, teaching evolution became as difficult as in the 
Pakistani days. In Chittagong University, the Islamic fundamentalist students 
forced cancellation of this course. The National University drastically reduced 
the course content. The single topic of Evidences of Evolution was finally 
removed from the Intermediate Biology around 2001.<span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">I found it not easy to continue teaching this course among 
the students having unquestioned faith in creationism and practically no earlier 
exposure to the concept of evolution. Therefore, right from the start I tried to 
help the students to differentiate between Creationism and Evolutionism by 
citing concrete examples. I tried to explain that Creationism is merely a faith, 
not supported by logic or evidence, whereas Evolution is a Science, supported 
both by logic and evidence, and&nbsp; above all by Scientific methods. Indeed 
Darwin’s success in discovering the first Law of Biology, the law of Evolution, 
was&nbsp; due&nbsp; to his ability to use the Scientific method in full for the first time 
in the history of Biology.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;I had to handle softly so as not to hurt the feelings of 
students. That’s why I discussed practically all versions of creationism except 
the Islamic one. This was the main reason as to why I did not write anything 
about it in my book <i>Evolution</i> (<i>Bibortanbidhya). </i>I&nbsp; also had&nbsp; an 
apprehension that the book may be prohibited. However, I gave references for the 
students to read. But these were too costly and not easily available. Even <i>
The Origin of Species </i>fell under this category. I, therefore, translated 
into Bangla (for the first time) <i>The Origin of Species</i>. My other books 
mentioned earlier were oriented towards this goal.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">Things improved as a result. Even then there were always a 
few students in the class who were not ready to accept in full the idea of 
evolution. They believed, like A. R. Wallace, that humans were created whereas 
all other organisms may have evolved. There were some who would accept evolution 
as a whole but being guided by the Creator. Therefore, I had to devote more and 
more time to the Evidences of Evolution. I tried to convince my students not to 
fall prey the concept of Teleology. I urged them not to use the Bangla word “<i>shrishti</i>” 
(creation) in place of “<i>utpotti</i>” (origin), a bad habit of almost all 
Bangalees,&nbsp; because “<i>shrishti</i>” (creation) has no place in Evolution.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">Being encouraged by the ideological opponents of evolution 
at home and abroad, a powerful, anti-evolutionist propaganda has begun to 
operate in Bangladesh also. Various TV channels and NGO’s are devoted to this 
task. The academic world in Bangladesh is being influenced by this force. There 
is a great need for concerted action by the evolutionists to counteract this. 
They should try to reach the vast majority who do not understand English or has 
no access to internet. We need to have books in Bangla written in popular style 
like those of Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, Victor J. Stenger and Mark Parekh. To 
begin with we could start translating their books, if possible, with exemption 
from royalty payments. Here I would like to cite one of my experiences. Some 
years ago after reading Steve Jones’ <i>The Languages of the Genes</i>, I wanted 
to make it available to our people in Bangla to give them some idea about 
heredity. I translated this book into Bangla as <i>Gener Bhasha </i>
<span style="font-family: SulekhaT">(<font size="4">&#2460;&#2495;&#2472;&#2503;&#2480; &#2477;&#2494;&#2487;&#2494;</font>)</span>. I 
sought permission of the author to publish <i>on gratis</i>. He kindly gave his 
permission but its publisher asked for a nominal fee of 500 pounds, for the 
first print. Even this was too much for any publisher here, including Bangla 
Academy. The rules and regulations of this Academy do not allow any payment to 
be made for foreign books. Finally, Dhaka University agreed to pay and <i>Gener 
Bhasha</i> was published. Somehow if such obstacles can be overcome we may get 
the above mentioned authors’ books translated and published and expect that good 
original books in Bangla will come out soon.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 6.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">
<font face="Verdana">We must urgently re-introduce in our SSC and HSC Syllabi 
some simple topics about Evolution such as Darwinism. It is amazing that in the 
21st century millions of our school and college graduates will never know 
anything about Darwin or Darwinism. Moreover, the same topics should be taught 
in our Government sponsored Madrasahs. The huge number of privately sponsored, 
but actually foreign funded,&nbsp; Qaomi Madrasahs, accused of being the breeding 
ground of Islamic Fundamentalism, must be brought under Government regulations 
and made to teach the same basic courses, besides the Islamic subjects, as in 
the schools. The Awami League, under whose leadership the secular Bangladesh 
state was established in 1971, has come to power last month after a long 
interval with more than 2/3<sup>rd</sup> majority seats in the parliament. The 
secular forces of Bangladesh have great hopes that the Government led by Prime 
Minister Sheikh Hasina will bring about the desired changes soon. </font></p>
