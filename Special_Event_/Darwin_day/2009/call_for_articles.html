<p>This 2009 is a very special year. Darwin's 200th Birthday will occur on 
February 12, 2009; it will also be the 150th Anniversary of the publication of 
his famous book, On The Origin of Species. </p>
<p>Mukto Mona would like to announce its support for the International Darwin 
Day celebrations on Feb 12th once again, in keeping with our aim of promoting 
Science and Humanity. Darwin and his first publication of the book The Origin of 
Species contributed to a change in human thoughts not just in the field of 
science, but also in the humanities. It contributed to ending forever certain 
creationist religious myths that had been a staple of human thought in many 
centuries that preceded it. And, it contributed to understanding human evolution 
and the process of life in a way that none had before it. The official website 
commemorating this event is <a href="http://www.darwinday.org">www.darwinday.org</a>&nbsp; 
and those interested may register individually to express their solidarity with 
the organizers of the event. </p>
<p>To commemorate this event, we would like to request our members to send their 
articles for our special Darwin Day page which would be launched on this day. 
Please send in your articles at <a href="mailto:mukto-mona@yahoogroups.com">
mukto-mona@yahoogroups.com</a>&nbsp; before Feb the 10th so that we have time to 
design the page in time for the celebration. Darwin Day is now becoming a major 
international celebration of science and humanity. Celebrate with us, and let us 
plan for a BIG celebration on the 12th February with you. </p>
<p>With thanks and best wishes, </p>
