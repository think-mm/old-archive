	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When we look at the world, we 
	encounter vast evidence confirming the evolutionary account of the history 
	of life, and nothing even remotely resembling a disproof of it. This is an 
	inexplicable mystery if, as creationists insist, God created the variety of 
	life through a means other than evolution. Had God done so, it would 
	scarcely be possible for the world not to abound with clear evidence 
	decisively refuting evolution--it would, in fact, be possible only if God 
	deliberately went about after creation carefully rearranging the world to 
	make it look as though evolution had occurred, so that His poor creations 
	might be misled, and thereby condemn themselves to an eternity in Hell. In 
	other words, assuming God exists in the first place, either He used 
	evolution as His means of creating the diversity of life on Earth, or else 
	He is an abhorrent liar and deceiver--titles which have traditionally been 
	reserved for the Devil.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What are some of the places in which 
	creationists should expect to find a smoking gun against evolution?<a href="#2">[2]</a></font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Fossil Record</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the crucial predictions made 
	by evolution is that one should find a general progression of increasingly 
	diverse and complex life forms when one traces the fossil record through 
	progressively higher strata of sedimentary rock. This is not to say that 
	there cannot be major extinctions on the one hand, or on the other hand that 
	simpler life forms are expected not to persist alongside more complex ones, 
	but simply that one will not find the most complex ones appearing alongside 
	the earliest appearance of the least complex ones--the appearance of 
	organisms in the fossil record should reflect the branching treelike 
	structure of evolution.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Had God wished to supply humanity 
	with decisive evidence refuting evolution, He therefore could easily have 
	done so by depositing, preserving, and later exposing to paleontologists 
	numerous mammalian fossils in the oldest rock strata--no difficult feat for 
	the omnipotent creator of the universe. In fact, had God desired, He could 
	have inverted the entire sequence of fossils with no more than a twitch of 
	His little toe, placing all of the fossils of austalopithecines and 
	rhinosceri in the oldest strata, and every last vestige of blue-green algae 
	in the newest.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet, when we look at the fossil 
	record we find the one kind of distribution that matches the predictions of 
	evolution, not one of the countless distributions that would not. 
	Creationist spokesmen are forced to seize upon any <i>ad hoc</i> explanation 
	they can think of to explain this--for instance, that Noah's Flood somehow 
	sorted out all of the fossils into exactly the pattern consistent with 
	evolution, and that God did not care about the fact that this would cause us 
	to be deceived; or that for some strange reason God decided to create life 
	over the course of aeons, in just the right kind of sequence that would fit 
	the predictions of evolution, and that He once again did not care that this 
	would cause us to be deceived. Surely it is more sensible simply to conclude 
	that evolution has occurred.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A second prediction of evolution is 
	that the fossil record should yield transitional forms. Evolution does not 
	require the fossil record to yield transitional forms as plentiful as the 
	stars, since the conditions of fossilization are severe, and some organisms 
	fossilize less easily than others, but one would reasonably become very 
	suspicious of evolution if, after more than a century of work, 
	paleontologists had not discovered any transitional forms at all. A complete 
	absence of transitional forms, in fact, is precisely what creationists 
	should expect. Paleontology, however, has yielded plentiful transitional 
	forms, of which a mere handful is listed here:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>From fish to amphibian</i>: 
		The fish <i>Eusthenopteron</i> and the early amphibian <i>Icthyostega</i> 
		share so many characteristics as to constitute a virtual bridge between 
		fishes and amphibians.<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>From amphibian to reptile</i>:
		<i>Seymouria</i>, according to Alfred Romer, &quot;exhibits such a 
		combination of amphibian and reptilian characters that its proper 
		position in the classification of vertebrates has been much disputed&quot; (Romer 
		1966:94).<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>From reptile to bird</i>: <i>
		Archaeopteryx</i> displays a distinct blend of major reptilian and avian 
		characteristics, and highly resembles the theropod reptiles of its time.<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>From reptile to mammal</i>:
		<i>Probelesedon</i> and <i>Massetognathus</i> exhibit both reptilian and 
		mammalian characteristics. <i>Probainognathus</i> even has two sets of 
		jaw joints--one reptilian and one mammalian. </font></li>
	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If we look to some of the less 
	prominent transitions in life, we find equally astounding transitional 
	forms. For instance, evolutionists have hypothesized that whales evolved 
	from the cow-like mesonychids. This is a hypothesis which many creationists 
	have ridiculed, and virtually all seem to have thought implausible. A 
	prominent creationist once complained about the lack of transitional forms 
	demonstrating this transition, thinking it a problem for evolution:</font></p>
	<p class="quote" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">if random evolution is 
	true, there must have been a large number of transitional forms between the
	<i>Mesonychid</i> and the ancient whale. Where are they? It seems like quite 
	a coincidence that of all the intermediate species that must have existed 
	between the <i>Mesonychid</i> and whale, only species that are very similar 
	to the end species have been found. (Behe 1994:61) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, no sooner had this 
	creationist spoken than his smoking gun vanished into thin air:</font></p>
	<p class="quote" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By 1994, [Phillip] 
	Gingerich and fellow paleontologists, including Hans Thweissen, had found 
	not one, but three intermediate species [<i>Pakicetus inachus</i>, <i>
	Ambulocetus natans</i>, and <i>Rodhocetus kasrani</i>] linking land mammals 
	to the archeocetes, the oldest swimming mammals. The midpoint of the series, 
	a marvelous animal called <i>ambulocetus natans</i> (the &quot;swimming whale who 
	walks&quot;), displayed exactly the combination of terrestrial and aquatic 
	adaptations that critics of evolution had called impossible, even in 
	principle. (Miller 1999:264) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Given that creatures such as 
	these--which creationists expect not to exist at all--exhibit obvious 
	transitional characteristics and exist in the places and time periods in 
	which evolutionists expect to find them, we again have no option but to 
	conclude either that evolution took place, whether through God's design or 
	not, or else that God created all of these creatures directly, transitional 
	characteristics and all, so that man might be deceived into rejecting the 
	true history of creation.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Patterns in Genetic Material</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Had God created life through means 
	other than evolution, He could have used the faintest whisper of his 
	boundless power to endow each kind of creature with a different form of 
	genetic material, or a completely different genetic code. But all life forms 
	on Earth use DNA and RNA as genetic material, with a code that admits of 
	only very rare and insignificant alterations, which is what one would expect 
	had all life evolved from a common ancestor.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">DNA, moreover, does not appear to 
	have been engineered for functionality. Species that look virtually 
	identical and live in equivalent climates on separate continents often 
	exhibit highly dissimilar DNA, while their DNA actually more closely 
	resembles that of different-looking species living in adjacent environments. 
	This is impossible to reconcile with the expectation that God would design 
	the DNA of every species to enable it to best function within its 
	environment, but matches exactly the expectation of evolutionists: adjacent 
	species have more similar DNA because these species share closer common 
	ancestry with one another than they do with creatures on different 
	continents, regardless of their adaptation to particular environments. 
	Similar-looking species with dissimilar DNA are the result of convergent 
	evolution--they are not necessarily closely related, but they have managed 
	to adapt in the same way to their environments, resulting in similar 
	appearance.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As if this were not enough, the DNA 
	of many organisms contains introns--segments of genetic material that are 
	transcribed into mRNA,<a href="#3">[3]</a> but are then excised before the 
	mRNA is translated into protein. In plain English, introns constitute 
	genetic garbage. We might expect meaningless but nonharmful sequences to 
	accumulate in the genome of an species as it evolves, but there is no 
	discernible reason for a creator to have put nonfunctional sequences into 
	the genome of any species.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And all of this does not even go 
	into the high degree of correspondence between molecular phylogenies and 
	evolutionary expectations, even for nonfunctional changes in 
	DNA--independent confirmation of evolutionary predictions that would serve 
	absolutely no purpose but deception in a world in which all life was created 
	directly by God.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Surely, a God that wished for us to 
	believe in special creation would have eliminated all of the evidence for 
	evolution that we have gathered through genetic research.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Evolution and Atheism?</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sometimes--most often when they are 
	addressing religious audiences, from whom they draw the most funding and 
	political clout--creationist spokesmen drop their scientific pretenses and 
	reveal their narrow religious motivations by attacking evolution as 
	atheistic. These creationists would have one believe that evolution 
	presupposes and promotes atheism simply because it contradicts their 
	particular interpretation of the Book of Genesis. Apparently they have 
	decreed through their own infallible, godlike powers, that their human 
	interpretation of Genesis is infallible, and that all who disagree with them 
	must therefore be atheists and enemies of religion, or at least the 
	unthinking dupes of such sinister forces, which they alone have had the 
	moral and intellectual fortitude to resist.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Evolution, however, poses no special 
	problem for the religious believer, as demonstrated by the fact that most 
	evolutionists have not felt any difficulty reconciling their scientific 
	knowledge with their belief in God. Creationist leaders attempt to frighten 
	the believers they address by pointing to atheistic evolutionists such as 
	Richard Dawkins, William Provine, and E. O. Wilson. Seldom, however, do they 
	seem to mention believing evolutionists such Kenneth R. Miller (1999), James 
	F. Haught, or Robert T. Pennock (1999). They ignore statements by church 
	assemblies supporting evolution.<a href="#4">[4]</a> Nor do they point out 
	polls that show that a full 40% of scientists believe that a god guided the 
	process of evolution (Witham 2002:54). Even many of those who believe that 
	evolution proceeds without divine input simply do not understand what 
	evolution is supposed to have to do with whether or not God created the 
	universe, whether or not He forgives us our sins, or whether or not He was 
	incarnated, crucified, and resurrected. While it is true that evolution 
	knocks down one traditional argument for the existence of God--the argument 
	from biological design--there are still plenty of other arguments left over 
	upon which evolution has no bearing. Apparently, what creationist spokesmen 
	really mean when they aver that evolution is atheistic, is that evolution is 
	incompatible with the exact doctrines which they have chosen to enshrine as 
	infallible. But most people consider it rather arrogant to declare that 
	deviation from your own exact doctrines is tantamount to atheism.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But isn't the wastefulness and 
	arbitrariness of evolution incompatible with the existence of God? Atheistic 
	evolutionists, naturally enough, tend to think so; but for the believer, the 
	wastefulness and arbitrariness of evolution presents no special problem not 
	already presented by the events of everyday life. Consider, for instance, 
	the wastefulness and arbitrariness present in the rape and murder of a 
	child: on the one hand, a person who is inclined to view such things as 
	incompatible with the existence of a loving god is already at the doorstep 
	of atheism, and will hardly be moved by the comparative tameness of the 
	evolutionary history of life. On the other hand, it would be a sick joke 
	beyond measure to suggest that anyone capable of genuflecting at the altar 
	of God after considering the rape and murder of a child could possibly have 
	his or her faith shaken by the cruelty of the evolutionary process. As far 
	as the matter of atheism versus theism goes, the wastefulness and 
	arbitrariness of evolution is either redundant or irrelevant.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Bible and Creationism</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Creationist leaders conclude from 
	their interpretation of the Book of Genesis that evolution cannot have 
	occurred. However, in doing so they presuppose that their personal 
	interpretative powers are infallible. In asserting that God must have 
	inspired the creation stories in Genesis, that He could not have inspired 
	for any purpose mythological creation stories, and that He could not have 
	meant for the creation stories in question to be interpreted in any other 
	way than that which the creationist leader finds most intuitive, these 
	creationists seem to place very severe constraints upon what God can and 
	cannot do. What is even more strange is that these people are typically the 
	same ones who loudly berate evolutionists for ostensibly trusting human 
	reason over the word of God. These creationists do not seem to realize that 
	their judgement that Genesis is the word of God, and their judgement about 
	how Genesis is to be interpreted, are both products of their own distinctly 
	human reasoning. To reason is inescapable, whether there is a god or not.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hence, instead of immediately 
	declaring our first impressions about the Book of Genesis to be infallible, 
	and then refusing to budge regardless of evidence, let us not be afraid to 
	embrace the faculty of reasoning which, if God exists, can have come from no 
	one but Him. Let us consider what our most cautious scholarship tells us at 
	this point about the creation stories in the Book of Genesis.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The current consensus among biblical 
	scholars regarding the first five books of the Bible is embodied in what is 
	known as the Documentary Hypothesis. For the purposes of our discussion, we 
	need only note that the Documentary Hypothesis detects the hands of four 
	distinct authors (or sets of authors) in the Book of Genesis--authors who 
	are abbreviated to J, P, E, and R, for reasons we need not get into. 
	According to Richard Elliott Friedman, P is responsible for the first 
	creation story in Genesis, which runs from 1:1 to 2:3, and J is responsible 
	for the second one, which runs from 2:4b to 25 (Friedman 1996:246). When P 
	wrote his account, he was apparently familiar with, and in fact following a 
	synthesis of, J and E (JE) which contained the J creation story (Friedman 
	1996:188). But P was intended as an alternative to--not a supplement of--JE 
	(Friedman 1996:188-206). A later editor (R) fused together the JE and P 
	accounts while adding a few sentences of his own. If you have ever noticed 
	how uneasily Genesis 1:1-2:3 and Genesis 2:4-2:30 sit together, and how 
	different they sound from one another, this is why: they are, in fact, two 
	distinct creation stories--the former being written as a later alternative 
	to the latter.<a href="#5">[5]</a></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is, of course, always possible 
	with sufficient ingenuity to interpret any two passages of any two texts so 
	that they form a single narrative, and this is the standard strategy among 
	creationists with respect to the J and P creation stories. The question is 
	whether this is the <i>right</i> strategy. Supposing God wished to give us 
	the one true account of creation, and that it was an important matter for 
	salvation, why would He give what creationists consider the first part of 
	the story to J, and then, later on, give what creationists consider the 
	second part of the story to P--even though P was trying to write something 
	to replace JE--and then leave it to the human ingenuity of R to later fuse 
	the two accounts together as well as he could? If it were important to God 
	that intelligent people believe the creationist interpretation of Genesis, 
	wouldn't He give the entire account to a single person all at once (like to 
	Moses, as tradition has it)? Instead, we are left with a process that has 
	all of the hallmarks of human political maneuvering and none of the 
	appearance of inspiration by God.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The problem is exacerbated when we 
	notice that some of the statements in Genesis directly contradict modern 
	science beyond evolution. Genesis 1, for instance, places waters above the 
	stars, and has the Earth, grass, herbs, and fruit trees existing before both 
	the sun and the stars. Of course, if we have decided in advance that we are 
	willing to fit the words of Genesis to the findings of modern science by any 
	means possible, we can certainly make the fit. However, given that every 
	religious person denies the rationality of this method when people of <i>
	other</i> religions use it to demonstrate the truth of <i>their</i> holy 
	texts, the attitude that the method is reasonable when considering one's own 
	holy text constitutes a double standard. And if we refuse to embrace this 
	double standard, then we must concede that the Genesis creation stories have 
	the appearance of prescientific mythology. Therefore, again, if the creation 
	stories of Genesis were inspired by God in the first place, it is apparent 
	that they were not likely intended by Him to offer an entirely true account 
	of creation.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What, then, could their function be, 
	if they were inspired by God? I can only speculate. Perhaps they were meant 
	to give the ancient Jews another strong element of culture to rally to in 
	times of crisis. The Jewish people and culture have survived through 
	conditions in which countless others have been destroyed or assimilated, and 
	their shared creation myths may be part of the reason why. Perhaps these 
	myths have served their purpose, and were never meant to be collected into a 
	book and preached as infallible truth forever. I do not know--I am not a 
	theologian, and am personally content to accept the stories as myths in 
	which no god had a hand. But were I a believer, I would see some wisdom in 
	the old dictum that Scripture tells us how to go to Heaven, not how the 
	heavens go. I would recognize that I would still have faults and 
	shortcomings even if there had been no historical Adam and Eve to somehow 
	pass their own sinfulness to their descendants. I would recognize that the 
	arrival of a Messiah--or the return of a once-resurrected one--would be no 
	less possible even if God never said &quot;Let there be light.&quot; And I would 
	recognize, above all, that to insist upon binding God to one's first 
	impression of a text, disregarding His gift of reason, would be a sign of 
	arrogance rather than piety.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Conclusion</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To the rational believer, science is 
	a means of using the God-given gift of reason to understand how God has 
	actually done things. At one point in history, believers used to think that 
	the Sun revolved around the Earth, because they thought the Bible revealed 
	this infallible truth. Science, however, revealed that the Earth revolves 
	around the Sun. Although some believers resisted this discovery bitterly at 
	first, mistaking their own interpretations for the infallible word of God, 
	virtually all eventually came to understand that God simply could not have 
	set things up the way they had thought. While believers will find the 
	scientific view of the world enhanced and enriched by their religious 
	beliefs, it is sheer folly to insist upon a point of doctrine, grounded in 
	intuition and the authority of tradition, when scientific evidence indicates 
	its falsity. The time will hopefully come when the creationists, like the 
	geocentrists of old, set aside their dogmas and follow the light of reason 
	so that they, too, may learn the great wonders science teaches of the 
	universe, and--if He exists--of God.<a href="#6">[6]</a></font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Notes</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><a name="1">[1]</a>This article is a 
	revision of a pamphlet I wrote in 1994. I have rewritten it in part to 
	clarify my main line of argument and to offer new lines of argument and 
	exposition where my thinking has changed, but primarily to correct parts 
	where the tone of the pamphlet was overly hostile. The reader should 
	understand that I was reacting to creationists who painted evolutionists as 
	inveterate sinners and arrogant buffoons who hated God and loved sin, and 
	were responsible for every single evil, real or imaginary, that had ever 
	appeared on the face of the Earth. In light of such creationist excesses, I 
	hope I may be forgiven for retaliating in kind in my youthful exuberance. I 
	continue to believe that such creationists, who unfortunately still seem to 
	comprise a substantial proportion of the creationist vanguard, deserve every 
	insult I have thrown back at them. However, I have also come to realize that 
	the average creationists on the street are just like anyone else--people who 
	are simply trying their best to discover the truth and navigate an uncertain 
	world with the limited time and resources they have at their disposal. I do 
	not believe such people are stupid, even when they have been convinced by 
	self-important propagandists in their religious communities to reject sound 
	science, and I therefore regret that the earlier version tarred all 
	creationists with the same brush.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><a name="2">[2]</a> What follows is 
	not by any means intended to be a comprehensive catalogue of such 
	places--instead, it offers only a couple of representative examples, which 
	more or less make the point.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><a name="3">[3]</a> mRNA (messenger 
	RNA) is an intermediary which carries the instructions in DNA to ribosomes, 
	which together with tRNA (transfer DNA), constructs proteins according to 
	those instructions.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><a name="4">[4]</a> One example 
	among many: the 214th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) 
	passed a resolution the second article of which &quot;Reaffirms that there is no 
	contradiction between an evolutionary theory of human origins and the 
	doctrine of God as Creator&quot; (National Center for Science Education 2002:7).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><a name="5">[5]</a> Friedman's book 
	is highly recommended to those who want to understand who the different 
	writers were, what their different concerns and motivations were, and how 
	this is known.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><a name="6">[6]</a> This article is, 
	of course, brief, based as it is upon a mere pamphlet. I have not come even 
	close to listing all of the lines of evidence for evolution, nor have I 
	taken up creationist objections and replies. For the first, I would 
	recommend visiting the Talk.origins archive at
	<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org">www.talkorigins.org</a>. For the 
	second, I have done extensive work at
	<a href="http://www.vuletic.com/hume/cefec/">www.vuletic.com/hume/cefec/</a>.</font></p>
