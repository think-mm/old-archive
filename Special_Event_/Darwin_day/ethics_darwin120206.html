                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many years ago as a 
                    boy in India, I clambered out onto the terrace of my 
                    grandparents home cum optical showroom to try something 
                    based on a history lesson that we had had that day. We had 
                    been taught about Archimedes burning of the Persian fleet 
                    using solar reflectors and my teacher had told us that we 
                    could burn paper with a convex lens in a similar way. I had 
                    picked up a +10 Diopter lens out of a huge box in the shop 
                    and went out in the intense Madras heat, still in my school 
                    uniform, with a piece of cardboard trying to concentrate the 
                    suns rays through the lens onto the board and burn it. It 
                    took some time but I could see a black spot appear where the 
                    light was focused, and a slow wisp of smoke rose from there 
                    as the light burned through the board. It was a breathtaking 
                    moment as I tried to slowly write my name onto the board 
                    with light from the lens in my hand and as the first three 
                    letters formed, I could feel my pulse quickening with 
                    excitement at what I was doing.! That was when I heard my 
                    mother calling out from the kitchen, which adjoined the 
                    terrace, What are you doing in the sun? Without looking 
                    up, I shouted excitedly, Im writing my name on this board 
                    with a lens and sunlight. Before I knew what, she rushed up 
                    to me, grabbed my hand and made me stop. I looked up 
                    bewildered, about to ask what I had done wrong, when a 
                    stinging slap landed on my face. I remember her words that 
                    followed the slap very precisely, and, though a translation 
                    from Gujarati into English would bring the essence out , she 
                    told me The Sun god would be angry. With tears in my eyes, 
                    I told her, He would not have helped the Greeks win the war 
                    against the Persians if he was angry at his rays being 
                    used, ready for another slap which promptly came. I learned 
                    then that questioning myths could be dangerous, I would 
                    learn that doing this had cost many their lives.</font></p>

                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I did find myths 
                    fascinating, though. Every slap from a mother in India 
                    guarantees a big hug from a grandmother. And, my 
                    grandmothers way of calming us down was either to sing when 
                    we were very young, or, when we grew older, to tell us 
                    stories. We all had our favorites, from a wide repertoire 
                    that she was always happy to reproduce stories from, and I 
                    enjoyed her stories enough to study Literature at University 
                    many years later, but that is another story. When
                    <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/Darwin_day/calll_for_article280106.html">
                    Mukto Mona made a call for Darwin Day articles</a>, I could 
                    easily decide not to write on scientific issues for they are 
                    not what I have studied. Living in the USA, a country where 
                    a monumental battle between the Judaeo-Christian myths of 
                    creation (and their latest incarnation Intelligent Design) 
                    was brewing, it was not at all difficult to look at myths in 
                    different cultures as a subject.</font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a wealth of 
                    information on myths on hundreds of websites in different 
                    countries. As would be expected, there are those who look at 
                    myths as a kind of oral history that was written down 
                    recently in human civilization, and there are those to whom 
                    the myths mean only enjoyable fiction, period pieces from 
                    different eras that illustrate the development of human 
                    thought. As it was necessary to take myths in their 
                    essence, I decided to take them from the many mystical 
                    websites that profess them as fact. Taking interpretations 
                    from skeptical or independent authorities could leave a 
                    charge of atheist preconceptions at my door. And, websites 
                    that believed that these myths were predictions of a future, 
                    had them in greater detail and with more color anyway.</font></p>

                      the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the 
                      evening and the morning were the first day. And God said, 
                      Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and 
                      let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the 
                      firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the 
                      firmament from the waters which [were] above the 
                      firmament: and it was so. </font></p>

                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was obvious that 
                    our ancestors, the world over, had put considerable thought 
                    into trying to understand how the world and life had come 
                    about. And, early man, with an imagination unfettered by 
                    learning or science, had come up with what must have seemed 
                    logical to him considering his environment and 
                    circumstances. At a time when he lived in mud houses and 
                    relied on animal powered transportation, it must have seemed 
                    impossible for him to conceive of many things that we regard 
                    as routine today - flying, hence early mankind had to create 
                    angels that could fly at first and mythical flying devices, 
                    life was short due to disease and constant war and violence 
                    in a barbaric era, hence the suffering of day to day life 
                    was managed with stories of a happy afterlife. And, when it 
                    came to how he and all other creatures came to be, man had 
                    to create a divine creator who created everything that 
                    existed. He could not imagine what such a creator could be 
                    like, so he made sure that the crea! tor was someone in his 
                    own image. The Semitic religions explicitly said this, while 
                    Hinduism, and the religions of ancient Egypt, Greece and 
                    Rome did not say so in as many words, but had their own rich 
                    mythologies with gods as warring kings and courts, 
                    concubines, lackeys, jesters and all the trappings of the 
                    life of the ruling classes in their day.</font></p>

                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It took time for the 
                    myths to change - scriptures could not be altered as 
                    religions did not allow them to be. They were considered 
                    absolute and there was no question of even allowing their 
                    interpretation in some cases as several unfortunate heretics 
                    were to learn down the centuries. And yet, the progress in 
                    human knowledge proved unstoppable. James Huttons 
                    geological work and Charles Darwins research into evolution 
                    would soon provide, for the first time, an accurate 
                    description of how life had evolved, and, the quiet manner 
                    in which the scientists put their facts forward still 
                    terrified the daylights out of the religious bodies, the 
                    church in particular. The idea that a god did not create man 
                    in his own image minimized the importance of the church, 
                    and, indeed, exposed its wealth and power as that of an 
                    extortionist body which kept followers enslaved and 
                    constantly extracted money from them. It also told people, 
                    quite clearly, that the teachings of the religious book 
                    that! most people in the world followed, the Christian 
                    Bible, were incorrect from a factual perspective. Earlier, 
                    the Catholic church had taken on and forced Galileo to 
                    recant his heliocentric theory of the solar system. But now, 
                    in England, a nation that had grown immensely powerful in 
                    defying Rome and its Spanish and later French enforcers, was 
                    this new theory that no Christian church could do anything 
                    about. The Anglican church tried, initially, to confront 
                    Darwin and his fellow scientists with Bishop Sam Wilberforce 
                    asking Thomas Huxley whether he was descended from </font>

                    on his grandfather's side or his grandmother's side. 
                    Huxleys reply was scathing, I would rather be descended 
                    from an ape than from a cultivated man who used his gifts of 
                    culture and eloquence in the service of prejudice and 
                    falsehood.&quot; Newspaper cartoons of the time joked that Huxley 
                    had said that he would rather ! be an ape than a bishop. 
                    Never again would any church try to take the evolutionists 
                    on. They would use devious methods to try to squash 
                    evolution, first, spreading canards about Darwins supposed 
                    death bed conversion to Christianity, then trying to use 
                    legislation to prohibit teaching evolution, and, finally, 
                    coming out with the completely fraudulent religious theory 
                    of Intelligent Design and trying, again, to make this a 
                    mandatory subject of study in high school in the USA instead 
                    of evolution. And, the problem was not restricted to the 
                    church alone - several Arab countries, especially countries 
                    of the Gulf Co-operation Council ban the teaching of 
                    evolution in their schools, though, in a concession to 
                    foreign expats working there, they allow expat schools to 
                    teach the science.</font></font></p>

                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Though the last 
                    pope, John Paul II finally conceded that evolution was the 
                    right scientific theory and that the Biblical story of 
                    creation was wrong, and while his successor Benedict agrees 
                    with him, both have made a big show of talking about the 
                    moral aspect of the story of creation. As if, the 
                    torturing of millions of non Christians down history, 
                    something dictated by the churches in the past based on 
                    their interpretation of what was in the Bible was moral 
                    while the soft, careful scientific investigations of the 
                    biologists who have worked further to study the implications 
                    of Darwins theory and supporting evidence were immoral in 
                    some way. As if, the teaching of scientific fact as in the 
                    teaching of the theory of evolution was factually correct, 
                    but, somehow, immoral, this being an indirect way of 
                    showing acceptance of the science of evolution while hinting 
                    that its teaching needs to be tempered somewhat, political 
                    doublespeak at its most efficient. </font></p>
                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religion requires 
                    that its texts be followed in toto, that any criticism of 
                    them is heresy. Most scriptures have dire warnings against 
                    anyone who would want to go against them, and, very often, 
                    because of the absence of a heaven or hell, religions 
                    followers take matters into their hands to kill, torture or 
                    maim those who would oppose their fundamentalist views. In 
                    situations where they cannot, quite, do this, as in the 
                    educational arena of the USA, they attempt to use a 
                    legislative sledgehammer to smash advocates of science down. 
                    The fact is that scientific research is not stationary, it 
                    cannot be, because of the scientists need to work hard to 
                    correlate their theories and assumptions to new evidence 
                    that may come up. In this, the scientists zeal to learn, 
                    educate and inform is matched by the religious 
                    fundamentalists zeal to confuse, obfuscate and lie. A 
                    knowledge of how we came about by a random process confers 
                    great responsibility on us. A chance series of chemical r! 
                    eactions that created life mean that mistakes could be made 
                    that end it - it is the knowledge of evolution that inspires 
                    a respect for the earth, the environment that we live in, of 
                    life itself. Not for the scientist or the humanist are the 
                    fears of a mythical hell or the rewards of an equally 
                    mythical heaven necessary to lead a moral life. Since no 
                    god exists, the onus for living an ethical life is on the 
                    individual. And, since there is no heaven, there is 
                    compelling reason why we need to celebrate the beauty of 
                    life and enjoy the pleasures that derive from knowing how it 
                    came about. Darwin Day becomes, in effect, a reason to 
                    celebrate this knowledge vis a vis festivals that are driven 
                    by superstition, barbarity and forced ignorance.</font></p>
