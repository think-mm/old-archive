	Evolution is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass 
	on novel traits. <span lang="NO-BOK">In biology, such a trait or character 
	is a genetically inherited feature of organisms. A synonym trait is 
	phenotype from generation to generation, affecting the overall makeup of the 
	population and even leading to the emergence of
	<a style="color: #0099FF; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.wikimirror.com/Speciation">
	<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">new species</span></a></span>.
	<span lang="NO-BOK">Darwin and Wallace proposed that evolution occurs 
	because a heritable trait that increases an individual's chance of 
	successfully reproducing will become more common, by inheritance, from one 
	generation to the next, and likewise a heritable trait that decreases an 
	individual's chance of reproducing will become rarer</span>. The modern 
	evolutionary synthesis brings together Charles Darwin’s theory of the 
	evolution of species by natural selection with Mendel theory of genetics as 
	the basis for biological inheritance. Evolution, however, does not act in a 
	linear path towards a pre-defined goal — it only responds to various types 
	of adaptionary changes. Darwin did not mention the source of variations in 
	individual organisms, but observed that it seemed to be by chance. Later 
	work pinned much of this variation onto mutations in genetic material. Most 
	biologists believe that adaptation occurs through the accumulation of small 
	mutations. Mutations are permanent, transmissible changes to the genetic 
	material (usually DNA) of a cell. Mutations can be caused by copying errors 
	in the genetic material during cell division and by exposure to radiation, 
	chemicals, or viruses, or can occur deliberately under cellular control 
	during the processes such as meiosis. In multi-cellular organisms, mutations 
	can be subdivided into germ line mutations, which can be passed on to 
	progeny and somatic mutations.&nbsp; <span lang="NO-BOK">The DNA sequence of a 
	gene is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into the sequence of 
	a protein. Thus genes carry the blueprints to make proteins in the cell.
	</span>Every cell in the body has the same genetic information; what makes 
	cells, tissues and organs different is that different sets of genes are 
	turned on or expressed. More evidence has supported the view that 
	inheritance is not just about which genes we inherit but whether these are 
	switched on or off is a whole new frontier in biology. It raises questions 
	with huge implications, and means the investigation is on to find what sort 
	of environmental (such as gene-nutrients or other chemicals interactions) 
	effects can affect these switches in evolutionary processes. Such non-DNA 
	based forms of heritable variations have been reported to change the way in 
	which genes are expressed or maintained. This <span lang="NO-BOK">

	<span lang="EN-US" style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">
	epigenetic inheritance</span></a></span> is the transmission of information 
	from a cell or multi-cellular organism to its descendants without that 
	information being encoded in the nucleotide sequence of the gene. 
	Epigenetics aims to describe the inheritance of information on the basis of 
	gene expression in contrast to &quot;Genetics&quot;, which aims to describe the 
	inheritance of information on the basis of DNA sequence. Investigations 
	continue into whether these mechanisms allow for the production of specific 
	beneficial heritable variation in response to environmental signals (such as 
	nutrition, geographical locations of organisms, please see the skin colour 
	evolution article in MM).. If this were shown to be the case, then some 
	instances of evolution would lie outside of the typical Darwinian framework, 
	which avoids any connection between environmental signals and the production 
	of heritable variation. </p>

	Epigenetics, literally &quot;on&quot; genes, refers to all modifications to genes

	<span style="color: black">Mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance include

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 20.0pt" align="justify">
	<span lang="NO-BOK" style="color: black">About 60% of all human genes are 
	transcribed from a CG-rich promoter sequences (called CpG islands). Most of 
	these islands are unmethylated, which correlates with an active status for 
	the gene. CpG sites are clustered in CpG islands, which serve as promoter 
	regions for many genes.&nbsp; The bulk of DNA methylation in mammalian genomes is 
	found at the many repetitive sequences that litter our genomes. </span>
	Humans and other animals are susceptible to epigenetic changes because of an 
	evolutionary trait in which &quot;junk&quot; remnants of viral infections, called &quot;transposons,&quot; 
	inserted themselves randomly within the human and animal genomes. 
	Transposons use the gene replication machinery to reproduce themselves.
	<span lang="NO-BOK">Cells use methylation as a means to inactivate these 
	junk transposons and prevent their replication. Yet if the transposons have 
	inserted themselves in or near a functional gene, the gene can be 
	inadvertently methylated, too, thereby reducing its expression.
	<span style="color: black">It is critical to maintain this “junk DNA” in a 
	transcriptionally silent stage, and DNA methylation is a key process that 
	allows the cells to do just that. </span></span><span style="color: black">
	Evolutionary studies have revealed that silencing of repetitive “junk DNA” 
	is probably the primary function of epigenetics. &nbsp;</span>In fact, more than 
	40 percent of the human genome is comprised of transposons that are likely 
	to be methylated, so any genes positioned near them could be at risk for 
	inadvertent methylation. <span lang="NO-BOK" style="color: black">
	Epigenetics provides the missing link between the environment and the 
	development of diseases that goes beyond many of the subtle changes in DNA 
	that explain only a fraction of the diseases humans develop. </span>

	&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every cell in the body contains two copies of every one of our 
	genes encoded in DNA ladder, with one copy of each gene coming from our 
	mother and one copy from our father (except sex determining genes).
	<span lang="NO-BOK">Not every gene should be expressed in every cell of our 
	bodies. For example, we do not want our brain cells to make hemoglobin, the 
	protein required to carry oxygen around in our blood. Only those cells that 
	will ultimately make red blood cells should make hemoglobin. </span>If brain 
	cells contain an intact copy of the gene for the hemoglobin protein, why 
	don't brain cells also make hemoglobin?. Hence, these are processes that 
	control what gene is expressed in what cell type and these processes can 
	produce differences in activity of at least a million fold.
	<span lang="NO-BOK">To regulate the level at which any gene is expressed, 
	there are complex sets of regulatory proteins that bind to parts of the DNA 
	encoding each gene. In very complex organisms such as us, many control 
	factors have to be acting together to achieve the levels of power and 
	refinement of gene regulation needed. </span></p>

	In addition,&nbsp;&nbsp; with most genes, it probably does not matter that both copies 
	of the gene are both active. <span lang="NO-BOK">However, with a few genes, 
	only one copy is normally active. This could be the copy from the mother or 
	the father and which one it is that is active is specific for that 
	particular gene. </span>Some babies are born with abnormalities due to both 
	copies of the gene being active (Prader-Will syndrome, Angelman syndrome).
	<span lang="NO-BOK">This has been shown to be due to a failure in the 
	establishment of the normal pattern of methyl group tags that blocks the 
	activity of one of the copies of the gene. In addition, there is evidence 
	that, in some cancers, genes that control proliferation of cells can be 
	inactivated by abnormal addition of methyl group tags, resulting in 
	uncontrolled cell division. Because they change how genes can interact with 
	the cell's transcriptional machinery, epigenetic modifications, or &quot;marks,&quot; 
	generally turn genes on or off, allowing or preventing the gene from being 
	used to make a protein. On the other hand, mutations and bigger changes in 
	the DNA sequence (like insertions or deletions) change not only the sequence 
	of the DNA and RNA, but may affect the sequence of the protein as well. 
	Mutations in the sequence can prevent a gene from being recognized, 
	amounting to its being turned off, but only if the mutations affect specific 
	regions of the DNA. There are different kinds of epigenetic &quot;marks,&quot; 
	chemical additions to the genetic sequence. The addition of methyl groups to 
	the DNA backbone is used on some genes to distinguish the gene copy 
	inherited from the father and that inherited from the mother. In this 
	situation, known as &quot;imprinting,&quot; the marks both distinguish the gene copies 
	and tell the cell which copy to use to make proteins.&nbsp; </span></p>

	Imprinted genes do not rely on traditional laws of Mendelian genetics, which 
	describe the inheritance of traits as either dominant or recessive.
	<span lang="NO-BOK">In Mendelian genetics, both parental copies are equally 
	likely to contribute to the outcome. The impact of an imprinted gene copy, 
	however, depends only on which parent it was inherited from. For some 
	imprinted genes, the cell only uses the copy from the mother to make 
	proteins, and for others only that from the father.&nbsp; Imprinting in genetics 
	is not new, but it is gaining visibility as it is linked to more diseases 
	and conditions that affect humans. Centuries ago, mule breeders in Iraq 
	noted that crossing a male horse and a female donkey created a different 
	animal (Hinny) than breeding a female horse and a male donkey (Mule). In the 
	modern scientific era, however, the initial evidence for parent-of-origin 
	effects in genetics didn't appear until the mid 1950s or so. Then, in the 
	mid 1980s, scientists studying mice discovered that inheritance of genetic 
	material from both a male and a female parent was required for normal 
	development. The experiments also revealed that the resulting abnormalities 
	changed depending on whether the inherited genetic material was all male in 
	origin or all female. </span>Around the same time, others discovered that 
	the effects of some transgenes in mice differed when they were passed from 
	the male or female parent. <span lang="NO-BOK">The first naturally occurring 
	example of an imprinted gene was the discovery of imprinting in the IGF-2 
	gene in mice in 1991, and currently about 70 imprinted genes have been 
	identified in mice and humans.<i>&nbsp; </i><span style="color: black">Imprinted 
	genes, unlike most other genes, are expressed only from one allele in a 
	strict parent-of-origin manner. Hence, some genes are only expressed from 
	the allele inherited from the mother, while the others are solely expressed 
	from the allele inherited from the father. This strange mode of inheritance 
	explains why the maternal and paternal genomes, while genetically almost 
	identical, are epigenetically very different. </span></span>

	placenta. Many maternally expressed genes tend to do just the opposite. 
	These observations are well explained in the context of the “the battle of 
	the sexes”, which explains the evolution of imprinting in mammals with <i>in 
	utero</i> development as a tug of war between both sexes. The premise of the 
	theory is that each sex is trying to maximize its reproductive potential. 
	The trick, however, is that females are the sole provider of nutrients for 
	the growth of the fetus during gestation. Taking advantage of this fact, 
	males try to favor the transfer of nutrients from the mother to their 
	offspring to ensure the birth of “healthy babies”, even if this comes at the 
	expense of the mother’s future reproductive fitness. Females, on the other 
	hand, try to tip the balance back to relieve some of the burden placed on 
	them and increase their future reproductive fitness while providing just the 
	right amount of nutrients to the fetus. Today, establishing this delicate

	<span lang="EN">Pembrey et al showed that early paternal smoking was 
	associated with greater BMI at 9 years of age in sons, but not in daughters. 
	This prompted them to return to the records of the 1890, 1905 and 1920 
	cohorts from Overkalix, Sweden. Previously, they reported an association of 
	ancestral food supply with longevity<sup> </sup>and with cardiovascular and 
	diabetic mortality. Re-analysis showed that the paternal grandfathers' food 
	supply during mid childhood was linked to the mortality risk ratio of 
	grandsons, but not granddaughters. The study suggested that in humans, a 
	one-off environmental event could influence phenotype for more than one 
	generation in a sex-specific way. If true, these findings implied a novel 
	kind of transgenerational inheritance, an idea strengthened by recent 
	studies in animal systems. The molecular basis for these apparently 
	nongenetic transgeneration effects is not known. One hypothesis is that it 
	involves epigenetics. However, there is increasing evidence that some parts 
	of the genome are not cleared leading to transgenerational inheritance of 
	epigenetic state in these specific parts, termed transgenerational 
	epigenetic inheritance.<sup> </sup>Their intriguing finding of 
	transgenerational effects that are sex-specific, is also not without 
	precedent in animal systems. It has been known for some time that transient 
	exposure of pregnant female rats to vinclozolin, a fungicide used in the 
	wine industry, can cause reproductive abnormalities in male offspring. A 
	recent study<sup> </sup>has shown that the reproductive abnormalities, 
	including reduced sperm count and sperm motility, are detected in nearly all 
	male offspring for at least four generations. The effect could not be passed 
	through female subjects; female siblings of affected males in the F2 
	generation, when mated with untreated controls, produced male offspring with 
	normal fertility.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN">It is possible that the environmental toxins cause 
	epigenetic changes to the DNA in the developing germ line of the male 
	embryos, and that this change is maintained and carried along with the sperm 
	to the next generation. However a role for the Y chromosome, similar to that 
	postulated by Pembrey, remains a possibility. Whether this is a new kind of 
	genetic event, which is Y-specific, or an epigenetic event that is 
	sperm-specific, or something else altogether, remains unclear. From a public 
	health point of view, what makes the Pembrey study particularly interesting 
	is that it argues that exposure in the male can affect the development and 
	health of males for at least two generations, and this is rarely, if ever 
	considered. Furthermore, these findings may go some way toward shifting the 
	balance of responsibility for the unborn, away from the mother to the

	and their role in development, evolution and adaptation and on small 
	molecules (nutrients, drugs, toxins) that reverse epigenetic 
	activation/inactivation should provide us with the means to &quot;unlock&quot; 
	silenced (enhanced) genes, and to &quot;convert&quot; the obsolete human thrifty 
	genotype into a &quot;squandering&quot; phenotype.</span></p>
