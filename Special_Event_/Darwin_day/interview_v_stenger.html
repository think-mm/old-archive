	Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Hawaii and adjunct 
	professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado. He is the author of 
	five published books, with two more due shortly. He is also the President of

	<p align="justify"><b>MM</b> :<b> </b><font face="Verdana">Hi Vic, we 
	welcome you from Mukto-Mona, which is an Internet congregation of society 
	conscious freethinkers, rationalists, skeptics, atheists &amp; humanists of 
	mainly Bengali and South Asian descent scattered across the globe. First, We 
    like to thank you for your on going support for Mukto-Mona over the years. Though 
	today's interview is mainly prepared to celebrate the upcoming Darwin Day, we 
	must say that we are very appreciative about your scholarly work on 
	debunking theistic interpretation of creation, myths, bad science and 
	pseudoscience of various kinds.</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><br>
		<b>Vic Stenger :</b> Thanks to Mukto-Mona and wishing you a happy Darwin 
		day. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><br>
	<b>MM</b> :<b> </b><font face="Verdana">Why do you think we need to create 
	awareness about Evolution among lay people and celebrate Darwin Day? Is it 
	more necessary in today's world then ever before?</font> </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><b>Vic Stenger : </b>I don't think it's any more 
		necessary today that it was when it first appeared in 1859. It may be 
		the most revolutionary idea in history--that humanity developed by a 
		series of mindless accidents. I don't see how anyone who believes that 
		humans are special creations, made &quot;in the image of God,&quot; can at the 
		same time accept Darwinian evolution.<br>
		<br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><b>MM</b> : <font face="Verdana">Richard Dawkins has said 
	in one of interviews that 40% of British pople believe in 'God' where as the 
	figure is 95% in US. Why America has been way more conservative about 
	religion than the Europeans? Is there a political, social or historical 
	reason behind it? </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><b>Vic Stenger : </b>Many reasons have been put 
		forth. But I think one reason for the current dominance of conservatives 
		in America is money. They have huge amounts of it and are able to market 
		their product far more effectively than their opposition. And, they are 
		marketing it to a public that is largely ignorant of science (as well as 
		everything else of an intellectual nature) and incapable of critical 
		thinking.<br>
		<br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><b>MM</b> : <font face="Verdana">Many argue that a 
	scientist's position should be agnosticism, as &quot;we don't know everything&quot; 
	especially about the final &quot;mystery&quot; of the Universe. But you seemed to take 
	a definite position of Atheism (like Richard Dawkins), as if you are pretty 
	sure about &quot;nonexistence&quot; of God. How scientific is your ground? </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><b>Vic Stenger : </b>Proof in science is not the same 
		as proof in logic or mathematics. In science, an assertion is considered 
		proved when the evidence in support of it is so strong that the opposite 
		assertion is ruled out beyond a reasonable doubt. The 
		Judeo-Christian-Islamic God plays such an important role in the world 
		that he should have been detected by now. Instead there is not only no 
		evidence for such a God,
		<a href="../../Articles/vstenger/scientific_case_god150106.html">there is 
		ample evidence against him</a>. The world looks just like it should be 
		expected to look in the absence of God. I think this is proper 
		science--looking at the data.<br>
		<br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><b>MM</b> : <font face="Verdana">In your last book &quot;Has 
	Science Found God?&quot; you tried to provide a critique of contemporary claims 
	that science supports the existence of God and found them inadequate. 
	However, in your upcoming book, &quot;God: The Failed Hypothesis&quot;, you seem to 
	claim that science makes a strong case against the existence a God. But many 
	argue that God itself is not a very well-defined term, and it suffers from 
	many logical contradictions. So, how much &quot;scientific&quot; is your position in 
	this case?</font> </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><b>Vic Stenger :</b>I do not try to disprove every 
		conceivable God. I hypothesize a God with certain attributes, then look 
		for the observable consequences of those attributes. When those 
		consequences are not seen, then the hypothesis fails. When all put 
		together, the 
		<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Godless/Fail.pdf">Judeo-Christian-Islamic God hypothesis fails</a>.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><b>MM</b> : <font face="Verdana">In some of your books 
	you relied on multiverse hypothesis, even though it still remains in the 
	realm of speculation. How are you so sure about that?</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><br>
		<b>Vic Stenger : </b>I have not relied solely on multiple universes for 
		any of my arguments. 
		<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/vstenger/anthro_philo.pdfhttp:/www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/vstenger/anthro_philo.pdf">The fine tuning (anthropic principle) argument 
		fails</a> independent of multiple universes. It is OK to speculate in 
		science, as long as the speculation is based on well-established 
		theories.&nbsp;Multiple universes follow as a consequence in a number of 
		cosmological theories. Someone who makes an argument based on the 
		assumed existence of a single universe has the burden of proving that 
		multiple universes do not exist. Since nothing we know forbids them, he 
		is&nbsp;violating Occam's razor by introducing more hypotheses (the added 
		hypothesis of a single universe) than are required by the data.<br>
		<br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><b>MM</b> : <font face="Verdana">Do you think more 
	scientists need to speak out against pseudo-science, religion, paranormal 
	and other superstition just like you did? Why are there very few scientists 
	talking about these issues?</font> </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><b>Vic Stenger : </b>It would help. Most scientists 
		just think about their own research and worry about funding. It's a 
		full-time job, so if their work is not threatened they stay out of it.<br>
		<br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><b>MM</b> : <font face="Verdana">ID has been defeated in 
	court in Dover, Pennsylvania; yet you seem to disagree with some of the 
	statements made by Judge John E. Jones III. Will you kindly explain your 
	position here?</font><br>
	<br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><b>Vic Stenger : </b>The
		<a href="supernatural_science300106.htm">judge went further than 
		necessary</a> in his decision. Once it was proved that the Board 
		violated the separation of church and state, the case against it was 
		made. But the judge felt compelled to also rule that ID is not science. 
		This forced him to define science, which no philosophers of science or 
		scientists have done to everyone's satisfaction. As part of his 
		definition he limited science to natural causes and phenomena, which 
		agreed with the positions of both sides and, in particular, the position 
		of spokesmen for the scientific community. They thus have played right 
		into the hands of those who claim science has a dogmatic insistence on 
		natural or material causes. This position is both unnecessary and false. 
		Scientists can and do study phenomena such as prayer that may have 
		supernatural implications. </p>

	again for being with us. </font></p>
