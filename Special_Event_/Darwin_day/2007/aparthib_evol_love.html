					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the 
					publication of The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man 
					by Charles Darwin, biologists have come a long way in their 
					quest to understand human behaviour, building up on Darwin's 
					original ideas and revising/perfecting it with new evidences 
					and observations. Age old questions what is love?, where do 
					human
					<a href="../../../Articles/aparthib/evolutionary_morality.html">
					morality</a> stem from etc are now understood reasonable 
					well thanks to the research of sociobiologists and 
					evolutionary psychologists,specially in the last two decades 
					of 20th century. Their work points to an entire gamut of 
					human emotions being rooted in our evolutionary history. 
					Love, like all other human emotions is also rooted in the 
					evolutionry history. It should be noted that evolutionary 
					psychologists use the term love and sex interchangeably to 
					mean the feeling of romantic attractions, courtship, mating 
					and and the act of sex between opposite sexes. The term love 
					and sex will be used interchangeably in this greater sense 
					throughout this writeup. This writeup is by no means a 
					scholarly or a scientific essay. Instead my aim is to quote 
					some of the scientists and science authors (in books and TV 
					shows) with my annotations to provoke the readers to read up 
					on these fascinating issues further. No attempt is made to 
					organize or structure it in any way. Needless to say the 
					findings of Evolutionary Psychology (EVP) will sound 
					shocking to many. But science is about truth, not about 
					political correctness.That's how it has to be seen. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A slew of well 
					written books and essays have been written by many experts 
					in evolutionary psychology on this topic. The works of David 
					Buss, Helen Fisher, Geoffrey Miller, Robin Baker and many 
					others are worth mentioning. TV shows like the Science of 
					Sex (TLC), Gender Wars (Desmond Morris) etc are also quite 
					illuminating. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is the root 
					origin of love? The surprising but simple answer is the urge 
					for the survival of genes. And what is the basis of the 
					survial of the genes? To put it rhetorically, its the laws 
					of Physics (stupid). We may not realize this origin when 
					reading or listening to a beautiful love poem or song. To 
					quote from &quot;Mystery Dance: On the Evolution of Human 
					Sexuality&quot; by Margulis and Sagan('91): </font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<i><font face="Verdana">All our desires, passions etc, 
						reflect inanimate tendencies already implicit before 
						life in the second law of Thermodynamics. Sexual 
						reproducers, living beings making more of them - selves, 
						achieve not only biological ends, but those of physics 
						as well. p-46: </font>
					</blockquote>
					</i>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The survival of 
					genes require the physical survial of an animal to reach 
					reproductive to be able to choose a mate to pass off the 
					gene to the offspring. It is the send step that lies at the 
					origin of love, courtship of love to be precise. Darwin 
					touched this aspect in the idea of sexual selection in the 
					Descent of Man. But this idea find its fullest exposition in 
					modern evolutionary psychology(EVP). Males and females 
					choosing each other for specific attributes drove, through 
					sexual selection the evolution of such human features as 
					brain size increases, sexual organ characteristics and human 
					behaviors in general. Many of modern courtship techniques 
					have parallels in evolution, like the long tailbones of 
					peacocks, which have grown large to attract peahens, since 
					peahens in turn were attracted by long tails of peacocks. To 
					quote Margulis and Sagan: </font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<i><font face="Verdana">Technology, civilization cannot 
						distance us from our animal selves, but instead 
						accentuate them. Trendy glasses, epaulets etc are 
						similar to tailbones of peacocks (p-170) </font>
					</blockquote>
					</i>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As revolting as it 
					may sound, infidelity(cheating) in love, jealousy,rape etc 
					are also rooted in evolution and evolutionary psychologists 
					deal with these topics too in their research. In their book 
					&quot;The Natural History of Rape&quot; Thornbull and Palmer explains 
					the origin of rape as an evolutionary adaptive mechanism to 
					maximize gene propagation. Quite predictably they evoked 
					strong reactions form critics. But most of their critics 
					committed the Is-Ought logical fallacy, believing that just 
					because something has been classified as &quot;natural,&quot; it must 
					also have been implied as morally okay. But Thornbull and 
					Palmer did not imply that. This linking of rape to 
					evolutionary adaptation is cited on page 45 of the book 
					&quot;Sexing the brain&quot; by neurobiologist Lesley Rogers quoting 
					another biologist Matt Ridley:&quot;Rape was evolutionarily 
					adaptive&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Cheating in love is 
					also evolutionarily rooted. Cheating is in our genes, 
					narrates Ms. Kathleen Turner in The Science of Sex(TLC). So 
					it must have evolutionary advantage in our past. With huge 
					quantity of sperms in men, its to their evolutionary 
					interest to father as many children as possible. With one 
					egg per month women has less advantage in infidelity, yet it 
					does exist, so must have some advantage. More resources for 
					her child through the extra mate is the explanation for 
					female infidelity. It provided genetic advantages to both 
					males and females in evolutionary past (and still does 
					today). This fact of evolution is also cited in Joann 
					Ellison Rodgers' tome: &quot;Sex: A Natural History&quot; on page 215:
					</font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<i><font face="Verdana">Deception appears to be 
						necessary and therefore built into our sexual biology
						</font>
					</blockquote>
					</i><font face="Verdana">Again not to confuse IS with OUGHT. 
					What nature prescribes, nature also proscribes (via 
					conflicting urges). It is this conflicting forces (or 
					instincts) within humans that act as the stabilizing force 
					in evolution. </font>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Curiously, 
					Evolutionary Biologists have found a correlation between 
					degree of female infidelity with the quantity of sperm 
					(testicle size) of the males of a species. Humans lie 
					between the two extremes of Gorilla (least likely to cheat, 
					small testes) and Chimpanzee (most likely to mate with 
					multiple partners, largest testes). </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This correlation has 
					been cited in the TLC TV show as well as on page-339 of 
					&quot;Sex: A Natural History&quot;: </font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<i><font face="Verdana">&quot;Men's relatively large testes 
						are a solid evidence that women in evolutionary history 
						were promiscuous&quot; </font>
					</blockquote>
					</i>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another insight from 
					EVP is that humans are not evolutionarily adapted for strict 
					monogamy. As biologist Meredith Small points out on p-17 in 
					her book &quot;What's Love got to do with it&quot; that women, as well 
					as men, might not be biologically designed for monogamy 
					citing that only 14% of the 200 species among primates are 
					monogamous. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana">In her book &quot;The Anatomy of Love&quot; 
					Helen Fisher writes: </font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<i><font face="Verdana">&quot;From a darwinian perspective, 
						however, there were advantages to serial monogamy 
						millenia ago&quot;. From a darwinian perspective, having 
						children with more than one partners often make genetic 
						sense&quot; (p-159). </font>
					</blockquote>
					</i>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Polygamy is also 
					roughly correlated with male to female body size ratio, 
					which in case humans suggest a moderate polygamic tendency, 
					as cited by Meredith Small (What's Love got to do with it) 
					on page 20: Women are 80% of men physically,suggesting mild 
					polygamy. Rodgers also mention this correlation on page-338 
					of her book. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana">All this shows that humans are at 
					least not designed for strict monogamy or strict harem 
					system either. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jealousy also is 
					evolutionary in origin. As David Buss points out in his book 
					&quot;The Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy Is Necessary in Love 
					and Sex&quot; and also in the TLC show on Science of Sex that we 
					are here because our ancestors were jealous. Those who were 
					not did not leave any descendents. Needless to say that does 
					not mean that TODAY EVERYONE has to be jealous. Apart from 
					the fact that evolutionary traits are statistical, the 
					evolutionary needs also change slowly over time as part of 
					evolution. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An important element 
					in sexual selection is body odor. Each of us have unique 
					odor like fingerprint, which serves as fitness marker in 
					evolutionary paradigm. Margulis and Sagan mentions that on 
					pages 179-80. They also mention body odor as a sign of 
					healthy immune systems. They cite an experiment of sniffing 
					effect of sweaty male T- shirts by women. As the 
					evolutionary root of that they mention that our mammalian 
					ancestors were nocturnal, so had to depend on sniffing as 
					primary mate selection means. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana">In the &quot;Anatomy of Love&quot;, page-42, 
					Helen Fisher writes: </font></p>
					<blockquote>
						<i><font face="Verdana">Male essence(sweat) helps 
						maintain regularity of female menstrual cycle. Hence 
						females's (unconscious) attraction to male smell may be 
						evolutionarily caused. The reason males now use 
						deodorants and women prefer them may be culturally 
						conditioned by the aggressive selling/ advertizing of 
						producers and making perspiration is equaled to 
						uncleanliness. </font>
					</blockquote>
					</i><font face="Verdana">Joann Rodgers also mentions in her 
					book on page-251 that women prefer men with the most 
					dissimilar MHC genes (as observed through sniffing T-shirts 
					soaked in armpit). Needless to say that these preferences 
					are instinctually hardwired by evolution, not by conscious 
					choice. </font>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Scientists have 
					identified the hormone that carries this distinct odor in 
					men (generically called pheromones) called androsterone and 
					the detectors for that odor in women called VNO (Vomeronasal 
					organ). This confirms that humans also use sniffing (but in 
					a much more subtle way) like animals to check out their 
					mates instinctively via their VNO. It should be pointed out 
					that the pheromone sniffing is not consciously done, the 
					usual stinking male sweat is not due to the male pheromone 
					in his sweat, but due to the bacterial degradation in his 
					sweat that is exposed to the atmosphere for some time. That 
					smell is conscious and made through the usual olfactory 
					nerve, the instinctual smelling of pheronome in sweat is 
					through VNO bypassing the olfactory nerve. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why do women have 
					cryptic estrus (Concealed ovulation)? The reason cited for 
					that by Margulis and Sagan on p-197 of their book is that it 
					helped male bonding with their women in the evolutionary 
					past. The TLC series &quot;The Science of Sex&quot; narrated by 
					actress Kathleen Turner also mentions that concealed 
					ovulation helped pair bonding in our evolutionary past. 
					Basically by hiding when she is infertile she forced the man 
					to be always around her because he feared she would be 
					mating with another man and sire child with him, and him 
					having to take care of that child. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That the feeling of 
					love is triggered by some features in males and females 
					which is perceived as beauty or sexiness is obvious to 
					anyone. But these markers are programmed by evolution as 
					markers of some fitness. This is the finding of evolutionary 
					psychologists. The work of Devandra Singh of UT Austin 
					pointing to Waist to hip ratio as an evolutionary marker for 
					healthy pregnancy is cited by Rodgers. Men are sexually 
					attracted to low waist-to-hip ratios in females, and a low 
					female waist-to-hip ratio really correlates with youth, 
					fertility, and health. On page 148 of &quot;Why We Feel? The 
					Science of Emotions&quot; Evol. Psychologist Victor Johnston 
					mentions that a hip/waist ratio of 0.7 signifies an ideal 
					androgen/estrogen ratio required for fertility in women. So 
					is lip-fullness. So the perception of beauty and thus sexual 
					attraction is directly correlated with female fertility. For 
					men one fitness marker is facial symmetry, thus women tend 
					to prefer men with facial symmetry. Reference to this can be 
					found on p-49-58 in Lesley Rogers' &quot;Sexing the brain&quot; 
					quoting Randy Thornhill's theory of beauty and symmetry vs. 
					fertility. In this context fitness should be understood as 
					genetic fitness,good genes in simple terms. Again just to 
					remind these preferences are instinctual and thus women will 
					not be consciously aware of this. </font></p>

					aesthetic sense</a>, humor,athletic ability, and 
					intellectual activity has all been identified by some 
					evolutionary psychologists as the product of sexual 
					selection. In fact they attribute the relatively large size 
					of human brain to sexual selection pressure. Costly organs 
					(brain consumes a lot of heat) serve as fitness markers. The 
					pioneering work in this are is by Geoffrey Miller who has 
					written a highly readable book titled &quot;The Mating Mind: How 
					Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature&quot;. He 
					contends that women view these abilities as markers of 
					genetic fitness in men and that women's brain has also 
					evolved to be able to discriminate these abilities in men. 
					According to him, since all those qualities do not give them 
					an obvious survival benefit, they must have provided and 
					continue to provide a reproductive advantage to have 
					survived and thrived. &quot;Romantic&quot; behavior like the making of 
					complex art couldn't have aided our ancestors find more food 
					or avoid predators. Thus it might have helped to serve as a 
					marker of fitness of primitive men to primitive women with 
					whom they wanted to mate. Of course the the romantic 
					behaviours in primitive time were also primitive, and has 
					evolved to its modern form. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When it comes to 
					love and sex mention must be made about the battle of the 
					sexes and mate competition. Biologists have traced these to 
					sperms. Robin Baker has done detailed study of how sperms 
					compete with each other to fertilize eggs. That competition 
					is a sort of miniature version of the competition among 
					males for a mate. Matt Ridley in his book &quot;Red Queen&quot; traces 
					the origin of the battle BETWEEN the sexes (and the 
					resolution thereof) to the evolutionary battle between male 
					and female gametes that led to sex differentiation in the 
					first place. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have glossed over 
					these fascinating new horizons of evolutionary psychology, 
					which has taken up the most daunting task of humans trying 
					to understand humans. Why are we the way we are. It is a 
					dynamic new area of research and is sure to unravel age old 
					mysteries of human behaviour nothwithstanding the stiff 
					resistance from the PC police. </font></p>
