					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
					It can be hard to imagine how two centuries ago erudite men 
					were so beguiled by the teachings of the Old Testament, and 
					fearful of the preachers who clung to ageing doctrines, that 
					few dared publicly challenge the orthodoxy. The mythologies 
					of Genesis were not recognised as the fabrication of 
					storytellers: God created Man and Womanand the remainder of 
					mankind (and their archaeological traces) resulted. Noahs 
					contribution seemed so pivotal that events in the 
					archaeological record were classified as antediluvian, 
					diluvian and postdiluvian. This essay explores how a uniform 
					acceptance of these fables, for so long held to be truths, 
					came to be disputed, and then so quickly overthrown that 
					learned opinion as to human antiquity switched polarity in 
					the space of a few years. It sets in historical context the 
					tremendous advances in understanding the origins of life and 
					humans that Charles Darwins erudition initiated. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>PRELUDE</b><br>
					For centuries the renaissance of European scholarship 
					followed an encouraging but slow advance in the face of 
					religious conservatism. The doctrines of the Church were 
					unassailable. To disagree was heresy. Galileo was denounced, 
					but events proved that he and Copernicus were right: our 
					planet does revolve about the sun; Earth is not the centre 
					of the universe. The Church was unwilling to fit 
					disconcerting findings into its traditional framework. The 
					Bible was fact, Genesis was fact, the flood was fact. The 
					seventeenth-century Irish Archbishop James Ussher calculated 
					the year of the creation of man as 4004 BC, which he 
					achieved by analysing lines of descent from Adam. By the 
					same token the flood was assigned to the year 2501 BC and 
					for two centuries academics and philosophers believed this, 
					having been indoctrinated as children into believing the 
					fables. Although this did little harm to invention, 
					engineering, mathematics, physics and botany which 
					progressed steadily under leading figures like Leonardo, 
					Newton, Fourier and Linnaeus, the Churchs attitude neutered 
					astronomy, geology, medicine and prehistory. Some scientists 
					may have doubted, but outwardly they conformed. Outspoken 
					atheists, few in number, were ridiculed, persecuted or 
					tormentedor at best ignored. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>PROGRESS</b><br>
					Against this background, by the end of the 18th century, 
					fitful beginnings, towards realising there had been a truly 
					long prehistoric period, were afoot. We may cite Johann 
					Esper who discovered in the German Jura in 1771 human bones 
					in association with extinct animals like cave bear. And John 
					Frere, in 1797, who found hand-axes alongside extinct animal 
					bones 12 feet below the ground in undisturbed strata at 
					Hoxne, Suffolk, and said they belonged to a remote 
					stone-using period even beyond that of the present world 
					(Daniels 1950). John MacEnery, excavating in Kents Cavern, 
					Torquay, in the 1820s, recognised the antiquity of hand-axes 
					found with ancient animal remains, but peer-group pressure 
					prevented publication. Godwin Austen continued this work in 
					1840 and soon wrote that the bones of the cave-mammals and 
					the works of man must have been introduced into the cave 
					before the floor of the stalagmite had been formed (Daniels 
					1950, Bibby 1957). Pierre Tournal, about 1826-1834, was 
					uncovering cave deposits that he claimed could not be linked 
					to any flood, and numerous discoveries and precocious ideas 
					by others can be given. In geology, there were parallel 
					developments, as William Smith (1769- 1839) and Charles 
					Lyell (1797-1875) led the way with concepts of superposition 
					of strata and the law of uniformitarianism initiated by 
					James Hutton (1726-1797). This culminated in Lyells 1830 
					classic The Principles of Geology, subtitled An attempt to 
					explain the former changes of the Earths surface by 
					reference to causes now in operation. Stratified deposits, 
					if due to processes that are even now continuing, imply an 
					age for Earth far greater than any that Biblical chronology 
					assured. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>THE TURNING POINT</b><br>
					By the 1850s the dogged persistence of two men helped turn 
					the tide in favour of human antiquity: Jacques Boucher de 
					Perthes (1788-1868) in France and William Pengelly 
					(1812-1894) in England.<br>
					Boucher de Perthes found strong proof indicating a great age 
					for early man, in deep strata near Abbeville in 1832, and in 
					the course of 20 years made further discoveries which he 
					described and published against a tide of scepticism. A 
					turning point was 1854. An authoritative sceptic Dr Rigollet, 
					who had the aim of proving him wrong, excavated at the new 
					site of St Acheul near Amiens and found so many specimens of 
					stone axes and other tools in deep undisturbed strata that 
					he changed his views and announced that Boucher de Perthes 
					had been right after all. Antiquaries and geologists 
					descended on Acheul and Abbeville, including a team from 
					England in 1859.<br>
					In England William Pengelly set to work in Kents Cavern and 
					soon agreed that his conscientious predecessors had been 
					correct all the while, but his newly-published work of 1846 
					met with similar disdain. Nonetheless, despite continuing 
					scepticism there was rising interest in the extreme age 
					being argued for such remains. In 1858 a test became 
					possible at a virgin site, a cave near Brixham in South 
					Devon. Pengelly would excavate, and a committee chosen by 
					the Royal Society and Geological Society would supervise. 
					Soon a stalagmite floor was uncovered, and embedded within 
					and beneath it were bones of cave lion, cave bear, hyena, 
					mammoth, rhinoceros and reindeer, together with flint tools 
					of human workmanship. As for geological research, although 
					fossils in the rocks were now best explained as extinct life 
					forms from a hugely remote past, this meant nothing to 
					Biblical supporters. Either God was responsible, or the 
					flood carried them there. But scientists who carefully 
					documented facts, and hypothesised and tested by experiment, 
					were acquiring an independence of thought unimpaired by 
					ecclesiastical dogma.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
					Here is a fitting truth from a lecture I heard Professor 
					Thomas Gold, F.R.S. give in 1989: It often takes a long 
					time for new ideas, new concepts, new explanations to gain 
					acceptance in science, even when they accord far better with 
					the facts as known and replace what is demonstrably wrong. A 
					long-established viewpointthe orthodoxycan maintain itself 
					against the clearest disproof. Support for the orthodoxy is 
					readily accepted, disproof is often ignored . . . and the 
					innovator shunned. GOLD (1989). Abstract from Lecture 
					entitled The Inertia of Scientific Thought, part of a 
					two-day conference on Science and the Unexpected. IBM, 
					London. The context of this appraisal was science but it 
					applies to all scholarship past and present including 
					theology and archaeology, and thereby explains the 
					psychology of the antiquity-of-man critics. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By 1859 the 
					best-read scientists were mentally prepared for the 
					explosion that erupted in November that year with the 
					publication of Charles Darwins research. Others had 
					anticipated ideas regarding evolution but Charles Darwin 
					(1809-1882) catalysed an expectant atmosphere by explaining 
					in meticulous detail how evolution operated, and on such 
					vast time scales.<br>
					As a youth he was sent to Cambridge expecting to take holy 
					orders, but soon after getting his degree in 1831 he joined 
					the Beagle as ships naturalist. His five years of 
					collecting and 20 years of analysing would come to 
					revolutionise scientific judgement, and eventually religious 
					opinion. He was also influenced by Thomas Malthus concept 
					of competition through popular pressure published in 1798 
					as An Essay on the Principle of Population. Later, Charles 
					Darwins son quoted his fathers changing views on 
					Christianity thus: Disbelief crept over me at a very slow 
					rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I 
					felt no distress. He had become a quiet agnostic or atheist 
					(Francis Darwin 1887). His convictions liberated, his 
					research ideas would free others, to the lasting benefit of 
					archaeological prehistory and the sciences. Encouraged by 
					recent progress in archaeology and geology it was time for 
					Darwin to announce his findings. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Origin of 
					Species by Means of Natural Selection sold out its first 
					edition of 1250 copies on the first day. In 1860 came the 
					renowned confrontation at Oxford between Bishop Wilberforce 
					and the Darwinian Thomas Huxley. Human culture was now seen 
					as a progression, not just of biological evolution but of 
					social and cultural evolution. C. J. Thomsens Three Age 
					System, published in Danish in 1836 and in English in 1848, 
					was proving to be a valuable resource for classifying 
					artefacts into a chronological order (Stone Age, Bronze Age, 
					Iron Age). Megalithic monuments, previously thought by some 
					antiquaries as unworthy of study because they belonged to an 
					unknown, conceivably evil, prehistoric culture, became as 
					acceptable for research as the Biblically-historical 
					classical sites had long been. When the first Neanderthal 
					bones were recognised in 1856, in Neander Valley (Germany), 
					Christian apologists claimed it was the special case of an 
					idiot whose curved legs arose from excessive equestrianism, 
					the eyebrow ridges thickened through the pain of rickets 
					causing extreme puckering. Instead Charles Darwin and his 
					supporters assigned Neanderthal Man his privileged place as 
					a missing link between ape and man -- not as Homo Sapiens 
					ancestor but from a coexisting evolution, since extinct.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>CONCLUDING 
					REMARKS</b><br>
					So much happened between 1854 and 1860 that unbiased 
					thinkers became convinced of the antiquity of man. The 
					discovery of Neanderthal Man, Darwins theory of natural 
					selection, and the evidence offered by Boucher de Perthes 
					and Pengelly were the compelling fresh elements. Usshers 
					diagnosis was false, and because evolution explained the 
					life sciences and human origins, Darwin held the key to 
					explaining the advent of man without recourse to divine 
					intervention. With it, archaeology came of age. The 
					Antiquity of Man by Charles Lyell was published in 1863 and 
					Charles Darwins The Descent of Man, and Selection in 
					Relation to Sex in 1871. The study of archaeology soared to 
					a high profile. A century later we know that human origins 
					go back 1.6 million years, of hominids four million years, 
					of the Earth 4.5 billion years and of the Universe almost 14 
					billion years. Few scholars in 1850 could have anticipated 
					this from the seeds then being sown, and we have reaped the 
					intellectual harvest ever since.</font></p>
