					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The science of 
					evolution has been with us for a long time now, enough, one 
					would think, for people to abandon the nonsensical 
					creationist theories of our religious past. Evidence of 
					geological, molecular-biological and other scientific types 
					has shown quite conclusively that the process of evolution 
					did take place, much like science has shown that the 
					heliocentric theory of the solar system was the correct and 
					that the Old Testament's geo-centric one was completely 
					wrong. It is interesting, then, that even among religious 
					groups, the flat earth societies are considered a joke while 
					evolution is still a subject that is frowned upon, 
					grudgingly accepted by some like the Catholic church ever 
					since the late pope, John Paul II, pronounced it as 
					scientific fact while declaring that the fiction of creation 
					in the Bible was something that conveyed what he called &quot;a 
					moral message,&quot; while groups ranging from extremists of the 
					Mel Gibson variety within the Catholic church, several 
					protestantr churches, Orthodox Jewish sects, virtually all 
					of Islam and now, in a recent entry to this gang of anti 
					commensense banditry, some fundamentalist Hindu groups as 
					well. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The reason for this 
					is that nothing comes closer to shaking the foundations of 
					religions as the science of evolution. My mentor in writing 
					on atheism, rationalism and freethought, the late M D 
					Gopalakrishnan and his wife, Prof M Thavamani, currently the 
					Principal of the Ethiraj College for Women, one of India's 
					finest womens' colleges, used to tell me that they found it 
					funny how, within the Semitic faiths themselves, there were 
					subtle changes with time. Moses would claim to have gone up 
					a hill by himself, to have met the Semitic god, and to have 
					received instructions from him. By Jesus' time, he did not 
					see any god though he claimed to be the son of god himself, 
					and contented himself and his followers with performing 
					&quot;miracles&quot; which are little different from the kind of 
					trickery performed by countless magicians before and since. 
					By the time Islam was ready to be spread by Muhammad, he 
					claimed to be only a prophet, not a son of god, someone who 
					met god on hill tops by hilself or anything of the sort. The 
					fact is that in the history of the Middle East itself, there 
					were fewer and fewer people who believed the old myths and 
					new ones had to be created in order to keep people focused 
					on the religious dogma of the day. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Early Christianity, 
					especially after the Christian faith's conquest of Europe, 
					would be brutal in enforcing ignorance among it's followers. 
					Those who dissented with it's primitive teachings (and there 
					had been vastly more refined thought that pre dated 
					Christianity among the ancient Greeks in Europe, though that 
					was left for the Muslims under Ibn Rushd to preserve) were 
					brutally tortured and killed and even later, thinkers like 
					Galileo were bullied into silence by the Catholic church's 
					display of thuggishness in torturing it's enemies before 
					him. it was political reasons that forced the end of the 
					Catholic church's dominance of the European continent, 
					though it would rally hard to enforce it's writ when Pius 
					XXII openly supported the Nazis and their attempt at 
					conquering Europe in World War II. These days, side by side 
					with accepting evolution, the current pope sticks to 
					demonstrating his world view in parroting the hateful 
					nonsense of his predecessors praising the Crusades on 
					occasion and quoting anti Muslim passages until he is made 
					to shut up by embarassed members of his own flock, and then 
					deviating to criticising the Harry Potter novels as Satanist 
					literature, making a grander buffoon of himself than any 
					religious leader has in a long time. But this is to digress 
					from the topic at hand. These days, the anti science baton 
					is carried, in the west, by Protestant churches, from the 
					Hallelujah shouting Pentecostals through the Methodists, 
					Baptists and what have you. These churches spew hatred for 
					Islam and while extreme fundamentalists among the Muslims 
					spew their hatred for them, both are united in trying to 
					denounce evolution. Theya re joined by the Hindu and Jewish 
					extremists in this enterprise. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To me, as a non 
					scientist, this has always been revealing. How religions 
					that have been mutually antagonistic towards each other down 
					their respective histories have found unity in opposing a 
					science that does not have any of the brute strength that 
					the sword arms of these religions have, how religions that 
					stress that their followers need not fear death in their 
					pursuit of their enemy run scared of facts that are 
					incapable of doing any physical harm to any religionist, 
					and, how faiths that have centuries old histories of 
					brutally suppressing people and ideas have been scrambling 
					to save themselves from the soft ideas first proposed to the 
					world by the son of a clergyman from England, have always 
					been fascinating. Indeed, pictures of Charles Darwin, a 
					balding, soft gentleman who reminds anyone who looks at his 
					pictures of a friend's grandfather sitting in a grand living 
					room to offer warm hospitality to visitors seem to worry the 
					pious so much that they have tried every lie and fraud 
					possible to discredit him and his ideas. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A lying religious 
					fraud, Lady Hope, who had never even met Darwin claimed that 
					on his death bed, he had &quot;recanted&quot; and converted to 
					Christianity. And the personal assassination industry then 
					began to employ pliant &quot;Scientists&quot; to offer their theories 
					on why evolution did not take place. As recently as a few 
					weeks ago, The Wall Street Journal carried an article by an 
					economist - what would the man know of science - carry out a 
					similar attack on the most vocal recent speaker for 
					evolution - Richard Dawkins. Claiming that Dawkins was not a 
					man whom any decent person could leave his wife near - I 
					would personally think that this was deserving of a libel by 
					Dawkins against the Journal - the oaf went on to claim that 
					nothing that Dawkins said was new and that, in fact, all of 
					his arguments had been derived from those of atheists in the 
					19th century. While I do not expect a mud slinger like the 
					writer of the article in question to offer anything 
					sensible, I wonder why he seemed to have forgotten that the 
					argu,ments were basically the same that came from Darwin's 
					time because evolutionists have to counter religious 
					arguments that are much older. Indeed, his co-religionists 
					follow the same scriptures that he does, and so have their 
					predecessors, for the past 2000 or more years. How do you 
					expect someone to argue these scriptures with ignorant 
					followers without going back to the scriptures themselves? 
					Indeed, it is always a point made by the religionists that 
					they cannot have any referential point other than the ideas 
					dished out in the scriptures themselves. The hypocrisy of 
					the writer in question was evident and the stupidity of the 
					editorial board of a newspaper that regards itself as the 
					snottiest of the snotty of New York newspapers was even more 
					visible. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is not to say 
					that the Wall Street Journal is alone in promoting this 
					nonsense along with the religionists. It's main rival, The 
					New York Times, a newspaper that calls itself &quot;the newspaper 
					of record&quot; while it goes about repeating it's propaganda 
					like a scratched record, carried it's own anti evolution 
					article before the recent elections, accusing evolutionists 
					of refusing to listen to the arguments of the creationists. 
					Again, like Lady Hope and the later writer in the WSJ, the 
					New York Times did not hesitate to stoop to the level of 
					liars and frauds in indirectly promoting a creationist 
					agenda. Perhaps, the Sulzberger owned newspaper was trolling 
					for votes. It has been known to indulge in fraudulent and 
					devious propaganda before elections - this was, after all, 
					the newspaper that asked American voters, before the last 
					presidential elections, to &quot;get over 9/11&quot; and vote for John 
					Kerry. Perhaps, it could not avoid lying as is it's habit, 
					in trying to drum up support, more successfully this time, 
					before another crucial election. In the end, it was clear 
					that this clamour was to try and bring the religious groups 
					to it's side by attacking what they perceived to be their 
					most dangerous enemy - evolutionists. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this lies the 
					truth about why religions fear the thoughts of a science 
					that has no ability to cause them physical harm. 
					Evolutionists are not like Selljuk hordes out to conquer 
					Byzantium, nor are they, like Atilla and the Huns, out to 
					defeat Rome by force. The fear that the religious outfits 
					have is that the lies that they have successfully sold the 
					world for centuries are exposed by this science. The 
					geocentric theory that failed is not as harmful as evolution 
					because religions cannot say, because of evolution, that man 
					is bound to an all powerful god who speaks t them through a 
					network of priests. Religious bodies are weakened in their 
					control over their followers when the hollow lies that they 
					have been feeding people about their god-given duties are 
					shown for what they specifically are - lies. They cannot, 
					anymore, try to cntrol people, giving divinely ordained 
					reasons in whatever they expect their flocks to do, whether 
					it is what or how they eat, how or when they have sex or 
					whatever. The world's religionists, especially the leaders 
					of the various religions who preside over vast financial 
					empires, are running scared - they have everything to lsoe 
					when their deceptions get exposed. Nothing attests to 
					Charles Darwin's greatness better - if his simple recording 
					and explanation of facts of natural history could shake up 
					somje of the worst, bloody and fraudulent establishments 
					that human history has ever known, he was a far greater man 
					than he was a scientist. The leaders of various religions 
					and their lackeys in their priesthoods and in the media, in 
					comparison, are evident as little people, mean, crooked and 
					incapable of anything honest. If there is a reason to 
					celebrate the greatness of Charles Darwin, it is this fact 
					along with the monumental work that he has left humankind.</font></p>
