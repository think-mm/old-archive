	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Historically 
	speaking, Mukto-Mona forum for secularists and rationalists is very young.&nbsp; 
	It was formed hardly six years ago by a bunch of grad students, members from 
	academia and professional field who were imbued with liberal ideals; they 
	saw the unchecked growth of ideas emanating from parochialism and age-old 
	blind belief system in the Internet.&nbsp; Therefore, to promote the nectar of 
	rationalism, humanism, secularism, etc., among members of cyber communities 
	these intrepid liberals formed this forum to get away from the evil spell of 
	irrationalities spawned by deep-seated bind belief system. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many seemingly 
	educated people from South Asia, who are professionals, academics, etc., 
	lead a modern life in the west taking advantage of all the products made 
	from scientific discoveries in the field of physics (automobiles, aircraft, 
	electricity, cellphone, microwave oven, etc.), chemistry (hygienic products, 
	toiletries, household products) and biology (antibiotics, fermentation 
	products).&nbsp; However, when it comes to the philosophical question of how and 
	when this physical world was formed, how life was started in the planet, and 
	what happens to the life form including us when we die, the same otherwise 
	intelligent people resort to the answer given by various blind belief 
	system, which are full of mumbo-jumbo based on folklore and unscientific.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Charles Darwin was 
	a naturalist in the nineteenth century when life science was at its 
	infancy.&nbsp; The molecular natures of genes were not even discovered, genetics 
	as a field of study was not established; thus, biologists were busy 
	classifying organisms.&nbsp; Under this backdrop, Darwin started his studies on 
	speciation.&nbsp; The taxonomists of his time were grouping plants, animals, and 
	to some extent microbes down to species.&nbsp; Therefore, the hot topic of 
	scientific discussion centered on how species are formed.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Darwin with a keen 
	mind took a voyage to South America and was astounded by the range of 
	variability he saw among life forms.&nbsp; Particularly, he was fascinated by the 
	size and shape of beaks among a group of small birds by the name finch.&nbsp; 
	From this cursory study came out the seminal work what the biologists call 
	the theory of speciation.&nbsp; Darwin explained how the beak of finches modifies 
	ever so slowly against the changing environment of the world each species 
	live.&nbsp; These adaptive changes are passed onto the next generation.&nbsp; If these 
	changes do not take place, then an entire species of finch may find their 
	environment where do they live to be hostile; consequently, the species may 
	become extinct.&nbsp; These simple ideas formed the basis of his theory of 
	evolution.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Darwin was 
	explaining the intricacies of his “simple” theory he did not have any 
	molecular tools to explain how changes of traits are passed onto the next 
	generation.&nbsp; About half a century after his passing away scientist in 
	England discovered in early 1950s the three dimensional structure of the 
	molecule that hold the key to preservation of information that allowed finch 
	to adapt to a new environment.&nbsp; Yes, I am writing about genes.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Darwin’s theory 
	about the origin of species started a tumult amongst academics and 
	researchers that cannot be squished by any force emanating from organized 
	religion.&nbsp; Biologists in the post Darwin days formulated the laws of 
	inheritance, discovered the chemical basis of gene, and now changing the 
	composition of a gene right in the laboratory.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lucky for me, in 
	the middle of 1980s I became involved in finding the gene for an enzyme by 
	the name phytase.&nbsp; We found the gene in fungi because this class of microbes 
	degrades one particular class of phosphorylated sugar, phytic acid for 
	survival.&nbsp; The animal kingdom does not make this enzyme because they could 
	obtain phosphorus from alternative source.&nbsp; After I publish my initial 
	findings on phytase’s chemical sequence in 1988 a Dutch company 
	over-expressed the gene to produce the enzyme for swine and poultry 
	industries.&nbsp; A group of animal scientists took the gene and inserted it into 
	the chromosome of a pig.&nbsp; Now that pig is producing the enzyme in their 
	saliva.&nbsp; This is an example of experimental evolution.&nbsp; When my colleagues 
	were tinkering with the expression of a single gene, animal scientists in 
	Scotland were involved in cloning not a single or 100 genes but the entire 
	animal.&nbsp; They stunned the entire world with the news of the birth of Dolly 
	the sheep in July 1996.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All these 
	remarkable progress in biology really stemmed from Darwin’s scientific 
	discovery of the origin of species.&nbsp; In pure and simple term, the two 
	species of any closely related organism varies because of their genetic 
	material or genes.&nbsp; Darwin had no idea what these genes are made of.&nbsp; But 
	hardly 30-40 years after his death scientists knew that the genetic 
	materials are contained in chromosome, which were later found to be nothing 
	more than nucleo-protein and composed of nucleic acid and some histone-like 
	basic proteins.&nbsp; Scientists in 1960s had speculated that while nucleic acid 
	holds the blueprint of the sequence of proteins, the gene product, the basic 
	proteins are involved in gene expression.&nbsp; This is the crux of the problem 
	now – how genes are expressed?&nbsp; Think for a moment this enigma – in mother’s 
	womb the same 24 pairs of chromosome divide and re-divide zillions of times 
	and in the process the genes for all vital organs are expressed to produce 
	eyes, lungs, heart, kidney, liver, etc., in a timely fashion.&nbsp; Our skin 
	cells also contain the same 24 pairs of chromosomes but 99.99% of the genes 
	are not allowed to express; therefore all we end up is the formation of 
	epithelial cells.&nbsp; How is it possible?&nbsp; If a group of cells become defiant 
	and keep on producing the same cells over and over, what we end is a tumor 
	(or cancer), which could have serious health consequence.&nbsp; Biologists have 
	made remarkable discoveries about the genes that control cell division.&nbsp; 
	Therefore, it is expected that cancer therapeutics will eventually come and 
	help is on the way to cure this deadly malady.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In mid 
	nineteenth century Charles Darwin made a series of observation about the 
	origin of species and his findings have enlightened the minds of future 
	biologists.&nbsp; His explanation of how the force of natural selection leads to 
	adaptive change in organism to compete, survive, and reproduce.&nbsp; This is 
	force that ultimately creates different species over time.&nbsp; This is what is 
	Darwinism.&nbsp; </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">The modern molecular biology is the offshoot of 
	Darwinism.&nbsp; Right now thousands of biologists are deciphering the genetic

	spawned by their discoveries.&nbsp; Darwin’s simple discovery had touched every 
	facets of biology.&nbsp; Its devastating blow on organized religion had not 
	escaped our inquisitive mind.&nbsp; Do you care to know that about 96% of the 
	academics that call them life scientists do not believe anymore the 
	eschatology (a belief or a doctrine concerning the ultimate or final things, 
	such as death, the destiny of humanity)?&nbsp; To me, this is the ultimate 
	triumph of Darwinism.&nbsp; It broke the servitude of religion amongst many 
	intelligent minds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"> </span></p>
