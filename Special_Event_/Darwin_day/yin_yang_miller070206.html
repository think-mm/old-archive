					<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><a name="intro">1. 
					Introduction</a></font></h2>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The black-and-white 
					symbol preceding the title of this section is what in 
					Chinese philosophy is called <i>T'ai-Chi T'u,</i> which 
					roughly translates as &quot;Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate&quot; and 
					represents a concept named &quot;yin-yang.&quot; Here is how it is 
					defined by Fritjof Capra on page 27 in his immensely popular 
					book <i>Tao of Science </i><a href="#1">[1]</a>, &quot;Chinese 
					philosophy... has always emphasized the complementary nature 
					of the intuitive and the rational and has represented them 
					by the archetypal pair <i>yin</i> and <i>yang</i>...&quot; On 
					page 106 he elaborates, &quot;In the realm of thought, <i>yin</i> 
					is the complete, female, intuitive mind, <i>yang</i> the 
					clear and rational male intellect.&quot; The symbol of <i>
					yin-yang</i> implies that these two sub-concepts smoothly 
					fit in with each other, their interplay entailing no 
					contradiction but rather an intimate mutual adjustment.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems to me that 
					the <i>yin-yang </i>concept aptly evinces the composition 
					and the main thrust of Professor Kenneth R. Miller's book
					<a href="#2">[2]</a> titled <i>Finding Darwin's God. </i>
					(Miller himself does not use anywhere the terms <i>yin</i> 
					and <i>yang</i>; their use in this article is exclusively my 
					choice). </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Kenneth R. Miller is 
					a prominent cell biologist and teacher, the co-author of 
					popular textbooks on biology and of scientific articles 
					devoted to intricate problems of biological science. The 
					book in question is though addressed to a mass audience and 
					represents a very valiant effort by a very intelligent, 
					knowledgeable and honest man to assert his heartfelt belief 
					in what he himself succinctly expressed in the subtitle of 
					the book, <i>A Scientist's Search For Common Ground Between 
					God And Evolution</i>.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It could be 
					anticipated that Miller's position would invoke ire from 
					both sides of the religion - evolution controversy. While 
					there are scores of scientists who successfully reconcile 
					their religious beliefs with the <i>operational agnosticism</i>
					<a href="#3">[3]</a> of their everyday scientific work, most 
					of them simply manage to separate their faith from their 
					scientific pragmatism viewing them as two unrelated realms. 
					On the other hand, many scientists who are either agnostics 
					or atheists adhere to the position of the late biologist and 
					essayist Steven Jay Gould, according to which science and 
					religion are two &quot;Non-overlapping Magisteria&quot; <a href="#4">
					[4]</a> so they are not concerned with the reconciliation 
					between religious beliefs and scientific empiricism which 
					may be a problem for their religious colleagues. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Miller's position is 
					not a tacit acceptance of the idea of the two nonoverlapping 
					magisteria. His thesis is that he is firm in his faith <i>
					not despite</i> his acceptance of Darwinism, but, on the 
					contrary, because, in his view, Darwin's theory <i>supports 
					his faith rather than contradicting it.</i> </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this article my 
					goal is to evaluate both the <i>yang </i>and <i>yin</i> 
					parts of Miller's book, the <i>yang</i> being his masterful 
					defense of Darwinism and the evolution theory and the <i>yin</i>his 
					assertion of his religious faith, and to see whether or not 
					these two parts do indeed so smoothly fit in with each other 
					as the <i>T'ai-chi T'a</i> diagram implies. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is a common 
					knowledge that both sides of the religion-evolution 
					controversy have their extreme fringes. On the atheistic end 
					of the spectrum we see such outspoken adversaries of 
					religious faith as Richard Dawkins <a href="#5">[5]</a>, 
					Peter Atkins <a href="#6">[6]</a>, and Daniel Dennet
					<a href="#7">[7]</a>. On the religious extreme we see such 
					fervent haters of Darwinism as Phillip Johnson <a href="#8">
					[8]</a> and Jonathan Wells <a href="#9">[9]</a>. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Miller's 
					position is both pro-religion and pro-evolution, we could 
					expect that his book would be disparaged from both sides of 
					the controversy. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To be sure, attacks 
					followed. However, all of them, often very vitriolic, came 
					only from the camp of anti-evolutionists. The pro-evolution 
					side, while meeting with approval the <i>yang</i> part of 
					Miller's book (wherein Miller eloquently and with great 
					erudition argued in favor of the Darwinian theory of 
					evolution), mostly keeps silent about the <i>yin</i> part 
					(wherein Miller argued in favor of his religious faith).</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The creationist camp 
					seems not to have been mollified to any extent by Miller's 
					defense of his religious faith. Their hatred of Darwinism is 
					obviously more important to them than solidarity with their 
					fellow believers. In a book <a href="#10">[10]</a> Phillip 
					Johnson, in his usual lawyer's style <a href="#11">[11]</a> 
					pounced on Miller's book in a rude manner, wherein insults 
					seem to be the prevalent substitute for logic and knowledge 
					about the subject. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here are a few 
					examples of Johnson's assaults on Miller. On page 130 of his 
					book <a href="#10">[10]</a> Johnson asserts that Miller's 
					rendition of the position of creationists is a &quot;caricature.&quot; 
					(By the way, Johnson is offended by the appellation 
					&quot;creationist;&quot; he likes to be called a &quot;design theorist.&quot;) 
					On page 131, Johnson says that Miller &quot;grotesquely distorts 
					the design concept,&quot; that he &quot;does not recognize the problem 
					of information creation.&quot; On page 133 Johnson tells the 
					readers that &quot;Miller's incomprehension of the information 
					problem is particularly visible when he turns to embryonic 
					development.&quot; It would be funny if it were not so obnoxious 
					to hear the accusations of a highly competent professional 
					scientist of &quot;incomprehension&quot; of this or that, coming from 
					a lawyer whose own amateurish understanding, for example, of 
					information, is egregiously inadequate (see, for example
					<a href="#11">[11]</a>). Moreover, Johnson is notorious for 
					gross distortions of the views of those scientist he does 
					not like, often misquoting or brazenly quoting out of 
					context (see, for example <a href="#12">[12]</a>). However, 
					I think Miller should not be offended since he is in good 
					company: Johnson's arrogance extends even to accusing 
					Einstein of lack of modesty and consistency (page 92 in
					<a href="#11">[11]</a>). </font></p>
					<h2 align="justify"><a name="narrative">
					<font face="Verdana">2. The narrative starts</font></h2>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The <i>yin</i> and
					<i>yang</i> parts in Miller's books are not strictly 
					separated; elements of both are encountered throughout 
					Miller's narrative. However, the first two-thirds or so of 
					the book are overwhelmingly on the <i>yang</i> side of the 
					narrative while the rest is prevalently on the <i>yin</i> 
					side.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before delving into 
					the detailed discussion of his thesis, Miller tells the 
					story of his education and his becoming strongly 
					pro-evolution. He grew up in a family of Catholic believers 
					and from the early childhood was steeped in the traditional 
					Catholic worldview. There is little doubt that the emotions 
					experienced in early childhood leave indelible marks in 
					every person's mind and heart, and Miller hardly could be an 
					exception. However, possessing a nimble mind and a keen 
					sense of the importance of truth, he discovered the 
					indisputable logic of the evolution theory whose main 
					tenets, although appearing to contradict the teachings of 
					Miller's Catholic instructors, seemed to be beyond a 
					reasonable doubt. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With delightful 
					clarity and brevity, Miller delivers the basics of the 
					evolution theory in a few paragraphs, stressing the obvious 
					factual foundation of that theory.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The basic concepts 
					of Darwinism are exceptionally simple, given the immense 
					scope of its implications. Miller briefly explains the three 
					principal elements of Darwinian theory (pages 7-9): a) 
					Domesticated plants and animals show a tremendous range of 
					variations; b) A similar range of variations exists in 
					nature among wild species; c) All living things are engaged 
					in a struggle for existence. &quot;This struggle, combined with 
					variations, results in natural selection.&quot; A few lines 
					further Miller continues, &quot;Incredibly, that's all there was 
					to it. In those principles you have all of Darwin's theory.&quot;
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the next several 
					pages Miller tells about those writers who assert that 
					accepting Darwinism entails abandoning religious faith (the 
					view shared by many on both sides of the controversy). Now 
					he defines the main goal of his book. He writes (page 17), 
					&quot;Is it time to replace existing religions with a 
					scientifically responsible, attractively sentimental 
					ethically driven Darwinism....? Does evolution really 
					nullify all world views that depend upon the spiritual? ... 
					My answer, in each and every case, is a resounding <i>no</i>... 
					The reason, as I hope to show, is <i>because</i> evolution 
					is right. &quot;</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we see from the 
					above quotations, Miller's goal is beyond the simple thesis 
					that one may accept the evolution theory and still keep 
					religious faith - a thesis which is considered by scores of 
					scientists and laymen alike as non-controversial - it is to 
					provide arguments in favor of faith based on the veracity of 
					evolution theory! In this ambitious endeavor Miller would 
					probably find not too many co-travelers. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To achieve his goal 
					Miller's path had to be two-pronged. First he had to offer 
					arguments in favor of evolution and show the lack of 
					substantiation in the anti-evolution critiques (the <i>yang</i> 
					of his narrative); second, he had to offer arguments in 
					favor of his religious faith (the <i>yin</i> of his 
					discourse). Moreover, he had to show that the <i>yang</i> 
					and <i>yin</i> in his conceptual system do indeed smoothly 
					fit in with each other. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us review how 
					well Miller did the job he embarked upon and see whether or 
					not he succeeded in all three components of his discourse.
					</font></p>
					<h2 align="justify"><a name="yang"><font face="Verdana">3. 
					Yang</font></h2>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After offering the 
					simple schema of Darwinism, with its three easily 
					comprehensible and evidently true elements, Miller proceeds 
					to elaborate by providing a set of arguments in favor of the 
					theory of evolution. In clear prose, with aptly chosen 
					examples, he explains to his readers how science works. 
					Demonstrating wide erudition often extending far beyond 
					biology, Miller argues against creationists who insist that 
					science is not capable of asserting anything about the past, 
					because the past cannot be reproduced in a lab and directly 
					observed. He compares scientific inquiry to criminal 
					detection and points out that circumstantial evidence is 
					often a highly reliable marker of the events which occurred 
					in the past, for the &quot;...present always contains clues to 
					the past.&quot; (page 23). </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In pages 23 through 
					56 Miller offers a fine argument in favor of the validity of 
					evolution theory, wherein adherence to evidence is combined 
					with entertaining manner of his narrative. Continuing, in 
					chapter 3 titled <i>God The Charlatan</i> Miller explains 
					how science has established the age of the earth (about 4.5 
					billion years) describing in a transparent way the methods 
					based on the radioactive decay of isotopes, and decisively 
					debunking the ridiculous assertions of the <i>young earth 
					creationists</i> based on alleged data related to the 
					magnetic field of the earth and other similarly 
					unsubstantiated theses. In chapter 4 titled <i>God The 
					Magician </i>Miller clarifies the alleged contradiction 
					between Darwinism and the theory of &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot; 
					suggested by Steven Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge
					<a href="#13">[13]</a>. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The theory in 
					question has been widely exploited by the anti-Darwinian 
					fighting force as a tool allegedly devastating to Darwinism. 
					Miller convincingly shows that Gould-Eldredge's theory fits 
					quite well in with Darwinism. While this theory has been 
					opposed by many biologists like Richard Dawkins, this has 
					occurred within the framework of normal, even if sometimes 
					heated, scientific dispute, and regardless of the outcome of 
					the dispute it will not destroy the theory of evolution, 
					because if Gould-Eldredge's theory is true, it only will add 
					fine details to Darwinism; if it is untrue it will be 
					abandoned in the further development of science. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his defense of 
					the evolution theory Miller had to face adversaries of 
					Darwinism and show that their attack has no justification in 
					factual evidence. A large part of Miller's counter-attack is 
					directed against several anti-Darwinists, like Henry Morris, 
					David Berlinski, Michael Behe and Phillip Johnson. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While Miller's 
					critique of Morris and Berlinski, as well as his general 
					critical remarks regarding Johnson, are well substantiated 
					and convincing, they do not stand out as especially original 
					since similar arguments against the mentioned champions of 
					anti-Darwinism have been forwarded by many other critics as 
					well. Miller's critiques of Behe and of Johnson's specific 
					assaults on Darwinian biology are a different story. Here 
					Miller often offers original arguments that stem from his 
					ken as a professional biologist. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On pages 92-115 
					Miller shows the egregious fallacy of Johnson's discourse, 
					wherein the statement of Johnson's incompetence is strongly 
					supported by hard data from paleontology (the fossils 
					record). </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Equally impressing 
					is Miller's revealing the fallacy of Behe's concepts from a 
					purely biological viewpoint. Although Behe is himself a 
					professional biologist, a professor of biochemistry, 
					Miller's encounter with Behe looks much like a fight of a 
					bear with a puppy. Behe's notorious book <a href="#14">[14]</a>
					<i>Darwin's Black Box,</i> where he introduced his concept 
					of <i>Irreducible Complexity</i> (IC) of biochemical 
					systems, has been criticized in many articles, books, and 
					reviews from various viewpoints - generally biological
					<a href="#15">[15]</a>, specifically biochemical
					<a href="#16">[16]</a>, probabilistic and 
					complexity-theoretical, <a href="#17">[17]</a> and others
					<a href="#18">[18]</a>. Miller's contribution to that 
					critique seems to be among the best substantiated and most 
					convincing, and distinct in that it comes from a person 
					highly knowledgeable in the intricacies of the biological 
					details which are essential for the judgment on the validity 
					of Behe's discourse. (Miller also indicates that he 
					consulted with Russell Doolittle in regard to his discussion 
					of the blood clotting cascade; Professor Doolittle is the 
					foremost expert in blood clotting which Behe chose as one of 
					examples of IC; hence, although himself a very knowledgeable 
					cell biologist, Miller, in his analysis of Behe's concept, 
					used also the expertise of other specialists, thus giving 
					even more weight to his revelation of Behe's fallacies.)
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here are the main 
					points of Miller's critique of Behe. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In chapter 6 titled
					<i>God The Mechanic</i>, Miller demonstrates the lack of 
					substantiation in Behe's main thesis. Briefly, that thesis 
					can be descried as follows. A biological cell contains a 
					very large number of what Behe calls <i>protein machines</i>. 
					This term denotes complex combinations of multiple protein 
					molecules working together and each performing a certain 
					function vital for the cell's existence as part of a living 
					organism. This assertion is obviously true, and Miller lists 
					several such <i>machines</i>, &quot;These include the pathway of 
					signaling proteins in the light-sensitive cells of our eyes, 
					the intricate cascade of proteins that cause blood to clot, 
					the incredibly flexible antibody-producing machinery of our 
					immune system, and the vital chemical pathways that are used 
					to produce compounds essential for each living cell.&quot; Behe 
					further asserts that many of these protein machines are 
					&quot;irreducibly complex.&quot; This term in Behe's usage means that 
					the removal of even a single protein from a particular 
					&quot;machine&quot; will render it dysfunctional. The main point of 
					Behe's thesis is that irreducibly complex systems could not 
					evolve via a Darwinian process of descent with modification 
					because natural selection, which is an essential part of 
					Darwin's theory, can only work on an existing system 
					performing some useful function. Since an irreducibly 
					complex system &quot;by definition&quot; has no functional precursors, 
					it cannot be a product of natural selection. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obviously, Behe's 
					assertion could be shown to be wrong in at least two ways. 
					First, if it can be shown that the protein machines used as 
					examples by Behe are not irreducibly complex, i.e. that the 
					removal of some of their parts does not render them 
					dysfunctional, this would work strongly against Behe's 
					theory. Second, if it can be shown that the protein 
					machines, even if they seem to meet Behe's definition of 
					irreducible complexity, still could have evolved via a 
					Darwinian path, this would decisively debunk Behe's thesis.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Critics of Behe's 
					theory utilized both ways. Some of them cast doubt on the 
					very existence of irreducibly complex machines and offered 
					evidence that the systems Behe claimed to be irreducibly 
					complex actually can work even if some of their proteins are 
					removed. This type of argument points to evidence that 
					protein machines more often than not possess <i>redundant 
					complexity</i> rather than irreducible complexity
					<a href="#19">[19]</a>.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Miller also uses 
					this type of argument. For example, he writes (page 140), 
					&quot;As a cell biologist, I was particularly amused by a 
					biochemist's suggestion that the complexity of the cilium is 
					irreducible.&quot; He provides examples of various &quot;designs&quot; of 
					cilium, all of which successfully perform the same function 
					despite variations in the protein composition of the cilium, 
					thus demonstrating the fallacy of Behe's assertion. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He also shows that 
					all the listed protein machines, whether or not they meet 
					Behe's definition of irreducible complexity, could very well 
					have evolved via a Darwinian path entailing natural 
					selection. One by one, Miller demonstrates how each of the 
					allegedly irreducibly complex system could have evolved from 
					precursors via descent with modification, led by natural 
					selection. The sonar system of the bats, the human eye, the 
					blood clotting cascade and a number of other systems are 
					analyzed and it is shown that they can be reasonably 
					attributed to a Darwinian evolutionary process.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whereas some of 
					Miller's arguments against Behe's concept, although well 
					articulated and convincing, are not much different from 
					arguments offered by other critics, there is in Miler's book 
					at least one notion which, to my knowledge, has not been 
					suggested by any other of Behe's detractors and which 
					constitutes a devastating blow to Behe's conceptual 
					construct. It is found on pages 161-163. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The fatal blow to 
					Behe's thesis comes, ironically, from Behe himself,&quot; writes 
					Miller on page 161. A few lines further, Miller adds, &quot;Behe 
					makes the fatal theoretical mistake of taking himself a 
					little too seriously.&quot; These statements, with all of their 
					polemical sharpness, seem well justified by Miller's 
					subsequent analysis of one of Behe's ideas. Behe's idea is 
					that all the diversity of the biological world was 
					potentially contained in the &quot;first cell&quot; made by the 
					mysterious &quot;designer&quot; (whom Behe avoids naming God) some 
					four billion years ago. This first cell, according to Behe, 
					already held the designs of all the irreducibly complex 
					systems found in the present-days cells of living organisms, 
					but these systems were not yet &quot;turned on.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Miller convincingly 
					shows the absurdity of Behe's hypothesis. He writes, &quot;If we 
					choose to give Behe's theory serious consideration, if we 
					treat it as a scientific hypothesis, then we are obliged to 
					ask what would happen to those preformed genes during the 
					billions of years to follow? As any student of biology will 
					tell you, because those genes are not expressed, natural 
					selection would not be able to weed out genetic mistakes. 
					Mutations would accumulate in these genes at breathtaking 
					rates, rendering them hopelessly changed and inoperative 
					hundreds of millions of years before Behe says that they 
					will be needed.&quot;</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Miller concludes the 
					paragraph with a statement that leaves no route to the 
					salvation of Behe's &quot;theory&quot;: &quot;The result is an absolutely 
					hopeless genetic fantasy of 'preformed' genes waiting for 
					the organisms that might need them to appear gradually - and 
					the utter collapse of Behe's hoped-for biochemical challenge 
					to evolution.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Miller's assault 
					upon Behe's concept is informed, often elegant, well 
					supported by many examples and justifiably results in a 
					categorical succinct assertion (page 150) &quot;...the notion of 
					irreducible complexity is nonsense.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It should be noted 
					that the quoted statement does not mean that Miller denies 
					the very possibility that certain systems can indeed be 
					irreducibly complex in that all their parts are necessary 
					for the system being functional. Miller's rejection of the 
					irreducible complexity concept actually relates to its 
					rendition by Behe who uses that concept to assert the 
					alleged impossibility of the evolution of protein machines 
					via Darwinian mechanism. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The quoted statement 
					stands alone in Miller's book - he usually is restrained and 
					respectful of various views regardless of whether he shares 
					them or not. However, given Miller's strong and clearly 
					articulated arguments against Behe's theory, the above 
					categorical statement seems to be fully justified.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Overall, Miller lays 
					bare the futility of Behe's idea and shows that the latter 
					is just the worn-out and very old <i>argument from design</i> 
					dressed in a biochemical mantle.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is no surprise 
					that Miller's book became a target of ferocious attacks from 
					the creationist camp (as can be exemplified by Johnson's 
					rude anti-Miller diatribes <a href="#10">[10]</a>). These 
					attacks show that Miller succeeded in hitting the 
					anti-evolution crowd very painfully, revealing the abject 
					futility of their position. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having dealt with 
					the anti-evolutionists and inflicted devastating blows on 
					them in the <i>yang</i> part of his book, Miller then 
					proceeds to the <i>yin</i> part wherein he sets a goal - to 
					justify his religious faith as supposedly supported by the 
					data of science. Let us see how he succeeded in that 
					endeavor.</font></p>
					<h2 align="justify"><a name="yin"><font face="Verdana">4. 
					Yin</font></h2>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The <i>yin</i> part 
					of Miller's book wherein his goal is to assert his religious 
					faith as supposedly supported by scientific data, differs 
					drastically from the <i>yang</i> part where he defends 
					evolution and debunks its critics. The <i>yin</i> part is 
					more of a theological character and is long on repetitive 
					arbitrary assertions but short on factual or logical 
					substantiation. We do not see in the <i>yin</i> part any 
					empirical data which would testify in favor of Miller's 
					Christian faith, nor any logical discourse wherein a certain 
					clearly stated premise is followed by a logical sequence of 
					notions leading to a conclusion. What we see, instead, is a 
					display of an intelligent and insightful mind desperately 
					trying to prove to himself that his religious faith has a 
					rational foundation. I don't believe skeptics will be swayed 
					by Miller's pro-faith arguments. This is not because his 
					arguments are doubtful or weak, but simply because there are 
					no <i>arguments </i>at all, just assertions not supported by 
					evidence but repeated time and time again with a boring 
					persistence. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us look at some 
					of the notions Miller discusses in order to prove his thesis 
					that science is &quot;the best friend&quot; of faith.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One line of Miller's 
					supposed proof of the validity of his faith is in appealing 
					to the modern physics, in particular to the quantum 
					indeterminacy found by science in nature. Although Miller's 
					narrative in this part is mostly factually correct, it 
					exaggerates the consensus among physicists in regard to the 
					mentioned indeterminacy. In fact, the problem of 
					indeterminacy in the quantum world continues to be a subject 
					of dispute among scientists. Many of them (for example the 
					late Richard Feynman <a href="#20">[20]</a>) are indeed of 
					the opinion that events on a subatomic scale are of a 
					non-deterministic nature. In Feynman's words, nature itself 
					&quot;does not know&quot; what the outcome of an event will be (for 
					example, through which slit an electron will pass if 
					encountering a partition with two slits in it). There is, 
					though, a competing view (championed, for example, by Bohm, 
					and Bohm and Hiley <a href="#21">[21]</a>) according to 
					which nature <i>does know </i>the outcome of an event, in 
					the sense that any outcome is predetermined by the <i>hidden 
					parameters</i> which are not known to the observer. The 
					verdict has not yet been final on that matter. If Bohm's 
					view will one day triumph, the foundation of Miller's 
					argument would collapse.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, even if 
					Feynman's view prevails, this in itself will not justify 
					Miller's contention. Whether there are hidden parameters or 
					the subatomic events are indeed non-deterministic, both 
					views may be interpreted if desired as an argument in favor 
					of the creation of the universe by God, but can equally be 
					interpreted in many other ways. The non-deterministic 
					character of quantum world, if it is indeed such, does not 
					entail any theological consequences. It is equally 
					compatible both with faith and the lack thereof. Of course 
					Miller is entitled to draw any conclusions he is inclined 
					to, but they have no evidentiary value for skeptics unless 
					he can offer factually and logically uncontroversial 
					evidence in favor of his position. There is none. Whether 
					the universe we live in is a Newtonian fully deterministic 
					one or it is non-deterministic on the subatomic level, 
					neither option requires the hypothesis of a supernatural 
					creator for which there is no evidence that would satisfy 
					the requirements of scientific rigor. Whatever the data of 
					science do (or will) show, science has no tools to answer 
					the question of the existence or non-existence of God or 
					gods. Therefore we have to follow Ockam's razor and avoid 
					making arbitrary hypothesis as long as we wish to stay 
					within the framework of logic and factual evidence. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The best Miller is 
					able to assert by way of argument is that quantum 
					indeterminacy is compatible with his faith. I don't believe 
					anybody would argue against such an assertion. However, 
					quantum indeterminacy, if it indeed is a fact, is equally 
					compatible with the lack of religious faith. Given Miller's 
					evident great intelligence and eloquence, the paucity of 
					real arguments in the <i>yin</i> part of his book seem to 
					affirm the suspicion that real arguments in favor of faith 
					which would be on a par with arguments normally accepted as 
					legitimate in a scientific dispute, simply do not exist.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me discuss some 
					of details of Miller's discourse in those parts of his book 
					where he tries to convince readers in the validity of his 
					religious faith. </font></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><a name="indet"><font face="Verdana">
					Indeterminacy and randomness</font></h3>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 212 Miller 
					writes, referring to anti-evolutionists, &quot;Part of their 
					problem surely comes from the act of confusing 'random' with 
					'indeterminate.' In ordinary speech, when we say that 
					something is random, we generally mean that <i>anything</i> 
					can happen, with all outcomes having equal probabilities... 
					Physical events, generally speaking, are not at all random 
					in this sense because all outcomes are not equally 
					probable... Events at the atomic level are indeterminate, 
					but not random - they follow understandable statistical 
					pattern, and those pattern are the ones we sometimes elevate 
					to the status of physical laws.&quot;</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While I have no 
					intention of defending the position of anti-evolutionists 
					who often indeed display miscomprehension of randomness, 
					unfortunately Miller's own treatment of randomness is on 
					amateurish level. Of course, we may not demand from a cell 
					biologist cognizance of intricate concepts of mathematics, 
					so Miller's dilettantism in this particular instance can be 
					readily forgiven, especially in view of his overall good 
					level of presentation of non-biological matters. However, 
					since his discourse in regard to randomness is part of his 
					overall effort to support his religious beliefs with data of 
					science, we cannot fail to notice the weakness of his 
					pro-faith argument.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, whatever 
					the meaning of randomness in &quot;ordinary speech&quot; may happen to 
					be, randomness is not an equivalent of equiprobability. 
					There may be various degrees of randomness, and it has to be 
					defined independent of equiprobability since the latter 
					obviously cannot have various degrees. Outcomes may be 
					either equally probable or not equally probable, with no 
					tertiary quid. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Randomness is 
					rigorously treated in the algorithmic theory of 
					information/complexity <a href="#22">[22]</a>. First, unless 
					we deal with an infinitely large system, we never can be 
					confident that a system is indeed genuinely random. That is 
					why the terms &quot;pseudo-random&quot; or &quot;quasi-random&quot; are common, 
					for example, in computer science. According to algorithmic 
					theory, randomness is defined via the concept of complexity 
					(often referred to as Kolmogorov complexity). A detailed 
					discussion of Kolmogorov complexity and its relation to 
					randomness is beyond the scope of this article. I have 
					mentioned this point as an illustration of how Miller's 
					discourse deteriorates as soon as he leaves his fight 
					against anti-evolutionists and turns to his unconvincing 
					effort to show that his religious faith is supported by 
					science.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indeed, as Miller 
					continues his discourse he tries to build a bridge from his 
					interpretation of randomness to the supposed &quot;key feature of 
					the mind of God&quot; (page 213). This key feature, in Miller's 
					opinion, is &quot;indeterminacy&quot; which, as Miller says, 
					anti-evolutionists &quot;misconstrue as randomness.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From a skeptic's 
					standpoint Miller's argument sounds arbitrary, since the 
					&quot;indeterminacy&quot; of the subatomic world (which is still a 
					subject of disputes among physicists) does not require a 
					hypothesis of a supernatural creator of the universe. Miller 
					concedes that quantum physics does not prove the existence 
					of a Supreme Being (page 213). However, since the 
					&quot;indeterminacy&quot; puts a limit on what science can ever reveal 
					about the real world, this, in his view, points to a 
					&quot;Creator who fashioned it to allow us the freedom and 
					independence necessary to make our acceptance or rejection 
					of His love a genuinely free choice.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While I realize that 
					Miller's thesis exemplified by the above quotation may be 
					greeted with a heartfelt approval by millions of believers, 
					to my mind of a skeptic the attempt to use quantum physics 
					as a theological argument sounds unsubstantiated. While in 
					his <i>yang</i> part Miller's arguments were all based on 
					factual evidence and transparent logic, in his <i>yin</i> 
					part he resorts to obviously arbitrary assumptions. If we 
					apply Ockam's razor, there is no basis for introducing the 
					extraneous hypothesis of a supernatural Creator which has no 
					foundation in any scientific data. Miller and millions of 
					other believers are satisfied that the data of science can 
					be viewed as compatible with their faith, and that is, of 
					course, a personal choice for each individual. Millions of 
					people adhered to various religions long before the advent 
					of modern science, including quantum physics. Miller's 
					entire discussion of indeterminacy does not seem to have any 
					relevance to the question of God's existence. Science has no 
					tools to decide the question of God's existence, and 
					Miller's attempt to mobilize the scientific arguments to 
					support his faith is as fruitless as it is feeble. It 
					contrasts drastically with his brilliant effort in defending 
					evolution and disproving the creationists. </font></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><a name="ex"><font face="Verdana">
					Excursions into theology</font></h3>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On pages 217-218 we 
					find Miller's excursion into theology. In my view Miller's 
					thesis at this point becomes quite obscure, as it is 
					delivered in a way atypically nebulous as compared with the 
					overall eloquent and transparent argumentation found in most 
					of the chapters and paragraphs of his book. Here is a 
					quotation illustrating my remark. On page 218, concluding 
					his theological excursion, Miller writes, &quot;In the 
					traditional view of God's power held by all Western 
					religions, God's presence and His power are part of the 
					continuing truth of existence. What this means, in plain and 
					simple terms, is that ordinary processes, rooted in the 
					genuine materialism of science, ought to be sufficient to 
					allow for God's work - yesterday, today, and tomorrow.&quot;
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am not interested 
					in analyzing the dubious thesis that &quot;all Western religions&quot; 
					share the same attitude to the God's presence and power. 
					Miller seems to paint here with too wide a brush, but this 
					is neither here nor there. The entire assertion seems to be 
					of little meaning. For example, what is the meaning of the 
					expression &quot;continuing truth of existence?&quot; In my view there 
					is none. It looks like Miller, having set out on the job of 
					showing that the materialistic science supports his 
					religious faith, found himself at loss, and therefore 
					resorted to an assertion which, although seemingly 
					sophisticated and evincing some hidden meaning, is actually 
					empty of content. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Discussing &quot;all 
					Western religions,&quot; Miller is sometimes not quite accurate 
					in referring to their tenets (this, again, contrasts with 
					his very accurate references to the essence of evolution 
					theory in his <i>yang</i> part). For example, on pages 223 
					through 226, Miller discusses the big bang and asserts that 
					the modern cosmological science supports the thesis of our 
					universe having a beginning: &quot;...science has confirmed, in 
					remarkable detail, the distinctive beginning that theology 
					has always required.&quot; This statement is imprecise from the 
					viewpoints of both theology and science. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Miller puts in 
					one hat all &quot;Western religions,&quot; obviously Judaism is one of 
					the religions falling under his classification. However 
					Judaic theology, since its earliest rabbinical authorities, 
					asserted that our universe was preceded by earlier 
					universes. Nature, according to that concept, has either 
					existed always or at least for a much longer period of time 
					than our universe, as a sequence of worlds replacing each 
					other. Here is, for example, a quotation from an early 
					Talmudic commentary on the Torah <a href="#23">[23]</a>: 
					&quot;God created and destroyed worlds, none of which he liked, 
					until he found this one.&quot; Christian theology abandoned that 
					concept of Judaic theology, but Miller seems not to realize 
					that there are serious distinctions even between various 
					Western religions, and hence provides no reason why his 
					particular version of faith should be preferred to other 
					versions. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In yet another 
					excursion into theology, Miller asks (and tries to answer) 
					the question of the seeming incompatibility between the 
					concept of God who has created the world according to a plan 
					and with a purpose and the indisputable role of random 
					factors both in the physical world and the human affairs. 
					For example, on page 233 we read, &quot;If evolution really did 
					take place, then God must have rigged everything. Otherwise, 
					how could He have been sure that evolution would have 
					produced us?&quot; Strangely, Miller, so logical in the <i>yang</i> 
					part of his discourse, ignores here the obviously more 
					parsimonious conclusion - there is no need to assume the 
					existence of God to explain the evolution. By assuming the 
					existence of a supernatural creator, he puts himself in a 
					position where he has no reasonable answer to his question. 
					His only answer, which has been heard many times before and 
					which does not really answer anything, is that (page 236) 
					&quot;God's means are beyond our ability to fathom... &quot;If I 
					recall correctly, this thesis had already been offered about 
					two millennia before our time: &quot;My thoughts are not your 
					thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. For 
					as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways 
					higher than your ways&quot; (Isaiah 55:8). This statement may be 
					viewed as a great poetry, but has no real evidentiary or 
					explanatory significance. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Actually, with a 
					strange inconsistency, a few paragraphs later Miller, again, 
					admits that his supposed explanation does not explain 
					anything. On page 239 we read, &quot;...miraculous is beyond 
					explanation, beyond our understanding...Miracles, by 
					definition, do not have to make scientific sense.&quot; If that 
					is so, why should we believe in miracles whose occurrence is 
					supported only by ancient legends without a verifiable 
					proof? Miller the believer obviously applies to his beliefs 
					the criteria which are different from those he applies to 
					the findings of science. When he writes about evolution, he 
					strictly adheres to well-substantiated evidence. When 
					writing about his faith, he does not offer any evidence, 
					appealing instead to assumptions lacking parsimonious 
					content. </font></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><a name="cosmo"><font face="Verdana">
					Excursions into cosmology</font></h3>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Miller turns to 
					cosmology, again his statements (pages 224-226) oversimplify 
					the matter. He interprets the evidence for the occurrence of 
					the big bang as evidence that our universe had a distinct 
					beginning at some point in time about 12 to 15 billion years 
					ago. On page 225 he writes, &quot;One of the most remarkable 
					findings of cosmological science is that the universe did 
					have a beginning.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even if we ignore a 
					number of cosmologies which have been offered as 
					alternatives to the theory of an inflationary hot big bang 
					(such as the <i>cold </i>big bang theory, the symmetric 
					matter-antimatter theory, the variable G theory, the tired 
					light theory, the shrinking atoms theory, the theory of 
					eternally oscillating universe, and others), the prevalent 
					theory of the big bang does not necessarily imply a 
					beginning of our universe at some point of time. There are 
					several interpretations of the big bang <a href="#24">[24]</a> 
					which do not require a distinct beginning for our universe. 
					There are also hypotheses of the possible existence of a 
					preceding universe or many preceding universes. Of course 
					these hypotheses, including those assuming the existence of 
					preceding universes, are not supported by direct empirical 
					evidence, but in that they are no worse than Miller's 
					hypothesis of a Creator. On the other hand, some of the 
					hypotheses which deny the distinct beginning of time
					<a href="#24">[24]</a>, unlike the hypothesis of a 
					supernatural creator, offer scenarios which potentially may 
					be tested in the subsequent development of science and which 
					have explanatory power absent in the hypothesis of a 
					supernatural creator. Miller provides no arguments in favor 
					of his belief in a supernatural creator which would 
					reasonably compete with the hypotheses not assuming such a 
					creator. The latter, although speculative, at least suggest 
					certain arguments of theoretical nature which are absent in 
					Miller's assumption of a supernatural creator. </font></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><a name="antro"><font face="Verdana">
					Anthropic coincidences</font></h3>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On pages 227 through 
					232 Miller discusses the so-called anthropic coincidences. 
					His discussion of that matter is on such a level that it is 
					hard to believe it belongs to the same author who so 
					brilliantly discussed evolution on the preceding pages of 
					the same book. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There exists a large 
					body of publications about the Anthropic Principle - a term 
					introduced by Brandon Carter in 1973 - which is based on the 
					observation <a href="#25">[25]</a> that the universe seems 
					to be extremely well &quot;fine-tuned&quot; for the existence of life. 
					Miller writes (page 228), &quot;... the very fact that we are 
					here to make a fuss means that the physical constants of the 
					universe were set up in a way that made our existence 
					possible.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I submit that the 
					values of the physical constants, which seem to be precisely 
					what they must be to enable the existence of life, in no way 
					substantiate Miller's notion that these values were 
					intentionally &quot;set up.&quot; On the contrary, if life existed 
					despite the values of those constants being non-conducive to 
					the existence of life, this would logically support the 
					hypothesis that a supernatural power was necessary to create 
					life against the natural odds. If, though, the physical 
					constants happen to be so precisely &quot;fine-tuned&quot; for the 
					existence of life, there is nothing surprising that life 
					indeed does exist in such a hospitable universe, thus 
					requiring no arbitrary hypothesis of a supernatural source 
					of life.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Continuing, Miller 
					asserts that unbelievers among scientists are in an &quot;anthropic 
					trap.&quot; This is a wishful thinking. There is no &quot;anthropic 
					trap&quot; for a number of reasons, one of them being the above 
					simple logical conclusion which shows that the supernatural 
					interpretation of the &quot;fine-tuning&quot; is an example of a 
					circular reasoning. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Arguments against 
					the supernatural interpretation of the anthropic 
					coincidences have been advanced from various viewpoints
					<a href="#26">[26</a>, <a href="#27">27</a>, <a href="#28">
					28</a>, <a href="#29">29]</a>, but Miller limits his 
					discussion to a few selected arguments, such as those 
					offered by Dennett [30] which are by no means among the most 
					telling ones. He leaves without discussion many other, much 
					stronger arguments <a href="#26">[26</a>, <a href="#27">27</a>,
					<a href="#28">28</a>, <a href="#29">29]</a>.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Concluding his 
					discussion of anthropic coincidences, Miller actually admits 
					that the very existence of life presupposes the 
					&quot;fine-tuning&quot; of our universe for life's existence. He 
					writes (page 232), &quot;...we knew that we existed, and that 
					alone should have told us, from the beginning, that our 
					universe was one that made life possible. Therefore, we 
					should not be even slightly surprised to learn that the 
					physical constants of gravity, electromagnetism, and the 
					nuclear forces are compatible with life.&quot; This seems to be a 
					very reasonable statement. However Miller continues, 
					&quot;Nevertheless, if we once thought we had been dealt nothing 
					more than a typical cosmic hand, a selection of cards with 
					arbitrary choices, determined at random in the dust and 
					chaos of the big bang, then we have some serious explaining 
					to do.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The second statement 
					has no logical connection with the first one. If we &quot;should 
					not be even slightly surprised&quot; by anthropic coincidences, 
					why do we need any explanation? Explanation is needed when 
					we <i>are</i> surprised. If we are not, we need no 
					explanation. This is a simple logic and Miller strangely 
					seems not to notice the inconsistency of his position on 
					that point. </font></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><a name="boring"><font face="Verdana">
					The boring ruminations</font></h3>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Miller proceeds 
					beyond his discussion of anthropic coincidences, somewhere 
					around page 250 and further, his discourse deteriorates into 
					lengthy and repetitive ruminations regarding the 
					interpretations of the book of Genesis, and similar 
					subjects. Time and time again we see here statements which 
					clearly contradict each other and merge into a nebulous din 
					of little interest.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Miller has noticed 
					the discrepancies in the book of Genesis, like those between 
					Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 which provide incompatible stories 
					about the order of creation of plants, animals and humans. 
					His explanation? The book of Genesis is not about science, 
					it is about spiritual matters. Those who see in the book of 
					Genesis just plain words of ancient writers who had no 
					knowledge of the universe beyond the narrow experience 
					provided by their senses, in Miller's view are guilty of an 
					&quot;extreme literal reading&quot; (page 270). However, he offers no 
					clarification how the supposed hidden spiritual essence of 
					the book of Genesis can be extracted from its apparent 
					contradictory narrative about the six days of creation. 
					Without such clarification, all Miller's mantras about 
					reason supporting his faith remain just words with no 
					evidentiary value. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is an example 
					of an inconsistency in Miller's <i>yin</i> part: On page 272 
					Miller writes about the history of evolutionary development 
					and concludes as follows, &quot;Surely this means that mankind's 
					appearance on this planet was not preordained, that we are 
					here not as a product of an inevitable procession of 
					evolutionary success, but as an afterthought, a minor 
					detail, a happenstance in a history that might just as well 
					have left us out. I agree.&quot;</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How this statement 
					can be reconciled with the fundamental tenets of Christian 
					religion is beyond me (using Miller's own words on page 172 
					which he applied to his bewilderment at Dembski's position). 
					This is a question of simple logic which points to the 
					incompatibility between the statement that the existence of 
					human intellect is a minor detail, a happenstance in 
					history, and the fundamental principle of Judeo-Christian 
					and Islamic faiths according to which humans are the product 
					of a purposeful, deliberate, planned action by God. Miller 
					fails to explain how the two incompatible views can be 
					reconciled. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe the above 
					example suffices to show that a detailed discussion of 
					Miller's effort to substantiate his thesis of complete 
					harmony between his Catholic faith and his scientific views 
					would be hopelessly fruitless.</font></p>
					<h2 align="justify"><a name="conc"><font face="Verdana">5. 
					Conclusion</font></h2>
					</a>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Miller is certainly 
					entitled to his beliefs, whatever they may be. There is no 
					reason to doubt his sincerity. There is a good reason to 
					admire the larger, <i>yang</i> part of his book. There seems 
					to be no reason to take seriously the smaller, <i>yin</i> 
					part.</font></p>
