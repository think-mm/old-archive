				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The species of religious 
                thought called creationism continues to evolve by a process of 
                natural selection. While, as National Center for Science 
                Education executive director Eugenie Scott has pointed out, 
                there has always been a continuum of creationist views from 
                extreme to moderate, we can still identify a few dominant 
                strains. Let us look at the recent history.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to Ronald 
                Numbers, author of the definitive early history, <i>The 
                Creationists </i>(Knopf 1992), the term creationism did not 
                originally apply to all forms of anti-evolution. Opponents of 
                evolution were not always committed to any unified view of 
                creation. However, by the 1920s, the Biblical creation myth 
                became the standard alternative to evolution and the 
                creationists its champion. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In that decade, 
                fundamentalists in the U.S. took over the front line of the 
                battle. Under their influence, three states-Tennessee, 
                Mississippi, and Arkansas-made teaching evolution a crime. 
                Oklahoma prohibited textbooks promoting evolution, and Florida 
                condemned the teaching of Darwinism as &quot;subversive.&quot; </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1925, biology teacher 
                John Scopes was arrested in Dayton, Tennessee, for teaching 
                evolution. This led to the sensational &quot;Monkey Trial,&quot; with 
                Clarence Darrow pitted against three-time losing Democratic 
                presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. Although Scopes 
                was convicted (later overturned on appeal), the trial is still 
                widely regarded as a public-relations triumph for the 
                Darwinians, as depicted in the play and film <i>Inherit the Wind</i>.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<img src="image/stenger.jpg" align="right" width="154" height="233">A new strain of 
                creationism appeared in 1961 with the publication of <i>The 
                Genesis Flood</i> by John C. Whitcomb, Jr. and Henry M. Morris, 
                strongly influenced by an earlier book by George McCready Price. 
                The authors argued that science was compatible with Genesis, and 
                although their scientific claims were not credible, conservative 
                Christians sat up and took notice, recognizing a new strategy 
                for combating hated Darwinism. Around 1970, Morris founded the 
                Institute for Creation Science, which then led a movement to 
                have the new creationism presented in public-school science 
                classrooms. Duane Gish traveled the country giving talks and 
                ambushing naíve scientists in debates before huge, receptive 
                audiences of churchgoers. Arkansas and Louisiana passed laws 
                mandating the teaching of creation science alongside evolution. 
                In 1982, a federal judge in Arkansas tossed out the law in that 
                state, declaring creation science to be religion and not 
                science. The Supreme Court ruled the Louisiana law 
                unconstitutional in 1987. Still, polls in the 1990s indicated 
                that about half of Americans continue to believe that humans are 
                the result of special creation within the last 10,000 years. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">About this time creation 
                science speciated into two main branches, one holding to the 
                more literal Biblical picture of a young Earth and another that 
                attempts to use sophisticated arguments that appear, at least to 
                the untutored eye, more consistent with established science. The 
                second group has developed a new, stealth creationism called 
                Intelligent Design. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Learning from the 
                mistakes of the creation scientists, proponents of Intelligent 
                Design hide their sectarian motives. They have avoided the more 
                egregious scientific errors of the creation scientists, such as 
                the young Earth, and presented this new form of creationism as 
                &quot;pure science.&quot; They claim that design in nature can be 
                scientifically demonstrated and that the complexity of nature 
                can be proved not to have arisen by natural processes alone.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The story of how this 
                strain of creationism is fed and watered by a well-funded 
                conservative Christian organization called the Discovery 
                Institute is fully documented in the excellent recent book by 
                Barbara Forrest and Paul Gross, <i>Creationism's Trojan Horse: 
                The Wedge of Intelligent Design</i> (Oxford, 2004). The clearly 
                stated goal of the Wedge is to &quot;renew&quot; science and culture along 
                evangelical-Christian lines. Intelligent Design has been a 
                wholesale failure, as both science and strategy. None of its 
                scientific claims, especially the work of the main theorists 
                William Dembski and Michael Behe, have stood up under scientific 
                scrutiny. None of their claims is published in scientific 
                journals. Numerous books and articles refute their positions in 
                great detail. Not only have their arguments been shown to be 
                flawed, but in several instances, the factual claims on which 
                they rest have been proven false. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Furthermore, so far 
                Intelligent Design has also failed in the political arena, which 
                is really its primary focus. Numerous attempts to have 
                Intelligent Design taught in science classrooms as an 
                &quot;alternative&quot; to evolution have been successfully fought off by 
                the heroic efforts of scientists and citizens' groups in a 
                number of states. The argument that Intelligent Design should be 
                taught &quot;out of fairness&quot; has been successfully countered by 
                pointing out that only legitimate science belongs in the science 
                classroom. Intelligent Design has been shown to not be science 
                at all but pseudoscience dressed up as science for the purpose 
                of promoting a religious agenda. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Still, creationism is 
                not yet extinct. Recent indications are that another change in 
                its genetic structure has taken place. The new buzzphrase being 
                promoted at school boards and textbook hearings these days is 
                &quot;critical thinking.&quot; Creationists have achieved success in at 
                least one state by writing into lesson plans and core standards 
                the requirement that students have their critical thinking 
                skills developed by studying the arguments against as well as 
                for evolution. Like the &quot;fairness&quot; argument mentioned above, 
                this strikes many members of boards and legislatures as 
                perfectly reasonable. Who can deny the value of teaching 
                critical thinking? And, who can deny the reasonableness of 
                discussing the evidence against a theory as well as for it? The 
                trouble is, what is being written into the new lesson plans and 
                standards are phony examples of evidence against evolution. For 
                example, the Ohio Board of Education has adopted a lesson plan 
                requiring a &quot;critical analysis of evolution.&quot; Here is an example 
                of the type of &quot;brief challenging simple answers&quot; for a 
                grade-ten lesson: &quot;Transitional fossils are rare in the fossil 
                record.&quot; While disagreement exists over precise ancestral 
                groups, empirical evidence for many transitional forms is common 
                and well documented in the scientific literature. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Science is also grossly 
                misrepresented in the Ohio lesson plans. Anomalies are presented 
                as &quot;ideas&quot; rather than observations that disagree with 
                theoretical predictions. Theories are called &quot;suppositions&quot; 
                rather than well-established systems of explanations for large 
                numbers of observations. Science education in the U.S. will be 
                severely damaged if this type of bogus &quot;critical thinking&quot; 
                becomes widespread.</font><p align="justify">&nbsp;<hr color="#000000" width="40%" size="1">
