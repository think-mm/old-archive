                </span></b><font face="Verdana">I read Stephen Hawking's <i>A 
                Brief History of Time</i> in my early teens.&nbsp; I am harking back 
                to a time when chapters on reproduction in my biology textbook 
                were all that took my fancy. &nbsp;I did not enjoy Professor 
                Hawking's style all that much and the reason was obvious: I did 
                not really concentrate.&nbsp; Fast forward to my late teens, I picked 
                up the book as part of my recommended text for A Level Physics.&nbsp; 
                Redolent of all that was astonishing and mysterious, this time I 
                took a lot of interest in Hawking's explanation of the Big Bang 
                theory.&nbsp; I marveled at his intellect and his way of simplifying 
                complex topics on black holes, theory of relativity and quantum 
                mechanics.&nbsp; The book did not answer many questions I had 
                bubbling effervescently in my head but it made me think about 
                the vastness of this stupendous thing we call the universe.&nbsp; It 
                raised the level of my thinking.&nbsp; I could ignore a lot of 
                pettiness around me, all the small, narrow-mindedness that so 
                often engulfs our thought process. </font></p>
    <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">I went on to study 
    economics at university, learning two fundamental laws.&nbsp; That for every 
    economist, there exists an equal and opposite economist. &nbsp;While the second 
    law states: they are both wrong. &nbsp;An unfunny joke to you, if you never read 
    economics but throughout my undergraduate years, I spent time figuring which 
    of the multiple schools of thought stood better.&nbsp; This anecdote comes handy 
    because on Darwin's theory of Evolution, I bet there are a lot of us out 
    there who would dispute the theory.&nbsp; This is more complex than economics; to 
    many it entangles the idea of committing blasphemy on religious grounds.&nbsp; 
    This particular write-up is not about proving whether Darwin's theory is 
    right or wrong.&nbsp; I shall leave it to the experts: scientists and religious 
    scholars.&nbsp; However, it is an alternate take on how we perceive the theory of 
    evolution in Bangladesh and how science, in general, can open the windows to 
    progressive thinking.</font></p>
    <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">The irony of the science 
    lessons I had at school, when dealing with evolution, was the fact that they 
    became the most unscientific exercise ever.&nbsp; Our teacher conveyed evolution 
    to us with an undertone of disbelief and presented with no less enthusiasm 
    than the substitutes hold in a losing match.&nbsp; Before we could get to grips 
    with the concept, and I am not talking about going into minutia details, we 
    were told to be dismissive.&nbsp; In hindsight, I like to think my biology 
    teacher took over the role of a religious preacher for those hours.&nbsp; That 
    was a fine conceit, although some of you would prefer this approach.&nbsp; We did 
    not start asking ridiculous questions, there were none of the ultra 
    progressive loops or digressions.&nbsp; At the same time, thrown in the dark end, 
    of course remorselessly, we seemed to have lost the central narrative – the 
    theory itself!</font></p>
    <p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">In Bangladesh, the 
    bickering legacy of ignorance is exacerbated on us by the poverty of freedom 
    of the mind.&nbsp; The theory of evolution through natural selection sparked so 
    powerful a jolt of recognition that even today I see museums and 
    universities dedicating sections to Darwin's name.&nbsp; I wonder if you, like 
    me, wish that you did not remain oblivious to the mammoth world of genetics, 
    DNA, and so on.&nbsp; The nurturing of the mind is only possible through 
    learning.&nbsp; The parochial mindset of a certain group in Bangladesh, whose 
    Neanderthal approach to establishing their platform is through bombings, 
    have the potential to be heavily influential.&nbsp; One way to discourage the 
    next generation from joining a band of <i>schadenfreude</i> muggers is to 
    condemn that path.&nbsp; For them, it could mean &quot;just a bit of action&quot;, as the 
    tendency to break the law is by far the popular choice in Bangladesh.&nbsp; 
    Therefore, an intelligent alternative would be to give them the knowledge, 
    which in turn would enable them to help themselves with their thought 
    process, aided by scientific analysis and reasoning.&nbsp; The bland part to this 
    is the fact that we are yet to have a magazine that could act as a bridge 
    between the complex world of science and the average reader.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Ours is a generation of colossal confusion.&nbsp; More poignantly, the level 
    could reach cataclysmic heights in no time.&nbsp; If you do not conform to 
    certain social norms, inevitably you will be reduced to being a philistine, 
    perhaps due to, shall I say, unmitigated circumstances.&nbsp; Have you wondered 
    how science is bowled over by the tomfoolery that is passed on from the 
    elderly: not to look into a broken mirror, never to help yourself to a 
    single serving of rice, never to jump over another, et al.&nbsp; The first will 
    bring ill fate, the second will be responsible for drowning me in deep 
    waters and then you shall be doomed to being a dwarf as I leapt over you in 
    our school playground!&nbsp; And tell you what, if you somehow get to see the 
    sole of my Speedo flip-flop, I am almost certain to have a quarrel with 
    you.&nbsp; How about this idea for a bestseller – a collection of all homegrown 
    beliefs and shall we call it <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">The Origin of 
    Superstitions</span>?<br>
    <br>
    If Hemingway taught me how I can be destroyed but not defeated, if Camus got 
    me in a despair with Sissyphusian absurdity, then the likes of Hawking, 
    Sagan, Dawkins and other science writers I cannot recall at this very 
    moment, challenged me to look beyond the &quot;norms&quot;.&nbsp; Social norms, which are 
    really a moronic euphemism for superstition, and we know they only cripple 
    our thought process.&nbsp; On this Darwin Day, I urge you, regardless of your 
    personal beliefs, read all you can.&nbsp; Browse through this site, follow 
    hyperlinks, and even grab hold of a science publication.&nbsp; What do you have 
    to lose?&nbsp; In contrary, you might find cure to some of the superstitions you 
    are conditioned to, you might be able to raise the level of your thinking 
    and at the very least, let me promise you: you won't remain an ignorant 
    anti-Darwinian!</font></p>
