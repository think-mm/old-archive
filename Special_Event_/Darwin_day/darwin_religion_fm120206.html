					<span style="color: #333333">&nbsp;Honoring Charles Darwin, the 
					father of modern biology, Britain has recently put his 
					portrait on the ten-pound note, replacing one bearded 
					Victorian icon, Charles Dickens, with another. New York 
					City's American Museum of Natural History has mounted the 
					most comprehensive exhibition ever offered on the 
					naturalist's life, theories, and achievements that opened 
					for public view in Nov. 19, 2005. The exhibit will travel 
					for the next two years in various prestigious venues in 
					North America and then end up in London's Natural History 
					Museum in time for the celebration in 2009 of the 200<sup>th</sup> 
					anniversary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of 
					the publication of his groundbreaking book, <i>The Origin of 
					Species</i>.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the heartland of the Protestant Christian 
					United States, the birthplace of modern religious 
					fundamentalism, Darwin's name is being invoked for a 
					different reason. His name is being dragged in court cases, 
					lawsuits, and bitterly contested local School Board 
					elections. Exactly 80 years after the infamous Scopes trial 
					in Dayton, Tennessee, Darwin's theory of evolution by 
					natural selection is still considered to be anti-Bible, 
					hence sacrilegious.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:#333333">
					</span><span style="color: #333333">The supporters of 
					creationism, believers in literal interpretation of the Book 
					of Genesis and other biblical narrations of life on earth, 
					have come up with a new name, &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; for 
					creationism and want to push this as a part of science 
					curriculum. All serious scientists, and all serious 
					men/women of religion, of course, oppose the position of the 
					creationists who insist that the Bible's version of creation 
					be taught in science courses as scientific fact. But such 
					are the times we live in -- the religious fundamentalists 
					usually have the sway and get away with murder. &nbsp;</span></font></p>

					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of dollars flow into these religious 
					right wing institutions reinstating their 
					message-disseminating muscle power. The religious 
					broadcasters have enormous influence over the minds of 
					millions of Americans. 51% of Americans outright reject the 
					theory of evolution and believe that the word &quot;image&quot; in the 
					biblical phrase &quot;God created man in His own image&quot; means a 
					picture taken by a camera click. When voters ousted the 
					creationist members of the school board in a High School in 
					Dover, Pennsylvania, in November this year, Pat Robertson of 
					Christian Broadcasting Network blared dire warnings. 
					Citizens of Dover had &quot;voted God out,&quot; so they should not 
					turn to God in case of a looming disaster. &quot;If they have 
					future problems in Dover,&quot; said Robertson, &quot;I recommend they 
					call on Charles Darwin. May be he can help them.&quot;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Darwin such an iconoclast as Robertson is 
					claiming? Does he deserve to be put down as an opposition to 
					God?&nbsp; Since the creation myth is shared by the other 
					Abrahamic faiths, how is the issue dealt with in Judaism and 
					Islam? It is worthwhile to look for answers to these 
					questions, because as silly as Robertson's statements are, 
					this is a cultural controversy of our time that is spilling 
					over into the realms of both science and religion. We should 
					begin by looking at the fascinating man, Darwin, his only 
					voyage round the world, and the compelling private and 
					public drama behind the publication of The Origin of 
					species.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of my notes are taken from the book, <i>
					Darwin and the Beagle</i> (Penguin Books, 1971) by Alan 
					Moorehead, the famed author of <i>The White Nile</i> (1960) 
					and <i>The Blue Nile</i> (1962).&nbsp; Moorehead's book, though 
					meticulously researched, is written in easy narrative style 
					for a general audience, and the Penguin edition is 
					magnificently illustrated by paintings, drawings and 
					sketches made by artists who, in lieu of latter-day 
					photographers, accompanied Darwin in this expedition in 
					1831-36. Moorehead begins his account by depicting a young, 
					twenty-two year old Charles Darwin, bubbling with enthusiasm 
					at the offer of the post of a naturalist on the long voyage. 
					He had just graduated from Cambridge University's Christ's 
					Church, and was about to enter the Church as a country 
					parson when this astonishing offer came to him through the 
					recommendation of his Professor of Botany, John Stevens 
					Henslow, himself a clergyman.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 5, 1831, Darwin was summoned to 
					London to meet Robert FitzRoy, the aristocratic captain of 
					HMS <i>Beagle</i>, a small but very well outfitted ship with 
					a splendid, experienced crew. The two young men got along 
					famously at that meeting, and thus, despite youth, 
					inexperience, and against all odds, Darwin embarked on the 
					greatest adventure of his life - the voyage of the <i>Beagle</i>. 
					It was the voyage, Moorehead reminds us, &quot;that became, as it 
					were, the origin of the Origin of Species, and the basis of 
					those ideas which have since changed all our lives.&quot;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					The Admiralty of Britain was sending off this expedition 
					with two missions: first to continue the charting of South 
					American coast, and secondly to get a more accurate fixing 
					of longitude. But there was another unstated mission. Robert 
					FitzRoy was a deeply religious man who believed every word 
					in the Bible absolutely. It was not unusual to take a 
					naturalist on board a voyage such as this, but FitzRoy had a 
					special object in view, a religious object.</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&quot;The 
					voyage, he believed, would provide a grand opportunity to 
					substantiate the Bible, especially the book of Genesis. As a 
					naturalist, Darwin might easily find many evidences of the 
					Flood and the first appearance of all created things upon 
					the earth.&nbsp; He could perform a valuable service by 
					interpreting his scientific discoveries in the light of the 
					Bible. Darwin, the young clergyman-to-be, was very ready to 
					agree.&nbsp; He too, did not in the least doubt the literal truth 
					of every word in the Bible at this time - it was part of the 
					world he accepted and liked so well - and if he could be of 
					use in this way, well then, that made the prospect of the 
					voyage all the more exciting&quot; (25).</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					Darwin was fortunate also in his family background. His 
					father, Robert, was a doctor and made a small fortune in 
					Shrewsbury, and grandfather Dr. Erasmus Darwin made a great 
					name both as a doctor and as a writer of verse with 
					scientific and evolutionist themes. Darwin later denied that 
					he was influenced by any of his grandfather's poems in any 
					way. His mother was a Wedgwood, the famous family of 
					potters, and he married his first cousin Emma, the daughter 
					of Sir Josiah Wedgwood, his maternal uncle. Charles and Emma 
					had ten children, seven of whom survived, and they lived a 
					genuinely happy family life. The Darwins, in other words, 
					were upper class Whigs and Liberals, very different than the 
					aristocratic, rigid and conservative Tory background of 
					FitzRoy, the captain of the <i>Beagle</i>.</span><span style="color: #333333">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To appreciate the full extent of Darwin's 
					achievement and his inner struggle we should try to get an 
					idea what &quot;creationism&quot; consisted of in Victorian England. 
					It was markedly different than the post-Darwin creationism 
					of the American Protestants. By a series of mystical 
					calculations and computations, Archbishop Ussher and Dr. 
					John Lightfoot of Cambridge University had fixed the actual 
					date of the creation of the world - it was 9 am on Sunday, 
					23 October in 4004 <span style="font-variant:small-caps">b.c.</span> 
					- and this extraordinary pronouncement was printed with all 
					the authority of the Gospel itself in many copies of the 
					Bible that were in circulation at the time.&nbsp; There may have 
					been theological arguments about the interpretation of the 
					facts; but the facts of the Bible were sacrosanct: the world 
					had been created in six days, man was made in His image, all 
					the creatures of earth had sprung into existence at the same 
					instant, and they all survived the Great Flood because Noah 
					had taken two of each species, one male and one female, 
					aboard his Ark.&nbsp; In those days such beliefs were at the 
					heart of nearly everyone's consciousness. If you took away 
					those beliefs, you could shake the very foundation, destroy 
					the society, and mock God Himself! This was unthinkable!&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">Darwin had 
					to be extremely cautious. Ever since his return from the 
					voyage, Darwin had been busy writing up, editing, and 
					revising the materials gathered from the long trip. Full ten 
					years' labor was exerted to edit five volumes of <i>Zoology 
					of the Beagle</i>, after that there was <i>Geology of the 
					Voyage of the Beagle</i> in several parts. His <i>Journal</i> 
					when it came out in 1839, apart from its scientific value, 
					was regarded as one of the best books of travel and 
					adventure ever written. It was translated and published all 
					over the world. But Darwin delayed, and waited for more than 
					twenty-three years before publishing his heretical theories 
					on the origin of the teeming species on earth.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">It should 
					be mentioned here that creationism is a peculiarly Christian 
					debate, and since the Vatican declared in 1996 that there is 
					no conflict between the scientific theory of evolution and 
					the Bible, it is strictly an American Protestant issue. 
					Persecution of heretics is extremely rare in Islamic history 
					and civilization. Islam expressly forbids a clergy, and 
					unlike Catholicism or the Church of England, it does not 
					have a central religious authority. Judaism also does not 
					have a central religious authority.&nbsp; If you don't have a 
					designated central authority, who is to say what is 
					heretical and what is not?&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">Moreover, 
					Islam was a truly global religion within a few centuries of 
					its emergence; with the result that a great deal of cultural 
					improvisation had to take place.&nbsp; Take the example of our 
					premier medieval poet, Sayyid Sultan of 17<sup>th</sup> 
					century Bengal.&nbsp; In his magnum opus, <i>Nabi-Bangsa</i>, he 
					blithely includes Brahma-Vishnu-Maheswar from the Hindu 
					pantheon as being part of our Nabi's genealogy.&nbsp; To Sayyid 
					Sultan, as long as he puts Adam as the first, and Muhammad 
					as the last prophet, he was free to chose his series of 
					nabis (prophets) in between. There had been a marvelous 
					number of Muslim heretics over the ages; so many that Tariq 
					Ali devoted a whole chapterâThe Joy of Heresyâin his 
					recent book, <i>The Clash of Fundamentalisms</i> (2002). 
					There are however, not many Joan of Arcs, Giordano Brunos or 
					Galileo Galileis in Islam. The case of the Sufi maestro 
					Mansur al-Hallaj's execution in 922 AD in Baghdad is a rare 
					example, but even that had more to do with his rattling the 
					self-interests of Shia and Sunni political establishments of 
					the time than for committing religious heresy. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">In light 
					of this, as several Muslim and African intellectuals 
					(including Nobel Laureate, Wole Soywinka) pointed out at the 
					time, what Ayatollah Khomeini did with the issuance of the 
					Salman Rushdie fatwa was not only utterly un-Islamic, but a 
					bad, risible imitation of a Christian Pope or an Archbishop. 
					Lately, I have noticed that the Islamist âwanna-be' fans 
					of all things Christian and medieval are fast becoming 
					subscribers of creationism. Literalism is the vermin at the 
					root of all religious fundamentalisms.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">Back to 
					the Galapagos Islands. It cannot have been easy for Charles 
					Darwin to accept the discoveries that he was making and the 
					conclusions he was forced to draw against the very grain of 
					his own religious upbringing. Over the five years' duration 
					of the <i>Beagle </i>voyage, Darwin knew he was diverging 
					further and further away from the simple views held by 
					FitzRoy.&nbsp; &quot;Disbelief crept over me,&quot; wrote Darwin, &quot;at a 
					very slow rate but was at last complete. The rate was so 
					slow that I felt no distress, and never doubted even for a 
					single second that my conclusion was correct&quot; (qtd by 
					Moorehead, 205).&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">The 
					&quot;disbelief&quot; that Darwin is referring to is not exactly what 
					our &quot;suddenly modern&quot; deshi secularists ignorantly presume 
					it is. As a man of his time, he could not have thoroughly 
					abandoned the idea that the laws of nature might reflect 
					some higher purpose and design of God. Darwin was saying, or 
					at any rate suggesting, that the world had not been created 
					in a week, and certainly not in the year 4004
					<span style="font-variant:small-caps">B.C</span>.&nbsp; It was 
					inconceivably older than this, it had changed out of 
					recognition and was still changing, all the living creatures 
					had changed as well, and man, far from being created in 
					God's image, may have begun something much more primitive. 
					Darwin did not exactly say that man had descended from an 
					ape, in fact what he did believe was&nbsp;&nbsp; modern man and modern 
					apes had diverged in pre-history from a common line of 
					ancestors. These &quot;lines&quot; are not straight, not even crooked, 
					they are sometimes interrupted, severed, but yet strangely 
					continued, and in some cases, stopped dead on the track, 
					vanished from the face of the earth. &quot;In my theory,&quot; Darwin 
					wrote later in his Notebook, &quot;there is no absolute tendency 
					to progression, excepting from favourable circumstances&quot; 
					(from <i>Metaphysics, Materialism and the Evolution of 
					Mind).</i>&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">
					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color: #333333">Darwin's 
					waiting game had its own danger. Another naturalist, Alfred 
					Russel Wallace, who was thinking upon the same lines 
					himself, could forestall his theory. Then, suddenly, in 
					June, 1858, Darwin received a letter from Wallace with an 
					enclosed essay entitled <i>On the Tendencies of Varieties to 
					Depart Indefinite from the Original Type</i>, and a request 
					to send it on to Sir Charles Lyell, the famous geologist, if 
					Darwin thought it was any good.&nbsp; Darwin, as usual, behaved 
					magnanimously. Risking the prospect of his own brilliant 
					theory's originality smashed and all his work towards it 
					rendered worthless, he sent on Wallace's article to Lyell 
					with high recommendation without any hesitation. 
					Fortunately, Lyell and the scientific community knew enough 
					of Darwin's work, and they persuaded him to present a joint 
					paper with Wallace. Next year, in 1859, Darwin published his 
					book, <i>On the Origin of Species by means of Natural 
					Selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the 
					struggle for life. </i>The first edition of 1250 copies sold 
					out on the first day of publication.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in; line-height: 14.4pt" align="justify">

					people were outraged at the idea that they might share a 
					common lineage with animals, and the Church, as expected, 
					was thoroughly aroused. The clergy came out in full force to 
					do the battle at the famous meeting of the British 
					Association in Oxford in June 1860. Darwin was not well 
					enough to attend, but his old teacher, Professor Henslow 
					headed the team of Darwinist scientists. Moorehead gives an 
					amusing account of this meeting, and the book has large 
					reprints of caricatures (by &quot;Ape&quot; from the magazine, <i>
					Vanity Fair</i>) of Darwin, T.H. Huxley, the great 
					naturalist who supported Darwin agqinst Samuel Wilberforce, 
					Bishop of Oxford, and Richard Owen, an anatomist in the 
					clergy camp. &quot;There is something anachronistic,&quot; muses 
					Moorhead, &quot;even absurd, about the whole controversy; it 
					seems to belong, not to the last century, but to Middle 
					Ages, and one has to make a conscious effort of the mind to 
					believe that it really happened&quot;(208). Wonder what he would 
					have to say about Pat Robertson followers in the USA of the 
					21<sup>st</sup> century!&nbsp;</span></font></p>

					produced a galaxy of star-quality Muslim scientists, 
					physicians, astronomers and philosophers, one can not fail 
					to notice that none of them went through this kind of ordeal 
					or clash with the establishment arm of their religion. 
					Mistaking religious myths as the source of scientific 
					information was never a part of Islam's ethos as it 
					obviously had been in the Christian faith all the way up to 
					the nineteenth century, and now in America of the 21<sup>st</sup> 
					century. &quot;God speaks in metaphors,&quot; emphasizes the Qur'an 
					many times. The celebrated Qur'anic verse from Sura Nur 
					(24), from which Islamic mysticism has derived much gnosis 
					and illuminations, from Mansur al-Hallaj to Imam Ghazzali, 
					ends with these words: &quot;And God strikes similitudes for men,

					should be complete these days without paying a tribute to 
					Stephen Jay Gould, who, to my great sorrow, passed away 
					recently at the age of only 63. This Harvard paleontologist 
					was exceptionally brilliant from a very young age. Like his 
					beloved guru Darwin, he had a facility with language.&nbsp; 
					Written with clarity needed to explain complex concepts to a 
					general audience, combined with a superb scientific 
					understanding, his numerous articles and books succeeded in 
					making Charles Darwin a household name to the educated 
					American public. &nbsp;</span></font></p>

					<span style="color:#333333">In his article titled &quot;Nonmoral 
					Nature&quot; (<i>Natural History</i>, vol. 91, no. 2, 1982), for 
					instance, he tackles a highly controversial issue - the 
					religious &quot;readings&quot; of natural events. His primary point in 
					this essay is that the behavior of certain animals in 
					nature, like the ichneumon wasps that inhabit a live 
					caterpillar, as parasites, ruthlessly inflicting pain on a 
					helpless prey, should not be judged by our human moral 
					terms. This issue has presented theologians with an exacting 
					dilemma: if God is good and if creation reveals his 
					goodness, why do nature's victims suffer? By applying 
					Darwinian logic, Gould succeeds in showing how to appreciate 
					the wasps for their efficiency for survival. In this way, he 
					asserts, the act of predation can be seen as nonmoral, that 
					is, neither good nor evil. He says, the ichneumon wasps are 
					a detail, and since natural selection is the law that is 
					regulating details, asking the question &quot;why such cruelty?&quot; 
					is one that is posed only in &quot;our terms&quot; and not considering 
					the fact that nature has its own terms to deal with the 
					issues of survival of creatures. &nbsp;</span></font></p>

					<font face="Verdana"><span style="color:#333333">It is 
					amusing in this context, or rather ironic since it is too 
					serious to be amusing, that modern creationists accuse 
					evolutionists of preaching a specific doctrine called 
					secular humanism and thereby demand equal time for their 
					unscientific and discredited views. If nature is nonmoral, 
					then evolution cannot teach any ethical theory at all.&nbsp; The 
					assumption that it can has abetted a panoply of social evils 
					that ideologies falsely read into nature from their beliefs 
					- eugenics and (misnamed) social Darwinism prominently among 
					them. Not only did Darwin eschew any attempt to discover an 
					antireligious ethic in nature, he also expressly stated his 
					personal bewilderment about such deep issues as the problem 
					of evil. â¦[I]n words that express both the modesty of this 
					splendid man and the compatibility, through lack of contact,
