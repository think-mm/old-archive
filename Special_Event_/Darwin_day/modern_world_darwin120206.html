					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In about three-year 
					time, the world will celebrate the bicentennial birthday of 
					Charles Robert Darwin who hardly needs any introduction from 
					anyone of us. I first heard Darwins name when I was merely 
					in the high school in the late 1950s. Our science teacher 
					told us that humankind had evolved from monkey. On hearing 
					this, there was a roll of laughter in the class. I did not 
					laugh for it was the most bizarre thing that I heard so far 
					in my formative years. When I returned home, I asked my 
					elder brother who I thought knew many science tidbits. But 
					no, he also never heard that humankind had came out of apes. 
					Books were not plentiful in those days, nor were television 
					or other media. Nonetheless, the fact that we evolved from 
					monkey stuck into my head like crazy glue. In the sixties, 
					when I was taking courses in botany, zoology, cytology, 
					genetics, breeding, etc., I was reintroduced to Darwin and 
					his crazy idea of evolution. This time I did not have to 
					look for my elder brother or any other sage to verify 
					whether Charles Darwins scientific theory of evolution had 
					any meat in it. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In my college days 
					in Mymensingh (Bangladesh), I had access to a great library 
					at the university that was good enough for me to quench my 
					thirst for new information. While most of my classmates 
					would attend the Jumma prayer on Sabbath Day (Friday), my 
					time was being spent at the dorm reading books on modern 
					biology. I became worldlier while a majority of my 
					classmates was more interested in afterworld. After knowing 
					that humankind had evolved from apes, I lost interest in the 
					genesis (the chapter of Bible that deals in the birth of 
					heaven, hell, and world including Adam and Eve) and 
					eschatology (the branch of theology that is concerned with 
					the end of this world  Keyamaat). I did not realize that I 
					became a liberated person at that early age. Thanks to 
					Charles Darwin! His seminal findings had set me free from 
					the bondage of religion. My life would have been a total 
					waste without the knowledge engendered by this great sage of 
					nineteenth century. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While musing I 
					thought what this modern world would be sans the findings of 
					Charles Darwin. My logical side of the brain tells me that 
					if Darwin were not born in 1809 someone else who would have 
					been trained naturalist would have discovered that 
					biological species evolved in time from simple to complex 
					organism. It is not true that Darwin figured everything 
					about evolution by himself. By reading a well-researched 
					article in the Net, I learned recently that Charles went to 
					Edinburgh, Scotland, to attend college to become a medical 
					doctor. However, his mind was somewhere else. The last thing 
					he wanted to be a physician like his father and his elder 
					brother. He was a keen observer of animals. There in 
					Edinburgh he befriended some wise men of science 
					(zoologists) with whom he used to converse and exchange 
					ideas. Be mindful that evolution was already an established 
					field by then. The Lamarckian view of evolution was hotly 
					debated in the campus especially in the department of 
					zoology. Darwin used to take a stroll in the campus with 
					other naturalist and take part in colloquium. These 
					intellectual discourses had no doubt nourished young 
					Darwins mind. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If Charles Darwin 
					had become a trained physician as mandated by his family, 
					the scientific theory of evolution would have arrived at a 
					later date. As we all know, science thrives on the findings 
					of others. It is a cumulative thing and not a revolutionary 
					idea. It is a small wonder that when one writes a scientific 
					article the first thing one does is review the past articles 
					written on the same or similar topic by others. In the 
					discussion chapter, one comments on results obtained by 
					others. Science is the most logical subject after math; 
					therefore, discussing others results is a fair thing to do. 
					In light of this view, it is logical that Charles Darwin was 
					familiar with the findings of other naturalists who delved 
					into evolution. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Endowed with a keen 
					mind, Charles Darwin, the amateur naturalist, in 1831 at the 
					age of 22 year set sail for Galápagos Islands (a group of 
					volcanic islands lying along the equator in the Pacific 
					Ocean west of the mainland of Ecuador; the islands are 
					famous for their rare species of fauna, including the giant 
					tortoises for which they are named) on a ship named HMS 
					Beagle. The amateur naturalist stayed in the ship for 5 
					years. However, towards the end of the voyage in 1836 the 
					Beagle spent only 5 weeks in the coastline of Galápagos 
					Islands where Darwin began to formulate his ideas about 
					evolution only after watching the diversity of finches on 
					this remote island. Based on the variation of beaks in 
					finches Darwin hypothesized that from a common ancestor 
					descendants spread out, adapted to different conditions, and 
					eventually gave birth to new species. This seminal idea 
					became the base of his famous theory of evolution. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Charles Darwin was a 
					thoughtful person who knew the upshot of his revolutionary 
					findings, but deep inside him, he was tormented by their 
					implications for organized religion (read Christianity) and 
					peoples belief in God. Probably for this reason alone, 
					Charles Darwin never did publish his magnum opus The Origin 
					of Species by means of Natural Selection until 1859. He 
					must have grappled with the idea that his findings might 
					shake up the pillar of monotheistic religions of the world 
					for 28 years since he made the discovery in the remote 
					island in the Pacific Ocean. Ever since humanity knew 
					Darwins scientific theory of evolution, he was recognized 
					by the scientific world as one of the few intellectuals 
					whose finding would revolutionize and shape up our world. 
					Thus, his name is placed in the same league as Isaac Newton 
					and Albert Einstein. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Consider for a 
					moment the possibility that Charles Darwin was not born in 
					1809. Under this backdrop, what our world would be like 
					right now? Darwin is considered by most biologists of the 
					world to be the person who single-handedly revolutionized 
					the modern field of life sciences. The discipline of 
					evolution had touched every gamut of botany, zoology, 
					microbiology, genetics, molecular biology, pharmacology, 
					genomics, proteomics, and a whole slue of other allied 
					field. Therefore, without his landmark discovery these 
					disciplines would not be in the same state as they are now. 
					As I write this short essay to commemorate the contribution 
					of this lone genius, I am simply awed by his intellect. He 
					was a brave man too! In late nineteenth century, modernity 
					had arrived in Europe but Christianity was still a major 
					force at the time. To go against the powerful institution 
					one had to be immensely brave. And brave was he? </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We learn from 
					reputable biography of Charles Darwin that he first 
					formulated his famous theory of evolution when he was 
					voyaging in HMS Beagle in 1836; however, he withholds 
					publishing the theory until 1859. Some savants had opined 
					that Darwin was willing to delay the publication of his 
					famous theory a little longer had it not for a younger 
					scientist by the name Alfred Russel Wallace who was coming 
					up with a very similar theory. Darwin knew that his theory 
					would knockdown the pillar of Christianity. He did not have 
					to say that he doubted very much the tenets of Christianity; 
					it was axiomatic from the conclusion he drew out of the data 
					he gathered on variations in beak in finches. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This write-up wont 
					be a complete one without mentioning Darwins modern-day 
					detractors. In the West especially in America, we have some 
					obscurants who are calling Darwins findings collectively 
					Darwinism. According to these peddlers of prevarication, 
					the ardent followers of Darwin are called Darwinists. Some 
					preachers and neocons in America are trying their level best 
					to portray the scientific theory of evolution as propounded 
					by Darwin as merely a cultists view. As per Harvard 
					biologist Prof. E.O Wilson, these charlatans have developed 
					a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of 
					faith (such as Maoism). They are the ones who are trying 
					to include Intelligent Design hoax into biology textbooks 
					in high school to cast a doubt in Darwins theory of 
					scientific evolution. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Among a group of 
					intellectuals from Muslim world who have embraced modernity 
					with an open arm, they find no problem with Darwins view 
					about evolution but they fail to see inanity in the Book of 
					Genesis. They think the story of how Satan had enticed Adam 
					and Eve to have sex (eat the forbidden apple) and in the 
					process fell from heaven is all-true. This confused bunch of 
					modernist Muslims are writing articles glorifying the work 
					of Darwin but at the same time, they are trumpeting the 
					virtues of being a religionist. There is no dearth of 
					confused learned scholars like them amongst us. Readers may 
					find them here in this forum. With a stroke of luck, they 
					may find one or two articles where the writers would welcome 
					the celebration of Darwins lifelong work while glorifying 
					such religion as Islam as being a true religion of peace and 
					full of divinity. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am happy to admit 
					that I am an ardent supporter of Darwin. To make my ends 
					meet I do research in the field of modern molecular biology. 
					Our lab generates mutations in a gene to increase its 
					Darwinian fitness by making the gene product more stable. 
					Evolution does this change very slowly but in the 
					laboratory, scientists are speeding up the mutation rate a 
					million-fold. In my real life, I celebrate Darwins 
					monumental findings everyday. And in my musing I think what 
					a waste our life would have been if the world never did 
					produce such genius as Charles Darwin. The worlds 6.25 
					billion folks would still be under the yoke of religion. 
					Therefore, think again about the contribution made by this 
					genius. I for one am glad to know that Darwin was born to 
					emancipate humanity from the clutch of obscurantism or a 
					dark force that is almost a cult like phenomenon. Are you 
					ready to embrace Darwins view and be at peace knowing there 
					is no afterlife? I trust that I have one life to lead; 
					therefore, I am serving humanity by seeking new knowledge. 
					Knowledge is power and it begets wealth and makes a nation 
					prosperous. Am I sounding like an arch capitalist? Then, I 
					beg your pardon.</font></p>
