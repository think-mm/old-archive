		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 6pt" align="center">
		&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">The 
		Torah is Very errant and contradictive to that of scientific facts. &nbsp;The 
		first book of Genesis alone should be enough to invalidate Judaism to 
		any INTELLIGENT person. &nbsp;Sadly, not only is Judaism still one of the 
		world’s leading religions, but it has spawned the most insane theism 
		(Christianity). &nbsp;The goal of this page is to expose the inaccuracies of 
		the Torah, hence shooting down its divine claim. &nbsp;All the verses shall 
		appear in chronological order.&nbsp; Feel free to copy what ever you wish.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">1) 
		The Genesis 1 creation account conflicts with the order of events that 
		are known to science. Genesis 1:1 The earth is created before light and 
		stars, birds and whales before reptiles and insects, and flowering 
		plants before any animals. &nbsp;From science, we know that the true order of 
		events was just the opposite.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">2)
		<i>“And God said, Let there be light”</i> (Genesis 1:3) and <i>“. . .And 
		the evening and the morning were the first day”</i> (Genesis 1 :5), 
		versus <i>“And God said, ‘Let there be light in the firmament of the 
		heaven to divide the day from the night....’ “And God made two lights; 
		the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the 
		night: he made the stars also…&nbsp; And the evening and morning were the 
		fourth day”</i> (Genesis 1 :14-19). &nbsp;These violates two major facts. 
		&nbsp;Light cannot exist without a sun, and secondly, how can morning be 
		distinguished from evening unless there is a sun and moon? &nbsp;Christians 
		try to claim that god is the light he is referring to yet, considering 
		the context it is quite obvious that the light god is speaking of is the 
		light emitted by the sun. &nbsp;Just another feeble attempt at trying to 
		rationalize such a MAJOR blunder.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">3) 
		God spends one-sixth of his entire creative effort (the second day) 
		working on a solid firmament (Genesis 1:6-8).&nbsp; This strange structure, 
		which God calls heaven, is intended to separate the higher waters from 
		the lower waters. &nbsp;This firmament, if it existed, would have been quite 
		an obstacle to our space program.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">4) 
		Plants are made on the third day (Genesis 1:11) before there was a sun 
		to drive their photosynthetic processes (Genesis 1:14-19).</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">5)
		<i>“And God said, ‘Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding 
		seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind…&nbsp; ‘And the 
		evening and the morning were the third day” </i>(Genesis 1:11-13), 
		versus <i>“And God said, ‘Let the waters bring forth abundantly the 
		moving creature that hath life…&nbsp; And God created - great whales, and 
		every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth 
		abundantly…&nbsp; And the evening and the morning were the fifth day”</i> 
		(Genesis 1:20-23). &nbsp;Genesis says that life existed first on the land as 
		plants and later the seas teemed with living creatures. &nbsp;Geological 
		science can prove that the sea teemed with animals and vegetable life 
		long before vegetation and life appeared on land.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">6)
		<i>“And God said, ‘Let the water bring forth abundantly the moving 
		creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the 
		open firmament of heaven” </i>(Genesis 1:20). &nbsp;Birds did not emerge from 
		water.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">7)
		<i>&quot;And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after 
		his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, the beast of the earth after his 
		kind: and it was so.&nbsp; And God made…every thing that creepth upon the 
		earth after his kind…&quot; </i>(Genesis 1:24-25).&nbsp; Science contends that 
		reptiles were created long before mammals, not simultaneously. &nbsp;While 
		reptiles existed in the Carboniferous Age, mammals did not appear until 
		the close of the Reptilian Age.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">8)
		<i>“So God created man in his own image,...male and female created he 
		them”</i> (Genesis 1:27), and <i>“the evening and the morning were the 
		sixth day”</i> (Genesis 1:31). If Adam was created on the 6th day, 
		approximately 6,000 years ago (Bishop Usher’s calculations), then nobody 
		lived before 4,000 B.C. Prehistoric men would be fictitious. &nbsp;By tracing 
		the genealogy of Jesus back 77 generations to Adam, the third chapter of 
		Luke also supports belief in a very young earth. &nbsp;If each man had lived 
		approximately 100 years, then the world would be no more than 9,684 
		(7,700 + 1984) years old. &nbsp;If each of Jesus’ ancestors had lived to be 
		1,000 years old (an age not even reached by Methuselah), the earth would 
		still be only 78,984 (77,000 + 1984) years old, according to 
		creationists.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">9)
		<i>“And to every beast of the earth, and every fowl of the air, and to 
		every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life, I have 
		given every green herb for meat: and it was so”</i> (Genesis 1:30). 
		&nbsp;Carnivorous beasts and fowl do not eat green herbs, nor were all 
		animals originally herbivores. Simply consider tapeworms, vampire bats, 
		mosquitoes, barracudas, tigers, etc.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">10) 
		In Genesis 1, the entire creation takes 6 days (Genesis 1:31), at the 
		end of which the earth and its living things are pretty much as they are 
		today. &nbsp;But we know from modern science that the universe (including the 
		earth and life on earth) evolved slowly over billions of years.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">11) 
		In Genesis 2:7 humans are created instantaneously from dust and breath, 
		whereas they actually evolved over millions of years from simpler life 
		forms. &nbsp;Science can in fact trace back human evolution CONCLUSIVELY 3 .2 
		million years.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">12) 
		God makes the animals (Genesis 2:18) and parades them before Adam to see 
		if any would strike his fancy. &nbsp;But none seem to have what it takes to 
		please him. &nbsp;After making the animals, God has Adam name them all.&nbsp; The 
		naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a while, 
		why Adam would still have to be living for we haven’t even discovered 
		nor named all the species. &nbsp;Also consider the idea of every living 
		creature being brought to the Middle East, that would have killed many 
		animals due to climatic changes.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">13) 
		God curses the serpent, making him crawl on his belly and eat dust 
		(Genesis 3:14).&nbsp; One wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on 
		his tail, perhaps?&nbsp; But snakes don’t eat dust, do they?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">14)
		<i>“There were giants in the earth in those days.”</i> Genesis 6:4 But 
		there is no archaeological evidence for the existence of these giants. 
		&nbsp;Also there is a reference to the “Nephilim” being on the earth. &nbsp;Which 
		is a term used for half angel, half human.&nbsp; Why is there no 
		archaeological evidence for the existence of the Nephilim either?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">15) 
		Noah is told to make an ark that is 450 feet long (Genesis 6:14-15).&nbsp; 
		The largest wooden ships ever built were just over 300 feet, and they 
		required diagonal iron strapping for support. &nbsp;Even so, they leaked so 
		badly that they had to be pumped constantly. &nbsp;Are we to believe that 
		Noah, with no shipbuilding knowledge and no shipbuilding tradition to 
		rely upon, was able to construct a wooden ship that was longer than any 
		that has been built since?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">16) 
		Whether by twos or by sevens, Noah takes male and female representatives 
		from each species of <i>“every thing that creepeth upon the earth”</i> 
		(Genesis 7:8). &nbsp;Now this must have taken some time, along with expert 
		knowledge of taxonomy, genetics, biogeography, and anatomy. &nbsp;How did 
		Noah manage to collect the endemic species from the New World, 
		Australia, Polynesia, and other remote regions entirely unknown to him?&nbsp; 
		How, once he found them, did he transport them back to his Near Eastern 
		home? &nbsp;How could he tell the male and female beetles (there are more 
		than 500,000 species) apart?&nbsp; How did he know how to care for these new 
		and unfamiliar animals? &nbsp;How did he find the space on the ark? &nbsp;How did 
		he manage to find and care for the hundreds of thousands of parasitic 
		species or the hundreds of thousands of plant species? &nbsp;(Plants are 
		ignored in the Genesis account, but the animals wouldn’t last long if 
		the plants died in the flood.)&nbsp; No, wait, don’t tell me, a miracle 
		happened, millions of them.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">17) 
		All of the animals boarded the ark <i>“in the selfsame day”</i> (Genesis 
		7:13-14).&nbsp; Since there were several million species involved, they must 
		have boarded at a rate of at least 100 per second.&nbsp; How did poor Noah 
		and his family make sure that the correct number of each species entered 
		through the door and then get them all settled into their proper living 
		quarters so efficiently? &nbsp;I wish the airline companies could do as well!</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">18) 
		The flood covered the highest mountain tops (Mount Everest?) with 
		fifteen cubits to spare (Genesis 7:20).&nbsp; Where did all the water come 
		from? &nbsp;Where did it all go? &nbsp;Why is there no evidence of such a massive 
		flood in the geological record?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">19) 
		When the animals left the ark (Genesis 8:19), what would they have 
		eaten? &nbsp;There would have been no plants after the ground had been 
		submerged for nearly a year. &nbsp;What would the carnivores have eaten? 
		&nbsp;Whatever prey they ate would have gone extinct. &nbsp;And how did the New 
		World primates or the Australian marsupials find there way back after 
		the flood subsided?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">20) 
		Noah kills the <i>“clean beasts”</i> and burns their dead bodies for God 
		(Genesis 8:20).&nbsp; According to Genesis 7:8 this would have caused the 
		extinction of all “clean” animals since only two of each were taken onto 
		the ark. &nbsp;So why is it that we still have “clean” animals?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">21) 
		God is filled with remorse for having drowned his creatures in the 
		flood. &nbsp;He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever the animals 
		see it they will remember God’s promise not to do it again (Genesis 
		9:13).&nbsp; But rainbows are caused by the nature of light, the refractive 
		index of water, and the shape of raindrops. &nbsp;There were rainbows 
		billions of years before humans existed.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">22)
		<i>“The whole earth was of one language”</i> (Genesis 11:1).&nbsp; But this 
		could not be true, since by this time (around 2400 BCE) there were 
		already many languages, each unintelligible to the others.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">23) 
		(Genesis. 11:4) According to the Tower of Babel story, the many human 
		languages were created instantaneously by God (Genesis 11:9)&nbsp; But 
		actually the various languages evolved gradually over long periods of 
		time.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">24) 
		(Genesis 14:14) Abram goes into pursuit looking for his captive relative 
		in the city of Dan. &nbsp;The problem here is that the city of Dan did not 
		exist until over 300 years after Moses died. &nbsp;How is it that Abram could 
		enter the city of Dan, when the city did not even exist?</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">25) 
		Jacob displays his (and God’s) knowledge of biology by having goats 
		copulate while looking at streaked rods. &nbsp;The result is streaked baby 
		goats&nbsp;(Genesis 30:37). &nbsp;The author of Genesis (God?) believed that 
		genetic characteristics of the offspring are determined by what the 
		parents see at the moment of conception. &nbsp;This is a laughable belief. 
		&nbsp;Ask any animal husbandrist.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">26) 
		Camels don’t divide the hoof (Leviticus 11:4). &nbsp;This statement is 
		completely moronic for every TEENAGER knows what a “camel toe” and how 
		it used to describe a specific split.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">27) 
		The bible says that hares and conies are unclean because they <i>“chew 
		the cud”</i> but do not part the hoof (Leviticus 11:5-6).&nbsp; But hares and 
		coneys are not ruminants and they do not “chew the cud.”</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">28) 
		Bats are birds to the biblical God&nbsp;(Leviticus 11:13-19 &amp; Deuteronomy 
		14:11-18).</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">29) 
		Some birds have four feet (Leviticus 11:20-21).</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">30) 
		If there is a God, there is one thing we know for sure about him: He 
		really likes insects (particularly beetles). &nbsp;There are more species of 
		insects, by far, than all other species of life on earth. &nbsp;As JBS 
		Haldane said, <i>“he has an inordinate fondness for beetles.”</i>&nbsp; Yet 
		insects are said to have four legs in Leviticus 11:22-23.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">31) 
		Unicorns have never existed, yet they are said to in Deuteronomy 33:17.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt"><font face="Verdana">32) 
		Fiery serpents have NEVER existed yet Numbers 21:6 claims they do and TO 
		THIS DAY STILL inhabit certain cities.</font></p>
