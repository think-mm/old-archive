						<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was on a glorious Autumn afternoon 
						when I was asked to go and sit with Charles Darwin. He 
						was almost bedridden for some months before he died. 
						Propped up with pillows, his features seemed to be lit 
						up with pleasure as I entered the room. He waved his 
						hand towards the window as he pointed out the beautiful 
						sunset seen beyond, while in the other he held an open 
						Bible which he was always studying. </font> </p>
						<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;What are you reading now?&quot; I asked.

						</font> </p>
						<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I made some allusions to the strong 
						opinions expressed by many unbelievers on the history of 
						the creation and then their treatment of the earlier 
						chapters of the book of Genesis. He seemed distressed, 
						his fingers twitched nervously and a look of agony came 
						across his face as he said, &quot;I was a young man with 
						unformed ideas. I threw out queries, suggestions, 
						wondering all the time over everything. And to my 
						astonishment the ideas took like wildfire. People made a 
						religion of them.&quot; Then he paused and after a few more 
						sentences on the holiness of God and the grandeur of 
						this Book, looking at the Bible which he was holding 
						tenderly at the time, he said: </font> </p>
						<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I have a summer house in the garden 
						which holds about thirty people. It is over there 
						(pointing through the open window). I want you very much 
						to speak here. I know you read the Bible in the 
						villages. Tomorrow afternoon I should like the servants 
						on the place, some tenants and a few neighbors to gather 
						there. Will you speak to them?&quot; </font> </p>
						<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;What shall I speak about?&quot; I asked.
						</font>
						</p>
						<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Christ Jesus,&quot; he replied in a clear

						salvation. Is not that the best theme? And then I want 
						you to sing some hymns with them. You lead on your small 
						instrument, do you not?&quot; </font> </p>
						<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The look of brightness on his face I 
						shall never forget, for he added, &quot;If you take the

								Lady Hope addressed a gathering of young men and 
								women at the educational establishment founded 
								by the evangelist Dwight Lyman Moody at 
								Northfield, Massachusetts. She had, she 
								maintained, visited Darwin on his deathbed. He 
								had been reading the Epistle to the Hebrews, had 
								asked for the local Sunday school to sing in a 
								summerhouse on the grounds, and had confessed: 
								‘How I wish I had not expressed my theory of 
								evolution as I have done.’ He went on, she said, 
								to say that he would like her to gather a 
								congregation since he ‘would like to speak to 
								them of Christ Jesus and His salvation, being in 
								a state where he was eagerly savouring the 
								heavenly anticipation of bliss.’</p>
								<p align="justify">“With Moody's encouragement, 
								Lady Hope's story was printed in the <i>Boston</i>
								<i>Watchman</i> <i>Examiner</i>. The story 
								spread, and the claims were republished as late 
								as October 1955 in the <i>Reformation</i> <i>
								Review</i> and in the Monthly Record of the Free 
								Church of Scotland in February 1957. These 
								attempts to fudge Darwin's story had already 
								been exposed for what they were, first by his 
								daughter <u>Henrietta</u> after they had been revived 
								in 1922. ‘I was present at his deathbed,’ she 
								wrote in the <i>Christian</i> for February 23, 
								1922. ‘<b>Lady Hope was not present during his last 
								illness, or any illness.</b> I believe he never even 
								saw her, but in any case she had no influence 
								over him in any department of thought or belief. 
								<b>Darwin never recanted any of his scientific views, 
								either then or earlier. We think the story of 
								his conversion was fabricated</b> in the U.S.A. . . 
								. The whole story has no foundation whatever.’”

								the clearest evidence would be requisite to make 
								any sane man believe in the miracles by which 
								Christianity is supported,—and that the more we 
								know of the fixed laws of nature the more 
								incredible do miracles become,—that the men at 
								that time were ignorant and credulous to a 
								degree almost incomprehensible by us,—that the 
								Gospels cannot be proven to have been written 
								simultaneously with the events,—that they differ 
								in many important details, far too important, as 
								it seemed to me to be admitted as the usual 
								inaccuracies of eye witnesses;—by such 
								reflections as these, which I give not as having 
								the least novelty or value, but as they 
								influenced me, <b>I gradually came to disbelieve 
								in Christianity as a divine revelation.</b> The 
								fact that many fake religions have spread over 
								large portions of the earth like wildfire had 
								some weight with me. But I was very unwilling to 
								give up my belief; I feel sure of this, for I 
								can remember often and often inventing 
								day-dreams of old letters between distinguished 
								Romans, and manuscripts being discovered at 
								Pompeii or elsewhere, which confirmed in the 
								most striking manner all that was written in the 
								Gospels. But I found it more and more difficult, 
								with free scope given to my imagination, to 
								invent evidence which would suffice to convince 
								me. Thus disbelief crept over me at a very slow 
								rate, but was at last complete. The rate was so 
								slow that I felt no distress, and have never 
								since doubted even for a single second that my 
								conclusion was correct.&quot;</p>
