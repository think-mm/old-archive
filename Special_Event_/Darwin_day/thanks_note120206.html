					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We at Mukto-Mona 
					would like to thank everyone who has helped make the 
					celebration of Darwin Day a success. Our thanks are due to 
					everyone who helped make this event a success, and, in 
					particular to those who have helped us with the special page 
					that we have dedicated to the occasion on our website. Prof 
					Eric Chaisson of the Wright Center for Science Education at 
					Tufts University is to be thanked for letting us use his 
					page design and graphics on our page in particular. Thanks 
					are also due to Prof. Victor Stenger who consented to giving 
					us an interview for this occasion. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
					Among organizations that have come forward with messages of 
					support and solidarity, the Center for Inquiry is an 
					organization that has mentored and helped us for a long 
					time. We would like to individually thank Prof Paul Kurtz, 
					Dr Austin Dacey and  Susan Jacoby for their separate 
					messages of encouragement. Prof Narendra Nayak, President of 
					the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations is someone 
					whom we consider one of us. He has always been supportive of 
					our work and has freely given us his writings on his many 
					exposes of charlatans in India and outside. Our thanks are 
					due to Prof Nayak for his warm message the instant he became 
					aware of the fact that Mukto-Mona was going to celebrate 
					Darwin Day. Prof Newton Joseph whose Atheist Fellowship has 
					offered us permission to post his writing on Mukto-Mona, is 
					someone whose work our members would be seeing regularly in 
					the future. Our thanks are due to Prof Newton for his 
					encouragement and support. Leo Igwe, recipient of the 
					Freidenkers’ award for 2005, whose articles and dispatches 
					are frequently published on our pages, is a friend to 
					Mukto-Mona who has joined in the celebrations with a zeal that is 
					typical of him, and we thank him for his always enthusiastic 
					support. Our next two supporters, Pamela Taylor, Co-Chair of 
					the Progressive Muslim Union and Tarek Fatah of the Canadian 
					Muslim Congress are religious members who have offered us 
					their support in bringing the message of Darwin Day to the 
					Muslim community. While it is commonly portrayed in media 
					that majority members of today’s Muslim community are 
					dogmatic, superstitious and like to live in 7<sup>th</sup> 
					century world, the strong support from Pamela Taylor of the 
					Progressive Muslim Union and Tarek Fatah of Canadian Muslim 
					Congress for upholding Darwinism shows definitely the bright 
					side of the moon. Prof Ajoy Roy has been one of our guiding 
					lights, someone who has always had words of encouragement 
					and enthusiastic support to us in our endeavors. Our thanks 
					are due to him for his constant support. We live in an age 
					where cinema influences peoples’ thoughts probably to a much 
					greater extent than any other medium. Syed Hasan Imam, the 
					renowned actor and film personality from Bangladesh has 
					shown his solidarity with Mukto-Mona on this occasion in a 
					gesture that is much appreciated. Robyn Johannes, President 
					of the Union des Athees in Europe has also extended his warm 
					support and given us his views on the importance of 
					celebrating this occasion. Our thanks are also due to Prof 
					Abdus Shahid for his warm greetings from New Jersey, and 
					scientists and researchers Manju Biswas and Dr S I Shelley. 
					We must offer our thanks to members of the press who have 
					come forward to offer their support - Aminul Islam Bedu and 
					ABM Saleh Uddin are two senior journalists from Bangladesh 
					and Quazi A. Haque, the Senior Development Engineer of Dade 
					Behring Inc. who have offered words of encouragement and expressed their 
					solidarity on this occasion. And, our final thanks are due 
					to our members and readers. We hope that the effort that we 
					have put into designing this page and producing it brings 
					you material that you enjoy reading. We invite, as always, 
					your views on the matters under discussion here. But, first 
					of all, we invite you to celebrate the cause of Science, 
					Humanism and Rationalism in this secular festival. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A Very 
					Happy Darwin Day and Humanist future to everyone.</font></p>
