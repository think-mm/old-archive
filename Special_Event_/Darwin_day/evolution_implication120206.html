				<div class="doc-layout-body">
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A lot of the debate 
					on evolution is focused on whether evolution has occurred or 
					not. Defenders of evolution take great pains to offer the 
					evidence and logic in support of evolution and to refute the 
					position of creationists. But even many of the subscribers 
					to the notion of evolution do not grasp the full 
					implications of the fact of evolution. That will be my focus 
					in this essay. The FACT of evolution is beyond debate, the 
					detailed mechanism is not. My essay assumes the fact of 
					evolution as a given. The simple fact of evolution has 
					profound implications that can have a tremendous impact on 
					the way one looks at life and it's various aspects including 
					morality, values, social customs and human behaviour in 
					general. When I refer to evolution, it will mean all the 
					detailed insights obtained through the research in the 
					fields of evolutionary biology/psychology. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The lesson of 
					evolution is that all life forms including humans arose out 
					of an incremental evolution from a primitive life form over 
					billions of years by a purely natural process and that the 
					primitive life form itself arose out of an incremental 
					evolution of complex molecules in the prebiotic atmospheres 
					of early earth through purely chemical processes, called 
					chemical evolution. Since the laws of physics is the 
					ultimate governing principle behind all natural processes, 
					the conclusion we can draw is that evolution, and thus all 
					life forms are results of the laws of physics. One is forced 
					to conclude this by pure logic and evidence. Denying this 
					simple fact is tantamount to positing a &quot;vital or divine&quot; 
					force driving life forms, humans in particular. The 
					temptation to deny this fact is strong, specially because of 
					the consciousness of human mind, which is intriguing and 
					difficult to explain precisely by natural laws. Even many 
					freethinkers who claim to believe in evolution unwittingly 
					deny this fact when they refer to &quot;human spirit&quot;, and 
					passionately champion many of the &quot;humanistic ideals&quot;, 
					saying that humans are not machines, that love, morality and 
					&quot;human values&quot; are not subject to mechanical laws etc. We 
					have seen in Mukto-Mona many freethinkers making the point 
					that morality is not subject to science or that science 
					cannot be used to formulate morality. While it is true that 
					science cannot be used to formulate morality, but it is also 
					not true that anything else can be used to formulate 
					morality either. So that point cannot be used to propose 
					one's own favored moral views to counter the moral views 
					putatively based on science that happen to contradict their 
					favored views. But one thing that can be stated with 
					certainty is that the notion of morality, as a product of 
					evolution, is certainly a consequence of scientific laws 
					(physics). So even though humans cannot use science to 
					formulate morality, morality itself is a product of 
					scientific laws. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The cold, stark fact 
					is that since all life forms are results of pure natural 
					processes dictated by the laws of physics, hence all aspects 
					of life, including consciousness, love, morality are 
					necessary (evolutionary) consequences of the same natural 
					laws. This simple, yet profound fact is hard to accept even 
					by many secular humanists, let alone theists. To say that 
					any aspect of life is not subject to the laws of physics is 
					to say that that aspect is subject to an (ill-defined) 
					&quot;divine force&quot;, &quot;soul&quot; etc. Pure and simple. There is no in 
					between. It is one of those either or cases. Any attempt to 
					have it both ways, just because it sounds politically 
					correct or appeals to one's taste will be intellectually 
					disingenuous. Many nontheists argue that biology (thus 
					evolution) is not subject to the laws of physics. That is a 
					subtle manifestation of yet another attempt to retain some 
					semblance of a divine factor (by implication, by denying the 
					naturalness of biology). This position is taken by 
					philosopher Nancy Cartwright. In the book :
					<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521785723">
					&quot;The Large, the Small and the Human Mind&quot;</a> (based on a 
					series of three lectures in Cambridge's Tanner Series on 
					Human Values), she challenges the assertion by Stephen 
					Hawking that chemistry is a consequence of physics, and 
					biology is a consequence of chemistry and thus human mind is 
					a consequence of the laws of physics. Of course professional 
					biologist/chemists (Richard Dawkins, Peter Medawar and Peter 
					Atkins for example) do not have this illusion and are fully 
					aware of this epistemological chain from physics to biology. 
					Suffice it to say that this epistemological chain from 
					physics to biology should be fairly obvious to anyone with a 
					moderate understanding of physics and biology and capable of 
					critical thinking. One simple observation can help: Most 
					chemistry books devote their first few chapters on the 
					physics of atoms and molecules, and most biology books 
					devote their first few chapters on organic chemistry </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The skeptical view 
					questioning this epistemological chain is only expressed by 
					non-scientists. Coincidence? Not at all. Let me belabor this 
					point a bit more and cite some quotes from scientists on 
					this physics--&gt;biology chain. While it is true that any view 
					cannot be justified by solely resorting to an argument from 
					authority, nevertheless this citation helps to reinforce 
					this assertion of the epistemological chain, because there 
					is no similar example of scientists expressing a view 
					contradicting this. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let me cite some 
					quotes of various scientists in support of the above 
					epistemological chain. Nobel Laureate Watson of DNA fame 
					said &quot;In the last analysis, there are only atoms. There's 
					just one science, Physics; everything else is social work&quot; 
					in his lecture at the London Institute of Contemporary Arts 
					in 1985. This view is also echoed by Stephen Hawking and 
					Steven Weinberg. Hawking nicely summarizes this view as: 
					Biology-&gt;Chemistry-&gt; Physics, in the book &quot;The Large, the 
					Small and the Human Mind&quot;. Steven Weinberg says in his book 
					&quot;Facing Up&quot;, p-22-3: &quot;No biologist today will be content 
					with an axiom about biological behaviors that could not be 
					imagined to have a more fundamental level. That more 
					fundamental level would have to be the level of Physics and 
					chemistry, and the contingency that the earth is billions of 
					years old&quot;. Biologist Richard Dawkins (in &quot;The Blind 
					Watchmaker&quot;) states that Physicists have to come into the 
					scene at the end of the long chain of reasoning to explain 
					evolution of life to complete the last but not the least 
					significant step. Molecular Biologist Franklin Harold says 
					in his wonderful book
					<a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/LifeSciences/MolecularCellBiology/?ci=0195163389&view=usa">
					&quot;The Way of the Cell&quot;</a>, p-4: &quot;We have ample reason to 
					believe that every biological phenomena, however complex, is 
					ultimately based on chemical and physical interactions among 
					molecules&quot; and reinforces this in his epilog : &quot;The bedrock 
					premise of this book book is that life is a material 
					phenomenon, grounded in chemistry and physics. Physicist
					<a href="http://www.edge.org/pagels_dedication.html">Heinz 
					Pagels</a> wrote in his book &quot;The Dreams of Reason&quot;, p-49: 
					&quot;Biological systems are extremely complex <b>Quantum 
					mechanical</b> entities functioning according to 
					well-defined rules&quot;. Zoologist and award winning science 
					writer Colin Tudge says (Independent on Sunday, Jan 25, 
					1998): &quot;There are no biological laws, apart from the <i>
					underlying</i> laws of physics, and technology might 
					anything that does not break these bedrock laws&quot;. In the 
					book &quot;Our Living Multiverse: A Book of Genesis in 0+7 
					Chapters&quot;, alternately titled as &quot;Origins of Our Existence : 
					How Life Emerged in the Universe&quot; author Fred Adams (Univ. 
					of Michigan Physics Professor) writes: </font></p>

						threshold, the system becomes alive. But the details of 
						this transition remain shrouded in mystery. In spite of 
						this gaping hole in our understanding, however, 
						biological processes are driven by the same laws of 
						physics that describe stars and planets. The concept of

					</blockquote>
					<font face="Verdana">As a final example renowned biologist 
					Earnst Mayr wrote in his book &quot;The growth of Biological 
					Thoughts ('82): &quot;Every biologist is fully aware of the fact 
					that molecular biology has demonstrated decisively that all 
					processes in living organisms can be explained in terms of 
					Physics and chemistry&quot;(As cited in Weinberg,&quot;Facing Up&quot;, 
					p-19) </font>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me digress more 
					into this issue as it is vital to the &quot;Darwinian&quot; view of 
					life. By Darwinian I mean the view that life is a product of 
					natural process (i.e processes governed by the laws of 
					physics). It is now understood that the fundamental 
					constituents of matter (electrons, quarks) follow the laws 
					of physics. It is also understood that matter, living or 
					non-living, are composed solely of these fundamental 
					elements. No life forms (dead or alive) has been found to 
					contain any element other than these fundamental elements.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now if we know that 
					the individual elements obey the laws of physics then it 
					stands to reason that an aggregate of these constituens must 
					also be subject to the laws of physics. If one electron, 
					quark or string obeys the laws of physics then a system of n 
					electrons and quarks (n is very large, for a living object) 
					must also act according to the laws of physics. To say that 
					a human is not just a product of the laws of physics but 
					more, is NOTHING BUT that old vitalism in disguise. There is 
					no third possibility. Either physics or an unknowable entity 
					(God/Soul..) dictates the actions of the system of electrons 
					and quarks called humans. I am not saying that all is known 
					about physics. The knowledge of physics itself is a 
					continually expanding horizon. By Physics in this essay I 
					will mean tht totality of known and yet to be known laws 
					that govern the evolution of the universe. Now let me 
					clarify a VERY important point. Just because life is 
					governed by the laws of Physics, that doesn't mean that 
					every aspect of life can be DERIVED by the laws of physics. 
					Let me illustrate this point with a very simple example. We 
					know particles/objects obey the laws of gravitation. Using 
					the laws of graviation we can precisely predict how a two 
					particle system (like a star with one planet) will move. The 
					orbit can be predicted precisely, or conversely the observed 
					trajectory of two particle system can be explained precisely 
					by the equations of gravity. Now just add one more particle 
					to this system. No one can PRECISELY predict the exact orbit 
					that a three particle system. That is because the laws of 
					gravitation are non-linear. A non-linear equation cannot be 
					solved exactly. So the observed trajectories of the 
					particles in a three particle system cannot be exactly 
					explained/derived by the laws of gravitation. Do we then say 
					that a miracle/divine force is governing the three particle 
					motion? Obviously not. Even though the observed trajectories 
					of the particles cannot be explained/derived by the laws of 
					gravitation, the important fact is that they do not violate 
					the law either. And since there is no evidence that a third 
					unknown force enters into the picture as soon as a third 
					particle is added to a two particle system, thus the fact 
					still remains that the laws of graviation determine the 
					trajectories of three or any number of particles, even 
					though we can only derive the trajectories of only a two 
					particle system. Now extend this argument to humans. A human 
					is enormously complex system of trillions of particles 
					interacting with not just gravitational force but 
					electro-weak and strong forces as well. If we cannot even 
					precisely determine the behaviour of three particle systems, 
					it would be naive to expect to be able to explain the 
					behaviour of a human being in terms of the laws of physics. 
					There is no fundamental difference between living and 
					non-living matter, the difference is due to the complexity 
					and emergent effects. Laws of Physics do control the 
					behaviour of all matter, living, or non-living. No vital 
					prcesses of a living organism, viz. metabolism, reproduction 
					etc, involve any mechanism that violates or does not follow 
					any known laws of Physics, like the law of conservation of 
					energy, law of entropy etc. And since no living object has 
					displayed any property that has violated the known laws of 
					physics, we can draw the conclusion that that any property 
					(including emotions, beliefs etc) of humans are ultimately 
					DUE to the laws of Physics. To deny that will clearly be 
					tantamount to invoking some mysterious force somewhere (Like 
					in some religious texts, a &quot;soul&quot; is said to be implanted 
					into the embryo at some point). In the evolutionary 
					paradigm, life and death of any life forms are different 
					states of matter. No mysterious force enters into a living 
					body and leaves the body after death. Non-living matter 
					(including a corpses) are in thermodynamic equlibrium, 
					living matters are in highly non-equlibrium thermodynamic 
					state. Just as a piece of iron can be in a magnetized state 
					or non-magnetized state with no change in its material 
					composition. Or just as a computer running a program is one 
					state of the computer and a computer shut down is another 
					state of the computer, with nothing entering or leaving the 
					computer. One can say that that a human started and stopped 
					the computer. But that human is also a system governed by 
					the laws of physics and the human+computer system is thus 
					acted on also solely by the laws of physics which cause the 
					human to start and stop the computer (Alternating between 
					two states). EVERY PHENOMENA in universe is coded into the 
					laws of physics. Our entire universe is a system of 
					incredibly large number of systems of particles (of which a 
					human is a subsystem). A human is a very specialized complex 
					system, and the laws of complexity determines its state, 
					including the state of being alive or dead. It is the laws 
					of complexity that give rise to the action of death genes 
					responsible for the natural death of humans. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All this may sound 
					like the much dreaded idea of reductionism, but reductionism 
					or wholism is a term coined by arm chair philosophers, not 
					scientists. There is no *scientfic* concept called 
					reductionism or wholism. Science is about seeking and 
					formulating statements of (tentative) truth about reality 
					based on the best evidence available. The fact that even in 
					physics sometimes the whole is not just the sum of its parts 
					in the sense that the precise motion or properties of an 
					aggregate is not exactly derivable in terms of the 
					properties of the individual constituents, can be labelled 
					wholism, but that labelling does not dismiss the fact that 
					the properties of the whole is still ultimately due to the 
					properties of the fundamental constituents, not something 
					beyond the laws of physics. The motive behind coining those 
					labels is the same, a subtle attempt to retain a semblance 
					of some &quot;divine&quot; factor in life, a refusal to accept that 
					life can be totally a result of natural process. By denying 
					that biology is a consequence of physics, they wish to leave 
					open a divine intervention on biological process (thus life) 
					not explainable by or subject to natural laws. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now on to the main 
					theme of my essay, which is the implication of this simple, 
					yet profound insight. One immediate implication is the 
					illusion of &quot;I/me/we&quot;. When&quot;we&quot; say &quot;we&quot; there is an implied 
					existence of an entity beyond our physical body, acting as a 
					driver/engine of &quot;our&quot; body. &quot;I&quot; will stop quoting &quot;I&quot;, 
					&quot;we&quot;... from this point on for simplicity, but I will use 
					these words in the sense of an identifying label. But as it 
					should be clear now that there is nothing external or 
					internal to the physical body dicating the action of human 
					body that is not part of the body itself. In fact 
					consciousness is an emergent property of matter, brain in 
					this case. Emergent properties are manifestations of 
					complexity in chaotic systems, i.e systems that follow 
					non-linear equations and are composed of large number of 
					elements. Such systems exihibit consistent patterns that can 
					be described quantitatively (by the laws of complexity) but 
					because of the inherent non-linearity of the underlying laws 
					of physics, the laws of complexity cannot be derived in 
					terms of the laws of physics exactly. Human brain is the 
					prime example of a complex system. It is not just a random 
					collection of billions of neurons, but an organ that is a 
					result of millions of years of evolution, thus ultimately a 
					product of the laws of physics. And the synaptic connections 
					of the brain in the cerebral cortex is a result of hundreds 
					of thousands of years of evolution. And it is the synaptic 
					connections the brain that endows it with the emergent 
					property called consciousness, unique to each individual 
					because of the uniqueness of the synaptic connections of 
					each human brain. This is what neurologist Joseph Ledoux 
					calls
					<a href="http://www.cns.nyu.edu/ledoux/synapticself/synaptic_review.htm">
					The Synaptic Self</a>. When we refer to I or we, we are 
					really referring to the synapatic connections of the I/we. 
					Our every action and thought (Which defines a person) is 
					ultimately determined by the laws of physics through the 
					medium of the synaptic connections of the brain. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The implication of 
					the above is that there is no intrinsic meaning of the 
					notion of &quot;Free will&quot;. Whatever act we commit or whatever we 
					think/believe are the ultimate result of the laws of 
					physics. If we carefully stare at the cliche &quot;Yes, we can do 
					whatever we choose to do, we have free will, humans are not 
					robots, they are thinking, living beings with mind, emotions 
					and sense of right and wrong and ability to choose between 
					them&quot; we will see the fallacy in it. All the &quot;we's in those 
					statements really refer to the person's brain. The free will 
					itself is an outcome of the laws of physics working in the 
					brain. Just because we have an illusory perception of free 
					will, that does not change the fact that every act and 
					thought are ultimately determined by the laws of physics. 
					Yes, humans do have choices available, but which choice will 
					be made in a given situation is ultimetely determined by 
					laws of physics. We may have the illusions that &quot;we&quot; made 
					the choice freely, but as I argued the &quot;we&quot; itself is a 
					system that works according to the laws of physics. There is 
					no player other than the brain and the laws of physics in 
					the matter of choice. A free willed choice is an illusion 
					inside the brain of the human making that choice. There is 
					no will free from the laws of physics. We are truly puppets 
					on a string. The string being the &quot;Laws of Physics&quot;, or 
					&quot;string&quot; theory (no pun intended). Some proponents of free 
					will invoke the randomness inherent in in all of nature's 
					processes to justify the existence of free will. That is a 
					flawed position. For one thing randomness is a relative 
					notion. With the entire universe being a large syetem with 
					large number of elements, one part may seem to be random 
					with respect to another part. But the entire universe as a 
					whole is determinsitic, governed by the laws of physics. 
					There is no random act that occurs violating or not required 
					by the laws of physics. The timing of the individual decay 
					of a quantum particle appears random and can only be 
					predicted statistically by Quantum Mechanics, but that does 
					not mean that the decay happened due to some non-physical 
					cause. Randomness is an epistemological notion reflecting 
					limitations in our complete understanding of the underlying 
					reality, not a fundamental notion of physics. Secondly even 
					if the randomness was beyond physics, the free will due to 
					randomness will still be not determined by the brain/body of 
					the person exercizing the free will. The free in that case 
					may be free from physics, but not free from whatever is 
					causing the randomness. So either way the notion of free 
					will dissolves into meaninglessness, because the very notion 
					of free will implies the existence of an independent driving 
					force beyond physics that causes a human to make choices, 
					essentially equivalent to proposing a &quot;soul&quot; hypothesis and 
					the free will is then relegated to the soul of that person.

					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another implication 
					of the natural view of life is that morality or ethics are 
					also the result of the laws of physics and thus have no 
					intrinsic meaning. The &quot;should&quot;s or &quot;oughtta&quot;s are instincts 
					instilled into the brain by evolution, and thus by physics. 
					We often hear the cliches &quot;Morality is not subject to 
					scientific laws&quot;, as if morality is subject to some &quot;other&quot; 
					laws. This statement is vague in itself. But the simple fact 
					that morality is due to an instinct instilled by evolution 
					immediately makes it clear that the origin of moral 
					instincts is coded into the laws of physics. The causal 
					chain is : Physics--&gt;Evolution--&gt;Brain--&gt;Morality. And it is 
					evolution which instils a &quot;should&quot; in our mind. There is no 
					intrinsic criteria of morality outside and independent of 
					physics. Morality is the overall sense of right and wrong 
					instilled into the brain of human species through evolution. 
					There can be variation in that moral instinct in individual 
					humans within human species, but statistically the morality 
					among the species as a whole is such that it helps to 
					preserve the species. And morality also can change and adapt 
					due to evolutionary pressure. We often hear religious 
					believers justify belief in God by raising the question that 
					without a belief in God how can there be morality, and 
					wouldn't humans and society in general slide into immorality 
					and chaos? The fallacy in this argument is that morality 
					will be there, regardless of religious belief, as morality 
					is a product of evolution. In fact even religious belief 
					itself is one form of evolutionary strategy for survival. 
					Religious morality is rooted in the more fundamental 
					evolutionary instinct of morality, although the religious 
					believers have the illusion that their moral beliefs are due 
					to a belief in God's commandments. The moral instinct, being 
					a product of evolution, is present in theists and atheists 
					alike in varying degrees. The only thing belief in religion 
					adds is a set of ritualistic practices and behaviour 
					peculiar to a religion. There can be individual variations 
					of morality among humans, so there will be instances of 
					individuals with no sense of morality, or different from the 
					average. For many who do not believe in God (in the 
					traditional religious sense) and understand that there is no 
					objective basis of morality, they still feel a strong 
					inherent instinct against committing certain acts. They 
					cannot justify with absolute reason, why they should not 
					commit those acts, but nevertheless cannot commit those act 
					either. Even those who understand that their moral senses 
					are due to evolution, also feel the instinct of right and 
					wrong and act accordingly. It is a curious thing, but there 
					is no contradiction, in fact it is all self-consistent. 
					Again a stark reminder that each human is a system of 
					particles obeying laws of physics, irrespective of their 
					beliefs. Even if for some reasons all humans suddenly turned 
					into atheists, humans species (via the laws of physics) will 
					always find a way to enforce some standards of morality, 
					purely for evolutionary survival. Human species will not 
					allow itslef to self-destruct, physics does not admit of 
					that solution of it's equation, figuratively speaking.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A human is a very 
					special system of particles having a property called 
					consciousness capable of making a human appreciate that they 
					are a system of particles run by the laws of physics. Not 
					every human can realize this capabilty of appreciating this 
					fact however. </font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana">Philosophers of science have always 
					been intrigued by this so-called consciousness loop : </font>
					</p>
					<p><font face="Verdana">
					Physics--&gt;Evolution--&gt;Consciousness--&gt;(Discovery of) Physics
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is indeed 
					intriguing to realize that this circular chain is due to the 
					laws of physics (that human mind can discover laws of 
					physics is also rooted in physics!). It is all internally 
					self-consistent. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The same is true for 
					instincts of fear/anxiety. They are also hardwired by 
					evolution in the primitive part of the brain. Rationalism, 
					which is a byproduct of the evolution of human brain in the 
					cerebral cortex and has no causal effect on those instincts. 
					So one can be rational and but still have an instinct of 
					fear, like afraid of staying alone in a deserted house, just 
					as one can feel the instinct of morality without believing 
					in God or on any absolute criterian for morality. Fear of 
					the unknown is an evolutionary instinct. So is love, and in 
					fact all emotions. Passionate champions of humans rights can 
					refute religious beliefs and justify a secular approach to 
					morality and human rights, using such expressions as &quot;human 
					spirit is noble&quot; &quot;love is supreme&quot; etc. But at the end these 
					are appeal to emotions, not a cold, hard, logical positions. 
					All that matters is what evolution instills in the brain on 
					the average. Of course evolution itself creates this 
					necessary tension between two opposites. Tension is 
					essential to stability. This fact has been acknowledged by 
					scientists in the light of evolution and a detailed analysis 
					of mathematical modelling of the evolutionary mechanisms. We 
					know by this insight that if each member of human species 
					were completely honest or dishonest, or kind and generous, 
					or extremely violent or malicious that will not be 
					evolutionarily stable and will lead to self destruction of 
					human species. Evolution requires a stable and optimal 
					distribution of evil and good. This is a purely mechanical/ 
					natural consequence of physics. A simple example of that 
					would be the hypothetical situation where there is barely 
					enough food for one to survive and there are two starving 
					good people. They will both die rather than one eating the 
					food and letting the other die. Similarly a society with all 
					liars or all truthful will also lead to an evolutionary 
					instability. The most stable state is some liars but 
					majority truthful in varying degrees. The fact that most 
					people believe lying is wrong, and telling the truth is 
					right, is also a consequence of evolutionary mechanism to 
					create that stable state. Evolution will not allow all 
					humans to become philosophers or religious extremists 
					either. That stabilty requires a statistical variation is 
					one of the most profound insights of evolutionary science. 
					Evolution requires inequality for survival of some. If all 
					are equally strong, they will mutually destroy each other. 
					If all are weak, they also will eventually self-destruct 
					also. A distribution of the strong and the weak is a 
					necessary(evil) so that some may survive. This is the 
					hardest lessons of evolution to assimilate. This fact of 
					evolution, natural selection, was used by some in the past 
					to promote social inequality and eugenics (started with 
					Herbert Spencer in Victorian England). That was a fallacy of 
					promoting an &quot;is to an ought&quot; also known as naturalistic 
					fallacy. The fact is that what is in nature cannot be 
					justified as right or wrong. Nature will be whatever it will 
					be based on physics. The fact that such views of Darwinism 
					didn't hold up only points to the fact that evolution does 
					not favour eugenics, hence such views (called social 
					Darwinism) got weeded out by evolution itself. We have to 
					credit physics for the demise of social Darwinism, if we 
					have to. The lofty talk about triumph of humanity or human 
					spirit etc to explain that is just a metaphor of language.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Humanists can 
					passionately call for an utopian world of humans devoid of 
					any ill feeling, full of love for all. But such utopian 
					state of all ideal humans is not consistent with the laws of 
					evolution i.e physics. But the yearning and passionate 
					struggle to achieve that utopia is not. That urge is part of 
					evolution itself Also just like the instincts of morality 
					and fear, an appreciation that all such yearnings for 
					idealism is produced by evolutionary forces does not result 
					in a loss of that instinctual yearnings. That is the 
					paradox, if you will, of evolution/physics. An 
					understanding/discovery of the laws of physics cannot affect 
					or alter the laws of physics!. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One may get the 
					feeling that all this talk about life and human emotions 
					being nothing but the result of the laws of physics takes 
					away the mystique, the romanticism of human imagination. 
					Nothing is further from the truth. Alert reader may have 
					noticed no mention has been made as to the origin/evolution 
					of the laws of physics. With so much talk about the insights 
					into the natural root of life and its various aspects, the 
					fact remains that the origin of the laws of physics is not 
					known or is knowable. That is the ultimate mystery. It is 
					not knowable because the laws of physics are the only tool 
					humans have at their disposal (tested and beautiful) to seek 
					the truth about reality, the truth that can be shared among 
					humanity that is independent of one's belief, affiliation, 
					color, race etc. Obviously understanding the origin of the 
					laws of physics is not possible using physics as a tool. So 
					this very existence of an ultimate mystery will be a 
					permanent source of a sense of wonder and mystical feelings 
					among those who appreciate the beauty of the workings of the 
					laws of nature. The laws which not only give rise to the 
					fragrance of a flower, or the fascinating patterns of a 
					snowflake, but also the ethereal quality of love in humans. 
					The laws which create in the brain a sense of wonder at the 
					working of the laws, and creates a sense of wonder at the 
					creation of a sense of wonder at the working of the laws....
