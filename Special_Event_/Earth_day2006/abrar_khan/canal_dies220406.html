	</font><font face="Verdana">
	<p align="justify">As a student of architecture under Urban Designs course 
	we went to Begunbari canal in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, to do an assignment 
	titled ‘How Begun Bari Canal can be restored and how to make it a worth 
	mentioning part of the city?’ This work gave me surprising experiences.</p>
	<p align="justify">The total area of BBC (BegunBari Canal) is 237.7645 
	acres. Some of its portions are situated at ward no 37 and the rest is at 
	ward no 22 (near Rampura). This canal is surrounded by Gulshan, Rampura, 
	Madhubag, Mirbag, Tejgaon Industrial Area, Ulan, and Badda and by many other 
	important places of Dhaka city. Once upon a time in Dhaka, there were about 
	20 wetlands. The dead but famous Dholai canal was one of them and another is 
	BBC. Once BBC was connected with Dhanmondi Lake and Dhanmondi Lake was with 
	Turag River through Katashur canal. The other side of BBC was connected with 
	Balu River and still they are connected, though Balu River is going to be 
	demolished. Balu River is now being filled up day by day and the plots of 
	Bashundhara, one of the largest real estate company of the country, are 
	rising over there. How can it be possible to grab a river by a business 
	company? But such abhorring things are happening.</p>
	<p align="justify">Then what is the role of the Government? Bashundhara is 
	not a recent company. For many years, these occupation and exploitation are 
	going on. So it can be said that every government is pretending to be 
	innocent in this matter.</p>
	<p align="justify">Now let us look at BBC. In many places it has already 
	been occupied. For example, one of Eastern Housing’s, another big real 
	estate company, project is Mahanager housing and it had been established 
	through 8 to 10 years (known from local people). Most of its area is 
	situated over BBC. During our survey in 2005, we found out that the land of 
	the housing project has extended more than the information given by the Land 
	Survey Department, 2004.</p>
	<p align="justify">And it is surprising that even the Gulshan Arong, an 
	enterprise of BRAC the largest NGO, and the plot of BRAC University are also 
	situated over this canal. Another worth mentioning illegal establishment is 
	Kunipara, situated on the edge of BBC. It is a part of TIA (Tejgaon 
	Industrial Area). All the dwellers of this place are industrial and garment 
	workers. The entire dwelling place is hanging over the canal, where majority 
	of the workers are living. The rent of each room of these houses is about 
	TK/-500 to TK/-1500 and the area of each room is hardly 100 square feet. 
	There is no kitchen and sanitary latrine. All the time an unhealthy and 
	malodors atmosphere ruling in this place. It is very sad to say that these 
	suffered people are playing a great role in our economy. During the flood 
	the entire para becomes inundated. Day by day BBC is getting polluted by 
	garments, industrial and human waste materials.</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<img style="WIDTH: 350px; HEIGHT: 260px" alt="" hspace="0" src="http://www.meghbarta.org/nws/admin/nw_view_pic.php?id=26" align="right" border="0">Does 
	our government care or think even once, why there is environmental 
	disasters, why there is no timely rainfall, why the rivers are being 
	fishless, why the northern part of the country are becoming desert, why 
	monkeys are not seen in the jungle in Madhupur? Actually ADB (Asian 
	Development Bank) helped to destroy the Madhupur forest. ADB planted those 
	trees which were not relevant to that forest and the environment, and it 
	destroyed our environmental balance. These are, in fact, bear no importance 
	to the government. </p>
	<p align="justify">In monsoon, even for a little rain Dhaka city suffers 
	great water congestion. In fact the present filled up body of the most of 
	the wetlands is one of the main causes for water congestion. Our total 
	hydroecology is at stake due to illegal occupation. And we all know that 
	rainwater is the main source of under earth water reservoir, but day by day 
	we become waterless because of illegal and unplanned earth filing.</p>
	<p align="justify">Under the present situation though unuttered but most 
	appropriate slogan is “Esho khal bhori”. All these are going in the name of 
	so-called development. These cannot be a development these are the way to 
	make Dhaka a dead city. </p>
	<p align="justify">Cities also need breathing and fooding. There should be 
	25% forest in a country. But Bangladesh consists only 6%. Thus it seems our 
	land will no longer chock with the enhancing destruction. </p>
	<p align="justify">Now let me tell about the ghost story of the TIA. Most of 
	the industries are closed there; gathering of drug-addicted people can be 
	seen here and there. Many lands are left here vacant which cost more than 
	crore, whereas there exists artificial land crisis. Really a chaotic 
	situation! Local people have said that the control of those lands changes 
	with the changes of ruling power. </p>
	<p align="justify">Informed by one of the engineers of PWD, that some 
	industries are closed, some are under legal proceedings and the rest are 
	suffering illicit garment business (the accurate number is concealed for 
	security).</p>
	<p align="justify">Tejgaon Industrial Area was designed in Pakistan Period. 
	But for some unknown reason no residence was designed for laborers. It might 
	be possible that ample space was vacant that time. And today we are watching 
	its terrible consequence, i.e.,”Kunipara”, an illicit establishment over 
	BegunBari Canal, though are indispensable, indelible. In subsequent period, 
	those helpless laborers and the TIA are almost ignored by Governments.</p>
	<p align="justify">In 2005, to save this canal our landscape Professor Tania 
	Karim and her organization UW2SD arranged a seminar. Not only we, the 
	students, but also our teachers and some architects had attended that 
	seminar. Many well-known persons of RAJUK, Dhaka City Corporation and of 
	many other governmental organizations were present there. Among them there 
	were also some renowned environmentalists. Dr. Ainoon Nishat of IUCN 
	(International Union of Conservation of Nature) is worth mentioning. 
	Architect Sirajul Islam of DDC demonstrated the present situation and the 
	future plan about BBC by a slide show. Though this was signed by the Prime 
	minister on 5 April 2003, but yet to implement. </p>
	<p align="justify">However, in November 2005 occupancy started again in BBC 
	in the name of beautification of Dhaka for SAARC Summit with the help of DCC. 
	When savior is the destroyer then what will people do? But in that seminar 
	many of our teachers proposed some solutions of this grave problem very 
	dexterously. Whether those will be approved or not, no body knows. </p>
	<p align="justify">To recapitulate, despite this alarming situation and 
	giving such cogent and useful solutions, government does not even bother to 
	give a little effort for BBC. The restoration of this canal is very 
	essential and inevitable for the citizen of Dhaka as well as the whole 
	country. So, this is the high time to unite those people, who are yearning 
	to save their souls by saving BegunBari Canal, and also to force the 
	disinterested government for taking proper steps to make BegunBari Canal a 
	dependable friend for our environment.</p>
	<p align="justify">How terribly people are passing their days, who are 
	actually running the garments and industries in Dhaka. And the Canal’s story 
	is beyond description, its death is very near.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
