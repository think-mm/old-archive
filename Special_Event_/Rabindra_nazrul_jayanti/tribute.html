<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">25th Baishakh, 1409 Bangla year :&nbsp; the <b>141st birth anniversary of 
Rabindranath Thakur</b>, the foremost icon of Bengali literature and culture who 
single-handedly transformed our beloved Bengali language into its today’s modern 
and mature form by virtue of his extraordinary creative genius. A true 
internationalist in spirit and a firm believer of universal humanism, he toiled 
hard to promote and propagate the Bengali language and literature in the world 
stage which eventually led to his winning of the Nobel prize for literature in 
1913. Much has been written about his unfathomable contribution to Bengali 
literature but not enough light has been shed on many other remarkable features 
of the beautiful mind of this myriad-minded man. One such less talked about side 
of this towering personality was his social and political consciousness, which 
we will try to address here briefly in our today’s birthday tribute to him.

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">- <b>He wholeheartedly believed in the unity 
of the Hindu and Muslim communities</b> and often publicly took stand in favour of 
the then downtrodden Muslim community. He actively took part in the movement 
against the partition of Bengal in 1905 and composed the theme song of that 
historical movement, ‘Banglar maaTi, Banglar jal’. He was also the initiator of 
the symbolic ritual of ‘raakhibandhan’ between the members of the two 
communities. But then he had the moral courage to denounce and discard this 
apparently noble movement, for it’s increasingly communal nature and oppressive 
role on the poor Muslim traders and farmers, as depicted in his ‘ghare baaire’ 
novel, later filmed by Satyajit Ray. In his later life he also vehemently 
protested against the proposal of making ‘Bande Mataram’ the national anthem of 
India, for it’s communal overtone and for being potentially offensive to the 
Muslim community of India. </font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">-&nbsp; <b>He was not an adherent of the narrow 
nationalist ideology and opposed it all</b> along, both in national and 
international arena, for the fear of it’s potential danger of becoming divisive 
and chauvinistic, which we are all witnessing now in dismay through out South 
Asia and in other corners of the world. A man of conscience, he was at the same 
time very critical of the oppressive imperialist regime of the British India. We 
are all aware of his disowning the knighthood for the atrocities committed by 
the British soldiers on the innocent population of Jalianwalaabag and the 
accompanying scathing diatribe against the British government. He also wrote 
another passionate letter in the newspaper from the sickbed just two months 
before his death denouncing the British ruler in no uncertain terms for it’s 
shamelessly self-serving and hypocritical role in India.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">- <b>As a socially conscious person he was 
very much aware of the cruel oppression and discrimination against the Indian 
women in the name of culture, tradition and religion.</b> He openly sympathized with 
the victimized women, strongly denounced all those oppressive social norms and 
practices and preached for the equal rights for the Indian women in many of his 
writings, such as ‘streer patra’, ‘chitrangadaa’, ‘jogajog’ etc to name a few. 
His sympathy for the women wasn’t confined to words only; he made conscious 
efforts to translate that into action. One such glorious example is arranging 
marriage of his own son Rathindranath Thakur to a child-widow Pratima Debee.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">These three arbitrarily selected 
characteristics of Rabindranath are only a few among many of his other socially 
conscious and committed outlooks. We all should strive to know more about this 
exceptionally open-minded, truly modern and progressive personality and 
implement his humanist teachings in our personal and social lives.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That will be the greatest tribute to our 
beloved poet Rabindranath, who has provided us with both our national identity 
as Bangali and the national anthem, ‘aamaar sonaar bangla, aami tomaay 
bhaalobaasi.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
