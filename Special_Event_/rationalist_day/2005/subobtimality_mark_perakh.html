	<h2 align="center"><font color="#800080">Why irreducible complexity does not 
	imply intelligent design</font></h2>
	<h3 align="center"><font size="5">
	<a href="../../../Articles/mark_perakh/index.html">Mark Perakh</a></font></h3>
	<p align="justify">Michael Behe's book <i>Darwin's Black Box</i> is one of 
	the most popular and extensively reviewed books promoting intelligent design 
	&quot;theory.&quot; The concept of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; propagandized in that book 
	has been touted by Behe and other intelligent design advocates as a great 
	discovery and used as one of the main tools in their efforts to &quot;destroy 
	Darwinism&quot; (the goal openly announced by such &quot;leading lights&quot; of 
	intelligent design as Phillip Johnson [1991] and Jonathan Wells [2002]). </p>
	<p align="justify">Irreducible complexity, according to &quot;design theorists,&quot; 
	implies intelligent design of biological system. In fact, such a conclusion 
	lacks a logical foundation. Irreducible complexity even can more reasonably 
	be construed as an argument against intelligent design.</p>
	<p align="justify">Michael Behe's concept of irreducible complexity (IC) (Behe 
	1996) has been critically discussed by experts in biology &nbsp;--&nbsp;see, for 
	example, publications by H. Allen Orr (1997), Russell F. Doolittle (1997), 
	David Ussery (1999, 2004), Kenneth R. Miller (1999), Gert Korthof (1999), 
	Matt Inlay (2002), Pete Dunkelberg (2003), and others. The attitude of many 
	professional biologists to Behe's IC concept has even found its most 
	uncompromising expression in Kenneth Miller's words: &quot;... the notion of 
	irreducible complexity is nonsense.&quot; (1999, p. 150).</p>
	<p align="justify">While the critical analysis of the IC concept by 
	professional biologists seems to be sufficient to dismiss Behe's alleged 
	great discovery in biology, there is another aspect to IC which, to my mind, 
	makes the very notion of &quot;IC implies intelligent design (ID)&quot; implausible.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">A concept identical in all but name to Behe's irreducible 
	complexity was around for a long time before Behe. It was applied to the 
	problems of evolution of various anatomical structures, such as the 
	mammalian eye (recall the many times answered question, &quot;what good is half 
	an eye?&quot;), or the snakes' apparatus of venom injection (Marcell 1976), etc.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">Even more relevant, a practically identical concept 
	(&quot;interlocking complexity&quot;) was discussed from the standpoint of genetics 
	already nearly 80 years earlier (Muller 1918, 1939). Even the application of 
	the IC concept to the molecular assemblies within a biological cell (which 
	is Behe's playing field) was put into circulation some ten years before Behe 
	(Cairns-Smith 1986). Unlike Behe and his supporters, these Behe's 
	predecessors did not claim that the concept in question constitutes a great 
	discovery or implies intelligent design, so in the rendition of these 
	predecessors it would hardly invoke Miller's categorical rejection quoted 
	above.</p>
	<p align="justify">The critical discussion of Behe's ideas has mainly 
	concentrated on three aspects of IC, to wit:</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p align="justify">The first aspect of IC subjected to discussion has 
		been about the very definition of IC. To my knowledge, Behe himself has 
		never acknowledged that his definition was in any way imperfect. 
		However, Behe's colleague William Dembski (viewed by the ID advocates as 
		their leading logician) admitted that Behe's idea of IC was &quot;neither 
		exactly correct nor wrong&quot; (Dembski 2002, p. 280). 
		</li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify">The second aspect of IC subjected to critique was the 
		question of whether molecular systems offered by Behe as examples of IC 
		are indeed IC. A number of biologists pointed out that systems such as 
		bacterial cilia or blood-clotting cascade which, according to Behe, 
		exemplify IC, are in fact reducible without losing their &quot;basic 
		function.&quot; (See, for example, Miller 1999). 
		</li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify">The third aspect of IC subjected to critique is the 
		most important. Behe asserts that IC systems (exemplified by the protein 
		assemblies in biological cells) cannot have evolved via a direct 
		&quot;Darwinian&quot; path because such a path necessarily goes through a sequence 
		of intermediates each performing the same &quot;basic&quot; function. Since any 
		system comprising fewer parts than the IC system in question is, by 
		definition of IC, dysfunctional, it could not be an evolutionary 
		precursor of an IC system, or so says Behe.&nbsp; Regarding evolution of IC 
		system via an <i>indirect</i> evolutionary path, Behe admits that such a 
		process is possible but, in his opinion, so highly improbable that it 
		cannot be considered a feasible option. </li>
	</ol>
	<p align="justify">The last point has been disputed by professional 
	biologists. They suggested detailed scenarios showing how, for example, a 
	bacterial flagellum could have evolved from evolutionary precursors with a 
	sufficiently high likelihood (Matzke 2003, Ussery 2004, Musgrave 2004).</p>
	<p align="justify">The consensus of the majority of professional biologists 
	seems to favor the views of Behe's opponents.&nbsp; Except for vague 
	protestations wherein Behe and his supporters demand from their opponents 
	highly detailed proofs of the factual occurrence of indirect evolutionary 
	paths leading to IC systems, Behe seems to be unable to offer substantive 
	counter-arguments.</p>
	<p align="justify">In this essay I will analyze the IC concept from a 
	viewpoint different from the three aspects of the problem listed above. I 
	intend to show that even if the IC concept is valid, and even if many 
	biological systems are indeed IC, this in itself does not logically lead to 
	design inference. <i>My contention is that IC in itself can more reasonably 
	be construed as an argument against design inference. </i></p>
	<p align="justify">In an essay titled &quot;Irreducible Contradiction&quot; posted to 
	the internet in 1999 (see <a href="#cont">reference</a>) I suggested 
	critical comments to Behe's <i>Darwin's Black Box</i>. This essay was 
	translated and printed in Russia (Perakh 2001a) and in Israel (Perakh 
	2001b). &nbsp;After its appearance in Russian in <i>Kontinent </i>the essay was 
	reproduced on several Russian websites and invoked a discussion which 
	sporadically continues even now (February 2005). By the end of 2003 my book
	<i>Unintelligent Design</i> was published wherein chapter 2 was essentially 
	a slightly modified version of the same essay (Perakh 2004). &nbsp;Recently that 
	chapter was translated into Polish and appeared in the Polish journal <i>
	Filozoficzne Aspekty Genezy</i> (Philosophical Aspects of Origin) -- see
	<a href="http://www.nauka-a-religia.uz.zgora.pl/index.php?action=tekst&id=45">
	http://www.nauka-a-religia.uz.zgora.pl/index.php?action=tekst&amp;id=45</a> .</p>
	<p align="justify">In the nearly six years since the appearance on the 
	internet of the essay in question, Michael Behe has never uttered a word 
	acknowledging the existence of my critical remarks.&nbsp; Nor has William 
	Dembski, who has actively promoted Behe's irreducible complexity concept, 
	ever mentioned my critical comments. Neither did anybody else from the 
	intelligent design camp. </p>
	<p align="justify">Recently Dembski posted an article titled &quot;Irreducible 
	Complexity Revisited,&quot; (Dembski 2005) which has initiated some discussion 
	(RBH 2005, Perakh 2005). An article by Behe appeared recently in <i>New York 
	Times,</i> wherein Behe repeats again the same much critiqued notions 
	without having changed his position or having accounted for a single point 
	suggested by his critics. I think therefore it is worthwhile to revisit 
	certain points which seem to be in need of clarification, regarding the IC 
	concept and <i>its alleged logical segueing into ID</i>. </p>
	<p align="justify">I'll not discuss here Dembski's recent modifications of 
	the IC definition (addressed in Perakh 2005 and RBH 2005).&nbsp; Instead, I will 
	refer to Behe's original definition of IC, which, albeit suffering from 
	certain deficiencies (as admitted by Dembski 2002), does essentially reflect 
	his principal idea.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">The essence of Behe's original IC concept is as 
		follows:</p>
		<p align="justify">A system is IC if:</p>
		<p align="justify">(a) It consists of several parts. </p>
		<p align="justify">(b) The parts are &quot;well matched.&quot; (Behe offered no 
		definition of the notion of being &quot;well-matched.&quot;) </p>
		<p align="justify">(c) It performs a certain &quot;basic&quot; function (for 
		example, clots blood); </p>
		<p align="justify">(d) It ceases to function if even a single part is 
		missing. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify">Having discussed several examples of protein &quot;machines&quot; 
	in biological cells, which, according to Behe, are IC, Behe then asserts 
	that the existence of IC systems in a biological cell points to them being 
	designed rather than having emerged as a result of evolution. I intend to 
	show that Behe's assertion contradicts logic. </p>
	<p align="justify">Note that Behe's concept of IC comprises two components: 
	one is <i>complexity</i> and the other is <i>irreducibility</i>.</p>
	<p align="justify">Behe expends a lot of effort to demonstrate how 
	staggeringly complex the protein systems in a cell are.&nbsp; It is evident that 
	for Behe the complexity in question is part of his idea, pointing to design 
	as the alternative to evolution. According to Behe, biological systems must 
	have been designed because they (A) are very complex; and (B) cannot 
	function unless all of their parts are present. </p>
	<p align="justify">Regarding (A) -- complexity -- note that Behe has not 
	provided a definition of complexity. Several such definitions have been 
	suggested, though, by Dembski. </p>
	<p align="justify">As has been pointed out before (Perakh 2004), Dembski's 
	various definitions of complexity are often incompatible with each other.&nbsp; 
	There is among them, though, a definition repeated by Dembski many times, 
	which is in tune with Behe's point (A). According to that definition 
	complexity is equivalent to small probability (Dembski 1998). For example, 
	Dembski asserts in his book that &quot;probability measures are disguised 
	complexity measures&quot; (page 114). Variations of this assertion are scattered 
	over Dembski's books. Thus the more complex a system, the less probable its 
	spontaneous emergence as a result of chance, or so says Dembski. So, 
	according to Behe and Dembski, the more complex a system, the more likely it 
	was designed -- this is the essence of point (A) in Behe's concept. 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p align="justify">Point (B) -- irreducibility -- in Behe's concept asserts 
	that an IC system loses its function if even a single part is missing.&nbsp; </p>
	<p align="justify">According to Behe, protein &quot;machines&quot; in a cell meet both 
	requirements for being IC -- they are very complex and they are 
	irreducible.&nbsp; </p>
	<p align="justify">My goal now is to discuss: what if this assertion is 
	true? Does it lead logically to the design inference? &nbsp;Behe's answer to this 
	question is &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
	<p align="justify">I submit that Behe's answer is illogical. Here is why.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">Start with complexity. </p>
	<p align="justify">As I have argued before (Perakh 2004), contrary to 
	Dembski's persistent assertions, complexity is certainly not just disguised 
	improbability. Examples to the contrary abound. Imagine a pile of stones. 
	Each stone has some irregular shape that resulted from a series of chance 
	events. Among these irregularly shaped stones we find a perfectly 
	rectangular brick.&nbsp; It has a simple shape which can be described by a short 
	(i.e. simple) program containing only three numbers -- width, length, and 
	height. On the other hand each of the irregularly shaped stones can be 
	described only by a more complex program containing many numbers.&nbsp; However, 
	the probability of a rectangular brick being a result of chance is low: the 
	brick is reasonably (with a high probability) assumed to be a product of 
	design. For irregularly shaped stones the opposite is true -- the 
	probability of their origin in chance is larger than in design. Here the 
	relationship between probability and complexity is opposite that prescribed 
	by Dembski's definition (but compatible with the definition of Kolmogorov 
	complexity -- see, for example, Chaitin 2003). </p>
	<p align="justify">In this example simplicity rather than complexity is a 
	marker of design. I submit that the described example shows not only that 
	Dembski's definition of complexity fails for certain situations but also 
	that, generally, a more reasonable statement is that simplicity points to 
	design while complexity <i>as such</i> points to chance (more about this in 
	Perakh 2004). </p>
	<p align="justify">If this is so, then the first part of Behe's IC concept 
	-- complexity - is more reasonably construed as an indication of &quot;blind&quot; 
	evolution rather than of design. </p>
	<p align="justify">Now turn to the second part of Behe's IC -- 
	irreducibility. Recall that Behe's idea is that losing a single part of a 
	protein &quot;machine&quot; makes it non-operational. Therefore, says Behe, such a 
	&quot;machine&quot; could not have evolved via a &quot;Darwinian&quot; evolutionary process 
	which requires the existence of functional precursors. </p>
	<p align="justify">The simple fact is, though, that if an IC system has been 
	designed, we have a case of a <i>bad design</i>. &nbsp;If the loss of a single 
	part destroys the system's function, such a system is unreliable and 
	therefore, if it is designed, the designer is inept. When engineers design 
	machines, bridges, skyscrapers, TV sets, or artificial kidneys, they always 
	try to envision what can go wrong with their design and how to ensure that 
	small defects do not result in a failure of their product; to this end they 
	build in certain redundancies so that in case some part of the construction 
	fails, its function will not be completely lost but rather taken over by 
	certain self-compensatory features. </p>
	<p align="justify">IC systems, by definition, are highly vulnerable to 
	accidental damage.</p>
	<p align="justify"><i>IC systems, if they are designed, are poorly designed.</i></p>
	<p align="justify">It must be stressed that in this case we go beyond the 
	problem of suboptimal design. When we deal just with suboptimal design as 
	such, the ID advocates suggest various arguments supposedly justifying the 
	reasons for design being not optimal. For example, one such argument is that 
	we simply don't know anything about the designer's reasons to behave as he 
	does; hence our notion is just an argument from ignorance; perhaps whatever 
	from human limited standpoint looks like suboptimal design has good reasons 
	beyond our comprehension to be as it is, etc.&nbsp; Such an argument usually 
	(albeit not always explicitly) presumes that suboptimality is a &quot;side 
	effect&quot; rather than a deliberately chosen goal of the designer. </p>
	<p align="justify">Whether such arguments are convincing depends on the 
	mindset of the particular persons.&nbsp; For this discourse, however, such an 
	argument is not really relevant. Indeed, Behe's concept contains as a 
	crucial part the assumption that the irreducibility of biological system is 
	a marker of design.&nbsp; Such an assumption is obviously not about a designer 
	who has failed to provide an optimal solution or compromised in his design 
	for some unknown reason. It is no longer about some &quot;side effect&quot; which the 
	designer has simply failed to correct or has kept for unknown reasons, 
	extraneous to the design's purpose. &nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">Behe's concept assumes that the <i>very feature</i> which 
	makes the design bad means the system has been designed. In other words, 
	Behe's concept means that suboptimality is&nbsp; viewed not as just an 
	unfortunate oversight by the designer; nor is it viewed as something that, 
	albeit seemingly detrimental for the designed entity, has some reasons known 
	only to the designer but unfathomable to us. No, in Behe's concept the <i>
	very suboptimality is suggested as a marker of design</i>: an IC system by 
	definition is easily destroyed by damaging just a single part, so a system's 
	being IC means that its vulnerability is its ineliminable feature.&nbsp; Behe's 
	idea implies that the system is IC (and hence suboptimal) <i>because such 
	was the goal of the designer. </i>&nbsp;&quot;The system is suboptimal, <i>therefore</i> 
	it is a product of design&quot; -- that is what Behe's concept entails. </p>
	<p align="justify">ID advocates are welcome to accuse me of offering a 
	caricature of their idea, but it cannot be helped when a concept's essence 
	sounds like a caricature or a parody; the idea that &quot;<i>IC implies ID&quot;</i> 
	can most succinctly be rendered by a maxim: <i>stupid, therefore designed</i>.</p>
	<p align="justify">If this is a satisfying logic, I don't know what a lack 
	of logic is. </p>
	<p align="justify">Remember also that Behe's design inference is based not 
	on some positive evidence but rather on a negative assertion:&nbsp; IC systems 
	could not have evolved via a &quot;Darwinian&quot; path. Since such a path is 
	impossible, concludes Behe, the only remaining option is design. </p>
	<p align="justify">This is an argument of the &quot;either-or&quot; type.&nbsp; I will not 
	discuss here whether or not there indeed are only two mutually-exclusive 
	options. My point is different: if Behe infers design only because the 
	direct evolutionary path, in his view, is impossible and an <i>indirect</i> 
	evolutionary path is <i>improbable</i>, then, to be consistent, he should 
	use the same probabilistic criteria for judging whether or not it is 
	reasonable to assume that the feature which makes design bad is a marker of 
	design.&nbsp; How probable is it that the putative designer deliberately designs 
	his products to be IC if this means the product will be unreliable? </p>
	<p align="justify">Dembski asserts that ID does not imply a <i>smart</i> 
	designer (Dembski 2001). Designer can even be stupid, says Dembski. 
	&nbsp;However, from many other utterances of ID advocates, including Dembski, it 
	is clear that all such statements are just a smoke screen and in fact they 
	believe that their &quot;designer&quot; is the God of the Bible. (See, for example, 
	Dembski 1999, part 3, or Johnson 2000.) This designer is supposed to be 
	omnipotent and omni-benevolent. </p>
	<p align="justify">In fact, ID advocates want to have their cake and to eat 
	it too. On the one hand they concede that the putative designer may even be 
	stupid -- this they say when trying to explain suboptimality of design. &nbsp;On 
	the other hand they speak about Christian values, cultural war, the Logos of 
	John's gospel and the imminent triumph of ID over &quot;materialistic&quot; science. 
	(Dembski 1999, part 3; Johnson 2000). It is not by accident that the leading 
	young earth creationist, Henry Morris, who is more consistent in his frank 
	biblical literalism, referred to Dembski's contortions regarding the nature 
	of the designer as &quot;nonsense.&quot; (Morris 2005).</p>
	<p align="justify">How probable is that the very features that make design 
	bad are markers of design (as follows from Behe's discourse)? It is hardly 
	less improbable than the evolution of protein assemblies via indirect 
	&quot;Darwinian&quot; paths. </p>
	<p align="justify">If Behe infers design just because evolution of protein 
	assemblies via indirect &quot;Darwinian&quot; paths looks improbable to him, design 
	inference also has to be excluded because of the improbability of the 
	putative designer's deliberately incorporating in the protein assemblies the 
	very features (like IC) which make the design bad. </p>
	<p align="justify">The above discourse is, to my mind, sufficient to reject 
	the design inference based on the IC concept, as logically untenable. </p>
