	<span lang="EN-US">Time passes by rather swiftly.&nbsp; Before I could think

	Rather than writing an essay giving an encomium to rational thinking, let me 
	sidestep here from intellectual world and visit the boring and mundane world 
	to borrow some examples from real life to show how apparently rational 
	Bangalees make about turn to become irrational as they approach their golden

	<span lang="EN-US">By profession, I am a researcher in life sciences.&nbsp; 
	Everyday at work I am confronted with scientific questions dealing with my 
	research.&nbsp; I have to be a rationalist to answer those questions.&nbsp; Science 
	and mathematics are the most rational disciplines in the entire world.&nbsp; 
	There is no room for irrational behavior once someone wants to wet their 
	hand in science and mathematics.&nbsp; I try to bring my rational mind when I 
	enter my house after day’s work.&nbsp; However, it saddens me to see many 
	scientists and academicians in America who are born and brought up in South 
	Asia behave very differently when they return to their pad.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">The highly educated people are very “successful” when it 
	comes to their profession.&nbsp; They have attended publicly funded education 
	center back home studying math and sciences on top of other arts subject.&nbsp; 
	They came to the West for higher studies; after finishing theirs advanced 
	degrees many of them stayed here in search of greener pasture but once they 
	are safe and secure in their profession, many of them show irrational 
	behavior in their advancing years.</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;I am not making this up at all.&nbsp; I came to New Orleans 
	in 1985 after spending nearly 16 years in three universities in America.&nbsp; My 
	acquaintances in academia tended to be very rational.&nbsp; Many of our country 
	folks who I met in academia portrayed themselves to me as secularist with 
	rational mind.&nbsp; However, once they become older they shed their secular skin 
	and in its place, they wear a very parochial skin and show some very bizarre 
	and irrational behavior.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">One such person had received his doctoral degree in 
	chemistry from a university in Connecticut.&nbsp; He went back to Dhaka to marry 
	a young woman who was attending the Dhaka University.&nbsp; He showed his secular 
	demeanor to his new wife and in-laws and then returned to America with the 
	new bride.&nbsp; Within a few years, he began to change.&nbsp; In the meantime, he 
	became father of two kids.&nbsp; After 7-8 years of his marriage, he divorced his 
	wife and began to lead a secluded life.&nbsp; When he called me after a long 
	time, I heard a very different voice – an Islamic voice.&nbsp; Few years have 
	gone by since he contacted me over the phone and one day in 2000, I received 
	a call from my old acquaintance.&nbsp; He was visiting New Orleans with his “new 
	wife” and he wanted to meet me.&nbsp; When I saw him after 15 years, I could not 
	believe my eyes.&nbsp; My old acquaintance had become a <i>pucca</i> Muslim.&nbsp; He 
	flaunted a full beard and his diction was full with Islamic words and 
	lingo.&nbsp; He then called his wife to meet me.&nbsp; I saw a hijab-clad woman 
	entering the woman who seemed to be much unsophisticated.&nbsp; Later, he 
	confided with me that he really liked his newly found Islamic wife even 
	though she is not much of a companion as compared to his divorced wife who 
	had more charm and glamour.&nbsp; I think my acquaintance’s swift metamorphosis 
	from a rational to irrational world created so many problems for his first 
	wife that she thought it was not worth the while to live with him.&nbsp; My old 
	acquaintance became very philosophical with me when I met him.&nbsp; He said that 
	his conversion to fundamentalism brought him peace.&nbsp; He did not mind however 
	leading a life full with contradictions.&nbsp; I wanted to ask my old 
	acquaintance whether the principle of thermodynamics, which he studied in 
	his college days with so much fervor is dead now.&nbsp; But I bit my tongue and 
	let it come to pass.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">Let me narrate here the tale of another person who 
	happened to be my college roommate.&nbsp; This guy now lives in a town in Ohio.&nbsp; 
	He very badly wanted to come to the US for an advanced degree.&nbsp; I arranged a 
	scholarship for him when I was in the US in 1969.&nbsp; My roommate came in 
	September 1970 and stayed with my till August 1974.&nbsp; He was as secular as 
	anyone could be during 1970 through 1974.&nbsp; He was very much influenced by my 
	thoughts.&nbsp; However, during 1975 through 1990 as he grew older he began to 
	change.&nbsp; He slowly gave up his rational mind and then he took the plunge 
	into the world of irrationalism.&nbsp; He became one of the big shot in the 
	Mosque committee in the city where he lives.&nbsp; His daughter who was born in 
	America took hijab when she turned 15 or 16.&nbsp; He gave up freethinking and 
	became an avid Islamist.&nbsp; He used to talk to me about Darwinian world in his 
	secular days but now only think he talks about this temporal world, kids, 
	health, stock market, and other mundane things.&nbsp; Idealism is long gone from 
	his mind and he became a very materialistic person.&nbsp; Now religion plays a 
	very important role in his life.&nbsp; But my old roommate is beset with many 
	worldly problems.&nbsp; His son did not do very well in college and he suffered 
	due to car accidents.&nbsp; There is no room for creativity in his life and he 
	now dwells in a world plagued with irrationality.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">I could site many more examples drawn from the real world 
	to hit home a message.&nbsp; I have seen the folks who made that switch from 
	rational to irrational life; their world became topsy-turvy when they faced 
	some kind of hardship that is so common we all faced in our life.&nbsp; If an 
	accident happens in life, they say they must have sinned or else why should 
	Allah punish them this way.&nbsp; My friend did not do a hell of a job as a 
	parent to bring discipline in the life of his son.&nbsp; But he won’t admit 
	this.&nbsp; Religion is the only thing that is left for this guy.&nbsp; He is now 
	thinking about his life in the next world.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">Irrationality has plagued my roommate’s mind.&nbsp; Religion 
	is the only thing that he could think of.&nbsp; He grew up in a village amidst 
	people who knew nothing about freethinking and rationality.&nbsp; My roommate 
	became a quasi-secularist living in a room with a person who would tell him 
	all about evolution, physical laws, and a rational world. &nbsp;Nevertheless, I 
	suppose the vivid memory of childhood that is plagued with mumbo-jumbos of 
	Islamic tales and folklore was too much for him.&nbsp; My old roommate has now 
	become a born-again Muslim who could only think about his life in a heaven 
	up high in the firmament.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">Living in Cincinnati, Ohio, during 1972 through 1974, I 
	met a couple from Dhaka both of whom had doctoral degree in biochemistry 
	from England.&nbsp; They were young, energetic, and religion did not play any 
	role in their everyday life then.&nbsp; I met them in 1987 after 13 long years 
	when they were in their late forties.&nbsp; They also became very religious all 
	of a sudden.&nbsp; Four-five years ago, they went to Mecca for performing hajj 
	and after their return from the blessed land, the man wrote me an e-mail 
	saying all the good thing about performing hajj.&nbsp; They also became 
	born-again Muslim.&nbsp; The knowledge they have earned when they were young did 
	not make them any more rational.&nbsp; They are at peace living in their 
	irrational world.&nbsp; What a pity!&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">The case history I described above was from real life.&nbsp; 
	All the four persons had earned doctoral degrees; nevertheless, they decided 
	to abandon their rational life opting for a dark and dingy irrational life 
	that is beset with weird tales from 1400 years ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">Sometimes I think that these folks have acquired 
	knowledge and skills only to secure jobs to feed their stomach.&nbsp; They never 
	internalized the knowledge and applied them in their personal life.&nbsp; Thus, 
	it was very easy for them to revert to their irrational life.&nbsp; The 
	contradiction between rational and irrational life did not bother them a 
	bit.&nbsp; They are absorbed in their pleasant thoughts to lead an infinite life 
	in another world after death.&nbsp; Who is going to show them the path to 
	enlightenment?&nbsp; The people who once were intelligent and prone to learning 
	are what I call living dead.&nbsp; With a profound sadness in my heart let me 
	bring a closure to this elegiac piece.&nbsp; Have a happy ‘Rationalist Day.’&nbsp; 
	People from all walks of life should rise up and learn a thing or two to 
	become more rational at a time when religiosity has gotten the upper hand in 
	South Asia and other parts of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
