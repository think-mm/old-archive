  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In my earlier essay [<a href="../rationalism_aparthib.html">Rationalism 
	- It's Meaning and Implications</a>] on the occasion of last year's 
	rationalist day I attempted a definition and explanation of rationalism. I 
	wish to continue on further elaboration and clarification of rationalism, 
	particularly the relationship of rationalism with idealism and personal 
	faith. As I mentioned earlier that rationalism as a philosophy inevitably 
	leads to scientific method, because scientific method is based on logic and 
	evidence, two necessary element of rationalism. Scientific method (Or simply 
	Science) is nothing but applied rationalism. Consequently any idea or view 
	that contradicts science or logic cannot be consistent with rationalism. 
	Having said that I must emphasize that any personal faith or ideology which 
	is not supported by logic and evidence but which nevertheless does not 
	necessarily contradict logic or evidence cannot be considered inconsistent 
	with rationalism. It is important to understand fully the implications of 
	the previous statement. Rationalism does not disallow personal beliefs and 
	ideologies that are not supported by logic or evidence. Its just that those 
	beliefs and ideologies cannot be considered to be necessary elements of 
	rationalism. For example belief in the existence of alien life is neither 
	supported by logic nor evidence but does not contradict logic or evidence 
	either. Thus scientists can be divided in two camps on the belief in alien 
	life with neither camp violating rationalism. It is not against rationalism 
	to hold a personal belief unsupported by logic or evidence (but not 
	contradicting it). What is against rationalism is to assert such belief as a 
	true statement (proposition in the jargon of logic). In other words a 
	rationalist can hold a personal belief but allowing for the possibility of 
	his/her being wrong, thus refraining from asserting the belief as a 
	proposition (Again to it must be reemphasized that a rationalist belief 
	should not contradict logic or evidence). That is what distinguishes a 
	rationalists' belief from that of a dogmatist. A dogmatist asserts his/her 
	belief as absolute truth. As a trivial example, one can be rationalist and 
	for some reason believe that he/she will die at age 82. But as a rationalist 
	he will be well aware of the fact that his belief can be wrong and that 
	there is no logic or evidence behind such a belief. Usually the reason for 
	beliefs unsupported by logic and evidence is gut instinct, intuitions etc, 
	something that all humans (rationalist or not) are subject to, due to 
	biological evolution. For example a person may instinctively feel scared by 
	the presence of some people in certain neighbourhood (The fear translates 
	into a belief that those people will harm him). A woman may feel threatened 
	by some man, in both cases there being no conclusive evidence or logic to 
	justify that fear. Someone might feel scared walking in a graveyard alone at 
	night. But all such fear will still not be inconsistent with rationalism as 
	fear is an instinct, instincts are biologically hardwired in the primitive 
	part of the brain, not generated by the thinking part of the brain (cortex). 
	Rationalism is a result of brain's cognitive process, although whether a 
	person's brain will generate rational thinking or not may in part be 
	genetically hardwired. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What characterizes a rationalist is 
	that he/she can reflect on him/herself from a third person perspective and 
	recognize his/ her belief as not being a truth statement (proposition), but 
	only a belief due to personal reasons and consciously aware of the 
	possibility of his beliefs being wrong. The same is true in forming 
	judgmental opinions of others. If any such judgment is not conclusively 
	supported by sound logic (people often justify their opinion of others based 
	with logic that contains fallacies in it) then a rationalist will only take 
	a tentative opinion of others, if at all he/she has to. This may sound 
	obvious but it is surprising to see how many people forming opinions not 
	based on sound logic about others with smug conviction about their being 
	right about it. Even some &quot;freethinkers&quot; have been seen to jump to a 
	conclusion about someone using flawed logic. For example when a person A 
	says &quot;B says that X is true&quot;, it will be a fallacy for C to conclude that A 
	is implying that X is true. It only means that A is saying that B is 
	implying that X is true. It also does not mean that A is implying that X is 
	true in order to offer it as evidence that Y is true. Such fallacious 
	opinions are not uncommon among freethinkers as well. As I mentioned it
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What about a belief in God and soul? 
	The statement &quot;One will die at 82&quot; is a proposition, a statement that is 
	unambiguously true or false. There is nothing undefined or ill-defined in 
	that belief. In the case of a belief in God or Soul it is a bit more tricky. 
	The question is whether belief in God or Soul contradicts logic or evidence. 
	It depends on how one defines God or Soul. These words have defied a 
	unanimous, logical, objective definitions. Many definitions end up in 
	self-contradictions. In some definitions such a belief does contradict logic 
	and/or evidence (as in most religions), in others they don't (Almost 
	invariably in these cases the definitions reduce to labeling some existing 
	set of notions, no new objective reality is discovered). One can define God 
	in an abstract sense as the first cause of the laws of physics and then hold 
	the belief that such a first cause exists, or one can hold a belief that 
	there is no first cause of the laws of physics, the laws of physics are the 
	very cause of everything (universe). Both view would be consistent with 
	rationalism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How about belief in paranormal, 
	UFOs, apparitions etc? Again it is not against rationalism to admit the 
	possibility that these phenomena might be real, that these are not mere 
	illusions of the mind, but are unexplainable events. It is also not against 
	rationalism to believe that these are illusions of the mind or are just 
	hoaxes. But to assert one view or the other as absolute truth or fact, and 
	that personal testimonies provide an evidence for asserting them as truth or 
	fact is contrary to rationalism. As an example I wish to refer to a debate 
	in Mukto-Mona forum on paranormal phenomena where Ali Sina suggested his 
	personal testimony as evidence for the existence of paranormal [Check </font>
	<a style="TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="../rationalist_debate.html">
	<font size="4">Debate on Rationalism</font></a><font size="4"> </font>
	<font face="Verdana">in MM] . While it is 
	perfectly consistent with rationalism to hold personal belief in the 
	existence of paranormal due to personal testimony, it is certainly against 
	rational thinking to out the personal testimony as an evidence for the 
	existence of paranormal phenomena. On the other extreme it is also against 
	rationalism to assert as truth that these personal testimonies are hoaxes, 
	fraud or illusions. Another example is UFO. Ufologists cite the sheer volume 
	of personal testimonies (many of which are from credible people) as 
	conclusive evidence of visitation of aliens. Whereas Physicist Michio Kaku 
	only admits the possibility that UFO sightings CAN POSSIBLY be due to 
	aliens. There is a clear difference. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let me focus on ideology and 
	morality vs. rationalism. It should be clear that science and 
	rationalism does not have any inherent value judgment in them. There is no 
	normative element in rationalism. Ideological beliefs are by nature value 
	laden. Certain ideological social views are not objective statement of 
	facts, so are not dictated by rationalism. Examples of such ideologies are 
	views on homosexual issues (like gay marriage), abortion rights, communism 
	versus capitalism (in the sense of economic systems) etc. On many issues on 
	morality and ethics, one cannot take a rational stand without the help of 
	some additional moral axioms. In logic one draws a conclusion using valid 
	rules of inferences starting from one or more premises( axioms). So to form 
	a rational conclusion on an issue of morality one has to rely on some axiom 
	or premise. An example of a premise may be to adopt &quot;it is immoral to kill 
	an innocent life&quot; as a moral axiom. Is the conclusion &quot;abortion is immoral&quot; 
	then rational? If life is understood as defined in biology then it certainly 
	is. If life is redefined as a human being after birth then it is not a 
	rational conclusion. So the problem reduces to unambiguously defining &quot;Life&quot; 
	in the axiom &quot;it is immoral to kill an innocent life&quot;, to decide if the 
	conclusion is valid or not. Although science defines life unambiguously, 
	that definition will not be acceptable to those who have adopted an a priori 
	stand that abortion is not immoral, as that definition will contradict their 
	ideological stand. At least we can see that taking either position on 
	abortion is consistent with rationalism. But it will be inconsistent with 
	rationalism to adopt one definition of life in one context and another 
	definition in another context. That will be a fallacy of equivocation, nd 
	rationalism is inconsistent with logical fallacies. In the case of abortion 
	we saw that because of the ambiguity of the word &quot;Life&quot;, it is not possible 
	to assign a rational status on a stand on abortion. But in cases where a 
	moral axiom is expressed in unambiguous terms and is universally accepted as 
	an axiom, then it is possible to decisively judge if a conclusion based on 
	the axiom is rational or not.</font></p>
