&nbsp;</div>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary Schwartz, author of
	<i>The Afterlife Experiments: Breakthrough Scientific Evidence of Life After 
	Death</i> (Atria 2003), has collected “extraordinary data in many 
	experiments over many years” that support the hypothesis that consciousness 
	is independent of the brain and survives the death of the brain (268). That 
	the spirit survives the death of the body is something that many people on 
	our planet already believe, so it is not clear exactly what impact this data 
	will have on the billions of people who already strongly believe in 
	immortality or reincarnation. True, most people come to such beliefs by 
	being taught them from birth onward and by growing up in communities where 
	such beliefs are constantly reinforced. Many of these people also have 
	anecdotal evidence to support their belief. But Schwartz thinks his 
	scientific data might have an enormous impact. Presumably, one impact would 
	be that even skeptics would come to accept what he calls “the living soul 
	hypothesis.” <br>
	<br>
	Schwartz devotes the entirety of chapter 18 of <i>The Afterlife Experiments</i> 
	to “How Our Lives Might Change” if “science proves human souls live 
	forever.” He claims that “if you knew, once and for all, that consciousness 
	stayed with us forever,” then “you would realize and believe that … your 
	time here on the earth is for the purpose of learning advance lessons of 
	love and compassion, and for you to honor the many gifts you have received 
	by learning how to give to your family, friends, community, and the world as 
	a whole” (238).<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far, believing in the living soul hypothesis hasn’t led to 
	a widespread adherence to the noble values he lists. Why would scientific 
	proof make things any different? It’s not like the believers in spirits <i>
	doubt</i> that they will live forever or be reincarnated, so why would these 
	data change things? For example, Schwartz seems to think that if we had 
	scientific proof of the afterlife, we wouldn’t exploit the earth’s resources 
	with abandon (241). Yet, thousands of years of very strong belief in the 
	afterlife by the majority of our species has not produced a very loving 
	attitude towards the planet. We can’t blame the atheistic materialist for 
	destroying our environment. The vast majority of the destroyers are strong 
	believers in the afterlife hypothesis. The vast majority of those who are 
	raping the earth and exploiting our natural resources to the detriment of 
	humankind believe in spirits and do not doubt that they will live forever. 
	Why would they stop being selfish and destructive once the scientific proof 
	is in that there is an afterlife? The destroyers now rationalize their 
	behavior to justify it. Even if they had scientific proof of the afterlife, 
	it is likely that they would find a way to justify continuing their current 
	behaviors, lifestyles, and values.<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sympathize and agree with the values Gary Swartz wants to 
	encourage: finding meaning and purpose in our lives, “realizing that we have 
	the potential to be compassionate human beings with a supreme capacity to 
	love” (240). But I don’t see how scientific proof of the afterlife is going 
	to increase the implementation of these values. Many people already believe 
	with all their heart and soul in the afterlife and they seem to think that 
	that is what gives meaning and purpose to their lives. Yet, they still 
	persecute their earthly neighbors, allow the destruction of the planet, and 
	spend a great part of their lives worrying about and striving for material 
	treasures. Most people may not be <i>philosophical materialists</i>­who 
	believe there is no spiritual reality­but most are still <i>crass 
	materialists</i>, defining their happiness according to their wealth, power, 
	status, or accumulation of material possessions.<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I’m not as optimistic as Schwartz is about the possible 
	effects of finding scientific proof for the afterlife hypothesis. Some of 
	his speculations, in fact, seem silly. For example, he writes: “if you had 
	been cruel to a person, who then died, how would you feel if you knew 
	scientifically and without doubt that he or she would still be around? Would 
	you want to face him or her when it was your time to ‘cross over’”? (241) 
	What is the offended spirit going to do? Kill the offender? Haunt him? We’re 
	going to live forever whether we’re nice or cruel. In any case, I would hate 
	to think that the main thing that motivates people to be kind to others is 
	that they might haunt you in this life or harass you in the next. I would 
	hope we’d be kind to others because we’d like them to treat us kindly and 
	until shown otherwise they don’t deserve to be treated unkindly. We really 
	don’t have any right to be cruel to anyone. Being kind to others has 
	beneficial consequences, regardless of scientific proof of the afterlife. 
	Kindness resonates and not only makes the kind person feel good, the 
	kindness is often reciprocated. Anyone who has observed the difference in 
	happiness and well being between kind and unkind people knows the benefits 
	of kindness far outweigh the drawbacks. In short, of all the reasons I can 
	think of for being kind to others, the last one that would occur to me is 
	fear of being haunted by a ghost or of having to meet my victim 
	spirit-to-spirit for a face-off in the afterlife.<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of Schwartz’s speculations are downright scary. For 
	example, if science proves the afterlife hypothesis, then, asks Schwartz “is 
	it possible that mediums may serve as deceit detectors, giving us messages 
	from beyond that confirm who is lying to us?” (242) If they do ever serve as 
	“deceit detectors,” one hopes the mediums will be more reliable than the 
	polygraph.<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writes Schwartz: “As people everywhere become skilled at 
	receiving information from the departed, help from the other side could in 
	principle give each of us, directly or indirectly, the ability to discern 
	who is being fair and honest with us, and who is being unjust and deceptive” 
	(242). Perhaps this could happen if the “info-energy systems”­Schwartz’s 
	term for soul­are omniscient. Otherwise, why trust information just because 
	it comes from a spirit? For all we know, the dead lie just like the living 
	do.<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schwartz admits that some of his speculations “may sound 
	laughable and unworthy” (243). For example, he posits the possibility of 
	dead people being called as witnesses in criminal trials, “especially if 
	they are the victims in cases of murder” (244).&nbsp; Maybe we shouldn’t give 
	convicted murderers the death penalty, says Schwartz, because “the victim 
	might not be in a hurry to see his murderer in the afterlife.” Schwartz 
	wonders who should receive credit if a patent is obtained by someone who got 
	the discovery from a creative dead person. He notes that suicide might 
	increase if people have no reason to fear death (246).&nbsp; We’ll have to change 
	our view of the mentally ill: “the diagnosis of delusion and hallucination 
	will have to be reconsidered” (247). It might be “necessary to have skilled 
	mediums added to integrative mental health teams to help differentially 
	diagnose and treat people in general, and also help those who are especially 
	fearful of seeing aspects of spiritual reality” (248).&nbsp; Yes, it is possible 
	that skeptics might be declared mentally ill, suffering from <i>spiritphobia</i>, 
	a morbid fear of spiritual reality. As Schwartz says, it is tempting to 
	dismiss these “startling possibilities” by “simply labeling them as weird or 
	worthless” (250). One such idea is what he calls “spiritual education.”<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children, he notes, often report seeing ghosts and angels. Maybe 
	they’re really seeing spirits and should be encouraged to “cultivate these 
	experiences” so that by the time they are adults “these latent talents [of 
	seeing spirits] might be developed into meaningful skills that could 
	substantially aid society” (246). I presume that dead medical doctors would 
	assist the living in separating those cases of true delusion caused by brain 
	disease or neurochemical disorder from the spiritual prodigies, so that the 
	former might get the proper treatment.<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Schwartz is hopeful that scientific proof of the 
	afterlife might bring religious institutions together. However, strong 
	belief in the spirit world hasn’t united religions in the past. Schwartz 
	offers no reason to think that having scientific proof of the spirit world 
	will have a significant effect on institutional harmony among Muslims and 
	Christians, or Jews and Muslims, or Hindus and Sikhs, or Muslims and Baha’i, 
	or Hindus and Muslims, and the many other religious groups trying to 
	annihilate each other. In short, if Schwartz is right, nothing will be any 
	different than it is now. How much more useless could a discovery be than 
	one that will probably go by unnoticed?<br>
