	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A few weeks ago, an Indian teenager, 
	Saurabh Singh, was able to fool India into believing that he had topped an 
	international science exam conducted by NASA. The President of India, Dr A P 
	J Abdul Kalam is believed to have met him after he made his claim. The Uttar 
	Pradesh state government and legislature awarded him half a million Indian 
	Rupees and every legislator gave up a month’s salary to a fund for the boy. 
	The boy’s story was itself farcical. He claimed (depending on which 
	newspaper report one believes) to have stayed either at the Buckingham 
	Palace or at a hotel in London, a city that he flew to on an Indian Airlines 
	flight (the airline does not fly there) and took a taxi to Oxford University 
	and back every day. The very idea seemed preposterous and yet Saurabh Singh 
	got a lot more than his totally undeserved fifteen minutes of fame with his 
	ridiculous claim. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This was not the first time that 
	someone had gotten away with a massively fraudulent claim of this kind and 
	managed to get the media’s fawning attention. Ramar Pillai, a fraud who 
	claimed to create gasoline fuel from water by boiling a few leaves in it, 
	still has his supporters especially the Swadeshi Jagran Manch convenor and 
	Hindu activist, S Gurumurthy. One of India’s largest circulated magazines, 
	The Week, carried a cover story on Pillai with the editors’ visions of a 
	future India that was a huge sheikhdom of sorts selling fuel made from 
	common water to the rest of the world, despite several scientists professing 
	their grave reservations about this fraud. In my own small way, I had a 
	Letter of mine to the editor of The Indian Express published suggesting that 
	this was a fraud that went far beyond Pillai, an attempt at selling organic 
	solvents that were used to adulterate gasoline as fuel on the market. A few 
	years later, the whole mess proved to be just that. And yet Pilla! i’s fan 
	club did not let him down. S Gurumurthy would meet Director General of 
	Police, D Mukherjee several times claiming that Pillai was indeed a 
	“scientist” and not the swindler that he certainly was. While it would be 
	fallacious to suggest that Gurumurthy was involved in this fraud, there is 
	no denying that his judgement had been seriously influenced by his desire to 
	believe in his religion and it’s scriptures. An otherwise successful 
	investigator of several cases of corporate fraud, his need to believe in his 
	religion had left him looking silly. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But then, if the President of India, 
	a scientist himself, could be fooled along with the legislature of one of 
	India’s most populous states by a charlatan, Gurumurthy, a believer in 
	miracles and religious mumbo jumbo was definitely a much easier target. And 
	therein lies a pattern that works not just with prominent names like 
	President Kalam and S Gurumurthy but also millions of common religious 
	people worldwide. The propagandists of religion have perfected the art of 
	deceiving their followers and those who seek to combat this charlatanry do 
	have their work cut out. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There have been even funnier 
	incidents in the past. The Ganesha milk drinking episode, the monkey man 
	hoax, and even earlier incidents like Maharshi Mahesh Yogi’s “flight” 
	demonstrations which turned out to be jumping demonstrations - the list is 
	long enough to demonstrate that it is indeed possible to fool most believers 
	most of the time. And the media has invariable been a willing accomplice in 
	this process, driven as it is to this in the rush to sell itself to it’s 
	audience. Some years ago, the Times of India, on some festival at the 
	Tirupati temple in south India, got itself some writer who claimed that 
	according to some scripture, a dry branch that was thrown into the temple 
	pond at some “auspicious” time would turn green. Had this been offered with 
	a disclaimer, it would have been to the Times’ credit. The newspaper was 
	obviously focused on selling four colour pages as an advertising supplement 
	and it allowed this complete nonsense in as an article probably as a perk to 
	! the advertisers. The fact also is that the Times had become just one more 
	witting accomplice to those who would spread fundamentalism and foolishness 
	among believers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This foolishness among believers is 
	something that comes out of the exclusivist nature of all religions. Every 
	religion claims a monopoly on “eternal truth” and offers it’s followers 
	“miracles.” Accepting a certain religion and it’s regulations, restrictions 
	and teachings in toto guarantees rewards in life according to proselytizers 
	who seem to have moved away from offers of an afterlife to people who are 
	increasingly reluctant to believe in one. Dr Kalam as a Muslim Indian and S 
	Gurumurthy as a Hindu are both religious people. Kalam has made no secret of 
	the fact that he begins his day with a reading of the Qur’an and 
	Gurumurthy’s harangues against Christians and Muslims on his website and the 
	pages of the Indian Express are very well known in India. Both are extreme 
	nationalists, too, and probably reserve a portion of their daily prayers for 
	the country. Perhaps, it was this combination of religiosity and patriotism 
	that left each of them anticipating a miracle in the two in! stances 
	mentioned here. And whatever happened left both men looking like complete 
	ignoramuses in each instance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is this same arrogance and 
	smugness that permeates all religious fundamentalists. The recent Asian 
	tsunami saw claims from Indonesia to India of religious structures having 
	been “spared” destruction never mind that 200,000 people were killed. If a 
	mosque survived in Aceh, there was talk about the San Thome cathedral 
	surviving in Chennai, India and the Hindus found that the receding sea water 
	had left one of 7 pagodas that had sunk in the sea some centuries earlier 
	exposed in a half ruined form. To each of these religions it was a “sign” 
	though what the sign was supposed to reveal is something that no one seemed 
	to know. Even as far as religious matters are concerned, fundamentalism and 
	ignorance do seem to go together.</font></td>
