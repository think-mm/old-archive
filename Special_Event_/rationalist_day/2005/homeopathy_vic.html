	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	Since its inception over 200 years ago, homeopathy has fallen in and out of 
	favor. Its apparent resurgence in these times has rekindled the discussion 
	as to whether homeopathic medications are an effective treatment against 
	disease or whether they are no more than an elaborate placebo. The 
	discussion as to whether or not it is an effective therapy is ongoing in 
	human and veterinary medicine; it appears to have devolved into one between 
	proponents of homeopathy and those who rely on firm evidence of 
	effectiveness before adopting any therapy. This review attempts to assess 
	the state of the current evidence regarding homeopathy.

	<h2>History</h2>
	The German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) is generally acknowledged 
	to be the founder and developer of homeopathy, although some of his concepts 
	appear very early in medical history.1 Dissatisfied with the state of 
	medicine at the time, which included bleeding, purging, cupping and 
	excessive doses of mercury, he ceased his medical practice in 1782 and began 
	translating medical and chemical texts. It was during this time that he 
	apparently began to seriously question the proposed mechanisms of drug 
	activity of his contemporaries. 
	<p>Hahnemann followed a tradition that viewed disease as a matter of the 
	vital force or spirit. The concept of the vital spirit appears to be one of 
	the earliest speculations in recorded medical history and similar forces 
	form the proposed basis for any number of metaphysical health practices. It 
	is an alleged nonmaterial &quot;force&quot; that sustains life and for which there is 
	no objective evidence.2 According to Hahnemann, &quot;The causes of our maladies 
	cannot be material, since the least foreign material substance, however mild 
	it may appear to us, if introduced into our blood-vessels, is promptly 
	ejected by the vital force, as though it were a poison....no disease, in a 
	word, is caused by any material substance, but that every one is only and 
	always a peculiar, virtual, dynamic derangement of the health.&quot;3 </p>
	<p>Consistent with this philosophy is the belief that it is more important 
	to pay attention to symptoms than to the external causes of disease. Knowing 
	the specific symptoms of illness, treatment is then a matter of finding a 
	substance or substances that induced the same symptoms in a healthy 
	individual. This is the basis of Hahnemann's &quot;Principle of Similars.&quot; The 
	work of Pasteur and Koch on inoculations with very small amounts of weakened 
	disease-causing microbes seemed to support this notion at the time. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Hahnemann and his followers went on to test the effects of almost 100 
	substances on themselves, a process known as &quot;proving.&quot; The typical 
	procedure was for a healthy person to ingest a small amount of a particular 
	substance and then attempt to carefully note any reaction or symptom 
	(including emotional or mental reactions) that occurred. By this method, 
	Hahnemann and his followers &quot;proved&quot; that the substance was an effective 
	remedy for a particular symptom. That such a method of determining the 
	effectiveness of a treatment is implausible and at least open to the power 
	of suggestion should be inarguable. In fact, in one controlled study, 
	healthy subjects reported similar symptoms whether given a homeopathic 
	dilution of belladonna or a placebo.4 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Nevertheless, the collected experiences of such incidents became the 
	basis for a compendium called the Materia Medica. Because some of the 
	substances tested were toxic (such as poison ivy, strychnine and various 
	snake venoms), during a proving it made sense to ingest minuscule doses. 
	This may be the source or the homeopathic principle of &quot;infinitesimal 
	dilutions&quot; in which the most dilute solutions are alleged to be the most 
	potent. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;The origin of the principle of &quot;potentization&quot; is more obscure. 
	Potentization purports to make the diluted, inert substance active by 
	releasing its energy. According to Hahnemann: &quot;Homeopathic potentizations 
	are processes by which the medicinal properties of drugs, which are in a 
	latent state in the crude substance, are excited and enabled to act 
	spiritually upon the vital forces.&quot;5 Simple dilution of a drug is 
	insufficient to produce a cure. To achieve potentization, after each 
	successive 1-to-9 (&quot;D&quot;) or 1-to-100 (&quot;C&quot;) dilution, the solution must be 
	shaken vigorously (the process is known as &quot;succussion&quot;). In the case of a 
	powdered substance, it must be vigorously ground up (trituration). 
	Potentization purports to liberate the energy of the substance being used 
	for treatment and this liberated energy purportedly remains, even in the 
	lowest doses. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Hahnemann believed that homeopathic remedies must be appropriately 
	prescribed for individual body types and personalities, based on the ancient 
	humoral theories of Galen. According to these theories, there were four body 
	types and personalities, based on which body &quot;humor&quot; predominated: blood 
	(sanguine, warm-hearted and volatile), black bile (melancholic, sad), yellow 
	bile (choleric, quick to anger and to action) and phlegm (phlegmatic, 
	sluggish and apathetic). In addition to describing a few basic body types, 
	he also suggested that there are a corresponding few primary causes of acute 
	and chronic illnesses, which he called &quot;miasms.&quot; The first miasm, known as 
	&quot;psora&quot; (itch) refers to a general susceptibility to disease and may be 
	considered the source of all chronic diseases. The other two miasms in 
	homeopathic theory are the venereal diseases syphilis and sycosis 
	(gonorrhea). Together, these three conditions were considered to be the 
	cause of at least 80 per cent of all chronic diseases. </p>
	<p>Homeopathy has made several important indirect contributions to the 
	practice of medicine. At the time that it was developed, the medical 
	treatments of the time were often more dangerous than the disease that they 
	purported to treat. Indeed, homeopathy may have helped hasten the demise of 
	such treatments. Homeopathy provided the initial idea and source for useful 
	drugs such as nitroglycerin6 and aconite.7 Early scientists such as Joseph 
	Lister and Sidney Ringer stated that they were led to important 
	pharmacological discoveries because of homeopathy.8 Homeopathy has also been 
	given credit for providing early support for clinical trials with control 
	groups, systematic and quantitative procedures and the use of statistics in 
	medicine.9 </p>
	<p>From the standpoint of veterinary medicine, it is curious that Hahnemann 
	did none of his work on animals. Psora, syphilis and gonorrhea are not 
	conditions recognized in animals. The fallacy of prescribing medications for 
	animals based on how they make people feel seems obvious given interspecies 
	variations between reactions to various pharmacologic substances. The 
	concepts of prescribing medications for body types and personalities would 
	seem to be particularly difficult to apply to animals, as well. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;It should be obvious that the premises upon which Hahnemann's work were 
	based are difficult to support based on current knowledge. From a strictly 
	hypothetical standpoint it is possible that Hahnemann came up with the right 
	conclusion from the wrong reasons. However, while criticisms based solely on 
	the origin of the philosophy may not be entirely damning, they are, at 
	least, instructive. <br>
	&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>The Physics of Homeopathy</h2>
	If homeopathic remedies are effective, there is a mechanism by which they 
	work. It is a fact that the mechanism of action by which they might work has 
	not been established. If the remedies do work, they must do so in a manner 
	which would appear to violate established principles of physics, chemistry 
	and pharmacology or they must work in a manner which is yet to be 
	discovered. As one early critic of homeopathy wrote, &quot;Either Hahnemann is 
	right, in which case our science and the basis of our thinking is nonsense, 
	or he is wrong, in which case this teaching is nonsense.&quot;10 
	<p>&nbsp;By successively diluting the initial substance, extremely dilute 
	solutions can be made rather quickly. The dilution limit is reached when the 
	volume of the solute is unlikely to contain a single molecule of the 
	solvent. The limit recognizes that there is a large but finite and specific 
	number of atoms or molecules in a mole of substance (a mole is the molecular 
	weight of a substance, expressed in grams). That number of atoms or 
	molecules is 6.022 X 10<sup>23</sup>, also known as Avogadro's number. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Homeopathic remedies are diluted by either a factor of 10 or 100. &quot;D&quot; 
	dilutions are prepared by serial dilutions of 1:10; &quot;C&quot; dilutions are 
	prepared by serial dilutions of 1:100. Thus, a remedy marked C30 would imply 
	a 1:100 dilution performed 30 times. By simple mathematics, it can be 
	calculated that at dilutions of C12 or D24 or greater, it is not likely that 
	the remedies contain even a single molecule of the original substance. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Since the original substance is not present in extremely dilute 
	homeopathic remedies, explanations for a mechanism of action of homeopathic 
	medications have moved towards speculation. Such proposals include the 
	formation of stable ice crystals, magnetic properties of water or the 
	formation of protein shells in the water mixture.11 Water molecules are 
	highly polarized, a fact that already accounts for much of the special role 
	of water in biology. However, the likelihood that water can maintain a 
	complex ice-like structure under the vigorous shaking that usually 
	accompanies homeopathic preparation has not been demonstrated. Neither has 
	any physical mechanism by which such hypothetical structures can produce the 
	implied biological effects. </p>
	<p>Some of the hypotheses appear to be completely insupportable. Speculation 
	that the mechanism of action of homeopathic medications is somehow related 
	to biological magnetite have been criticized by the investigator who 
	discovered the substance as lacking any foundation and based on a 
	misunderstanding the structure of magnetite.12 Water is also not 
	ferromagnetic. </p>
	<p>Structural changes in matter appear to be easily demonstrable in other 
	applications, using such techniques as transmission electron microscopy, 
	spectroscopy, ultraviolet transmission characteristics, X-rays and 
	ultrasound. If they exist, structural changes in the composition of 
	homeopathic remedies should be relatively easy to detect. So far, such 
	changes have not been demonstrated. One ultrasonographic study failed to 
	show differences between homeopathic remedies and water.13 On an empirical 
	basis, even a homeopathic practitioner and his patients were unable to 
	distinguish between two different homeopathic remedies with &quot;strikingly 
	different properties&quot; over nine years of testing.14 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;From a physical standpoint, structural changes in the water of extremely 
	dilute solutions seem unlikely. Structural studies of water/alcohol mixtures 
	will show regions of local order. However, these regions are transient; 
	depending on the temperature, they can only last for the briefest of times. 
	For most materials, local order does not persist in the liquid phase (the 
	problem is entropy).15. The exceptions are liquid crystals, whose highly 
	elongated molecules are still not able to move about freely when the liquid 
	phase is reached. There has never been the slightest hint, from theory or 
	experiment, that water can form a liquid crystal. </p>
	<p>It may also be postulated that there is some sort of biologic effect of 
	homeopathic medications that is independent of known physical laws. Of 
	course, such speculation would be virtually impossible to test and there is 
	no known substance which fits such parameters. Appealing to unknown laws to 
	explain undocumented phenomena simply falls outside the framework of 
	legitimate science. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Further physical difficulties with the concept of homeopathic dilutions 
	relate to the fact that many such remedies come in the form of lactose 
	tablets. In these instances, the homeopathic dilution is applied to the 
	pill, which serves as a carrier. Of course, the diluted liquid must 
	evaporate, which leads to the question of how the information is transferred 
	from liquid to lactose tablet. Other questions include why the diluted 
	mixture would remember only the healing powers of the active substance but 
	forget the side-effects or why the water doesn't remember other things with 
	which it might have been in contact. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;The fact that there is no known mechanism by which extremely dilute 
	homeopathic medications should be able to exert a biological effect is 
	indeed a source or concern to proponents of homeopathy. In fact, if proposed 
	mechanisms can be shown to be insupportable, the Director of the Office of 
	Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health has written that, 
	&quot;highly speculative and imaginary [sic] explanations may be necessary.&quot;16 As 
	a Nobel Prize winning physicist noted, &quot;The theory of quantum 
	electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common 
	sense. And it agrees fully with experiment.&quot;17 From a mechanistic point of 
	view, however, homeopathy neither makes sense nor agrees with any 
	experiment. Accordingly, most discussions of the possible effects of 
	homeopathy prefer to focus on discussions of results of studies. </p>
	<p>&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>In Vitro Studies</h2>
	In 1988, homeopathy was thrust into the forefront of controversy with the 
	first publication of work supporting effects of homeopathic solutions in a 
	mainstream science journal. The authors of the paper suggested that 
	extremely dilute solutions of antiserum against human IgE were able to 
	induce basophil degranulation.18 Although the experimental model chosen is 
	known to be extremely unstable, the journal in which the study was published 
	could find no apparent flaws. Subsequent to publication, however, the 
	journal sent an investigating team to the laboratory which concluded that 
	there were serious flaws in the original investigation.19 That a war of 
	words subsequently commenced is inarguable. More to the point is that at 
	least three separate investigators using identical or similar experimental 
	models have failed to reproduce the results.20, 21, 22 
	<p>In fact, the only studies which indicate an in vitro effect of 
	homeopathic dilutions come from the same laboratory. The lead investigator 
	of the studies has since gone on to claim that homeopathic information has 
	been digitized and can be transferred by computer disk over the Internet. 
	Furthermore, his immunopharmacology laboratory has been shut down by INSERM, 
	the French medical research agency.23 Finally, a libel claim by the 
	investigator against two French Nobel prize winners who called the 
	investigator a fraud was recently thrown out of French courts.24 </p>
	<p>&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>Reviews and Meta-Analyses</h2>
	When trying to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathic 
	remedies, it is possible to find investigations in which positive, negative 
	or no results are reported. Evaluation of the literature for any form of 
	therapy is difficult and studies vary as to quality. Such a problem appears 
	to be particularly acute in the evaluation of literature concerning 
	alternative therapies such as homeopathy. For example, investigators in one 
	study categorized all 204 articles in one year's editions of four journals 
	on alternative medicine as positive, neutral or negative. They found 64 per 
	cent of the papers were classified as helpful, 35 per cent as neutral and 
	only 1 per cent as negative. The investigators concluded that there is a 
	strong publication bias in favor of positive conclusions about alternative 
	therapies and that their findings imply that the literature is not 
	objective.25 
	<p>One way to attempt to answer the question of the effectiveness of 
	homeopathic medications is to look at reviews and meta-analyses (studies of 
	studies). Of course, whether by review or by meta-analysis, attempts at 
	reviewing any medical literature are not without their own problems. Reviews 
	have been criticized as being subject to the bias of the reviewer. On the 
	other hand, meta-analyses, which attempt to gather information and draw 
	conclusions by pooling various reports have been much criticized for using 
	many &quot;weak&quot; studies to arrive at a &quot;strong&quot; conclusion and for relying on 
	the subjective opinions of the authors to determine which studies are worthy 
	of inclusion, among other reasons.26 Further concern about the validity of 
	meta-analysis comes from recent work which indicates disagreement between 
	meta-analysis and subsequent large, randomized, controlled clinical trials 
	in as many as 35 per cent of the cases studied.27 </p>
	<p>Nevertheless, several reviews and meta-analyses on homeopathy have been 
	performed. Apparently, their results are open to some interpretation. That 
	interpretation may, at first glance, seem to be no more than a &quot;glass 
	half-empty or half-full&quot; argument between proponents of homeopathy and those 
	of evidence-based medicine. Thus, for the purposes of review, it seems most 
	useful to quote the conclusions of the studies rather than take individual 
	bits of data out of them. The authors were able to find four meta-analyses 
	and six reviews of the effects of homeopathic medications. Three of the 
	reviews specifically relate to veterinary medicine. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;In 1985, a chapter on veterinary homeopathy concluded that, &quot;Contrary to 
	what you hear or read too often, rigorous scientific demonstration of the 
	therapeutic effect of homeopathic remedies in veterinary medicine has not 
	yet been done. Although it may seem exaggerated to conclude that homeopathy 
	has absolutely no place, from a pragmatic point of view (and relative among 
	animal owners...), in veterinary medicine, it is obvious that future works 
	will have to bend to the new modern methodologies in order to be able to 
	take away the firm beliefs of stern minds.&quot;28 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;A 1990 review of 40 published randomized trials of homeopathy in human 
	medicine found that most of the studies had major methodological flaws and 
	concluded that, &quot;the results do not provide acceptable evidence that 
	homeopathic treatments are effective.&quot;29 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;A 1991 meta-analysis of homeopathy in human medicine concluded, &quot;At the 
	moment the evidence of clinical trials is positive but not sufficient to 
	draw definitive conclusions because most trials are of low methodological 
	quality and because of the unknown role of publication bias. This indicates 
	that there is a legitimate case for further evaluation of homeopathy, but 
	only by means of well performed trials.&quot; The investigators also noted that, 
	&quot;Critical people who do not believe in the efficacy of homeopathy before 
	reading the evidence presented here probably will still not be convinced; 
	people who were more ambivalent in advance will perhaps have a more 
	optimistic view now, whereas people who already believed in the efficacy of 
	homeopathy might at this moment be almost certain that homeopathy works.&quot;30 
	In a later letter, the authors noted that, &quot;The results of our review would 
	probably be interpreted differently if laboratory studies showed convincing 
	evidence that there is some action of high potencies.&quot;31 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;A 1992 German review of homeopathy concluded that, &quot;Due to the advance 
	of alternative medicine a critical synopsis by means of the comparison 
	between scientific medicine (clinical medicine) and homeopathy is warranted. 
	The review of studies carried out according to current scientific criteria 
	revealed - at best - a placebo effect of homeopathy. Until now there is no 
	proven mechanism for the mode of action of homeopathy. Sometimes so-called 
	&quot;alternative medicine&quot; prevents effective curative measures. In spite of the 
	justified criticism concerning the technical over-estimation of classical 
	medicine, scientific research should remain the basis of clinical work.&quot;32
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;A 1993 German review of homeopathy in veterinary medicine makes several 
	conclusions: </p>
	<p>&nbsp;* &quot;Doctor and veterinarian are similarly obligated to apply the 
	therapeutic measure that prevailing opinions deem most effective. Where 
	there is for particular definite illnesses a particularly effective and 
	generally recognized treatment, in such cases the supporters of homeopathy 
	may not disregard the better successes from their own differing direction.&quot;
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;* It is undisputed that homeopathy in the area of stronger potency can 
	achieve effects pharmacologically and toxicologically; the superiority of 
	homeopathy as a therapeutic measure in comparison with conventional therapy 
	methods is at this point not verified. Moreover, the harmlessness of 
	homeopathy in stronger potency is for the most part not verified. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;* The effectiveness of homeopathy in middle and high potencies is up to 
	now not verified. It is undisputed that with the help of homeopathy, not 
	insignificant placebo effects can be achieved. In veterinary medicine, 
	giving an animal an 'active' placebo and another a 'passive' can play a 
	significant role and influence the owner.&quot;33 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;A 1994 review and meta-analysis of serial agitated dilutions (SAD) in 
	experimental toxicology stated that, &quot;As with clinical studies, the overall 
	quality of toxicology research using SAD preparations is low. The majority 
	of studies either could not be reevaluated by the reviewers or were of such 
	low quality that their likelihood of validity is doubtful. The number of 
	methodologically sound, independently reproduced studies is too small to 
	make any definitive conclusions regarding the effect of SAD preparations in 
	toxicology.&quot;34 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;A 1996 review of homeopathy, concluded that: </p>
	<p>&nbsp;* &quot;No one should ignore the role of non-specific factors in therapeutic 
	efficacy, such as the natural history of a given disease and the placebo 
	effect. Indeed, these factors can be used to therapeutic advantage.&quot; </p>
	<p>&nbsp;* &quot;As homeopathic treatments are generally used in conditions with 
	variable outcome or showing spontaneous recovery (hence their placebo 
	responsiveness), these treatments are widely considered to have an effect in 
	some patients.&quot; </p>
	<p>&nbsp;* &quot;However, despite the large number of comparative trials carried out 
	to date there is no evidence that homeopathy is any more effective than 
	placebo therapy given in identical conditions.&quot; </p>
	<p>&nbsp;* &quot;We believe that homeopathic preparations should not be used to treat 
	serious diseases when other drugs are known to be both effective and safe.&quot;
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;* &quot;Pending further evidence, homeopathy remains a form of placebo 
	therapy.&quot;35 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;A 1997 meta-analysis concluded, &quot;The results of our meta-analysis are 
	not compatible with the hypothesis that the clinical effects of homeopathy 
	are completely due to placebo. However, we found insufficient evidence from 
	these studies that homeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single clinical 
	condition.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;Our study has no major implications for clinical 
	practice because we found little evidence of effectiveness of any single 
	homeopathic approach on any single clinical condition.&quot; The authors 
	concluded by calling for more research, &quot;providing it is rigorous and 
	systematic.&quot;36 One critic of the study cautioned that when the best trials 
	were examined, the odds of a positive effect of the therapy were distinctly 
	lower than in the overall study.37 Another critic suggested further caution 
	in interpreting the results of this study by noting that negative trials may 
	have been less likely to be published, which may have skewed the analysis. 
	38 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Another meta-analysis conducted in 1997 examined the use of homeopathy 
	for the treatment of postoperative ileus, measured by the time to first 
	flatus. The investigators concluded that their analyses &quot;do not provide 
	evidence for the use of a particular homeopathic remedy or for a combination 
	of remedies for postoperative ileus. Several drawbacks inherent in the 
	original studies and in the methodology of meta-analysis preclude a firm 
	conclusion.&quot; Given those caveats, the study also suggested that homeopathic 
	dilutions less than 12C (those which may contain some of the original 
	substance) had a significant effect, whereas dilutions greater than 12C had 
	none.39 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;A 1998 review of homeopathic treatment in animals suggested approaching 
	homeopathy with an &quot;open mind.&quot; As evidence for the effectiveness of 
	homeopathic treatment in animals, the study cites 3 studies in which some 
	clinical evidence of effectiveness was seen, 7 in which the results were 
	difficult to interpret for various reasons and 6 in which there was no 
	response to treatment or worsening of the condition. Several of the studies 
	cited were performed on healthy animals. In one of the studies in which the 
	condition of sick animals worsened, the worsening of the animal's health is 
	taken as possible evidence of treatment effectiveness, according to 
	&quot;Herring's Law.&quot;13 Critics would note that such a &quot;law&quot; or &quot;healing crisis&quot; 
	would mean that one can't lose when administering homeopathic medications 
	because whether the patient improves or gets worse, the treatment may be 
	viewed as being successful. </p>
	<p>Very few, if any, of the researchers conducting animal and in vitro 
	studies on homeopathy have been rigorously conducted. Properly blinded, 
	randomized experiments with high dilution homeopathic preparations and both 
	a placebo group and a known effective treatment group with a large number of 
	animals and predefined outcome variables that examine the effect on diseases 
	(rather than production efficiency) are absent in veterinary homeopathy. In 
	addition, researchers have been guilty of not reporting differences (if such 
	existed) between the homeopath and placebo groups.33 While the animals (and 
	tissue preparations) may not be susceptible to suggestibility, clearly the 
	researcher making the critical observations could be influenced. One would 
	hope that animals researchers would also be aware of the pioneering work of 
	Pavlov showing that animals are often responding to any change in their 
	environment which could obviously be confused with a response to homeopathic 
	medication.40 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Subsequent to submission of the most recent meta-analysis in human 
	medicine, several good trials of homeopathic medications have been conducted 
	in human medicine. Randomized, placebo-controlled double blind studies have 
	shown homeopathic remedies to be ineffective in the treatment of adenoid 
	vegetations in children,41 for control of pain and infection after total 
	abdominal hysterectomy42 and for prophylaxis of migraine headache.43, 44 
	Furthermore, to date, no single study of homeopathy showing positive results 
	has been successfully replicated. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Curiously, the lack of good evidence of effectiveness of homeopathic 
	remedies may be irrelevant to supporters of homeopathy. One leading advocate 
	asserts that proving the effectiveness of homeopathy through scientific 
	research is not important and suggests that personal experience is more 
	important that any number of carefully controlled studies.45 Positive 
	expectations and beliefs of patients and healers have historically resulted 
	in reports of excellent or good outcomes in more than 70 per cent of cases 
	even though the treatments given are now known to have been worthless.46 </p>
	<p>&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>Is homeopathy safe?</h2>
	Safety is, of course, vital to the discussion of any form of therapy. In 
	fact, most conclusions are that homeopathic remedies are largely safe. Such 
	a finding would, of course, not be unexpected were the remedy to contain 
	only a water and/or alcohol solvent (that is, that the solution would 
	contain none of the original substance). 
	<p>&nbsp;However, while infrequent, there are reports of adverse reactions to 
	homeopathic medications. Adverse reactions have been reported ranging from 
	pruritis and a measles-like skin rash to anaphylactic shock,47 from 
	pancreatitis48 to contact dermatitis.49 In regards to the safety of 
	homeopathic remedies, the previously cited 1996 review stated that, &quot;Serious 
	adverse effects have been reported with low dilutions (&lt;4CH) given 
	parenterally or orally. However, high dilutions (&gt;5CH) administered orally 
	or sublingually appear to be entirely safe. We believe that homeopathic 
	preparations should not be used to treat serious diseases when other drugs 
	are known to be both effective and safe. In addition, regardless of the 
	condition treated, dilution below 5CH (e.g. 3 or 4CH and especially decimal 
	dilutions or mother tinctures) must not only be considered as having no 
	proven efficacy but also as having potential dangers.&quot;33 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Further concerns as to safety arise from the apparent attitude against 
	immunization by practitioners of homeopathic therapy. In human medicine, 
	several surveys have demonstrated that homeopathic practitioners routinely 
	advise their clients against immunization.50, 51, 52, 53 Such an attitude 
	would appear to be completely insupportable in light of the tremendous 
	advances made in the protection from disease that vaccination clearly and 
	reliably affords. The origin of homeopathic antipathy to vaccination is 
	unknown; there is nothing in Hahnemann's writings against immunization.54 It 
	may arise from a general hostility towards modern medicine that, according 
	to studies, appears to be prevalent within complementary medicine in 
	general.55, 56 </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Homeopathic practitioners may also employ the use of &quot;homeopathic 
	vaccines&quot; or &quot;nosodes&quot; prepared from high dilutions of infectious agents, 
	material such as vomitus, discharges or fecal matter or infected tissues. 
	Curiously, nosodes are not prepared according to homeopathic principles, 
	rather, they would be more properly described as being isopathy. Hahnemann 
	himself decried the use of such preparations. 57 There is no evidence at all 
	to suggest that such &quot;immunizations&quot; have any effectiveness.58 There is one 
	case reported in the human literature where a patient followed her 
	homeopath's advice and took a homeopathic immunization against malaria 
	before traveling to an endemic area. The patient promptly got malaria.59 
	Homeopathic nosodes have failed to protect dogs from death due to parvoviral 
	enteritis.60 Even given the concerns regarding potential problems with 
	immunization in animals, it is virtually inconceivable that an ethical 
	medical practitioner would recommend against the use of proven effective 
	vaccine prophylaxis for diseases such as rabies, parvoviral enteritis or 
	viral encephalitis (to name a few). Vaccination arguably constitutes the 
	single most successful public health measure in human history. </p>
	<p>&nbsp; </p>
	<h2>Ethics</h2>
	Any discussion of homeopathy also entails consideration of ethical issues. 
	As homeopathy is unquestionably unproven, it seems clearly unethical to 
	merely give the therapy to an animal and its trusting owner and wait and see 
	what happens.61 Furthermore, social morality would demand that the client be 
	fully informed of the experimental nature of the therapy and consent to it 
	before it is provided. It would also seem clearly unethical to employ an 
	unproven therapy such as homeopathy in cases where an acceptable and 
	effective treatment already exists or where the patient is at risk for 
	greater suffering if the unproven therapy fails.62 Further ethical 
	considerations require that proof of effectiveness be established if safety 
	and efficacy questions have not been documented, as is the case with 
	homeopathy. It would also seem reasonable to expect that if a professional 
	community intends to employ an unproven remedy, said community has the 
	ethical obligation to engage in proper clinical research to help establish 
	or disprove the effectiveness of that remedy.63 <br>
	&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp; 
	<h2>Discussion</h2>
	It is difficult to precisely determine what homeopathy is today. Homeopathy 
	as a single, unified school of thought simply does not exist.64 One report 
	has noted that, &quot;There are as many homeopathies as there are homeopaths.65 
	Furthermore, the ready availability of mass-marketed, non-prescription 
	homeopathic remedies would appear to violate Hahnemann's principle of 
	individualizing therapy based on the symptoms of each patient.56 
	Additionally, the mere fact that homeopathy is a treatment philosophy based 
	exclusively on the recognition and treatment of symptoms would seem to 
	contradict claims made by advocates that homeopathy treats the whole 
	patient, whereas &quot;traditional&quot; medicine is merely treats the symptoms of 
	disease.1 
	<p>&nbsp;It is interesting to compare the course of progress between medications 
	such as aspirin and homeopathy. It was known for many hundreds of years that 
	chewing on willow bark helped relieve pain and inflammation. The active 
	component of aspirin, initially called salicin, was isolated in 1823, not 
	long after the advent of homeopathy. In 1899, a derivative of salicin, 
	acetylsalicylic acid, was developed and marketed for the first time. The 
	mechanism of action of aspirin began to be uncovered about fifty years 
	later. From this basic information, a proliferation of useful non-steroidal 
	anti-inflammatory drugs developed, leading to the most recent advancements 
	of so-called Cox-2 inhibitors. This process of development has been advanced 
	through the contributions of innumerable investigators, starting with Bayer 
	and continuing today. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;Contrast that situation with that of homeopathy. After over two hundred 
	years, there is no single condition for which homeopathy is proven to be 
	effective. The mechanism of action is unknown. The principles of therapy 
	have remained unchanged since it was discovered by its founder and 
	individuals who employ the therapy have added little to the original tenets. 
	If homeopathy is science, it appears not to be advancing. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;One simple explanation for the purported effects of homeopathy would be 
	that it is a placebo. Such an explanation would answer the many various 
	questions regarding the therapy. Were homeopathic medications placebo, no 
	physical mechanism by which they could have an effect would be expected to 
	be found. The results of clinical trials would be expected to be frequently 
	confusing, disappointing and/or irreproducible if such trials were in fact 
	comparing one placebo to another. Higher dilution medications would 
	certainly be expected to be safe if they were merely water, water/alcohol 
	mixtures or lactose tablets. Such an explanation, while understandably 
	objectionable to proponents of the therapy, also appears to be reasonable, 
	adequate and sufficient, given the current state of research. </p>
	<p>Were homeopathy to prove an effective therapy, it would be irrational for 
	any legitimate medical practitioner to ignore or fail to employ it. Given 
	the apparent lack of adverse effects from high dilution homeopathic 
	remedies, such a therapy should be readily embraced if it were effective. 
	Indeed, open-mindedness is one of the hallmarks of science and the rapid 
	assimilation of new therapies and technologies has been a consistent 
	characteristic of scientific medicine. In fact, studies have shown that 
	practitioners of mainstream medicine are less dogmatic than those of its 
	alternatives.66, 67 To quote the late Dr. Carl Sagan, &quot;...at the heart of 
	science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory 
	attitudes -- an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or 
	counterintuitive, and the most ruthlessly skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, 
	old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense.&quot;68 </p>
	<p>There is nothing wrong with the hypothesis that homeopathic remedies, no 
	matter how implausible, are effective. However, such a hypothesis is 
	amenable to scientific testing. Proper trials of homeopathic remedies should 
	be easy to conduct. However, whether they are evaluated by review, by 
	meta-analysis or by postulated physical mechanism, there is no good evidence 
	to date that homeopathic remedies are effective treatments for any condition 
	in human or in veterinary medicine. Nor is there evidence that they are 
	superior to already established therapies. </p>
	<p>Every practitioner of medicine requires faith in his or her methods in 
	order to be confident. However, faith is not a legitimate foundation on 
	which to build a practice of scientific medicine. Furthermore, in order for 
	people to change their minds, they must have a good reason to do so; mere 
	faith is not such a reason. Advocates of ethical medicine and veterinary 
	science demand reliable evidence of both efficacy and safety before 
	employing therapies to treat their patients. Thus, the question remains; if 
	homeopathic remedies are safe and effective, why have its practitioners and 
	proponents been unwilling or unable to conduct the proper trials and 
	research required to prove it? <br>
