  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A year ago, late professor Humayun 
	Azad, a noted linguist and leading freethinker of Dhaka University was 
	brutally attacked on February 27, 2004 in front of Bangla Academy where he 
	was attending the Book fair, which has become a seasonal event. In that 
	attack, the assailants wanted to chop off Prof. Azad’s head. However, 
	because of the presence of many book fair-goers the assailant could not do 
	their job. In the process, though, they injured him with repeated chops in 
	the neck and head areas resulting in his comatose condition. For a few days, 
	his well-wishers thought he would not return from his long slumber. By 
	surprising everyone, Prof. Azad’s senses came back and he took a slow road 
	to rehabilitation, which required a number of plastic surgeries on his face 
	to efface the brutal mark of the attack he received on that fateful day.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I have mentioned, it took several 
	weeks before Prof. Azad could sit and talk. The attack resulted in a loss of 
	considerable amount of blood. Naturally, he was very infirm and visibly 
	shaken due to the personal injury. At the insistence of Dhaka University 
	faculty, the government sent him to Bangkok for further treatment. After his 
	return, most of his friends heaved a sigh of relief thinking that worst was 
	over. Little did they know what was coming! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prof. Azad was a broken man after 
	the attack. After all, he was a proud son of the soil. The physical attack 
	did destroy his ego and tell me why it should not do such terrible damage to 
	his self-respect. Prof. Azad was a bold person who never shied away from 
	speaking his mind. His forthrightness and fearless approach to truth seeking 
	put him in collision course with the obscurantist Mullahs, Jamaatis, and 
	other fringes of Bangladesh polity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prof. Azad taunted the loser of 1971 
	freedom struggle, the Jamaatis, through his satirical novel “Pak Saar 
	Jamin.” Days before his attack, one of the elder leaders of Jamaat had 
	openly showed his disdain for Humayun Azad. To them, Azad was a murtaad or 
	apostate. Therefore, he was an easy game (read target) for fundamentalist 
	goons. Goaded by Maulana Delwar Hossain Saydee, an MP from Southern part of 
	Barisal and a member of the inner circle of Jamaat and the four-part 
	alliance government, a handful of assailants came to Ekushey Book Fair. They 
	knew the author loved to mingle freely with his readers. Azad was a free 
	spirit who thought no harm could ever come to him. But how wrong was he. 
	This brutal attack did him in by robbing his free spirit. As I wrote 
	earlier, Dr. Azad’s pride was long gone and he was devastated by the tenor 
	of the attack. No man wanted to see a disfigured face of his in the mirror. 
	It probably was too painful for him to see that the attack had left 
	permanent scar on his face. Azad was a very sensitive human being. It is 
	almost a prerequisite for a writer of his caliber to be too sensitive about 
	everything - his persona, look, and deportment - you name it. Seeing one’s 
	disfigured face or permanent scar, artificial tooth, is not all that 
	pleasant. These have caused much anguished in him. I felt it as I read his 
	swan song that was published in late July 2004 in Dhaka’s vernacular 
	newspaper Janakantha. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I had the opportunity to translate 
	that evocative article of Azad into English. One could never translate 
	Azad’s piece. It was written using a profoundly complex language with a 
	profusion of metaphor. After the translation was done right before his trip 
	to Munich, Germany, the piece was e-mailed to him in Dhaka for his approval. 
	He Okayed the translation, which was published by Mukto-mona, a 
	freethinkers’ forum in the cyberspace. In that piece, Prof. Azad made a fine 
	prognosis of the tortuous path Bangladesh is treading now. He was alarmed by 
	the spate of bomb blasts, attacks on intellectuals. He was petrified by the 
	ferocity of the attack. His family started to receive non-stop barrage of 
	menacing phone calls, his son was almost kidnapped, and he could not bear it 
	all. Under this dire circumstance, he reluctantly had accepted a fellowship 
	to visit a university in Munich, Germany. Prof. Azad never did recover from 
	the pernicious attack done by the shadowy fundamentalist goons. His 
	infirmity got the upper hand and he breathed his last immediately after 
	reaching Munich in the beginning of August 2004. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prof. Humayun Azad was already a 
	marked man when his publisher printed the first run of his book “Pak Sar 
	Jamin” (Bless the pure land). The ire of fundamentalists fell on him right 
	away because the author had unmasked the masquerading Maulanas who suddenly 
	had become the greatest patriot in the land through the hard work of Khaleda 
	Zia and her party machinery. The cantonment politics that led to the 
	assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975 had started the 
	Islamization of Bangladesh. The party BNP is a direct result of this 
	cantonment intrigue. In the guise of “multiparty democracy,” an army General 
	had unleashed the Islamists who were barred from joining the politics. The 
	brutal assassination of that army General led to the entry of a charlatan 
	army General who also pushed the nation towards the path of fundamentalism. 
	In 15 years time from 1976 through 1990, the nation changed her demeanor 
	from secular to quasi-religious state. Prof. Azad was keenly aware of this 
	transformation. He wanted to mock the Maulanas who were at the forefront of 
	this vital transformation and who were the real engine of this societal 
	metamorphosis. Naturally, he had to pen something on this. And he did. In a 
	way, his writings did him in. The obscurantist Maulanas hated his guts and 
	they gave fatwas, which certainly “inspired” young jihadis who came with 
	full force to decapitate him on February 27, 2004. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Who is the loser now that Prof. Azad 
	is gone from Bangladesh forever? The nation lost a freethinker, undoubtedly. 
	The Dhaka University is sore loser because Prof. Azad died a bit 
	prematurely. In Bangladesh there is a severe crisis going on in the field of 
	freethinking. The void left by his death would be difficult to fill. There 
	is already a dearth of true freethinking scholars in the academia in 
	Bangladesh. That is the reason I say that it was a great loss for the 
	campus. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prof. Humayun Azad would have walked 
	the corridors of art faculty right now. To our knowledge, his was a healthy 
	person. Nonetheless, the brutal attack that he took on that night made his 
	world topsy-turvy. He was never the same again. I point finger at the 
	resurgence of religious fervor that resulted in his premature death. The 
	Bangla culture took a severe blow from fundamentalist camp on that fateful 
	night. It is an utter shame that the government failed to protect a 
	courageous son of the soil. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I was writing this piece on 
	February 22, 2005, I read in the Internet that a bunch of Madrassah students 
	was arrested near Savar who were found carrying bomb-making paraphernalia. 
	It seems as if Dr. Azad’s prognosis was correct after all. He clearly 
	pointed finger at the wrongdoers. Bangladesh has created a monster out of 
	Madrassah students. Instead of receiving proper education, many of them had 
	been indoctrinated into Talibanism. The present government turned a blind 
	eye to the developing problem. The government’s view was that all of these 
	were a part of propaganda. The proverbial chickens have come home to roost 
	and they don’t even get it right. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On this anniversary day of the 
	brutal attack on Prof. Humayun Azad, let me say that the humanity was raped 
	in Bangladesh on February 27, 2004. We all know that the stealth evil force 
	killed a dozen or so leading intellectuals in the fag end of our freedom 
	fight in December 1971. They could not efface freethinking and progressivism 
	from this deltaic land. Now they think they could do the same. Their fang 
	should be surgically removed so that future Humayun Azads of Bangladesh 
	could voice their opinion against obscurantism and monolithic views which if 
	allowed to grow would devour this society. Who wants to live in a 
	Talibanized Bangladesh? Prof. Azad would have loathed the idea anyway.
