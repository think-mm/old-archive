			<em>Quantum physics is claimed to support the mystical notion that

			<hr>
			<img height="316" alt="" src="stenger1.jpg" width="250" align="right"> 
			Certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, the revolutionary 
			theory developed early in the century to account for the anomalous 
			behavior of light and atoms, are being misconstrued so as to imply 
			that only thoughts are real and that the physical universe is the 
			product of a cosmic mind to which the human mind is linked 
			throughout space and time. This interpretation has provided an 
			ostensibly scientific basis for various mind-over-matter claims, 
			from ESP to alternative medicine. &quot;Quantum mysticism&quot; also forms 
			part of the intellectual backdrop for the postmodern assertion that 
			science has no claim on objective reality. 
			<p>The word &quot;quantum&quot; appears frequently in New Age and modern 
			mystical literature. For example, physician Deepak Chopra (1989) has 
			successfully promoted a notion he calls quantum healing, which 
			suggests we can cure all our ills by the application of sufficient 
			mental power. </p>
			<p>According to Chopra, this profound conclusion can be drawn from 
			quantum physics, which he says has demonstrated that &quot;the physical 
			world, including our bodies, is a response of the observer. We 
			create our bodies as we create the experience of our world&quot; (Chopra 
			1993, 5). Chopra also asserts that &quot;beliefs, thoughts, and emotions 
			create the chemical reactions that uphold life in every cell,&quot; and 
			&quot;the world you live in, including the experience of your body, is 
			completely dictated by how you learn to perceive it&quot; (Chopra 1993, 
			6). Thus illness and aging are an illusion and we can achieve what 
			Chopra calls &quot;ageless body, timeless mind&quot; by the sheer force of 
			consciousness.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> </p>
			<p>Amit Goswami, in The Self-Aware Universe: How Consciousness 
			Creates the Material World, argues that the existence of paranormal 
			phenomena is supported by quantum mechanics: </p>
			<blockquote>
				<em>. . . psychic phenomena, such as distant viewing and 
				out-of-body experiences, are examples of the nonlocal operation 
				of consciousness . . . . Quantum mechanics undergirds such a 
				theory by providing crucial support for the case of nonlocality 
				of consciousness. (Goswami 1993, 136) </em>
			</blockquote>
			Since no convincing, reproducible evidence for psychic phenomena has 
			been found, despite 150 years of effort, this is a flimsy basis 
			indeed for quantum consciousness.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> 
			<p>Although mysticism is said to exist in the writings of many of 
			the early century's prominent physicists (Wilber 1984), the current 
			fad of mystical physics began in earnest with the publication in 
			1975 of Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (Capra 1975). There Capra 
			asserted that quantum theory has confirmed the traditional teaching 
			of Eastern mystics: that human consciousness and the universe form 
			an interconnected, irreducible whole. An example: </p>

			<p>Capra's book was an inspiration for the New Age, and &quot;quantum&quot;

			</p>
			<h2>Wave-Particle Duality</h2>
			Quantum mechanics is thought, even by many physicists, to be 
			suffused with mysteries and paradoxes. Mystics seize upon these to 
			support their views. The source of most of these claims can be 
			traced to the so-called wave-particle duality of quantum physics: 
			Physical objects, at the quantum level, seem to possess both local, 
			reductionist particle and nonlocal, holistic wave properties that 
			become manifest depending on whether the position or wavelength of 
			the object is measured. 
			<p>The two types of properties, wave and particle, are said to be 
			incompatible. Measurement of one quantity will in general affect the 
			value the other quantity will have in a future measurement. 
			Furthermore, the value to be obtained in the future measurement is 
			undetermined; that is, it is unpredictable-although the statistical 
			distribution of an ensemble of similar measurements remains 
			predictable. In this way, quantum mechanics obtains its 
			indeterministic quality, usually expressed in terms of the 
			Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In general, the mathematical 
			formalism of quantum mechanics can only predict statistical 
			distributions.<sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup> </p>
			<p>Despite wave-particle duality, the particle picture is maintained 
			in most quantum mechanical applications. Atoms, nuclei, electrons, 
			and quarks are all regarded as particles at some level. At the same 
			time, classical &quot;waves&quot; such as those of light and sound are 
			replaced by localized photons and phonons, respectively, when 
			quantum effects must be considered. </p>
			<p>In conventional quantum mechanics, the wave properties of 
			particles are formally represented by a mathematical quantity called 
			the wave function, used to compute the probability that the particle 
			will be found at a particular position. When a measurement is made, 
			and its position is then known with greater accuracy, the wave 
			function is said to &quot;collapse,&quot; as illustrated in Figure 1. </p>

					<td><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Wave function collapse in 
					conventional quantum mechanics. An electron is localized by 
					passing through an aperture. The probability that it will 
					then be found at the particular position is determined by 
					the wave function illustrated to the right of the aperture. 
					When the electron is then detected at A, the wave function 
					instantaneously collapses so that it is zero at B. </td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			</center><hr>Einstein never liked the notion of wave function 
			collapse, calling it a &quot;spooky action at a distance.&quot; In Figure 1, a 
			signal would appear to propagate with infinite speed from A to B to 
			tell the wave function to collapse to zero at B once the particle 
			has been detected at A. Indeed, this signal must propagate at 
			infinite speed throughout the universe since, prior to detection, 
			the electron could in principle have been detected anywhere. 
			<p>This surely violates Einstein's assertion that no signals can 
			move faster than the speed of light. </p>
			<p>Although they are usually not so explicit, quantum mystics seem 
			to interpret the wave function as some kind of vibration of a 
			holistic ether that pervades the universe, as &quot;real&quot; as the 
			vibration in air we call a sound wave. Wave function collapse, in 
			their view, happens instantaneously throughout the universe by a 
			willful act of cosmic consciousness. </p>
			<p>In their book The Conscious Universe, Menas Kafatos and Robert 
			Nadeau identify the wave function with &quot;Being-In-Itself&quot;: </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<blockquote>
				<em>One could then conclude that Being, in its physical analogue 
				at least, had been &quot;revealed&quot; in the wave function. . . . [A]ny 
				sense we have of profound unity with the cosmos . . . could be 
				presumed to correlate with the action of the deterministic wave 
				function . . . .</em> (Kafatos and Nadeau 1990, 124)</blockquote>
			Thus they follow Capra in imagining that quantum mechanics unites 
			mind with the universe. But our inner sense of &quot;profound unity with 
			the cosmos&quot; is hardly scientific evidence. 
			<p>The conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics, promulgated 
			by Bohr and still held by most physicists, says nothing about 
			consciousness. It concerns only what can be measured and what 
			predictions can be made about the statistical distributions of 
			ensembles of future measurements. As noted, the wave function is 
			simply a mathematical object used to calculate probabilities. 
			Mathematical constructs can be as magical as any other figment of 
			the human imagination-like the Starship Enterprise or a Roadrunner 
			cartoon. Nowhere does quantum mechanics imply that real matter or 
			signals travel faster than light. In fact, superluminal signal 
			propagation has been proven to be impossible in any theory 
			consistent with conventional relativity and quantum mechanics 
			(Eberhard and Ross 1989). </p>
			<h2>Romantic Interpretations</h2>
			Not everyone has been happy with the conventional interpretation of 
			quantum mechanics, which offers no real explanation for wave 
			function collapse. The desire for consensus on an ontological 
			interpretation of quantum mechanics has led to hundreds of proposals 
			over the years, none gaining even a simple majority of support among 
			physicists or philosophers. 
			<p>Spurred on by Einstein's insistence that quantum mechanics is an 
			incomplete theory, that &quot;God does not play dice,&quot; subquantum 
			theories involving &quot;hidden variables&quot; have been sought that provide 
			for forces that lie below current levels of observation (Bohm and 
			Hiley 1993). While such theories are possible, no evidence has yet 
			been found for subquantum forces. Furthermore, experiments have made 
			it almost certain that any such theory, if deterministic, must 
			involve superluminal connections.<sup><a href="#6">6</a></sup> </p>
			<p>Nevertheless, quantum mystics have greeted the possibility of 
			nonlocal, holistic, hidden variables with the same enthusiasm they 
			show for the conscious wave function. Likewise, they have embraced a 
			third view: the many worlds interpretation of Hugh Everett (Everett 
			1957). </p>
			<p>Everett usefully showed how it was formally possible to eliminate 
			wave function collapse in a quantum theory of measurement. Everett 
			proposed that all possible paths continue to exist in parallel 
			universes which split off every time a measurement is made. This has 
			left the door open for the quantum mystics to claim that the human 
			mind acts as sort of a &quot;channel selector&quot; for the path that is 
			followed in an individual universe while existing itself in all 
			universes (Squires 1990). Needless to say, the idea of parallel 
			universes has attracted its own circle of enthusiastic proponents, 
			in all universes presumably. </p>
			<h2>Effective Nonlocality</h2>
			Admittedly, the quantum world is different from the world of 
			everyday experience that obeys the rules of classical Newtonian 
			mechanics. Something beyond normal common sense and classical 
			physics is necessary to describe the fundamental processes inside 
			atoms and nuclei. In particular, an explanation must be given for 
			the apparent nonlocality, the instantaneous &quot;quantum leap,&quot; that 
			typifies the non-commonsensical nature of quantum phenomena. 
			<p>Despite the oft-heard statement that quantum particles do not 
			follow well-defined paths in space-time, elementary-particle 
			physicists have been utilizing just such a picture for fifty years. 
			How is this reconciled with the quantum leap that seems to 
			characterize atomic transitions and similar phenomena? We can see 
			how, in the space-time diagram shown in Figure 2. </p>

					fluctuation so that there is zero net-energy change. The

			</center><hr>On the left, an electron (e-) is moving along a 
			well-defined path. An electron-positron pair (e-e+) is produced at 
			point C by a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum, allowed by the 
			uncertainty principle. The positron annihilates the original 
			electron at point A while the electron from the pair continues past 
			point B. Since all electrons are indistinguishable, it appears as if 
			the original electron has jumped instantaneously from A to B. 
			<p>In Figure 2, all the particles involved follow definite paths. 
			None moves faster than the speed of light. Yet what is observed is 
			operationally equivalent to an electron undergoing superluminal 
			motion, disappearing at A and appearing simultaneously at a distant 
			point B. No experiment can be performed in which the electron on the 
			left can be distinguished from the one on the right. A simple 
			calculation shows that the distance AB is of the order of the (de 
			Broglie) wavelength of the particle. In this manner, the &quot;holistic&quot; 
			wave nature of particles can be understood in a manner that requires 
			no superluminal motion and certainly no intervention of human 
			consciousness. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, since the quantum jump is random, no signal or other 
			causal effect is superluminally transmitted. On the other hand, a 
			deterministic theory based on subquantum forces or hidden variables 
			is necessarily superluminal. </p>
			<p>Thus quantum mechanics, as conventionally practiced, describes 
			quantum leaps without too drastic a quantum leap beyond common 
			sense. Certainly no mystical assertions are justified by any 
			observations concerning quantum processes. </p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			Quantum mechanics, the centerpiece of modern physics, is 
			misinterpreted as implying that the human mind controls reality and 
			that the universe is one connected whole that cannot be understood 
			by the usual reduction to parts. 
			<p>However, no compelling argument or evidence requires that quantum 
			mechanics plays a central role in human consciousness or provides 
			instantaneous, holistic connections across the universe. Modern 
			physics, including quantum mechanics, remains completely 
			materialistic and reductionistic while being consistent with all 
			scientific observations. </p>
			<p>The apparent holistic, nonlocal behavior of quantum phenomena, as 
			exemplified by a particle's appearing to be in two places at once, 
			can be understood without discarding the commonsense notion of 
			particles following definite paths in space and time or requiring 
			that signals travel faster than the speed of light. </p>
			<p>No superluminal motion or signalling has ever been observed, in 
			agreement with the limit set by the theory of relativity. 
			Furthermore, interpretations of quantum effects need not so uproot 
			classical physics, or common sense, as to render them inoperable on 
			all scales-especially the macroscopic scale on which humans 
			function. Newtonian physics, which successfully describes virtually 
			all macroscopic phenomena, follows smoothly as the many-particle 
			limit of quantum mechanics. And common sense continues to apply on 
			the human scale. </p>
