  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This Tuesday (March 8) is 
	International women's day (IWD). First, some brief historical note. The 
	first IWD was observed on March 19, 1911 in Germany, Austria, Denmark and 
	Switzerland, pursuant to a decision taken at Copenhagen the previous year by 
	The Socialist International to establish an international day for Women, to 
	honour the movement for women's rights and to assist in achieving universal 
	suffrage for women. No date was specified in the Copenhagen declaration. 
	Since then, IWD was observed on last Sunday of February each year until 
	1917. In Russia where Julian calendar was used, the last Sunday of February 
	1917 fell on March 8 according to Gregorian calendar. Russian women chose 
	that day to strike for &quot;bread and peace&quot;. Their strike contributed among 
	other factors, to the fall of Czar four days later. Since that time IWD 
	began to be observed on March 8 every year. The date was made official in 
	1921 for universal observance as International Women's day all over the 
	world at the suggestion of the Bulgarian delegates at the 1921 Socialist 
	International meeting. On the eve of this IWD, I just wish to mention the 
	accomplishments of some international women in areas that were (and still is 
	to a great extent) exclusively male dominated, that should be a source of 
	inspiration to women of Bangla. Although much of the lack of substantial 
	achievement of Bangla women in many areas that are exclusive to men is due 
	to hostile social attitude, part of the reason is also that many women 
	themselves have been conditioned by ingrained social attitude to believe 
	that its not proper for women to go into those professions. Its good to see 
	that against all the odds (specially due to religious conservatism), women 
	are still making headway. The very fact I have to cite women's achievement 
	to prove that they are not inherently less capable points to the problem of 
	the ingrained stereotype that persists. In a way one could argue it is the 
	burden of those who think women are inferior to back up their claim rather 
	than the reverse. True, but it is also true that by citing these 
	achievements may serve as eye openers for some who choose keep their eyes 
	closed and not budge from their ingrained view of women's inferiority unless 
	provoked by these eye opening facts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me cite some inspiring 
	historical facts on women's ability and then move on to more recent ones.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Women have displayed martial bravery 
	no less impressive then men. In our own subcontinent we have read the story 
	of Lakkhi (Laxmi) Bai, the queen of Jhansi (in Madhya Pradesh). She resisted 
	the invasion of Lord Dalhousie's British army, and led a rebel army against 
	him, making the supreme sacrifice in the battle (in 1858). In our own 
	Bangla/Bengal we read about the bravery of Pritilota Waddadar (1911-1932), 
	Surja Sen's able companion rebel against the colonial British. Not many know 
	that she also earned a BA degree with distinction from Calcutta University 
	in 1932 and was appointed the headmistress of Nanda Kanan school in 
	Chittagong at the young age of 22. Most know about her famous attack of the 
	European Club in Pahartoli (Chittagong) on September 4, 1932. She committed 
	suicide by cyanide poisoning during that attack.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Much earlier, The Zenata Berber 
	tribe, led by the woman Kahina (prophetess) in North Africa defeated the 
	Muslim Army led by General Hassan Ibn Naaman during Umayyad Caliph Abdul 
	Malik Ibn Merwan in 695 AD. I am sure there are many more historical facts 
	about women's bravery. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now to modern time. It was a great 
	first for Bangla women to join the army around the time of last year's IWD. 
	They are yet to join as sailors and airmen (may be a new word airperson 
	should be coined) in navy and air force respectively. We had Yasmeen, a 
	female captain of DC-10 in Bangladesh Biman (probably the first/only in Asia 
	at that time (in the mid 80's). Unfortunately her career was cut short due 
	to political reasons prematurely. It is also unfortunate that the two female 
	pilots who were going to become Yasmeen's successor were both killed in 
	accidents while as co-pilots or in training as pilots. We know of another 
	female Biman airbus pilot in the making, Tania Reza. I am not sure if there 
	is any other women in flying crew anymore in Biman. I don't think we yet 
	have a female captain/co-captain of a merchant or naval ship, a female 
	helicopter, transport or fighter pilot yet. Someone may correct me if I am 
	wrong. Do we have any woman bus/ truck/train/launch drivers in Bangladesh 
	yet? I don't think so. We know in the West and possibly in Asia (certainly 
	there are women bus conductors in Bangkok) there are women in all those 
	professions. In the context of Bangladesh, the name of Papiya must be 
	mentioned. She was the first (Seems like the last) to dare to try to earn a 
	living by pulling a Rickshaw in Dhaka city. She carried male passengers too, 
	not just female. Her story was covered by Daily Star reporter Shehab Ahmed 
	under the title &quot;Tale of a Courageous Girl&quot; , probably around 1997-8, I am 
	not sure about the date. I managed to scan the report and saved it in my web 
	site ( <a href="http://www.geocities.com/aparthib/papiya.gif">
	http://www.geocities.com/aparthib/papiya.gif</a> ). One can look at it at:

	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Anyway, let me mention some 
	international naris who have achieved great success in such male-exclusive 
	domains, who may provide a source of inspirations to Bangla women. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The toughest, riskiest job for any 
	human in terms of skill and knowledge is known to be commanding a space 
	shuttle. Commander Eileen Collins has demonstrated that she can do that (And 
	to think that I feel scared every time I get aboard an airplane!). The 
	intellectually toughest field to excel is in superstring theory of 
	theoretical physics. This field holds the promise for the ultimate theory of 
	everything. Even noble Laureate physicist Weinberg is intimidated by its 
	formidable mathematical complexity. And here we have young <i>Eva 
	Silverstein</i>, an authority on Superstring theory, besides other women 
	like <i>Lisa Randall</i> (See an interview with Lisa Randall at:
	<a href="http://www.esi-topics.com/brane/interviews/DrLisaRandall.html">
	http://www.esi-topics.com/brane/interviews/DrLisaRandall.html</a> ) and 
	Shyamoli Chaudhuri (Asst Prof of Physics, Penn State University, at least 
	until 2001. See her page at:</font></p>

	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;). Before Superstring theory 
	was developed, Theoretical High Energy Physics was considered to be the 
	intellectually most challenging field. And there we had Chinese female Nobel 
	laureate Wu. One of the toughest physically challenging job is that of an 
	astronaut. Besides so many American women astronauts, we had Indian born 
	Kalpana Chawla, who lost her life prematurely in the tragic Columbia 
	disaster. She was not only a Nasa astronaut scoring 252 orbits around the 
	earth, but a PhD as well. Shannon Lucid, another women astronaut with a PhD 
	had the record for being longest in space. Then we have Jennifer Harris, the 
	mission manager for Sojourner Pathfinder ( Robot landing on Mars). </font>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On 18th May 1953, American 
	Jacqueline Cochran, aboard an F-86 Sabre jet, became the first woman to 
	break the sound barrier. Today an F-86 may be a dinosaur, but it was the 
	state of the art fighter in the 40's and early 50's. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I always feel a sense of awe every 
	time I fly on a Boeing-747 airplane. I wonder how challenging it must be to 
	be in command of such a behemoth of a plane. Commanding a 747 jumbo jet 
	seems to be a picnic for Susan Darcy, the first women to become a 
	full-fledged captain of a 747 in 1989. She also was the first woman to 
	become a full captain of the most sophisticated and computerized Boeing-777 
	in 1995. Darcy was also the lead pilot on the final Boeing 777-200 to enter 
	flight testing. Earlier to this, she also achieved captain status on the 
	Boeing 737 in 1987 and 757/767 in 1989. Darcy is cross-trained as an 
	instructor on the 737, 757, 767, 747-400 and 777 airplanes. She has done 
	flight instruction as well as flight testing in the United States, Europe 
	and Asia. Now how many men pilots can claim such impressive series of 
	accomplishments? (On a different note, Darcy is very attractive looking, 
	debunking the popular adage, often said humorously, but sometimes seriously, 
	that the smartest women are the least attractive looking!) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Out of about 131 cruise ships 3 are 
	captained by women (Data from year 2000, from a program on cruise ships on 
	Discovery channel). Although revealing a glaring gender disparity, the very 
	fact that such large and sophisticated cruise ships ARE being manned (rather 
	womanned!) by females testifies to the fact that no area is outside of 
	women's capability. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here's an inspiring historical 
	anecdote of Amalie Noether (Physics savvy folks should know about Noether's 
	theorem, one of the most profound theorems in Physics, with deep 
	philosophical implications). The anecdote is taken from p-572, &quot;Superstrings 
	and other things&quot; by Carlos Calle. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Amalie Noether, got her PhD with 
	Summa Cum Lauda from all male university of Erlangen in 1907. She was not 
	accepted at the university of Gottingen to work on Einstein's General Theory 
	of Relativity. Professor Hilbert, the lone contrarian among the faculty, 
	however allowed her to lecture in his class arguing that why should gender 
	be an argument against admission?. We are a university, not a bathing 
	establishment, he argued!. She was finally admitted as an instructor in 
	1919. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another women scientist Barbara 
	McClintock discovered transposons (&quot;Jumping gene&quot;) in corn in the 40's, but 
	got the recognition and Nobel prize for it in 1983 when she was 81! She got 
	her PhD from Cornell in 1927 but remained unemployed for many years due to 
	gender discrimination. Finally she got employed in Cold Springs Harbour 
	Laboratories and scientists finally recognized the importance of her work in 
	the 40's. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me mention some more women that 
	come to mind in professions that are not so exclusively male anymore but 
	still are not too women friendly either. For one thing, this list proves 
	that despite the proverbial glass ceiling that women face, the fact remains 
	that women have succeeded in climbing up the corporate ladder by sheer dint 
	of their competence. The glass ceiling is not unbreakable. The list below is 
	by no means exhaustive, and the positions mentioned below are either current 
	or were held at one time, either way it suffices to make the point. </font>

	Bangladesh can drive buses and autorickshaws, if they choose to, without
