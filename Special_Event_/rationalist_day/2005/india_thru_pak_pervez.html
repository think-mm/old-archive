	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2"><b>F</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ew 
	Pakistanis get to visit India, the so-called &quot;enemy country&quot;, and fewer 
	still to independently assess the development of science and education 
	across its hugely diverse regions. I had the exceptional good fortune to 
	make such a visit recently, made possible by the award of UNESCO's Kalinga 
	Prize for the popularization of science. One part of the Prize included a 
	4-week lecture tour that took me around India: Delhi, Pune, Mumbai, 
	Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bhubhaneswar, Cuttack, Calcutta, and then 
	back to Delhi again before I returned home to Islamabad in mid-February. 
	Although the Prize was awarded in 2003, frosty Pakistan-India relations had 
	made my tour impossible until 2005.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was a relentless 
	schedule from the first day onwards with several lectures daily at schools, 
	colleges, universities, research institutions, and peace groups. I chatted 
	with children from excellent schools as well as those from rather ordinary 
	ones; had long sessions with students and professors from colleges and 
	universities; met with the &quot;junta&quot; (cooks, taxi drivers, and rickshawallas); 
	and was invited to see ministers and chief ministers in several states, as 
	well as the president of India.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Some observations 
	follow:</b></font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Many Indian 
	universities have a cosmopolitan character and are world class. Their social 
	culture is secular, modern, and similar to that in universities located in 
	free societies across the world. (In Pakistan, AKU and LUMS would be the 
	closest approximations.) Male and female students freely intermingle, 
	library and laboratory facilities are good, seminars and colloquia are 
	frequent, and the faculty engages in research. Entrance exams are tough and 
	competition for grades is intense. Some universities, &quot;deemed universities&quot; 
	and other research institutions I visited (TIFR, IISC, IITs, IMSC, IICT, 
	IUCAA, JNCASR, IPB, Raman Institute, Swaminathan Institute,...) do research 
	work at the cutting edge of science. A strong tradition of mathematics and 
	theoretical science forms a backbone that<br>
	sustains progress in areas ranging from space exploration and 
	super-computing to nanotechnology and biotechnology.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· The rural-urban 
	divide, and the class divide in education, is strong. Schools and colleges 
	in small towns have a culture steeped in religion. Here one sees hierarchy, 
	obedience, and even servility. The national anthem is sung in schools and 
	religious symbols are given much prominence. Some students I met were 
	bright, but many appeared rather dull. Although most Indian colleges are 
	coeducational (unlike in Pakistan), male and female students sit separately 
	and are not encouraged to intermingle. It<br>
	is sometimes difficult to understand the English spoken there. Where 
	possible, I spoke in Hindi/Urdu. This enhanced my ability to communicate and 
	also created a certain kind of bonding. There is an evident desire to 
	improve, however, and at least some college principals go out of their way 
	to organize events and invite guest speakers. My lecture at the Basavanagudi 
	National College, a fairly ordinary college in Bangalore, was the 1978th 
	lecture given by academicians over a period of 30 years!</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Independent thought 
	in India's better universities is alive and well. Office bearers of the 
	Jawaharlal Nehru University students union in Delhi were requested by the 
	university's administration to present flowers to President Abdul Kalam at 
	the annual convocation. They flatly refused, saying that he is a nuclear 
	hawk and an appointee of a Hindu fundamentalist party. Moreover, as young 
	women of dignity they could not agree to act as mere flower girls presenting 
	bouquets to a man. Eventually the head of the physics department, also a 
	woman, somewhat reluctantly presented flowers to Dr. Kalam but said that she 
	was doing so as a scientist honoring another scientist, not because she was 
	a woman. Bravo!<br>
	I have not seen comparable boldness and intellectual courage in Pakistani 
	students. Student unions in Pakistan have been banned for two decades and so 
	it is a moot question if any union there could have mustered similar 
	independence of thought.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Taking science to 
	the masses has become a kind of mantra all over India. My columnist friend 
	Praful Bidwai - a powerful critic of the Indian state and its militaristic 
	policies - counts among India's greatest achievements the energisation of 
	its democracy and refers to &quot;our social movements, with their rich 
	traditions of people's self-organisation, innovative protest and daring 
	questioning of power&quot;. These movements have ensured that, unlike in 
	Pakistan, land grabbers in Indian cities have found fierce<br>
	resistance when they try to gobble up public spaces - parks, zoos, 
	playgrounds, historical sites, etc. Praful should also include in his list 
	the huge number of science popularization movements, sometimes supported by 
	the state but often spontaneous. These are sweeping through India's towns 
	and villages, seeking to bring about an understanding of natural phenomena, 
	teach simple health care, and introduce technology appropriate to a rural 
	environment. There is not even one comparable Pakistani counterpart. I 
	watched some science communicators, such as Arvind Gupta at IUCAA in Pune, 
	whose infectious enthusiasm leaves children thrilled and desirous of 
	pursuing careers in science. Individual Indian states have funded and 
	created numerous impressive planetariums and science museums, and local 
	organizations are putting out a huge volume of written and audio-visual 
	science materials in the local languages.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Attitudes of Indian 
	scientists towards science are conservative. Progress through science is an 
	immensely popular notion in India, stressed both by past and present 
	leaders. But what is science understood to be? I was a little jolted upon 
	reading Nehru's words, written in stone at the entrance to the Jawaharlal 
	Nehru Institute for Advanced Research in Bangalore: &quot;I too have worshipped 
	at the shrine of science&quot;. The notion of &quot;worship&quot; and &quot;shrine of science&quot; 
	do not go well with the modern science and the scientific temper. Science is 
	about challenging, not worshipping. As a secular man, Nehru was not given to 
	worship but his metaphorical allusions to industries and factories as 
	temples of science found full resonance. Indeed, science in India is largely 
	seen as an instrument that<br>
	enhances productive capabilities, and not as a transformational tool for 
	producing an informed, just, and rational society. Most Indian scientists 
	are techno-nationalists - they put their science at the service of their 
	state rather than the people. In this respect, Pakistan is no different.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· India's nuclear and 
	space programs are nationally venerated as symbols of high achievement. This 
	led to India's nuclear hero, Dr. Abdul Kalam, becoming the country's 
	president. When Dr. Kalam received me in his office, after the usual 
	pleasantries, I expressed my regret at India having gone nuclear and causing 
	Pakistan to follow suit. Shouldn't India now reduce dangers by initiating a 
	process of nuclear disarmament? Dr. Kalam gave me a well-practiced response: 
	India would get rid of its nuclear weapons the very minute that America 
	agreed to do the same. He displayed little enthusiasm for an agreement to 
	cut off fissile material production. However, he did agree to my suggestion 
	that exchange of academics could be an important way to build good relations 
	between<br>
	Pakistan and India.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Indian society 
	remains deeply superstitious, caste divisions are important, and women still 
	have a long way to go. While I found myself admiring the energetic popular 
	science movements, I was disappointed that they pay relatively little 
	attention to the anti-scientific superstitions widely prevalent in Indian 
	society. After I had given a strong pitch for fighting irrational beliefs at 
	a meeting of science popularization activists from villages in Northern 
	India, a young woman asked me what to do if &quot;koi devi aap pay utr jayai&quot; (if 
	a spirit should descend upon you). The jyoti (astrologer) dictates the dates 
	when a marriage is possible, and even whether a couple can marry at all. 
	When I was in Bangalore, hundreds of thousands had thronged to be cured by 
	an American faith-healing quack, Benny Hinn. Inter-caste marriages are still 
	frowned upon, and usually forbidden. In local newspapers one typically reads 
	of tragic accounts such as that of a boy and girl from different castes who 
	jointly commit suicide<br>
	after their families forbid the match. Although Indian women are freer, more 
	visible, and more confident than their Pakistani counterparts, India is 
	still a strongly male dominated society. However, the rapidly<br>
	increasing number of bold and well-educated young women gives hope for the 
	future.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Muslims in India 
	remain at the margins of scientific research and higher education. Hamdard 
	University in Delhi is distinctly better than the university bearing the 
	same name on the Pakistani side. Jamia Millia, a largely Muslim university, 
	appears to be doing well and probably better than any Pakistani university 
	in the field of physics. But, although Muslims form 12% of India's 
	population, I met only a few Muslim scientists in leading Indian research 
	institutes and universities. Discrimination<br>
	against Muslims does not appear to be the dominant cause. A professor at 
	Jamia told me that an overwhelming number of Muslim students were inclined 
	towards seeking easier (and more lucrative) professions in spite of special 
	incentives offered to them at his university. In general, Muslims in India 
	appear more modern and secular than in Pakistan. However, Hyderabad 
	astonished me. Is it a total exception? In the lecture that I gave at a 
	government women's college, there was only one young woman without a burqa 
	in an audience of about a hundred. These women were surprised to learn that 
	Pakistan - at least in most places - is more liberal than Hyderabad. The 
	extreme conservatism in the Muslim part of the city reminds one of Peshawar.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· There was a 
	remarkable lack of hostility towards Pakistan. Indeed a desire for friendly 
	relations was repeatedly expressed in every forum I went to. This is not to 
	be taken lightly: many of my public lectures were either about (or on) 
	science, but others dealt with deeply contentious issues - nuclear weapons, 
	India-Pakistan relations, and the Kashmir conflict. Various Indian peace 
	groups and NGOs organized public discussions and screenings of the two 
	documentaries that I had made (with my friend Zia Mian): &quot;Pakistan and India 
	under the Nuclear Shadow&quot;, and &quot;Crossing the Lines - Kashmir, Pakistan, 
	India&quot;. To be sure, my views on Indian policies and actions in Kashmir 
	occasionally provoked knee-jerk nationalistic responses and accusations of 
	pushing &quot;a Pakistani line&quot;. But these were infrequent and even heated 
	exchanges always remained within the bounds of civility.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Ignorance about 
	Pakistan is widespread. In most public gatherings, and certainly in every 
	school that I spoke at, people had never seen a Pakistani. A puzzled 12-year 
	old girl asked me: &quot;Sir, are you really a Pakistani?&quot;. Many Indians have a 
	misconception of Pakistan as a medieval, theocratic state. In fact, only a 
	few parts of Pakistan are really so. I also encountered the belief that 
	Pakistanis have been totally muzzled and live in a police state. This is 
	untrue - articles in the Pakistani press are often blunter and more critical 
	than in the Indian press. An Indian friend hypothesized that knowledge of 
	the other country is inversely proportional to the geographical distance 
	between our countries. Unfortunately this will remain true unless there is a 
	substantial exchange of visitors.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Indians are deeply 
	nationalistic and may dislike particular governments but they only rarely 
	criticize the Indian state. This is not difficult to understand: the 
	democratic process has given a strong sense of participation to most 
	citizens and has successfully forged a national identity (except in Kashmir, 
	and parts of the North East) that transcends the immense diversity of Indian 
	cultures. But this has an important downside: nationalism is easy to 
	mobilize and highly dangerous in matters of war and conflict. I found the 
	Indian elite (especially the former heads of nuclear, space, and technology 
	programs) condescending and irritatingly smug. Even if India has done well 
	in many respects, in most others it is still behind the rest of the world. 
	Fortunately, Pakistani intellectuals are less attached to their nation state 
	and therefore more forthright. The reason is rather clear: three decades of 
	military rule have dealt a serious blow to nation building and firming up 
	the Pakistani identity.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">· Similarities between 
	the two countries exceed the differences. Cities in both countries are 
	poisoned with thick car fumes and grid-locks are frequent; megaslums and 
	exploding populations threaten to swallow up the countryside; electricity 
	supplies are intermittent; and water is fast disappearing from rivers and 
	aquifers. The rural poor are fleeing to the cities, and wretched beggars 
	with amputated limbs are casually accepted as part of the urban scenery. 
	There is little long-term planning, and none at all for coping with the 
	inevitable changes that global warming will soon bring.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">India is upbeat about 
	its future and the feeling of optimism is palpable down to the lower middle 
	class. The steady improvement in educational quality and outreach, the 
	growth of social movements that keep excesses of power and authority in 
	check, and a sense of participation among people are among India's most 
	significant gains. But its problems are no less than its accomplishments. 
	Will India's poor be able to find a voice, get help in fighting 
	superstitions and notions of caste, and be spared the marginalization that 
	accompanies globalization? Will India's leadership have the wisdom to arrive
