	<span lang="EN-CA">On February 13, 2005 I joined a several hundreds of my 
	very sombre compatriots who braved a very chilly subzero temperature of 
	Toronto to stage a silent protest at city’s Danforth-Victoria Park area to 
	express solidarity with Mrs. Asma Kibria’s world wide appeal to our overseas 
	community. The protest was very unique in many ways, not because of its 
	unprecedented size, but the torment of distress was visible at every one’s 
	face. The protest attracted the attention a number of TV channels whose 
	correspondents were talking to cross sections of attendees. One of the TV 
	reporters was talking to a lady, who probably was in her mid forties, 
	standing by my side,&nbsp; She was asked to explain the purpose of the silent 
	protest, although scores of banners inscribing the demand to ‘<i>Bring</i>
	<i>Kibria’s Killers to justice</i>’ were visible all over the street. The 
	lady explained to the reporter, in perfect English, the reason of her coming 
	to the protest, stressing her assertion that Mr. Kibria was ‘one of our 
	finest politicians’, with her 12 years old son and the husband. Then came 
	the very natural question from the reporter, ‘<i>don’t you have the law to 
	punish the killer of an opposition member of the parliament and a former 
	minister’</i>? The lady responded immediately, ‘<i>yes, we have the law, 
	what we are demanding is the rule of law’. </i></span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">In the words of Justice (US supreme court) Felix 
	Frankfurter<i>, </i>“<i>Fragile as reason is and limited as law is as the 
	institutionalized medium of reason, that's all we have standing between us 
	and the tyranny of mere will and the cruelty of unbridled, undisciplined 
	feeling”.</i>&nbsp; If one looks at the current happenings in Bangladesh, bombs, 
	grenades and <i>crossfire</i> are the omni-present vocabularies. I could not 
	find the word <i>crossfire</i> in any of the legal dictionaries. The Random 
	House dictionary defines <i>crossfire</i> as “<i>lines of gun fire from two 
	or more positions or combatants crossing one another”. </i>In English 
	language, the victim of <i>crossfire</i> carries the connotation of an 
	innocent bystander who got caught in the conflicts between two warring 
	parties. Bangladesh is not in the midst of a declared or undeclared civil 
	war and as such does not contain two warring parties. It left us with the 
	fallacy of <i>crossfire</i> that requires firing from two combatant sides. 
	The constitution of the Republic is in full effect, where in even if the 
	President’s delivery of the ceremonial speech in the parliament is delayed 
	by a day for whatever exigency situation, is considered by its treasury 
	bench members as serious violation of the sacred document, which all of its 
	citizens is bound by oath and allegiance to defend. The very sacred document 
	clearly stipulates the fundamental right of its citizen by affirming in 
	Article 32, “<i><span style="color: maroon">No person shall be deprived of 
	life or personal liberty saves in accordance with law. </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Article 
	35 (3) goes further when it reaffirms, “<i>e<span style="color: maroon">very 
	person accused of a criminal offence shall have the right to a speedy and 
	public trial by an independent and impartial court or tribunal established 
	by law”. </span></i><span style="color: maroon">&nbsp;Our honourable law 
	minister, who, ironically, has the distinct honour of wilfully and 
	faithfully serving every despot who usurped the state power by unlawful 
	means, is justifying the killing in <i>crossfire</i> without any specific 
	reference to the law or ordinance that empowered the concerned law enforcing 
	organ of the state to carry out these extra-judicial killings. Absence of 
	capital punishment in many societies does not in any way reflect their 
	leniency towards the perpetrators of a crime, rather to give the <i>benefit 
	of doubt</i> to an irreversible phenomenon in case of a wrongful conviction. 
	The acquittal of a number self-confessed killers of the founding father of 
	our state by the court of law once again has proved that the ‘</span><i>cruelty 
	of unbridled, undisciplined feeling‘ </i>&nbsp;has no room in the thesaurus of 
	law.<i> </i></span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>
	<span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></i></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-CA">Today’s world is 
	a global village and the government, however it is constituted, of any 
	sovereign state has no absolute sovereignty to kill its own people. Amnesty 
	International is the most prominent watch dog body to monitor such gross 
	violation of the rule of law, whose reports and concerns are very dear to 
	our politicians when they are in the helpless side of the aisles. Its 
	present chief, who happens to be an icon of Bangladesh origin, only visited 
	Bangladesh on the other day to record, in absolute</span></font><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">
	</span><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-CA">term her, vehement opposition 
	to unabated killings in so-called <i>crossfire</i>. Also added in that choir 
	of protest was the voice of the luminary Asma Janangir, a highly respected 
	human right activist of the world. In the diplomatic arena, only on the 
	other day the head </span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #333333">of 
	Delegation of the European Commission in Bangladesh, Ambassador Esko 
	Kentrschynskyj termed the deaths in so-called <i>crossfire</i> as 
	extra-judicial killings and said,</span></font><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Verdana; color: #333333"> 
	“</span><font face="Verdana"><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #333333">those 
	killed in 'crossfire' were denied their right to justice and their human 
	rights, as they had not been tried. Such activities are contrary to good 
	governance and rule of law”.</span></i><span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #333333"> 
	In the domestic front, a large group of our eminent citizens, considered to 
	be the conscience of the nation’s soul, have issued a strongly worded 
	statement which mentioned among other things, “t<i>he constitution is being 
	flagrantly violated and the judicial system of the country is virtually on 
	'the brink of a breakdown' due to such 'ferocious' and 'fascist' acts 
	unleashed by the government. If such killings continue unabated, many in 
	future will dare to defy the constitution and the judicial system”</i>. And 
	then came the news of the donors’ meeting in Washington ‘at the behest of 
	Europeans concerned over deteriorating governance, rising lawlessness and a 
	fear of Islamist militants' uprising’.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #333333">In the backdrop of such 
	wide-spread criticisms over the lack of governance and the absence of the 
	rule of law, our honourable finance minister, who finds fault with everyone 
	but himself, squarely blamed the opposition politicians and the nation’s 
	news media for the harsh questions he had to face during his recent 
	encounter with the European Commissioners. The honourable minister’s 
	refutations were cheap shots and were not prudent and credible enough to 
	score any points in the arguments, let alone impressing the European 
	commissioners who did not have to be re-educated in the essence of the rule 
	of law. In the societies governed by the rule law, any extra-judicial 
	killing in the hand of a law enforcing authority is promptly investigated by 
	the Special Investigation Unit and the reports of its findings, either 
	indictment or acquittal, are public documents. Law enforcing agencies in 
	those societies are only accountable to the rule of law, order of the Prime 
	Minister or the President to arrest a suspected criminal has no place in its 
	domain of authority. Equating the recurring phenomenon of bomb blasts and 
	grenade attacks in Bangladesh and the subsequent failure of the law 
	enforcing authority to bring the perpetrators to justice, with those of 
	Spain, where the Basque separatist guerrilla war is in effect, and Ireland, 
	where a never ending civil war is on, reflected the sheer ignorance on the 
	part of the honourable minister.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #333333">Although politicians in our land 
	do not hold the exclusive right to hypocrisy, no where else it is probably 
	so much blatantly obvious as in Bangladesh. Ironically, the party which has 
	been ceaselessly exploiting the killing of Siraj Sikder in the hands of the 
	law enforcing authority some thirty years ago and demanding an investigation 
	only when it was in the opposition, is now approving the allegedly cold 
	blooded murder of his comrades and terming them as death in <i>crossfire.
	</i>The custodians of the law do not have the option to take refuge in the 
	ordinary citizens’ believed perception. In the words of Justice Catherine 
	Crier (of Texas), “</span><i><span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #510000">The 
	rule of law is not a popularity contest where the most likeable, most 
	articulate, or even the most repentant violator wins, and a sworn oath to 
	defend the constitution is not contingent upon the subject under 
	discussion”.</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #333333"> </span></i>
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #333333">Let me conclude by quoting the
	</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color: black">Lord Chief Justice Coke said 
	in the case of Proclamations (1610), &quot;<i>The King himself ought not to be
