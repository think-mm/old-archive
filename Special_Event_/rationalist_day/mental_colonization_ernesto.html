mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The greatest colonization is the colonization of the
  mind. In the initial stages of colonization, the conquered people are enslaved
  and controlled with the force of arms. The weakness of this form of
  colonization is that the colonized people can rise up in revolution and send
  the colonizer packing, permanently. This colonization is transient. However,
  the colonizer has other weapons in his arsenal and these are used to colonize
  the minds of the conquered people, since colonization of the mind has more
  permanency.<o:p>

  colonization. Specialized education and exposure to carefully controlled media
  are used to partially colonize the minds of the people. This is not a thing of
  the past and is still done with </span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">greater</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">
  vigour. The big guns for this colonization are the televisions, radios and
  newspapers and other forms of media – often this is called deculturisation
  by people labelled as conservative. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Entertainment, News, TV, and radio programs are
  slanted to allow the people to form the “desired” opinions and the
  “desired” prejudices. Primarily, however, it is education that is
  controlled. The media adds to the colonization by controlled education. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Books and curricula are chosen more or less by the
  existing powers (corporate, government, and religious) reflecting their
  wishes. Students learn what the “powers” wish them to learn. The choice of
  material for the student from which the student learns is pre-selected. The
  material which will enable the student to go beyond the classroom are also
  controlled either by subtly discouraging the student from going too far from
  what is taught in the classroom or it is controlled directly by making certain
  types of material more available than others and some simply unavailable. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">This affects the freedom of thought. Freedom of
  thought depends heavily on the diversity of knowledge and the control of
  education greatly curtails this freedom. Where the freedom of knowledge is
  controlled, freedom of thought is dead and thus freedom of speech becomes
  irrelevant. And democracy thus becomes a mere tool of the existing powers.<o:p>

  wearing the Lungi is considered unseemly. Even eating with forks and knives is
  often considered more “civilized” than eating with the hand, which is the
  Indian tradition. Many do not stop to think that eating utensils and many
  other customs of the west developed out of what their environment demanded.
  For people in colder climates eating with the hand meant washing it, which is
  not comfortable in their climate and as such, there was a necessity to invent
  eating utensils. This also goes for shoes that enclose the whole foot. Those
  kind of shoes are not necessary and rather uncomfortably hot in warm weather
  but today, Indians and many other warm climate inhabitants use the shoes where
  more stringy sandal-shoes would suffice. <o:p>

  Indian clothes but was an utter admirer and supporter of the British Raj. The
  attitude towards clothes and utensils represents the mindset of the still
  colonized Indians. Westernization (the culture of the colonizer) is seen as
  modern and more acceptable. Apparently, Macaulay was successful.<o:p>

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The ultimate weapon of colonization, a weapon far
  superior to any conventional weapon, exists in the arsenal of the colonizer
  – it is religion. One can rise above one’s education once one observes
  reality to be contrary to the teachings and may even see past the television
  and other media. However, it is much harder to reject religious teaching (for
  fear of punishment and for greed of reward) as religion suppresses one’s
  thinking faculties. Thus, the ultimate colonization of the mind is done by
  religion. Once this is done, mental colonization is complete and the people
  readily submit themselves to the colonizer. The colonizer may leave the
  country and allow nationalism but will still have a colony just as Macaulay
  said, “Indian in blood and colour but English in taste, in morals and in
  intellect&quot; and through such a class the British would perpetuate their
  rule”. <o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The mentally colonized individual even looks for his
  heritage in the land of the colonizer. They feel pride in the colonizers’
  history and glory. They hero-worship the very aggressors who parasitize their
  country like leeches as colonizers or in their most recent form –
  neo-colonialists. Still slaves just without chains!<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">A very tiny section of the colonized, usually those
  who were affluent before the arrival of the colonialists or those who were
  servants of the colonizer deal with the colonialist to achieve
  pseudo-independence and gain power, just as Marx said. Through these
  “educated” natives, the colonialists practice neo-colonialism, in which
  the wealth of the colonized nation still flows to the colonialists. This tiny
  group becomes the elite and extremely rich and powerful while the rest of the
  people fight each other, intoxicated by the scarcity principle, for the scraps
  that fall down the cracks of the system according to Reagan’s highly
  insulting “trickle down” theory. <o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Even the culture is gradually modified – and needs
  very little outside force. People abandon their own culture and traditions as
  they are taught to think that their culture and traditions are primitive and
  uncivilized or antireligious. A </span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">native</span></i></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">
  child who grows up in a Christian missionary school very often associates
  their parents and/or ancestors as misguided and leftover from an uncivilized
  world and embrace westernism freely. Even the language is modified as in East
  Bengali Bangla where certain Bangla words (like the word for water) are
  replaced with Urdu (Hindi dialect with a heavy dose of Arabic and Persian
  words) words, which are considered <i>more Islamic</i>.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">From the very birth, religion controls all the vital
  points on one’s life including one’s name, which is just the tip of the
  iceberg. When one reaches sexual maturity, one has to take refuge in religion,
  since religion controls one’s sexual freedom. One needs to get a licence
  from the priest to have sex – marriage. (Today, thankfully, one can avoid
  this – but still needs to get permission from the court in many countries.)
  Even at death, one has to pass through the hands of the priest. Ultimately,
  the colonization is done in such a way that for all the important things in
  life, one has to run to religion and the bosses of religion. The very way a
  person leads life is dictated by religion. By controlling the vital points,
  virtually a person’s entire being is controlled by the religion – loyalty
  of the individual to the bosses of the religion (the colonizer) is achieved.
  So undoubtedly, it is the ultimate colonizer.<o:p>

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">This ultimate colonization of the mind is symbolized
  by the conversion of faith AND choice of NAMES for children by parents. The
  parents, who stand in awe of the aggressor and search for heritage in the
  aggressor’s land, take names for their children from the names of the
  colonizers. Arabic and European (Biblical) names are the choice names in the
  different colonized nations depending on the faith. The colonizers recognize
  this very well. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">One might trivialize the use of foreign names.
  However, it is a bigger issue than one realizes. It does not only symbolize
  the loss of culture and ultimate colonization, it also has many consequences.
  A name is one of the most intimate possessions and control of the name has a

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">What is the need of names? When we want to learn
  about something or one, we need to distinguish and identify, hence comes the
  use of a name or in general terms, a label. The name one is given at birth or
  individual label controls how one is perceived in many ways and even how one
  views oneself. All Daves and all Toms are not the same, however, when the name
  indicates a certain type of origin, it immediately triggers prejudices. Arabic
  names indicate to us that a person is Muslim and Indian/Bengali names indicate
  that the person is probably Hindu. It affects both the person with the name
  and those around him. It moulds the world around a person. It encourages
  generalization. A person with a Bengali name will be perceived generally as a
  Hindu and the circle of friends around him will form partially filtered by
  that name. The outlook of the person born in an Islamic family with a Bengali
  name will be much different from that of one with an Arabic name.<o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Then there is a much more important issue – the
  confusion of name due to the generalization and prejudice has greater
  implications -- an extremely long-term effect of mental colonization. If a
  person with an Arabic name of Bengali origin does something wonderful and is
  noted worldwide, there is a great chance that he will be perceived as an Arab.
  This will create ambiguity and confusion... much more in the future than at
  present. In a thousand years, one might find the name and achievement of an
  individual and get a completely wrong idea about his heritage. Again, this
  shows the permanency of this type of colonization.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Ultimate colonization by conversion/imposition of
  religion starts in early childhood. Before the capability to use sense and
  logic is developed to discern the fallacies and absurdities of religious
  teachings, religion is honed into the mind of a child. A child’s primary
  sources of teaching (absolute) in this period are the parents who initiate the
  colonization process... infusing the child with a foreign doctrine as if it
  were a virus being transmitted. The parents, themselves, were infected by
  their parents – the virus of colonization is passed down the generations
  from parent to child. <o:p>
  </o:p>

  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">This colonization/belief is then strengthened by the
  priests, media and even schools as the child grows up. Ultimately the
  child’s faculties for thinking and discerning logic from illogic, is
  selectively paralyzed. On certain issues – religious issues or
  “patriotic” issues, the person will fail to “see” logic and reality.
  One is taught unthinking, obsessive and ostentatious practice of beliefs
  through sterile rituals -- religion. <o:p>

  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">This colonization also creates a hostility in the
  minds of individuals when beliefs run into conflict with reality or own
  inherent sense of logic. That is, when the individual is asked or some
  situation forces the individual to review a fundamental illogical belief, the
  individual feels stress and feels irrationally threatened. This conflict is
  often the cause of great religious intolerance.<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Today the colonization process has its own life and
  does not need any fixed colonizers. Colonized individuals feel duty bound to
  propagate the colonization process. Religion is the greatest self-propagating
  colonizing weapon, which again makes religion the ultimate weapon of
  colonization. Its great power facilitates mobilization the masses. The
  colonizer or other authority of religion can mobilize the unsuspecting masses
  even to go to war upon their bidding even if the war is unjustifiable. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Religion with the power of the media creates this
  zombie like effect where people kill and die for second hand beliefs and for
  scraps that fall from the table of the masters of the society. Individual
  minds are so colonized through the slanted media, selective education and the
  ultimate colonizer, religion that they are trained to be intellectually lazy.
  One would rather let someone else do their thinking and would just accept that
  someone else’s opinion as their own belief. In other words: ultimate and
  long lasting colonization. And so Einstein laments, “It is in most cases
  quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions
  and to make intelligent use of his political rights.”</o:p>
