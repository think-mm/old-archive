	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	I turned CNN on just as an everyday routine, before I moved on to other 
	channels, with the hope that I would update myself with today's news quickly 
	and then move on to something else. Suddenly I heard that the Georgia 
	School Board had initially decided to take the word "evolution" out of the 
	textbooks and replace this <i>controversial</i> word with the words 
	"biological changes." But at the end of the report, the person who was in 
	charge of making this change had to back up because of strong protest from 
	the scientific community. She apologized and said she was sorry that she 
	started a bigger controversy, when her intentions were to move away from the 
	initial controversy about evolution. I almost stopped breathing when I 
	started to listen to the news, and then I sighed when heard the end of it. I 
	was drowning in the waves of my thoughts, worrying about my seven-year old 
	daughter, who is already asking questions about creationism and religion 
	 versus atheism/freethinking/women's right etc. what would she learn from 
	these schools if this was how science was perceived here?</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"> This is not the first time this has happened in the 
	USA and the Western world, places the rest of the world looks up to for 
	scientific developments. Dr. Tim M. Berra, Professor of Zoology at the Ohio 
	State University, wrote a book called <i>Evolution and the Myth of 
	Creationism: A Basic Guide to the Facts in the Evolution Debate</i> The 
	book's purpose was to refute and protest the surge of non-scientific 
	material in the United States school board curricula. He stated his anger 
	and frustration in the preface of the book ... "I was originally drawn into 
	the evolution/creation controversy in 1982, when I reviewed a draft of the
	<i>Biology Curriculum Guide</i> of the Columbus, Ohio public schools. Until 
	then, I had shared the view of most scientists that the creationists were 
	not to be taken seriously. Just ignore them, and their demands will soon be 
	forgotten ... was the attitude of busy scientists who did not want to 
	interrupt their research to do battle with quaint notion of bygone age . . . 
	I was shocked to see that the <i>Biology Curriculum Guide</i>, a handbook 
	for high school biology teachers, was about fifty percent creationist. It 
	considered such fundamentalist Christian beliefs as that the Earth is only 
	few thousand years old to be a scientific equal of modern radiometric-dating 
	techniques. Along the way it trotted out the usual creationist 
	chestnuts--misrepresentation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, distortion 
	of fossil records, the claim of worldwide flooding, and many examples of 
	anti-science--passing them all off as science. That was when I realized that 
	education is in trouble! It was clear that the strategy of ignoring the 
	creationists would work to the detriment of both science and society." </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           I had heated discussions with many of my 
	friends from the scientific and progressive communities, who had so many 
	misconceptions about evolution, Darwinism, and scientific advancements in 
	these fields. They tried to portray the limitations of Darwin's theory and 
	the new findings in this area as a strong support for creationism. Because 
	Einstein was wrong about the Uncertainty Principal of Heisenberg, however, 
	that did not prove that the whole discipline of quantum physics was wrong. 
	 Because Darwin had limitations in his theory of evolution, which he 
	proposed almost 140 years ago, it does not prove that the scientific 
	approach to the evolution of all living creatures in this world has been 
	proven wrong, and that creationism has won. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">Religion is based on sheer 
	belief; it does not have any scientific basis. Religious people's 
	interpretations are not subject to experimentation, revision or 
	falsification. According to religion, the only way one can know the truth 
	is for God to tell him/her what it is. Whatever contradicts the holy 
	scriptures has to be wrong, in their view. The theory of evolution, on the 
	other hand, is based on a scientific approach. It has been going through 
	experimentation, modifications, and expansions every day with the speed of 
	light, as science progresses.. Science does not rest on beliefs; it is a 
	self-correcting endeavor. Science depends on hypotheses, tests, logic, 
	proofs, and the rationality of a proposed hypothesis or theory. If evolution 
	gets proven wrong by critical new data, scientists would be the first ones 
	to discard it and move on to the new research for the sake of their own 
	careers.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           The scientific community has undoubtedly 
	accepted the theory of the evolution of life. This is the foundation of the 
	biological sciences. Think about it for a moment; Darwin did not have 
	abundant information on geological longevities of fossil records, and had no 
	idea about genetics when he proposed this evolutionary theory. The more 
	advancement have been made in the area of Geology, radioactive dating 
	technology, paleontology (scientific study of fossils), microbiology, and 
	genetics, the more concrete are the records that have been piled up that 
	support of theory of evolution. Darwin was far ahead of his time. But there 
	are  many disagreements and hypotheses about how this evolution takes 
	place. Today one of the most debated topics is Darwin's natural selection, 
	which upholds the gradual evolution of species. Scientists differ greatly 
	about this notion. While debates and experiments heat up among the 
	scientific community around the tempo of evolutionary change, one thing has 
	been proven to be certain: <b>Darwin</b> <b>was absolutely right about 
	evolution</b>.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           Before I get into a more detailed 
	discussion on Darwin's theory of evolution and how it has evolved in almost 
	one and a half centuries, and how his book <i>On the Origin of Species by 
	Natural Selection</i> first shook the world in 1859, let me explain some of 
	the scientific terminologies that I will use throughout the discussion. 
	Darwin noted that every individual within a species was unique (<b>Species</b> 
	are basic units of life; a species is a group of animals or plants that is 
	 capable of breeding successfully with each other), and that no two 
	individuals were exactly alike, except for rare examples of identical twins 
	in nature. He explains that there is immense variation in Nature; its 
	reproductive capacity is far greater than the real population size. Darwin 
	concludes that there is competition in nature for resources that 
	overproduction of offspring is the rule for nature, and that only favorable 
	variations get to survive and flourish and the unfavorable ones die out. 
	Darwin called this process <b>natural selection, </b>and stated that, as a 
	result of natural selection, biological <b>evolution </b> occurred<b>. (</b>Interestingly 
	enough, Darwin never mentioned two things in his writings that he gets so 
	much credit for from supporters and critics alike: one is the 
	word"evolution," and the other is the phrase"survival of the fittest". 
	According to Darwin this natural selection is a very slow and gradual 
	process and gets reflected in <b> adaptation. </b>Organisms get adapted and 
	fine tuned for survival through their environments..</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           As I have mentioned before, Darwin proposed 
	his theory of evolution without the help of genetics, and with limited 
	knowledge of fossil records. As these two disciplines started to grow in the 
	beginning of 1900s, Darwin's theory of evolution got reaffirmed on the basis 
	of strong scientific data. Gregor Mendel's discovery of genes (units of 
	heredity within a cell) resolved many of the problems Darwin was having 
	with inheritance. Mendel's study showed that all traits are inherited by the 
	random combination of genes coming from each parent though they never get 
	blended, but that their effects are sometimes diluted by other genetic 
	traits. Some genetic variants adapt better to their existing natural 
	environment and survive until maturity, leaving enough offspring to carry 
	their genes. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">On the other hand, the less 
	well-adapted variants die out, leave fewer offspring, and gradually 
	disappear from nature. As a result, the frequency of the occurrence of 
	certain genes changes over time. In summary, <b>evolution is a change of 
	gene frequency brought about by natural selection and other processes</b> <b>
	acting upon the variations produced by sexual reproduction, mutation and 
	other mechanisms</b>. The environment is the selecting agent, and because 
	the environment changes over time and from one region to another, different 
	variants will be selected under different environmental conditions.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"> To understand it better, 
	let's consider this example from our everyday life.. Why do doctors always 
	insist on completing the dose of an antibiotic when you get sick? After a 
	few days of the drug you do feel better, because the antibiotic has killed 
	 most of the susceptible bacteria. But you still have only those bacteria 
	left in your system which are more resistant to the drug. If you quit 
	taking the antibiotic at this point, only these more resistant bacteria will 
	produce their next generation of offspring with a much more resistant gene 
	pool. In a few days you could feel much sicker, and be infected with a much 
	more resistant group of bacteria. You would need a much stronger medicine to 
	destroy them. What happened there would be that more drug resistant 
	bacteria were selected for survival. Antibiotics did not make the bacteria 
	 more resistant; they  just created an environment which encouraged the 
	micro-evolutionary shift towards a new strain.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           Darwin only focused on adaptive causes and 
	natural selection. Though he suspected the existence of other non-adaptive 
	changes, he did not have the opportunity to appreciate it in the light of 
	modern genetics. Gradual natural selection is the primary force causing 
	 evolutionary changes, but it is not the only force. As modern genetics 
	came into play in between the 1900s and the1920s, scientists started to 
	discover that chance fluctuation in gene frequencies could yield some net 
	changes. Genes are chemical structures, and sudden, accidental heritable 
	modification through chemical changes in gene is called <b>mutation</b>. 
	Mutation can occur more than once, and it can disrupt or change the 
	character of a population even before it has gone through the process of 
	natural selection. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Very prominent biologists like William Bateson, Hugo de 
	Vries, and T.H Morgan argued that unusual mutants explained the immediate 
	mode of change in nature, and that this was more tangible and self 
	explanatory than the Darwinian selection mechanism. They concluded that the 
	accumulation of many mutations resulted in the biological evolution of 
	life. It became widely accepted that new species evolved from 
	macromutations, not from a gradual process of natural selection leading to 
	evolution. Darwinism appeared to be dead.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           In the meantime, advancement in the modern 
	synthesis of evolution and population genetics started to get serious 
	attention in the field of modern genetics. Changes in gene frequency could 
	be calculated mathematically. Now we know genes are arranged in a linear 
	fashion on chromosomes composed of DNA, and of protein which resides in the 
	nuclei of animal or plant cells. Sudden or accidental macromutation cannot 
	create a species instantly; it can only create random variability in small 
	degrees. Only occasional and small mutations can be valuable to nature and 
	improve adaptation. The theory of macromutation as the primary force of 
	evolution got discarded, though it found an important place in new 
	evolutionary genetics.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           Modern synthesis reaffirmed Darwin's 
	gradualistic evolution theory. Dr. Dobzhansky was the pioneer of this new 
	re-affirmation of gradual evolution. His intense experiment with fruit flies 
	(Drosophila) showed that seasonal genetic alterations occur due to the 
	changing environment, proving natural selection. He wrote in 1947, 
	"Controlled experiments can now take the place of speculation ... The 
	mechanics of natural selection in concrete cases can be studied. Hence the 
	genesis of adaptation, which is possibly the central problem of biology, now 
	lies within the reach of the experimental method." Through modern synthesis 
	and the development of quantitative population genetics, evolutionary 
	biology entered a new era. It was elevated from speculation to experimental 
	science embedded in to mathematical calculation, just like physics and 
	chemistry.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           Darwin's gradual and slow selection process 
	works perfectly on large populations, as the accidental genetic changes even 
	out at the end. But in the case of small populations, <b>genetic drift </b>
	(random changes in gene frequency by accidental or chance occurrences) plays 
	the most important role. Natural selection does not work in cases of small 
	populations as it does in large populations. A similar phenomenon can be 
	observed in case of the <b>founder principle </b>as well. For example, a 
	self-fertilizing black snail gets blown out to a small island where no other 
	snail is available, and it produces lots of black snails by self 
	fertilization. Now the new colony of snails will have a very different gene 
	frequency as the parent snail brought an incomplete sample of genes from the 
	original gene pool. This change will occur due to chance, not because of 
	natural selection. These are all examples of non-adaptive selection that 
	Darwin did not cover in his findings.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           Discovery of the most famous transitional 
	fossil, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, has been a major triumph for the supporters of 
	gradualist evolution theory. T.H. Huxley showed very clearly that this was 
	an intermediate between small dinosaurs and birds. It had the skeleton of a 
	dinosaur and the feathers of a bird. It might not be the ancestor of modern 
	birds, but it shows the clear transition from reptile to birds. As <b>
	radiometric dating</b> technique developed later, we started to get more and 
	more evidence supporting evolution. We can now determine the absolute age of 
	ancient rocks and the fossils embedded in them. . The oldest fossils of 
	bacteria and algae date back 3.5 billion years. We find better and more 
	developed forms of life as the layers of rocks get younger and younger. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">This sequential appearance of 
	more advanced life forms in different layers of rocks only confirms 
	Darwin's theory of evolution.. On the other hand, fossil records also 
	contradict Darwin's gradual and stepwise changes as the principle mechanism 
	of evolution. Fossil records clearly show that there are lengthy periods of 
	very little change, and then suddenly we see very rapid changes again 
	followed by very slow changes. This has been a major area of research in the 
	field of recent evolutionary biology. Many new theories have emerged to 
	explain this gap. First Ernest Mayr and then paleontologists Niles Eldredge 
	and Stephen J. Gould have suggested that some species have evolved rapidly, 
	going through a sudden burst of relatively rapid evolution diverging quickly 
	from its ancestral species. This theory has been known as <b>punctuated 
	equilibrium, and</b> seems to contradict with Darwin's gradual evolution. 
	The supporters of this theory point towards the fossil records where we can 
	find abrupt appearances of new species or abrupt disappearances of 
	 existing species. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">Richard Dawkins has opposed 
	this theory by pointing out that it could have resulted from migration into 
	an area. Dr. T. Berra states,"Punctuated equilibrium is really just 
	accelerated gradualism. The punctuated equilibrium proponents compress 
	gradual changes into brief episodes. Gradual change means that the 
	descendants are only slightly different from their ancestors. Even though 
	there might be geological brief bursts of evolution followed by long periods 
	of no change, the change that occurs is still gradual, or stepwise." Dr. S.M. 
	Stanley says,"Some workers assumed that the punctuational view virtually 
	denied evolution within established species; conversely, they assumed that 
	the gradualistic view saw speciation as almost never being rapidly 
	divergent. Because it then seemed evident that the truth lay on the middle 
	ground, the controversy seemed meaningless and misleading ... As I have noted 
	the biggest problem, the sudden rise of flowering plants--Darwin's 
	'abominable mystery'-- has been resolved by new fossil evidence. We now have 
	fossils documenting a pattern of early adaptive radiation. Here we have a 
	prime example of how the concept of evolution has been strengthened rather 
	than weakened since the time of evolution." </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">           So we see that, though this very 
	contradictory evolution theory has gone through brutal refutation and 
	challenges, it has gotten stronger every day  because of new developments 
	in science. All these new theories have only strengthened the concept of 
	evolution. The theory of evolution has stood the test of time, though the 
	mechanisms and tempo of evolution have constantly been debated. We have seen 
	immense hatred and fear towards this theory from the creationists. Maybe 
	history is repeating itself--when Copernicus proposed that the earth was not 
	the center of the universe, the Roman Catholic church considered it to be 
	 blasphemy. It took hundreds of years before everybody agreed to accept this 
	simple scientific fact that the earth was moving around the sun with all 
	other planets. This time Darwin has displaced the human species from center 
	stage, where human beings have thought themselves to be the best 
	creatures, created by a divine force. It will very understandably take a 
	while before we can swallow this immense shock and embrace the scientific 
	fact of evolution<b>.      
	                                                                       </b>
