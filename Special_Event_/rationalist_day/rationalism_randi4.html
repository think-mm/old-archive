    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000FF">Sina’s three guesses regarding
    my trick – the one he quoted – were quite wrong. In order to show that
    he has no knowledge of conjuring techniques, I’ll reveal the modus here.
    Now, I don’t expect Sina to have conjuring/mentalism expertise, but at
    least he should admit to that lack, rather than assuming that he can figure
    out these puzzles just by considering that ordinary factors apply. They don’t.
    There are aspects about which he could not know, but which supply the data
    that show how I knew what I did – not through psychic powers, but through
    reason and deception. Read on.<font face="Albertus Medium"><span style="font-family: Albertus Medium">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000FF">The tickets to the theater where
    I appeared, were being sold weeks before the show, only at the box office
    and door-to-door, and the seats were assigned by row and number. &nbsp;My
    very presentable confederate, Terry Lawson, who was two years older than I,
    was the one got me the contract for the performance. And, he had been around
    selling tickets for the charity, to likely donors. He had a car, which I did
    not. He had waited around the lobby of the theater and observed
    ticket-buyers coming in, trying to get some advance information on those who
    would attend, but it was two of the tickets he himself had sold in the
    neighborhood, that really served us well. That pair of tickets went to an
    elderly lady, seats on the aisle, in the third row.&nbsp;So we now knew
    where she would be sitting and what she looked like.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000FF">The next day, carrying a
    briefcase, Terry went to her neighborhood and began knocking on doors acting
    as a college student who was doing a survey of political opinions for a
    research paper at the University of Toronto, for which he presented proper
    student identification. (In those days, this was much more common than it
    would be today, and he had good response to his asking for interviews.) At
    the home of the lady living next door to the ticket-buyer, he casually asked
    about the name of the ticket-buyer. The neighbor obliged, and commented, “We
    call her, Rose.” I recall that she was a Mrs. Leslie.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000FF">When he then went to Mrs. Leslie’s
    door, he knocked and of course recognized the lady when she answered. He
    told her about his need for an interview, and was admitted to the living
    room, where she offered him tea, and he began asking her the list of
    questions he had. He also noted that she had an antique porcelain clock on
    the mantel above the fireplace, and the hands were dislodged, lying at the
    bottom of the face behind the glass covering “crystal.” There were three
    roses painted on the face. He observed that the &quot;rose&quot; theme was
    everywhere, and an embroidered &quot;sampler&quot; was framed by the door,
    with the woman's full name on it.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000FF">The rest should be very clear. I
    must add that Terry and I made sure to contact Mrs. Leslie later, to inform
    her of the trick and how it was done. She was highly entertained with the
    explanation, and grateful for our caring to tell her.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000FF">As another, very brief, example
    of this technique at work, I’ll describe this: at that same performance, I
    was in a toilet stall when two young fellows entered the room and got into
    conversation while using the facilities. They obviously weren’t aware that
    anyone might be listening, and spoke about a used automobile that one of
    them was considering buying. They gave details about model, color, and
    condition of the vehicle. And at one point, one of them called the other by
    name. I peeked out from under the stall and saw that one of them was wearing
    sneakers of two different colors, one red and the other green. They never
    saw me, nor knew that their conversation had been overheard. Just before my
    performance, I saw that distinctively-shoed man going upstairs to the
    balcony. I followed him a bit, and saw him take his seat in the very back
    row. During my performance, I pointed up to that man in the balcony, called
    him by name, and referred to the car, advising him to have the transmission
    examined carefully, and mentioning the color as well. He was astonished,
    especially when I asked him, “Where’s the other green shoe?” I could
    not possibly have seen his shoes from where I was on the stage. &nbsp;He
    slipped off his sneakers, held them up and showed them to the audience, who
    were very impressed with my mental “powers.”</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#0000FF">I did not reach these two fellows
    to explain my trick, but I’m sure they weren’t harmed by my deception. I
    could tell you much more, but I’ve not the time to further pursue these
    matters in this forum, I regret.</font></p>
