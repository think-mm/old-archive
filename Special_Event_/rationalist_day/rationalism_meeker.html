    <p>Ali Sina reminds us that one cannot be both a rationalist and dogmatic<br>
    at the same time. We are finite beings and there is much we don't<br>
    know. It is one of the most distinctive characteristics of science<br>
    that all theories are held provisionally. Sina notes the contrast<br>
    between this and religious and political doctrines that are<br>
    held to be beyond criticism and revision. But he presents a false<br>
    dichotomy between dogmatism and rationalism - as though one can be<br>
    rational simply by not being dogmatic.</p>
    <p>He begins with a dictionary defintion of dogma. But only writes about<br>
    about dogmatism; the attitude toward dogma, not it's content. In<br>
    that case he should have started with a definiton of dogamtism; Like<br>
    this one from Dagobert Runes, &quot;Dictionary of Philosophy&quot;:</p>
    <p>Dogmatism: A term used by many and various philosophers to<br>
    characterise their opponents' view more or less derogatorily.</p>
    <p>And this is clearly how Sina uses it.</p>
    <p>He tells of how he saw a globe<br>
    of orange light near hovering over his sleeping sister and how the<br>
    globe zoomed away out the window and disappeared. He then calls his<br>
    friend dogmatic because his friend cautions agains jumping to a<br>
    paranormal explanation of this phenomena. Plainly Sina wants to<br>
    believe it is paranormal, i.e. beyond explanation by known science.<br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>But is it? He apparently did not even seek a scientific explanation.<br>
    Like those religionists he mocks for belief based on miracles,<br>
    his mind is already made up. Had he spent even a few minutes<br>
    searching the literature he would have found that a globe of orange<br>
    light is what ball lightning looks like. It often moves swiftly<br>
    after hovering. It emits a sizzling sound which could have caused<br>
    his sister to have a bad dream.</p>
    <p>So is this the correct explanation of his experience? I don't know.<br>
    It could have been something else - like little green men in a kind<br>
    of space craft. But the point is that Sina doesn't have any reason to<br>
    jump to the conclusion that it was paranormal. And given that it<br>
    could have been just ball lightning there's no reason at all to<br>
    assume a paranormal &quot;explanation&quot;. I put &quot;explanation&quot;
    in quotes,<br>
    because without some theory about the paranormal, it isn't really an<br>
    explanation at all. It is just saying, &quot;I don't know what it was -<br>
    but science can't explain it.&quot;</p>
    <p>Sina's other example of James Van Praagh's performance on Larry King's<br>
    TV program is further evidence of his devotion to paranormal<br>
    explanations. Van Praagh's answers to questions by phonecallers were<br>
    vague and often wrong. Nothing in the least impressive. But which<br>
    reading was so specific that Sina &quot;cannot dismiss this as<br>
    coincidence.&quot; Why it was telling the host, Larry King, that his<br>
    father died in a factory! I don't dismiss this as coincidence<br>
    either. Since Van Praagh knew he was going to be on TV and he knew<br>
    he was going to be with Larry King - well he'd have to be pretty<br>
    stupid not to dig up some bit of information about Larry King.</p>
    <p>Sina may suppose there are ghosts that speak to James Van Praagh in<br>
    platitudes, but being rational means proportioning your degree of<br>
    belief to the evidence - all the evidence. All the evidence includes<br>
    the fact that Van Praagh never gets any useful information from 'the<br>
    other side'; that Harry Houdini, who said he'd communicate from<br>
    beyond the grave if possible, never did; that all evidence points to<br>
    the mind and spirit as being dependent on the physical function of<br>
    the brain. That doesn't absolutely rule out spirits, scientific<br>
    knowledge is always provisional, but it makes it infinitely more<br>
    likely that Van Praagh researched Larry King biography than that he<br>
    communicated with Larry's dead father.</p>
    <p>Sina apparently accepts as effacious any medical procedures that
    &quot;have<br>
    gained respectability and are practiced in many hospitals&quot;. Even<br>
    though some of them, e.g homeopathy, could only be effective if most<br>
    of<br>
    what we know about physics, chemistry, and biology were wrong.<br>
    Homeophaty has never been shown to be effacious in a clinical trial.<br>
    Perhaps Sina should recall that before the use of clinical trials was<br>
    common, that snake oil was a respectable remedy and blood letting was<br>
    practiced in many hospitals.</p>
    <p>Sina says, &quot;Let doubt guide our way.&quot; He is certainly a
    rationalist<br>
    in the narrow philosophical sense. He thinks that simply reasoning<br>
    is enough. If we find it logically possible to doubt science and to<br>
    believe in a paranormal beyond science he thinks we have done all<br>
    that is necessary to be 'rational'. But, what we celebrate today<br>
    is not the narrow rationalism of the school masters. It is<br>
    scientific rationalism. Its motto is, &quot;When in doubt, find out.&quot;</p>
    <p>The scientist doesn't simply suppose that some phenomena is beyond<br>
    science because he has no explanation. He investigates the<br>
    phenomena. He experiments. He measures. Sina ridicules James Randi<br>
    for offering a million dollars to anyone who can prove a paranormal<br>
    claim &quot;scientifically&quot;. He interposes the qualifier<br>
    &quot;scientifically&quot;, which is not in Randi's challenge, as though it<br>
    were some special, unreasonable critereon. There is no special<br>
    scientific proof. Science is just common sense writ large. If you<br>
    say you can find water with dowsing rods, then let's see you do it.<br>
    If you say you can bend spoons by mental power alone, let's test the<br>
    claim. Randi does not ask the claimant to use a measuring tape or a<br>
    thermometer. He only ask's them to show they can do what they claim<br>
    by whatever means they chose.</p>
    <p>Sina would apparently have us credulously accept charlatans and<br>
    mystery mongers and genuflect to the paranormal while chanting<br>
    &quot;Beyond Science!&quot; over and over. When scientific explanation is
    not<br>
    available that's a good reason to say, &quot;I don't know&quot;. It's not a<br>
    reason to say, &quot;That's paranormal and beyond scientific
    explanation.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>The opposite of dogmatic denial isn't rationality; it's uncritical<br>
    credulity.</p>
