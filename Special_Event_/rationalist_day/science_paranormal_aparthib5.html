  <p>Re: <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina40323.htm">http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina40323.htm</a>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Ali Sina is trying to pidgeon hole me into a vague definition of 
  materialism and creating a false dichotomy between materialism and 
  spiritualism, as if I have to subscribe to either or. First of all 
  spiritualism itself is a vague concept, lacking a precise logical definition. 
  So this dichotomy between materialism and spiritualism is flawed to be begin 
  with. Secondly the definition of materialism itself is either vague or can be 
  too broad to be able use such definition meaningfully in a debate where precise 
  meaning of terms are crucial. By debating on semantics we have entered the 
  realm of professional philosophical debate, so it is not proper to quote 
  dictionary definition of terms to base the debate on. When trying to 
  pidgeon hole anyone into any &quot;ism&quot;, it must be ensured that the &quot;ism&quot; is 
  defined precisely. For a rationalist, I contend that there is no need for any 
  &quot;ism&quot;. Science, logic and evidence is the only guiding principle for a 
  rationalist. Anyway if we have to settle the issue of who is a materialist, 
  first I must mention that most of the definitions of materialism are either 
  vague, lacking a logically precise definition that can meet today's strict 
  criterion for a rationalist, based on scientific insight. Let me now offer a 
  precise definition of materialism and then try to convince Ali Sina that by 
  that definition I am not a materialist, neither is Ali Sina, but Paul Edwards 
  is. But there is still a fundamental difference between Ali Sina and myself 
  even though we both are not materialist, according to my precise definition. 
  The end is to precisely point out the difference between myself, Sina and Paul 
  Edwards, and as a means to that end, a precise definition of materialism is in 
  order. A vague dictionary definition of materialism cannot draw that fine 
  distinction between the three of us. For this I have to rely on my other 
  articles where I introduced the fundamental unknown of the universe, the &quot;?&quot;. 
  I am giving the links to two article again where I have introduced in a 
  symbolic way the ultimate &quot;?&quot; : </p>
  <p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/13265">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/13265</a>&nbsp; (A SCIENTIFIC LOOK 
  AT LIFE, DEATH &amp; IMMORTALITY), </p>
  <p>and, </p>
  <p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/6557">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/6557</a>&nbsp; (A guide to debating 
  religious issues) </p>
  <p>Basically the premise is that the entire OBSERVABLE universe is explainable 
  (in principle, much is already explained, by OCCAM's razor and inductive 
  arguments, the remaining unexplained links of the chain of explanation can be 
  assumed to be explainable with further scientific insight) by the laws of 
  Physics (Including Life, Consciousness, love, altruism, stars, galaxies..). The 
  &quot;?&quot; is the unknown cause (If there is any, we don't know if there is) for the 
  laws of Physics. This is a true mystery for there is no theory yet to explain 
  the existence of the laws of physics by yet another law (Physics cannot 
  explain itself, just like Euclid's theorem cannot be used to derive Euclid's 
  theorem). </p>
  <p>Having introduced the ultimate mystery &quot;?&quot;, the three possible view one 
  can take regarding the &quot;?&quot; is : </p>
  <p>1. The view that &quot;?&quot; = NULL. </p>
  <p>Implication: The laws of Physics are uncreated, the ultimate cause of the 
  universe (i.e the buck for creating the universe stops at the laws of Physics, 
  there is no higher level of causation above the laws of Physics) </p>
  <p>Note: This is a BELIEF because we cannot justify this view by logic or 
  evidence. </p>
  <p>2. &quot;?&quot; = God/Spiritual force/Cosmic Force.. </p>
  <p>Note: This is also a belief, and moreover the belief also assumes a a 
  particular nature (Or tries to ascribe a nature) of the &quot;?&quot; by giving special 
  names to it (&quot;God&quot;, &quot;Spiritual Force etc&quot;). Finally the words &quot;God/Spiritual 
  Force/Cosmic Force&quot; are not amenable to a logically precise definition, which 
  is also free of any circularity, logical fallacy etc. The use of such words at 
  best reflect a certain instinctive sense or feeling. </p>
  <p>3. The view that &quot;?&quot; = NOT NULL </p>
  <p>This is also a belief, but the difference between this and the view in (2) 
  above is that no words are being used to describe the &quot;?&quot;, i.e the nature of 
  &quot;?&quot; is left wide open, admitting a complete ignorance about it (Except to 
  require that it cannot be NULL). </p>
  <p>4. The view that it is not known whether &quot;?&quot; is NULL or NON-NULL. So the 
  adherents of this view refuse to commit to any speculation at all regarding 
  either the existence or nature of &quot;?&quot;, unlike the adherents of views 1, 2, and 
  3 above where some commitment is made to venture a speculation as to the 
  existence and/or nature of &quot;?&quot; </p>
  <p>Now where does materialism fits into all these?. I define materialists as 
  adherents of only view (1). So adherents of (2)-(4) are not materialists. 
  Adherents of (2) can be called &quot;spiritualists&quot;, although such view is 
  logically imprecise because of the lack of a precise defintion of &quot;God&quot;, 
  &quot;Spiritual Force&quot;.. etc. Adherents of view (3) are known as &quot;Platonists&quot; in 
  philosophical jargon. ADHERENTS OF (4) ARE KNOWN AS NONCOGNTIVISTS. 
  Rationalism forces one to take the view of a noncognitivist, since an apriori 
  belief of any sort (All the views 1-3 resort to some belief) is not consistent 
  with rationalism, this is the view that I take, consequently. I cannot 
  overemphasize the significance of noncognitivism. As a general term this refer 
  to the impossibility or meaninglessness of claiming knowledge about an 
  issue/object. There are times when acknowledging complete ignorance is the 
  most rational thing to do. Silence is golden truly applies in such situation. 
  Remember that Rationalists are forced to utter the words &quot;God&quot;, 
  &quot;spirituality&quot;, only because those terms were invented and foisted off to the 
  general vocabulary, by those who hold views (2) and possibly (3), for whom 
  &quot;God&quot; would be a metaphorical term to mean a first cause for the creation of 
  laws of Physics. If theists never introduced those words, a strict rationalist 
  would never have used/thought of those words to begin with. I must emphasize 
  that the difference between (1) and (2) is non-trivial. View (3) leaves the 
  ultimate cause of existence open, creating ample room for a sense of awe and 
  mystery. View (1), that of a materialist, does not leave any room for such 
  sense of awe and mystery. I certainly do not belong to that camp. To me the 
  fact that there IS a universe, rather than not, IS a profound mystery. But I 
  would not rush into a &quot;just so&quot; theory to explain that mystery as the 
  adherents of views (1)-(3) purport to do. I have tried to adhere to the style 
  of professional philosophers in defining and phrasing terms and expressions. 
  Please see the following links for a professional philosopher's discussion on 
  noncognitivism, impossibility of a logically consistent definition of God etc 
  in conjunction with my discussion above to help understand the logic 
  precisely. </p>
  <p>I think Ali Sina takes the view of (2). Paul Edwards takes view (1). But I 
  leave it up to them to tell us where they fit in into the above scheme. </p>
  <p>Now to Ali Sina's response. Capitalized words indicate emphasis. Ali Sina 
  engaged in straw man fallacy (putting words in my mouth) quite often. The 
  following are examples of strawman because I didn't make those exact 
  statements. </p>
  <p>For Examples he said: </p>
  <p>1. &quot;You kept saying it is not observable and hence it is impossible&quot; </p>
  <p>(I never made the connection &quot;not observable ---&gt; impossible&quot;) </p>
  <p>2. &quot;So if you are certain that soul and God do not exist just because you 
  can't define them that&quot; </p>
  <p>(I never phrased it that way anywhere, linking existence with 
  nondefinability) </p>
  <p>I would request Ali Sina to quote me exactly and offer a line by line 
  refutation. Paraphrasing others' statements is dangerous when the debate 
  becomes a hairsplitting one on precise meaning of terms and statements. </p>
  <p>Now Ali Sina mentioned Martian figure as an example of something not 
  &quot;well-defined&quot; yet not dismissed by science either. He grossly misunderstood 
  what I meant &quot;not well-defined&quot;. From the context it was foolproof to 
  understand that I was referring to not well-defined LOGICALLY, i.e the concept 
  itself being not definable logically. Martiam face was an appearance on the 
  surface. Nothing logically ill-defined about it. We see marks, scratches, 
  figures on clouds all the time. </p>
  <p>SINA: &quot;a person may have suicidal thoughts. It may not be clear why this 
  individual has such thoughts. That does not mean science will disregard that 
  because it has no explanation for it.&quot; </p>
  <p>APARTHIB: A red herring. Suicidal thoughts are not logically ill-defined 
  CONCEPT, because it is a sense perception, like feeling hot or cold etc. And I 
  never stated that Science disregards that because it has no explanation for 
  it.&quot;. Such misquoting, wrong paraphrasing, i.e strawman fallacy is seriously 
  undermining your integrity in logical discourse. Science tries to explain 
  things that has no explanation until there is one. It never gives up. 
  Feelings, emotions are the subject of the New Science of Evolutionary 
  Psychology. Please do yourself a great favor by reading the Book &quot;Why We 
  Feel: The Science of Emotions&quot; by Victor Johnston. </p>
  <p>SINA: Do you have any convincing evidence that soul does not exist? 
  &quot;No-one-has-been-able-to-prove-it-yet&quot; is not an answer </p>
  <p>APARTHIB: By now you should be familiar with some common logical fallacies 
  to appreciate the fallacy you have committed above. It is a fallacy of 
  loaded/complex question. I don't even acknowledge that there exists a 
  consistent definition of soul to even TALK about &quot;it's&quot; existence or not. 
  Besides if you have done some basic reading in logical fallacies then you 
  would realize that &quot;proving that something does not exists&quot; is not a valid 
  logical process. Proving a universal negative is logically impossible. Rather 
  the burden is on those who claims that something exists to prove that it 
  exists. Asking the reverse is also known as shifting the burden of proof 
  fallacy. This may be first time you are hearing about this fallacy, but better 
  late than never. </p>
  <p>SINA: So if you are certain that soul and God do not exist just because you 
  can't define them that belief is based on ignorance </p>
  <p>APARTHIB: </p>
  <p>Again a misquote/straw man fallacy. I never stated anywhere that Soul or 
  God DOES NOT exist BECAUSE they cannot be defined. I said clearly that we 
  cannot TALK about the existence or nonexistence of logically ill-defined 
  notions like God, Soul. Are they same thing to you? Then I will be concerned 
  as to your competence in tackling the sophistry of shrewd religious 
  apologists. </p>
  <p>SINA: Take the example of motherly instinct or other instincts that are 
  also laws without which animals would be able to procreate or survive. In 
  human kingdom all laws governing the physical world, the plant and the animal 
  world apply but there are laws that are uniquely tailored for humans. Take the 
  example of altruistic love. Only humans are capable of endangering their own 
  lives to save someone else's, especially if that someone else is a stranger. 
  Justice, compassion, love, etc. are natural laws that apply to humans only.
  </p>
  <p>APARTHIB: Your view above is reflective of your unfamiliarity with the 
  field of &quot;Evolutionary Psychology&quot;, a branch of science (Biology). Altruism, 
  love, agresion all emotions are now pretty well-understood in terms of 
  evolutionary adaptation. The book by Victor Johnston or many other books on 
  &quot;Evolutionary Psychology&quot; will give you that insight. Feelings and emotions 
  are not outside of the known scientific laws. Also there is no abrupt 
  transition in some emotions being only present in humans, and absent in other 
  animals. Modern biological studies show a rather continuous transition, many 
  lower animals show semblances of many humanlike emotion. The differences 
  reflect the differences in their brains, which also goes through a continuous 
  variation from lower to higher animals. </p>
  <p>SINA: Dark matter has not been observed or detected by any means. But its 
  presence is inferred because of its gravitational effect on visible matter 
  such as stars and galaxies </p>
  <p>APARTHIB: You do not understand the meaning of observation in science. 
  Inference is a vital component of observation. Observation does not always 
  mean DIRECT act of acquiring knowledge in science. It can be through indirect 
  inference, like quarks, gluons, dark matter. Scientific inferences are based 
  on precise measurements of other directly observable properties and applying 
  established scientific laws. No guesswork anywhere. Blackholes, planets of 
  distant stars are observed this way. </p>
  <p>Ali Sina: Well, it is not clear to me what are you saying here. Is it 
  possible that anything could exist beyond our observation or is it not? </p>
  <p>Aparthib: Its amazing you find it unclear. Yes, it is possible that 
  something could exist that is beyond our observation NOW. Dark matter is an 
  example of something that existed even before we &quot;observed&quot; it. But it is not 
  possible to REFER to it by specific name BEFORE it is observed, EXCEPT objects 
  whose existence are theoretically predicted like Blackholes were predicted 
  before they were observed(Cygnus-X1). God/Soul/Alien Abductio.. etc are not 
  predicted by any law, and some of them well-defined like God and Soul. </p>
  <p>I think I have clarified things as best as I possibly could. I may be 
  wrong. Or maybe even the best explanations would not suffice for some. Lets 
  move on. </p>
