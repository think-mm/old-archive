    it Takes to be a Rationalist</font></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center">By <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Author/Sina.htm">Ali
    Sina</a></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Not everyone who rejects religion can be called
    rationalist. To be rationalist one has to reject dogmatism. However, what is
    dogma is not well defined.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The dictionary definition of
    dogma is:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">1: a religious doctrine that
    is proclaimed as true without proof</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">2: a doctrine or code of
    beliefs accepted as authoritative;&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Dogma is not just the domain
    of religion. Blind belief in the undisputed authority of any thing is
    considered to be dogma. For example Marxism is a dogma even though it
    denounces religion and claims to be based on science.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Any authoritative principle,
    belief, or statement of ideas or opinion, when it is considered to be
    absolutely true is dogma. Once you accept something without enough evidence
    or reject something despite the evidence because it contradicts your notion
    of reality and truth you are dogmatic.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Is it possible for
    rationalists to be dogmatic too?&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Yes it is possible. Not all
    those who claim to be rationalist are so. For example a Marxist would
    vehemently deny being dogmatic. He thinks Marxism is the ultimate form of
    rationalism. As a matter of fact no one, not even the most close-minded
    religionist, thinks of himself as a dogmatic. Everyone thinks he is a
    freethinker and rationalist.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">So what are the parameters
    to define rationalism? How can we know whether we are truly rationalist or
    we are dogmatic?&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The answer is in the
    definition of dogmatism. As self-proclaimed rationalists we can easily
    dismiss the claim of the religionists that their belief is rational. Once
    you believe in something without evidence, you believe in a dogma and hence
    you can’t be called a rationalist. Take the example of creationism, the
    resurrection of Jesus, the ascension of Muhammad to the seventh heaven on
    the back of a winged steed, and many other religious beliefs of this kind.
    They are all dogma because not only there is no evidence for them; they are
    contrary to logic and science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;It must
    be mentioned that the religionists' response is that their belief is not
    irrational but it &quot;transcends&quot; rationality. I have not figured out
    what this really means except being a save face and a feel good factor. For
    example is trinity an irrational dogma or does it transcend rationality. It
    depends whom you ask. The point is no believer would want to be labeled as
    irrational.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The Marxists' belief in the
    dialectical materialism or the Nazis’ belief in Atlantis and the Super
    Race are all based on improvable beliefs and although they are not religious
    they are equally dogmatic and as we witnessed they were equally dangerous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Now what about the
    scientists? Can scientists be dogmatic?&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Of course they can.&nbsp;Take
    the example of evolution. This is purely science. At the same time that
    Darwin was presenting his theory of evolution through natural selection,
    Jean Baptiste Lamarck was proposing a different concept of evolution. His
    understanding of the fundamental mechanism for evolution was that fluids
    move through the body to areas of activity and enlarge the most active parts
    of an organism. As the result children inherit the changes that occur in
    their parents. Now this theory is completely discredited. The Nazis however,
    held Lamarckism as the dogma and made it the basis of their campaign to
    create their utopian Superior Race, which led to tremendous atrocities, as
    the history is witness.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">So as you see, even the
    scientists can be as much dogmatic as religionists.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Well, how can we determine
    whether we are dogmatic or not? There is of course an easy way to find out.
    Nevertheless, not everyone is able to acknowledge it. For example it is very
    easy to prove that the religious books are fables, irrational, unscientific
    and the belief in them, is dogmatism. But try to convince a religious
    believer that he is dogmatic. What you think would be his response?&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Likewise, I can prove that
    many self-declared rationalists and freethinkers are not rationalists or
    freethinkers but are as dogmatic as when they were religionists. All they
    have done is they changed their religion. Their religious attitude of denial
    and belief is not changed.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><u>Denial</u> and <u>belief</u>
    are the two characteristics of religious people. For example a religious
    person would deny any thought that may be contrary to his faith and of
    course would believe anything that agrees with it. A Christian
    fundamentalist would categorically deny the evidence about evolution because
    it contradicts what his sacred book says about creation. He is still
    referring to evolution as a “theory”. This is denial. He also believes
    that the first humans walking on Earth were Adam and Eve who were created
    and molded by God in his own semblance and then kicked out of paradise.
    There is absolutely no evidence for this belief, yet he is not concerned
    about evidence. He would accept anything that is written in his sacred book
    with no ifs or buts. This is belief.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Both denial and belief go
    hand. They are the twin pillars of dogmatism. For a believer, his sacred
    book is the ultimate measure of right and wrong. He would believe anything
    that agrees with that book and rejects anything that disagrees with it.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Dogmatism is not what we
    believe; it is the attitude of denial and belief. For example, you may
    believe that one day there was life on Mars even though you have no proof of
    it. This is not dogmatism. The fact is that we don’t know. This could be
    true as it could not be true. I suppose the Spirit and the Opportunity; our
    two Mars-rovers, now safely landed on the red planet, will tell us the truth
    eventually. Suppose I say there was life on Mars one day but then I am
    proven wrong, that does not mean I am dogmatic. However, if I insist that
    there is life on Mars, without having any evidence to back up my claim, or
    deny the evidences found to the contrary, I would be dogmatic. Dogmatism is
    not in what we believe. It is in our attitude.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Do some self proclaimed
    rationalists and scientists have dogmatic attitude?&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Yes they do. If you deny the
    evidence of things that you do not understand and try to dismiss them,
    explain them away, intellectualize and justifying them denying the evidences
    because they contradict your sacred belief, which in this case could be your
    limited understanding of science, you are, of course, dogmatic. In this case
    science or your limited understanding of it becomes your dogma.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Many, or perhaps it is safe
    to say most, self-proclaimed rationalists and scientists fall into this
    category.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
    true rationalists and freethinkers are rarer than diamond in a coal mine.
    Now, of course, this is not going to sit very well with the majority of the
    delusional rationalist wannabes. Just as if you call a religionists,
    &quot;dogmatic&quot; he will attack you, these self proclaimed rationalists
    would lynch and pillory you if you dare questioning their
    &quot;religion&quot; and their sacred belief.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">What is the name of the
    rationalist's religion?&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Rationalists do not believe
    in any religion. What we are talking about are the pseudo rationalists who
    call themselves rationalists and skeptics. To them science is a religion.&nbsp;Yes,
    indeed, science can be a substitute to religion. These people have not
    renounced their religion. They simply have changed it. They are still caught
    in denial and belief just as when they were religionists. They are still as
    much dogmatic, as when they were believers.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">We already saw that you do
    not need to believe in God to be dogmatic. The Marxists were atheists and
    yet were just as dogmatic as religionists. Likewise, you do not need to
    believe in a religion to be dogmatic. You may even renounce religions, and
    remain just as dogmatic as before.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Dogmatism is an attitude not
    a belief. Rational Thinking also is an attitude. It is the WAY you think,
    not WHAT you think that determines whether you are a rationalist or a
    dogmatic, a freethinker or a fanatic. What you believe or not believe is
    irrelevant --it is your attitude. That attitude is denial and belief. If you
    believe in anything or deny anything with no proof and evidence, you are
    dogmatic.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The requisite for
    rationalism is doubt. Doubt everything! Everything means everything. We all
    know how to doubt things that we already do not believe. That is not
    rationalism. To be a rationalist you have to doubt your own cherished
    beliefs not someone else’s. Even a Christian fundamentalist can tell you
    that he doubts the theory of evolution. That does not mean that he is
    rationalist. If you want to be a skeptic, you must be able to doubt your own
    beliefs not the beliefs of others that you already dismiss as untrue.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">You can’t be called
    skeptic or rationalist if all you can do is to dismiss the beliefs that you
    do not agree with already. This is not what skepticism is about. If that
    were the requisite for being a skeptic then everyone is skeptic of
    something. What entitles you to be called skeptic when a Christian
    fundamentalist also is skeptic of many things that you believe such as your
    idea in evolution?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You can only
    be called a skeptic if you can doubt your own beliefs.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Do you believe that science
    has the answer to all the human questions? If your answer is yes then you
    are a dogmatic? Science is growing. The science of 100 years ago is not the
    same science of today. We are constantly discovering new realities that were
    unknown to us. The science is evolving and changing. What seemed to be
    science fiction yesterday is a reality today. Recently scientists have found
    a way to make living cells talk to computer chips. When I was a child I used
    to watch the six million-dollar man and think of it as fantasy. Now that
    fantasy can become a reality may be in my own lifetime. When I was a child I
    was told that meditation is hocus-pocus and psychosomatics is fairytale.
    Now, science is discovering new frontiers in the mind body connection and
    medical science is beginning to take advantage of it.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">As rationalists we should not dismiss things
    that we do not understand. Rationalism is not yet another religion with
    science as its dogma. Science is evolving and there are realities that
    today’s science cannot explain, but tomorrow it may. There are evidences
    of phenomena for which today’s science has no answer. Take the example of
    aurora borealis. The early science was not able to explain it. How they were
    created? Where ghosts playing with flashlights? It was a phenomenon that was
    unexplainable. But it was absurd to deny it just because that day’s
    science could not explain it.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Many people have witnessed phenomena that
    today’s science cannot explain. There are those who claim to have seen
    ghosts, UFOs, big foot or big snake- like creatures in the sea. Now most
    likely these are all the product of human imagination. But are we sure? Is
    there a possibility that any one of these apparitions could be true? If not,
    why not? Here is what skepticism is needed. We have no proof that all these
    claims are false. There have been many publicity-seekers and pranksters that
    have forged&nbsp; “evidences” that can easily be dismissed. This does
    not invalidate the claim of those honest and sane people who say that have
    seen things that can't be explained scientifically.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">What shall we do with these claims? What should
    be the position of a true rationalist? Should he believe in these claims?
    Where is the solid evidence? Should he dismiss them all? Again where is the
    solid evidence? Are these claims absolutely impossible? Is it impossible for
    a humanoid, ancient relative of man, to have survived somewhere in the
    woods? Is it im possible that some intelligent creatures, from a distant
    planet have made their way to our planet, swishing in our skies with their
    flying spaceships that looks like saucers? Is it im possible that there
    could be a parallel world to ours with different dimensions. Is it
    impossible that the we may have a spiritual dimension and that the ghosts
    apparitions are flashes of that spiritual dimensional world crossing our
    three dimensional world? Is it im possible that a rare creature in the depth
    of the seas is yet undiscovered but occasionally is spotted by some seamen?
    The answer is, that all these phenomena are highly improbable. But
    improbable does not mean impossible. Until we do not have the evidence to
    dismiss them altogether, we should not deny the possibility that they could
    be true.&nbsp;<O:P>

    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Now a cynic may say then perhaps we should not
    dismiss the possibility of the existence of two headed dragons, the elves

    are impossible. The above examples are improbable but not impossible.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">The point is that there is nothing illogical or
    absurd in any of these claims even if they seem to be outlandish. The fact

    know much of the science. The future science may discover ways that would

    sloppy circles and have shown how they made them. This is not proof that all
    these crop circles are hoax. Some of these shapes are so intricate that it
    is absurd to think they were made by humans, overnight and without anyone
    seeing them. These designs appear everywhere on the planet. The science has
    no explanation for them. What should we do as rationalists? Should we just
    dismiss them, explain them away with absurd and implausible theories? Should
    we attribute them to some extraterrestrials? Are they natural phenomena? The
    correct answer is that we do not know and therefore we should not try to
    pass opinions of things that we do not know.&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">A pseudo rationalist friend
    on mine tried to dismiss this logic and wrote:&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><i>&quot;As an atheist, even
    I can answer this: Muslims basically do think that their God is malevolent,
    since he makes disbelievers drink boiling water. If you want to change his
    name from God to Satan, that's fine by me. This in no way constitutes proof
    for the absence of a God. He may well be malevolent, or maybe he can do only
    one thing at a time. E.g. if you have kids, are you able to control all your
    grandchildren all the time? Who knows. What you CAN say is that if there is
    a God, there is no evidence to suggest that he interferes on the
    earth.&quot;</i></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">This is the typical
    irrational and dogmatic reasoning we can see in religionists. As you can see
    even the self-proclaimed rationalists are not immune to irrational thinking.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">First of all Muslims do not
    think that their God is malevolent even though Allah is definitely a
    malevolent god. Muslims think that their god is merciful and all the sadism
    attributed to him in the Quran are not seen as cruelties by Muslims but as
    divine &quot;justice&quot;. After all Muslims are the epitome of
    irrationality.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Secondly, all the believers
    in God think that their God is omnipotent. Therefore according to them their
    god is multi tasking and does not need to abandon some of his kids to attend
    to his other kids. So the premises presented by my &quot;rationalist&quot;
    friend to refute the above argument is baseless. This is how irrational
    people justify their irrational beliefs --their premises are often wrong.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">We can dismiss God as a
    being, logically. I don't believe in God because it just makes no sense. It
    is contrary to reason and logic. I do believe, however, in a principle
    underlying the creation. This universe must be governed by a set of laws, or
    perhaps a single law that is expressed in many ways. This does not imply
    that there must be a lawmaker per force.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">2+2 = 4. This is a natural
    law. Do we need a legislator to making this into a law? Suppose there was no
    universe, no God and nothing existed. Would in that non-existing world two
    plus two add up to anything else but four? Laws can exist, even if the
    universe and God do not. And since the laws governing the universe can exist
    independent of God, the existence of God becomes redundant. It is much more
    logical to believe in the self-subsistence of the laws of the universe than
    in a god making those laws. If you can’t accept the laws existing on their
    own without a creator, how can you accept the existence of a god without a
    creator?&nbsp;<O:P>
    The former is logical, the latter is a dogma.</O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">So, “doubting
    everything”, does not license everyone to hold fast unto his or her
    spurious belief because they might one day be proven to be true? That is not
    rationalism at all. If something is proven to be false, then upholding it is
    irrational. The Earth is round. This is a fact and is proven to be true. You
    can’t doubt the roundness of the Earth and claim that since we have to
    doubt everything, then we should not dismiss the possibility that the Earth
    could be flat. Once something is proven to be a fact then we do not need to
    doubt it anymore. <O:P>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The same thing can be said
    about the evolution. Even though the evolution, when first was presented,
    was just a theory, it is no more. We have ample evidence and proof that
    evolution is a fact. We can’t doubt evolution anymore because the evidence
    is overwhelming. We do not believe in evolution nor we doubt it. The
    evolution is now part of our knowledge.&nbsp;We KNOW it.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">We must doubt things for

    can’t dismiss things that can’t be proven or disproven. As long as
    things are not entirely illogical or impossible, there is a chance, even
    though that chance could be minimal, based on what we know of science today,
    that they could be true.&nbsp;<O:P>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The challenge facing us
    rationalists is not to dismiss things that we do not understand or things
    that do not fit into our mental mold. Our challenge is to get rid of
    “belief” itself and learn to doubt. Our job is not to uphold the
    infallibility of the holy science when we know that science is yet at its
    infancy and there are many things that we still do not understand. Our job
    is to think out of the box. Yes, even out of the box of the science and
    accept the fact that there may be realities that are simply out of the realm
    of today’s science.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">These realities, should not
    contradict logic or science. If they do, they must be dismissed, but if they
    don’t they should be considered as possibilities. Event though these
    possibilities are improbable, as long as they are possible they are valid as
    such. Science should not fall into the quagmire of dogmatism. We can’t

    science disguised as skeptics. They can be likened to someone challenging
    you to measure the temperature with a measuring tape. Science can measure
    the world of matters. It can't scale things that may be of immaterial
    substance for example feelings. This is no proof that paranormal is a
    reality that should be taken seriously. We have no evidence to make such

    tell them personal things about the dead person they were enquiring about
    that the callers could recognize. Not all his “readings” were general
    descriptions that could be applied to everyone. For example, he told Larry
    King that his father had died in a factory. Considering, in so many places a
    person can die, this must have been a really good guess. Larry King was of
    course impressed. I thought the chance of this person just guessing things
    about all his callers was really slim. As a non-dogmatic rational thinker, I
    cannot dismiss this as coincidence. My dogmatic pseudo rationalist friend

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">I told him about a strange
    incidence that happened to myself when I was a university student. One
    summer night I was reading a book while my sister was sleeping in the
    adjacent room. I heard noises coming from her room. She was groaning as if
    having a nightmare. I went to her room to wake her up. What I saw took me by
    surprise. I saw a globe of orange light about three feet in diameter
    suddenly moving away from my sister's bed and hovering in the middle of the
    room. I stood at the door watching this strange thing. I got the impression
    that this thing was also startled. This thing seemed to have a thought of
    its own. For a moment we both were paralyzed gazing at each other. Then the
    thing zoomed out of the window and disappeared in the adjacent field
    practically in thin air. I woke up my sister and told her what I saw. She
    said she was having a bad dream and in her dream a bad being wanted to hurt
    her while someone good had come to her rescue. Well, people have dreams and
    nothing is strange about that. However, what to me seemed to be strange is
    that I possibly saw one of the protagonists of my sister’s dream. Even if
    that is not the case, that thing was strange on its own. &nbsp;<O:P>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">I have no explanation for
    that thing and I do not attempt to speculate or comment about things I do
    not understand. I know I saw something. I know it was real. But I do not
    know what it was. However, the explanations given by some pseudo
    rationalists seems to be less convincing than those given by Muslims trying
    to explain the absurdities of the miracles attributed to Muhammad. It is
    simply disappointing to see so many, otherwise intelligent people, are so
    dogmatic that they are genuinely unable to acknowledge that it is possible
    that they could not know everything. And that their notion of truth could be
    utterly distorted and incomplete. These people are not rationalists. They

    and try to &quot;enlighten&quot; everyone else with their benighted answers?
    Their answer is that all these things are hoax, coincidences or human

    took place, how the flood filled the Earth at the time of Noah and how Jesus
    raised from the death, it will also find a scientific answer to all that.
    Meanwhile, all you have to do is to keep your faith alive. One day, you and

    masses who thirst to know and who know that the scientists are in denial and
    are lying to them.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">This is the danger. People
    who have had paranormal experiences first hand, know that “it is all in
    your imagination”, is not the answer. Going back to our previous example.
    The skeptics use the measuring tape and when they see no difference in the
    sizes of the objects, they deny the rise and fall of the temperature.
    Meanwhile people know when they get hot and when they get cold and the
    scientist’s insistence that “it is all in your imagination” is not
    cutting with them. If all science is equipped with is a measuring tape, they
    will keep denying the change of temperature while the question of the
    temperature remains unanswered.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">This opens doors of
    opportunities for charlatans and con artists to sell their wacky explanation
    and mislead the masses. That is why the market of the religionists is still
    bullish and that is why New Age religions are sprouting everywhere. People
    are willing to submit to the craziest ideas like Celestial Prophesies, A
    Course In Miracles and a myriad of cult and religions to get an answer.
    Believe it or not there is even a guy who claims to be the messenger of the
    extraterrestrials.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">When the scientific
    community is living in denial the charlatans take over and the result is
    chaos. When I read about these religions and cults I am amazed of the
    stupidity of my fellow humans. How much are we willing to compromise our
    intelligence to buy into these idiotic and asinine beliefs? These New Age
    cults are even crazier than those invented and believed by our forefathers.
    There is a spiritual reality out there, which we do not understand. There is
    a thirst to find an answer to all these enigmas of life. But why follow
    these stupid archaic religions and modern cults in the search of the answer?&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">We are living in a mad, mad,
    mad world. Just take a look at the absurdity of the beliefs around you. For
    now put aside your own religion and take a look at what others believe.
    Witness the level of stupidity of these beliefs. Then understand that your
    belief is no different. Do not try to convince yourself that your religion
    is rational, logical and scientific. You’d be only fooling yourself.
    Beliefs are stupid; beliefs are dangerous, even if they are based on
    science. Your belief is just as irrational and wrong as the belief of the
    one whom you pity. We all need to be pitied. This is a pitiful world.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">All beliefs are spurious. It
    is the nature of beliefs to be spurious. Beliefs are for unenlightened
    people. For how long shall we remain benighted? For how long do we want to
    fool ourselves?&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The scientific community has
    failed the world as much as those whom they decry as fanatics. This is the
    plant of silly people, inhabited by silly people, run by silly people.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Everything we do is wrong,
    because everything we do is based on faith. Everyone is a believer. Everyone
    pays homage to faith. And what is faith? Faith is belief in something
    without evidence. This is insane. That is why the world is so insane&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">I hope one day, we learn to
    believe less and doubt more. May be then we will stop feeling
    self-righteous, stop disparaging others and stop these crazy wars and
    killings. May be doubt is the key to our salvation and our peace.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The scientific community
    must pull out its head out of the sand and study the phenomena that it does
    not understand. These phenomena cannot be explained by science. As I said
    above we need to study them in their own terms. If our measuring tape is no
    good to scale them, we have to invent a “thermometer” to gauge them. We
    need a new instrument to study and unravel the spiritual realm, even though
    the method must remain scientific.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The word needs spirituality
    because the word is a spiritual world. The denial of this fact will not make
    it go away. The danger of this denial is that people fall prey to the cons
    that promise them heaven and deliver then hell.&nbsp;<O:P>
    </O:P>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">It is time that we listen to
    this inner voice within us. May be, we are spiritual creatures? May be, we
    need spirituality. Why not study this scientifically? I do not mean through
    science but through scientific methods. As long as the scientific community
    keeps its head under the sand and lives in denial the prophets, the priests,
    the con artists and the quacks feast on us, fool us and take us for a ride.

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The objective of this essay
    is not to make you believe in paranormal, ghosts, exorcism, ETs or Yeties.
    No rational person should believe in anything unless undeniable evidence has
    been presented. We have no such evidence to back up the above claims. Most
    of them are more likely false than true.&nbsp; The purpose of this essay is
    to highlight the flaws in the thinking of the rationalist wannabes. It is
    just to make you see that not everyone who calls himself a rational thinker
    is indeed a rational thinker. My objective in writing this essay was to jolt
    the self righteous self proclaimed rationalists into reality and ask them to
    descend form their pedestal of infallibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">All
    I wanted to say is: Do not call a kettle black if you are a pot.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">Also,
    may be it is time that we reclaim our own morality and release it from the
    monopoly of religions. By attaching morality to religion, those who rejected
    religions have also jettisoned the morality. That is like throwing the baby
    with the bathwater. This mistake only gives validity to religions and
    justifies their survival. There is much to do and to understand and yet the
    rationalists prefer to deny the fact that there is more to this world than
    what can be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Happy Rationalist Day to all
    the rationalists, pseudo rationalists, wannabe rationalists, quasi
    rationalists and irrationalists of the world even though I see no reason to
    celebrate.&nbsp;</p>
