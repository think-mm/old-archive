    Dear oh dear. When has Avijit ever claimed to be certain<br>
    of anything? As far as I am aware, he is willing to change<br>
    his mind, if REPRODUCIBLE EVIDENCE is provided.<br>
    Do you have such a thing? Please forgive him for being<br>
    skeptical while there is nothing to analyse except dead<br>
    people apparently saying &quot;I'm happy&quot;. If you can provide<br>
    more scientific testing of Praagh, ie getting dead people<br>
    to recount specific details that can be consistently verified,<br>
    he will probably not only change his mind, he will start<br>
    using this newfound tool and put it to decent use. Just<br>
    imagine all the unsolved murders that could be solved if<br>
    instead of murder victims saying &quot;my death was very<br>
    violent&quot; to Praagh, they said &quot;I was murdered by someone<br>
    who was 180cm tall, blonde hair, scar on his right nose&quot;<br>
    etc etc. Hell, some innocent people may even get let out<br>
    of jail too. What are we waiting for?<br>

    critical thinking, or at least, you claim you do. All you need<br>
    to do now is apply it. The logic has already been spelled<br>

    More accurately, you have failed to think critically, and<br>
    instead decided to apply her vague dream to any situation<br>
    that you can possibly find a remote, tenuous link. You<br>
    have managed to &quot;predict the past&quot;. Look up &quot;bible
    codes&quot;<br>
    and see how these were found in &quot;Moby Dick&quot; too.<br>

    any aspect of real life.<br>

    By the way, last night I dreamt I was having sex with<br>
    Nicole Kidman (I must say, your dreams are pretty<br>
    tame). And guess what? I just found out she got a new<br>
    boyfriend yesterday, and presumably had sex with him.<br>

    Ok, so dreams about giants are dreams about maids, and<br>
    dreams about a friend smoking, are dreams about tempers.<br>
    So we've managed to get 2 hits, when I had a count of 0.<br>
    <br>
    In this case, we are not even disputing the original claim<br>
    of the dream. I know I had the dream. Although I should<br>
    point out that if I was going to start doing critical science<br>
    based on my dreams, I would get a 3rd party to verify<br>
    that I wasn't having the dreams after the event, or some<br>
    other trigger. E.g. there was a case of a horse that could<br>
    apparently do arithmetic. It couldn't. The owner was<br>
    accidentally raising his eyebrows on expectation of the<br>
    answer. I would doubt my own dreams before accepting<br>
    them as proof of anything. I would tell the likes of Randi<br>
    that I have been having some weird dreams that seem to<br>
    predict the future. Is there any test we can come up with<br>
    to verify this? More likely I've just managed to fool myself.<br>
    That's what the independent testing is for. Doubt yourself!<br>
    <br>
    But despite the fact that the original claim is not even in<br>
    dispute, you manage to get a hit, when I count a miss. Given<br>
    your propensity to interpret dreams in as ridiculous a<br>
    fashion as necessary to confirm your own prejudices, it is<br>
    no wonder that true skeptics do not wish you use your<br>
    anecdotal accounts of dreams as &quot;proof positive&quot; that there<br>
    exists a spiritual dimension.<br>
    <br>
    The possibility remains. But until proper evidence is<br>
    provided, the skeptic will not accept that proof, or even<br>
    evidence, of existence has been provided YET.<br>

    It's not a matter of belief. We can read transcripts of these<br>

    <br>
    I was speaking to a woman from India who saw a man<br>
    levitate, and she was going to claim the AUD$20,000<br>
    offered by the Australian Skeptics Society for introducing<br>
    the levtitator to the Australian Skeptics (the levitator gets<br>
    AUD$80k).<br>
    <br>
    Since then I did a bit of research and found out on the<br>
    Mukto Mona site how it is actually done (with bamboo<br>
    sticks and a drape). I expect when I speak to her again,<br>
    and confirm that there was a drape over the levitator, it<br>
    will ring a bell, and she will say, yes, I guess bamboo<br>
    sticks could have been used. I'm not saying the man<br>
    DEFINITELY didn't levitate. I'm just saying the bamboo<br>
    sticks is far more likely, especially given that we have no<br>
    recorded instance of anyone ever levitating, but we do have<br>
    instances of people holding bamboo sticks.<br>

    I'm not sure it is possible that they can be wrong, I don't<br>
    think they are actually claiming anything. They are simply<br>
    saying &quot;this could POSSIBLY/PROBABLY be explained<br>
    by cold/hot reading, selective memory, wish-fulfillment,<br>
    abysmal critical thinking skills&quot; (to quote someone else).<br>
    <br>
    I think all of us agree it is POSSIBLE that Praagh is<br>
    speaking to the dead. But we'd probably also agree that<br>
    he is terribly squandering his great gift. He shouldn't be<br>
    wasting time doing TV shows where no useful information<br>
    is provided to the caller except &quot;I love you&quot;. He should<br>
    be drafted into the military/CIA etc and find out e.g. who<br>
    killed Daniel Pearl. The dead could be of enormous<br>
    benefit to us. We could use them to save lives in the future,<br>
    by identifying murderers. Hopefully the technique could<br>
    be used to fill in a lot of blanks in history.<br>
    <br>
    The paranormal would be a very exciting and useful tool.<br>
    All scientists are eagerly waiting in line to get this. No-one<br>
    WANTS it to be false. There's no advantage in losing this<br>
    skill. When I'm dead, I'd much rather be able to stick<br>
    around and read books in the spirit world or whatever<br>
    activities are available. I'm not actually attracted to being<br>
    eaten by worms, you realise?<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately, to date, there's no evidence of anything<br>
    except worms. Very unfortunately. No scientist enjoys<br>

    I'm more interested in knowing why you couldn't see the<br>

    No-one is interested in who says what. What we're all<br>
    looking for is a logical argument for OURSELVES. If<br>
    I can get such logical reason from reading Avijit's posts,<br>
    then so be it. Incidentally, I get such logical reading from<br>
    you about Islam. I quote you often. You reasoning is very<br>
    very good. The fact that in your spare time you happen to<br>
    believe your own set of fairies in no way affects the logic<br>
    of your Islamic debates. It is absolutely chock-a-block<br>
    full of cold hard critical thinking. It is actually beautiful<br>
    to read. So are Avajit and Aparthib's posts.<br>

    Actually, all they wanted to do was apply critical reasoning<br>
    to find out whether this was the &quot;first one&quot;, ie the first person<br>
    who had paranormal ability. We've had so many millions of<br>
    disappointments in the past, that we don't have much hope<br>
    yet. So certainly we look long and hard, and insist on<br>
    very thorough scientific scrutiny of any claims. The odds are<br>
    very low based on past experience. But someone always<br>
    needs to be first.<br>

    You've got it the wrong way around. What is the evidence<br>
    that Praagh has presented showing he can talk to the dead,<br>
    that passes scientific scrutiny?<br>
    <br>
    The skeptics haven't found anything that couldn't otherwise<br>
    be explained by more mundane explanations. You need to<br>
    go to a lot of effort. E.g. line up 100 sons of murder victims,<br>
    and get Praagh to describe the murderer. This is then<br>
    cross-checked with police records. This is the sort of<br>
    thing we are looking for. I can give you more details, the<br>
    scientific testing needs to ensure that there is no way that<br>
    he simply looked up the police records before-hand. You<br>
    have to be very very careful with these tests.<br>
    <br>
    But the tests can be done. Certainly to the point that it is<br>
    very impressive to a skeptic, and the skeptics are very<br>
    keen for further testing of what is probably a &quot;national<br>
    treasure&quot;.<br>

    Science is never about winning popularity contests. The<br>
    people who said the earth was round, or that the earth<br>
    revolved around the sun, weren't particularly popular.<br>
    Those who say the most likely end for humans is being<br>
    eaten by worms, and in fact, there is no evidence to<br>
    suggest that humans are any different from any other<br>
    animal as far as evidence for &quot;souls&quot; are concerned.<br>
    It is most likely we will simply be the same worm-food<br>
    that cockroaches are.<br>
    <br>
    These are not popular things. People don't want to know<br>
    cold, hard reality. The thought of a benevolent god<br>
    watching over us is so much more attractive, so much more<br>
    comforting. Really, I wish it were true. I would love for<br>
    there to be a god, I'd ask him to fix a lot of things here on<br>
    earth. And to please stop us from squabbling over which<br>
    religion is correct, to the point that Islamists have declared<br>
    war on the infidels. If only it were true. If only.<br>

    But blind belief never enters the scientific process. The<br>

    opportunity to talk to such great men as Praagh when you're<br>

    frankly, I don't care that much. There's you and 5 billion<br>
    other people who are scared of dying and desperately<br>
    want to believe in an afterlife. My only interest is the<br>

    Incorrect. I did not know how the Indian man managed<br>
    to levitate. It is only recently that I found out that it is<br>
    something as mundane as bamboo sticks. That didn't<br>
    mean that a scientific explanation didn't exist all along,<br>
    ie one that didn't involve a paranormal gravity-reverse<br>
    ability of the Indian man. Just because I don't know it,<br>
    doesn't mean it doesn't exist.<br>
    <br>
    In the case of the Indian levitator, I would have done<br>
    two things:<br>
    <br>
    1. Ask in a group of skeptics if they already knew how.<br>
    <br>
    2. Ask for the Indian levitator to be scientifically tested,<br>
    as an anti-gravitational device would be immensely<br>
    useful for getting satellites launched more cost-effectively.<br>
    <br>
    I would not be so vain that I would think that I could think<br>
    of every single possibility, and that if I couldn't, no-one<br>
    could. I am happy to look at explanations from any source,<br>
    and then I make my own judgement as to whether they are<br>
    rational or not.<br>

    It is not so much because of his view, as because he<br>
    has asked where the scientific evidence is. It is the<br>
    absence of scientific evidence that causes skeptics<br>
    to be skeptical, not one man's opinion, no matter who<br>
    that man is, no matter whether it is Randi or Avijit.<br>
    In fact, if you actually ask Randi or Avijit whether<br>
    they would like you to consider them as &quot;authorities&quot;<br>
    who need to be deferred to, they will almost certainly<br>
    reply &quot;certainly not - anything I say should be<br>
    independently verifiable if you want to accept it as<br>
    scientific fact&quot;. Scientists do not expect, nor do they<br>
    want, to be treated like gods. Basically, because that<br>
    creates a risk of their own mistakes not being found<br>
    and fixed, which doesn't help science one iota.<br>

    Incorrect. No-one denied whether or not you had an<br>
    experience. No-one actually knows. There's no way to<br>
    scientifically prove that either way.<br>
    <br>
    What we do have is incontrovertible proof that you just<br>
    accused Avijit of saying something he didn't say. And<br>
    that's incontroverible proof that you should never rely on<br>
    anecdotal evidence in order to prove things. Human<br>
    beings are extremely unreliable. Sometimes accidentally,<br>
    sometimes deliberately. In the case of Mohammed and<br>
    Sina, everything should be taken with several grains of<br>
    salt!<br>
    <br>
    These people in particular should have everything they<br>
    say subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny, since they<br>
    have been caught out making some outrageous and<br>
    easily-disproved statements.<br>
    <br>
    E.g. you said that I had &quot;no answer&quot; to the &quot;orange
    light&quot;,<br>
    despite the fact that you hadn't even told me about the<br>
    &quot;orange light&quot;. So you actually started making insinuations<br>
    about my tongue-tiedness based on something that never<br>
    happened. In this case, there was an innocent explanation,<br>
    mere confusion, it wasn't deliberate lying. I actually don't<br>
    have any problem with this at all. My supposed<br>
    tongue-tiedness had no impact on the scientific discussion,<br>
    any more than you calling me a pseudo-rationalist. These<br>
    names don't actually affect the ultimate logic that would<br>
    pass scientific scrutiny.<br>

    And at the end of the day, there is no scientific evidence<br>
    that dreams have any predictive (ie paranormal) capability.<br>
    The maid fell off the roof instead of being forewarned, the<br>
    lottery-dreamer didn't win the lottery, the non-smoker<br>
    didn't start smoking, and the obnoxious person you referred<br>
    to was already obnoxious before the dream. In fact, he's<br>
    been a bit of an obnoxious bastard his whole life. Mentions<br>
    worms a lot too.<br>
    <br>
    Note that these things are dealing with *external events*.<br>
    No predictive ability for external things. There is nothing<br>
    stopping you from dreaming about an apple falling off a<br>
    tree and hitting you in the head, and then being inspired<br>
    by that to form some theory. This is all internal stuff.<br>
    <br>
    Nothing here relies on the paranormal to explain anything.<br>
    Hell, it is actually possible that the apple that hit Newton<br>
    didn't fall off a tree, it was actually thrown by god,<br>
    because god wanted Newton to &quot;discover&quot; gravity. But<br>
    just because it COULD have been caused by god, does<br>
    not mean that it WAS caused by god. In fact, guided by<br>
    Occam's Razor, we'd probably say that the tree is the<br>
    safer bet. Certainly, there's not a scrap of evidence that<br>
    there was god, or any other paranormal involved. There<br>
    is however physical evidence of a tree, an apple tree no<br>

    No. It is probably only semi-accurate in fact. Some of<br>

    Were Egyptians the first to mummify people? Maybe.<br>

    your ability, and in the meantime, don't sit idly by watching<br>
    giant maids plunge to their death when you already supposedly<br>
    knew that this was going to happen via the spirit world.<br>
    <br>
    Scientists don't consider their position to be dogmatic<br>
    or unreasonable. They also think that you calling them<br>
    pseudo-rationalists is the pot calling the kettle black,<br>
    and that you accusing others of being the pot calling<br>
    the kettle black is the sign of a pot telling a kettle that<br>
    the pot is calling the kettle blacker than the first pot<br>
    that referred to the first kettle. Give it up, Ali. You've<br>
    lost the plot. Apologies will be graciously accepted,<br>
    I'm gracious as well as obnoxious. And don't worry,<br>
    I'll lean on the other &quot;pseudo-rationalists&quot; to be as<br>
    gracious as me in accepting your humble apologies.<br>
    <br>
