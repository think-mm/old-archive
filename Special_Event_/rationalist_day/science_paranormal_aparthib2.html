    <p>I found <a href="rationalism_meeker.htm">Brent Meeker's original response
    to Ali Sina</a> reflecting my own views so accurately that I felt tempted to
    respond to Ali Sina's response to Brent Meeker. I hope Brent would not mind
    my doing that. Please forgive any typo in my hurriedly written response.</p>
    <p align="center"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF"><font size="5"><b>1.</b></font></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;In response to Brent Meeker's comment:&nbsp; &quot;Sina notes the
    contrast between this and religious and political doctrines that are held to
    be beyond criticism and revision. But he presents a false dichotomy between
    dogmatism and rationalism - as though one can be rational simply by not
    being dogmatic.&quot;</p>
    <p>Ali Sina wrote: Yes I actually do think that dogmatism and rationalism
    are mutually excluding. You seem to disagree, however you did not provide
    any further explanation. Are you saying it is possible to be dogmatic and
    rationalist on one particular issue at the same time?</p>
    <p>Aparthib's Comment :</p>
    <p>Ali Sina is having some problem with the notions of logical fallacies,
    here the fallacy of false dichotomy. Brent was simply pointing out the false
    dichotomy between dogma and rationality. Pointing out the False dichotomy
    does not imply that dogmatism and rationalism are NOT mutually excluding, as
    Ali Sina is alleging it did. What Brent meant that one can be irrational but
    still NOT dogmatic. So there are 3 possibilities: (1) Dogmatic (2)
    Irrational (e.g non-dogmatic credulity) (3) Rational</p>
    <p>Not being (1) does not guarantee being (3), one can be (2).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="5"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">2</span></b></font><span style="background-color: #00FFFF"><font size="5"><b>.</b></font></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ali Sina was confused by and in disagreement with Brent Meeker's
    following statement:</p>
    <p><i>&quot;The opposite of dogmatic denial isn't rationality; it's
    uncritical credulity.&quot;,</i></p>
    <p>He wondered if he was missing something here. He indeed missed something.
    And it was the proper interpretation of of Brent's statement, although to me
    the meaning was clear from the context of his entire article. By
    &quot;dogmatic denial&quot; (he was really quoting Sina using such
    expression) he meant the denial of paranormal of so-called
    &quot;pseudo-rationalists&quot; (Again an expression used by Sina). So
    clearly the &quot;opposite of dogmatic denial&quot; refers to the views of
    people like Sina who are opposed to such dogmatic denial (of paranormal). So
    the final implication of Brent's statement was that the views of people like
    Sina who are opposed to dogmatic denial (of paranormal) do not NECESSARILY
    mean rationality, but CAN mean uncritical credulity (of paranormal). My
    position here is that the opposite of &quot;Sina's view&quot; is not
    NECESSARILY pseudo-rationality, but true rationality. Of course here I am
    assuming that Sina's position on paranormal is that the paranormal event
    &quot;HAS occurred.&quot;. My view and I believe the view of true
    rationalists is that paranormal event MAY have occurred, but since anecdotes
    are not genuine evidences for its occurrence, so it CANNOT be said that it
    HAS occurred.</p>
    <p align="center"><font size="5"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">3.</span></b></font></p>
    <p>Ali Sina:</p>
    <p>However, I am not prone to hallucinations and that thing did not seem to
    be hallucination at all. It was as real as any other object I have seen in
    my awaken life. We also have cases of several people reporting to have seen
    the same ghost at the same time. How can you scientifically prove that
    several people hallucinate together and see the same thing? We are not
    talking about guided imagery or induced hypnosis. So what is your
    explanation? Dogmatism is inability to accept anything that defies one's
    preconceived notion of reality</p>
    <p>Aparthib:</p>
    <p>This part brings out the crux of the whole problem. Insisting on
    anecdotes as proof of occurrence. Yes, Sina, I have no doubt you believe you
    are not susceptible to hallucinations. Nobody ever doubts themselves except
    some true skeptic (May be Vic Stenger is one). Your sincerity and confidence
    notwithstanding, the fact remains that brain induced visions are as real as
    observations of REAL events. There are enough brain induced experiences
    simulated in the lab, which appears real to true skeptics. The experiments
    of psychologist Persinger bears that out. You may also wish to read the book
    &quot;Phantoms in the Brain&quot; by Neurologist Ramachandran to learn about
    the bizarre way brain can induce perceptions of reality. So emphatically
    vouching for one's sincerity is hardly a genuine evidence of the REAL
    OCCURRENCE of paranormal to a true skeptic.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Ali Sina: Dogmatism is inability to accept anything that defies one's
    preconceived notion of reality</p>
    <p>Aparthib: Thats a loaded statement. What a true rationalist is unable to
    accept is not &quot;anything that defies one's preconceived notion of
    reality&quot;, but rather &quot;Claims of occurrence of any event based on
    anecdotes&quot;. There is a clear and fundamental difference. A rationalist
    do not have a preconceived notion of reality, or even if he has one, that
    does not factor in the acceptance of the claim. Only objective evidence can
    influence his/her acceptance of such claim.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ali Sina:</p>
    <p>Let me again quote the dictionary definition of paranormal. &quot;Beyond
    the range of normal experience or scientific explanation.&quot; If the globe
    I saw and what many other people see as ghosts cannot be explained by
    science what other names you have for them?</p>
    <p>Aparthib:</p>
    <p>The last part of the above is an example of the fallacy of complex
    question, there is a built in assumption that paranormal event HAS occurred,
    and since there is no scientific explanation, then why not call it as
    paranormal, right?. But before something is declared as paranormal due to
    lack of scientific explanation, it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt to
    have actually occurred. Again anecdotes do not qualify as proof beyond
    reasonable doubt to a rationalist. Ali Sina failed to separate the two
    independent issue of OCCURRENCE of paranormal and EXPLANATION of a putative paranormal.
    &quot;Seeing&quot; is not an evidence for the objective occurrence of an
    event. Brain can create a simulation of reality (for various reason beyond
    the control of the person whose brain is interpreting reality) that may be
    indistinguishable from real occurrence. We can never be sure about our
    brain's interpretation of reality until a scientific observations
    corroborates that independently. This statement is consistent with
    skepticism. To contradict this statement is to contradict skepticism (Thus
    rationalism).</p>
    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ali Sina:</p>
    <p>I also have one challenge for you. Looks like issuing challenges is fun.
    So let me make one challenge. Please present yourself as a psychic in a
    radio or an assembly of people and convince as many people as Van Praagh
    does, that you are bringing messages from their dead relatives.</p>
    <p>This should not be difficult to do. You seem to have found the trick that
    Van Praagh and other so called psychics play. Why don't you replicate that
    trick for us? If I discover the tricks of any magician, with a little
    practice I can do exactly what they do. So what do you say? You will manage
    to prove without the shadow of doubt that this is all a hoax and psychic
    power does not exist.</p>
    <p>Aparthib:</p>
    <p>Ali Sina misunderstood the skeptic's position and Occam's razor on
    paranormal again. Brent Meeker or any skeptic will never claim that they
    have the true explanation of paranormal. First a paranormal event must be
    agreed upon to have OCCURRED, to be called paranormal. The occurrence has to
    be verified in controlled environment. Again, Van Praagh's performences have
    not been subjected to a controlled experiment, as far as I can tell, and
    there are too many variables. Besides one can set up a plausible explanation
    based on whatever variable that are known. So Occam's razor already rules
    out any other explanation than the plausible one. Then why insist on the
    other explanations that are not dictated by Occam's razor? In the spirit of
    true skepticism, we should state that there is no accurate explanation of
    the event, but also that there is no true evidence of its occurrence either,
    because here the word &quot;occurrence&quot; has a loaded meaning. It
    carries a certain interpretation of the sequence of occurrences as well, not
    just a certain sequence of events.</p>
    <p>We cannot explain many magic, does it mean we should call magic as
    paranormal? If we do not call magic paranormal/psychic, then why call Van
    Praag's tricks paranormal/psychic? Just because magicians have been gracious
    enough to admit that there is nothing psychic behind their tricks and
    gracious enough to reveal the tricks behind many of their tricks? The
    exposed tricks behind many magic gives the plausibility arguments of
    putative paranormals more credibility.</p>
    <p>Finally Ali Sina, when you say &quot;you have no problem embracing your
    spiritual reality, that you are a spiritual being foremost&quot;, you are
    actually stating a sentiment, a feeling, an emotion, not an objective
    reality. Spiritual reality has no objective meaning. I share that same
    sentiment, emotion and feeling as you do (Einstein called it the feeling of
    the mysterious), but I or any skpetic would not call it spiritual reality
    and ascribe an objective reality to it.</p>
