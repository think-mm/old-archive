line-height:150%">I must agree here that after the 9-11 (2001), I was becoming 
    more and more intrigued by&nbsp;my religion of Birth, Islam, and as I stumbled on 
    to Faith Freedom International website of Ali Sina, I quickly realized why 
    there are so many troubles with my long-revered religion. But as I was 
    running away from Islam, I was also seeking an Alternative Avenue 
    (Religion/Ideology) to looking forward to and just about that time, our 
    dearest Ali Sina really brought <strong><i>&quot;great hope&quot;</i></strong> by 
    presenting his new ideology: <em><b>
    <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina40313.htm" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
    <span style="font-style:normal">Rational Spirituality</span></a></b></em>. I 
    have found Ali to be a <b><i>great rationalist</i></b> – his FFI site is an 
    outstanding testament of that, which helped me come out of the domain of 
    Islam quickly. But I also felt a need to rest my hope on something which is 
    rational, illuminating and self-improving. Else,&nbsp;I would feel a sense of 
    helplessness and emptiness in my mind and soul. Ali displayed another 
    outstanding testament of his great rationality by presenting his <strong><i>
    &quot;Rational Spirituality&quot;, </i><span style="font-weight: normal">a great 
    ideology for our modern time. This is </span></strong><i>just something</i> 
    I was looking forward to; immense thanks to Ali.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><em><b><span style="background-color: #99FF99">My own 
    paranormal experiences</span></b></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">The skeptics may be barking aloud about the absence of 
    paranormals but paranormals do keep showing glimpses all the time. It is not 
    only Ali and his mom (for Paul's attention), I do have my own and more 
    surefire experience of paranormal. Here is the story:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><em><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:150%">I 
    appeared the English Proficiency Test (TOEFL) in 1995. Guess what? I saw a 
    dream two nights before I was going to get the score-report – “I got a score 
    of 557” (my English has always been poor). Next day when I was going for a 
    roam with my friend and room-mate, I told him I saw in my dream that I have 
    got a score of 557 in my TOEFL. The following day, when we went to school 
    but my room-mate came back to room during lunch-time and he spotted the 
    letter containing the&nbsp;score. He was curious because I had told him I about 
    the score I saw in my dream and hence he couldn't hold his curiosity and 
    opened the letter without my consent. And when he saw the score was exactly 
    &quot;557&quot;, he was so surprised that he concealed the letter so that he can give 
    the message to me. Of course, when I came back to the hall in the evening 
    and spotted him, he rushed over and told me &quot;your score is here and you must 
    guess how much it is.&quot; Of course, I could not give him a figure and when he 
    revealed the score I was also astonished.</span></b></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><em><span style="font-style: normal">Now I draw attention of 
    those skeptics who refuted Ali’s claim by&nbsp;arguing, </span>&quot;Ali's mom saw a 
    giant and it was the maid who died - what nonsense?&quot;<span style="font-style: normal"> 
    But in case of my own paranormal experience, this is no such nonsense. My 
    experience was precise and something I had shared with a friend and I could 
    share that with any number of people. This is not simply my own experience 
    but I did communicate it with another friend. </span><b>How about this, my 
    skeptic friends?</b><span style="font-style: normal"> So, here I make it 
    clear: paranormals don’t just come to you as blur hints as claimed by Ali; 
    they also come to you with absolute clarity.</span></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">Of course, I have experienced blur paranormals many a times 
    like Ali’s own experiences of seeing a fire-ball in his sister’s room. Quite 
    a few times, when I woke up from sleep all on a sudden and opened my eyes, I 
    saw <b><i>&quot;flashes of light&quot;</i></b> which disappeared quickly - I couldn't 
    see it many more. These are all my true experiences - believe me <em><b>&quot;no 
    lies, no deception here.&quot;</b></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">And recently my Chinese friend explained another great example 
    of paranormals. Who says, souls don’t exist? Her story is as follows:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.25in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><b><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;line-height:150%">In 
    Chinese belief after people’s death, their souls live on and they do come to 
    &nbsp;visit the left-behind kins at specified time. One such visit will be on the 
    49<sup>th</sup> (?) day. And there is a clear testament of that. Chinese 
    people will traditionally put rice in a pot with the surface leveled and 
    leave it in an empty room. Then, every one must go to sleep. Next morning, 
    they will see a mark of a hand on the surface of the rice which they believe 
    was left by the soul that came to visit the left-behind family. When I asked 
    if anyone ever kept a watch overnight to see anyone enter the room to leave 
    that said mark, she quickly &nbsp;retorted<span style="color:blue">: no, you 
    cannot keep a watch, everyone must sleep; if someone is awake, soul will not 
    come, it will be scared away. </span>When I asked how she came to know that 
    the soul will not come when people are awake, she couldn’t answer. Still, 
    souls do live on and keep coming back to visit left-behind family – this 
    cannot be just lies. Not only that souls live on, they also leave hand-marks 
    on a pot of rice, isn’t it a great thing.</span></i></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">Indeed, paranormals keep happening around all the time but 
    those like Ali,
    <a href="http://skepdic.com/vanpraagh.html" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
    Van Praagh <i>et al.</i></a> who are endowed with special 
    power/curiosity/ability are the only ones able to notice or realize them. 
    For example, although I myself had experienced the most-assuring paranormal 
    but I couldn't&nbsp;realize it at the time – not until Ali’s latest revelation of 
    his new-found <b><i>Rational Spirituality</i></b>. This is because I wasn't 
    born with that special gift of the Almighty.&nbsp;Indeed,&nbsp;I even didn't have an 
    idea about&nbsp;the concept of paranormals (not educated enough) - how could I 
    ever know then I ever experienced it? In reality, most people around are 
    probably insensitive or ignorant like me, not endowed with that special 
    attentiveness to events and&nbsp;the skeptics are the most insensitive bunch 
    around. They not only fail to notice/grasp all the paranormals happening 
    around them - one cannot even convince them about these conspicuous events 
    with most assuring experiences as Ali has already expounded in great details 
    and with great patience. And surely, the skeptics will find an irrational 
    way to rubbish my <strong><i>own true and bullet-proof experience </i>
    </strong>of paranormals.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><em><b><span style="background-color: #99FF99">Why this 
    religion?</span></b></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">I was born religious Muslim. There are so many things on earth 
    that we cannot explain. And there is a strong point in the argument that <b>
    <i>this universe has to be created by someone.</i></b> However we can now, 
    with the greatly advanced rational thinking and science, easily rubbish all 
    the age-old religions established in the distant past by inane and dogmatic 
    believers who were uneducated and often brutal murderers like Prophets Moses 
    and Muhammad. Of course, with the help of science, we can easily refute that 
    Jesus was no angel, a Holy Ghost could not impregnate <b><i>“mother Mary”</i></b> 
    to give birth to Jesus. <span style="color:blue">So we need an educated, 
    gifted and rational&nbsp;leader (prophet) who can lead us to the right path of 
    salvation. Ali is an&nbsp;immensely&nbsp;gifted person; he is exposing the futility of 
    the claimed-to-be truest religion Islam through his bullet-proof rational 
    analysis like nobody else; he is a highly educated person (unlike illiterate 
    bunch of Jesus, Moses and Muhammad) and he is a rationalist to the core - he 
    definitely makes an ideal leader to lead the present-generation rationalist 
    believers to true salvation.</span> And with him have joined great psychic 
    people like Van Praagh who has for long dedicated his life to building 
    people's lives, bringing hope to the desperate and helpless. His stunningly 
    humanist ideology has been clearly spelled out in his <b><i>

line-height:150%">Van Praagh, an illustrious leader in our new-found true 
    religion, has already taken brave steps in building people's life, bringing 
    hopes to the masses. We must extend this slogan further; we must win this 
    battle against the skeptics to save this world. We must continue our sacred 
    duty of building people's life and make every effort to save-guard the 
    humanity from peril designed by the skeptics. We must strengthen our hands 
    and advance our promise (Van Praagh's original one) as follows:</p>

margin-left:.25in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

    They're here to destroy people.&quot; ----&gt; </span></b></i><em><b>
    <span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:150%">Oh like-minded rational 
    people, who seek to save this world, who seek to secure this world for our 
    children, for the future generations, join hands with us. We will defeat 
    those evil skeptics - we need to save this world, we must deliver our duty, 
    our promise.&nbsp;Come join hands and we will destroy them (enemy) and build a 
    world of&nbsp;pure peace and purpose. We will secure our salvation and way to 
    heaven.&quot;</span></b></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">Of course, this solemn call of our <b><i>&quot;new religion&quot;</i></b> 
    has a stunning similarity with what Muhammad may have had pronounced to the 
    people of MEKKA: <br>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">Of course, such similarity has to be there. Indeed, all 
    religions have such similarity. We cannot proof our claims of 
    super-natural/paranormal contacts and experiences scientifically or in a 
    credible way to the skeptics; there has to be certain element of belief in 
    religions and there will always be skeptics&nbsp;unwilling to&nbsp;believe. Without 
    defeating and/or destroying those skeptics, religions can not survive. Van 
    Praagh's purported but abbreviated call of our New Religion is right on 
    target. <b><span style="color:red">We must rally behind Ali and Van Praagh; 
    we have to be prepared for a tough fight</span></b> - else, your life will 
    be destroyed, our hoped will be trampled.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">We have already seen how one of the leading men of our 
    religion is building people's life. We must also consider how much more we 
    can achieve from our new religion. Consider Van Praagh is bringing messages 
    to us from our ancestors.

    Fanatic skeptics may term those messages <b>twaddles</b></a><em><b> </b>
    </em>but they are helping build people’s life, bringing hopes to people. Van 
    Praagh, applying his psychic power, is giving us messages like <b><i>our 
    souls live after death for sure; they also keep their religions there</i></b>. 
    There must be a lot of fighting going on between souls of different 
    religions. This message can be very helpful to us as we leave this world, we 
    can go there prepared&nbsp;-&nbsp;those who will be dying tomorrow as Muslims 
    or&nbsp;Hindus can now go there with well-designed strategy so as to&nbsp;defeat&nbsp;the 
    enemy souls in the battle there. Isn't it a great thing which our generation 
    can already achieve from our <b><i>&quot;fledgling new religion?&quot;</i></b></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">So it is obvious that our religion has already brought great 
    benefits to people on earth. Those twaddles Van Praagh brings from our 
    ancestors’ souls are building people's life. What else, do you want? For 
    example, souls of death kins leave hand-marks on the rice pots for the 
    Chinese which bring hope to them, help build life for the Chinese. Isn’t 
    this a great thing? More benefits come paranormal experiences like that of 
    my own: I got to know my TOEFL score 2 days ahead of time - I needed not 
    wait.&nbsp;Such things can do great service to people in building their lives - 
    don't they? Just consider Ali's mom's experience: <b><i>if given due 
    importance, the unfortunate maid's life could have been saved.</i></b> That 
    could have been a great achievement for humanity - don't you think so? This 
    could have been an excellent example of building people's life; saving 
    people's future. The scope and&nbsp;prospect of <em><b>Rational Spirituality </b>
    </em>is enormous.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">I must agree that in presenting his New Religion, Ali has 
    already made a few mistakes. He says, <i>“Paranormals give you <b>hints</b> 
    only, not precise information when one is awake”.</i> This assertion is 
    thoroughly erroneous. For example, my getting to know the <b><i>TOEFL score</i></b> 
    and Ali’s mom’s seeing a <b><i>“giant falling”</i></b> were experienced when 
    we were sleeping, we were not at all awake. Also my TOEFL score was not at 
    all a hint, it was precise information – I see the exact score in my dream. 
    This cannot be any kind of hints. Hence, Ali must reconsider these points 
    and correct his thesis. Of course, he is new in this business like other 
    religion traders and some mistakes have to happen. We must understand this.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">Today, we know that all age-old religions brought by 
    uneducated, schemy and often cruel people of the distant past are pure lies. 
    We need a religion today, a rational one with no or less lies. We can recall
    <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina40305.htm" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
    “Remote Viewing”</a> claim of our another illustrious comrade
    <a href="http://www.mceagle.com/remote-viewing/pub/news/96dec30-wp.html" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
    psychic McMoneagle</a><span style="color:black"> about an American General’s 
    capture by an Italian terrorist group. That’s another testament of how great 
    benefits our New Religion can bring to mankind. Of course, 20 millions of 
    dollars were later invested on McMoneagle’s “Remote Viewing” project with 
    Zero outcome. McMoneagle must have attempted do “remote viewing” for 
    thousands of times during that 10-year course of the project. That means 
    those thousands of predictions of McMoneagle were pure lies, he lied 
    knowingly. Of course, his claim of having <b><i>psychic power </i></b>was 
    pure lies. So what? All religions are based on lies anyway. But McMoneagle 
    was true at least once, out of his thousands of attempts. This is not a bad 
    thing, not 100% lies on which other religions are based on. Van Praagh also 
    probably lies like McMoneagle. He can only say how Larry King’s dad dies but 
    wouldn’t say <b><i>how my dad might have died.</i></b> Of course, he lies. 
    But all religions are pure lies. Our New Religions can’t just be free of 
    this essential ingredient.</span></p>

    battle</span></b></em></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">My fellow friends, we must rally behind Ali and Van Praagh et 
    al. to&nbsp;establish this fledgling religion&nbsp;firmly on earth. I am encouraged by 
    a few converts already joining hands. We must win this battle against the 
    skeptics who destroy people’s lives. Remind you- they never build lives; 
    they only destroy. Think about this: the skeptics’ camp dominated by the 
    Scientists, Rational Humanists, leading Philosophers etc. have done nothing, 
    absolutely nothing to build people’s lives. They have only brought about all 
    scientific progress; they have contributed enormously for the comfortable, 
    easy and just life in this world. Those are just material things – those 
    contributions don’t build people’s life but instead destroy people’s life 
    and destroys people’s hope. Of course, the skeptics never kill people in 
    great numbers; still we must believe that they destroy people’s life. 
    Although, we rational spiritualists just <b><i>“do twaddles”</i></b> by 
    means of our new religion but they still build people’s life, bring hopes to 
    people. One may wonder if we destroy the skeptics; who is going to keep the 
    wheel of progress of human life rolling. I don’t think we have any problem 
    there at all. Do we remember the fire-ball Ali witnesses in his sister bed 
    room? Ali says that was clearly an intelligent being. It can be presumed 
    that those intelligent beings may be huge gold-mine of genius and 
    intelligence. Once we have established our new religions by destroying the 
    skeptic scientists, philosophers etc., we can replace them with those 
    intelligence beings and the progress of our Spiritual world can even move 
    forward faster.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%">It is our sacred duty now to defeat those <b><i>devious 
    skeptics</i></b> who are hell-bent on destroying people’s life and 
    destroying this world. We must win this all-important battle to hold hopes 
    to our future generations. In this battle, we must make strategic decisions 
    to defeat the skeptics. We must bear in mind that the skeptics today are 
    much more resilient, they are a lot better equipped with the advancement of 
    science, philosophy and human development than they were at the time of 
    Prophet Muhammad, Moses etc. and we must be prepared for more fierce battles 
    than those fought by Muhammad &amp; Moses during their times. In this battle 
    against the skeptic nonbelievers, we will quickly get assistance from other 
    religious groups such as Islam since skeptics are the common enemies to all 
    believers of super-naturals/paranormals. Although believers of any other 
    religions say Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism etc. are all be our 
    ultimate enemies, we must not hesitate to ally with them to exterminate the 
    common enemy, the skeptics. In this case, we can very successfully apply the 
    very clever and crooked strategic decisions Prophet Muhammad made during his 
    battle against the enemies of Islam.</p>
