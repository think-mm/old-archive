    <p align="center"><b>E-mail: <a href="mailto:meekerdb@rain.org">meekerdb@rain.org</a>&nbsp;</b></p>
    <p>Ali Sina defines paranormal events as occurrences outside the scope of
    common experience and inexplicable by current science. By that definition,
    every discovery in science that leads to a new theory would count as
    paranormal. From Sina's examples, it is clear that he means more than this
    by 'paranormal'. He is not thinking of an experiment that shows general
    relativity is wrong or that there is an error in the standard model of
    elementary particles. He means a 'spiritual realm'. Someplace outside our
    experience where 'free will' and 'agency' do things. Where other intelligent
    beings dwell. Powers that can be exercised through pure thought. He objected
    to my explanation of the orange globe of light because he believed it
    'behaved intelligently'.</p>
    <p>He doesn't want us to dismiss this kind of paranormal realm unless we
    have proof. But what kind of proof is demanded? Obviously there cannot be
    deductive proof as in mathematics. That leaves empirical proof. Empirical
    proof cannot be certain, but it can provide high probabliity - as in the
    legal standard of &quot;proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; So what we
    have in this debate is Sina saying you can't dismiss the paranormal unless
    you have proof that all the claims of paranormal events and powers are
    false. Randi is saying I'll believe in a paranormal event when it is
    demonstrated in a controlled environment to rule out cheating and lying. So
    which is the 'rational' position.</p>
    <p>First, let us consider Sina's position. What does he mean by 'dismiss'?
    Does he mean 'not believe'? I don't think so; He writes, &quot;This is no
    proof that paranormal is a reality that should be taken seriously. We have
    no evidence to make such claim.&quot; So he must consider it rational to
    withhold belief in the absence of evidence. So what else can he mean by
    &quot;dismiss&quot;. I think he means not take the effort to investigate. <font color="#000066"><b>He
    thinks that to be 'rational' we should investigate claims of the paranormal.
    But isn't that what Randi proposes to do? Isn't he offering a million
    dollars as an incentive for those who claim to have paranormal powers to
    come forward and confirm their claim.</b></font></p>
    <p>Perhaps Sina has in mind the investigation of claims in the field as
    carried out by Ray Hyman, Joe Nickell, Ralph Estling and other members of
    the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. If
    he would read their publication, &quot;The Skeptical Inquirer&quot; he would
    find that dozens of claims are investigated every year. None however have
    been found to be beyond ordinary explanation. Fraud, mistakes, and
    self-delusion account for most of them. Are some of them unexplained in the
    sense that no single definite explanation is highly probable? - Certainly.
    But just because one cannot rule out all but one mundane explanation doesn't
    mean that a paranormal event has been found.</p>
    <p>So when we hear a claim that, for example, &quot;intricate forms can
    appear on thin ice where no human can walk&quot; how should we rationally
    respond to it. My response would be:</p>
    <p>Where is it? Do you have photos? How do you know that no one could walk
    on the ice? Could they lay on the ice? Could the pattern have been made when
    the ice was thicker? Could a child have done it? A small animal? Can such
    forms be the result of natural processes?</p>
    <p>You see there are many possibilities quite consistent with known science.
    They all seem more probable to me than the action of a supernatural being.
    So, while I would be inclined to investigate such a phenomena if it were
    accessible to investigation, when it is merely a claim that can no longer be
    investigated, I see no reason to give any credence to the theory that it was
    paranormal.</p>
    <p>I note that Ali Sina uses this same standard when it comes to the claims
    of a religion he dislikes. Muslims claim miraculous sights and paranormal
    events all the time. But Mr. Sina dismisses them without investigation. One
    might characterize this as bigotry; but I wouldn't want to stoop to Mr.
    Sina's tactic of calling my fellow debater names like liar, arrogant, bogus
    or insincere while flattering myself that I am not rude.</p>
    <p><b>Now consider Randi's position. He doesn't credence reports of
    paranormal powers. He knows that people are easily fooled and, as Richard
    Feynman observed, the easiest person for you to fool is yourself. But he
    doesn't dismiss them either. He investigates them. Not just by trying to get
    those who claim paranormal powers to come and demonstrate them.</b> He also
    travels all over the world to investigate such claims. He has tested water
    dowsers, psychics, aura readers, and magic healers all over the world. They
    have all failed. Their failures are documented on video tape - not just
    reported as antecdotes. <font color="#FF0000"><b>Has Ali Sina investigated
    all those claims he says shouldn't be dismissed? - or has he simply settled
    comfortably into believing in a 'spirit realm' and not wanting to
    investigate lest the world prove less magical than he hopes.</b></font>
    There are plenty of antecdotes to feed those who want to believe - religions
    make them up by the thousands.</p>
