          You also wrote about James Randi’s credential. He might be famous (I
          do not claim to know all the famous people). I have a hunch that his
          million dollar mental stunt had something to do with his fame. However
          the fact that he is famous does not make him right. This is a logical
          fallacy and is called “appeal to authority”. Because X is an
          authority, it does not mean X is right all the time.</font></td>

  Actually I wrote about Randi because you said you did not hear his name. I
  just gave you some information about him and his work. Of course he may be
  wrong, just as you can be. That was not the point at that time. For me no one
  is the ultimate authority. So &quot;appeal to authority&quot; is misplaced
  here, in my opinion.<br>

          That is what I believe too. However, Randi is not saying this. He is
          saying psychic power does not exist and ALL those who claim to have
          psychic power are fake or hallucinating things. Randi’s position is
          not that of skepticism but of faith. His million dolalre offer is
          proof that he is denying such thing exists at all. I have no problem
          with his doubts. I have problem with his faith.</font></td>

    </tbody>

  <span class="postbody"><br>
  <br>
  This is the crux of the problem. Unfortunately I consider your position is
  more gullible than Randi's. Consider the following occurrences:<br>
  <br>
  <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Psychics don't rely on psychics to warn them
  of impending disasters. All they do is like those finders of Quranic miracles:
  whenever the modern science find something, they hurriedly try to relate with
  ambiguous Quranic verses. Consider that Psychics cant even predict their own
  deaths or diseases. They go to the dentist or doctors like the rest of us. I
  know one famous Bangladeshi psychic healer went to USA for his better
  treatment of his disease. They're as surprised and disturbed as the rest of us
  when they have to call a plumber or an electrician to fix some defect at home.
  Their planes are delayed without their being able to anticipate the delays. If
  they want to know something about Abraham Lincoln, they go to the library;
  they don't try to talk to Abe's spirit. In short, psychics live by the known
  laws of nature except when they are playing the psychic game with people.
  Psychics aren't overly worried about other psychics reading their minds and
  revealing their innermost secrets to the world. No casino has ever banned
  psychics from the gaming room because there is no need. No lottery number is
  ever predicted by any psychic. How can we be sure that psychic power really
  exists?</span><br>
  <br>
  Infact many a times we saw that the claim of accuracy of psychic predictions
  is grossly overrated. The belief in the accuracy of clairvoyants such as Edgar
  Cayce and Jeanne Dixon is due to several factors, including mass media error
  and hype. For example, it has been repeatedly reported in the mass media that
  Jeanne Dixon predicted the assassination of President Kennedy. Actually She
  did not. The New York Times at that time helped spread the myth that Edgar
  Cayce transformed from an illiterate into a healer when hypnotized. One of the
  more egregious cases of mass media complicity in promoting belief in psychics
  is the case of &quot;psychic&quot; Tamara Rand, producer Dick Maurice, and
  talk show host Gary Grecco of KNTV in Las Vegas. All conspired to deceive the
  public by claiming that a video tape of a &quot;Dick Maurice Show,&quot; on
  which Rand predicts the assassination attempt by John Hinkley on Ronald
  Reagan, was done on January 6, 1981. The tape was actually made on March 31,
  1991, a day after Hinkley shot Reagan (Steiner).<br>
  <br>
  So what should we common people do? Believe those all charlatans who claims
  mystic power? Dont you think we should follow the path of skepticism rather
  than blind faith in abnormal phenomenon? In fact, I find it quite reasonable
  to use as a guide when an implausible, incredible claim the advice of David
  Hume and Thomas Huxley: ask yourself what is more likely, that the claim is
  true or that one making the claim deceived, in error or intentionally trying
  to deceive you? And another quote for you:</span>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="postbody"><i>&quot;When a confidential information leaks out
    of an Organization, people suspect a spy, not a psychic&quot; -<b> John
    Allen Paulos.</b><br>
    </i><br>

    <br>

      <tr>
        <td class="quote"><font color="#0066CC">Also Randi’s challenge is not
          a strong argument at all. It goes to say that Randi has no clue about

  <br>
  Well I found it rather opposite. In this gullible world, Randi is making a
  significant and bold step towards rationalism. If you think that you are a
  mental spoon bender, you can't use your own spoons. If you are going to see
  auras, you will have to do so under controlled conditions. If you are going to
  do some remote viewing, you will not be given credit for coming close in some
  vague way. If you are going to demonstrate your dowsing powers, be prepared to
  be tested under controlled conditions. If you are going to do psychic surgery,
  expect to have cameras watching your every move. Don't you think those are the
  common rational steps one should follow instead of starting believing in a
  psychic power? Of course that wont disregard the possibility of existence of
  psychic power, but what is the problem if someone wants to test the claims
  before believing dogmatically? That's not what you also do when someone claims
  for &quot;Quranic miracles&quot; or Muhammad's unexplained journey to heaven
  thru meraj?<br>
  <br>
  Why Randi' is important for us ? Because he is a famous magician. He knows the
  basic tricks of fake psychics better than us. He can see those events more
  critically (Just as Ali and his FFI folks sees Quranic miracles critically
  than common gullible Muslims) . Charlatans, fakirs, mystics, and dreamers
  alike, they are all too aware that James Randi's meticulously-devised tests
  can destroy their reputations, such as they are, and make fools of them all.
  It is easy to fool common people who does not have any expertise on
  tricks/magic, even famous scientists are also included! I know Indian
  Rationalist Association debunked one so-called Rusian psychic, who used to
  claim recognition of his power from some famous scientist community of his
  country.<br>
  <br>
  Anyways, The following is a sampling of other grumblings in response to
  Randi's challenge:<br>
  <br>
  -- I can't afford to be in a higher tax bracket.<br>
  -- I'm already rich.<br>
  -- I don't want the money; I'm totally spiritual.<br>
  -- You wouldn't pay me the money, anyway.<br>
  -- It's all a lie; there is no prize.<br>
  -- It's a trap by the CIA to identify and murder me.<br>
  -- The prize comes from the CIA (or from the communists).<br>
  -- God told me not to get into it.<br>
  -- If I win, you'll have me killed to save the money.<br>
  -- You'll put out negative vibes to inhibit my powers.<br>
  -- Since you're a trickster, you'll fool me somehow.<br>
  -- It's too much money.<br>
  -- It's not enough money.<br>
  -- I want the money in a pile, in cash, (or a certified check) before I try.<br>
  <br>
  Any clue, why??? :-)<br>

  That's good. You are now approaching to reality. In fact, there are some
  &quot;honest Psychics&quot; who are at least honest about their deception and
  inability and call themselves mentalists and call their art magic or
  conjuring.. Yet, it is the &quot;real psychics,&quot; not the mentalists, who
  are the darlings of the mass media. Thus, when the mass media promote
  &quot;psychics&quot; for their entertainment or news value, they are either
  promoting fraud or encouraging delusions. Perhaps the media think that because
  most parties in the psychic game are consenting adults, that makes it okay.
  Perhaps the police agree and that is why telepsychics like Miss Cleo can
  practice without fear of arrest for fraudulently claiming to have psychic
  powers. If you say psychic does not have any power to perform all the time,
  then it is contradictory to ur previous stand. You mentioned about Van
  Praagh's performance in Larry King TV show in favor of the existence of his
  psychic power. <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">How Van Praagh was so sure that
  he could successfully perform in a TV show with some miraculous prediction
  regarding Larry King's father</span>, but NOT in front of Randi? One may
  wonder...<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Lastly, about one comment:<br>
  <br>

        <td><span class="genmed"><b><font color="#0066CC">Ali Sina:</font></b></span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="quote"><font color="#0066CC">This is exactly the religious
          attitude I claimed the pseudo rationalists share with the

  We can go beyond such stereotyping, Ali. If someone challenges on something
  from his confidence and experience on a valid issue, it is not worthwhile to
  compare it with Muhammad's &quot;Produce a sura....&quot; on sole purpose to
  ridicule it. If someone disagrees with ur view it does not mean that he is
  talking like a Muslim or a religionist. You might be wrong too, just as
  everybody.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">BTW, for interested general readers who
  believes in psychic power:</span><br>
  <br>
  The <a href="http://www.randi.org/">James Randi Educational Foundation</a>
  offers a prize of $1,000,000 to anyone who can prove he or she has a psychic
  ability. After collecting the million from Randi, successful psychics can also
  contact B. Premanand of the Indian Skeptic, another magician and debunker of
  paranormal who will pay 100,000 rupees (ca. $2,300) &quot;to any person or
  persons who will demonstrate any psychic, supernatural of paranormal ability
  of any kind under satisfactory observing conditions.&quot; &quot;Mr. Prabir
  Ghosh will pay 20,00,000 rupees to anyone who claims to possess supernatural
  power of any kind and proves the same without restoring to any trick in the
  location specified by Prabir Ghosh.&quot; Also, the Australian Skeptics will
  throw in an additional $100,000 (Australian), $80,000 for the psychic and
  $20,000 for anyone &quot;who nominates a person who successfully completes the
  Australian Skeptics Challenge.&quot; Some good opportunities indeed!!! If you
  nominate yourself, and are successful, you get the whole hundred grand.<br>
  <br>
  Take care.<br>
