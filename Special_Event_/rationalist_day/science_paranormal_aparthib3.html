      &quot;You say &quot;Brent meant one can be irrational but still NOT

      be irrational if he is not dogmatic..&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>APARTHIB-1:&nbsp;</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You are missing the basic notions of logic. The meaning of the
      statement &quot;dichotomy between dogmatism and rationalism is
      false.&quot; means that it is not necessarily true that if someone is not
      dogmatic he must be rational, or that if someone is irrational then he
      must be dogmatic. There can be a third possibility, e.g uncritical
      credulity, which is neither rational nor dogmatic. Not being dogmatic is
      not the ONLY criteria for being rational. Rationalism pre-requires lot
      more than just not being dogmatic in religion, politics etc. A general
      skepticism is ALSO a requirement. So it is possible for someone to be not
      dogmatic about religion YET be irrational, when any of the other
      prerequisites for rationality are not met (e.g one prerequisite being not believing
      in any claims of truth without objective evidence). An a priori belief in
      the paranormal occurrence due to anecdotes may not be a dogma, like the
      belief in religion or communist dogma, but it is still not consistent with
      rationalism (i.e skepticism), because OBJECTIVE EVIDENCES (A prerequisite
      for a scientific belief) are not yet available for the occurrence
      paranormals. I can't clarify it in any more foolproof way. I am lost as to
      why you find this simple truth so difficult to grasp. By the way I would
      like to mention however that Dark matter is an example of something whose
      existence has been verified by objective evidence but has not been
      explained scientifically in a satisfactory way. Now here is a case of
      paranormal! that is recognized by scientists. Will you still complain Ali?

      <p>Please stare at your own observation VERY closely. Your last two
      sentences are correct. In fact your last two sentences reflect the view of
      Brent, myself, Randi or any rationalist/skeptic. But your first statement
      &quot;Brent is mistaken&quot; does not follow from the last two sentences,
      because Brent's statement does not contradict your last two propositions
      (Stare again). What Brent said should really have been phrased more
      accurately (Which is obvious from the context) as: (added words are in
      CAPS)</p>
      <p>&quot;The opposite of dogmatic denial isn't NECESSARILY rationality; it
      COULD BE uncritical credulity.&quot;</p>
      <p>So Brent meant that if one dogmatically denies the paranormal (Like
      Randi et al, as you would allege), then the opposites of Randi et al, i.e
      those who do not dogmatically deny paranormal, need not necessarily be
      rational (i.e skeptic), they could be uncritical believers in paranormal.
      Uncritical belief in paranormal is certainly not consistent with
      skepticism. There is YET no evidence for a critical belief in paranormal.
      SO any belief in the paranormal has to be uncritical at this point. Can I
      make it any more foolproof, anyone?</p>

      thing. &quot;Opposing violence&quot; is not the same thing as
      &quot;violently opposing&quot;. When I used &quot;dogmatic denial&quot; I
      meant denying the facts and the evidence dogmatically.</font></p>

    <p><b>APARTHIB-3:&nbsp;</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>You failed to grasp the semantics again Sina. You need to hone up on critical
      thinking a bit more. Brent meant &quot;Dogmatic denial&quot; in exactly
      the same way as you meant. He was borrowing your expression to describe
      Brent, Randi and other &quot;pseudo-rationalists&quot;, who YOU think
      &quot;dogmatically deny&quot; the paranormal. He did not use the
      expression &quot;denial of dogmatism&quot; here, because he did not mean
      that either. He clearly used the expression in the same sense as you are
      using. So why this confusion. All he is saying that if &quot;Ali Sina is
      opposed to dogmatic denial of paranormal, which (i.e dogmatic denial) Ali
      Sina claims Brent and Randi and others do (i.e dogmatically deny
      paranormal), then Ali Sina is not being necessarily rational, he is
      uncritically credulous of paranormal claims&quot;. Another foolproof
      clarification. By the way a belief based on anything but objective
      evidence is &quot;uncritical&quot; by definition.</p>

      <p>Your analogy is misplaced. The &quot;body&quot; of a man is not a

      police officer is not denying the EXISTENCE of the body as a concept, nor
      is the existence of the body an undefined concept. In the paranormal case
      the meaning of &quot;existence&quot; (existence of WHAT?) itself is in
      doubt. That's the crucial difference. Skeptic or the police neither are
      ridiculing the act of narrating anecdotal experience. There is also a
      limit to which you can push the analogy. A crime investigation involves
      well defined objects and notions amenable to sense perceptions, and there
      is a moral urgency to reach the most reasonable verdict for justice to the
      victim, based on anecdotes and circumstantial evidence. There is no such
      moral urgency in paranormal (A) because there is no victim of any crime
      needing justice (B) Paranormal claims involve notions/objects that are not

      <p>Again strawman fallacy. Materialism is not the accurate word for true
      scientists and skeptics. No &quot;ism&quot; is embraced by science and
      rationalism. Materialism is an old school philosophical term that is
      obsolete now. Science is applied rationalism. Whatever logic and evidences
      leads to one is what is considered best representation of reality to a
      scientist. Materialism, spiritualism is not the right word to describe
      that. Scientists can care less what they are called. All that matters is
      the scientific method. It is a public endeavor. Nothing esoteric. No
      &quot;ism&quot; involved here. If objective evidence leads to the
      occurrence of a paranormal event, scientists will be the happiest camper.
      Science thrives on unanswered questions, mysteries. Besides scientists and
      skeptics are human too, with emotions. They would also wish that there be
      some reality beyond what has been observed so far. Nothing to lose, if it
      DOES exist, only to gain. But is has to be first proven to exist. Personal
      conviction is not proof in science. It is the mental leap of skeptical
      scientist where they learn to even doubt themselves (not the experience,
      but the EXPLANATION or interpretation of it) that sets them apart. By the
      way I did write in one of my &quot;Science and Metaphysics&quot; series in
      Mukto-Mona there are already some genuine paranormals in science as well.
      Dark matter is one of them as I pointed out earlier in this response. It
      EXISTS! But its satisfactory explanation is not known yet. They are not
      unhappy because of admitting that this paranormal exists :).</p>
