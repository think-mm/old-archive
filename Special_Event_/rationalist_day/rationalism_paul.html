    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I concur with everything that your three responders (Randi, Meeker and
    Aparthib) said. They have spoken on my behalf.</p>
    <p>In addition, I would like to specifically concur with Aparthib who said:</p>
    <p><i>&quot;For example if some one affirms that science WILL explain
    everything, that is not a statement from science. It is a personal
    conviction. It may be true, or may not be.&quot;</i></p>
    <p>When I said:</p>
    <p>&quot;Ali, there's a scientific explanation for all these things, even if
    you don't immediately know it.&quot;</p>
    <p>that was more a throwaway line to tempt Ali to refute it, a process
    during which I was hoping he would find himself chasing his own tail and
    give up the chase. It WAS possible to refute it, but only as Aparthib
    pointed out.</p>
    <p>I was hoping that Ali would come back and tell me that I was not
    open-minded enough, and tell me that although it is DISTINCTLY POSSIBLE that
    science could explain everything, as almost every phenomena we had seen to
    date was able to be explained, there was no absolute guarantee of that into
    the future.</p>
    <p>Basically this argument:</p>
    <p>&quot;It may be dogma like statement but is strictly not a dogma to state
    that since science has been able to explain many phenomena that were
    previously unexplainable, science possibly can explain all phenomena.&quot;</p>
    <p>At which point I would have been quite happy to &quot;give in&quot; and
    admit that he was right, there is still the possibility of paranormal-type
    phenomena to exist, even though there wasn't a scrap of evidence of anything
    paranormal here in reality, TO DATE.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately Ali wasn't inspired to move in that direction.</p>
    <p>If I had known my statement would appear as a point of debate, I may have
    just stuck to the easy argument, which was to argue about Praagh and get him
    to realize he was as wrong about Praagh as religious people are about Gods.
    Those arguments are like shooting rats in barrels - my peers have done all
    the leg-work and a simple google search provides all the evidence of fraud
    required. In this case, it even has a name, &quot;cold reading&quot;.</p>

    <p>I do not know why Ali did not find those links convincing. Perhaps for
    some people, the paranormal takes over when religion is abandoned, so that
    the world is a more interesting place, and that there is still hope that
    when we die, we will still have plenty of opportunity to talk to psychics,
    rather than the more unpalatable alternative (don't click, trust me):</p>

    <p>I think part of the problem is just getting terminology correct.</p>
    <p>Basically, it appears that he would e.g. call the northern lights
    paranormal while waiting many centuries for the scientific explanation to
    arrive.</p>
    <p>I think this needs to be defined properly, even before we start getting
    into the blind faith in the occult (presumably to make the world seem more
    interesting). Personally, what I find makes the world interesting is
    skeptics (like Randi's million dollar challenge), that completely demolish
    these myths.</p>
    <p>I take inspiration from those who spent the effort to find &quot;bible
    codes&quot; in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. To be able to do a google search and
    suddenly get these answers (after a religious person told me about
    &quot;bible codes&quot;), completely blows my mind away. And I have directed
    people where to go to get a quick million dollars from too.</p>

    <p>N.B. In case you're wondering, I'm the friend Ali refers to in his
    article.</p>
