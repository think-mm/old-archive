    <p><b><i>Rationalism</i></b> as a philosophy is defined as using reason and 
    logic as the reliable basis for testing any claims of truth, seeking 
    objective knowledge about reality, making judgments and drawing conclusions 
    about it. Although rationalism must ultimately rely on sense perceptions, 
    but it must also couple sense perceptions with logic and evidence. To be 
    consistent with logic, the thought process of a rationalist must be free 
    from logical fallacies, catalogued in many introductory books on logic or 
    critical thinking. There is no place for personal bias or emotion in 
    rationalism, although emotion and rationalism are not mutually exclusive, 
    each has its place. More on this later. <b><i>Freethinking</i></b>, which is 
    sometimes confused with rationalism, is defined as the free forming of views 
    about reality independent of authority or dogma, be it from a divine or 
    human source. If we stick to the strict definitions, then freethinking is 
    not synonymous with rationalism. One need not be strictly rational to be a 
    freethinker. One is allowed the leeway to believe or form any opinion, not 
    necessarily rational (essentially &quot;think as you like&quot;), as long as it is not 
    influenced by existing religious, cultural or traditional dogma or 
    authority. A postmodernist (Read intellectual anarchist) may claim to be a 
    freethinker according to this non-restrictive definition. But rationalism is 
    much more restrictive. It enforces logic and evidence as the guiding 
    principle in thinking and forming opinions and cognition. So <b>although 
    rationalism invariably leads to freethinking, but freethinking does not 
    necessarily imply rationalism</b>, since freethinking may include irrational 
    views, beliefs and personal bias. I have attempted to provide my own 
    definitions in a precise way in a recent post (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/5924" target="_blank">Faith 
    Philosophy and Dogma</a>) to help set the criteria for 
    freethinkers/freethinking. </p>
    <p>I must point out that I have tried to define and explain rationalism in 
    the sense it is commonly understood today. I have not tried to approach the 
    concept of rationalism from the perspective of the history of philosophy. In 
    philosophical literature rationalism have been historically used to mean a 
    certain epistemological school. The epistemic rationalism of Des Cartes, 
    Spinozza, Wolff, Leibnitz et alia postulated that human knowledge is 
    attainable apriori through intellect alone, independent of senses. To them 
    the true source of knowledge were innate ideas. Sense perception to them was 
    a poor or incomplete source of knowledge. Rationalism was in contrast with 
    empiricism, whose principal proponents were Locke, Hume, Berkeley et alia. 
    But my definition of rationalism is, in my view more meaningful, pragmatic 
    and consistent with contemporary scientific thinking. </p>
    <p>Rationalism as a philosophy demands some strict mental discipline that 
    many find hard to implement in their thoughts and actions. Many may not even 
    be aware that they are not being strictly rational. The reason for this is 
    that some mistakenly associate rationalism with certain ideals and outlook 
    that do not necessarily follow from rationalism. Rationalism as a philosophy 
    inevitably leads to scientific method through logic and critical thinking. 
    Therefore a rationalist cannot subscribe a priori to any ideology, political 
    or ideological, nor can a rationalist make statement of truth that is not a 
    strict proposition. So <b>a rationalist cannot claim to be a strict atheist, 
    i.e cannot assert that &quot;God does not exist&quot;, since God is not a logically 
    well-defined and meaningful concept, all definitions of God in any religious 
    context runs into contradictions and logical inconsistency.
    <font color="#ff0000" style="line-height: 1.35em">So the existence or 
    non-existence of God are both logically meaningless to a rationalist.</font></b> 
    A rationalist can only take a <b>noncognitivist</b> position in the God 
    context. <span class="postbody">For more details <br>

    </span>Does it mean a rationalist cannot have any opinion at all about 
    anything? Of course not. If an opinion does not contradict logic, evidence 
    or observation, rationalism does not prevent one from forming a tentative 
    opinion. <b>For example it is not against rationalism to hypothesize about 
    all the POSSIBLE causes of a crime, when definite evidence is missing to 
    point to the actual cause. Same can be said about theories to explain 
    certain facts of reality. That's what science is about. Scientific 
    speculation is just that.</b> Theories are just possible explanation about 
    facts and observations. Before theories can become laws they are just 
    scientific opinions. But the important point to realize is that rationalist 
    opinions, although not yet proven, should nevertheless be consistent with 
    logic or observations (i.e does not contradict logic or observations) and 
    should not use ill-defined terms. <b>Rationalism cannot be a basis for 
    subscribing to a political party based on any dogma, or to express an <i>a 
    priori</i> affiliation or support for a non-dogma based political party.</b>. 
    One can certainly do so as a <i>human</i> out of emotional need or bias, but 
    not DUE TO rationalism. For a rationalist who chooses to be guided by pure 
    rationalism, not emotion, support for a non-dogma based political party 
    should be based on policies, performance, efficiencies and other objective 
    criterion, thus need not be a static one, but changeable based on an ongoing 
    assessment of the fulfillment of those criteria. There is no such concept as 
    party loyalty in a rationalist vocabulary. Some intellectuals believe that 
    certain political stand in an ideological, social or political controversy 
    is required by rationalism, e.g leftist ideology, pro-choice stand in 
    abortion, nurturist stand in nature-nurture debate, etc to name a few. Many 
    of them commit the fallacy of appeal to emotion (invoking 
    patriotism/nationalism) to justify an uncritical adoption of one side of a 
    political issue. <b>To a rationalist, an apriori biased stand is not 
    consistent with rationalism. They should be prepared to accept whichever 
    viewpoint that scientific and logical reasoning may lead to, even if that 
    goes against the popular trend of thinking.</b> <b>
    <font color="#ff0000" style="line-height: 1.35em">Rationalism is ruthless, 
    it does not need to pamper to one's emotional need or wishes, or care about 
    political correctness.</font></b>. In personal life, that means a 
    rationalist has to acknowledge and be critical of the unpleasant facts, if 
    necessary, about one's near and dear ones, if evidence so suggests. Being 
    able to separate facts from personal biases is an essential hallmark of 
    rationalism. By the same token, a rationalist has to acknowledge, and 
    criticize , if need be, the shortcomings of the race, religion or language 
    he/she belongs to, in a detached way, free from personal bias, as well as 
    acknowledge the superiority of another race, religion in a certain aspect, 
    if objective evidence suggests so. Rationalism also does not imply making an 
    a priori assumption that all bad or wrongs are equal, just because political 
    correctness says so. Rationalism demands doing the required homework to 
    quantify and recognize shades in right and wrong in morality and shades of 
    good and bad in attributes by some objective criteria when applicable. This 
    requires intellectual courage and integrity, as it can be potentially incur 
    one the scorn of the majority, for whom the priority is loyalty, pride, 
    patriotism etc. But rationalism does not recognize such mental constructs or 
    sets such priority. It only cares for logic and evidence. <b>Rationalism 
    does not allow taking a stand just because it is politically correct or 
    popular. </b>Many intellectuals associate the terms liberal, progressive etc 
    with rationalism/freethinking. But liberal, progressive etc are usually 
    understood and judged in the context of which stand one takes vis a vis 
    certain issues, e.g pro-choice in abortion, leftist ideology ij politics, 
    nurturist stand in the nature/nurture debate, a puritanic belief that all 
    bads are equal (i.e cultural and moral relativism) etc. But rationalism does 
    not require one to adopt such positions, and in fact in certain issues,\ may 
    lead to the opposite stand by scientific evidence and logic. I will not 
    dwell at length on the specifics of those scientific evidences in all such 
    cases as it is a topic on its own and I am only interested on the general 
    aspects of rationalism in this essay. A small example may help to illustrate 
    rationalistic approach to an issue. IF we adopt the axiom that ending a 
    &quot;life&quot; is morally wrong, THEN the act of abortion by definition will be 
    morally wrong, since biology tells us that a fetus has life of its own. 
    There is no value judgement involved, that was a conclusion derived from 
    purely logical inference. (Notice the IF.. THEN.. construct). Whether we 
    should adopt &quot;ending life is morally wrong&quot; as an axiom of course is not 
    dictated by rationalism. But in fact we can derive that axiom from 
    rationalism if we adopt another axiom as more fundamental, for example the 
    axiom that we should do whatever is needed to increases the odds for the 
    survival of human species. In that case rational thinking using evolutionary 
    biology tells us that IF we adopt the precept &quot;ending life is morally 
    wrong&quot;, THEN it increases the odds for the survival of human species (Again 
    notice the IF.. THEN.. contruct). Whether we should consider &quot;increasing the 
    odds of the survival of human species&quot; as a moral imperative is of course 
    beyond rationalism. This is an intuitive moral axiom. This example clearly 
    shows that rationalism does have a role in formulating moral precpets, 
    barring the mosr primitive moral axioms. Even humanism, is not strictly 
    derived from rationalism. Humanism follows from rationalism if the postulate 
    &quot;we should put priority on the welfare of maximum number of humans 
    irrespective of race, color, creed, ethnicity etc.&quot; is added to rationalism. 
    It must be noted that all religions and dogmas claim human welfare as their 
    goal as well. But what differentiates their view of humanism from rational 
    humanism is that for them, that goal is claimed to be achievable only 
    through the implementation of their dogma. So dogma comes first for them. 
    Not only that, the priority for welfare in most religions and dogmas is 
    reserved for their followers. But rational humanism does not make that 
    distinction. Once humanism is arrived through rationalism, the notions of 
    democracy and secularism follows as corollary.</p>
    <p>Symbolically:&nbsp;<br>
    <b><font color="#008000" style="line-height: 1.35em">Rationalism+Human 
    good--&gt; Humanism--&gt; Democracy--&gt;Secularism</font></b></p>
    <p>Another point that many may have already wondered is that how can we 
    decide who is rationalist or not? After all, followers of all religion or 
    dogma claim they believe in logic and reason. Doesn't every one have their 
    own logic and every religion their own logic? So how can one not be 
    rational? This is a tricky question that can lead to a slippery slope if not 
    clarified beforehand. Cultural and moral relativists, postmodernists exploit 
    such slippery slope to argue that all are equal, nothing is more valid than 
    another etc. The logic and evidence referred to in rationalism, is shared by 
    humanity with an overwhelming consensus crossing race, religion and 
    affiliation etc. In other words they are universal. Modern logic finds much 
    in common with the logic of early Greek, Hindu and Buddhist philosophers, as 
    well as the early Muslim rationalists (Mutazillites) during the time of the 
    House of Wisdom in Bagdad. This logic has been perfected and improved by 
    later philosophers, like Locke, Hume, Kant and many Mathematicians and 
    logicians of the twentieth century. This is the logic that is taught with 
    tax payer's funding in public schools in most nations of the world as well 
    as secular private schools. This is also the logic that has WORKED. This 
    logic has been the basis of the scientific method that has been so 
    successful, has changed the world, made predictions about nature that was 
    tested and verified to be true. It is also leading humanity towards 
    continued advancement. It is no surprise that this is the logic that people 
    have staked their money in teaching and learning. There are a set of 
    unambiguous rules for valid logical reasoning, both informal and formal 
    taught in elementary logic class that can act as guide to resolve dilemmas, 
    ambiguities, paradox. contradictions, disputes etc. Also it is important to 
    note that claims must be backed up by not just logic, but evidence and 
    objectivity as well, both of are lacking in claims of religious or other 
    dogmas. Contrast that with the &quot;logic&quot; that person &quot;A&quot; uses to rationalize 
    his own belief, or the &quot;logic&quot; of religion &quot;X&quot; to rationalize that religion. 
    Such &quot;logic&quot; is not shared universally, nor has it demonstrated its utility 
    by coming up with any predictions, inventions or innovations, nor to the 
    discovery of any fundamental truth about nature or reality. A &quot;logic&quot; that 
    has been invented as a dedicated ploy to justify one dogma or belief is no 
    logic at all. Besides such logic does not have universal appeal.</p>
    <p>It should suffice to note that a dogma by definition is not based on 
    logic and evidence, so to try to justify a dogma by logic is a fallacy to 
    begin with and thus contrary to rationalism. It is quite intriguing to see 
    vocal champions of religious dogmas even among some PhD's of reputed 
    universities, who are not ashamed to claim that their belief is supported by 
    logic and evidence! </p>
    <p>Rationalism also implies skepticism. <b><i>Skepticism</i></b> requires 
    one to doubt any claim to truth, unless proven by evidence and logic, and to 
    suspend belief or judgment in absence thereof, which clearly follows from 
    rationalism. In personal life, such skepticism forces one to refrain from 
    forming judgement or drawing hasty conclusions or opinion about a person or 
    any claim of truth. In the absence of any evidence or logic a skeptic should 
    stay in a &quot;do nothing&quot; i.e neutral mode. This &quot;do nothing&quot; neutral mode is a 
    level most minds cannot recognize and needs some effort to become at ease 
    with it. Most feel tempted to ruch to an opinion one way or the other, even 
    in the absence of any supporting data. If and when the evidence or logic is 
    available only then a skeptic can form an opinion, that is dictated by the 
    evidence and logic, not by their wishful desires or biases. <b>
    <font color="#ff0000" style="line-height: 1.35em">A rationalist has to have 
    the intellectual courage to acknowledge unpleasant truths. A rationalist 
    never gained/gains materially or otherwise by being rational. It is just a 
    philosophy that they find intuitively appealing.</font></b></p>
    <p><span class="postbody">Let me now turn to some mistaken notions about 
    rationalism that is quite common among many. Many think that rationalism 
    means an arrogant claim to infallibility, that rationalism never admits of 
    ever being wrong, that it denies the possibility that logic itself may be 
    wrong! All these are due to a lack of careful reflection. First that one 
    could be wrong is a trivial and self-evident fact. It is like saying that 
    one cannot be sure that he/she will make it to the destination as the flight 
    may crash. ACKNOWLEDGING that fact of the limits and uncertainties in one's 
    knowledge is a matter of humility. Humility is a personality trait. <b>
    Rationalism is a philosophy, not a trait. Rationalism does not prevent one, 
    nor does it mandate one to possess certain personality trait.</b> Second to 
    say that &quot;logic&quot; itself may be wrong is to commit a fallacy. Because to 
    judge something as &quot;wrong&quot; needs a logic of its own. One cannot use logic to 
    judge the same logic as wrong! We have assumed that there exists only one 
    system of logic that works best. Until we find a better system of logic, it 
    is a fallacy to judge that logic as wrong. But saying that the &quot;logic&quot; is 
    not wrong does not mean saying that one cannot make mistakes. Mistakes are 
    due to an individual's limit or flaw in applying logic, not due to logic 
    itself. But&nbsp;there&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;better way to&nbsp;overcome&nbsp;that&nbsp;limit than&nbsp;logic itself. 
    Anyway, that humility of admitting the self-evident fact of fallibility is 
    built in the scientific method. <b>Scientific method, which is derived from 
    rationalism is based on the premise that there is no absolute or final 
    truth, and that any conclusion about reality is always tentative, subject to 
    continual revision in light of further evidence. But one must not conclude 
    that just because in certain instance one could predict the truth correctly 
    by non-rational (intuition, guess) means that means intuition is superior to 
    rationalism as a means for seeking truth.</b> For example if a coin is 
    tossed, an intuitionist may intuitively guess that the coin will come heads 
    up. A rationalist cannot predict the outcome on the basis of logic and 
    science (It is incredibly complex calculation) If the coin does fall heads 
    up, does it prove that intuition is superior to rationalism? Of course not.
    </p>
    <p>Let me now clarify what rationalism is not or cannot It is a mistaken to 
    believe that rationalism can solve all problems in life, or prevent them. It 
    cannot. The fact it cannot is because the truth in many situation in life is 
    not always known in advance for one to make the right decision. Rationalism 
    is limited by the knowledge or truth that is needed in making an informed 
    decision to solve or prevent a problem. In an indeterminstic situation 
    intuitive guesses and judgement is inevitable. And the intuition of rational 
    person is not guaranteed to be right. So in those situations in life where 
    there are unknowns and uncertainties, intuitive guesswork cannot be avoided. 
    Rationalism may offer some guidelines in making the best guesses, but it 
    cannot offer a guarantee for success. For example, rationalism cannot 
    guarantee one will make the right choice in marriage or relationship. 
    Rationalism cannot prevent one from making mistakes in life. Gamble in life 
    cannot be totally averted through rationalism. Risk cannot be either. More 
    generally speaking, from an utilitarian point of view, rationalism is no 
    guarantee to material success in individual life. Rationalism is a principle 
    based on logic and evidence. In an imperfect world, that is not always the 
    sure route to material success. Just like honesty is not. But the value of 
    rationalism goes beyond personal gains or interests. <b>It's value lies in 
    the collective imnprovement of the quality of human life by following 
    rationalistic approach</b>. COnsider the cost human society has paid and is 
    paying in terms of dollars and man hours for believing in dogmas and faiths 
    that have no logic or evodence as its basis. How much time and resources are 
    being spent towards relgiouis rituals, how much suffering and persecution 
    has enforcement of some cruelst relgious dogmas brought to many decent 
    humans? If majority of a society adopt rationalism as their personal 
    philosophy, then such wastage and social evils could be abolished or 
    minimized. Society would prosper faster then. A common thinking is that 
    morality is beyond rationalism. I think that is a mistaken view. Although 
    the moral axioms at the bottom of a moral system may have to be assumed 
    arbitrarily based on intuition, once the axioms are accepted, further moral 
    precepts based on those axioms can certainly be rationally analyzed or 
    developed. Rationalism is the product of human mind. So is morality. There 
    is no apriori cause for them to be not connected. In the ultimate analysis 
    since it is the laws of nature that has created human brain and thus 
    rationalism, so it should be in principle possible to formulate a moral 
    system based on the same laws of nature via rationalism. It may have to be 
    an evolutionary process. </p>
    <p>It must also be emphasized that not all human brains are equally capabale 
    of rationalism or programmed for rational thinking. There is no guaranatee 
    that rationalism can be inculcated by preaching or training. Human brain, 
    being inherently complex, have varying degrees of potential for each type of 
    thinking. It is possible certain brains are more susceptible to certain cues 
    that triggers rational thinking, while others are impervious to any cues. 
    For example for Aroj Ali Matubbor, the legendary rationalist farmer of rural 
    Bangladesh, the cue that brought out his latent rationalist mind was the 
    event involving taking the picture of his mother's burial. On the other hand 
    some PhD's of reputed US universties, even after being exposed to some of 
    the finest rationalistic arguments, writings and philosophical essays, 
    continue to defend religious dogmas, sometimes even using the very same 
    rationalistic arguments and languages they read about! They are impervious 
    to any rational cues at all. The majority of humans who are in between, are 
    easily susceptible to cues of dogmatist preaching or rationalist thinking. 
    They are up for grabs, so to speak. These are the fence-sitters, swing 
    voters in the rationalism vs. dogmatism election, metaphorically speaking. 
    It does not make much sense to say &quot;thou shalt be rational&quot;. The best that 
    those who value and cherish rationalism can do is to target this majority, 
    present to them examples of rational arguments to refute or critique issues, 
    debunk the claims of mystics, godmen and other charlartans by logical means 
    and evidence. This can be through electronic and print media, or preferably 
    if possible through practical workshops as has been done in many rural 
    outbacks of India. I also strongly suggest that rationalism be included in 
    high school curricula. While it may be unrealistic to expect this to happen 
    in the current environment in many countries where religious sentiments run 
    high, specially if rationalism is pitted against the popular religion, it 
    may be acceptable including rationalism as a general philosophy to emphasize 
    reason and evidence over blind faith and superstition. Leading educators and 
    academicians need to take the lead in lobbying with the relevant authorites 
    for such curricular changes. </p>
    <p>Next, to many, rationalism means robbing one of the sense of beauty, 
    romanticism, love, compassion , i.e leaves one heartless and devoid of 
    emotions. This is a big myth. <b>
    <font color="#ff0000" style="line-height: 1.35em">Rationalism stresses 
    separating the head from the heart, not REPLACING heart with head. </font>
    Certain things are intrinsically rooted in instinct, and thus beyond 
    rationalism. Love, fear, altruism, conscience (sense of right and wrong), 
    these are biologically rooted instincts.</b> Instincts are not controllable 
    or influenced by rationalism. Instincts are more or less hardwired in our 
    genes and manifested through the workings of the limbic system of our brain. 
    Whereas rationalism results from the thought process determined by the 
    evolution of cerebral cortex. Humans posses both these brain components. So 
    a rational person can feel an instinctive fear in certain environment, or 
    can feel passionate love for certain person. What differentiates a rational 
    person from a less or rational or emotional person is the synaptic 
    connectivities in their cerebral cortex, not in their limbic system. So when 
    it comes to primal instincts controlled by limbic systems, for example 
    self-preservation, the difference disappears. In a life threatening 
    situation, control is automatically taken over by the limbic system from the 
    cerebral cortex, biological instinct of aggression may kick in, and at that 
    point whatever one does is not subject to rationalism anymore. Taste is also 
    instinctive. Rationalism has nothing to do with it. <b>Although rationalism 
    does not decide or control our tastes and emotions, it can however EXPLAIN 
    (or at least try to through scientific method) the basis of such emotions 
    and likes or dislikes. Rationalism cannot affect or control love. But 
    rationalism can certainly help <i>explain</i> the biological (in both 
    evolutionary and biochemical terms) origin of love, morality and other human 
    values and attributes.</b> The same can be said about all other instincts 
    and emotions. A good example of that would be the book &quot;Why we feel : The 
    Science of Emotions&quot; by Victor Johnston. So being rational does not by any 
    means deprive of those instincts, tastes and emotions, because they are an 
    integral part of being human, rational or not. Rationalism enables humans to 
    understand and explain the underlyinmg basis of emotions, it does not rob us 
    of the emotions. A neurologist does not lose his mind(brain) in trying to 
    understand the workings of the brain, nor does an evolutionary biologist 
    ceases to be a loving mate or parent in trying to explain and understand the 
    biological roots of love, simply because we have no control on our 
    biological instincts, whether we are rational or not. Rationalism however 
    can however help to control the impulses that emotions may lead to. In 
    biological language, although the generation of emotions in the limbic 
    system itself cannot be controlled, the impulsive ACTS (e.g aggression) that 
    those emotions often lead to can be controlled by the feedback mechanism of 
    the cerebral cortex over the limbic system. <br>
    </span>Another &quot;reason&quot; for viewing rationalism with cynical eyes by many is 
    because it is believed by them that humanitarian acts should come from an 
    emotional impulse, not from a rationalization process, which does not take 
    the compassion factor in the decision of such acts. On first look, it may 
    look like a noble view, putting heart before head. But as I pointed out, 
    compassion, humanitarian acts all are derived from altruism, a biologically 
    rooted instinct, so rationalism cannot affect it. Although rationalism can 
    certainly manage altruistic instinct in a way that ensures optimum 
    utilization of it. Impulsive altruistic acts do not always lead to the best 
    results. Rationalism can help to channelize our altruistic instincts in the 
    most optimal manner. At a very personal level, of course even a rationalist 
    can (and often does) act out of an impulse and do an act of humanitarianism 
    or compassion, since doing so is not contradicted by logic. Compassion 
    should not REPLACE rationalism, but must be accompanied by it. A good 
    example would be the case of a judge granting leniency to convicted on 
    compassionate grounds. But the compassion follows only after a thorough 
    rational analysis of the crimes committed by the convicted. Rationalism is 
    truly applicable in forming opinions, judgments, learning the truth and 
    solving problems, but not to instincts, or impulses that are non-judgmental, 
    non-intrusive and innocuous</p>
    <p>Lastly I will be remiss if I do not point out the challenge that 
    rationalism is facing from the postmodernist thinking that seems to be 
    gaining ground in recent years. Postmodernists are challenging that very 
    golden product of rationalism, namely scientific method by insisting that 
    scientific method is just one among many EQUALLY valid route to truth and 
    deserves no special privileged status. This is nothing but intellectual 
    anarchism. Postmodernists are nothing but armchair social scientists that 
    have fallen much behind modern scientific paradigms and are threatened by 
    the scientific approach that the social sciences are adopting (rather being 
    forced to adopt). They are watching with frustration one after another 
    social discipline is losing ground to the exact sciences. Not being able to 
    face upto the challenge of the sciences some of them have chosen the 
    treacherous art of deconstruction and misapplying it to scientific method. 
    So rationalism now faces challenges from two fronts, <b>religious dogma</b> 
    (which Europeans successfully faced during the renaissance), and <b>
    postmodernism</b>, which is a new challenge that needs to be faced. So the 
    need to emphasize rationalism is more now than ever. Hopefully my fellow 
    Mukto-Monas will share my passion for rationalism.</p>
