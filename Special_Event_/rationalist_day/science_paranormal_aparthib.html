  <p align="justify">I have discussed the meaning and implications of
  rationalism in a companion essay <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/rationalist_day/rationalism_aparthib.html">Rationalism
  - Its meaning and Implications</a> . Here I wish to dwell on some further
  implications in view of the essay <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/rationalist_day/rationalism_sina.html">&quot;What
  it Takes to be a Rationalist&quot;</a> by Ali Sina, an outspoken proponent of
  freethinking and rationalism. I agree to most of what Ai Sina has said. But
  some of his views and conclusions deserve some serious critique as they are
  based on incorrect assumptions and characterizations. It is not my intent to
  engage in an one to one debate with Ali Sina, who has anyway expressed his
  intention of not responding to any criticism of his essay. I hope that even if
  he doesn't respond to his critics, he at least does not take a closed minded
  view and refuse to read what his critics has to say, by assuming that his
  views are infallible. Anyway, what I intend to do here is to examine carefully
  some of his comments and views that are shared by many liberal thinkers with
  little or no background in the hard sciences. My response is targeted to the
  readers of Ali Sina's essay and attempts to clarify some misgivings that may
  have been generated in their minds about science rationalism and paranormal by
  his essay. For a detailed discussion of issues relating to science vs.
  paranormal and science vs. dogma please also refer the two articles I posted in

  </ul>
  Science is an anathema to Dogma. Scientific method is based on skepticism and
  rationalism. So science cannot be called a dogma or a religion by definition,
  neither can anyone make science their dogma or religion.
  <p align="justify">To say that most scientists are dogmatic, as concluded by
  Ali Sina, is the same as saying that science is a dogma, because it cannot be
  a coincidence for most scientists to be dogmatist, if science was not a
  dogma. Scientists are huge community, and like any large sample it follows the
  statistical distribution of various mindsets. There will be some scientists
  who may hold a dogma like view on certain issues. But it is baseless to say or
  imply that most scientists HAVE BEEN, ARE, AND WILL BE dogmatists (Ali Sina's
  statement implies that). Asserting such a sweeping statement is itself a dogma
  like position. Scientific method is an inevitable outcome of rationalism.
  Science is the rational method of explaining and studying natural phenomena (i.e
  any observations susceptible to the senses directly, or indirectly through
  sense enhancers, i.e scientific instruments). Since science itself has no
  element of dogma in it, it is safe to say that most scientists cannot be
  dogmatists on a consistent basis. It is unfortunate that Ali Sina labeled the
  majority of scientists as &quot;pseudo-rationalists&quot; for their skepticism
  about the claims of paranormal. The truth is that A FEW scientists may have a
  dogmatic view on certain issues, which is a far cry from science being a dogma
  or scientists being dogmatic. If the view of a scientist &quot;Dr. Smith&quot;
  on an issue appears to be dogma like then it is not proper to say that
  scientists are dogmatic or that SCIENTIST Dr. Smith is a dogmatist. The only
  thing one can say is that the PERSON Dr. Smith is a dogmatist. Science has
  nothing to do with the personal views of anyone, scientist or not. It is a
  fallacy similar to that committed by religious apologists when they assert
  that atheists also commit atrocities by citing Hitler or Stalin as atheists.
  Where in fact the atrocities of both had little to do with atheism, but much
  to do their dogma about communism or racial supremacy. It is not only
  preposterous to make this leap from the dogmatic views of a few scientists or
  science advocates to the sweeping generalization of science or scientists, but
  also misleads many liberals with no background in the hard sciences and propagates
  that myth among them, because such characterization has a prima
  facie appeal to nonscientific laymen, liberal or dogmatic.
  <p align="justify">If science cannot be a dogma, then upholding science cannot
  be a dogma. Is it possible to uphold it to a fault? NO. Just like you cannot
  be too honest or you cannot be too rationalistic, you cannot be too
  scientific. Either you believe (not from blind faith but by logic and
  evidence) in science or you do not. There is an eerie resemblance between the
  expression &quot;secular fundamentalism&quot; and &quot;dogmatic
  science&quot;. Neither expressions are technically correct or meaningful
  semantic constructs. They are used to convey a certain emotional view. When
  strict enforcement of secularism clashes with political correctness then it is
  (mis)labeled as secular fundamentalism. When rigid scientific attitude contradicts or seem to
  contradict (Since it is almost always due to
  misinterpreting the the rigid scientific views) of one's metaphysical beliefs
  and aspirations, then such rigid scientific attitude is (mis) labeled as
  &quot;scientism&quot; or scientific dogmatism. When Science appears to be too
  successful and too hard to master, then many academicians in the humanities
  and social sciences out of what Peter Medawar calls science envy, to portray
  science as just another dogma, not any better in seeking the truth than any
  other method. Although as I argued that one cannot logically be dogmatic
  scientist (or scientific dogmatist), what one can do is MISINTERPRET
  science/rationality. And it is the misinterpretation that has been unfortunately
  labeled as scientific dogmatism. For example if some one
  affirms that science WILL explain everything, that is not a statement from
  science. It is a personal conviction. It may be true, or may not be. We have
  no way to ever know if that is true or false. It may be dogma like statement
  but is strictly not a dogma to state that since science has been able to
  explain many phenomena that were previously unexplainable, science possibly
  can explain all phenomena. But it will be a misinterpretation to state that
  &quot;Science will explain everything&quot; itself is a scientific statement.
  It is quite common to see many critics make a straw man out scientists
  alleging they (scientists) say or claim this or that and then refute those
  views by scientists, although scientists actually do not make such statements
  or phrase it the way it is cited and refuted by their critics. Much of Ali
  Sina's essay one can agree with, but which is also based on such straw man
  fallacy about scientists, and hence even if correct, is misdirected.
  <p align="justify">Now let me go into some subtleties. One of Dr. Sina's main
  contention was that many scientists (or pseudo rationalists in his words) dismiss
  or deny the paranormal. We must be very careful with semantics here.
  First of all, occurrence of paranormal and its explanation are two distinct affair. Explanation comes after acknowledgement of its occurrence. The example
  of Aurora Borealis in the past, which Dr. Sina cited was an event whose
  occurrence were not disputed, but its explanation were. Science provided only
  the explanation. But the occurrence of Aurora Borealis were not just claims of
  persons. They were OBSERVABLE by objective criteria. But the paranormal claims
  are not comparable. The occurrence of paranormal events are still confined to
  individual or collective anecdote. They have not been objectively observed
  like the Aurora Borealis. But even then science (or scientists, not persons)
  do not affirm that the claimed paranormal events CANNOT happen. It only says
  that the claim does not meet the criteria to establish its existence beyond
  reasonable doubt. To put in simple words, the position of science regarding
  alleged paranormal events is that &quot;It MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED, but it cannot
  be said that IT HAS HAPPENED just because some person or persons have claimed
  to have seen/witnessed it&quot;. The number of witness is irrelevant to
  science. Science or scientists refuse to accept something as truth (like
  alleged occurrence of paranormal) just by personal testimony of individuals or
  group of individuals. That is the hallmark of skepticism, a necessary
  ingredient of scientific method. Dr. Sina misinterpreted this refusal to accept
  the CLAIMS OF OCCURRENCE of paranormal as DENIAL OF THE OCCURRENCE of
  paranormal itself. When the occurrence of a so called paranormal phenomena
  satisfies the criteria of acceptability, there can be no question on the occurrence, but of explanation. For example, the case of Hindu Lord Ganesh
  oozing milk was a real occurrence. Here the occurrence was scientifically
  measurable. It was not just personal testimony. But the occurrence was
  explained by science. Even if there was no immediate scientific explanation available there is no justification for rushing into a non-scientific
  explanation invoking vague and undefined objects or entities. It is not the
  scientists/rationalists/science that explain them away with absurd and
  implausible theories, as Ali Sina has opined, in connection with crop circles,
  but rather the dogmatic proponents of the paranormals who do. Science never
  offers absurd or implausible explanations, rather offers plausible ones,
  guided by Occam's razor. There are those who simply narrate their personal
  experience of alleged paranormal events. reporting is not absurd. Anyone may
  truly feel the experience of paranormal. At least we know that human brains
  have amazing abilities to cause unusual experiences to be felt in unique
  situations. Not that all such events are necessarily generated by the brain.
  But to insist that just because someone has truly felt a paranormal event,
  hence such event must have actually taken place independent one's brain induced
  experience or perception, or to affirm that its occurrence is beyond
  the explaining power of science (assuming it did occur), then that IS a
  dogmatic assertion. Ali Sina adopted quite the opposite view when he ridiculed
  a scientist who had personally experienced a so called paranormal phenomena but was skeptical of its explanation. He did not DENY the experience, he
  refused to assign an emotional interpretation that dogmatists of the
  paranormal would wish to attribute to such experiences. The Iranian scientist
  was a true skeptic, instead Ali Sina called him a dogmatist, because he
  refused to make a certain personal interpretation of his experience that many
  paranormal dogmatists would like to adopt. There is nothing irrational about
  not making a biased interpretation of one's experience. Again, I must
  emphasize that to deny certain interpretation of an experience does not mean
  DENYING the occurrence, as the oozing of milk by Ganesh illustrates.
  <p align="justify">A vast assortment of alleged paranormal phenomena is pure
  personal testimony, not observed scientifically. That does not mean they did
  not occur. But it also cannot be said that they DID occur or that they cannot
  be explained by science if they did occur.
  <p align="justify">Science can only point the difference between MIGHT HAVE
  HAPPEND/HAS HAPPENED. Nothing more. It cannot say it CAN NEVER HAPPEN either
  as that would be a dogma like assertion. Of course we are so far limited to
  events that are unexplainable by science but not violating laws of science
  (Paranormal). But if the event being claimed to have occurred also violates
  established scientific law (Supernatural) then there is reason to be even more
  skeptical about its occurrence. Then the position of science would be: It most
  PROBABLY didn't happen. Anyway for the paranormal, the criterion to promote
  the &quot;MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED&quot; to &quot;HAS HAPPENED&quot; is set by
  rationalism as embedded in the scientific method. There is nothing dogmatic
  about it. Secondly, once a paranormal event is universally agreed to have
  occurred (Parenthetically, such scientifically acknowledged occurrence of
  paranormal events does not exist yet), only then the question of explaining it
  arises. It is not unreasonable to start with the hypothesis that the
  occurrence may be explained by science. There is nothing dogmatic about it,
  because it is a hypothesis. Moreover thus hypothesis does not make any other
  assumption about science. It represents a future hope and is thus not
  falsified even if scientific explanation is not found in finite time. The
  track record of science does give that hypothesis some legitimacy and
  credibility. The affirmation of an alternative possibility that Science can
  never explain it is truly a dogma, because it is a categorical statement, and
  is also based on additional assumption about science itself, that science can
  never develop enough in future to be able to explain it, making an indirect assumption that
  there is a &quot;divine&quot; reason for its occurrence.
  <p align="justify">Dr. Sina made the monumental blunder by concluding that
  &quot;scientists can be as much dogmatic as religionists&quot; (exact quote),
  by citing the example of Nazis adopting Lamarckism as their dogma. The blunder
  was on two counts. First, Nazis were not scientists as a community. There may
  have been some scientist members. So their view cannot be labeled as
  scientists' view. Secondly, Lamarckism was discredited by science itself
  (before Hitler's day). So adopting Lamackism as a dogma cannot be labeled as
  adopting science as dogma. Lamarckism is not science. Science is a method, not
  just one single theory or law. If someone today insists in the belief that
  ether exists, then that does not make the scientists instantly dogmatists. We
  cannot label the scientists as dogmatists every time someone (scientist or
  nonscientist) insists on believing in a discredited theory.
  <p align="justify">Science is a term to mean a rational method of
  understanding and explaining phenomena, in contrast with dogmatic method.
  &quot;Rational&quot; critics like Ali Sina view science as something similar
  to religion and thus like religion, there can be dogmatic adherents of science
  as well, according to him. It is a clear fallacy. Anyone can choose to be
  dogmatic about an issue, he can be a religionist, a scientist or a even true
  rationalist like Ali Sina. But Science or scientists as a community will never
  be another dogma or religion or followers of such. Only religion will be
  religion and dogma will be dogma. Science is not a religion or a dogma, so it
  can never be or turned into one. No one can adopt or make science a religion.
  You cannot use a pen to hammer a nail. Neither can you use a hammer to write.
  They are not made for such uses. Science is not made for use as a dogma.
  Science is the anathema of all &quot;isms&quot;. The plain fact that he missed
  or chose to miss is that science is an offshoot of true rationalism. Science
  IS true skepticism. The coining of a new word science to signify
  &quot;rational inquiry of phenomena&quot; does not mean it is a new ism or
  tenet, besides religion, and rationalism and skepticism. It is different from
  religion alright, but not from rationalism, freethinking and skepticism. So
  one cannot use science as dogma or religion, because that would mean making
  rationalism and skepticism as one's religion or dogma, a patently absurd
  position.
  <p align="justify">Ali Sina ended with the anticipation/expectation that his
  views would be dismissed by those he called pseudoscientists. Well, the truth
  is that it is the pseudoscientists who view science and religion as dogma. His
  views would resonate well with a substantial number of liberals and postmodernist, most of who are not
  sufficiently science literate anyway. So he
  doesn't have to feel lonely for his views. He is with a large company. It is
  the scientists and strict rationalists who are in the minority and have to
  face the challenges and critiques from both religious apologists and postmodernist
  liberals.
  <p>Finally, just to remind the readers and Ali Sina if he ever reads this,
  that this essay does not criticize HIM, but some of his views on science vs. rationalism. His points are well taken that it is not rational to emphatically
  deny the OCCURRENCE of a paranormal event that has been claimed to occur. I
  can assure him that the view of scientist cannot be such categorical denial.
  What scientists mean (may be they do not convey that in clear terms) that the
  claims of the paranormal occurrence itself is no proof of its occurrence or
  grounds for accepting their occurrences. Anyone saying that paranormal events
  cannot ever occur is of course not representing the scientific view or the
  scientists. I hope I have clarified the view of science and scientists
  correctly.</p>
