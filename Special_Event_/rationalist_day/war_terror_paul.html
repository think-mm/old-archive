    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The War on Terror has produced
    extremely intense debate in the west.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    right wing (strictly speaking, pro-war) is perplexed that seemingly
    intelligent, friendly and moral people, have essentially acted to protect
    one of the most obscene dictators of modern times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The left wing (strictly speaking, anti-war) is perplexed that
    seemingly intelligent and reasonably friendly people could exhibit all the
    characteristics of racist warmongers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    Muslim countries meanwhile have all the evidence needed to conclusively
    prove that non-Muslims with superior weaponry and sectarian bigotry are
    perpetrating atrocities and attempting to change the culture and/or religion
    of Muslims.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">This document is an attempt to look
    at the problem from each perspective, to identify the major
    misunderstandings, which have come from all sides.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>It then attempts to set a realistic goal (secure liberal
    democracies), and then suggests a course of action to achieve that goal.</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><b>Right Wing Position</b><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">It has been noted before and after
    9/11 that Muslims, especially Middle-Eastern Muslims, appear to wish harm on
    various groups, including </span><st1:country-region>
    <st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">America</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU"> and other first-world non-Muslim nations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>It is the attack on American soil, combined with the extreme success
    of the attack, that has finally proved that doing something, anything, is
    probably less harmful than the previous policy of essentially ignoring, or
    engaging in ineffective diplomacy, hoping that the problem would eventual
    die a natural death.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The lack of a state actor meant that
    a simplistic response was not an option.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The “nuclear deterrent” turned out to be insufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>A nuclear response against </span><st1:country-region>
    <st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">Afghanistan</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU"> is completely pointless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>None of the civilians had the ability to be deterred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>They were essentially slaves, or prisoners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>They may even be allies had they been freed from bondage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>A dictator who does not care what happens to his “slaves” may not
    be deterrable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If his minions’
    lives have no value, and he is willing to trade his own life for a place in
    the history books, as well as a place in heaven, it may be considered a
    worthwhile exchange.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should
    be noted that many Muslims are making this exact trade-off for much less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Bin Laden, instead of living a life of splendour, is hiding in a
    cave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Never assume that humans
    won’t do something because it is irrational.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Err on the side of caution and assume that they are unpredictable,
    and look instead at capability.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">A reasonable approach would be to at
    least make the government accountable to the people they govern, especially
    if the governor is dangerous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
    will hopefully restore the accountability of the government, and restore the
    nuclear deterrent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not
    make sense to hold slaves accountable for the actions of their master.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Nor is it immoral to topple a slave-master, as the west has as much
    right to force the will of the slaves onto the master, as the master ever
    did to force his will onto his slaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor
    is it immoral to wage conventional war on the government, as it is surely
    less heavy-handed than waging nuclear war on the people.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">World War II gave the knowledge that
    it is usually better to strike enemies before they acquire superior
    weaponry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus no hostile
    dictator should rest easy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
    they can be defeated, they should be defeated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>We do not have perfect intelligence, and we will never have perfect
    intelligence - in fact, you could argue our intelligence gets it wrong more
    often than they get it right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    do not know what nefarious activities hostile, secretive governments may be
    up to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But state-organized
    demonstrations with placards reading “Death to </span><st1:country-region>
    <st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">USA</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU">” do not bode well for peaceful coexistance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>When the people in these regimes have control of petrodollars, the
    impetus to deal with the most visible problem increases even more.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Underlying reasons for terrorist
    attacks or anti-Americanism in general, whether it be failure to destroy
    Israel, sectarian bigotry suggesting “infidel” troops shouldn’t be
    allowed in a Muslim country, jealousy, racism, poverty, whatever, are of
    some interest, as it may provide insight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>This insight may be useful to destroy the enemy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>There is no suggestion of altering behaviour to be acceptable to the
    terrorists, as that will just encourage more people to do the same, for
    whatever political (or non-political) grievances they may have.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Plus, we behave the way we do (generally defending democracies)
    because we want to, not because we considered whether that was reasonable
    from a terrorist’s point of view.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The suggestion that this is due to
    poverty is seen as a cynical attempt to extort yet more money from the west,
    given that the poorest people, those in sub-Saharan Africa, are not reknown
    for terrorism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition,
    no-one in </span><st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">Africa</span></st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU"> or the </span><st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">Middle East</span></st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU"> is poor because the </span><st1:country-region>
    <st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">USA</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU"> or anyone else stole all their wealth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>By and large, they were a lot poorer before, but like the rest of the
    world, their living standard has also increased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>It may not have increased as much as the </span><st1:country-region>
    <st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">USA</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU">’s has, but this is a separate, economic question
    (which the right wing will be happy to answer if those who wish to improve
    their lot in life would like to learn about capitalism).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The fact is that terrorism has increased, at the same time that
    standard of living has increased (at least over the long term).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Increased standard of living is not likely to be a cause of
    terrorism, and poverty certainly isn’t.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The above recipe, toppling
    dictators, replacing them with accountible democracies, is not particularly
    expected to create a panacea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    fact, even with healthy capitalist systems giving the average citizen
    something to live for, rather than promised riches to die for, is not
    necessarily going to create a panacea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
    the fact that historically, democracies tend not to declare war on other
    democracies, isn’t necessarily expected to remain true forever more.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>However, it is expected that toppling hostile dictators would be a
    good step on the road to where we wish to go.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>One thing that military might is certainly able to achieve is to
    remove such odious things as institutionalized rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>It remains to be seen if much more can also be achieved, for both the
    people of the liberated country, and for the west itself.</span></p>

    Using force of arms is inherently wrong, as the winner is whoever has the
    best arms. That happens to be us at the moment, but how would we like it if
    it was the other way around? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Might
    doesn't make right, and the fundamental basis of our society is &quot;Do
    unto others as you would have others do unto you&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Throw out this concept and there is no difference between you and
    those you oppose, by definition.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The Koran is the word of God, the
    Koran says so, and so did my parents, and my teachers, and my friends, and
    most of the country. It is ridiculous to suggest that all these people could
    be wrong, even people with PhDs. I am not so vain that I consider myself to
    be smarter than all these people. The Koran says I should love my Muslim
    brothers, and I can certainly feel their kinship with me. We all agree that
    westerners shouldn't be coming here and imposing their will on us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Sure, we have a few internal problems, but we are all Muslims, and
    no-one gave authority to westerners to impose their culture on us. Their
    superior weaponry is an unfortunate ground reality. Eventually they too will
    realise the truth in Islam, just like the Mongols did, and ultimately we
    will be victorious. In the meantime, we will use what weapons we do have, to
    try to get them out of our face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/">www.faithfreedom.org</a>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><b>Misunderstandings</b></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
    All positions make sense from the point of view of those who hold them,
    which is why very few are willing to change.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>With the inherent assumptions, they are all correct!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Let us now look closer at the inherent assumptions and erroneous
    logic.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The assumption that the Koran is the
    the word of God because it says so in the Koran is a circular argument, and
    anything contained within therefore contains no more weight than a book by
    any other author. This is not something specific to the Muslim religion. Any
    other religion causing mayhem based on similar reasoning would be similarly
    dismissed.<br>
    <br>
    It is not inherently wrong to use force of arms. The police use force of
    arms to protect the public. The criminals do not get the right to demand a
    level playing field. In fact, our society goes to a lot of effort to make
    sure every battle is an unequal one, in the police's favour.<br>

    At this point, some will counter that the UN is the police, not the </span><st1:country-region>
    <st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">US</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU">, and that if the UN were to authorize it, they wouldn't
    have a problem.<br>
    <br>
    The trouble with this assumption is that the UN is not a police force. It
    may or may not be nice if that was the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>However, you should notice in your own society that there is an
    &quot;entrance criteria&quot; to join the police force. E.g. it is very
    unlikely that known criminals would be allowed membership of the police
    force. This is not the case in the UN. Membership in the UN is based on
    whether you control the strongest armed group in your country.<br>

    innovation is not guaranteed to be in the hands of the most economically
    powerful country (although absent revolutionary invention, or gross
    mismanagement, that is certainly most likely).<br>

    <br>
    Also, do not assume that guns in the hands of civilians is sufficient
    protection against an odious government. Guns were common in Saddam's
    regime. Successful revolutions were much rarer. Do not over rely on
    mythology and the movie &quot;Red Dawn&quot; for your personal safety. Also
    do not rely on the bravery of a volunteer army over conscripts, or
    democracies over dictatorships. In fact, even with superior weaponry, don't
    assume victory even then. In World War II, the German tank force beat a
    superior British/French force with superior tactics.<br>
    <br>
    And even do not place all your faith in allies. A military coup can change
    the best friend into the worst enemy, in the blink of an eye.<br>
    <br>
    The only safe assumption is that the world is inherently unsafe. The only
    reason we aren't living under one of a variety of potential dictatorships
    currently, has a lot more to do with luck than we would like to believe. It
    could have been you in the gulags, and there is no mathematical equation
    that proves that we won't have gulags and slavery in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The price of democracy is eternal vigilence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Unfortunately we don’t know how much vigilence is enough, nor
    whether we will be disciplined enough in the future to remember the lessons
    of the past.</span></p>

    Praying to a god will not solve the problem, as 6 million Jews can attest
    to. Nor will signing peace treaties solve the problem, as Chamberlain can
    attest to. The ability to organize violence in your favour will determine
    how many rights you get, wishful thinking aside.<br>
    <br>
    One thing that the left wing and right wing in the west can agree on is they
    would not want to lose the freedoms that they currently enjoy. What is less
    agreed is whether these freedoms should be enjoyed by other countries who
    are currently living under dictatorship, and regardless of the answer to
    that question, whether they have the right, or the obligation, to change
    that situation.<br>
    <br>
    Leaving morality aside, as it plays little part in deciding the outcome, we
    can at least agree that the objective is to ensure our own freedoms remain
    intact, regardless of what atrocities occur elsewhere. We can at least agree
    that anyone who attempts to impose some sort of Islamic dictatorship on us
    is wrong to do so, and should be defended against. Even if the Islamic
    dictatorship in </span><st1:country-region>

    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Internal Threats</b></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
    Let us now look at the dangers to our personal security. The danger from
    within is that either a revolution or a military coup will introduce a
    brutal regime. The chances of a revolution in a modern democracy are quite
    slim, as the revolutionaries would normally just vote themselves into power
    if they had the numbers.<br>
    <br>
    A military coup is not so rare. Very few countries have a long record of
    uninterrupted democratic rule. At the time of writing (2004), </span><st1:country-region>
    <st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">Venezuela</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU"> is at a democratic crossroad.<br>
    <br>
    The likelihood of a military coup can be mitigated by getting soldiers to
    swear allegiance to the constitution, and require them to refuse to obey an
    illegal order. This ingrained allegiance, combined with a general population
    that is tolerant enough to accept electoral defeat, and with an economy in
    working order, makes the concept of a military coup absurd in some
    countries, such as </span><st1:country-region>
    <st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">Australia</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU">. You would be hard pressed to find a single soldier to
    go along with an attempt to install a dictator.<br>
    <br>
    However, this situation is not guaranteed, and it is especially not
    guaranteed in other countries that are not in the same position. No two
    countries are identical, so it is not possible to just compare some aspects
    and assume that it won't happen in your country. If you have been subjected
    to a military coup, the only rights you get are what your new ruler is
    willing to give you.<br>
    <br>
    Depending on the nature of the coup, your only salvation may come from an
    external power. With the current membership of the UN, there is a very good
    chance that that will be considered an &quot;internal matter&quot;, and no
    help will be forthcoming. There is currently not even a facility where a
    country can ask to be put on a list with a title of &quot;These countries
    wish to be invaded in the event of a coup, where the military is unwilling
    to hold a free and fair referendum to restore the democratically elected
    government&quot;. I think that such a list would help deter many would-be
    coup plotters, and make the others play ball regardless.<br>
    <br>
    Your other opportunity for salvation comes if an external power decides
    unilaterally that your country in the hands of the new leader poses a threat
    to them, whether that be a security threat or an economic threat. This is
    most likely to be done on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, although
    (their) morality <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>may factor into
    their decision.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>External Threats</b><br>
    <br>
    At any time, any foreign power, regardless of whether it has done a
    cost-benefit analysis, may choose <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>to
    invade you.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision may
    come down to the irrational whim of a dictator. Not only that, but given the
    inherently uncertain nature of war, he may even be successful against the
    odds, especially in the absence of warning signs. An unconventional attack
    against air bases could do untold damage. Not many armies can survive
    against an opposition that dominates the skies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span></span><st1:country-region>

    <span lang="EN-AU">Israel</span></st1:place>
    </st1:country-region>
    <span lang="EN-AU">’s “Six Day War” remains the “gold standard”
    for audacity in the face of annihilation.<br>
    <br>
    There are two main factors at play:<br>
    <br>
    1. Incentive to attack.<br>
    2. Capability to attack.<br>
    <br>
    If your neighbour is a democracy, you are less likely to be subjected to
    attack based on whim. In addition, if it is an open government, the attack
    is less likely to be a surprise, as the benefits of mounting an attack would
    have been debated in parliament before-hand.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, in an open government, the capability of your neighbour is more
    likely to be known in advance too.<br>
    <br>
    It is my judgement that my country is safer when it's neighbours are
    democratically accountable, and military purchases are able to be
    scrutinized.<br>
    <br>
    In addition, the desire for a democracy to invade another democracy in a
    land grab, while theoretically possible, has no historical precedent.
    Democracies never, or almost never, wage war on other democracies. If this
    equation remains true into the future, merely invading a neighbouring
    dictatorship, even a peaceful one, potentially has benefits for your own
    security. Even more secure than installing a puppet government to do your
    bidding!<br>
    <br>
    This is at least in as far as it democratically choosing to attack you,
    anyway. If you install a puppet government, there's more chance of you being
    able to use resources from that country to go and invade further afield.
    However, you also run the risk of internal rebellion.<br>
    <br>
    Without considering morality, from a pure cost-benefit perspective, one
    attractive option is to invade any unfriendly dictators, install a
    democracy, and then you will most likely gain either an ally or a neutral.
    Neither would be expected to tie up resources.<br>
    <br>
    And if your own country should ultimately have a military coup, then there
    is actually the potential of your new democratic neighbours to do the same
    cold hard calculation, and then choosing to invade your country.<br>
    <br>
    Although we don't have hard data for this, it is my belief that if Australia
    had a coup, and New Zealand were to come and invade/liberate Australia, most
    Australian personnel would &quot;defect&quot; to the New Zealand side at the
    first opportunity. A small minority of Australians would wish to live under
    a military coup, no matter what &quot;great&quot; policies that military
    leader had. There is no history to suggest that the invaders would wish to
    truly occupy rather than liberate, although that is certainly technically
    possible.<br>
    <br>
    Even greater security is made available if there are multiple democratic
    states &quot;coming to the rescue&quot;, for either or both of selfish and
    altruistic reasons. The chances of them all agreeing to carry out nefarious
    activities once arriving are realistically very remote.<br>
    <br>
    There's safety in democracy, and there's safety in numbers of democracies.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Questions of Morality</b><br>
    <br>
    The west has had a checkered history of imposing religion on conquered
    peoples. At the time it seemed moral. As a result of this legacy, the west
    has become so self-critical, at least in the left wing, that they have
    essentially questioned their own judgement of what is right and wrong.
    Almost to the point where a rapist might be considered an
    &quot;overenthusiastic lover&quot;.</span></p>

    &nbsp;</o:p>
    </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">This self-criticism only appears to
    be liberally applied to society as a whole, especially if a right wing

    there is criticism of the left from the left... http://www.marxist.org.uk/htm_docs/comm12.htm</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
    <br>
    The right wing has not reached the point where they are unwilling to make a
    clear moral judgement between right and wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>This was done in the fight against Communism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The right wing was eager to fight both Nazism and Communism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The left wing was largely only willing to fight Nazism. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In
    fact, the fact that the right wing was willing to fight Nazism is more a
    sign of being “centrist” than right wing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The “right wing” terminology was basically introduced by the
    communists, who considered that all capitalists were right wing Nazis, and
    therefore needed to be defeated at all costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The terminology stuck, along with other language changes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>All designed to defeat the counter-revolutionaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In this situation, right wing gut-feeling boils down to this:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
    We, with knowingly good intentions, have more of a right to impose the
    people of the invaded country's will onto the leader of that country, than
    that government has the right to violate (rape, murder) the citizens of that
    country. And furthermore, imposing the people's will on the govenment,
    should not be confused with past examples (invading South America) where our
    ancestors were imposing their will onto the people of the invaded country's
    people (to force them to adopt Christianity).<br>
    <br>
    Note that another complication is that evangelic Christians are
    predominantly in the right wing, so others have mistakenly assumed that the
    right wing is doing this because they are Christian bigots invading Muslim
    countries, like the good old days in </span><st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">South America</span></st1:place>
    <span lang="EN-AU">. As an atheist, I can assure you that the morals about
    not raping and killing have nothing to do with Christianity, and more to do
    with<br>
    Confucius et al's &quot;do unto others as you would have others do unto
    you&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    Ironically, it is this &quot;golden rule&quot; that the left wing have
    missed in action. I would hope that in the event of my daughter being
    systematically raped by my government's representatives, that other
    countries out there, democratic or otherwise, would come to my rescue rather
    than saying &quot;my ancestors signed the Treaty of Westphalia in the year
    1648 that says we're not allowed to interfere in the affairs of another
    state and it’s as relevant today as it was back then&quot;. I would prefer
    that they instead looked even further back in history when Persiagave us a
    declaration of human rights in 539 BC, which made no mention of rights
    ending at conceptual lines in the sand.<br>
    <br>
    The Evangelic Christians are unfortunately unable to put into words why they
    think it is OK to invade and end systematic rape. They are more likely to
    quote from their bible that it is wrong, because by “coincidence&quot;,
    what they know of the bible essentially mimics the &quot;golden rule&quot;.
    But their failure to distance themselves from &quot;religious bigotry&quot;
    has led to a misunderstanding with both the western left wing, and the
    Muslims, which only further stokes the anger by these groups.</span></p>

    <b>Conclusion</b><br>
    <br>
    A series of misunderstandings (from all sides, about all sides) between the
    3 main camps has led to some very unfortunate outcomes. We have liberals
    effectively standing up for one of the world's most brutal dictators, when
    in reality that is WAY against their ethos. And the right wing is
    incessantly claiming that &quot;Islam is a religion of peace&quot;, when
    reality is that Mohammed's brutal regime, comparable only to the likes of
    Stalin, Hitler and Saddam, has yet to actually be defeated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>You can’t get an enemy to retract his declaration of war against
    you just because you don’t like the terms of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we are engaged in a religious war.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Dr Mahathir spelled out the enemy’s plans in sufficient detail that
    no-one can claim ignorance of any impending disaster that could have been
    avoided had appropriate measures been implemented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
    </span>It is not his job to make sure we take due notice of his plans, that
    is our own responsibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
    should thank him for his contribution and come up with our own plans for
    safeguarding our future.<br>
    <br>
    Islam is not a religion of peace - the Koran is a book of war, even going
    into details about what you can do with captured slaves. This is all
