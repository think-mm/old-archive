  <p>Of so many gifts of the Muslim civilization the Bengali Calendar is the one 
  that has survived the test of time. Time is inexorable, immeasurable and 
  indivisible. Yet to identify the progress not only of the individual's works 
  and achievements but of the humanity as a whole, units like second, minute, 
  hours, day, week, month and year have been conceived of for convenience and 
  practical purposes. The progress of civilization has witnessed the innovation 
  and introduction of calendars of different denominations suiting the 
  particular purposes of the innovators and most of them have not withstood the 
  onslaught of the destructive forces of time.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>The Bengali Calendar, we know, was introduced by Akbar the great Mughal 
  emperor of Delhi in order particularly to suit the purpose of collecting rent 
  (land tax) in an effective manner. Akbar's sagacity and foresight prompted him 
  to this innovation, for he was strongly motivated to put the Bengal Suba-a 
  part of the subcontinent that was always bent on breaking the shackles of 
  domination and restoring independence at every opportunity-under permanent 
  Mughal rule by creating congenial condition for, among others, clearance of 
  rent immediately after the harvesting season so that people could not feel the 
  burden unbearable and the resultant disaffection for the ruler. Whatever be 
  the motive of the emperor, be it enrichment of his treasury, prolongation or 
  permanence of the Mughal rule, we Bengali people were enriched with a calendar 
  of permanence.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The Bengali Calendar (Bangla Sone/Sal) comes of a respectable family i.e. 
  it is proud of a rich heritage, of a distinguished origin. The words &quot;Sone&quot; 
  and &quot;Tarikh'' are derived from Arabic meaning year or calendar, and day 
  respectively, &quot;Tarikh&quot; also means history. The word &quot;Sal&quot; is also of foreign 
  origin, being a Persian word meaning year. Similarly, the Bengali Calendar has 
  its origin in the Arabic Calendar, precisely known as Hijri Calendar that is 
  an insignia of the great event of the migration in 622 A.D. of the greatest 
  man the world has ever produced-the holy Prophet (Sm.) from Makkah, his land 
  of birth, to Madinah to hold aloft the banner of Islam in obedience to the 
  command of the Creator.<br>
  </p>
  <p>A happy coincidence marks the origin of both these Bengali and Hijri 
  years-they both are christened with antedated seniority. The Hijri year was 
  not introduced instantly with the migration of the holy Prophet form Makkah to 
  Madianah on July 16, 662 A.D. It was Hazrat Omar, the second Caliph of Islam, 
  who introduced it in 638 A.D. after 16 years of the Hjirat (Migration). The 
  Hijri year began to be counted and made effective from the first day of 
  Muharram - the first day of the then current Arabic year, not from the exact 
  date of the Hijrat on the 12th of Rabiul Awal i.e. it was 16 years old at its 
  introduction. The Bengali year bears close resemblances in all its detail with 
  the Hijri year so far as its origin is concerned. The Bengali year was 
  introduced antedated like its progenitor the Hijri year when the later was 998 
  years old in 1584 A.D. after 28 years of Akber's ascent to the throne of Delhi 
  (1556 A.D). As in the case of Hijri, the Bengali year began to be counted and 
  made effective not from when Baishakh exactly started but the 1st of Muharram 
  of 963 Hijri (the year of Akbor's ascent to the throne of the Mughal empire 
  (14.02.1556) did not come into consideration, instead the year and the Hijri 
  month were effected while introducing the Bengali year keeping the Hijri year 
  and date in tact giving antedated seniority of 963 years i.e. the Bengali year 
  was made 963 B.S. at the start instead of counting it as 1 (one) B.S.<br>
  </p>
  <p>It is common knowledge that the Bengali year was introduced for the purpose 
  of collecting rent effectively and easily following harvesting season when the 
  peasantry would be relatively sound in financial position. Whatever be the 
  motive behind introduction of the Bengali year, whatever commercial instincts 
  came to play in its initiation, the net profit of the Bengalis is that they 
  could be proud of having possessed a year and Calendar of their own. In 
  keeping as it was with the harvesting season it initially came to be known as 
  'Fasali Sone' (the harvesting calender). Introduced though the 'Fasali Sone' 
  was in other Subas (provinces) during the reign of Akbar, they came to an end 
  with the end of the mughal rule. But the Bengali year came to sustain and 
  sustain it did though Bengla had to sustain subjugation under several dynastic 
  and colonial rules.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>During the reign of Akbar, Bengal came under the mughal rule. Complications 
  were however, noticed in rent administration. In those days crops were paid as 
  rent and as such particular month need to be fixed for collection of rent in 
  keeping with the harvesting season. But the Hijri 'Sone' then effective being 
  lunar year, the same month did not occur in the harvesting seasons, for a 
  lunar year consists of 354 days whereas a solar one of 365 days. For example, 
  we had to observe the Edul Azha in February this year (2002) but in March in 
  1999. The remedy to the problem necessitated the evolving of a solar calendar 
  out of the lunar one then in currency.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>Akbar entrusted the royal astrologer Amir Fatehullah Seraji to do the job. 
  With the arduous exercise of his intellect, scholarship and acumen he could 
  innovate the 'Fasali Sone' in keeping with the harvesting season to facilitate 
  effective collection of land tax. This 'Fasali Sone' was christened as 'Bangla 
  Sone' accordingly as it was introduced in Suba-e-Bangla (the province of 
  Bengal).<br>
  </p>
  <p>Originated though it was in the Hijri year, the Bangla Sone (the Bengali 
  year) is a remarkable departure from the parent Hijra, for the Hijra is a 
  lunar year while the 'Bangla Sone' is a solar year. This departure, basic and 
  preponderating, has caused a difference in the peace of movement of the two 
  types of years. The result is that the Hijra has outstripped the solar year by 
  14 years i.e. the 'Bangli Sone' is now 1409 and the Hijra 1423, though they 
  both began their journey form the same point of time, i.e. July 16, 622 A.D. 
  The solar year, we know, consists of 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 46 seconds 
  while the lunar year spans over 354 days 8 hours 53 seconds. This shortage of 
  nearly 11 days in the lunar years has hastened the movement of the Hijri by 14 
  more years than the Bangla Sone. Thus it is established that the Bengali 
  Calendar is a conglomerate of the lunar and solar years the Hijri and 
  Gregorian Calendars reaping the harvest of both the systems to our benefit.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>The Bengali Calendar was further modified and deflawed by a Committee 
  headed by the celebrated scholar Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah under the auspices 
  of the Bangla Academy in 1967 AP. The Committee made the following 
  recommendations in consideration of the different problems and their solutions 
  with reference to our culture and tradition in the context of the involvement 
  of rural life due to changes of months and seasons.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(a) The first five months of the year from Baishakh to Bhadra will be of 31 
  one days' duration each.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(b) The remaining seven months of the year with effect from Aswin to 
  Chaitra will consists of 30 days each.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(c) The 366th days after each fourth year will constitute what is known as 
  a leap year which shall occur in the month of Falgaun corresponding to the 
  month of February of the leap year in the Gregorian Calendar called as the 
  English Calendar in popular parlance. Falgun will, therefore, have 31 days in 
  the leap-year.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These recommendations voiced the need of the hour and of life and having 
  been implemented they have brought in adjustment and correspondence of the 
  different important dates of the Bengali Calendar with those of the Gregorian 
  one that is in vogue in the country. Now the Bengali New Year (the 1st of 
  Baishakh) correspondences with April 14, the Shahid Day (Martrys, Day on 21st 
  February) with 9th Falgun, the Independence Day (26th March) with 12th 
  Chairtra and the Victory Day (16th December) with 2nd Paush.<br>
  <br>
  As has been told before the BS (Bangabda) was made effective since 1556 A.D., 
  the year Akber ascended the throne of the Mughal empire. The various calendars 
  like Lakshmanabda, Bikramabda, Jalali Sone, Sekender Sone, Shakabda, Guptabda 
  etc. were then in use in the subcontinent. These different calendars were used 
  in different parts of the empire making it necessary for a uniform calendar in 
  all parts of the sub-continent and to cater to this necessity the 'Fasali 
  Sone' came into being but they were not uniformly practiced in the vast 
  territories of the empire. The calendar that was innovated at Akber's instance 
  is, indeed, a unique conglomerate of the three partners in the calculation of 
  the year in the sub-continent-the Bengali months, the Hijri Calendar and the 
  Gregorian Calendar. This found general and spontaneous acceptance in Bengla 
  but not so in other parts of the empire leaving it out of use there as many of 
  the calendars mentioned above and practiced earlier in Bengal went out of 
  vogue and ceased to exist. The different calendars that were used in Bengal 
  clearly appeared to have been named after particular area, ruler, dynasty etc; 
  but the 'Bangabda' is named after the whole land and relates with the entire 
  populace. It is our own. It is inextricably weaned with our culture and life, 
  its acceptance and continuity pointing to the essential democratic ideal that 
  our people cherish so ardently in their mind they accept and give currency to 
  what serves the interest of the entire nation, not the parochial interest. We 
  cannot but take pride in the facility of this democratic ideal. A legacy of 
  the rich Bengali, Roman, British civilizations and at the top of all the 
  Islamic civilization, the Bengali Calendar is, no doubt, our proud possession. 
  The 'Bangla Sone' (BS) is proudly adorned with Shakespearean beauty, rather it 
  is creditably crowned with Shakespearean success as having derived from 
  different sources it has been wholly and solely our own in the way the 
  greatest dramatist of the world has done by the skillful handling of his 
  source materials.<br>

<p>Apparent from the names of months the calendar is not just a &quot;gift&quot; of the 
&quot;Muslim civilization&quot;. It was the Indian calendar that Akbar used and maybe made 
a few alterations here and there. He apparently also just designated the start 
point. Also note the Sri Lankan new years is right before the Bengali (13th) the 
Nepali just before that 12th. Did the Muslims give the gift of the Nepali and 
Sri Lankan calendar aswell? </p>
<p>Rather the calendar is reformed from the old calendar </p>

    <h1>Indian calendar</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>As a result of a calendar reform in 1957 C.E., the National Calendar of 
      India is a formalized lunisolar calendar in which leap years coincide with 
      those of the Gregorian calendar (Calendar Reform Committee, 1957). 
      However, the initial epoch is the Saka Era, a traditional epoch of Indian 
      chronology. Months are named after the traditional Indian months and are 
      offset from the beginning of Gregorian months (see the table below).</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>In addition to establishing a civil calendar, the Calendar Reform 
      Committee set guidelines for religious calendars, which require 
      calculations of the motions of the Sun and Moon. Tabulations of the 
      religious holidays are prepared by the India Meteorological Department and 
      published annually in <em>The Indian Astronomical Ephemeris</em>.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>Despite the attempt to establish a unified calendar for all of India, 
      many local variations exist. The Gregorian calendar continues in use for 
      administrative purposes, and holidays are still determined according to 
      regional, religious, and ethnic traditions.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <h3>Rules for civil use</h3>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>Years are counted from the Saka Era; 1 Saka is considered to begin with 
      the vernal equinox of C.E. 79. The reformed Indian calendar began with 
      Saka Era 1879, Caitra 1, which corresponds to C.E. 1957 March 22. Normal 
      years have 365 days; leap years have 366. In a leap year, an intercalary 
      day is added to the end of Caitra. To determine leap years, first add 78 
      to the Saka year. If this sum is evenly divisible by 4, the year is a leap 
      year, unless the sum is a multiple of 100. In the latter case, the year is 
      not a leap year unless the sum is also a multiple of 400. Table 5.1.1 
      gives the sequence of months and their correlation with the months of the 
      Gregorian calendar.</p>

      <h3>Principles of the religious calendar</h3>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>Religious holidays are determined by a lunisolar calendar that is based 
      on calculations of the actual postions of the Sun and Moon. Most holidays 
      occur on specified lunar dates (<em>tithis</em>), as is explained later; a 
      few occur on specified solar dates. The calendrical methods presented here 
      are those recommended by the Calendar Reform Committee (1957). They serve 
      as the basis for the calendar published in <em>The Indian Astronomical 
      Ephemeris</em>. However, many local calendar makers continue to use 
      traditional astronomical concepts and formulas, some of which date back 
      1500 years.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>The Calendar Reform Committee attempted to reconcile traditional 
      calendrical practices with modern astronomical concepts. According to 
      their proposals, precession is accounted for and calculations of solar and 
      lunar position are based on accurate modern methods. All astronomical 
      calculations are performed with respect to a Central Station at longitude 
      82°30' East, latitude 23°11' North. For religious purposes solar days are 
      reckoned from sunrise to sunrise.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>A solar month is defined as the interval required for the Sun's 
      apparent longitude to increase by 30o, corresponding to the passage of the 
      Sun through a zodiacal sign (<em>rasi</em>). The initial month of the 
      year, Vaisakha, begins when the true longitude of the Sun is 23° 15' (see 
      Table below). Because the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the lengths of the 
      months vary from 29.2 to 31.2 days. The short months all occur in the 
      second half of the year around the time of the Earth's perihelion passage.</p>

      <p><img alt hspace="10" src="indianwalk.jpg" align="right" vspace="10" width="170" height="114">At 
      right, Rajputs are leading a camel herd to Pushkar, India. Each year 
      during Kartik Purnima, which is the full moon in the Indian calendar month 
      of Kartika, thousands of Rajputs lead their camels across the desert to 
      the town of Pushkar for the annual camel fair. They come to sell, buy, and 
      trade animals.</p>

    <ul>
      <p>Lunar months are measures from one New Moon to the next (although some 
      groups reckon from the Full Moon). Each lunar month is given the name of 
      the solar month in which the lunar month begins. Because most lunations 
      are shorter than a solar month, there is occasionally a solar month in 
      which two New Moons occur. In this case, both lunar months bear the same 
      name, but the first month is described with the prefix <em>adhika</em>, or 
      intercalary. Such a year has thirteen lunar months. <em>Adhika</em> months 
      occur every two or three years following patterns described by the Metonic 
      cycle or more complex lunar phase cycles.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>More rarely, a year will occur in which a short solar month will pass 
      without having a New Moon. In that case, the name of the solar month does 
      not occur in the calendar for that year. Such a decayed (<em>ksaya</em>) 
      month can occur only in the months near the Earth's perihelion passage. In 
      compensation, a month in the first half of the year will have had two New 
      Moons, so the year will still have twelve lunar months. <em>Ksaya</em> 
      months are separated by as few as nineteen years and as many as 141 years.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>Lunations are divided into 30 <em>tithis</em>, or lunar days. Each <em>
      tithi</em> is defined by the time required for the longitude of the Moon 
      to increase by 12o over the longitude of the Sun. Thus the length of a <em>
      tithi</em> may vary from about 20 hours to nearly 27 hours. During the 
      waxing phases, <em>tithis</em> are counted from 1 to 15 with the 
      designation <em>Sukla</em>. <em>Tithis</em> for the waning phases are 
      designated <em>Krsna</em> and are again counted from 1 to 15. Each day is 
      assigned the number of the <em>tithi</em> in effect at sunrise. 
      Occasionally a short <em>tithi</em> will begin after sunrise and be 
      completed before the next sunrise. Similarly a long <em>tithi</em> may 
      span two sunrises. In the former case, a number is omitted from the day 
      count. In the latter, a day number is carried over to a second day.</p>

      <h3>History of the Indian calendar</h3>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>The history of calendars in India is a remarkably complex subject owing 
      to the continuity of Indian civilization and to the diversity of cultural 
      influences. In the mid-1950s, when the Calendar Reform Committee made its 
      survey, there were about 30 calendars in use for setting religious 
      festivals for Hindus, Buddhists, and Jainists. Some of these were also 
      used for civil dating. These calendars were based on common principles, 
      though they had local characteristics determined by long-established 
      customs and the astronomical practices of local calendar makers. In 
      addition, Muslims in India used the Islamic calendar, and the Indian 
      government used the Gregorian calendar for administrative purposes.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>Early allusions to a lunisolar calendar with intercalated months are 
      found in the hymns from the Rig Veda, dating from the second millennium 
      B.C.E. Literature from 1300 B.C.E. to C.E. 300, provides information of a 
      more specific nature. A five-year lunisolar calendar coordinated solar 
      years with synodic and sidereal lunar months.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>Indian astronomy underwent a general reform in the first few centuries 
      C.E., as advances in Babylonian and Greek astronomy became known. New 
      astronomical constants and models for the motion of the Moon and Sun were 
      adapted to traditional calendric practices. This was conveyed in 
      astronomical treatises of this period known as <em>Siddhantas</em>, many 
      of which have not survived. The <em>Surya Siddhanta</em>, which originated 
      in the fourth century but was updated over the following centuries, 
      influenced Indian calendrics up to and even after the calendar reform of 
      C.E. 1957.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p>The author Pingree provides a survey of the development of mathematical 
      astronomy in India. Although he does not deal explicitly with calendrics, 
      this material is necessary for a full understanding of the history of 
      India's calendars.</p>
