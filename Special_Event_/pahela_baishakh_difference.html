  <p>Dear Mukto-Monas,</p>
  <p align="justify">The Bengali New Year day is on the door. Happy new year to
  you all - '<i>Shubho Nababarsha</i>'. My thoughts on this day are reflected in
  the following write up.</p>
  <p>Ajoy Roy</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">Just one hour, BD time, away I am waiting
  for Pahela Baishakh of 1409 BS. But I am not celebrating it. It is a pahela
  Baishakh with a difference to me. My memory goes back to last year's event at
  Bata Mula of Ramna Green. The day was also a most pathetic day for me on
  personal level. While the horrific bomb blasting was taking place at the
  Batamul at the time when artists were ushering the first day of 1408 with the
  famous song of Rabindranath's '<i>Esho he Baishakh</i>'</font></p>

  <p>[ my apology to non Bengali muktomonas as I wouldn't attempt to translate
  the poem in English]</p>

  <p align="justify"><font size="3">I was not at the Batamula. I was 5-Km away
  from batamul to a burning-ghat (cremation bank) - a place called 'Badeswari'
  about a kilometer from the Kamalapur Boudha Monastery. I was then putting my
  dear daughter in law on a fireplace to be burnt to ashes. We then assembled
  round the fireplace to pay our last tribute and respect to her as the fire was
  ignited. At that very moment we heard that severe bomb blasts took place at
  the Batmul function- some were killed on the spot and many severely injured.
  What a sad coincidence, I thought at that time. But let me not bore you with
  my personal loss. The loss of those lives on this august day is much more
  lamentable.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">Lest we forget those unfortunate victims.
  No, we have not called them Shaheeds, as they were not as great as Zia. As I
  recall today on the verge of a new '<i>new year's day</i>' the event was a
  direct challenge to our concept of Bengali-ism as against <i>'Bangladeshi'-ism</i>
  , first coined by late Abul Mansur, then given a theocratic basis by a
  journalist named Khondakar Abdul Hamid (alias <i>Marde-Momin</i> ) and finally
  adopted by General Zia who later on through a martial law decree incorporated
  into our 72-Constitution. The term was coined in place of 'Bengali-ism' in
  order to indicate that &quot;peoples Republic of Bangladesh ' is not a
  'secular Bangla', on the contrary we are citizens of 'Muslim Bangla'. Whether
  it is a moderate Muslim Bangla or a Fundamentalist Muslim Bangla on that point
  we may debate but not on Muslim Bangla'. This is the basis of BNP political
  philosophy, system and policy. The BNP leadership including Begum Khaleda
  despise secularism as much as Sayeedi or Jamat leadership.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">We have forgotten those who gave up their
  lives on that fearful day. AL government, at the fag end of their tenure,
  denounced it as action of pro fundamentalists. Secularists saw it as a
  challenge to secular values by the fundamentalist and obscurations force(s)
  that were gradually taking strong footing at the soil of Bangladesh. But the
  then opposition leader Khaleda Zia pictured it as AL's own transplantation.
  What kind of logic it is I did not understand then, nor do I understand her
  majesty's (our PM) language now.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">But who were killed and injured on that day?
  Let us pay our tributes to them: 9 were killed on the spot and instantly, and
  another girl met her death at Dhaka medical college hospital on the following
  day. At least 30 persons were injured of whom 10 became disabled. But what
  happened next. That is a different story.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <u>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">The Police case</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  </u>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">Police on its own registered two cases: One
  in relation to killing, -, other one related to 'causing explosion in public
  place'. It is learnt that police within a very short time arrested 12 persons
  in connection of the case including a Madrasa teacher, Janab Akbar Hosain of
  Madani nagar Madrasa. According the police source the investigation was
  complete long time back and charge sheets on both cases are complete. But as
  green signal is not given by the higher police authority the investigation
  officer of DB, Mr. Akheteruzzaman could not submit it to the court. He said
  that to formulate charge sheets against the accused they have enough
  information, facts and witnesses. The investigation revealed sufficient proofs
  regarding involvement of 4 arrested persons. They are Moulana Akbar Hosain,
  Shaikh Farid, Abdur Rauf, and Mufti Abdul Hai. The main leader, according to
  police, Moulana Akbar admitted his involvement in that case and named four
  others. Police however failed to trace rest six.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">With the change of power at the state level,
  the case was almost shelved. No further progress was mad except that all 12
  accused were set free on bail(s). However the investigation officer is
  confident that he could submit the charge sheets the moment he gets green
  signal from his superior. He is waiting for their instruction. He further
  opined all arrested persons are fundamentalists, as they are opposed to
  observe Pahela Baishakh as the function is anti Islamic. In the mean while on
  the appeal of the accused persons to abandon the case as it lost its
  credibility, the high court issued an order to the lower court to keep
  suspended its proceedings so far this case is concerned.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">According to the source of higher police
  authority, they are waiting the completion of the enquiry commission's
  findings, recently constituted by the government to probe into the event. Then
  the police would think of submitting charge sheets or starting fresh enquiry.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <u>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">Constitution of Enquiry Commission</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  </u>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">The BNP government recently constituted a 3
  men commission headed by a retired justice of high court Janab Abdul Bari and
  two other members, Mr. Mustafizur Rahman, additional secretary of home, and
  Mr. AKM Kamaluddin, joint secretary, LGR ministry, The commission is to probe
  the event in order to identify the culprits and submit its recommendation
  within 30<sup>th</sup> September. But question is: is the commission capable
  of doing it. Do they have necessary means, techniques and methodology to bring
  to surface not only Ramna event but such other events including the bomb blast
  at Narayanganj AL office just a few days before election. Or it is just an
  eyewash and a device to save the fundamentalists from the law and justice. I
  wonder. As is reported, commission is facing enormous difficulty as except the
  relatives of the accused no body is coming forward to give evidence. The
  reason is clear - the people have no confidence on the commission.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">Under this backdrop the pahela baisak is
  arriving. The government is preparing 'not to observe the day in an
  enthusiastic manner', but they are busy in obtaining a tight security at the
  Batamul. Begum Khaleda has taken over the action of the police. She is acting
  as Super IG-, now directing the police how to act and how not act, giving
  advice to IG, DIG', SP's and even sepoys how to control the law order
  situation. It seems we need no training institute, police academy, no
