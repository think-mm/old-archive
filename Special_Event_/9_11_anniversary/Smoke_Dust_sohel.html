  September 11, 2002</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This is undeniably the time for grief and mourning. The
  widow's reminiscing the last telephone calls from her husband trapped in one
  of the suicide plane crashed Twin Towers, the humbling violin sound, a tiny
  salute from a fatherless child amidst the windy New York city, are all the
  subtle reminders of the vastness of the calamity from last year's
  unforgettable terrorist attacks. America is in pain. America is in anguish.
  The people of America cannot forget the heartbreaking tragedy. America cries
  with resolved determination.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Yes, there are differences of opinions, views and
  philosophy among the world citizenry. And yes, there are the feelings of
  alienation in the international community arose from the recent world
  political developments. And still there are unified sadness amongst the people
  with varied religion and cultural customs. There are the synonymous feelings
  of antipathy against the terrorists of all kinds who have purported or
  assisted in massacring innocent people in the United States last year. Some of
  these terrorists are still hiding in the undiscovered caves, and some of them
  are residing in robust places around the world, snugly surrounded by their
  powerful peers and charlatans.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Terrorists have succeeded in their true agenda. They have
  succeeded in imprinting their mark of poisons among the livable consciousness
  of daily America. Not long after the Twin towers were collapsed, part of
  Pentagon was fractured and another plane crashed on the field of Pennsylvania;
  like the Muslim extremists, there were vengeful Christians, Jews and others
  with remarkably similar &quot;anti-infidel&quot; feelings came to the
  forefront, in the dark of the night, or in the broad day light, to show the
  naked power and hatred filled onslaught. A Sikh man was murdered just because
  he was wearing his turban, a Pakistani man was shot dead because of his
  religion and look, and there were countless other reported and unreported
  abuses, many of them are absorbed silently by the scared new immigrant
  population for the fear of further unjustified persecution.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Many of the brave Americans came forward as well. They
  have extended their kind hands to some of these terrified immigrants, who were
  predominantly Muslims. These kind hearted Americans have escorted the scarf
  wearing Muslim girls or bearded men to their work or schools, they have
  arranged community meetings where they have tried to disseminate brotherhood
  and sisterhood feelings in the community. And it is for these non-advertised
  Americans' relentless efforts and dedication for genuine goodness, many more
  abuses, tortures and discriminations of the immigrant population have been
  thwarted, to some degree, but not entirely. The hum of intolerance still lurks
  underneath the surface, especially when the question of further expanding war
  around the world are resurfacing like an uncontrolled mushroom cloud.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Visiting mosques and temples by the prominent leadership
  were the first good step, far away from crusade chattering, in delineating
  anti-Muslim feelings from America. Many wish that this could be done more
  often as the leadership goes to weekly Sunday church, one or two cabinet
  members could visit other religionists' prayers' places more often along with
  their scheduled news appearances. This could work in positive way in taking
  away misunderstandings among the Muslim Americans. This could assure many that
  the war against terrorism is really not against Islam or the vast majority of
  peace loving Muslims or turban wearing Sheikhs.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">America is built by the immigrants. Among the 3000 or
  more dead from last year's terrorist attacks, there were many first generation
  immigrants from around the world. There were Christians, Jews, Muslims,
  Hindus, Buddhists, Atheists, Agnostics and people with other belief systems of
  various national backgrounds. The terrorist attack was meant to destabilize
  America, to rouse one immigrant segments against another, and overall, its
  clever plan was to polarize our world further along the racial and religious
  line. Many writers observe that killing numerous innocent civilians in the
  faraway foreign lands in the name of &quot;war against terrorism&quot; by the
  vengeful parties were in terrorists' long-standing plan as well. And
  unfortunately, many detect that the West is dealing the card the way the
  terrorists wished them to deal the cards in complete synchronicity.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It is not the defiant neuralgic bombs and missiles or
  pristine military aircrafts filled with &quot;carpet bombing&quot; ferocity
  will ever defeat the terrorists, it's the international cooperation that is
  faraway from unilateral arrogance, and the concerted efforts dominated by
  social justice and equity away from the naked profitability schemes, can truly
  achieve the desired goals in stifling terrorism out of their unconquerable
  breeding places.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Let's the painful memory of September 11 and its
  aftermath remind us once again our unshakable commitment toward human rights,
  freedom and democracy for all, without holding any discriminatory
  reservations. This world is for every citizens, from the poor in Mandalay, to
  the repressed Bedouins of Arabian peninsula, to the railway coolies of Dhaka
  Kamalapur Station, the Dalits and Brahmans of Maharashtra, Chinese monks, to
  the blue eyed Irish, and the broad shouldered Americans and the cowboys
  Australians, the dancing Tongas and Congolese natives, to the Cubans and
  soccer crazed Brazilians, this is our world. And the only one world we have in
  our unimaginably short unpredictable life.<o:p>
