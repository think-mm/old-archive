  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today, on September 11, 2002, we are
  remembering the events of a day that went awry if you happened to be in the US
  on that fateful day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a day
  of bewildering confusion to put it mildly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Anyone who was old enough to remember what happened in the eastern
  seaboard of America, in the morning hours, when four commercial jetliners were
  hijacked by terrorists, would remember the events of the day for the rest of
  their life, which is mired in absolute infamy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Make no mistake about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  wrote earlier that a bewildering confusion had followed once the hijacking of
  the planes had started in the eastern seaboard.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I was driving my car to work at about
  8:15 in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I
  reached the hump of a bridge over Lake Ponchartrain, which is call Twin Span
  Bridge, I was listening to CNN report live from New York.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Normally at this time of the day, the CNN reports the business and
  other world news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But instead of
  broadcasting the regular news program, the CNN was reporting live from New
  York.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The reporters were nervous
  and one can tell that from their voice and speech pattern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>What I learned from the radio astounded me, to put it mildly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I learned that some unknown terrorists have hijacked multiple passenger
  jetliners from Boston and few other airports all located in the eastern
  seaboard. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>One of the hijacked
  planes has rammed one tower of the Twin Tower Building located in the south
  side of Manhattan in World Trade Center complex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>As the broadcasters were narrating the story from New York City, they
  screamed and holler to let us know that another plane has just hit the tower
  of the WTC building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only then,
  it became crystal clear that it was no accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>As I was driving another 30 minutes or so, I keep hearing in the radio
  newsmen describing yet another plane crash that just happened in the outskirts
  of Washington DC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the
  confusion that abounded in the morning time from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m. in the
  eastern seaboard, no one was sure what exactly was happening in New York City
  or in Washington DC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When I
  reached my office, which is a Federal Building, I saw the panic-stricken faces
  of many of my colleagues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
  was a giant screen TV at the basement of the building where quite a few of my
  coworkers were huddled to watch the TV.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, I went there to see for myself the extent of the
  damage that the WTC buildings took because of two explosions caused by the
  hijacked planes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A sad faced
  colleague told me that a portion of the Twin Tower Building had just
  collapsed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowing how many
  people work in that WTC complex and the time of the day, we all were saddened
  because we knew the casualty figure would run into thousands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The ramming of the Pentagon Building
  by the third hijacked plane was not fully known at 9:30 a.m. our time (10:30
  a.m. in the East Coast).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At about
  10:00 a.m. our building was shut down because of the heightened security
  measure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have friends working
  for the government in Washington DC area who also told me that most federal
  buildings were shut because of security concern.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>One may surmise therefore that the entire federal government from coast
  to coast was shut down as a fall out from hijacking of the planes and
  subsequent demolition of Twin Towers in NYC and a portion of Pentagon Building
  in the suburb of Washington DC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I reached home at about 10:45 a.m.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>On the way from my office to home, I tuned to our local affiliate radio
  station of the CNN.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Some new information on Pentagon Building demolition by one
  hijacked plane was still not being heard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>By noontime, we learned that a section of the Pentagon Building in the
  suburb of Washington was badly damaged as we saw in the TV screen plumes of
  smokes coming out of the demolished building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The fate of the fourth hijacked plane was not released at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Later in the afternoon, we heard that that plane crashed in rural
  Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh, which hundreds of miles away from the eastern
  seaboard.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Sometime in the noontime or a little
  later, we saw a nervous President addressing the TV from an Air Force base
  located in my home state of Louisiana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>According
  to the news story, President Bush was in Florida in that morning when the
  hijackers commandeered four passenger jetliners.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The security force that protects the US president flew George
  W. Bush to one undisclosed US Air Force base perhaps in the southern states
  and then took the president to Shreveport, Louisiana, where from Mr. Bush
  addressed the nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a
  very unusual press report by the president.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>And trust me, I have seen many presidents giving speech in the
  television starting from Richard M. Nixon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Mr. Bush was visibly shaken and so were the newsman and the handlers of
  the president.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The security force
  then took the president to another undisclosed Air Force base.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>On that fateful day, there weren’t any plane on the sky excepting the
  Air Force One and few military planes in American sky.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">In the early afternoon on September
  11, 2001, we were glued to the television screen at home.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Most network-affiliated stations have stopped showing their
  regular programs and instead they were giving news coverage of the
  unprecedented events of the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  strictly remember that CBS’s anchorperson Dan Rather narrating the scenes
  that were taken hours before near the WTC complex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>He warned us that some scenes contain words spoken by New Yorkers who
  saw one of the towers of WTC building come crashing down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>One man in the background described the scene extemporaneously giving
  an introduction that started like “Oh, f----king Jesus” while another
  woman nearby screaming her heart out in deep anguish. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>To
  sum up, it was an extraordinary news reporting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Most newscasters were interviewing law enforcement officers, firemen,
  etc., who they could find near the devastation site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We saw in the television panic-stricken men and women in business suit
  running like hell going away from the WTC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Some women had to forgo their pencil hill shoes because one barely
  could walk while wearing those sexy shoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Therefore, many high hill women’s shoes were seen scattered near the
  southside of Manhattan, which was the epicenter of devastation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The entire southside of Manhattan Island looked like a bombed out area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>There was no telling how many people have vanished as the two giant
  towers came tumbling down.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Speculations about the number of casualties were rife in the
  media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The newscasters were
  telling us the number could run as high as in the low five figures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Some experts were of the view that 20,000 to 30,000 people could have
  been trapped inside the WTC buildings as two planes rammed the two towers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The news about the fourth plane that
  crashed hundreds of miles to the west from New York City in rural Western
  Pennsylvania was shrouded in mystery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No
  one had any clues on September 11 how the jetliner came down and hit the land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Only thing we learned late in the afternoon that there were no
  survivors in that crash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  government was surely tightlipped about the third plane that demolished a
  section of the Pentagon Building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
  were told that fire was still raging at the crash site and many government
  office workers who were working inside the building were killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It was also evident that there were no survivors amongst the passengers
  of the hijacked planes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The other thing we learned on that
  fateful day that while the president was safe and sound, the vice president
  was whisked away to a safe place located underground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The government had to tell their employees in the morning to go home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It was widely feared that the unknown terrorists could target other
  government sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were many
  speculations about the identity of the terrorists by the news media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>No one was however brave enough to point fingers at any single
  terrorist organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
  it was mentioned in the network news that some frantic cellphone calls from
  the hijacked plane that would hit a segment of the Pentagon Building had
  identified the hijackers as Arabic speaking persons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The government spokesperson and other members of the Congress and the
  Senate were telling the media that whoever did this terrible thing to America
  would be hunted down and brought to justice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Speculations were rife that terrorists
  from Middle East may have engineered this disaster because of the suicidal
  nature of the operation and the earlier report that some hijackers of one
  particular plane were Arab looking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowing
  this vital information, the CBS news organization was quick to fetch their
  Middle East expert Professor Fouad Ajami to their New York studio from
  Baltimore, Maryland where he teaches at John Hopkins University.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the segment where Dan Rather talked to Prof. Ajami, it was
  mentioned that a repercussion against Muslim people might ensue if it turns
  out that the hijackers were Muslims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prof.
  Ajami correctly predicted this because in the aftermath of the first bombing
  of WTC building on February 26, 1993, some Muslims were subjected to verbal
  harassment and irate Americans threatened a few.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the magnitude of damage and loss of life on September
  11, 2001, pales the one that happened 8 years ago, i.e., the first bombing of
  the WTC, there is bound to be repercussion against Americans who look
  middle-eastern and Asian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The network television stations
  dutifully continued their nightlong coverage in the wee hours of September 12.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In the morning on Wednesday, we were not so sure, whether our office
  building would open for work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
  give the semblance of normalcy, the government decided to re-open the
  buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Extraordinary
  precautions however were taken for safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We were all required to wear id batch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>President Bush also returned to the White House on that day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The world that we live in had changed
  in many ways since 9-11 terrorist attacks took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Persons who are living tens of thousands of miles away in
  remote corners of Bangladesh, India, or Pakistan are also feeling the pinch of
  this manmade catastrophe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  event of day had surely pushed the world in the brink of a global recession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>How long will it take to get out of this mess is not known for sure?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>However, what we know for sure is this -- the day that put the world
  askew would remain in infamy for a long time to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
