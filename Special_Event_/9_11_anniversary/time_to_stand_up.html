  <p>&nbsp;
  <p>&quot;To blame Islam for what happened in New York is like blaming
  Christianity for the troubles in Northern Ireland!&quot; Yes. Precisely. It is
  time to stop pussyfooting around. Time to get angry. <b>And not only with
  Islam.</b></p>
  <p>Those of us who have renounced one or another of the three
  &quot;great&quot; monotheistic religions have, until now, moderated our
  language for reasons of politeness. Christians, Jews and Muslims are sincere
  in their beliefs and in what they find holy. We have respected that, even as
  we have disagreed with it. The late Douglas Adams put it with his customary
  good humor, in an <a href="http://www.biota.org/people/douglasadams/index.html">impromptu
  speech in 1998</a> (slightly abridged):
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    Now, the invention of the scientific method is, I'm sure we'll all agree,
    the most powerful intellectual idea, the most powerful framework for
    thinking and investigating and understanding and challenging the world
    around us that there is, and it rests on the premise that any idea is there
    to be attacked. If it withstands the attack then it lives to fight another
    day and if it doesn't withstand the attack then down it goes. Religion
    doesn't seem to work like that. It has certain ideas at the heart of it
    which we call sacred or holy or whatever. What it means is, &quot;Here is an
    idea or a notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about; you're
    just not. Why not?--because you're not!&quot; If somebody votes for a party
    that you don't agree with, you're free to argue about it as much as you
    like; everybody will have an argument but nobody feels aggrieved by it. If
    somebody thinks taxes should go up or down you are free to have an argument
    about it. But on the other hand if somebody says 'I mustn't move a light
    switch on a Saturday,' you say, &quot;I <i>respect</i> that.&quot;
    <p>The odd thing is, even as I am saying that, I am thinking &quot;Is there
    an Orthodox Jew here who is going to be offended by the fact that I just
    said that?&quot; But I wouldn't have thought &quot;Maybe there's somebody
    from the left wing or somebody from the right wing or somebody who
    subscribes to this view or the other in economics&quot; when I was making
    the other points. I just think &quot;Fine, we have different opinions.&quot;
    But, the moment I say something that has something to do with somebody's
    (I'm going to stick my neck out here and say irrational) beliefs, then we
    all become terribly protective and terribly defensive and say &quot;No, we
    don't attack that; that's an irrational belief but no, we respect it.&quot;
    <p>Why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the Labor
    party or the Conservative party, Republicans or Democrats, this model of
    economics versus that, Macintosh instead of Windows--but to have an opinion
    about how the Universe began, about who created the Universe . . . no,
    that's holy? What does that mean? Why do we ring-fence that for any other
    reason other than that we've just got used to doing so? There's no other
    reason at all, it's just one of those things that crept into being and once
    that loop gets going it's very, very powerful. So, we are used to not
    challenging religious ideas but it's very interesting how much of a furor
    Richard creates when he does it! Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it
    because you're not allowed to say these things. Yet when you look at it
    rationally there is no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate
    as any other, except that we have agreed somehow between us that they
    shouldn't be.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Douglas is dead, but I think he would join me in asking people now to stand
  up and break this absurd taboo. <b>My respect for the Abrahamic religions went
  up in the smoke and choking dust of September 11th. </b>The last vestige of
  respect for the taboo disappeared as I watched the &quot;Day of Prayer&quot;
  in Washington Cathedral, where people of mutually incompatible faiths united
  in homage to the very force that caused the problem in the first place:
  religion. It is time for people of intellect, as opposed to people of faith,
  to stand up and say &quot;Enough!&quot; Let our tribute to the dead be a new
  resolve: to respect <i>people</i> for what they individually <i>think,</i>
  rather than respect <i>groups</i> for what they were collectively brought up
  to <i>believe.</i>
  <p>Notwithstanding bitter sectarian hatreds over the centuries (all too
  obviously still going strong), Judaism, Islam and Christianity have much in
  common. Despite New Testament watering down and other reformist tendencies,
  all three pay historic allegiance to the same violent and vindictive God of
  Battles, memorably summed up by Gore Vidal in 1998:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    The great unmentionable evil at the center of our culture is monotheism.
    From a barbaric Bronze Age text known as the Old Testament, three anti-human
    religions have evolved--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These are sky-god
    religions. They are, literally, patriarchal--God is the Omnipotent
    Father--hence the loathing of women for 2,000 years in those countries
    afflicted by the sky-god and his earthly male delegates. The sky-god is a
    jealous god, of course. He requires total obedience from everyone on earth,
    as he is not just in place for one tribe, but for all creation. Those who
    would reject him must be converted or killed for their own good.
  </blockquote>
  <p>In <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4257777,00.html">The
  Guardian of 15th September</a>, I named belief in an afterlife as the key
  weapon that made the New York atrocity possible. Of prior significance is
  religion's deep responsibility for the underlying hatreds that motivated
  people to use that weapon in the first place. To breathe such a suggestion,
  even with the most gentlemanly restraint, is to invite an onslaught of
  patronizing abuse, as Douglas Adams noted. But the insane cruelty of the
  suicide attacks, and the equally vicious though numerically less catastrophic
  'revenge' attacks on hapless Muslims living in America and Britain, push me
  beyond ordinary caution.
  <p>How can I say that religion is to blame? Do I really imagine that, when a
  terrorist kills, he is motivated by a theological disagreement with his
  victim? Do I really think the Northern Ireland pub bomber says to himself
  &quot;Take that, Tridentine Transubstantiationist bastards!&quot; Of course I
  don't think anything of the kind. <b>Theology is the last thing on the minds
  of such people. They are not killing because of religion itself, but because
  of political grievances, often justified. They are killing because the other
  lot killed their fathers. Or because the other lot drove their great
  grandfathers off their land. Or because the other lot oppressed our lot
  economically for centuries.</b>
  <p><b><font color="#FF0000">My point is not that religion itself is the
  motivation for wars, murders and terrorist attacks, but that religion is the
  principal <i>label,</i> and the most dangerous one, by which a
  &quot;they&quot; as opposed to a &quot;we&quot; can be identified at all.</font></b>
  I am not even claiming that religion is the only label by which we identify
  the victims of our prejudice. There's also skin color, language, and social
  class. But often, as in Northern Ireland, these don't apply and religion is
  the only divisive label around. Even when it is not alone, religion is nearly
  always an incendiary ingredient in the mix as well.
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>It is not an exaggeration to say that religion is
  the most inflammatory enemy-labelling device in history. </b></font>Who killed
  your father? Not the individuals you are about to kill in 'revenge.' The
  culprits themselves have vanished over the border. The people who stole your
  great grandfather's land have died of old age. You aim your vendetta at those
  who belong to the same <i>religion</i> as the original perpetrators. It wasn't
  Seamus who killed your brother, but it was Catholics, so Seamus deserves to
  die &quot;in return.&quot; Next, it was Protestants who killed Seamus so let's
  go out and kill some Protestants &quot;in revenge.&quot; It was Muslims who
  destroyed the World Trade Center so let's set upon the turbaned driver of a
  London taxi and leave him paralyzed from the neck down.
  <p>The bitter hatreds that now poison Middle Eastern politics are rooted in
  the real or perceived wrong of the setting up of a Jewish State in an Islamic
  region. In view of all that the Jews had been through, it must have seemed a
  fair and humane solution. Probably deep familiarity with the Old Testament had
  given the European and American decision-makers some sort of idea that this
  really was the 'historic homeland' of the Jews (though the horrific stories of
  how Joshua and others conquered their <i>Lebensraum</i> might have made them
  wonder). Even if it wasn't justifiable at the time, no doubt a good case can
  be made that, since Israel exists now, to try to reverse the <i>status quo</i>
  would be a worse wrong.
  <p>I do not intend to get into that argument. But if it had not been for
  religion, the very concept of a Jewish state would have had no meaning in the
  first place. Nor would the very <i>concept</i> of Islamic lands, as something
  to be invaded and desecrated. In a world without religion, there would have
  been no Crusades; no Inquisition; no anti-Semitic pogroms (the people of the
  diaspora would long ago have intermarried and become indistinguishable from
  their host populations); no Northern Ireland Troubles (no label by which to
  distinguish the two 'communities,' and no sectarian schools to teach the
  children historic hatreds--they would simply be one community).
  <p>It is a spade we have here, let's <i>call</i> it a spade. The Emperor has
  no clothes. It is time to stop the mealy-mouthed euphemisms: 'Nationalists,'
  'Loyalists,' 'Communities,' 'Ethnic Groups.' <i>Religions</i> is the word you
  need. <i>Religion</i> is the word you are struggling hypocritically to avoid.
  <p>Parenthetically, religion is unusual among divisive labels in being
  spectacularly <i>unnecessary.</i> If religious beliefs had any evidence going
  for them, we might have to respect them in spite of their concomitant
  unpleasantness. But there is no such evidence. To label people as
  death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real world politics is
  bad enough. To do the same for disagreements about a delusional world
  inhabited by archangels, demons and imaginary friends is ludicrously tragic.
  <p>The resilience of this form of hereditary delusion is as astonishing as its
  lack of realism. It seems that control of the plane which crashed near
  Pittsburgh was probably wrestled out of the hands of the terrorists by a group
  of brave passengers. The wife of one of these valiant and heroic men, after
  she took the telephone call in which he announced their intention, said that
  God had placed her husband on the plane as His instrument to prevent the plane
  crashing on the White House. I have the greatest sympathy for this poor woman
  in her tragic loss, but just <i>think</i> about it! As my (also understandably
  overwrought) American correspondent who sent me this piece of news said:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    &quot;Couldn't God have just given the hijackers a heart attack or something
    instead of killing all those nice people on the plane? I guess he didn't
    give a flying fuck about the Trade Center, didn't bother to come up with a
    plan for them.&quot; (I apologize for my friend's intemperate language but,
    in the circumstances, who can blame her?)
  </blockquote>
  <p>Is there no catastrophe terrible enough to shake the faith of people, on
  both sides, in God's goodness and power? No glimmering realization that he
  might not be there at all: that we just might be on our own, needing to cope
  with the real world like grown-ups?
  <p>Billy Graham, Mr. Bush's spiritual advisor, said in Washington Cathedral:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    But how do we understand something like this? Why does God allow evil like
    this to take place? Perhaps that is what you are asking now. You may even be
    angry at God. I want to assure you that God understands those feelings that
    you may have.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Well, that's big of God, I must say. I'm sure that makes the bereaved feel
  a whole lot better (the pathetic thing is, it probably does!). Mr. Graham went
  on:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    I have been asked hundreds of times in my life why God allows tragedy and
    suffering. I have to confess that I really do not know the answer totally,
    even to my own satisfaction. I have to accept, by faith, that God is
    sovereign, and He is a God of love and mercy and compassion in the midst of
    suffering. The Bible says God is not the author of evil. It speaks of evil
    as a &quot;mystery.&quot;
  </blockquote>
  <p>Less baffled by this deep theological mystery were two of America's
  best-known televangelists, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. In a conversation
  on Robertson's lucrative television show (religion is tax-exempt), they knew <i>exactly</i>
  where to put the blame. The whole thing was obviously caused by America's <i>sin.</i>
  Falwell said that God had protected America wonderfully for 225 years, but
  now, what with abortion and gays and lesbians and the ACLU, &quot;all of them
  who have tried to secularize America . . . I point the finger in their face
  and say you helped this happen.&quot; &quot;Well, I totally concur,&quot;
  responded Robertson. Bush, to his credit, swiftly disowned this characteristic
  example of the religious mind at work.
  <p>The United States is the most religiose country in the Western world, and
  its born-again Christian leader is eyeball to eyeball with the most religiose
  people on Earth. Both sides believe that the Bronze Age God of Battles is on
  their side. Both take risks with the world's future in unshakeable,
  fundamentalist faith that He will grant them the victory. <b>Incidentally,
  people speak of Islamic Fundamentalists, but the customary genteel distinction
  between fundamentalist and moderate Islam has been convincingly demolished by
  Ibn Warraq in his well-informed book, <i><a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/book_review/why_i_am_not_a_muslim_rev.htm">Why
  I Am Not a Muslim</a>.</i></b>
  <p>The human psyche has two great sicknesses: the urge to carry vendetta
  across generations, and the tendency to fasten group labels on people rather
  than see them as individuals. Abrahamic religion gives strong sanction to
  both--and mixes explosively with both. Only the willfully blind could fail to
  implicate the divisive force of religion in most, if not all, of the violent
  enmities in the world today. Without a doubt it is the prime aggravator of the
  Middle East. <font color="#FF0000"><b>Those of us who have for years politely
  concealed our contempt for the dangerous collective delusion of religion need
  to stand up and speak out. Things are different now. &quot;All is changed,
  changed utterly.&quot;</b></font>
