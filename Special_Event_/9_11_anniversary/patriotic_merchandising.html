  <p>Time surely passes by very fast.&nbsp; It seems as if 9/11 tragedy struck
  America not too long ago.&nbsp; At first when the Arab terrorists hijacked
  four commercial jetliners from four airports in eastern seaboards of America
  and commandeered the planes towards Twin Towers and Pentagon Building, most
  Americans had the faintest of idea how big the tragedy would turn up in just
  short few days.&nbsp; Since the western news media have an amazing appetite
  for finding new information on any subject, they dug deeper into 9/11
  tragedies.&nbsp; Soon it was unearthed that 19 Arab terrorists belonging to
  al-Qaeda organization of Osama bin Laden had engineered this awful manmade
  disaster in the heartland of free world.&nbsp; When this news was confirmed,
  there was an outrage all over America to teach the nation that gave sanctuary
  to Osama bin Laden who was considered the mastermind behind this tragedy.&nbsp;
  President George W. Bush had to do something on the face of growing public
  demand for teaching the perpetrators of this heinous crime.&nbsp; It just took
  6 weeks of rapid preparation for America to start aerial bombardment of
  Afghanistan, which was then controlled by Mullah Omar and his trusted
  lieutenants belonging to Taliban faction of Islamic fundamentalist political
  organization.&nbsp; While the Mullahs in Afghanistan and neighboring countries
  had thought that God Himself would intervene to thwart the war efforts of
  America, the devastating firepower of massive ‘Daisy Cutter’ bombs was
  soon found to be no match against Mullahs cumulative prayer and supplicatory
  exercises.&nbsp; The vestiges of Talibanism were removed in a short notice
  from Afghanistan.&nbsp; Thanks to George W. Bush’s policy “Either you are
  with us or you are with the terrorists,” which he delivered at the ‘Joint
  Session of Congress and the American People’ on September 20, 2001.&nbsp;
  Although, rest of the world heaved a deep sigh of relief at the prompt action
  of George W. Bush, both Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar reportedly slipped
  away into a neighboring country where Islamists would give them a safe haven.

  A kiosk in Wal-Mart store showing some patriotic merchandise</font></b>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now that the first anniversary of 9/11 tragedy is approaching fast on
  earthlings, a plethora of activities is planned in the West to remember the
  day of infamy in which thousands of New Yorkers simply vanished within hours
  after two hijacked planes rammed the Twin Towers that stood on the ground
  majestically.&nbsp; If someone now looks at the skyline of Manhattan from
  Brooklyn, Staten Island, or from the shores of New Jersey, he or she would
  sorely miss the familiar Twin Towers that was built in the late 1960s and made
  operational in the early 1970s.&nbsp; An intense debate is taking place in
  America centering on what to do with the precious land on which the World
  Trade Center used to stand for nearly three decades until September 11, 2001.
  <p>Americans are very upset over the Arab terrorists’ activity on the Black
  Tuesday.&nbsp; The Twin Towers were considered an icon of America’s success.&nbsp;
  Similar to the Empire State Building located in the same island of Manhattan
  the Twin Towers were also considered a landmark and an epitome of success.&nbsp;
  America literally became the center of business world worldwide.&nbsp; Other
  nations were simply envious because of America’s rapid rise to stardom,
  metaphorically speaking of course.&nbsp; The Twin Tower building was located
  proximity to The Wall Street, which is home to NYSE and AMEX, the two citadels
  of financial power.&nbsp; Thus, when terrorists struck the World Trade Complex
  of buildings in the morning of September 11, 2001, Americans thought that
  their nation was under attack.&nbsp; Only other time that had happened was the
  attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese on December 7, 1941.&nbsp; By perusing the
  history of WWII, we learn that America joined the Allied Force only after
  being attacked by the Japanese on that fateful day.&nbsp; This time also
  America went after the Talibans in Afghanistan only because they gave a safe
  haven to al-Qaeda financier Osama bin Laden.&nbsp; Now that September 11,
  2002, is fast approaching on us and the Americans would remember the day’s
  event in somber mood along side with the rest of the world, the merchandiser
  of America is taking the full advantage of it.&nbsp; Let me tell you what I
  found just the other day visiting my local Wal-Mart store.
  <p align="center">&nbsp;<img src="patriot_15.JPG" border="0" width="357" height="360"><center><b><font face="Garamond"><br>
  Mrs. Lynne Cheney, wife of Vice President Dick Cheney wrote this patriotic
  primer</font></b></center> <center>&nbsp;</center>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For those of you who do not know what Wal-Mart is, here is this primer.&nbsp;
  In America, many discount stores sell an entire slue of merchandise.&nbsp;
  These stores are dubbed discount merchandiser because they sell things that we
  need for our everyday life at a discount price.&nbsp; The king of discount
  merchandiser was K-Mart.&nbsp; However, when a small discount merchandiser
  from a rural Arkansas by the name Wal-Mart started their business, they made a
  huge success.&nbsp; I first encountered a Wal-Mart store in 1985 when I moved
  to New Orleans area from Urbana, Illinois.&nbsp; Even though the store carries
  myriad foreign manufactured goods mostly from China, they tout often that they
  only sell American made merchandise.&nbsp; During the Persian Gulf War time in
  1991, I used to see the Wal-Mart stores brazenly decorate their stores with
  American flags and posting messages everywhere about their unfailing support
  for Operation Desert Storm, a euphemism for War against Saddam’s army.&nbsp;
  There must be hundreds of these over patriotic Wal-Mart stores if not
  thousands all across America.&nbsp; In fact, a visit to any of these Wal-Mart
  stores could be quite an experience for someone who is visiting America for
  the very first time.&nbsp; For shopping, Wal-Mart could be considered a
  microcosm for the entire America.<br>

  <p>A month before 9/11 anniversary would start the Wal-Mart stores all over
  America started to stock up on items related to this anniversary date.&nbsp;
  First, I noticed that as one would enter the front gate, a kiosk was set to
  display many items including propaganda-type books written by many faceless
  writers.&nbsp; Of course, one would see many flags of different sizes for
  sale.&nbsp; I know many immigrant families who are displaying the flags
  bearing thirteen stripes and fifty stars attaching these to their car’s
  windshield, outside their apartment and home for the fear that someone may
  think that they are not patriotic enough.&nbsp; The king of discount
  merchandiser, Wal-Mart, knows that there are many Americans who might buy
  these patriotic merchandises to show their support for President George
  Bush’s get tough policy with the nations that harbor Islamic terrorists
  including al-Qaeda and other fringe groups. Moreover, the Wal-Mart management
  also knows this for a fact that patriotism is on the rise in America ever
  since devastating terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, took place in New
  York City and outskirts of Washington DC.&nbsp; It is logical therefore to
  take advantage of this growing patriotism and at the same time make some easy
  bucks.&nbsp; In essence, some powerhouse retailers in America such as Wal-Mart
  believe in the axiom “what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
  gander.”&nbsp; In America, there is no dearth of ghostwriters.&nbsp; These
  scribes have written many a good number of short books in which the patriotic
  fervor was incited.&nbsp; Whether this unusual show of patriotism on the part
  of Americans is a good thing or not for world peace is debatable no doubt, but
  America as a global leader for the free world bears some responsibility to
  make sure that our world is not polarized into groups such as “either you
  are with us or you are with the terrorists.”
  <p>These are the newly published patriotic books that Wal-Mart is promoting
  these days: 1. “America: A Patriotic Primer” written by none other than
  Lynne Cheney, the wife of Vice President Dick Cheney;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Thomas
  Kinkade’s “Land that I love”; 3. “Faces of Ground Zero.&nbsp;
  Portraits of the heroes of September 11, 2001” written by Joe McNally; 4.&nbsp;
  “Standing Together - America Strong and Proud after 9.11” - A collection
  of photographs from daily news; 5. “God Bless America—Prayers &amp;
  Reflections for our country”; 6. Under “One Nation Under God” series,
  one could find 5 books entitled: “Honors those who serve,” “Through the
  eyes of a child,” “The Promise of America,” “”Wisdom made in
  America,” and “Kneels of Prayer.”<br>

  <p>Many decent Americans not only detest but also abhor the idea of turning
  this democracy into a hate-laden warmongering nation through publishing the
  above-mentioned patriotic books.&nbsp; George W. Bush and his trusted advisors
  are of the view that a permanent peace will only descend on us if we can
  remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.&nbsp; I am afraid all these show of
  burning patriotism as conjured up by Wal-Mart and other discount merchandisers
  in America to fatten their corporate purse would be counter productive in the
  long run.&nbsp; Many pundits and freethinkers saw danger in overt patriotism
  and they were not afraid at all to demonize it. For example, the eighteenth
  century English writer and lexicographer Dr. Samuel Johnson was erudite enough
  to have written a scathing remark on patriotism that goes as follows -
  “Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.”&nbsp; Now after all these
  years the corporate America has forgotten this axiomatic remark of this sage
  whose contribution to English speaking nations can hardly be denied (Dr.
  Johnson penned in 1755 “Dictionary of the English Language”).
  <p>Dr. Johnson or the French eminent critique Guy de Maupassant is not the
  only one to notice a danger in overt patriotism.&nbsp; Nineteenth century
  American philosopher and the central figure of American transcendentalism
  movement Ralph Waldo Emerson also noticed the dark side of unrestrained
  patriotism.&nbsp; Thus he wrote in his ‘Journal’: “When a whole nation
  is roaring Patriotism at the top of its voice, I am fain to explore the
  cleanness of its hands and purity of its heart.”
  <p>John E.E.D. Acton, a prominent British historian of his time who led
  English Roman Catholics in their opposition to the doctrine of papal
  infallibility also wrote: “Patriotism is in political life what faith is in
  religion” (quoted in 'Nationality', in 'The Home and Foreign Review', July
  1862).&nbsp; Finally, yet importantly, Roman stoic philosopher and writer
  Seneca also made a harsh comment against overt patriotism.&nbsp; He thus wrote
  in ‘Letters to Lucilius’: “No one loves his country for its size or
  eminence, but because it is his own.”<br>

  <p>In summary, this scribe has seen over the last one year ever since a great
  tragedy had struck America on September 11, 2001, the rise in patriotism in
  this great republic.&nbsp; The merchandiser including many giant corporations
  in America is trying their best to capitalize on this overt patriotism.&nbsp;
  They are not realizing, however, that all these displays of patriotic
  merchandise on the shelves of their stores may sway the opinion poll vis-à-vis
  the countries that may have harbor the terrorists who hijacked the four
  commercial jetliners and who finally had rammed these planes to demolish the
  Twin Towers located in the Southern part Manhattan. We should be mindful of
  the danger associated with overt patriotism, which many thinkers and
  philosophers have scorned through their writings.&nbsp; Instead of making the
  world of ours a dangerous place to live, the US being the leader of the free
  world should downplay the role of a handful of al-Qaeda over zealots whose
  world had gone awry.&nbsp; Preserving peace in the globe should take
  precedence over patriotism, which Dr. Johnson had described as “the last
  refuse of a scoundrel.”<br>
