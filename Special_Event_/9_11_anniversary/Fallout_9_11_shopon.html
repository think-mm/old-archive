  </font></b><b>
  <p><font size="6" color="#FF0000">A</font></b>merica along with other
  civilized nations all over the world are gearing up to remember the terrible
  incidents of 9-11 that happened a year ago. The destruction of Twin Towers in
  the city where I live is a vivid reminder that the pernicious force of Jihadi
  Islam had again reared its ugly head to create confusion and chaos in America
  and in the West.</p>
  <p>Many wise writers in cyber forums such as NFB had written copiously about
  the ills of Muslim Umma concerning world peace, development, and amity. An
  enduring global peace is essential for humanity to progress and to move
  forward into a courageous but uncertain world. The Muslim world however lagged
  behind in this quest for conscious growth and development for years and years.
  Every which we looked, we saw no democracy to speak about in the Muslim World.</p>
  <p>The leader of Muslim nation is Saudi Arabia, unquestionably. But alas,
  there is no trace of democracy in Saudia. The neighboring Persian Gulf States
  and Kuwait are also not democratic states. In their defense, the government of
  these nations say that democracy and Islam are incompatible. Prof. M. Omar
  Farooq, a regular cyber writer and a Muslim reformer living in the <i>Mashreq </i>(west),
  may disagree with the heads of the states in Arabian peninsula and in Persian
  Gulf region but the fact remains the same.</p>
  <p>According to the dictum of Islam (read Koran and Hadis), there should not
  be any democratic state in any Islamic nation. Maulana Abu Ala Maududi, the
  eminent Islamic scholar of Pakistan wanted to accommodate theocracy in the
  guise of democracy. He called his brand of &quot;democracy&quot; – the
  Theo-democracy. His brainchild, the Jammat, wants to grab power in Bangladesh
  only to convert this docile nation into a hot bed of radicalized Islam. In
  essence, there is no room for democracy in Islam and Prof. Omar Farooq knows
  this for a fact.</p>
  <p>In the post 9-11 days, Muslim clerics all over the world are saying that
  Muslims are one. However, when we look, all we see that Muslims are divided.
  They are divided for good reasons. There is no amity among the Muslim nations.
  In August 1990, Saddam Hussein’s army moved into neighboring Kuwait that
  gave many opportunities to America to apprehend Saddam’s elite Republican
  Army. And guess which nation came forward to help America? It was none other
  than House of Saud who cajoled America to go after Saddam. The reason was very
  clear. If not confronted head-on, Saddam may have annexed Saudi Arabia next.
  Therefore, self-interest had motivated the Saudis to lick the boot of Mr. Bush
  senior.</p>
  <p>Of course, that made a dissident Saudi maverick by the name Osama bin Laden
  very upset. This bootlicking by the Saudis had irked Osama bin Laden so much
  so that years later he gave fatwa against America. Mr. bin Laden is known to
  be an Islamic man of vision. To fulfill his dream, he reared a group of
  trusted men. His brainchild, al-Qaeda, is now being dreaded as a pernicious
  force by America. Mr. George W. Bush, the senior Bush’s son, had promised to
  bring down al-Qaeda and its leaders to their knees. Thus, right now, America
  is fighting an unannounced war against Osama’s army of al-Qaeda while other
  Islamic nation such as Pakistan is helping America to weed out fundamentalist
  Muslims from the face of this world.</p>
  <p>The petite nation of Bangladesh, a Muslim majority nation, is now seeking
  help from America to retrain the Imams whose voice carries a long distance in
  this poverty-mired nation. The other day, the lady Ambassador of America for
  Bangladesh, Ms. Mary Ann Peters, talked to Imams of Bangladesh after they
  finished one such training session, which is most likely paid by the American
  government.</p>
  <p>This re-training of Mullahs is deemed necessary by America because the
  first training the clerics had received in village madrassahs is not
  compatible with the world we all live in. To soften the edge of Jihadi brand
  of Islam, America has targeted tens of thousands of Imams of Bangladesh to
  brainwash them so that their rhetoric on Jumma prayer would be kinder,
  gentler, and friendlier to western nations. This is an innovative way to
  combat the growth of Islamic fundamentalism. We shall have to wait to see the
  results.</p>
  <p>The Talibans of Afghanistan were a formidable force before 9-11. Since they
  harbored anything like Osama bin Laden, America decided to teach them a harsh
  lesson of lifetime. The destructive force of Daisy Cutter Bomb proved to be no
  match for Talibans’ wild and pungent rhetoric.</p>
  <p>Americans thus defeated one orthodox brand of Islam, Talibanism, in an
  unannounced war that barely lasted only two months. America’s superior
  firepower seems to be burdensome and punishing for the uneducated Talibans.
  They gave up their power too easily and moved to neighboring Islamic nation of
  Pakistan for a sanctuary. Pakistan’s Pashto speaking Pathans are not the
  same as Sindhis or Punjabis. Their alliance had always been with the Pashtu
  speaking Afghanis. Therefore, Mullah Omar and his roving gang of lieutenants
  received a warm welcome in the border area in the Northwest Frontier province.</p>
  <p>I am bringing the above information to point out that Muslims all over the
  world are not united as far as 9-11 incidents are concerned. The educated and
  well-off Muslims who are modernists are sympathetic to the West. On the other
  hand, the poor Muslims are on the side of an amalgamation of Muslims composed
  of Osama bin Laden, Talibans, fundamentalists, and other oppressed Muslims
  such as Palestinians.</p>
  <p>Even though Saddam Hussein is not an Islamist by any figment of
  imagination, but lately, he also had invoked Islam to strengthened his
  position amongst Iraqis. Allow me to remind my readers that Pakistan in 1971
  also invoked Islam to protect a united Pakistan from fragmentation. Religion
  had been used as a tool in our part of the world. The Talibans have used it
  too to control the entire provinces of Afghanistan.</p>
  <p>By reading American newspapers in the pre-anniversary days of 9-11, I see
  that many moderate Muslims in America are saying unabashedly that Jihadi brand
  of Islam is not the true face of Islam. Their remarks are geared to garner
  sympathy from Americans. In their heart, though, they know it too well that
  Jihad is an integral part of Islam.</p>
  <p>The 9-11 incidents have pushed the expatriate Muslims into state of
  confusion in the West. Like a litmus test we are asked – as a Muslim, do you
  believe in Jihad and democracy? What should be our response? Yes and No. We
  will be in serious trouble then. So, to make a compromise we unabashedly
  say—Jihad - No, and Democracy - Yes. In our mind, we very well know that we
  are fibbing. For survival in the West, however, we should be allowed to fib.
  Allah being the merciful and beneficent will forgive us for our minor
  transgression. That is what I am hoping.</p>
