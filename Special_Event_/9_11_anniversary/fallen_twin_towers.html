<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="5" color="#000080"><b>The
fallen Twin Towers</b></font></p>
<p><center><font size="+2" color="#993366" face="Comic Sans MS">By A.H. Jaffor
Ullah</font></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The fallen Twin Towers stopped gracing the skyline
of Manhattan from the time the vile gang of bin Laden-financed terrorists
belonging to al-Qaeda brought down the building on September 11, 2001.&nbsp;
What a shame!&nbsp; The planes that were hijacked only minutes before the
cataclysmic event that would convert the graceful building into a heap of
rubbles were commandeered by terrorists such as Mohammad Ata and his accomplice
who were disgruntled young Arabs.&nbsp; One glue that bound them tight was their
hate for America.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever since the World Trade Center was built
starting from late sixties and ending in early seventies, the skyline of
Manhattan had one permanent landmark.&nbsp; And that is the Twin Towers.&nbsp;
It was not an architectural marvel by a long shot.&nbsp; Many New Yorkers who
detest the mundaneness of any boxy-looking building abhorred the look of this
modern office building complex.&nbsp; They used to call it the “Ugly Thing,”
which one could see very clearly from Brooklyn, Staten island, and even from the
shore of New Jersey on a clear day.&nbsp; The building’s view is all but
obliterated from the northern part of Manhattan and from Bronx.&nbsp; From
Queens, one could barely see the top of this building.&nbsp; Many other
skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building, The Chrysler Building, the United
Nations Headquarters Building, and myriad other office building in Mid Town
Manhattan would put a road block to the eyes of any person living in Queens
desiring to see this engineering marvel of the late twentieth century.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">This prodigious building, nevertheless, was a very
much familiar building not only to New Yorkers but also to people all over the
world.&nbsp; Before the Twin Tower complex was erected, the tallest building in
Manhattan Island used to be the 102-storied Empire State Building, which was
erected in 1931.&nbsp;&nbsp; The World Trade Center that housed the Twin Towers
is a complex of six buildings around a central plaza in New York City. The World
Trade Center (WTC) stands at the southwestern tip of Manhattan, near the shore
of the Hudson River and a stone throw distance from Wall Street, the financial
nerve center of America.&nbsp; The complex was built by the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey as a central facility for businesses and government
agencies involved in international trade. The building site is notable for its
huge twin towers, each of which has 110 stories and is 1,350 feet (411 m) tall.&nbsp;
The complex was designed by Minoru Yamasaki and completed in 1970.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The towers of the WTC complex were the world's tallest buildings until surpassed
in 1973 by the Sears Tower in Chicago.&nbsp; Each tower had 104 passenger
elevators, 21,800 windows, and roughly an acre (0.4 hectare) of rentable space
per floor.&nbsp; An observation deck is situated on the 107th floor of the north
tower (2 World Trade Center).&nbsp; Many tourists used to take an elevator ride
to go all the way up to the 107th floor’s observation deck for a breath-taking
view of greater NYC area on a cloudless day.&nbsp; My family members did just
that in 1999 approximately two years before the building would collapse because
of terrorist attack using two hijacked passenger jetliners that were filled to
the capacity with fuel for long flight from east coast to west coast, a journey
of about 3,000 miles.&nbsp; This is not the first time that the Arab terrorists
tried to bring down this office complex.&nbsp;&nbsp; A massive bomb planted by
the followers of a blind Muslim cleric from Egypt exploded in the underground
garage of World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, killing several innocent persons.&nbsp;
The Arab terrorists belonging to a hard core of fundamentalist organization
based somewhere in the heartland of Muslim world and financed supposedly by
Osama bin Laden and his despicable organization al-Qaeda tried again to take
down the Twin Towers, which they think is the icon of America’s great success
as a super power in the twentieth century.&nbsp; Thus, in the morning hours of
September 11, 2001, four groups of Arab terrorists hijacked and commandeered
four passenger jetliners that were bound for long distance air travel.&nbsp; Two
of those planes took off Boston’s Logan International Airport shortly after
the crack of the dawn.&nbsp; The hijackers then commandeered those planes and
they diverted the flight path coming straight to New York City’s Manhattan
Island.&nbsp; Each of those jetliners hit one tower in an interval of less than
an hour.&nbsp; Thus, it was very clear from the beginning that it was no
accident.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">President G.W. Bush gave a hastily arranged press
briefing hours after the terrorist attacks in New York City and in the suburb of
Washington DC.&nbsp; He said in no ambiguous term that the terrorists
responsible for these hijackings would be hunted down and brought to America no
matter where they live for justice.&nbsp; We know what did happen to Taliban
regime who gave a safe haven to Osama bin laden who is thought of the mastermind
behind the attack.&nbsp; American soldiers invaded Afghanistan’s air space in
the months of October through December in 2001 and bombed the Taliban
strongholds with their devastating firepower such as the ‘Daisy Cutter
Bomb.’&nbsp; The Taliban leadership was decimated and most of the surviving
one moved to Pakistan and neighboring Iran for the fear of losing their life.&nbsp;
The intent of this article is not to do an extensive exegesis of what did happen
to Afghanistan and al-Qaeda soldiers in the aftermath of September 11 terrorist
attacks. I simply had to mention the political fallout that resulted from the
collapse of Twin Tower that was caused by the action of a handful of al-Qaeda
operatives.&nbsp; The real loser though, in the entire episode, is the Saudi
Government.&nbsp; Perhaps in a separate essay I will discuss that in detail.</font>

This July 1999 photo shows the WTC Plaza.&nbsp; One of the two towers is visible
in the photo</font></center></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As I mentioned earlier, there used to be six
separate buildings in the WTC complex.&nbsp; Even though the two towers were
physically damaged by the ramming of two jetliners that acted as a flying bomb
(with tens of thousands of aviation fuel), the other four buildings were
extensively damaged by the falling debris and from the impact of the collapse of
the massive two towers.&nbsp; The fire at WTC site raged for months.&nbsp; It
was a horrendous job to put the fire out and to remove all the debris from the
site.&nbsp; It also became a nightmare for the demolishing crew to remove the
last vestiges of what used to be WTC complex.&nbsp; The foundation of the WTC
went down closer to 100 feet or more.&nbsp; Bit by bit and piece by piece
everything had to be removed.&nbsp; And it was done.&nbsp; Now a battle is
raging over the issue of what to do with this valuable few acres of land in the
heart of the financial district of New York City.&nbsp; One group of influential
New Yorkers thinks that the place should be left empty perhaps with a park and a
monument to tell the world what did happen on September 11, 2001.&nbsp; On the
other hand, there is this group of business-minded New Yorkers who are proposing
that the port authority of New York should build yet another office complex with
four medium-sized towers.&nbsp; Only time could tell who will win this tug of
war.&nbsp; Since this is the only place in America where over 2,000 people
perished due solely to terrorist attack, many sensible people think that the
erection of an office complex on this site would be a smack on the face of
people who lost their dear ones on that fateful day.&nbsp; Then again, America
is the land of mercantile enterprises and an emblem of world’s financial
powerhouse.&nbsp; Perhaps what might happen is that a portion of the valuable
land will house a monument in remembrance of the victims of 9-11 terrorist
attacks and the rest of the land will house a brand new office complex.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Few months ago, I listened to a National Public
Radio (NPR) program in which New Yorkers were reminiscing the erection of the
WTC complex.&nbsp; From that program I learned that many Mohawk Indians who now
live in the extreme northern part of the state of New York came down in the late
1960s to Manhattan to work as metal worker while the construction of the WTC
complex was going on in full swing.&nbsp; The Mohawk Indians have no fear for
height.&nbsp; Some of the young workers are now in their fifties.&nbsp; They
certainly have the full recollection of their work.&nbsp; Would it surprise
anyone that many construction workers had fallen to their death while working at
the dizzying heights.&nbsp; The NPR program also interviewed quite a few women
who worked as a guide as a young girl once the building was about to be
completed.&nbsp; Since the WTC complex was considered to be an engineering
marvel of the time, many tourists visiting the New York City were willing to
take a tour of the construction site.&nbsp; The girls who guided those tours are
now in their late forties and early fifties.&nbsp; It was delightful to hear
their stories.&nbsp; As a young person I also visited the 80th floor of one of
those two towers in mid 1970s.&nbsp; I never thought in my life that this office
complex would come tumbling down in my lifetime.&nbsp; It is often said that
truth could be stranger than fiction.</font>

second tower is visible on the back (This photo was taken on July 14, 1999).&nbsp;</font></center>
<center>&nbsp;</center> </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The loss of the familiar Twin Towers
from the urban landscape of Manhattan could be disheartening for people of my
generation.&nbsp; Many immigrants like me who came to America in late 1960s and
early 1970s when the building was about to be completed can relate to the
inauguration of this great building and its awesome sight.&nbsp; The towers also
symbolize the financial success of American mercantilism.&nbsp; The Port Trust
Authorities of New York and New Jersey had calculated it right when they figured
out that if they could construct a building complex for business, then it could
augment the business activities for the entire region.&nbsp; They appropriately
dubbed the building The World Trade Center.&nbsp; Ever since then, the twin
towers of the WTC complex have become the envy of not only other U.S. cities but
also of many other nations on earth.&nbsp; A view of Manhattan’s skyscrapers
from the Liberty Island or the Ellis Island, which my family members and I did
in July 1998, would not be completed with the majestic towers of the WTC
complex.&nbsp; But now, those two famous towers are all but gone.&nbsp; And it
is only because a vile bunch had decided to demolish these towers for those had
already become the icons of America’s supremacy and financial strength.&nbsp;
America due to her economic boom of the last century and her ascendancy to world
power had made many enemies all over the world.&nbsp; One such disgruntled group
aided by Osama bin Laden had drawn up a plan to break the building into
smithereens.&nbsp; And they did it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now the Americans have to face the harsh reality
that the Twin Towers and four other buildings that constitute the WTC complex as
we knew them are gone for ever. The world that we live in has grown up to be a
dangerous place.&nbsp; How to fight terrorism so that the world of ours could
become a placid place should concern us all.&nbsp; Rather than waging an all out
war on Iraq, America should pause for a moment and ask this question: Why is it
that this world of ours has become a hostile place to live?&nbsp; There lays the
answer(s) for a sustainable world sans violence and terrorism.</font><br>
