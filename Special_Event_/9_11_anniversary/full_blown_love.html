  no mistake about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a
  real life story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A colleague of
  mine conveyed the story to me right after 9-11 terrorist attack had happened
  in America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In those days, our
  chitchat used to be mostly centered on 9-11 incidents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>How many had died in the collapse of twin towers, were there any
  survivors buried deep in the rubbles of falling building, were there any
  survivors in the demolished Pentagon Building etc., used to dominate our

  day, my colleague narrated to me an amazing story concerning the love affair
  between two young people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this
  day of ‘Sex and the City,’ it will be naïve of me to think the other way
  around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing amazing
  about a boy meeting a girl and happening to fell in love head over hills with
  her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the disconcerting
  part of the story was how did 9-11 incident come to play a decisive role in
  the story in which two lovers were about to be conjoined in a marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The 9-11 incident wreaked havoc amongst many people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Some were hit directly, while others were impacted indirectly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m sure the story, which I am about to narrate, is not a
  unique one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps many other
  lovebirds also had faced the same trial and tribulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  elderly gentleman and his wife who are Americans are leading a retired life in
  one of the suburbs of New Orleans.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  of his adult life in New Orleans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  semi-tropical warm weather of this southern city has its charm on many folks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The retired American couple thus had decided to live in New Orleans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The grown up boys of the couple lives elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>One of their sons lives in Maine in the eastern seaboard 1600 miles
  away from New Orleans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The story
  revolves around the grandson of the retired New Orleanian couple who also
  lives in Maine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This young man is
  our hero.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why not let us call him
  our Romeo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our Juliet is not a
  full-blooded American blonde or anything of that sort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Believe it or not, she is a Bangladeshi expatriate young woman who is
  very charming and attending the Wellesley College in neighboring
  Massachusetts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our Juliet’s
  parents also live in the same town in Maine where Romeo’s parents live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">Our
  Romeo has just finished his bachelor degree in Math and Computer Science from
  Bates College, a private name brand College located at Lewiston, Maine in May
  2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The grandparents of Romeo,
  our retired New Orleanian couple, had flown all the way to Maine to see his
  son and then to accompany them to Lewiston to attend the graduation ceremony
  of their grandson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There, they
  met for the first time a Bangladeshi beauty, our permanently tanned Juliet and
  her parents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It turns out that
  these two young persons are terribly in love with one other and that is not
  all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They had made plans to marry
  very soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of these were news
  to the grandparents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
  liberal enough to say that they have their blessings in this forthcoming
  marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After the graduation
  ceremony was over, the parents and the grandparents of the Romeo were invited
  to a tea party at the house of the fiancée of the young man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The grandparents loved the idea very much.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Since these two families will be united anyway not too
  further down the road, this informal chitchatting and get-together was a good
  gesture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Bangladeshi family
  of our Juliet was very hospitable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone
  seems to have enjoyed this little extemporaneously arranged get-together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The Romeo’s father had known the family of our Juliet over the years
  because both the families live in the same town and our Romeo and Juliet have
  known each other from their high school days. <o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">Everything
  was all set to go for a winter wedding. But then, the terrible incident of
  November 11 happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately
  after the demolition of Twin Towers and a portion of the Pentagon Building
  news were hitting the airwaves that these were the works of Muslim terrorists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>When this information came out, the parents and the grandparents of the
  Romeo were alarmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even though
  they have given their consent to this forthcoming wedding of their loving son
  and grandson, this ominous news story of Muslims terrorists wreaking havoc in
  America really shook the resolve of this sweet American family.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There were some nervous telephone calls from Louisiana to
  Maine back and forth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What should
  they do?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How are they going to
  tell their relatives that this Bangladeshi girl even though she has Muslim
  heritage has nothing to do with terrorism?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>There were some anxious moments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  Romeo was in a fix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His parents
  were pressing him hard for more information on the background of the
  Bangladeshi family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can’t
  even imagine how our Juliet had taken this entire ordeal!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">Here
  in New Orleans, the retired couple, the grandfather of the Romeo, asks
  nervously my colleague, “Are Bangladeshi people fanatic Muslims?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>My colleague knew me for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Thus he knows that Bangladesh has many liberal families.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>He told them not to worry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
  also assured them that the family must be a liberal one or else they would not
  be willing to let their daughter marry a Christian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>That sounds like a good pointer to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The grandparents also understood the underlying strength of such logic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A few eventless days went by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
  came the good news from Maine.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">One
  afternoon, the retired couple came over to my colleague’s house and knocked
  at their door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their happy
  disposition meant that they brought some darn good news to tell my colleague.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It turns out that the Bangladeshi family in Maine is a half-Muslim and
  half-Buddhist one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The father was
  born in a Muslim family but the mother came from a Buddhist family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Therefore, there were no reasons to be concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The old couple heaved a great sigh of relief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The wedding plan remained intact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A would be everlasting love was saved at long last.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">When
  my colleague told me about this unfolding story of our Juliet’s religious
  identity, I knew then that her mother must be from Chittagong or Chittagong
  Hill Tract area because most Buddhists in Bangladesh are from that region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The other assumption is that Juliet’s own mother and father may have
  fallen in love before they were married.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In our part of the world when two lovers from separate religions fell
  in love and they want to tie a knot, the society do not condone such
  inter-religious marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Our Juliet’s unique background has helped her in the first
  place to fell in love head over heels with the Romeo.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>An archconservative Muslim family would fight tooth and nail
  not to allow their daughter dating anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Marry a Christian
  would not be in the cards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
  we all know darn well.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="3">From
  the above story we could imagine how strenuous of a task it was for Juliet to
  endure the probing of her fiancée into her private life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Also, we saw how nervous the New Orleanian grandparents became when
  they first heard the news that our Juliet may be a Muslim because her parents
  were from Bangladesh, a Muslim majority nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This question of whether our Juliet in the story is a Muslim woman or
  not would not be raised had there been no 9-11 incident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Our story had a happy ending, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But imagine what could have been the case if it turned out that
  Juliet’s parents were both devout Muslims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Well, some may argue that girls from a <i>pucca</i> Muslim family
  won’t behave like our story’s Juliet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But as you know, love makes people blind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
