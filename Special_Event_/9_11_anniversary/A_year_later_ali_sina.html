  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A year ago, on Sep 11, a group of Muslims killed
  thousands of civilians in the name of their god and for one reason alone: They
  were “non-believers”. Since then Muslim apologists as well as our
  politically supper correct politicians kept rehashing “</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b>Islam
  is a religion of peace</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">”
  ad nauseam. Anyone who believes that is a witling simpleton.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A few days ago, in an article of the online magazine Al-Ansar,
  which is affiliated with Al-Qa'ida, a columnist identified as Seif Al-Din Al-Ansari
  discussed the Ouranic verse &quot;Allah Will Torture Them [the Infidels] At <b><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">Your</span></i></b><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">

  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The article is entitled “<b>The Annihilation of the
  Infidels is a Divine Decree</b>”.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">He writes:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 9pt"><br>
  &quot;</span></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#000080"><b>Regardless
  of the norms of 'humanist' belief, which sees destroying the infidel countries
  as a tragedy requiring us to show some conscientious empathy and... an
  atmosphere of sadness for the loss that is to be caused to human civilization
  - an approach that does not distinguish between believer and infidel... - I
  would like to stress that annihilating the infidels is an inarguable fact, as
  this is the [divine] decree of fate...</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;When the Koran places these tortures [to be
  inflicted on the infidels] in the solid framework of reward and punishment...
  it seeks to root this predestined fact in the consciousness of the Muslim
  group, asserting that the infidels will be annihilated, so as to open a window
  of hope to the Muslim group...&quot;&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The writer urges: “<b><span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">Muslims
  must not wait passively for the Divine Decree to just happen… </span></b><span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">but
  to do their religious duty and inflict torture upon the infidels.<b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span></b></span><b><span style="COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">He carries on:
  &quot;When Allah told us of the certainty of the annihilation of the infidels,
  He did not do so using ambiguous concepts. He clarified that this would be
  achieved in one of two ways: by means of a direct act of Allah... or by means
  of the Muslim group, which would, in accordance with the Islamic commandment,
  serve as an implement for carrying out [the divine decree], as it is said:
  '...Allah will torture them [the infidels] Himself or at our hands (Koran
  9:52).'&quot; &nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">&quot;This is
  merely a belief, which, if unaccompanied by the words 'at your hands' that
  appear in the Koranic verse [9:14, 'Fight them and Allah will torture them at
  your hands'] - it will remain in the wonderful realm of ideas that float in
  the theoretical universe, and is like beautiful dreams that arouse
  conscientious emotions - yet, when we awake, we find that the infidel country
  still exists, falsehood is not destroyed [by itself] in favor of the truth,
  [except when] the truth goes into action...&quot;&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">The writer
  continues <b>&quot;By Means of Jihad - Allah Tortures [the Infidels] with
  Killing&quot;</b> &quot;The question now on the agenda is, how is the torture
  Allah wants done at our hands to be carried out?... This torture will not, in
  any way, be carried out by means of preaching <i>[Da'wa]</i>, because
  preaching is activity of exposure, aimed at clarifying the truth in a way that
  makes it more easily acceptable. Preaching has nothing to do with torture;
  Jihad is the way of torturing [the infidels] at our hands.&quot; &nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">In Britain
  another Muslim group called al-Muhajiroun, is planning to hold a conference
  &quot;celebrating&quot; September 11 highlighting &quot;the positive
  outcomes&quot; of last year's attacks. The title of the conference: &quot;<b>A
  Towering Day in History</b>&quot;. &nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">Many Muslims are
  convinced that 9/11 tragedy was a great thing because it heightened the public
  interest in Islam. And surely there were fools such as the British tabloid
  journalist Yvonne Ridley who converts to Islam and validated this belief. This
  means that we should brace ourselves for more terrorist attacks because in the
  twisted minds of the Islamists the 9/11 </span>carnage was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">a
  positive thing.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">May be Yvonne
  Ridley, who already passed her primes is a lonesome soul in need of affection.
  Muslims are good in fulfilling this need by showering the new converts with
  care and making her feel the queen of the universe. But unknowingly these
  foolhardy converts encourage the rise of Islamic terrorism. In </span>August
  26, 2000 Springar Journal published an articled by Barry Bearak called<b>
  Behind the Veil, a Muslim Feminist</b>. This was the story of a young Malayan
  girl raised in an educated middle class family of doctors who became an
  Islamic terrorist after reading a book describing the conversion of the
  Western women to Islam. When westerners convert to Islam, the Muslims are
  confirmed that their religion is a true religion and they go practicing it,
  which of course means terrorism. Read this story <a href="http://main.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina/feedfundamentalism.htm">here</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">Of course 9/11
  was a positive thing. Not only Yvonne Ridley converted to Islam, and the
  President Bush and Tony Blair declared Islam to be a religion of peace, also </span>the
  University of North Carolina decided to use the taxpayers’ money to teach
  their freshmen<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“The Early
  Revelations” of the Quran. Why the early revelation and not the whole thing?
  Because the early revelation was written in Mecca when Muhammad was still weak
  with few followers and like Jesus used to preach only good things. All the
  violent and bloody verses of the Quran are contained in the later revelations
  that were written in Medina when Muhammad became powerful. It was then that he
  launched his Jihads and went on his killing sprees to loot and promote the
  “true” religion of Allah by killing the infidels.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">Meanwhile the </span>Council
  on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) is planning to launch a national
  initiative to “educate” the American public about Islam and to counter
  “anti-Muslim bigotry”.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">What are they talking about? The media, the press, and
  the politicians even some church clerics have declared unanimously “Islam is
  a religion of peace”, so why the CAIR is so concerned? They are concerned
  because the pubic did not buy that bull. “You cannot fool all the people all
  the time”, said Abraham Lincoln. Muslims’ actions speak louder than their
  apologetic words and despite all the attempts to deceive the public, a handful
  of not so politically correct Internet sites are attracting huge traffics
  because they are not politically correct and that is making the CAIR very
  nervous.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">On one hand we have the Islamists who are trying to
  implement the mandates of their 7<sup>th</sup> century messenger of death and
  are planning to kill you, on the other hand we have the media and western
  politicians who keep sedating the public opinion with pure lies that Islam
  means peace. And now we have the CAIR launching a yearlong campaign, called
  &quot;Explore Islamic Civilization and Culture,&quot; to “counter
  anti-Muslim bigotry”.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Islamic Civilization? What an oxymoron! Since when
  barbarity is called civilization? Islam is an anti civilization cult par
  excellence. It destroyed every civilization that it touched. It brought
  misery, poverty, ignorance and war in every country that it invaded. &nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I wonder when the world is going to wake up and respond
  to MUSLIM BIGOTRY! Isn’t it time that we stopped this pee cee game and start
  looking at the harsh reality that the problem with Islamic terrorism is Islam
  itself? Is the mainstream media going to continue hiding its head in the sand
  until another catastrophe hit? It seems that the west is determined to deceive
  itself? Why? The truth is simple. <b>Islamic terrorism is motivated by the
  teachings of the Quran. Read the Quran and you will see it for yourself where
  the terrorists get their inspiration. Islam is not a religion of peace.</b> <b><u>You
  cannot eliminate terrorism unless you eliminate the ideology behind it.</u></b>
  It is time that we focus on the cause and not the symptom. It is time that Mr.
  Bush stop beating around the bushes, stop calling Islam a religion of peace
  and start calling a spade a spade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
