	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">December,1994, a damn cold winter. 
	Outer world seemed so faded in the last sunshine through the window. It made 
	a different corner in the hall room with the scientific maps, charts &amp; 
	photographs of evolution and planets, stars...all round. In the hall room, 
	almost 44/45 people age ranging from 16 to 75 were concentrating on my 
	lecture about ‘Cosmic Calendar’. There was a grand photograph of Milky Way 
	Galaxy in the background. The galaxy we live in, even light takes one 
	hundred thousands years to travel through end to end of the milky way. As I 
	was talking about cosmic calendar, by and by it went through Big Bang, 
	Origin of life, Evolution &amp; of course civilization. At the end of 
	discussion, the audience questioned a lot. They were curious like the 
	children. It was such an environment they could ask anything about the dawn 
	and the end of the civilization, birth &amp; death of the stars. Some of their 
	questions were really remarkable. Specially, I was amazed at one question. 
	One of the audience asked if the age of civilization could be shown based on 
	Geological Time Scale. Though the descent of human is an early event in 
	comparison with the creation of the earth &amp; lives of the stars. Anyway the 
	audience were not requested to come and listen to the lecture. In fact, 
	everyone willingly paid forty taka to participate the scientific discussion, 
	most probably for the first time in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the discussion when I walked 
	on the street it was almost night. Shivering cold night. I observed a 
	glimpse of some excitements of people &amp; hard talking in front of the shops. 
	They were discussing curiously about evolution of life, spiral stages of 
	evolution between the apes &amp; the man, origin of the life from inanimate 
	substances. It was the first experience of open discussion by ‘Discussion 
	Project’--the organization that was successfully arranging discussions on 
	science &amp; civilization for the last six years on ticket basis. For a while, 
	I was lost in fantasy that this was the night of inquisitive young minds of 
	different parts of science in Göttingen University or it was the Athens on 
	the bank of the Mediterranean sea where the great Socrates asked the people 
	about anything to do with life &amp; thus entering the root of knowledge. 
	Alternatively, long before as the ‘Ionian passion’ by the eastern Aegean sea 
	arose, the endless curiosity about all events of nature began. The Ionian 
	questioned and made the confirming observations for truth that we call 
	‘scientific method’. They were the sons of the sailors, farmers and weavers.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I started ‘Discussion Project’ with 
	two participants only in 1992, and the date was19th of May. Payment for 
	participation was taken as it made them more serious and expenditure to 
	organize the discussion would be minimized. Otherwise, it would be taken as 
	simply spending time of leisure and its importance would be less. And 
	economical involvement made it more professional &amp; obviously the whole thing 
	as ‘work’. As far as we know, we first initiated such professional lectures 
	in Bangladesh. It was June, 1993, in the last shines of the day, we started 
	with only eight people in the audience, and the first Group Discussion was 
	about ‘Extraterrestrial Civilization’. The place was so ordinary. However, 
	it was an extraordinary excitement in the dreamy eyes of participants, 
	though they were miserable members of a third world poorest country, they 
	were showing their interest professionally about extraterrestrial life! We 
	tried to think as the great people did. My small room was full of four 
	thousand books, science and civilization based maps, charts, documentary 
	film of V.D.O cassettes, and all this turned the domestic, ordinary 
	environment into a place beyond earth. Everyone was excited about the 
	expedition of Champollion for mysterious Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions. 
	Because ancient Egyptians were like the aliens to us for two thousand years, 
	although they lived in same planet earth. Champollion spent fifteen years 
	about ancient Egyptian mystery. One of the eight who paid fifty taka for 
	participation in the lecture, asked about the schedule for next lecture. I 
	was certainly amused at their interest. After the discussion in the night 
	when I stood by the river in gentle breeze looking at the quiet tide, I 
	thought that a great work was done. Everything appeared so much like a 
	series of wonderful dreams. I was thinking about ‘scientific 
	civilization’--such a civilization where knowledge and its integrity would 
	be most important. Only then it would be possible to measure the age of 
	civilization based on Geological Time Scale. I was deeply influenced by Carl 
	Sagan’s words about the scientific civilization. Sometimes I thought it was 
	the same to talk about Carl Sagan’s works or to express my views. For this 
	reason I lectured on Carl Sagan’s works and thinking in some discussions and 
	people eagerly listened. Then I felt to write a book about Carl Sagan’s 
	works and thinking about science &amp; civilization, and thus communicating to 
	the mass people. So people would be interested to read the scripture of Carl 
	Sagan and know the facts needed to stand against the evils of civilization 
	and for long lasting scientific civilization! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then in 1996, on the 4th of October 
	a miracle happened --all tickets of the 13th open discussion on ‘Search for 
	the Second Earth’ were finished half an hour before the programme. It was 
	really inspiring and astonishing. Even people were standing outside to 
	listen to the lecture. Almost one hundred and fifty people paid for that 
	lecture. As a matter of fact this was a remarkable event in the history of 
	not only Discussion project but in the perspective of Bangladesh. It is very 
	rare in any field of art-culture programme of Bangladesh, moreover, that 
	event was ‘scientific discussion’. Now there is an evil train of competition 
	in the whole world to cross each other anyway and to make a good score in 
	examinations. Only higher marks and certificates confirming the success in 
	life. After all, the people came to listen to lecture without any current 
	benefits. But they came spontaneously to acquire classical knowledge or in 
	search of self belief. I think this was a grand success in this ‘give and 
	take policy world’. All these things made me dreamer of a cosmic 
	civilization---without R-complex, the evil result of evolution of human 
	brain. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The people came to the lecture were 
	students, teachers, doctors, engineers, businessmen, clerks---so many 
	different classes of people. All ordinary members of society. They arrived 
	in the discussion meetings paying fifty taka each ignoring the distress of 
	floods, rains, storms and they asked great questions: why cultural evolution 
	was faster than organic evolution? Is the human being going towards further 
	evolution? As a radioactive substance decays to its half after a certain 
	period, then what will happen to its single atom (where the atom is unity of 
	matter)? What was before Big Bang? Why time stops in the blackhole? What is 
	the quantum theory? What would be the communicating language between two 
	different intelligent planeteers and so on. All these questions roused my 
	sense of wonder and my discussions are real evidences that people can ask a 
	great deal if they get a little opportunity. Thus I finished totally two 
	hundred and fifty lectures including individual, open &amp; group discussion 
	where thousands of people participated and listened carefully. So I started 
	to write about Carl Sagan’s works and thinking of science and civilization.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sometimes while walking through the 
	streets, banks of the rivers, restaurants, markets, I was asked that what 
	would be the ultimate benefit of knowledge. In fact, we have to culture 
	knowledge for our existence, no substitute remains. We can walk through the 
	roads safely---this is the result of knowledge. We have overcome the evil 
	sprit of R-complex by virtue of knowledge. We have made some basic rules of 
	morality as not to attack anyone unnecessarily, or not to snatch anyone’s 
	material. Thus avoiding the destructive tendency, we are trying to develop 
	love, affection and humanity. These are all needed to fight against 
	self-destructive conditions and for longing the existence of civilization. 
	Someone said to me that people don’t live long and their needs are 
	limited--so why should we run after culturing knowledge? I failed to make 
	him understand. After someday when his brother was attacked by liver 
	cirrhosis &amp; waiting for death. He was trying to take the patient to Madras 
	as last resort, then I succeeded to give the message---why knowledge is 
	needed. Due to lack of knowledge (ignorance and illiteracy) our people can’t 
	expect least help in their distress from our doctors (obviously there are 
	some exceptions). In our country most physicians are only money earning 
	machines and heartless. In all sectors of education result is alike. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How far we should know and shouldn’t 
	know--this cannot be the destiny of knowledge. In case of study this sort of 
	limited thinking can stop the development of knowledge. Because there are 
	lot of evidences that everyone cultured knowledge due to their emptiness of 
	minds. But ultimately people and society benefitted from their knowledge. 
	Once Euclid while lecturing on geometry, a student after his first class 
	asked what would be the benefit of learning geometry. Then Euclid ordered 
	his slave to give that student a coin as he always wanted benefits from what 
	he learnt. There are so many people nowadays who wants the immediate 
	benefits from knowledge. If this class of people succeed then the 
	development of knowledge will be stopped. This worst tendency has developed 
	extremely. We have become a score or mark based nation in education. Our 
	school, colleges are aspiring to this. So the train of gaining knowledge is 
	almost dead. Once the Queen Victoria asked Michael Faraday about his 
	discovery of ‘electromagnetic induction’ that what was its use. Then he 
	answered that ‘what is the use of new born baby’. Now after 150 years we 
	know the role of electricity, we can’t think of anything without 
	electricity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Regarding my work so many people 
	asked me, what is my destiny? At first we have to fix the target because 
	what is the benefit of general people of knowing geometry, cosmos or quantum 
	world? So isn’t it more beneficiary for them to learn about general 
	necessities? I did not answer these questions but felt uneasy and became 
	puzzled that what should be the answer. I asked myself that who am I to 
	define one’s necessity of knowing or how can it be measured. An ordinary 
	man’s life: who is born in this world to eat thrice daily, sleep at night 
	and to give birth to an offspring, only to then die---is there any 
	difference from an animal? Then what is the success of human life? Will he 
	never know, how a star is born, how many stars are in this Universe, what is 
	his status in the universe, how atomic realm can be explained by quantum 
	mechanics, what is space-time curvature, why time becomes slower if move in 
	the velocity of light relative to steady platform? The understanding may not 
	be like a specialized one but if people doesn’t even know the result of 
	scientific phenomenon----they will fail to realize that how little is their 
	existence in this vast arena of universe and age of it. As they cannot 
	realize, so the people have become slave to blind religious spirits beyond 
	logic. So the people are always used by some power hunters and clergymen who 
	destroyed the great Alexandrian Library and all its scientific documents. 
	Thus the ‘Ionian passion’ could not be saved even. If we could do so, we 
	could start for an ‘Interstellar Civilization’. And our first survey ship 
	would return back from Alpha centauri, Bernard’s star, Sirius stars and Tau 
	Ceti long before. The grand interstellar spaceships would travel/plow the 
	cosmic ocean. We would be on the crossroads of ‘Interstellar civilization’.
