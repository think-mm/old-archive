		<p>&nbsp;<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the twentieth 
		century, most countries of the world have passed through the process of 
		land reforms for it has been learnt from historical experience that 
		progress would never be achieved until the old means of production were 
		replaced by new ones. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The USSR is a classic example, 
		not only boosting its agricultural production, but also enhancing its 
		industrial output. For example, the total crop area of the USSR in 1913 
		was 105 million hectares and this increased to 136.9 million hectares in 
		1938. Likewise, industrial growth was boosted from 100 percent in 1913 
		to 908.8 percent in 1938. These startling economic achievements of the 
		USSR were the result of new economic theories. As Joseph Stalin once 
		said, “Theory, if it is genuine theory, gives practical workers the 
		power of orientation, clarity of perspective and confidence in their 
		work, faith in the victory of the cause” (Problems of Leninism by J. 
		Stalin, Pages 612, 609, 301). </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Old economic theories, for 
		example the theory of equilibrium, the theory of spontaneity in 
		socialist construction, and the theory of stability of small peasant 
		farming were replaced by the progressive Marxist theories of expanded 
		reproduction and large-scale socialist farming. State and cooperative 
		farms were established which increased the crop area by 50 percent due 
		to the fact that the peasants were transformed into a mighty force as 
		they pooled their implements and became united in collective farms. 
		Similarly, in Cuba land reform was among the chief directives of the 
		revolutionary wave of 1959. Almost all large holdings were seized by the 
		National Institute for Land Reform (INRA); a ceiling of 166 acres (67 
		hectares) was established, and tenants were given full ownership rights. 
		In Asia, South Korea’s spectacular economic advance and Indian Punjab’s 
		progress were based on land reforms and mass education. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Against this, the data released 
		by the Agricultural Census Organisation of Pakistan revealed that the 
		total farm area in the country in 1972 was 49.21 million acres, and 
		increased by only by 1.29 million acres to 50.50 million acres in 2000. 
		Likewise, the total cultivated area increased by just 0.02 million 
		acres, from 40.75 million acres in 1972 to 40.77 million acres in 2000.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question is why our country, 
		with a population of more than 65 percent in the villages and 
		contributing 25 percent towards the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 
		the agricultural sector, has lagged behind in agro-development. In this 
		article I have tried to answer these questions. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first land reforms were 
		introduced in 1959, when the ceiling for private ownership of land was 
		fixed at 500 acres irrigated and 1,000 acres un-irrigated land. However, 
		this did little to distribute the land of the country’s prosperous rural 
		elite among the poor. It was more a cosmetic exercise than a significant 
		social change. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the problems was that 
		ceilings were fixed in terms of individuals rather than families. The 
		reforms included generous exemptions as well as separate provisions for 
		orchards. Hardly 35 percent of the excess land declared by landowners 
		was actually assumed by the government and the redistribution benefited 
		only eight percent of the subsistence farmers. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in 1972, 
		made a second attempt at land reforms. This time the ownership ceiling 
		was reduced to 150 acres of irrigated and 300 acres of un-irrigated 
		land. The impact was not significant. Less than 0.9 million acres were 
		acquired for redistribution, which was about one-third of the land 
		resumed under the 1959 land reforms. Once again, land ceilings were 
		based on individual holdings. As a result a number of large landowners 
		managed to keep their holdings intact, and gave up only non-productive 
		or swampy land. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1977, the Bhutto government 
		further reduced ceilings on private ownership of farmland to about four 
		hectares of irrigated land and about eight hectares of non-irrigated 
		land. Additionally, agricultural income became taxable, though small 
		farmers owning ten hectares or less were exempted. Then Chairman Federal 
		Land Commission Sheikh Mohammad Rashid (deceased) worked very hard to 
		implement these reforms, but the military regime of Ziaul Haq that 
		ousted Bhutto failed to follow up on them. Governments in the 1980s and 
		early 1990s avoided serious land reforms, because they drew much of 
		their support from landowners. The last three land reforms managed to 
		resume less than eight per cent of privately-owned land in the country, 
		which was distributed amongst less than one per cent of the rural poor.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Land reforms are protected today 
		by Article 23 of the Constitution, which states, “Every citizen shall 
		have the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property in any part of 
		Pakistan, subject to the Constitution and any reasonable restrictions 
		imposed by law in the public interest.” In addition, the Shariat 
		Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court has proclaimed land reforms against 
		the tenets of Islam. Thus all lands acquired by feudals in return for 
		their services rendered to the British Imperial power in 1857 or after 
		until independence, were completely protected from land reforms. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to a UN report, 
		“Comprehensive land reforms are indispensable for any basic change in 
		Pakistan’s political and economic system. Without such reforms, the 
		nation may remain locked in a virtual political and economic paralysis. 
		Periodic elections will bring little change, as many of the same people 
		will be recycled through the legislatures, whatever their party labels 
		or affiliations. Major economic reforms will keep waiting, as the feudal 
		system generally believes in economic patronage rather than in good 
		governance. Any enlightened social changes will be held hostage to the 
		inherent conservatism of a feudal society.” </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such an important issue has been 
		given no importance by the present regime and they even turned a deaf 
		ear towards the advice of the World Bank that land reforms were vital 
		for the development of Pakistan. The political influence of landlords 
		has halted any further land reforms temporarily, but this does not mean 
		that no progress is possible. The process of historic evolution tells us 
		that progress never waits for particular events but gradually evolves 
		with changes in the means of production. But can we wait for the slow 
		process of evolution in this fast-growing world? No, we can’t wait! It 
		is critical that the government acts immediately to implement land 
		reforms in which earlier lacunas are removed. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On January 15, 2005, the federal 
		cabinet rejected the amendment in the progressive clauses of the Land 
		Reforms Act 1977 proposed by the Federal Land Commission (FLC). This 
		indicates we have a reforms-friendly government but this is superficial: 
		the government is still anti-tiller. According to Agricultural 
		Statistics of Pakistan (1999-2000), 13 percent of the farms are below 
		0.5 hectares; 14 percent farms are between 0.5 to 1.0 hectares; 20 
		percent are between 1.0 to under 2.0 hectares; 46 percent farms are 
		between 2.0 to 10.0 hectares; and only seven percent are above 10.0 
		hectares. In terms of area, the last group owns 40 percent of the total 
		area and 27 percent own one per cent of the total farm area. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Balochistan presents a case of 
		the highest level of unequal distribution. People owning 60 hectares and 
		above are two percent and their average size of farms is 155 hectares. 
		Since the land in Balochistan is not as fertile as in Punjab or Sindh, 
		the situation is not so alarming there. In Punjab 37 percent own 10.0 
		hectares and above, and 36 percent in Sindh. This is a pathetic 
		situation as it is hindering the country’s social, economic and 
		political progress. Now it has been accepted even by the government that 
		the increase in poverty is due to poor agriculture policies, as on March 
		21, 2006, a national daily reported that the National Assembly standing 
		committee on food and agriculture held that flawed agriculture policies 
		being pursued by the government have raised poverty levels. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So far as land reforms are 
		concerned, the FLC revealed that only 1.8 million hectares (less than 
		eight percent of arable land in the country) have been earmarked for 
		redistribution so far. The military government has distributed 1.4 
		million hectares to some 288,000 small farmers and other beneficiaries. 
		We have to struggle for more, because land ownership is still highly 
		concentrated. More than half of the country’s total farmland is in farms 
		of 50 acres or more. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is apparent that the 
		implementation of land reforms is impossible, for the class empowered to 
		undertake these reforms comprises big landlords. Its class interests do 
		not allow it to take any revolutionary measures in the farm sector. The 
		obvious solution then, is an uprising of tillers, agriculture workers 
		and tenants with the cooperation of industrial workers. In this way 
		workers will decide their own fate and can take revolutionary measures 
		to develop the farm and other sectors of society. </font></div></td>
