			<h2 align="center"><font color="#800000">Letting science answer the 
			question</font></h2>
			<h2 align="center">&nbsp;</h2>
			<h2 align="center"><font color="#000080">Paul Kurtz </font></h2>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is the relationship 
			between science and religion? The advocates of theistic religion 
			often maintain that religion expresses a mode of truth that is 
			independent of scientific knowledge, and that religious experience 
			presents a form of intuition or knowing that reason cannot 
			comprehend. They claim that there is no conflict between these two 
			domains and that they complement each other. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Can science explain 
			religious behavior in naturalistic terms? Can there be a science of 
			religion? Scientists attempt to account for various forms of human 
			behavior: economic, political, biological, psychological. If we can 
			talk about political science, or economic science, can we also talk 
			about the science of religion? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The answers to this 
			question, I submit, are in the affirmative, at least in principle. 
			Indeed, a great deal of scientific energy has already been expended 
			to account for behavior that is described as “religious.” Historians 
			attempt to describe the historical past of religious institutions; 
			sociologists seek to explain their social structures and functions; 
			anthropologists deal with religions in primitive cultures; 
			psychologists of religion seek to account for “religious 
			experience,” the role of prayer and ritual, in human behavior, etc. 
			There are any number of scholarly and scientific fields that deal 
			with the historical and archaeological contexts in which the sacred 
			texts were written or engage in philological and comparative 
			analyses. The premise of all these studies is that we should treat 
			the varieties of religious behavior as we would any other forms of 
			human behavior; that is, approach them objectively and 
			dispassionately, attempting to understand what is going on without 
			an a priori evaluative bias. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I wish in this article to 
			focus on only one basic question: Why do people believe in religious 
			doctrines, i.e., why do they accept the tenets of a religion and 
			participate in its practices and rituals? Conversely, we may ask, 
			Why do some people disbelieve in the tenets of religion or reject 
			its practices? This has been the topic of an ongoing research 
			project that the Center for Inquiry has undertaken over the years. 
			Free Inquiry was founded two decades ago to open religion to careful 
			critical examination, at a time when it was considered by many to be 
			impolite, perhaps even illegitimate or perverse, to undertake such 
			studies. </font></p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religion’s Power</font></h3>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Three dramatic religious 
			events illustrate the perennial power of religious faith in human 
			culture. The first is the huge annual assembly of Islamic pilgrims 
			drawn to Mecca every year. Photographs of an estimated three million 
			devotees who were in Mecca in recent pilgrimages show that they have 
			come from all walks of life and from all classes. The second 
			impressive annual event are the millions of Hindus in India who 
			congregate at the Ganges River in accordance with ancient religious 
			rituals. At the most recent event, an estimated ten million people 
			appeared at the Kumbha Mela festival in the small city of Hardiwar 
			for prayer and purification. And the third is the re-exhibition at a 
			cathedral in Turin of the shroud that Jesus was allegedly wrapped in 
			and buried. A huge throng of visitors have come from all over the 
			world to view the Shroud of Turin. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Skeptical doubts can surely 
			be raised about the claim that a pilgrimage to Mecca will guarantee 
			Muslim believers entrance to heaven or that bathing in the Ganges 
			River will bestow special spiritual benefits. There is no evidence 
			that the performance of ritualistic acts of spiritual contrition, 
			either by visiting the Kaaba in Mecca and encircling it three times, 
			or by bathing in the water of the Ganges, will achieve a blessed 
			state of Paradise for Muslims or Atman for Hindus. To point out to 
			the devout disciples of these two ancient religions that the 
			recommended rites are contradictory or have no basis in fact 
			generally fall on deaf ears. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly for the Shroud of 
			Turin, which, according to the best available scientific evidence, 
			was a forgery made in Lirey, France, in the fourteenth century. 
			Interestingly, it was condemned as such at that time by the bishop 
			in the area, for it was used to deceive thousands of pilgrims 
			seeking cures for their illnesses. Walter McCrone, the noted 
			microscopist, has shown that the red color on the shroud was not 
			human blood, but red ochre and vermilion tempera paint. Joe Nickell 
			of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the 
			Paranormal has even demonstrated that it is possible to produce a 
			similar image on cloth by a rubbing technique, using the vermilion 
			and ochre pigments that were available at that time in France. 
			Moreover, portions of the shroud were carbon-14 dated by three 
			independent laboratories, all of whom reported that it was not 1,900 
			years old, but probably fabricated approximately 700 years ago. 
			These reports were published in the scientific literature and 
			received widespread attention in the press; and skeptical scientists 
			applauded the forensic evidence, which clearly stated that the image 
			on the shroud was not due to a miracle, but could be given a 
			naturalistic causal explanation. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet, much to the surprise of 
			skeptics, who thought that they had decisively refuted the 
			proponents of the faith, the shroud industry has returned with full 
			force and vigor and is proclaiming that skeptics were in error. 
			Believers maintain that there were alleged flaws in the carbon-14 
			process—all rationalizations in the view of skeptics—and that the 
			shroud was the burial garment of Jesus Christ. </font></p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The History of Religion</font></h3>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why do people believe in the 
			above religious claims? Is it because they have not been exposed to 
			criticisms? Most of the classical religious beliefs emerged in a 
			pre-scientific era before the application of the methods of science. 
			Unfortunately, the origins of the venerated ancient religions are 
			often buried by the sands of historical time—though biblical critics 
			have endeavored to reconstruct the foundations of these religions by 
			using the best scholarly and scientific methods of inquiry. It is 
			often difficult to engage in impartial scholarly or scientific 
			inquiry into the origins of religious doctrines, particularly when 
			those critically examining the foundations of the revered truths are 
			often placed in jeopardy by their societies. Biblical criticism in 
			the Western world has only relatively recently been freed from 
			prohibiting censorship and/or the power of institutional sanctions 
			brought to bear on freethinkers. Koranic criticism is virtually 
			absent in Islamic lands, or if it is done it is only with great fear 
			of retribution; for questioning the divine authority of Muhammad is 
			considered by the Koran itself to be a form of blasphemy punishable 
			by a fatwah. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ancient religions of 
			prophecies and revelations—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—all 
			claim that God intervened at one time in history, spoke to Moses and 
			the prophets, resurrected Jesus, or communicated through Gabriel to 
			Muhammad. Skeptics maintain that the key claims have never been 
			adequately corroborated by reliable independent&nbsp; eyewitnesses. The 
			so-called sacred books no doubt incorporate the best theological and 
			metaphysical yearnings of ancient nomadic and agricultural 
			societies, and they often express eloquent moral insights by the 
			people of that time; yet they hardly can withstand the sustained 
			critical examination by objective inquirers. The narratives of 
			alleged supernatural intervention that appear in the Bible and the 
			Koran were at first transmitted by oral traditions after the alleged 
			facts occurred. They were written down by second- or third-hand 
			sources, many years and even decades later. They most likely weave 
			into their parables dramatic renditions bordering on fiction, and 
			written by passionate propagandists for new faiths. These sacred 
			books promise believers another world beyond this vale of tears. 
			Their messages of salvation were attractive to countless generations 
			of poor and struggling souls endeavoring to overcome the blows of 
			existential reality. Believers ever since have accepted them as 
			gospel truth; after centuries they became deeply ingrained in the 
			entire fabric of society. Indeed, the great monotheistic religions 
			were eventually intertwined with the dominant political, military, 
			and economic institutions and were enforced by both priestly and 
			secular authorities. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The religion of the ancient 
			Jews, allegedly inspired by Moses and the Old Testament prophets, 
			came to express the ideological yearnings of the Hebrew nation. 
			Christianity was eventually declared to be the state religion by 
			Constantine. Islam, from its inception, was reinforced by the sword 
			of Muhammad. All these faiths, though shrouded in mystery, claim 
			divine sanctification. There are certain common features that each 
			of these religions manifests—historic claims of revelation by 
			charismatic prophets promising eternal salvation; sacred books 
			detailing their miraculous prophecies, prescribing rituals, prayers, 
			and rites of passage; a priestly class that seeks to enforce 
			religious law; great temples, cathedrals, and mosques where the Lord 
			is present in the mysteries of the sacraments. These ancient 
			religions have persisted in part because they have ostracized or 
			condemned heretics and disbelievers. They have gained adherents over 
			time by policies of selective breeding: marriage could only be by 
			members of the same clan or tribe or church, and those who married 
			outside of the faith were disowned. They sought to inculcate and 
			transmit the tenets of the faith to the young, so as to ensure the 
			continuity of the tradition. The entire artistic, moral, 
			philosophical, economic, social, and legal structure of ancient 
			societies were rooted in religious institutions. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many liberal theists would 
			accept the above critique of the historic religions by the “higher 
			criticism,” especially since the German theologian Rudolf Bultmann 
			attempted to demythologize the New Testament. Yet they maintain that 
			the alleged historical events are to be read symbolically or 
			metaphorically and if they are accepted it is because they give 
			meaning and purpose to life. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Interestingly, we now have 
			data from recent religious sects that emerged in the nineteenth 
			century and are not shrouded in historical mystery. And we are close 
			enough to the events to lay bare the factors at work: the historical 
			records of persuasion and conversion on the part of the founders of 
			these new religions, and the willing acceptance of the faith by 
			receptive believers. Thus we may examine the origins of Mormonism, 
			Seventh-Day Adventism, Christian Science, or the Jehovah’s Witness 
			movement to discern if there are similar psycho-bio-sociological 
			patterns at work. Invariably it is difficult to certify their 
			authenticity once the claims to divine revelation are examined by 
			careful historical investigators. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In many new religions the 
			historical records are abundant. In all of these religions, critics 
			have pointed out the role of deception or self-deception, such as 
			Joseph Smith’s writing of the Book of Mormon and his accounts of the 
			golden plates delivered by the angel Moroni, which were subsequently 
			lost by him. Similarly for the claims of plagiarism made against 
			Mary Ellen White, founder of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, or 
			the questionable claims of miraculous health cures by Mary Baker 
			Eddy and other Christian Scientist practitioners. Similarly for the 
			origins of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Closer still, 
			twentieth-century skeptics have been able to witness firsthand the 
			spinning out of New Age paranormal religions. A good illustration of 
			this is the power of suggestion exercised by psychics and mediums, 
			often through the use of deception or self-deception, and the 
			receptiveness of so many believers, all too willing to accept claims 
			of supernormal powers by abandoning rigorous standards of 
			corroboration. These processes are even found among sophisticated 
			scientists (as well as ordinary folks), who are specialists in their 
			fields, but perhaps not in the art of deception. An entire industry 
			claiming to prove another reality transcending this world is 
			flourishing: belief in reincarnation (based on “past-life 
			regressions”) and near-death experiences are often appealed to in 
			order to reinforce belief in the separable existence and immortality 
			of the human soul. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The spawning of space-age 
			religions in the latter half of the twentieth century is especially 
			instructive for the psychobiology of belief. Scientology was 
			invented by L. Ron Hubbard, who began as a writer of science fiction 
			but then went on to consciously create a new religion. Dianetics and 
			all that it proposes are questionable on empirical grounds, yet 
			countless thousands of people, including famous celebrities, have 
			been persuaded to accept its tenets. UFO mythology is especially 
			fascinating. Space Age prophets have emerged, rivaling the classical 
			religious prophets, and likewise claiming deliverance to another 
			realm. The deluded believers in Heaven’s Gate and the Order of the 
			Solar Temple, who committed suicide in order to be transported to a 
			higher realm, are illustrative of the power that these new religions 
			can have on their devotees. Extraterrestrial visitations from on 
			high have the similar contours of alleged early visitations by 
			divine beings and their revelations on Mount Sinai, or in the caves 
			of Hijra outside of Mecca, or on the road to Damascus, or by the 
			Olympian gods of Greek mythology. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus the question is raised 
			anew, How do we explain the willingness of so many people—no doubt a 
			majority of humankind—to outstrip the evidence and to weave out 
			fantasies in which their deepest psychological longings are 
			expressed and their national mythologies fulfilled? How explain the 
			willingness to believe even the most bizarre tales? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have had close contact 
			over the years with a wide range of latter-day religious gurus and 
			mystics—from Reverend Moon to Ernest Angley and Peter Popoff—and 
			paranormal psychics and seers—from Uri Geller to Jeane Dixon and 
			Ramtha. Skeptics have been challenged to account for the apparent 
			extraordinary feats of their proponents. After detailed 
			investigation their weird claims have been debunked; yet in spite of 
			this otherwise sensible people have persisted in beliefs that are 
			patently false. Indeed, there seems to be a bizarre kind of logic at 
			work: belief systems for which there is entirely scanty evidence or 
			no evidence, or indeed abundant evidence to the contrary are 
			fervently accepted; indeed, people will devote their entire lives to 
			a groundless creed. This has been heralded in the past as faith in 
			things unseen or things hoped for. The will to believe in spite of 
			negative evidence has been acclaimed as morally praiseworthy. David 
			Hume thought it a “miracle” that people who believe in miracles are 
			willing to subvert all of the evidence of the senses and the 
			processes of rationality in order to accept their beliefs. </font>
			</p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Explaining Belief</font></h3>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are at least two 
			possible explanations that I wish to focus on. (There are no doubt 
			others, such as the need for identity, ethnicity, the quest for 
			community, the role of indoctrination, the power of tradition, etc.)
			</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In answer to the question, 
			“Why do people believe?,” the first explanation is that believers 
			have not been exposed to the factual critiques of their faith. These 
			critiques apply to the cognitive basis of their belief. There are 
			alternative naturalistic explanations of the alleged phenomena, 
			cognitivists maintain, and if criticisms of the claims were made 
			available to them, they would abandon their irrational beliefs. This 
			is no doubt true of some people, who are committed to inquiry, but 
			not of all, for processes of rationalization intervene to rescue the 
			faith. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Accordingly, a second 
			explanation for this is that noncognitive tendencies and impulses 
			are at work, tempting believers to accept the “unbelievable.” This 
			disposition to believe in spite of insufficient or contrary evidence 
			has deep roots in our biological and social nature. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the first instance, 
			cognition performs a powerful role in human life, liberating us from 
			false ideas. In the form of common sense, it is essential, at least 
			up to a point, if we are to live and function in the real world. 
			Critical thinking is the preeminent instrument of human action; it 
			is the most effective means that we have to fulfill our purposes and 
			solve the problems of living. From it philosophy and science have 
			emerged, contributing to our understanding of nature and ourselves.
			</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We all know that we need to 
			use practical reason to deal with empirical questions, such as: “Is 
			it snowing outside?” or “How do I cope with my toothache?” And we 
			also apply such methods within the sciences, to deal with issues 
			such as the following: “The dinosaurs were most likely extinguished 
			by an asteroid impact some sixty-five million years ago.” Or, “We 
			are unable to cure people by therapeutic touch.” Each of these 
			beliefs may be tested by the experimental evidence or by theories 
			accepted as probable or improbable on the basis of these 
			considerations. In addition, an open-minded inquirer may be led to 
			accept or reject any number of propositions, which he or she 
			previously asserted, such as, “There is no evidence that a great 
			flood engulfed the entire globe as related in the Bible.” </font>
			</p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a class of 
			overbeliefs, however, for which no amount of evidence seems to 
			suffice, at least for some people. These generally may be classified 
			as “transcendental beliefs.” It is here that faith or the will to 
			believe intervenes. By the “transcendental,” I mean that which is 
			over and beyond normal observations or rational coherence, and is 
			enhanced by mystery and magic. This surely is what the great mystics 
			have referred to as the “ineffable” depths of Being. Scientific 
			inquiry is naturalistic; that is, it attempts to uncover the natural 
			causes at work. Granted that these are often hidden causes, unseen 
			by unaided observation, such as microbes or atoms; yet such causes 
			can be confirmed by some measure of verification; they fit into a 
			conceptual framework; and their explanatory value can be 
			corroborated by a community of independent inquirers. Transcendental 
			explanations are, by definition, nonnatural; they cannot be 
			confirmed experimentally; they cannot be corroborated objectively.
			</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We may ask, “Why do many 
			people accept unverified occult explanations when they are clothed 
			in religious or paranormal guise?” The answer, I think, in part at 
			least, is because such accounts arouse awe and entice the passionate 
			imagination. In an earlier book I have labeled this “the 
			transcendental temptation,”1 the temptation to believe in things 
			unseen, because they satisfy felt needs and desires. The 
			transcendental temptation has various dimensions. It was resorted to 
			by primitive men and women, unable to cope with the intractable in 
			nature, unmitigated disasters, unbearable pain or sorrow. It is 
			drawn upon by humans in order to assuage the dread of death—by 
			postulating another dimension to existence, the hope for an 
			afterlife in which the evils and injustices of this world are 
			overcome. The lure of the transcendental temptation appeals to the 
			frail and forlorn. There may not be any evidence for a 
			transcendental realm; but the emotive and intellectual desire to 
			submit to it can provide a source of comfort and consolation. To 
			believe that we will meet in another life those whom we have loved 
			in this life can be immensely satisfying, or at least it can provide 
			some saving grace. It may enable a person to get through the 
			grievous losses that he or she suffers in this life. If I can’t be 
			with those I cherish today, I can at least do so in my dreams and 
			fantasies, and if I submit to and propitiate the unseen powers that 
			govern the universe this will miraculously right the wrongs that I 
			have endured in this vale of tears. Thus the transcendental 
			temptation is tempting because it enables human beings to survive 
			the often cruel trials and tribulations that are our constant 
			companion, and it enables us to endure this life in anticipation of 
			the next. It is the mystery and magic of religion, its incantations 
			and rituals, that fan the passions of overbelief, and nourish 
			illusion and unreality. There is a real and dangerous world out 
			there that primitive and modern humans need to cope with—wild 
			animals and marauding tribes, droughts and famine, lightning and 
			forest fires, calamities and deprivation, accidents and 
			contingencies. Surely, there is pleasure and satisfaction, 
			achievement, and realization in life, but also tragedy and failure, 
			defeat, and bitterness. Our world is a complex tapestry of joy and 
			suffering. The transcendental temptation thus can provide a powerful 
			palliative enabling humans to cope with the unbearable, overcome 
			mortality, and finitude; and it does so by creating fanciful systems 
			of religious overbelief in which priests and prophets propitiate the 
			unseen sources of power and thus shield us from the vicissitudes of 
			fortune. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is only in recent human 
			history that the species has gradually been able to overcome 
			mythological explanations. Philosophy and metaphysics emerged, 
			attempting to account for the world of change and flux in terms of 
			rational explanations; modern science succeeded where pure 
			speculation failed, by using powerful cognitive methods of 
			experimental verification and mathematical inference. Diseases did 
			not have satanic origins, but natural explanations and cures. The 
			weather could be interpreted, not as a product of divine wrath or 
			favor, but in meteorological terms. Astrology’s heavenly omens and 
			signs were replaced by the regularities discernible by physics and 
			astronomy. Science abandoned occult for material causes. It is the 
			foe of magical thinking, and it is able to proceed by refusing to 
			submit to the transcendental temptation, at least in dealing with 
			the empirical world. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet there still remained a 
			residue of unanswered questions, and it is here in the swamp of the 
			unknowable that the transcendental temptation festers. This 
			beguiling temptation reaches beyond the natural world by sheer force 
			of habit and passion, and it resists all efforts to contain it. 
			Rather than suspend judgments about those questions for which there 
			is no evidence either way, it leaps in to fill the void and comfort 
			the aching soul. It is the most frequent salve used to calm 
			existential fear and trembling. Why is this so? Because I think that 
			the temptation has its roots in a tendency, and this in a 
			disposition. In other words, there is most likely within the human 
			species a genetic component, which is stronger than temptation and 
			weaker than instinct. The hypothesis that I wish to offer is that 
			the belief in the efficacy of prayer and the submission to divine 
			power persists because it has had some survival value in the infancy 
			of the race; powerful psycho-sociobiological factors are thus at 
			work, predisposing humans to submit to the temptation. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The cognitive explanation 
			for its persistence is that there is cognitive dissonance or 
			misinformation that is the root cause for the fixation on the 
			transcendental and that this can be overcome by rational inquiry. 
			Socrates thought that faith persisted only because of ignorance, and 
			that knowledge would disabuse us of religious myths. This surely 
			continues to play a powerful role in regard to the content of our 
			beliefs. Yet I submit that there is another factor present, which 
			explains the persistence of religiosity, and this is an evolutionary 
			explanation; that is, belief in the transcendental had adaptive 
			value, and those tribes or clans that believed in unseen myths and 
			forces to whom they propitiated by ritual and prayer had a tendency 
			to survive and to pass on this genetic predisposition to their 
			offspring. Thus religiosity is a “heritable” factor within the naked 
			human ape.2 </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What are some of the data in 
			support of a transcendental predisposition? There are the University 
			of Minnesota studies of identical twins,3 which showed that a 
			significant number of infants who were separated at birth and reared 
			apart under different environmental conditions, nonetheless 
			exhibited similar tastes and preferences, and in this case exhibited 
			a tendency to be religious. This predisposition is not necessarily 
			deterministic in a strict sense, and it is absent in a number of 
			cases. The heritable factor is estimated to be 50%. E.&nbsp;O. Wilson 
			also maintains that there is some biological basis for religiosity; 
			although one cannot locate this in a specific gene, there are a 
			multiplicity of genetic factors and epigenetic rules.4 He argues 
			that theological overbeliefs offer consolation in the face of 
			adversity, and that these religious overbeliefs—whether true or 
			false—provide a functional means of adaptation. Those tribes or 
			clans that possessed a safety net of such beliefs and practices may 
			have been better able to cope with the fear of death, and they were 
			also able to pass along to future generations the tendency to be 
			religious. This proclivity may have had some survival value and thus 
			it was transmitted to future generations. E.&nbsp;O. Wilson maintains 
			that “there is a hereditary selective advantage to members in a 
			powerful group united by devout belief and purpose. . . . Much if 
			not all religious behavior could have arisen from evolution by 
			natural selection.”5 </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a growing body of 
			scientific research that supports this sociobiological explanation: 
			this includes two components: (1)&nbsp;psycho-biological, which has some 
			genetic basis, and (2)&nbsp;sociological, which has roots in cultural 
			memes and habits. This would involve a coeval gene-meme hypothesis. 
			Evolution is a function of both our genes on the one hand and memes 
			transmitted by culture and inculcated in the young on the other.6 
			Thus, both hereditary and environmental factors have an influence on 
			the behavior of individuals. Though there may be a predisposition 
			toward belief in the transcendental, how it is expressed and the 
			content of the beliefs depends on the culture. </font></p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Reasons for Disbelief</font></h3>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We need also to ask, Why do 
			some humans disbelieve? — for there is a minority of people who 
			remain unbelievers, agnostics, or atheists.7 There are a number of 
			important research projects that I think should be undertaken. To 
			ascertain if there is a genetic tendency — or lack of it — we should 
			study the family trees of both believers and unbelievers. Much the 
			same as we can trace the physical characteristics, such as eye or 
			hair color, short or tall stature, and even genetic diseases in some 
			family stocks, so we should be able to trace the religiosity factor, 
			especially in twins and/or siblings who are reared apart. If we can 
			measure musical talent (MQ) or intelligence (IQ), then perhaps we 
			can also measure the religious quotient (RQ). Similarly, we need to 
			trace the family trees of unbelievers and ask, Is the genetic factor 
			absent and if so to what extent and why? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have met a great number of 
			unbelievers over the years who tell me that they have been atheists 
			for as long as they could remember, that they never could accept the 
			dominant religious creed, even though many were indoctrinated into 
			it from the earliest. Clearly, we need to go beyond anecdotal 
			autobiographical accounts to systematic studies of how and why 
			people become disbelievers. Many atheists, on the other hand, have 
			related that their unbelief was a result of a slow cognitive process 
			of critical reflection. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bruce Hunsberger and Bob 
			Altemeyer, in an important study,8 have attempted to outline the 
			processes of conversion and deconversion in students that they 
			studied in universities in Canada. Edward Babinsky9 has published 
			autobiographical accounts of people who abandoned their religiosity. 
			We need to study the processes of deconversion for possible 
			explanations: Why do people who were religiously indoctrinated 
			reject their beliefs, how rapidly did they do so, and for what 
			reasons or causes? Conversely, what processes are involved in moving 
			from a state of unbelief to religious conviction? Hunsberger and 
			Altemeyer have suggested in their study of students that the process 
			of deconversion was predominantly a slow, cognitive process; and 
			that of conversion a rather rapid emotional transformation. </font>
			</p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We need to examine the 
			sociocultural contexts in which religious ideas appear and 
			disappear. We have an excellent data pool today in Russia and 
			Eastern Europe where atheism was the official doctrine of the state. 
			Here enormous efforts were expended for 50 to 75 years to pursue 
			ideological policies of indoctrination and propaganda, designed to 
			discourage religious belief and encourage atheism. We may ask, What 
			has happened in these countries since the collapse of communism? Is 
			the past political-social influence of atheism enduring, leaving a 
			permanent residue, or is it dissipating? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly, many Western 
			European countries have seen a rather rapid decline in traditional 
			religion since World War&nbsp;II, especially under the influence of 
			liberalism and humanism. For example, in The Netherlands before the 
			war, approximately half of the population identified with Roman 
			Catholicism and half with Protestantism, with a small percentage of 
			Jews and other minorities. This has changed since World War&nbsp;II, and 
			there is now a higher percentage of humanists than either 
			Protestants or Catholics. Similar processes have been observed in 
			Norway, England, France, and elsewhere. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Curiously, only 6% to 8% of 
			the American population may be classified as unbelievers.10 Can we 
			give an account of why this is so and why American society seems to 
			be anomalous, at least in comparison with Western Europe? 
			Interestingly, some 60% of American scientists, and 93% of so-called 
			elite scientists according to a recent poll, are classified as 
			unbelievers. Why does this happen? Are there cognitive factors 
			primarily at work? Or are disbelievers anomalous — lacking the 
			genetic disposition? Or, on the contrary, do they represent an 
			advanced form of the evolution of the species? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A key factor in the growth 
			of religion or atheism undoubtedly is a function of the 
			sociocultural influences that prevail. Historically, the orthodox 
			religions have sought to punish heresy or blasphemy as high crimes. 
			Infidels have often been excommunicated or burned at the stake. It 
			is only in recent times that democratic societies have recognized, 
			let alone permitted or encouraged religious dissenters to flourish. 
			One might ask, If conditions of tolerance, indeed encouragement, 
			were to prevail, to what extent would religious beliefs wane or be 
			altered? What are the environmental conditions by which atheism can 
			be induced? What kind of educational curricula would most likely 
			stimulate unbelief? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A key issue that can be 
			raised concerns the difference between the content of the core 
			beliefs and practices of a religion and the function of the beliefs 
			and practices. The content may change over time, and there may be an 
			erosion of traditional beliefs, and their modification may be due to 
			cognitive criticisms; but alternative creed-practices may emerge, 
			satisfying similar psychological-biological-sociological needs and 
			functions. In this regard, I reiterate, we are not dealing with the 
			kind of religion that persists or the status of its truth 
			claims—which may be irrelevant for many believers—but with the power 
			of religious symbols and institutions to provide structure and 
			order, and to give purpose in an otherwise meaningless and perhaps 
			terrifying universe. </font></p>
			<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What Can We Do?</font></h3>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If science confirms the 
			hypothesis that there are deep sociobiological forces responsible, 
			at least in part, for religiosity in the species, then we need to 
			ask, What can we do about it, if anything? Cognitivists will say 
			that we still should constantly strive to engage in criticism of 
			outrageous doctrines. At the very least this will help to restrain 
			and temper religious fanaticism, protect the rights of unbelievers, 
			and perhaps develop an ethic of tolerance. If religiosity will most 
			likely be with us in one form or another in the foreseeable future, 
			can we develop secular and naturalistic substitutes or moral 
			equivalents for the passionate longing for meaning? Can we serve up 
			sufficient balm to soothe existential weltschmerz? Can we develop 
			new symbols to inspire meaning and hope? Can we engender the courage 
			to be and to become? In other words, can secular humanism offer a 
			message as potent as theistic mythology? These are the kinds of 
			questions that we hope the science of religion will help us to 
			solve.</font>&nbsp; </p>
