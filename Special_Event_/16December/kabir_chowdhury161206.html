	on
	December 16, 2006</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Wars of liberation have always 
	exerted a deep and widespread influence on the literature of the peoples 
	concerned. The patriotic and revolutionary zeal as well as the exaltation 
	and suffering accompanying such wars have left their mark on the creative 
	writing of man in our lime and before. If one views liberation wars as not 
	limited only to the struggle against a foreign colonial power but from a 
	wider perspective, one is likely lo recall in this context such writers, 
	among others, as Maxim Gorky and Mayakovsky of Russia. Ivan Vazor and 
	Nikolai Vaptsarov of Bulgaria. Garcia Lorca of Spain, Louis Aragon and Paul 
	Eluard of France. Bertolt Brccht of Germany. Nazim Hikmet of Turkey, Pablo 
	Neruda of Chile and Augustine Neto of Angola. However in this article we do 
	not propose to take such a broad view of the subject. For our purposes here. 
	by liberation war we shall mean the war waged by the people of Bangladesh in 
	1971 against the Pakistani neocolonial occupation forces, at the successful 
	conclusion of which Bangladesh emerged as a sovereign and independent nation 
	in December of that year ; and by creative writing we shall mean poems, 
	short stories, novels and plays, the universally recognized major forms of 
	literature.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ruthless exploitation of the 
	Bengali people, the people of the then East Pakistan, politically, 
	economically and culturally, by the Pakistani rulers for over two decades 
	and finally the genocide unleashed on them by the Pakistani military junta 
	in March 1971 made the liberation war of Bangladesh historically inevitable. 
	It was a people's war in every sense of the term. The entire population of 
	occupied Bangladesh, barring a few quislings, rose against the occupation 
	army. The writers, too, played their part. Some of them not only wielded 
	their pens but also literally took up arms and fought in different sectors 
	of the war. The experiences of the liberation war inspired our writers to 
	write on this theme. As a result, we have a sizeable body of creative 
	writing based on it, practically in all the genres of our literature.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the creative writing of 
	Bangladesh inspired by the liberation war, one finds, at one level, the 
	picture of the heroic struggle of the freedom fighters, the fear and 
	anxiety-ridden life of the common people in captive Bangladesh while the 
	liberation war was being waged, the vile deeds of the brutal Pakistani 
	occupation soldiers and the inhuman torture suffered by the activists of our 
	resistance movement in the enemy's prison camps. At another level one finds, 
	along with the note of revolutionary ardor, a desire for a new way of life, 
	free from tyranny and exploitation, dreams of a society where secular, 
	democratic and egalitarian values would prevail. While our creative writing 
	has been reflecting these elements in varying degrees since the liberation 
	war, I must say that it cannot always lay claim to much literary merit or 
	artistic excellence. Not infrequently, it is melodramatic and sentimental; 
	it lacks genuine feeling and betrays signs of an artificial design; and it 
	often merits classification as journalistic or documentary rather than 
	authentic creative writing. In spite of the above critical comments, 
	however, a general examination of the creative writing of Bangladesh 
	connected with its liberation war is not without a certain interest.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us, first, take a look at 
	poetry: while dealing with the theme of liberation war, our poets present 
	such diverse emotions as hope, anger, despair, heroic protest and 
	unflinching determination. During the early years of independence, a note of 
	joy and hope dominated. But later, as the anxiously awaited fruit of 
	independence, that is, a positive improvement in the quality of life of the 
	common man, receded further and further, that note was replaced by one of 
	disillusionment, satire and criticism. Let me quote for the readers some 
	extracts from a few poems by some of our well-established poets which will 
	give them some idea of our poets, diverse approaches to a common theme. Here 
	is a quotation from Shamsur Rahnian's poem called <b><i>No. I shall not go.</i></b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">&quot;Now a days I hardly come across<br>
	a familiar face anywhere.<br>
	Many of my friends have left<br>
	the country.</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">In fact, pursued by fear,<br>
	thousands of men and women<br>
	are daily fleeing, leaving their<br>
	homestead behind.</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Yet, I shall not go, no never,<br>
	to any other place,<br>
	I shall stay here with them<br>
	whose fate, every agonized moment<br>
	is to wait for certain death<br>
	before a finny squad.&quot;</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In another famous poem by the same 
	poet called, <i><b>Liberty, you are</b></i> one finds a different note 
	altogether; joyous, hopeful, and romantic, replete with evocative imagery. 
	Here is an extract from that poem:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&quot;Liberty you are my mother's 
	white sari<br>
	fluttering in the breeze in the yard,<br>
	Liberty, you are the red color of m<i>ehdi</i><br>
	on the lender palm of my sister.<br>
	Liberty, you are die naming poster<br>
	in my friend's hand.<br>
	Liberty, you are the thick black<br>
	loose hair of my wife<br>
	flowing in the wind.<br>
	Liberty, you are the colored shirt<br>
	on my son,<br>
	the play of sunlight on<br>
	my daughter's cheek.<br>
	Liberty, you tire my garden,<br>
	the song of the cuckoo,<br>
	the rustling leaves<br>
	of an ancient banyan tree,<br>
	the note book where I write my verses<br>
	just as I choose.&quot;</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet again in another poem by Shamsur 
	Rahman, instead of the tender, romantic, happy note one comes across a note 
	of fierce anger and hitter hatred. I quote a few lines from the poem <i><b>I 
	Curse Them.</b></i></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">&quot;I curse today those devils of 
	hell<br>
	who compelled me to run up the stairs<br>
	with my feet deep in the blood<br>
	of my parents,<br>
	float on rivers,<br>
	and make my bed in wild forests.<br>
	I curse them :<br>
	let them forever wander<br>
	with rotting bodies<br>
	hung around their emaciated necks.<br>
	I curse them:<br>
	when at the close of each day<br>
	they beg on their knees<br>
	for a piece of dry bread.<br>
	It will always stay ten feet away<br>
	from their outstretched palms.<br>
	I curse them:<br>
	their cup for quenching thirst<br>
	will always fill to the brim<br>
	with blood,<br>
	the blood with which they flooded<br>
	the soil of Bengal.<br>
	I curse them !&quot;</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me quote a perceptive Indian 
	critic's comment on this poem:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;There are not many poems in any 
	language to compare with the concentrated fury and corrosive anger of this, 
	unless one goes to Isaiah or Ezekiel or Jeremiah&quot;(Amalendu Bose in the 
	introduction to <i>Shamsur Rahman: Writers' Workshop, Calcutta, 1975</i>).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In many poems inspired by our 
	liberation war one finds powerfully projected the conviction that the 
	people's firm determination, courageous heart and the justness of their 
	cause will surely triumph over the superior armed might of the evil enemy. 
	One recalls, for example, The opening lines of Syed Shamsul Haq's poem <b>
	<i>March 01. 1971</i></b>, which go like this:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&quot;See, I am unarmed, but<br>
		I have a kind of weapon that is<br>
		never exhausted, which with every use<br>
		only grows sharper and sharper -<br>
		my life.<br>
		I don't have only<br>
		one life,<br>
		but millions and millions of lives.<br>
		See, I do not have a flag<br>
		in my hand,<br>
		but the flag I possess<br>
		is not raised on the mast<br>
		of some braggart -<br>
		my flag is my mother's face.<br>
		I do not have only one mother,<br>
		but millions and millions of mothers.&quot;</b></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One comes across the same theme, 
	glowing with moving imagery, in Nirmalendu Goon's poem <i><b>Firearm</b></i> 
	which I quote below in full:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&quot;There is a big crowd at the 
		police station.<br>
		Suspicious soldiers of the city<br>
		are receiving firearms.<br>
		Frightened citizens,<br>
		in accordance with the directives<br>
		of the occupation military forces,<br>
		are depositing their shot guns,<br>
		rifles, pistols and cartridges.<br>
		like promised offerings at a holy shrine -<br>
		on the table lay the saint's hand<br>
		like a flower.<br>
		Only I, disregarding the military directive,<br>
		turned mildly rebellious,<br>
		I am openly returning home,<br>
		and yet with me<br>
		a terrible firearm, my heart,<br>
		I didn't surrender it.&quot;</b></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But besides the note of anger, hope 
	or pride, some of our poems, after the&nbsp; first flush of independence 
	following the successful termination of the&nbsp; liberation war reveal a 
	different emotion- They are full of frustration, resentment, satire and 
	harsh criticism. One recalls Ahul Husain's poem called <b><i>We, too have a 
	land </i></b>&nbsp;where the poet lashes out against political chauvinism and 
	says that our land exists in the songs of the poets, in the slogans shouted 
	at public meetings, and on the maps in hooks of geography. One finds the 
	spirit of resentment, against self seeking political leaders who failed to 
	provide a square meal to the hungry people in independent Bangladesh, more 
	directly expressed in Rafiq Azad's famous poem - <b><i>Give me Food, Bastard</i></b>, 
	whose closing lines are:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&quot;This simple hunger for food<br>
		if allowed to grow and encompass<br>
		everything,<br>
		can surely bring about a disastrous<br>
		end.<br>
		Devouring everything from the sight<br>
		to the seen<br>
		I shall at last eat up, one by one.<br>
		shrubs and trees,<br>
		lakes and rivers,<br>
		villages and cities,<br>
		sidewalks, flowing waters of the sewers,<br>
		streams of&nbsp; people walking on the streets,<br>
		women, all bottom and hips,<br>
		the Food Minister and his flag-flying<br>
		limousine -<br>
		today nothing, absolutely nothing,<br>
		will be unacceptable to me.<br>
		Give me food, you bastard,<br>
		or I will eat up the very map.&quot;</b></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is not a single reputed poet 
	of Bangladesh, old or young who has not written on the theme of our 
	liberation war. And many other poets, not yet established or widely known, 
	have also written on that theme. An anthology called <i>Poems of Liberation 
	War</i>, containing one hundred poems by fifty four poets, edited by Abul 
	Hasnat was published in 1984. In the introduction to that volume Shumsur 
	Rahman, perhaps the most widely read and admired poet of Bangladesh, wrote&quot;-</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>&quot;I consider the poems 
		enclosed within the two covers of this book an aesthetic document of our 
		liberation war. I'll not make the absurd claim that every single line of 
		the poems anthologized here is artistically satisfying, but I'll 
		unhesitatingly say that these poems enshrine in them the agony of 
		blood-drenched occupied Bangladesh, the silent processions of a people 
		in despair, the resonant sound of the footsteps of freedom-fighters, a 
		deep love for the motherland and a poem of humanity&quot;.</i></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rahman went on to add that the 
	liberation war had provided a new turning point in the poetry of Bangladesh 
	and that the experience enabled her poets to blossom in newer ways. The 
	above assessment is perhaps over- generous, though it must be said that any 
	discussion of the poetry of Bangladesh, from whatever angle one may choose 
	to look at it, will remain grossly incomplete if the theme of the liberation 
	war is left out of consideration.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the field of fiction, too, one 
	finds the experiences of the liberation war providing our writers a major 
	theme. Anwar Pasha's <i><b>Rifle Roli Awrat</b></i> (Rifle, Bread, Women)&nbsp; 
	was written in 1971 in captive Dhaka even as the liberation war was being 
	planned and organized by the resistance workers. This our first novel of 
	liberation war is remarkable on many counts. One is immediately struck by 
	the central character's humanism, liberal ideas, secular outlook, and 
	commitment to life and progress. Towards the end of the hook the author 
	gives Sudipta, the hero, an opportunity to witness the joining of forces by 
	Bula, the communist leader, and Jamal, the nationalist activist, as if to 
	highlight The importance of such unity in a national liberation struggle. 
	The novel also successfully presents the picture of opportunists and 
	self-seekers. who have neither a sense of personal honor nor any love for 
	their native land. But their portrayals are notable for their restraint and 
	avoidance of venom or bitterness. In fact a warm humanism permeates the 
	entire hook and yet it was Anwar Pasha's tragic fate to he picked up from 
	his home and killed by the fascist collaborators of the occupation army just 
	two days before Bangladesh was liberated.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Among other novels of our liberation 
	war one recalls easily Showkat Osman's - <i><b>Jnhannam Hoite Bidai</b></i> 
	(Departure from Hell). <i><b>Nekre Aronyo</b></i> (Of Wolves and the 
	Jungle), <i><b>Dui Sainik</b></i> (Two Soldiers) and <b><i>Jalangee</i></b> 
	(The River); Showkat Ali's <i><b>Yatra </b></i>(The Exodus); Amjad Husain's
	<i><b>Obeldi Osomoye</b></i> (Bad Time Inopportune Hour); Syed Shamsul Haq's
	<b><i>Neel Dongshon</i></b> (Blue Bite); <i><b>Nishiddho Loban</b></i> 
	(Forbidden Incense ); Rashid Hyder's <b><i>Khanchai</i></b> (In the Cage);
	<b><i>Ondho Kothamala </i></b>(Blind Verses) and <i><b>Nosto Josnai E Kon 
	Aronyo</b></i> (What a Forest is this in Rotten Moonlight); Rabeya Khalun's
	<b><i>Ferari Shurjo </i></b>(The Absconding Sun); Ahmed Safa's <b><i>Omkar</i></b> 
	(The Sound of Om); and Selina Husain's <i><b>Hangor, Nadi. Grenade</b></i> 
	(Shark, River and Grenade). In these works we find reflected. sometimes 
	authentically and with sensitivity, sometimes with a certain exaggeration 
	and melodrama, the hopes, fears and anxieties of those difficult days ; a 
	vivid, passionate and powerful indictment of the atrocities perpetrated on 
	our people by the enemy soldiers and the death-defying heroism and 
	self-sacrifice of our humble unlettered common folk. Showkat Osman's slim 
	and episodic novel <i>Nekre Aronyo</i> has been called a precious spiritual 
	document of the liberation war of Bangladesh by one of ours critics; Syed 
	Haq's two novels are characterized by sophisticated treatment of brutal 
	incidents and a subtle manipulation of language; Selina Husain's novel, set 
	in a remote riverine rural area of southern Bangladesh, dealing with 
	illiterate common men and women, achieves a commendable integration of theme 
	and style and brilliantly highlights the essence of all that is heroic, 
	noble and glorious in our freedom struggle.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In spite of the basic unity in 
	regard to theme, one notices clear diversity in the approach, background 
	material, and style employed by our writers in their works on the subject. 
	Sometimes the novelists have recourse to explicit symbolism as in Khcmchai 
	or Omkar; sometimes they employ the flash-back technique as in Ondho 
	Kathamala; sometimes they deal with middle-class urban characters as in <i>
	Yatra</i>, sometimes the selling is in rural Bangladesh as in <i>Dui Sainik</i>; 
	sometimes they project the overpowering feeling of despair and frustration 
	among the erstwhile freedom-lighters as they see in post-war liberated 
	Bangladesh their hopes of building a new way of life receding further and 
	further as in <i>Nashto Joisnai E Kon Aronya.</i></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One finds associations of the 
	liberation war of Bangladesh in Mahmudul Haq's <b><i>Jivan Amur Bon</i></b> 
	(Life, My Sister), too, but the romantic overtones of love, mixed with sex. 
	predominate there and the hero seems to he knocked out by a sense of 
	defeatism and ennui. Rashid Karim's <b><i>Amar Yoto Glani</i></b> (All My 
	Shame) also has associations of our freedom movement but it revolves more 
	around the hero's personal problems and his morbid self-analysis than around 
	the larger issue of the liberation war with its multiple ramifications. 
	However, from the point of view of literary craftsmanship, psychological 
	insight into characters, and manipulation of language, Rashid Karim's novel 
	has certain positive merits. One could say nearly the same thing about 
	Mahmudul Haq's <i>Jivan Amur Bon</i>, although as a novel of the liberation 
	war, thematically speaking, a more attractive work is Hahib Harun's <i><b>
	Priyo Yoddha. Priyotomo</b></i> (Beloved Warrior, Dearest), which, 
	interestingly, is developed in the background of the liberation struggles of 
	Bangladesh and Yugoslavia, not directly, hut through reminiscences, when the 
	hero, a wounded freedom fighter goes to Yugoslavia from Bangladesh for 
	medical treatment.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When all is said and done, I must 
	say that, generally speaking, our novels having to do with the liberation 
	war fail to capture and reveal the essence of (hat traumatic and cataclysmic 
	event with real artistic excellence. Most of our novels dealing with this 
	theme arc slight, both in scope, planning and execution. Many are, in fact, 
	novelettes, rather than novels proper. Many again, rely too heavily on lurid 
	imagination, melodrama and high-strung emotionalism. World literature has 
	given us some remarkable novels in this area with truly epic dimensions. We 
	are still awaiting such works from our novelists.</font></p>
