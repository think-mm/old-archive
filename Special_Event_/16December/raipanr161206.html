	<p>&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Genocide is defined as the deliberate and systematic destruction of a 
	racial, political, or cultural group. The world has suffered much genocide 
	in human history and, despite progress of civilization; their scope and 
	enormity have not decreased. Genocide is one of the worst crimes against 
	humanity. </p>
	<p>The mass killings in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) in 1971 are the most 
	concentrated act of genocide in the twentieth century. In an attempt to 
	crush forces seeking independence for East Pakistan, the West Pakistani 
	military regime unleashed a systematic campaign of mass murder which aimed 
	at killing millions of Bengalis, and likely succeeded in doing so. </p>
	<p>There is no denying that things in Bangladesh today are not as they ought 
	to be, let alone what they promised to be. After the bloody war of 
	independence which in 1971 secured an independent state from rule by 
	Pakistan, the nation's first top two executives– Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 
	Ziaur Rahman – were assassinated. Between 1974 and 1990 the country was 
	governed largely under states of emergency or martial law. But is Bangladesh 
	now out of autocracy or enjoying fruit of independence after thirty five 
	years! </p>
	<p>The political parties in Bangladesh have put the country across an 
	unsurmountable political divide while Bangladesh is celebrating its thirty 
	five victory day on December 16, 2006. They use government institutions and 
	officials, law enforcement agencies, or even the court for the volatile 
	political practices. They don’t care any human rights. </p>
	<p>After thirty five years, people of Bangladesh are really facing a mortal 
	challenge while they are remembering the soul-lifting sacrifices and 
	gallantry of the country’s bravest and enlightened sons on December 14, 
	2006. The nine-month-long genocide ended with the killing of teachers, 
	writers, journalists, professionals, and social thinkers which was the last 
	part of the Yahya-Tikka-Niazi blueprint. </p>
	<p>But till now, is Bangladesh free from any blueprint? Secularism, 
	democracy, even tolerance, and communal harmony are being thrown overboard 
	today. </p>
	<p>The same question had been raised at The Heritage Foundation's Lehrman 
	Auditorium, Washington, U.S.A on December 14, 2006, under the title, 
	“Elections in Bangladesh: A Critical Moment for the Country's Future.” As a 
	key speaker, Mr. Richard Boucher, assistant secretary of state for South and 
	Central Asia, described his recent visit to Bangladesh. He mentioned that 
	the incidents of extremist violence and volatile political practices over 
	the last couple of years have begun to tear at the fabric of its moderate 
	and pluralistic society. </p>
	<p>Meanwhile on the same day (December 14, 2006), Secretary of the United 
	State Condoleezza Rice announced some new initiatives to defend the 
	defenders. According to her declaration to strengthen the impact of 
	democratic movement, human rights initiative, and other policies supporting 
	those that work for freedom and liberty, United States always takes 
	initiatives to institutionalize those freedom agenda. </p>
	<p>The reason is to mention these initiatives to which people of Bangladesh 
	need to defend? People who are fighting for democracy, human rights, freedom 
	and liberty, or those who are busy to destroy everything? </p>
	<p>The latest example of using the court for political purpose is the 
	high-court verdict of former president of Bangladesh and chairman of Jatiyo 
	Party Hussain Mohamad Ershad. The High Court of Bangladesh passed the order 
	dismissing his appeal against the trial-court verdict that had sentenced him 
	to three years in prison with a fine of Tk 10,000. As Mr. Ershad has a big 
	influence in the next general election, the judgment was given from the 
	political point of view. The High Court upheld the trial court's judgment 
	but commuted the jail term by a year, which means he will have to suffer in 
	jail for two years. </p>
	<p>According to the spokesman Brad Adams of U.S based Human Rights Watch; 
	Bangladesh’s Rapid Action Battalion has become a government death squad. 
	Human Rights Watch warned in a report released on December 14, 2006 that 
	Bangladesh’s elite anti-crime and anti-terrorism security force could be 
	used for political purposes prior to elections slated for January 23, 2007. 
	They are already responsible for widespread torture and killing more than 
	350 suspects in custody. It’s all similar like the attitude of Pakistan 
	Government in 1971. </p>
	<p>What difference if Bangladesh has independence and the incident of rape 
	of destitute Hindu Minority women still continues like the time of 
	liberation war in 1971! </p>
	<p>Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities (HRCBM) and Global Human 
	Rights Defense (GHRD) put forward to the Caretaker Government a 15-point 
	recommendation, including formation of a Minority Human Rights Commission, 
	to prevent torture against the religious minority in a press conference on 
	Friday, December 9, 2006. The leaders urged that the government should start 
	speedy trial of the fundamentalists and terrorists give exemplary punishment 
	to the rapists and hand over the property of minorities to the real owners. 
	According to HRCBM and GHRD, a total of 62 incidents of repression on 
	minorities took place in the month of November, 2006. </p>
	<p>In addition, Bangladesh is experiencing a significant rise in militant 
	Islam in recent years just like 1971. Since 1999, attacks by Islamist 
	militants have been increasing. They have targeted opposition politicians, 
	scholars, journalists, members of the judiciary, and religious minorities.
	</p>
	<p>About 3,279 people were killed in different incidents across the country 
	in 11 months from January to November, 2006. About 9.69 persons were killed 
	everyday on an average, said a survey report, reports UNB. The number of 
	injured included 167 journalists, 96 in acid attack, 46 for dowry, four for 
	fatwa and 124 fell victims of traffickers. </p>
	<p>After taking over, President-cum-chief adviser Professor Iazuddin Ahmed 
	immediately appointed ten other advisors as required by the constitution. 
	From the very beginning, he is pushing the country towards confrontation and 
	uncertainty by keeping the advisers in the dark and turning the Bangabhaban 
	(President’s office cum residence) into one place of power generating. Then 
	resignation of the four advisers and appointment of new advisers according 
	to the choice of President is an example of autocracy. He always prefers to 
	address the nations at late night. No body knows why? </p>
	<p>Freedom fighters are not getting any favor from the Government. Very 
	often they are found to suffer due to foods, shelters, and other minimum 
	level of livings. Whereas, they should be highly treated from the state. But 
	the whole picture is different. </p>
	<p>Thirty-five years is perhaps a short time in the life of a nation to 
	resolve its identity issues, but it cannot be denied that Bangladesh is at a 
	crossroads and must act before it is too late. Nationalism is like Proteus, 
	the Greek sea god, who was able to take any shape he wished but changed only 
	to prevent change. For Bangladesh, the challenge is to bring about change 
	that is conducive to its growth and stability. </p>
