	<p align="justify"><i>One of the greatest shortcomings in the perception of our fight for 
	Independence is our consistent failure to recognise the role of women in our 
	Liberation War. In fact, the role of women is largely ignored, denied and 
	misconstrued in our mainstream history. This is because of our general 
	tendency to think of war only in terms of physical fighting and exchange of 
	gunshots. But our liberation war or any war for that matter, which has 
	involved the entire population of the country, has been a struggle through 
	which a united nation has asserted its aspiration for freedom. Such wars are 
	not fought only in the battlefields, neither are they fought only with guns. 
	War heroes include those women who have supported the valiant freedom 
	fighters with food, shelter, funds; who have nursed the wounded and hid 
	weapons risking their own lives. They also include those who have willingly 
	given their sons to war, who have lost their loved ones and even worse been 
	subjected to sexual abuse and still survived to tell their stories. </i> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Maiful fought in a battle against the Pak army. Her husband Jalil Molla 
	was shot and died soon after. - Courtesy 'Muktir Kotha' </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bir Protik Taramon Bibi fought against Pakistanis in the liberation war 
	in her village home in Shankar Madhabpur Kurigram. She was in Sector 11 
	under the leadership of Sector commander Abu Taher, Bir Uttam. Bangabandhu 
	Sheikh Mujibor Rahman's Government honoured her with the Bir Protik title in 
	1973, for her courageous role in resisting the Pakistan occupation force 
	with weapons. After independence, there was no trace of her whereabouts. In 
	1995, a researcher found out where she lived and consequently the women's 
	organisations brought her to Dhaka. Her story of bravery was soon published. 
	Taramon Bibi was honoured with the prestigious Bir Protik title 24 years 
	after the war in 1995. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia handed Taramon Bibi the 
	award in a simple ceremony on December 19, 1995. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was Taramon's Godfather, Muhib Habildar, who motivated her to become a 
	freedom fighter. He was a solider who was on duty in a camp close to her 
	village. Taramon was about 13 or 14 when she joined the camp. At first, she 
	was brought to the camp mainly to do the cooking and cleaning, but later 
	when Muhib saw that she was a very strong and brave young lady he taught her 
	how to use arms like the rifle and stein gun. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Taramon recalls the first time she attacked the enemy with arms. She was 
	having lunch at the camp. Suddenly, the muktijoddhas came to know that a 
	gunboat carrying the Pak army was heading towards where they were located. 
	Taramon got prepared for combat with her comrades, and together, they 
	succeeded in getting rid of the enemy. After that, Taramon had to fight with 
	arms on many occasions. In fact, she has encountered the Pakistanis so many 
	times, that she lost count of the number. She said, she obeyed instructions 
	from her mentor and Godfather, Muhib. The muktijoddhas praised her for being 
	a good marksman. In those days, she never thought about the risks involved 
	in what she was doing. &quot;We were fighting to free our country,&quot; she says, &quot; 
	the last thing on my mind was worrying about my own safety.&quot; She was totally 
	committed to the cause of her motherland just like so many others at the 
	time. Taramon and her camp mates sought refuge in bunkers when the enemy 
	changed their tactic and started an air-bombing onslaught. The Pak army 
	raided the camp a few times and hurled bombs killing several people. But 
	fortunately, Taranmon escaped death. When the war was over Taramon came to 
	Dhaka with her Godfather. Muhib Habildar always used to inspire her. He 
	would say that they fought againts great odds, to gain independence. All the 
	hardship and sacrifice were for the cause of the motherland. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However Taramon has a complaint. The country has given recognition to 
	many freedom fighters and also provided a certain amount of financial 
	assistance to them. But she never received any kind of monetary benefit from 
	any of the governments till date. She feels that she was ignored because she 
	is a woman and people don't take women freedom fighters seriously. Taramon 
	lives with her farmer husband and two children in Kaliakoir, Comilla. </font> </p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Captain (Rtd.) Sitara Begum is the only other woman besides Taramon 
	Bibi to get the 'Bir Protik' award for gallantry in the Liberation War. Bir 
	Protik Sitara Begum was born in Kolkata in 1945. She is number three among 
	three sisters and two brothers. Her father Md. Israil Mian had a law 
	practice in Kidhoreganj where Sitara spent her childhood. After completing 
	her Matriculation, Sitara finished her intermediate from Holy Cross College 
	and then studied medicine at Dhaka Medical College hospital. When she 
	received her medical degree, she joined as a leutenant in the army's medical 
	corps in 1970. In the turbulent days of 1970, Sitara was posted in the 
	Comilla Cantonment. At the time, her brother, valiant freedom fighter Major 
	A. T. M Haidar was transferred to Comilla from Pakistan. He joined the 3rd 
	commando battalion in Comilla. Both Haidar and his sister Sitara went to 
	Kishoreganj to spend Eid holidays in February 1971. The non-cooperation 
	programme had started throughout the country by then. Sitara's vacation was 
	not over yet. Haidar warned Sitara not to go back to the Cantonment thus, 
	she returned home in Kishoreganj. Haidar sent some members of the 
	Muktibahini as well his parents and Sitara to Meghalaya, India. It took the 
	group almost two weeks to reach Meghalaya from Kishoreganj. There was a 
	makeshift hospital known as 'The Bangladesh Hospital', with almost 400 beds. 
	Captain Dr. Sitara was the Commanding Officer of the hospital under Sector 
	2. Among those who worked there were some final year students of the medical 
	college. Some doctors from UK also offered their services to the hospital. 
	Sitara had to go to Agartala regularly to get medicines. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The hospital had an Operation Theatre, the floor of which was covered by 
	plastic. The hospital not only catered to Bangali </font>
	<img height="115" hspace="7" src="image/rape_victim.jpg" width="191" align="right" vspace="7" border="1"><font face="Verdana">patients and wounded 
	freedom fighters, members of the Indian army also sought medical aid at that 
	medical centre. Sitara and her colleagues got to know about Bangladesh's 
	independence on December 16 through the radio. She returned to Dhaka a few 
	weeks later. But after her brother Major Haidar was killed in a conspiracy 
	in 1975, Dr. Sitara left Bangladesh her family and settled in America.

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Geeta Kar was only 15 during the War of Independence, yet she vividly 
	recalls what happened during those significant nine months. Her father was 
	killed on May 5, 1971 by the Pak army. Shocked by the incident, Geeta left 
	her home in Rajbari leaving behind her mother and younger siblings and 
	headed for India. They walked for nine days before they reached India. Geeta 
	was determined to fight to free her motherland from the ruthless grip of the 
	Pakistanis. When she was contemplating on joining the freedom movement, she 
	learnt about how Bangali people who have crossed the border and arrived in 
	our neighbouring country were getting organised to ward off the Pakistanis. 
	Geeta soon enlisted her name in the Mukti Bahini. She joined the camp on 
	July 2, 1971 and underwent training on guerilla warfare and first aid. There 
	were more than 200 women in the training group. Most of them had lost their 
	family members and were resolute to take revenge. The food they used to get 
	at the training camp was paltry but that didn't bother the camp inmates. 
	Geeta reminisces that the main driving force was the desire to win the 
	battle against the Pak army at any cost. After the training was over, it was 
	time to go to the actual battleground to utilise the skills. But only 15 
	young women including Geeta gave their consent to join the war. A guide was 
	sent with the group of novice, but he had could not communicate with them in 
	Bangla or English. To make things worse the guide disappeared without a word 
	one fine day abandoning the courageous young people who were ready to face 
	the enemy. But the determined group proceeded without their guide. They went 
	without proper meals for almost ten days and survived on banana and water. 
	Then somehow they managed to reach the Sylhet border. At first it was 
	difficult to convince the Indians of their true intentions. Finally, a man 
	named Makhon Shom from the refugee camp assured them all possible help. He 
	arranged for food and lit fire to keep them warm. Thanks to Makhon Shom's 
	kindness, Geeta and her fellow mates were able to reach Agartala. However, 
	when they arrived there, the women were not sent to the war zone as they 
	expected. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Instead, they were told to assist at the 480-bed hospital in Agartala 
	known as the Bangladesh Hospital. The group of young women put their heart 
	and soul into their job as medical attendants. Geeta remembers meeting 
	numerous freedom fighters at the hospital, and most of them were brought to 
	the hospital with serious injuries. She and her friends consoled themselves 
	in the knowledge that helping out at the hospital was almost as good as 
	fighting in the war. After all, both the tasks had the same goal. Geeta 
	returned to Bangladesh with the wounded Muktijoddhas and her friends at the 
	hospital five weeks after the Victory Day at the last week of January. They 
	returned to Dhaka after spending a week in Comilla. Most of her co-workers 
	had immediately returned to their homes when they reached Dhaka. But Geeta 
	didn't know where to go since her father was dead. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hena Das, the current President of the Bangladesh Mohila Porishad was the 
	Head Mistress of Narayanganj High School in 1971. Hena was an ardent member 
	of the Communist Party, Bangladesh Teachers' Committee and Bangladesh Mohila 
	Porishad.right from the start. Hena was in Kolkata during the war. On her 
	way to Kolkata, she delivered speeches in favour of Bangalis' fight for 
	freedom at the women's meetings there. Her main work was with the refugee 
	teachers. A Bangladesh Teachers' Committee was formed comprising teachers 
	from all levels in Kolkata. Fifty camp schools were set up with foreign 
	assistance and Hena was in charge of running the schools. She used to 
	explain to the children the reasons behind the Muktijuddho and also 
	motivated the teachers. Hena participated in collecting clothes and other 
	necessary items for the children in the refugee camps. Since the 
	Headquarters of the Communist Party was located in Kolkata, she was very 
	much part of the party's activities. Hena was constantly on the move until 
	May 1, 1971, at different places in Narayanganj, in the fear that she might 
	get caught. At one point, she took shelter in the science building with her 
	sick husband and five-year old daughter. There were some people who risked 
	their lives to keep in touch with her in those uncertain days. One of her 
	well-wishers was her teacher Nurul Amin, who was later brutally killed by 
	the Pak army. Hena was aggrieved by her teacher's death. But as Hena 
	recalls, she had to deal with the loss of many people who were close to her 
	in 1971, such as, the death of her student Momtaz, and the murder of the 
	parents of another student etc. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Liberation War has been an attractive subject for film makers and a 
	good number of documentary films have resulted from this interest. Being the 
	most powerful medium to hold people's attention, films have played a 
	significant role depicting the oral history of the Muktijuddho. But most of 
	these films have focused mainly on the freedom fighters, genocide and the 
	agony of people being driven out of their homeland. The incredible role of 
	women during the war and after, have not been given its due recognition. 
	During the war not only were women systematically sexually abused, they also 
	had to face the grief and shock of losing their loved ones, their homes. 
	With remarkable resilience and strength, women fought the war in so many 
	different ways. Two films -- one by Tareq and Catherine Masud called Narir 
	Kotha and the other by journalist Afsan Chowdhury called Tahader Juddho 
	together encompass the untold stories of women in the Liberation struggle, 
	one that continues even today. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Narir Kotha, a joint production of Audio Vision (Tareq and Catherine's 
	production company) with Ain O Shalish Kendra, a human rights organisation, 
	focuses on women who suffered immensely during the war. Victims of rape were 
	among the most traumatised. They not only had to endure the horror of sexual 
	abuse but also the pain of being humiliated and ostracised by society as 
	well as their own families. In the film, survivors of abuse by the Pak army 
	talk frankly about their ordeal and how they are still having to deal with 
	the stigma of being 'tainted' in the eyes of society. The 25-minute film 
	also includes interviews of women who survived massacres and lived to tell 
	their stories. It is clear that the film does not intend to make people 
	sorry for these women. Rather it is to demonstrate the incredible strength 
	and will to survive that needs to be recognised and respected. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even though the country won freedom 30 years ago, those who fought in the 
	war are still batling with poverty and hardship. Courtesy: Tahader Juddho
	</font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The underlying theme of Narir Kotha is 'the trauma and triumph of women 
	in '71' . It begins with footage of women engaged in various activities of 
	the Liberation War -- serving in hospitals, distributing clothes to victims. 
	The theme song says </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'No one talks about the role of women.' 
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Everyone sings the praises of men. 
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Didn't women folk contribute to the cause of Independence?' 
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The camera then focuses on renowned sculptor Ferdousi Priyabhashini who 
	survived sexual abuse at the hands of the Pak Army and their collaborators 
	in '71. As one of the first women to publicly speak of her ordeal she is 
	movingly honest and comes out as a person who has gone though the worst 
	nightmare but has managed to survive by channelising her pain into something 
	creative. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the interview she says that after independence of Bangladesh, she was 
	faced with another ordeal as her society refused to accept her. &quot;I became 
	the target of terrible insult and humiliation....At one point I realised I 
	don't need any human being in my life.&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was the very isolation that led Priyabhashini to take refuge in 
	sculpture. Using objects normally unappreciated and unwanted (like roots and 
	tree trunks) -- much like her own plight -she created sculptures. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;As I became engrossed in my own work, I withdrew from friends and 
	society,&quot; says Priyabhashini. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The next story the film narrates through the women survivors is about how 
	18 women of Kodalia village in Faridpur were massacred by the Pak Army on 
	May 1971. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabeya, now a middle aged woman, recounts how the village people hid in a 
	ditch in the jungle when they saw the Pak Army approaching. About 30 women 
	were in the ditch. Along with them were their children. Among them was Chanu 
	who was about 10 or 12 years old. &quot;The Army surrounded us and the 10-12 year 
	old boys like me...and took us away from our parents,&quot; says Chanu who had to 
	witness the murder of his mother, aunts and cousins on that terrible day. 
	The army caught the women and made them sit in front of a madrasa. They then 
	started firing on their hapless victims. Sufia, now an old woman was present 
	along with her daughter Hamida who was seven months pregnant at the time. 
	&quot;They set the machine guns and then brought water from the pond,&quot; recalls 
	Sufia. &quot;They said to us 'Do you Bangalis want to drink some water'?...I told 
	myself I wouldn't drink water from the kafir's hand.&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabeya describes how right after this the Army started firing: &quot;....women 
	fell like birds. Babies died in their mothers' laps.&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A few who were grazed by the bullets survived. Hamida, Sufia's pregnant 
	daughter, however, didn't. &quot;She asked her father for some water. After 
	drinking the water, she died,&quot; says Sufia, tears overflowing her eyes. Sufia 
	still bears the scar of a bullet in her stomach which had hit her during the 
	massacre. One of her daughters had later pulled it out. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Chanu's mother too was among the casualties. &quot;My mother was hit by six 
	bullets, she had fallen over on her stomach.&quot; Among those still alive were 
	Chanu's aunts, cousins and other relatives. They were still alive and 
	begging for water. Little Chanu ran to his house only to find it burning. So 
	he took a few coconut shells and filled them up with water from the pond. 
	&quot;Some of the women died while I was giving them water.&quot; The impact of seeing 
	so many of his relatives dying in front of his eyes was too much for Chanu 
	and he lost consciousness. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I don't think they were Muslims. How could Muslims kill others this way? 
	asks Rabeya relating how women alone in their houses were raped by the 
	soldiers. After this incident, says Rabeya, the men of the village joined 
	the resistance. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Smritirekha Biswas's story is next in the film. Smritirekha was only 12 
	in 1971 when the Pak Army burnt down her village forcing her and her family 
	to join the millions of refugees in an excruciating 13-day journey to the 
	border. Her family included her pregnant mother, her 80-year old grand 
	mother and younger brother and sister. For 13 days Smritirekha carried her 
	little brother Babu. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The country got freedom,&quot; says Smritirckha &quot;but we never got back what 
	we lost. So how can I say we benefited from independence?....we still 
	couldn't rebuild our house... The kind of communal harmony we had is no 
	longer there.&quot; The film then focuses on Adivasi women -- a group that played 
	a very active role in the '71 struggle, women who have never been recognized 
	for their courage. In a remote village in Rangpur, the film makers find a 
	few Adivasi women toiling in the paddy fields. It is characteristic of this 
	community for women to slog all day in the fields while their husbands 
	fritter away their wives' earnings in alcohol and gambling. Mazlibala, an 
	Adivasi woman, was a young woman who had been sexually abused by war 
	collaborators. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">She had just been married. One day some collaborators started following 
	her. Mazlibala hid in a small bush. &quot;They shouted at me, 'Don't move!',&quot; 
	says Mazlibala. &quot;I was trembling with fear, I couldn't run any more. When I 
	came home my father asked why I was crying. My father went to chase the 
	collaborators with bow and arrow.&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The next day her father sent her to her husband's house thinking she 
	would be safe. But again she was attacked. Her husband's grandfather hid her 
	under the bed and her sister-in-law under a mound of hay. &quot;At that point I 
	asked myself' &quot;Oh God is there no one in this world for me,&quot; says Mazlibala, 
	who is obviously still traumatised by the experience, &quot;What did I do to 
	deserve this?&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although she does not explicitly say that she was raped, it is obvious 
	from her emotional response that she was sexually abused. Later when 
	Mazlibala took refuge at her relative's house they asked why she was crying 
	all the time and whether the collaborators had dishonoured her. &quot;Is physical 
	dishonor all that matters?&quot; demands Mazlibala, her face washed with new 
	tears. &quot;Haven't I lost my honour anyway?&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Even to this day people ask me, 'Is it true something happened to you 
	back then?'&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;But how can I talk about that? What's the point of talking? If I speak 
	of it, it will only bring shame and dishonour to me.&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At this point another incident is referred to -- that of how Adivasi 
	(indigenous) men and women along with a few Bangalees attacked the Pak Army 
	in a courageous fight against the enemy. In April 1971, a large number of 
	Santals - men and women -- surrounded the Rangpur Cantonment. Armed with 
	bows and arrows the Adivasies attacked the soldiers. Their hatred of the 
	Cantonment was deep-rooted. Like Mazlibala, many other women had been 
	sexually assaulted by the Pak soldiers and their collaborators. The 
	proximity of the Cantonment to remote areas where many such Adviasi lived, 
	helped to perpetuate these sex crimes. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The men could not tolerate the Army's torture of their daughters,&quot; says 
	Nataniel Lakra, an Adivasi man in the film, &quot;Men, women, old and young we 
	all jumped into the fight...with whatever weapons we could gather, even 
	sticks.&quot; According to Lakra many of the Adivasi women fought with bows and 
	arrows and killed some of the soldiers.&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For women like Mazlibala, the fight goes on. &quot;We participated in the 
	Liberation struggle ...now we're struggling with our soil. Still our sorrow 
	doesn't leave us...The struggle will never end... </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There were many other women who actually took part in defending their 
	land or their families when the Pak Army attacked. The film turns to Choto 
	Paitkandi village where men and women together defended their village with 
	bamboo spears and shields. A mute woman tries to describe how the army came 
	and set fire to the village. She lost her speech after her husband was 
	killed while fighting the Pak Army. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A village woman informs that the soldiers killed the men and raped the 
	women. Another woman describes how her mother-in-law joined the fight with 
	bricks and stones and was shot dead by the Army. &quot;So many women died,&quot; she 
	says. &quot;Women tied grenades to their bodies and threw themselves on the 
	road.&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The whole village swooped on the soldiers and started beating them. The 
	soldiers then jumped into a lake. But the village folk jumped in and killed 
	them. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It's not only men who fought in the war, women did too. My mother-in-law 
	died in that fight, nobody talks about that.&quot; </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The film ends with the same song that reverberates throughout: 
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nine months of grief and pain </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Does the father have the only claim of parentage? 
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Have we forgotten the sacrifice of millions of mothers and sisters? 
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dramatic, without any contrivance, the stories in the film touch the 
	heart. While one shares the grief of these women who have lost so much at 
	the prime of their life, one cannot but feel inspired by their courage and 
	capacity to survive. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Produced and directed by Afsan Chowdhury, the film &quot;Tahader Katha&quot; (Their 
	War ) brilliantly captures the role women played in 1971. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tahader Juddho contains a series of interviews where the subject of the 
	film, the poor illiterate village women, describe their experiences of 1971. 
	We learn from these women who, at tremendous risk to themselves and their 
	families, surreptitiously delivered food to Muktijodhas, saved them from 
	watchful razakers by hiding them in their own house, provided them with 
	clothes, blankets etc, or smuggled arms from one place to another. But these 
	heroic acts and zealous patriotism of these poor women have not been 
	recorded in the history. Neither are they considered worth mentioning. With 
	our patriarchal mindset we are more comfortable to think of women only as 
	hapless war victims who at best can appeal to our sympathy but cannot 
	command our respect. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rokeya Begum was expecting a child when the war broke out. Her husband 
	used to bring his fellow freedom fighters home whom Rokeya used to feed. 
	This brought the wrath of the Razakars upon Rokeya. Following their threat 
	Rokeya decided to take food to the nearby island where the freedom fighters 
	had camped in. To make sure that she was not being followed by anyone Rokeya 
	used to get out at night and reach the island on a boat steering all by 
	herself. She also used to keep their weapons in the well of her house. 
	Sometimes the Muktijodhas spent nights in her house and on those nights 
	Rokeya kept vigil very often passing the whole night sleepless. &quot;People 
	talked a lot of things----I am a bad woman--------I go out alone at 
	night----------- chat with the muktis-----feed them. But fortunately my 
	husband always stood beside me&quot;, says Rokeya. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Farida Akhter of UBINIG, the feminist outfit who has worked to organize 
	women freedom fighter has strong views on the nature of gender 
	discrimination and war roles. She says of what women did in the war and how 
	it contrasts with male warrior pereceptions. Citing an example, she said of 
	a woman who had a little child, but taking food to the Muktijodhas occupied 
	her attention more than looking after her baby. One day, when she returned 
	home after feeding the fighters she found her child lying dead. A Pak army 
	soldier hat stood on the baby with his boots on had killed the child. But 
	she is not recognized for her role. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shohagpur Kakurkandi in Sherpur district. On one monsoon day in a matter 
	of just two hours almost all the men were killed by the Pakistani army and 
	their collaborators. It is called the &quot;widow's village&quot; now. 
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Kohinoor Begum had to flee from one place to another with her newborn 
	baby and a girl. One of her brothers went to the war while the other was too 
	severely beaten up by the razakars that he couldn't go to the work. Besides 
	her two children, Kohinoor also had three young sisters. Kohinoor had to 
	look after her all of them, which she did. She married off all of her three 
	sisters, raised her children and looked after her old bed-ridden mother who 
	later became mentally imbalanced due to shock. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As the film progresses and we hear more and more stories of these valiant 
	women who put everything at stake to win freedom for the country, we cannot 
	help comparing the lives of these forgotten women with those of male freedom 
	fighters, who have been recognized by the state and by their own communities 
	as real heroes, as Bir Srestho, Bir Bikram etc. As the film ends the 
	question, Chowdhury asks implicitly throughout the whole film also haunts 
	us: Weren't these women as much Muktijodha as the men who fought the 
	Pakistani army with guns? </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the most important role the women played besides taking active 
	participation in the war and helping the Muktijodhas in various ways was as 
	sustainers of families and households &quot;And it's on standing on these 
	households that society itself survived in 1971&quot;. says Afsan Chowdhury. For 
	these women it was a war of existence, a fierce struggle to survive which 
	did not end with the war. These remarkably courageous women have waged a 
	tough struggle to keep the family going on, raised their children and passed 
	on the spirit of fighting to them. Whether they find room in the pages of 
	history or not, it is an undeniable truth that it was their sacrifice and 
	strength that helped us to win our freedom. For these poor, ordinary village 
	women who had to fight simultaneous enemies on personal social and national 
	level, the fight goes on. </font> </p>
