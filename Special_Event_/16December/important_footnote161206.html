	<p class="style16 style73">Sven Lampell is a retired Swedish Air Force 
	Colonel who came to act as a Red Cross delegate to help out victims of the 
	1970 cyclone. He soon got involved in a cyclone of a different kind, a 
	man-made disaster that had outstripped even the cruelty of nature. He has 
	given an account of his stint in Bangladesh, rather what turned out to be 
	its gestation period, in a 1996 book in Swedish, titled Mitt i Stormen: Med 
	röda korset i fält. A free translation would be In the Middle of the Storm: 
	With the Red Cross on the Field. Shamsad Mortuza met Sven Lampell at his 
	residence in Stockholm in May 2006 to learn how he weathered the storm. And 
	the snippets of memory soon turned out to be interesting footnotes of our 
	liberation war, of which our contested history is rather blind.</p>
	<p class="style16">&quot;After a busy day, I was just about to recline in my 
	hotel room when the telephone rang. Instinctively I knew it was trouble. It 
	was from the Holy Family Hospital. They had received a call from an 
	orphanage in Dhanmondi; fourteen young girls had disappeared.” --Sven 
	Lampell was telling me of the day his Land Rover got shot at by machineguns 
	while trying to track down some missing girls. </p>

	countries in Asia and Africa as a Red Cross delegate. One of the chapters 
	recounts his stint in Bangladesh, rather what turned out to be its gestation 
	period. Lampell came to the then East Pakistan in 1970 to coordinate the

	</table>
	<p class="style16">Sven introduced us to his wife, Eva Dahlback, to whom he 
	has been married for nearly 70 years. Eva, still beautiful in her 
	naturalness, happened to be one of the leading Swedish actresses who 
	featured in six of Ingmar Bergman's films. She devoted herself to full time 
	writing and had quite a few novels to her credit. Eva excused herself 
	because of her illness as we settled ourselves in the sitting room that had 
	a large portrait of young Lampell, looking a bit like Rock Hudson I would 
	say. There were lots of books and souvenirs from different parts of the 
	globe, but not any sign of abundance or excess. Lampell took us by surprise, 
	pleasantly so, by offering us tea and pastry with a little flag of 
	Bangladesh stuck to the tea cosy. “A Bangladeshi friend of mine gave me 
	those flags.” We were touched by the simple yet thoughtful gesture. “That's 
	daddy's chair,” Lampell sunk into his armchair as we gathered around him to 
	hear about '71. </p>
	<p class="style16">I found Sven quite by accident. I don't think his name is 
	mentioned in our contested history of the liberation war. Yet Sven Lampell 
	played a significant part in hastening the resignation of the then governor 
	of East Pakistan, Dr A M Malik and his cabinet colleagues. We came to know 
	of him from Sven Stromberg, an ace journalist who covered the liberation war 
	for Swedish TV. Before coming to Sweden, the only Sven I had heard of was 
	the former English coach Sven Goran Eriksson; his Bangladeshi affair was 
	nothing to be proud of! But here in Stockholm, we met these two Svens who 
	were not only linked by their first names but also by their strange 
	connection to Bangladesh. Sven Stromberg came to Bangladesh Embassy in 
	Stockholm to get visas for himself and his adopted son. He told the 
	extraordinary story of his son Joy who was brought to Sweden by Lampell in a 
	shoebox. The First Secretary in the Bangladesh embassy in Sweden Shahnaz 
	Gazi, invited them both upon hearing their interesting snippet. The 
	octogenarian Lampell could not make it because he was not in a position to 
	leave his wife who was suffering from the Alzheimer's. He invited us at his 
	place instead.</p>
	<p class="style16">So there we were, at his house in Stockholm, listening to 
	some scintillating vignettes from a remarkable man. Born in 1920, Lampell 
	joined the Swedish Air Force and retired as a Colonel. His illustrious 
	career earned him the assignment in the Red Cross afterwards. He was one of 
	the pioneers to make the Air Pentathlon a regular event. He himself was part 
	of the champion team in 1954, 1956 and 1958. But this was nothing compared 
	to what we came to hear from the real man. </p>
	<p class="style16" align="center">
	<img height="363" src="image/cover03.jpg" width="550"><br>
	<span class="osdn-navtext">Photo credit: Star Archives</span></p>
	<p class="style16">We begin our conversation with the incident in which 
	Lampell went in search of fourteen young girls. It happened on December 16, 
	1971 after the official surrender of the Pakistani forces. These girls, aged 
	between 10 and 14, cajoled the Master of the Orphanage into letting them to 
	join the victory celebration. But the minivan in which they were travelling 
	came under attack, and the driver fainted after crushing the van against a 
	wall. When he came back to his senses, he, although heavily injured, somehow 
	managed to return to the orphanage; but he could not tell anything of the 
	girls. All he could give was an approximate location of the incident. </p>
	<p class="style16">All the Red Cross delegates were spread out in the 
	countryside. So Sven had to deal with it himself. He took his driver Haidar 
	and went to the orphanage to get some more information before heading for 
	the site of the accident which was actually very near to the orphanage. “I 
	saw the smashed up van. But the moment I got off the jeep, we were shot at. 
	I dropped down on the ground. It was rather dark and I somehow crawled to 
	the lakeside. There was no response from Haidar. I thought he was dead. I 
	stayed in the ditch for some time. There were quite a few rounds of shots. I 
	realised my white shirt was flashing like a target in the moonlight. So I 
	took it off and lied still half submerged in the ditch. There were millions 
	of mosquitoes and, believe me, it was not an easy job.” With his sharp and 
	clear voice, Sven transported us to a familiar part of Dhaka, but attached 
	it with an unfamiliar tale. </p>
	<p class="style16">“I lied there for a while. There were intermittent 
	gunshots. I crawled up to the van, and saw a girl lying under it. But we 
	could not communicate as she did not speak English. She somehow pointed to 
	the sliding door of the van which was open, where I noticed a dead girl 
	lying on the floor. I realised the dead girl was her sister, and she didn't 
	want to leave her. She pointed at a big gate just opposite to the van, and I 
	understood that the other girls were behind that gate.” There was an 
	imposing matter-of-factness in Sven's details that was driven by the 
	necessities of the given moment. No added sugar or spice. For example, he 
	did not say the girl was crying and so forth. It was plain and simple: they 
	had to brave the bullets and go to that house for the other girls. Because 
	of the moonlight and the snipers within range a straight crossing of the 
	road was not an option. So they waded through the lake, with Sven carrying 
	the dead girl in her arms and her sister holding on to his belt to reach a 
	shadowy part of the road. The snipers sensed the movement and kept on 
	shooting. Somehow they managed to get to the iron door, which was sensibly 
	left open by the owners of the house. There was an elderly couple who showed 
	them to the other girls.</p>
	<p class="style16" align="center">
	<img height="353" src="image/cover04.jpg" width="550"><br>
	<span class="osdn-navtext">Photo credit: Star Archives </span></p>
	<p class="style16">“It turned out that after the accident when the driver 
	lost consciousness, the girls took him to be dead and ran for shelter in 
	that house.” They cleaned up the dead girl and decided to return to the 
	orphanage. It was almost dawn, and they could not take the main road. So 
	Sven led the girls to a series of wall-climbing with a wooden box that he 
	borrowed from the first house to reach the road on the other side. “And 
	guess what! There was Haidar, waiting for us with an ambulance.” </p>
	<p class="style16">Sven told us while they were returning to the orphanage 
	they were stopped by two women, frantically crying for help. They followed 
	their direction and went to a house where a man was sitting on a chair with 
	blood oozing out from one of his eye sockets. Sven had to attend him as 
	well. “He did not seem like a fighting man. It was probably a stray bullet 
	that hit him. I put some bandages and took him to the hospital, where later 
	on he died.”</p>
	<p class="style16">After returning to the hotel, Sven told the Indian Army, 
	who were in charge of their security, of the attack. They went to the spot 
	and found that a group of Pakistani army men who were guarding the residence 
	of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had not been informed of the surrender. They were 
	still under instruction to shoot to kill as Begum Mujib and her daughter 
	(Shaikh Hasina) were still held as hostages. The Indian Army convinced them 
	that the war was over and made them surrender. “They found my Land Rover 
	with the engine still running.”</p>

	<p class="style16">It was probably just another night of action for Sven 
	Lampell. True to the title of his book, he was caught in the middle of the 
	storm. Just a couple of days before, he had played an unlikely part in 
	talking the governor of East Pakistan Dr. A.M. Malik into resignation as a 
	precondition to enter the neutral zone located in the then Inter Continental 
	Hotel. I give the full excerpt from the book, which had been translated from 
	Swedish to Bengali by Liakat Hossain. I believe this anecdote can be an 
	interesting footnote to our liberation history:</p>

	<p class="style16"><strong>December 12, 1971</strong><br>
	<em>I received a letter from the Governor of East Pakistan Dr Malik. He 
	wanted me to send a message to President Yahya in Islamabad expressing his 
	desire to negotiate with the Indians for a peaceful solution to the war. The 
	message was in defiance of the 'butcher of Bengal' Niazi's wish [who had 
	ordered to fight to the last man.]</em></p>
	<p class="style16"><em>Two days later I received another message from 
	Governor Dr Malik in while he, along with his other cabinet colleagues, 
	wanted to meet the person-in-charge of the 'neutral zone.' Legally I was the 
	only person to be in charge of the neutral zone. So I got on my Land Rover 
	(along with two more local Red Cross delegates.) Our driver Haidar drove us 
	along the deserted street. Suddenly there was an air raid, and we hid 
	ourselves in a park close to the governor's house. The building was damaged 
	by recent attacks. Some parts of the building were still on fire. No sooner 
	had we started for the governor's house again, there were fresh attacks on 
	the building. Again we were forced to take shelter, this time at a lake 
	nearby. </em></p>
	<p class="style16"><em>Nobody was guarding the main entrance. We walked in 
	without any hindrance. The governor's chamber had not been affected by the 
	attack. We entered the neatly decorated conference hall where the governor 
	was sitting along with his cabinet colleagues. These were the people who 
	were once radiant in their pride and authority, and who pulled all sorts of 
	bureaucratic strings to interfere in our day to day activities. It was hard 
	to believe that these people were of the same breed as the poor and 
	miserable ones that we were trying to help. The men sitting around the table 
	looked pale, exhausted, broken and uncertain. They had not heard anything 
	from President Yahya after their last message about a possible negotiation. 
	They could not wait anymore; they wanted to take refuge in the 'neutral 
	zone.' Their lives were in our hands. Fate was indeed having the last laugh. 
	I felt like an actor standing on the stage of a Greek tragedy. </em></p>
	<p class="style16"><em>I said that we need to talk over it. We went to the 
	corridor opposite to the conference hall where the heat of the smouldering 
	fire was still felt. Just like in a movie, I thought. Indeed we could not 
	just allow twelve members of a cabinet who were involved in the war to enter 
	the 'neutral zone.' Of course, their only other option was to ask assistance 
	of the Pakistan Army. But in that situation they would not have made it to 
	the airport;</em></p>

	<p class="style16"><em>the Muktis would have attacked. So there they were, 
	literally standing on the isthmus between life and death.</em></p>
	<p class="style16"><em>We decided that they could be taken into the 'neutral 
	zone' on condition that they officially resigned from their posts and 
	severed all links with the Pakistan government. Only as civilians they could 
	enter the 'neutral zone.' I made the proposition with deep apprehension. 
	Suddenly there was a pin drop silence in the room. Their faces were ashen. 
	After what seemed like a long pause, Dr Malik's voice was heard from a 
	distance. “I suppose we have no choice. Thank you.”</em></p>
	<p class="style16"><em>I produced my old writing pad. His hands were 
	trembling as he wrote the resignation letter addressed to President Yahya. 
	The letter was circulated around the table and everyone else signed it; some 
	did it in a heavy heart, some with tears in their eyes and some with 
	sarcastic laughter. In a matter of minutes, the cabinet was dissolved. Dr 
	Malik gave it back to me and said, “It all depends on President Yahya now!” 
	Just then another rocket hit the building, rocking the window panes.</em></p>
	<p class="style16"><em>Dr Malik and his colleagues were brought to the 
	'neutral zone.'</em></p>
	<p class="style16"><em>That afternoon I heard that Dr Malik was looking for 
	me. I went to the room where he was staying. He was standing on the corridor 
	with some of his family members. “So how does it feel to be inside the safe 
	zone?” I enquired. Instead of replying he just forwarded a piece of paper. 
	It was the reply from President Yahya that he was waiting for. Dr Malik had 
	been authorised to negotiate with the Indians “to take all necessary 
	measures to stop the fighting.” It was a little too late. Had it reached Dr 
	Malik a couple of hours ago, Dr Malik would have not resigned. But by then 
	he had been stripped of all his authority. (My English translation) </em>
	</p>
	<p class="style16"><span class="style74">T</span>he translator Liakat 
	Hossain, an expatriate Bangladeshi settled in Sweden, told me that the 
	documented history makes no reference of Sven Lampell in connection with the 
	surrender. One source said that Dr Malik surrendered to foreign journalists 
	and another mentioned the UN officials. But the references are vague and 
	lack credentials. One Indian newspaper published on the following day, 
	however, reported that Dr Malik had resigned and handed himself to the Red 
	Cross. According to Liakat, if Sven had not talked Malik into resignation, 
	General Niazi would have tried to delay the surrender and unleashed more 
	havoc like that of the killing of the intellectuals on December 14. I tend 
	to agree with Liakat.</p>
	<p class="style16">Immediately after Sven had taken the cabinet members in 
	the neutral zone as civilians, he felt obligated to tell the Muktis of his 
	move. There were waiters at the Inter Continental Hotel who were acting as 
	informants. They would usually come up and say “Is there anything else that 
	you need?” That was the password for making connections with the Muktis. 
	Then Sven would be assigned with a pathfinder, usually a young boy or a 
	girl. It was never the same person and the Muktis were constantly shifting 
	their head-quarters. So Sven went on to meet the sub-commander and explained 
	why he had to give shelter to Dr Malik and others. He seemed to appreciate 
	his position, but there were some dissenters among the Muktis. They 
	threatened us with attacking the 'neutral zone,' if the 'traitors' were not 
	handed over. But with the Indian Army taking control of things, the attack 
	never took place. Sven also complimented the Indian Army for being very 
	professional. “The Indian Army was there for two months as the occupying 
	force, and there was not a single incident of rape or looting. As a former 
	military man, I must say this is a laudable record by any count.” Sven also 
	spoke highly of the new government, excepting the way they handled the 
	stranded Biharis. “They never allowed us to deal with the Biharis. 'Give us 
	what you want to give to them,' was their answer. But one thing I know: if 
	you give it to the government, it will never get to the people who needed it 
	the most.” Sven was shocked to learn that the issue had not yet been solved.

	proffered a very reflective opinion, “It was unbelievable. How could be 
	people full of such hatred! It was a civil war of its worst kind. Anyone 
	with a sane mind would know that it was a dead issue from day one; thousands 
	of miles in between, totally different cultures the idea of Pakistan as a 
	single state was never going to work. But after 32 years in the Red Cross, I 
	must say, I don't have any high hopes in human kind, especially in war. 
	Anything that you can ever imagine can happen.” He recalled the killing of 
	the intellectuals just before the ultimate victory, “It was a ghastly sight 
	I was there.” There was a silence that needed no translation.</p>
	<p class="style16">I wanted to end the conversation with something happy. So 
	I asked him about Joy, the adopted son of Sven Stromberg. Joy was found by a 
	Red Cross ambulance mission in a house somewhere in Old Dhaka after an air 
	raid. Both of his parents were dead in the attack, and the newborn was 
	brought to Holy Family Hospital where he became everybody's darling. Sven 
	Stromberg was on the first helicopter of the Indian Army that came to 
	arrange the surrender ceremony. While interviewing his fellow Swede, 
	Stromberg expressed his willingness to adopt a child. He went to the Holy 
	Family Hospital where he saw Joy, and “it was love at first sight.” It was 
	up to Lampell then to bring the child though. He told me how he prepared the 
	passport for Joy with the help of a German delegate (because the newly 
	established Bangladeshi officials had more serious things to concentrate 
	on); how he bribed the airport authority and carried the child in a shoebox 
	all the way to Geneva, how he had to tackle the suspicious Swiss police, how 
	he did not get the protocol assistance that he was supposed to get because 
	of a delayed flight, how he had to withstand the battle-cry of baby Joy, and 
	the list goes on. The flight attendants of Lufthansa gave Lampell a proper 
	baby basket, but he decided to keep the paper box as a memento. In fact, 
	when they arrived in Sweden the whole Swedish media was there and the child 
	was handed over to his adopted parents in the shoebox. “He was named 
	Nicholas Moses Joy: Nicholas because he was found on the Christmas Eve 
	(after St. Nicholas), Moses because of the way he was found, and Joy comes 
	from Joy Bangla as well as the joy of having the child.” </p>
	<p class="style16">So there we were with the story of a dead girl, a fallen 
	government, and a rescued boy. And there we were with an unsung friend of 
	Bangladesh, both humbled and enriched by his experience. For Sven Lampell, 
	the Red Cross was not just a job. He served it with passion and love for 
	humanity. He has allotted a special place for Bangladesh in the corner of 
	his heart, but have we? Is it too much to ask that we reciprocate the 
	feeling that Sven Lampell harbours for us? I am sure Sven Lampell is one of 
	the many friends we have in different parts of the world. One only hopes 
	that these friends of Bangladesh are recognised before it is too late.</p>
