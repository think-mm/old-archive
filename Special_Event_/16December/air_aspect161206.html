		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Air power played 
		a pivotal role in the final phase of the Bangladesh Liberation War. For 
		the first time the people of Bangladesh came face to face with the 
		awesome power of the air force and the way it could shape the destiny of 
		a nation. For most people in Bangladesh, war in the air was a unique 
		experience. There are important lessons to be learnt from these air 
		operations that are relevant for our future military planning. Although 
		by September 71, the nucleus of the Bangladesh Air Force was raised in 
		Dimapore, Assam with a number of small transport aircraft and 
		helicopters; it could not have significantly influenced the outcome of 
		war. This article will, therefore, be limited to the air operations of 
		the Indian and Pakistani air forces in the East. </font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>The 
		Opposing Forces</strong><br>
		In March 1971, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in the East consisted of a 
		squadron of F-86E (No.14 Squadron) fighters operating from Tejgaon. The 
		airfield complex was defended by light anti-aircraft guns; there were no 
		surface to air missiles. The plans to make Kurmitola airfield 
		operational and raise another squadron with the Chinese F-6 fighters 
		remained unimplemented. Since 26 March 1971, the PAF fighters had been 
		attacking suspected Mukti Bahini (Freedom Fighters) strongholds, causing 
		large-scale civilian casualties. During this period, the No.14 Squadron 
		flew between 100 and 170 combat sorties a month. However, while the 
		Army's strength was bolstered four times by December 71, the air force 
		strength reduced. The second fighter squadron never arrived; by October 
		71, the only available long range radar was removed from Kurmitola to 
		Pakistan; and by the end of November, the only C-130 transport plane was 
		also withdrawn. It appeared that the Pak air force and army high 
		commands were at cross-purpose.</font></p>

		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Facing the PAF 
		in the East was the Eastern Air Command (EAC) of the Indian Air Force 
		(IAF). The Headquarters of the EAC was located in Shillong, Meghalaya. 
		The squadron deployment is shown Table-1. <br>
		The PAF was not only facing a force 12 times larger, the entire 
		population of Bangladesh had turned hostile towards them. This acted as 
		a tremendous psychological pressure. As the summer rain ceased and 
		winter set in, the prospect of an all out war between India and Pakistan 
		became real.</font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>The 
		First Blood</strong><br>
		The first air combat in the East took place on 22 November '71. The PAF 
		had flown a number of missions on that morning in support of the army 
		who were engaged in fierce clashes with the joint India-Mukti Bahini 
		forces along the Jessore border. The morning missions went ahead 
		unopposed. Then at about 3-00 PM when three PAF F-86s were attacking the 
		ground forces, they were pounced by four Gnats (No.22 Sqn) scrambled 
		from Dumdum. Two of the F-86s were shot down within minutes; both the 
		pilots ejected and were taken prisoner in India. It was apparent that 
		without radar cover the F-86s were easy prey to the attacking Gnats who 
		were directed by IAF radars at Barrackpore. Since that day till the end 
		of the war, the PAF did not venture beyond 50 nm of Dhaka. </font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>IAF 
		Counter air Operations</strong><br>
		There was no air action till mid-night of 3-4 December when the IAF 
		launched counter attack in retaliation to the PAF preemptive against 
		their airfields in the Western sector. Canberra bombers kept attacking 
		Tejgaon in waves till morning when the fighters the Hunters, Su-7 and 
		MiG-21s, took over. The F-86, being a day fighter, could not operate at 
		night. However, as the day broke, they went up repeatedly to challenge 
		the IAF fighters. People of Dhaka witnessed thrilling low-level dogfight 
		throughout 4 and 5 December. The IAF concentrated in attacking the 
		aircraft on the ground, but failed to cause significant damage to the 
		PAF assets in well-dispersed and camouflaged locations. During these two 
		days of air combat, three PAF fighters were shot down; all three pilots 
		ejected two over Ghazipur and the third over Zinjira. While the Zinjira 
		pilot could be rescued, the other two were listed as 'missing'. After 
		the war, it was revealed that they were killed by hostile villagers. It 
		was a testimony to the anger the Pak forces had generated among 
		otherwise placid villagers.</font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The IAF too 
		suffered significant loss on the Day-, they lost one Su-7 and six 
		Hunters. While three fighters were shot down in air combat, the others 
		were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. Three IAF pilots were killed, two 
		were taken prisoner and two others managed to reach back to base. By the 
		evening of 5 December, the IAF realised that a change of tactic was 
		necessary. On the morning of 6 December, four MiG-21s (No. 28 Sqn) from 
		Gauhati dive-bombed Tejgaon runway scoring several hits. Since then, 
		waves of MiG-21s and Hunters kept attacking the runway and cratered it 
		so badly that the PAF in the East was effectively grounded. By the next 
		day, Kurmitola airfield was also bombed and made unusable. The IAF thus 
		achieved complete mastery of the air. </font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
		Operations in Support of Ground Forces</strong><br>
		The IAF could now concentrate in supporting their advancing army. 
		Movements of Pakistani troops during day time came to a virtual halt due 
		to relentless IAF air attack. Ferries across major river crossings were 
		sunk by the IAF thus denying the Pak army its line of retreat to Dhaka. 
		Meanwhile, the IAF fighters kept on visiting Dhaka during the day to 
		ensure that the damaged runway at Tejgaon and Kurmitola remained 
		inoperative. The IAF also bombed other airfields, including the 
		abandoned WWII airfields such as in Comilla, Lalmonirhat and Shamsher 
		Nagar to deny their use by any external aerial reinforcement. From 7 
		December onward, INS Vikrant, Indian Navy's aircraft career, joined the 
		war by attacking the coastal targets of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and 
		Barisal. Whatever remained of the Pakistan Navy was destroyed or sunk. 
		The airfields in Cox's Bazar, Chiringa and Feni were made inoperative.</font></p>

		rocket attack on 14 December, 1971</span></font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Airborne 
		and Heliborne Operations</strong><br>
		On 11 December, a Para battalion was dropped in daylight near Tangail. 
		The unit, flown in by waves of IAF transport aircraft, such as An-12, 
		C-119 and DC-3 Dakotas were in full view of those on the ground. Instead 
		of hostile groundfire which usually greets the descending paratroopers, 
		the Indians were virtually mobbed by the populace, wild with jubilation. 
		Next day, further reinforcement and re-supply were flown in. The Paras 
		had cut-off the rear line of Pak Army units in Jamalpur-Mymensingh axis. 
		The Pakistani retreat soon turned into a rout.</font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Meanwhile, the 
		helicopter fleet of the IAF played key role in two major operations. 
		First, on 7 December a battalion of infantry was helilifted to the 
		outskirts of Sylhet. These forces captured Sylhet virtually without a 
		fight. The Pakistani forces scattered in disarray. Then on 10 December, 
		while the Pak Army were in their dug-in position around Bhairab-Ashuganj 
		area, elements of the Indian heliborne forces were transported by Mi-4 
		helicopters across the river Meghna and dropped in Narshingdi-Raipura 
		area cutting the Pak Army's line of retreat. In the next 36 hours, over 
		110 sorties were flown. The Mi-4, which normally carried fourteen 
		troops, carried as many as twenty-three on board. After securing 
		Narshingdi, Indian forces captured Daudkandi and Baidder Bazar on 14 and 
		15 December respectively, both with helicopter assault. The skyline of 
		Dhaka was soon visible in the distance. </font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Air 
		Power in Psychological Warfare</strong><br>
		With the PAF effectively grounded in the East, the Canberra bombers and 
		some fighter squadrons were withdrawn to the Western theatre. IAF 
		transport aircraft were pressed to fly over Dhaka at night at high 
		altitude and drop bombs around the cantonment area at irregular 
		intervals. These attacks were putting psychological pressure on the 
		Pakistanis. Because as the lumbering aircraft kept circling overhead, 
		the Pakistani forces were having sleepless nights worrying where the 
		next bomb would land. Although most bombs fell in the cantonment area, 
		on 5 December night, one bomb landed on an orphanage in Tejgaon area 
		killing a large number of children. Other than this incident, civilian 
		population was generally safe from collateral damage, so common in an 
		air war. </font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<img height="213" src="../../Articles/ishfaq/vic16.jpg" width="500"></font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Early on 14 
		December, the IAF got a message through the Mukti Bahini that an 
		important meeting was scheduled in the Governor House (now 'Banga 
		Bhaban') that morning. Four MiG-21s of No. 28 Sqn from Gauhati were 
		tasked to attack the Governor House. As Dr. Malek, the puppet Governor 
		of the then East Pakistan, along with his cabinet and high officials 
		were in session, the MiGs came screaming down and accurately fired 
		salvos of rockets into the Darbar Hall. The Governor was so traumatised 
		that he resigned then and there, and rushed to the Hotel 
		Intercontinental (now Sheraton), to seek shelter under the UN Flag. The 
		Pakistani civil administration in the East ceased to exist. Of and on, 
		between 12-14 December, the IAF transport planes came over Dhaka and 
		dropped leaflets urging the Pak forces to surrender. As the leaflets 
		were floating down, the morale of the Pakistanis were sinking fast.</font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Epilogue</strong><br>
		By 15 December, at the request of the Pakistani Commander in the East, 
		all air operations ceased and the negotiation for the surrender of the 
		Pak forces started. On 16 December morning, the IAF helicopter carrying 
		the Indian negotiating team landed in Tejgaon. Thus the combat air 
		operations ended in the East. As the preparation for the surrender was 
		going on, the PAF damaged or destroyed on ground the remaining thirteen 
		F-86s as a part of the denial operations. (Later, three of these 
		aircraft were repaired and flown by the Bangladesh Air Force for some 
		time.)</font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Lessons 
		Learnt </strong><br>
		Most important lesson that came out was the reaffirmation of the old 
		edict, Control of the air hastens victory. If the PAF had not been 
		knocked out so early, the war would have dragged on longer. The Para 
		drop in Tangail or the heli-hops across the mighty rivers in daylight 
		would not be possible if there was air opposition. The Pak army was well 
		dug-in for a long encounter. With the US and China backing Pakistan so 
		strongly in the UN, and the 7th Fleet steaming into the Bay of Bengal, 
		there was a serious danger of a stalemate or an international 
		conflagration. With the quick and decisive end of the war such an 
		eventuality was averted. </font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The air 
		operations once again proved that an army or navy without air power is 
		sitting ducks. The destruction of the ferries, attacking the army 
		columns on the move and disrupting the communication systems by the IAF 
		totally immobilised the Pak army. The army was reduced to tiny packets; 
		they could not regroup or retreat. Combined air and naval operations 
		ensured that the Pak forces could not get any assistance from outside 
		nor could they extricate themselves from Bangladesh. There was no way 
		but to surrender. </font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<img height="371" src="../../Articles/ishfaq/vic19.jpg" width="500"><br>
		<span class="style12">PIA aircraft destroyed on Tejgaon Tarmac, 4 
		December, 1971</span></font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This war shows 
		that it is very important NOT to have all your eggs in one basket. If 
		the PAF had more than one airfield with multiple runways, the F-86s 
		would not be grounded so early. Also, if the PAF had a number of radars, 
		especially covering the forward areas, their operations would not be so 
		curtailed. The need for a mixed air defence system composed of fighters, 
		anti-aircraft guns and missiles supported by a robust command and 
		control system was once again emphasised. It was also apparent that 
		assets, if camouflaged and dispersed, could be difficult to destroy as 
		was evident in Tejgaon. The IAF air operations went off like a symphony 
		with the right notes striking at the right time. Compared to more than 
		1100 missions flown during the 14 day war, the 19 aircraft lost, 
		including 6 due to accident, speaks of a high standard of training.
		</font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The war showed 
		the versatility of the helicopter and air transport forces and how, if 
		used intelligently, those assets could change the face of the battle. 
		The need for intelligence and their dissemination to the users, 
		accurately and in time, was also emphasized. </font></p>
		<p class="style11" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The war revealed 
		the all important need of public support behind military operations. 
		While Pakistani pilots ejecting over Bangladesh were killed by the local 
		people, the Indians were safely transported back to their bases. These 
		must have acted as a great demoralising factor for the Pakistanis. 
		Unlike the Pakistani top brass who were often at cross-purpose, the 
		Indian military leadership was clear in their aim and objective and the 
		means to achieve those. Once the task was assigned and the military was 
		provided with the wherewithal to accomplish the mission, there were 
		little political or bureaucratic interference. In the future military 
		planning for Bangladesh these lessons will always remain relevant.</font></p>
