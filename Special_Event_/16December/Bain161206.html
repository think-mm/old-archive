	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">This is to narrate some memories of June, 1971.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In 1971, I was an SSC candidate, who could not 
	appear at the examination that was supposed to have taken place in the month 
	of April. Of course, the examination could not happen due to the beginning 
	of the struggle of Bangladesh to get out of the Pakistani military brutality 
	in the land. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">My high school was called Gimadanga Tungipara High 
	School, named after two villages near my maternal uncles’ home. I used to 
	stay at my uncles’ home at a village called Baladanga, one of three villages 
	named after the Bala clan. Baladanga was also called Tungipara by many, as 
	it was a little village next to Tungipara, just across the river Baghiar.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I was born in a village about 4 miles from Tungipara. 
	It is called Dumaria. It is on the bank of the river Shailadaha. At the west 
	end of my village, the Baghiar and the Shailadaha merge, and with in just a 
	mile, the combined flow meets the river Madhumati. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In June, 1971, I was at my maternal uncles’ home 
	when the Pakistani military came in their gun-boats from the Madhumati. They 
	went north-east on the Shailadaha toward Kotalipara, and north-west on the 
	Baghiar toward Tungipara. The whole area was, and still is, inhabited mostly 
	by Hindus. The brute forces of Pakistan used what I now think were 
	flame-throwers to burn all the Hindu villages along the river. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">From my uncles’ home in Baladanga, we fled into the 
	swamp area away from the river bank. We could see village after village 
	burning on both banks of the rivers. Most people from all the villages fled 
	into the swamp areas away from the rivers. The military men stayed mostly in 
	their gun-boats, firing flames at houses and bullets at people that they 
	could see. On some higher grounds on the banks of the rivers they 
	disembarked, and looked for people to kill. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">My primary school teacher, Mr. Narayan Chandra 
	Biswas, fled from the village and took shelter in a little island house in 
	the swamp area. The military men spotted him from their gun-boat and fired 
	their guns. Mr. Biswas was a direct hit. He died on the spot, with little or 
	no last minute touch of love from his near and dear ones. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Mr. Biswas was our Bangla teacher. He was particular 
	about the children reading and writing Bangla words and sentences correctly. 
	He would not allow his students to talk like the average illiterate person; 
	our pronunciations had to be correct. His perfectionist teaching of the 
	language was behind the future academic excellences of many of his students.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I do not call Mr. Biswas a martyr. He did not even 
	shout a slogan against the Pakistani ruling class, let alone fighting with 
	arms and ammunitions. He was a regular good and honorable person, and an 
	extraordinary teacher. He did not intend to give his life for anything like 
	the creation of Bangladesh. He just wanted to live as an innocent person in 
	his motherland. Of course, the Pakistani military killed him because he was 
	born in a Hindu family, and because like most other people he did not give 
	up his inherited religion to convert to a Muslim. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">On that day of July 1971, several men of the 
	Pakistani military disembarked at our big family compound; our house was 
	known as the Baro Bain Bari (the big Bain house). Two of my aunts, about 
	sixty years old, were hiding in the jute field. The military men spotted 
	them. These ladies were a bit more religious, Krishna devotees. They were 
	quite frail. They had pictures of Krishna with them. The military men came 
	near them, and asked something in Urdu, which neither them nor the other 
	hiding people that could hear them understood. But the ladies just showed 
	the brutes the pictures of Krishna, and told them something like “we are 
	poor innocent people, we do not know anything about politics, we just spend 
	our time praying to this lord of ours.” They were shot point blank. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">These ladies were by no means martyrs. They were 
	just absolutely innocent people with no sense of politics. They certainly 
	had no hatred towards anyone, including the Pakistani brutes. They were 
	victims of hatred in the minds of the Pakistani Islamic fanatic political 
	and military forces. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The Pakistani military burned all the Hindu 
	dwellings that they could handle on that day. They came the next day to do 
	some more of the same. The targets of their hatred were people who were by 
	no means political activists. Those people were regular hardworking innocent 
	peasants, making a simple living in their homeland, with no hatred against 
	any class of people in the world, including the Pakistanis. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In the two days, the only Muslim house that was 
	burned was Sheikh Mujib’s rural home in Tungipara, no other house in that or 
	any other Muslim village. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">At the Sheikh residence, they ordered the parents of 
	Mujib to get out of the house. They were rude to the elderly Sheikh couple. 
	Their rudeness was protested by a man, who was actually an uncle of Mujib. 
	He was a lower-class Sheikh, a child of a big Sheikh and his maid. His 
	protests against the mistreatment of the Mujib-parents earned him a terrible 
	and torturous death in the hands of the Pakistani beasts. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">May be, this man deserved to be called a martyr.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The people and the ruling class of Bangladesh have 
	proven to be without much sense of honor. Martyrs or not, the people of East 
	Bengal that were killed, raped and tortured by the Pakistani military were 
	our people. The cause of their victimization was nothing but hated against 
	us from a hate-mongering feudal and military ruling class. If we forget 
	them, if we do not care about justice for them, if we do not care about 
	punishing the criminals, we are really dishonoring ourselves. Unfortunately, 
	over the last thirty five years, we have been doing just that, dishonoring 
	ourselves.</font></p>
