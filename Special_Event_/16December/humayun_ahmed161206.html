	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">They arrived just before evening. An enormous group. 
	Not marching or anything. Just walking about in a disorganized manner. They 
	were probably coming from very far away. Each of them bowed down in 
	weariness. Faces wet with sweat. Khaki clothes gray 'with dust. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Almost all of the villagers went into hiding. Only 
	Crazy Bodi came forward with a smile. With enormous glee he shouted at them, 
	&quot;What's up?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The whole group stopped suddenly. Crazy Bodi held a 
	red gamchha in his hand. Waving the red gamchha like a banner, he shouted. 
	&quot;Where you going, eh?&quot; He had never seen such a strange sight before. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major was wearing sunglasses. He took his 
	glasses off and asked in English, &quot;What is this man saying?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Ranquddin replied immediately, &quot;The man seems to be 
	a madman. All our villages have one of them.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Oh really?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;How can you tell that this man is mad?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Rafiquddin stayed silent. The major had a very 
	twisted sort of nature. He could squeeze out ten different meanings from a 
	single sentence. Crazy Bodi could be seen running towards them. His face was 
	all smiles. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Rafiq snapped at him. &quot;What the hell do you want?&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Crazy Bodi's smile broadened further. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Rafiq wiped the sweat off his forehead. He said in a 
	thin voice, &quot;The man is mad, Sir. All our villages....&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;You've said that once before. There is no need to 
	repeat the same thing two or three times.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Rafiq gulped. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major said in a cold voice, &quot;I like this place- 
	Let us rest a while. Everyone's tired.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Sir, if we go on five miles further, we'll reach 
	Nabinagar. It's a big marketplace, there's a police station there. We should 
	get to Nabinagar before evening falls.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Why? Are you afraid?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Of course not. Sir. Why should I be afraid?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major turned towards the group and said 
	something- A soft hubbub arose. Within moments everyone was sitting down, 
	sprawling here and there. They began removing their helmets. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major said in a low voice, &quot;We have to tie the 
	madman up.&quot; He sat down on a wooden box and lit his pipe. Pipes don't 
	usually go with someone wearing khakis. But this major was impossibly 
	handsome- Anything looked good between his lips. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The madman was tied to a mango tree. He did not 
	protest. Rather, he seemed quite happy to be fortunate enough to be allowed 
	to stay near these people. No one paid much attention to him- They were 
	terribly tired. Their gazes were vacant and without thought. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major drank a few gulps of water from his water 
	bottle. He took off his boots. He had a blister on his left ankle. </font>
	</p>

	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Rafiq said, &quot;Would you like to have a green coconut. 
	Sir?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major said in a calm voice, without answering 
	his question, &quot;In the past, whenever we entered a village, there would 
	always be a small group with a Pakistani flag in hand to welcome us. They no 
	longer come. Do you know the reason for this?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I don't know, Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;They don't come because they are afraid. All the 
	people of this village are now hiding in the jungle. Am I right?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Rafiq did not answer. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Crazy Bodi said, &quot;I feel like drinking some bottle 
	water.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;What does he want?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;He wants to drink water from the canteen, Sir.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Even though all the villagers had fled, Aziz Master 
	had been unable to because his sister had arrived from Ghonapota. Her labour 
	pains had started that morning. One cannot drag around a person in such a 
	condition. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Still, Aziz Master had said twice, &quot;If we could 
	somehow get her to the boat, then she could be taken to Shyamganj.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">In response, Aziz Masters mother had made an ugly 
	remark concerning his cowardice. She compared him to a cat with a broken 
	leg. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master did not protest because it was true. He 
	was an awful coward. Ever since he had heard that the army had entered the 
	village, he had been feeling the need to piss pretty frequently. He was 
	sitting in the yard, and he started violently at the least bit: of noise.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Master, you home?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Who's that?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">A few Nilganj elders entered the yard in an 
	apprehensive manner. &quot;You should be goin' there. Master.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Where should I be going?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Instead of answering the question, Dabir Mia said in 
	a low voice, &quot;Who else c'n go other than you? You know English. You know how 
	to speak proper.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;You asking me to go to the military?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Yeah.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;What could I do there?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;You could go and tell them that we have no trouble 
	in this village- Take the Pakistani flag with you,. There's nothing to be 
	afraid of.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master did not speak for a long time. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Dabir Mia felt irritated and said, &quot;Why don't you 
	speak?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;How can I go? We've such trouble at home. Puti is 
	havin' a baby -&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;There's nothin' you c'n do here. Master. You're 
	neither a doctor nor a kaviraj.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master said in a faint voice, &quot;Where do I get a 
	Pakistani flag?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Why, whatve you done with the school flag?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Threw it away.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Threw it away? What for?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master did not answer. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Dabir Mta said in an angry voice, &quot;Even if you have 
	passed yo IA exams, Master, you still don't have much brain. What made you 
	throw away the flag? Now what else can you do? Then, go on, empty-handed.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I'm afraid, Uncle.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;There's nothing to fear. These are neither tigers 
	nor bears. You just go and be nice to them, say nice things. Its a matter of 
	a minute or so. What do you think, Azmat?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Quite right.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Don't delay. Go before it gets dark.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Alone?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Its better to go alone. Go by yourself. Recite the 
	Kulhu Allah your mind three times and place your right foot forward first. 
	Say Yaa Muqaddemu silently mind five times. There is nothing to fe Master. 
	This is Allah's sacred text. It has special and sacn significance.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master remained sitting there with his head 
	bowed dow He felt the need to urinate again. Puri was whimpering inside tl 
	house. This was her first pregnancy and she was suffering. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;How can I leave my sister in such a state?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;What sort of talk is that? What can you do at home? 
	Always talkin' like an idiot- Get up now.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master got up. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major stared at him for a long time through 
	narrow eyes. It was getting dark. The statement on his face was hard to 
	read. He was sitting on a large wooden bench with his legs spread wide 
	apart. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major asked in clear Bangia, &quot;Ki chaw ? &quot; (&quot;What 
	do you want?&quot;) </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master was taken aback. This guy knows Bangia? 
	How strange! </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Ki chaw&quot; ? </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Well, I don't really want anything.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major said, in English this time, &quot;If you don't 
	want anything, why are you here then? To watch the fun? This is circus?&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master started to sweat. The rest of the 
	conversation was carried on in English on the major's side- Aziz Master 
	answered in Bangla. It didn't create any problems. The major understood 
	Bangla. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;What do you do?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I am the Primary School teacher here.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;So there's a school here?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;What else is there?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;There's a mosque.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Only a mosque. No temples? Where pujas are held?&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;No, Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Tell me the truth. Is there a temple here or not?&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;No, Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major lit his pipe. He said something in a cold 
	voice to someone in Punjabi or some other language- The man came over and 
	slapped Aziz Master hard on his cheek- Aziz Master fell over on his back.
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Tied to the mango tree. Crazy Bodi said in surprise, 
	&quot;Oh Master, get up then, get up.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major asked as if nothing had happened, &quot;What is 
	your is your name?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Azizur Rahman.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Azizur Rahman, do you have freedom fighters here?&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;No.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Everyone's Pakistani?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Yes.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Well, that's good. You yourself are a pure 
	Pakistani, right?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Yes. Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">If you're all Pakistanis, then what are you afraid 
	of? It seems to me that all the villagers have fled in fear. The women are 
	all hiding in the jungle. Am I right?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master did not answer. His head was reeling. He 
	was feeling nauseous. With great difficulty, he controlled his urge to 
	vomit. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Do you think that we will take your women away?&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master remained silent. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Why aren't you speaking? Is your wife also hiding 
	in the jungle?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Sir, I am not married.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Not married? How old are you?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Forty.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Forty and not yet married? How do you cope then? Do 
	you masturbate?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master wiped the sweat off his forehead. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major roared, &quot;Answer me.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Raflquddin said in a thin voice, &quot;Sir wants to know 
	whether you masturbate. Answer him, man. Sir is getting angry.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I don't.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Really? Is your equipment okay? Let's see, take 
	your pajamas off and show everyone.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;What are you saying. Sir?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I told you to take your pajamas off and show your 
	equipment to everyone. Well, hurry up, don't delay. I don't have much time.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master looked at Rafiq in surprise. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Raflquddin said in an indistinct voice, &quot;Take it 
	off, man. What's there to be ashamed of among men? Take if off. Sir is 
	getting angry.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major said something in a low voice. Someone 
	came and jerked down Aziz Master's pajamas. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major said, &quot;Take his shirt off too.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master tried to cover his nakedness with his 
	two hands. The soft hum of laughter arose around him. Someone threw a ball 
	of crushed paper at him. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major said, &quot;Do you love Pakistanis?&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I love them.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Good, do you love the Pakistani army?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Very good. You must love me too. Don't you? Go on, 
	tell me,&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;I love you, Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;You love the man who is forcing you to stand here 
	naked? You seem to be a lover of the whole world.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">A flood of laughter erupted as the major made some 
	remark in a low voice. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">With eyes big in amazement, Crazy Bodi said, 
	&quot;Master, where're your clothes? Hey, Master.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master looked at him with muddied eyes. His 
	nausea had gone, leaving him with an intense and sharp pain at the back of 
	his head. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The major said, &quot;Azizur Rahman, you are lying out of 
	fear. To save your life. Tell me the truth, and I will let you go. Do you 
	like me?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;No.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Now we're getting the truth. Do you want this to 
	become Bangladesh?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Yes, Sir.&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;So, you're a traitor. Traitors should be put to 
	death- That is what I would like to do. Or do you want to live?&quot; </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Aziz Master did not answer. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Don't delay. Tell me if you want to live.&quot; </font>
	</p>
