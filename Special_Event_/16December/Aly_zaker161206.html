  <b><font face="Verdana" color="#6FB1D9">Published
	on
	December 16, 2006</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify">I<font face="Verdana"> am writing this piece on our 
	Victory day. I know that by the time it will be printed the day will have 
	come and gone. But does it really matter? This day still holds the same 
	place in our hearts as it used to thirty-five years ago. Of all days of our 
	national significance, this is the one that I remember and revere most. When 
	the occupation army of Pakistan came down upon the Bangalis in Dhaka on the 
	night of the 25th and the morning of the 26th of March 1971, and when the 
	independence of Bangladesh was proclaimed, we were too shaken; indeed 
	devastated to have taken notice of what was going on. The &quot;operation search 
	light&quot;, was a wanton act of brutality unleashed by the enemy to maim and 
	overcome an entire nation. We were busy saving our lives. Verily, all of us 
	were solidly behind our leaders but little did we know about the kind of 
	reprisal it would warrant. I remember fleeing my beloved city of Dhaka, 
	tears welling up in my eyes. Not out of fear but from the pain of having to 
	leave behind all those memories that are associated with this city. My 
	school days, the days in the college or the University, and the friends that 
	I made in the journey to my youth. I was crying because I saw, as if in an 
	apparition, the Bangla signs of the shops in the New Elephant road and the 
	New Market being lowered down and Urdu signs hoisted in their place. I could 
	not possibly have even dreamt of living in a city subjugated and captivated 
	by a foreign force. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today was another day. It was almost 
	the end of an ordeal. I was in a place near Navaron in Jessore with a tape 
	recorder in hand. This was an assignment from the Swadhin Bangla Betar. I 
	was recording reactions of the local people as they were progressively 
	becoming free. In the process I was also falling in the footsteps of the 
	advancing Mukti Bahini and the Indian army. It was a rather cold December 
	day. The sun was already going down in the western horizon. I was aware of 
	the fact that Dhaka was already surrounded by the Bangladesh and Indian 
	forces and would fall any time. A call for prayer by the muazzin heralded 
	the evening. The day of the 16th of December was coming to an end. Suddenly, 
	I saw an army jeep coming from the opposite direction. I was a bit surprised 
	to see it. Because it was the time to go forward, not to turn back. When the 
	jeep came close by some one stuck his head out and said, &quot;Rejoice! The 
	Pakistanis have surrendered&quot;, and then it sped away. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For about a minute I was dumb 
	founded. I did not expect it to happen so soon. I was apprehending the worst 
	thing to follow if the Pakistanis did not surrender. An artillery barrage 
	created by the joint liberation forces could have completely decimated the 
	city of Dhaka. Many of my friends and relatives were still there in the 
	city. And I was naturally very concerned. But right then the foremost 
	thought that pervaded me is the fact that we were FREE. I remember placing 
	the tape recorder on the ground. Looking up to the sky, now infested with 
	stars, and cry in silence for a minute. Then, on that road to Jessore, now 
	bereft of traffic, quiet and peace ful I cried out with all the strength I 
	could muster, WE ARE FREE! I kissed the soil of Bangladesh and rolled on its 
	bosom like a man possessed. I rolled and rolled until fatigue took me over. 
	This was the fatigue of nine months of uncertainty, of desperation, of hope 
	and anguish. I started walking back towards the border, stray thoughts 
	crowding my mind. I saw in my mind’s eye Rustom running towards a Pakistani 
	bunker with a live grenade in hand and jumping in to it giving the last 
	battle cry of ‘Joy Bangla’. He killed himself and all those that were 
	occupying the bunker. I saw the face of my dear Kamol da who sacrificed one 
	of his eyes so that we could be free. I remembered Hafiz and Mahboob, 
	Ashfaque and Rumi and millions of others whose valour and blood mingled with 
	this soil to give our posterity and us a nation of our own. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is impossible to give vent to my 
	feelings of that day and to give an account of how people rejoiced this 
	victory that day or afterwards within the confines of this column. The day 
	we were returning by road back to Dhaka I was a witness of how people from 
	villages spontaneously and exuberantly engaged themselves in rebuilding 
	roads, repairing bridges or offering food and water to the people. This was 
	a spirit of camaraderie of selflessness that we could not hold on to for 
	long. Yet this is the only spirit that could have removed all our miseries 
	of toady. Could we go back to those days, re-live the spirits of the Victory 
	day of '71 and start it all over again? May be we would find a sense of 
	direction from there. Otherwise, we'd fail to build a viable nation for our 
	posterity. And that is devastating, even to think of. </font></p>
