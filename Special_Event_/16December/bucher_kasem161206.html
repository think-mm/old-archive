	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1971, I was a final year civil 
	engineering student at EPUET (now BUET). We were about to graduate when the 
	political turmoil in East Pakistan just got started. As we were preparing 
	for our final examination, when suddenly, the university was closed due to 
	the unrest all around us. This recount I am about to tell, would bring into 
	the fore one more time the inhuman butchery and atrocities committed by the 
	Pakistan army as I witnessed with my own eyes. This had been the most 
	horrific experiences of my life and to put it mildly this had a profound 
	impact on my views on religion and politics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the eve of 25th March, 1971, I 
	was staying at Shere-e- Bangla Hall of EPUET. Just a few days before that 
	the political problems engulfed East Pakistan as General Yahya steadfastly 
	refused to accept the mandate of the people of East Pakistan for full 
	autonomy. The students were on strike. Actually, it was the exam time and I 
	was preparing for my final year examination as I said it before. However, 
	due to the political unrest, the examination was withheld and many students 
	had left the residential halls and went back home. I was, though, actively 
	involved in student politics. Therefore, I decided to stay put in the hall 
	so that should a need arises I shall be available to join the movement. A 
	few days before the 25th March there were persistent rumours in the air that 
	the talk between Mujib and General Yahya was not progressing well and that 
	there was that possibility of a military crackdown looming over the horizon. 
	However, the government media cleverly played down this rumour by insisting 
	that the talks were fruitful. Some newspapers even suggested that General 
	Yahya was prepared to hand over the power to a civilian government where 
	both Bhutto and Mujib will have major roles. With those types of misleading 
	information many people thought that at last the Bangalees will have a 
	chance to taste their freedom after a sojourn of about thirteen years. But 
	that did not happen. On the fateful night of 25th March,1971, the Pakistan 
	army came out from the cantonment with fury to teach the Bangalees a lesson 
	of their lifetime that they will never forget. And surely they did. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is my very personal recount of 
	the nights and days on and immediately after March 25,1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I went to bed a bit early at around 
	9.00 at night. I was quite tired for the whole day and quickly I fell into 
	my sleep. Suddenly at around 11.00 P.M, my deep slumber was disturbed by a 
	the noise of a constant barrage of gunfire. At first, I thought that it must 
	be the firecracker's by Bangalees to celebrate the victory. But soon I 
	realised my mistake. I opened the window. It was very dark. Not even the dim 
	streetlights were burning. But there I could barely see numerous military 
	vehicles moving around with soldiers with theirs automatic rifles. 
	Occasionally, I could see very bright searchlights mounted on some of the 
	military trucks and jeeps. Many soldiers were running and shooting in the 
	street. I saw a large convoy of military vehicles had surrounded the whole 
	of the EPUET area. As far as my eyes could go, I could see military men all 
	around the campus. I could even hear the army people talking loud in Urdu 
	downstairs in our hall. I immediately knew what was going on. I thanked my 
	lucky star that I switched off the room light before I went to bed. There 
	was deafening noise from the machine gun and automatic rifles, which were 
	not too far from where I stood. I just could not believe what was going on. 
	I was alone in the room; there was nobody to comfort me on that fateful 
	night. Being panic-struck, I started trembling and fell down on my bed.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then, all on a sudden a hail of 
	bullet shattered the nearby window. The bullets hit the ceiling and walls 
	and then hit the floor. A thought passed through my mind. I knew I was going 
	to die. Without thinking much I went under my bed as a protection against 
	hitting by stray bullets. I lied on my chest and grabbed the floor as if 
	that was my life. The firing continued incessantly for almost the whole 
	night. Then suddenly there was a lull. No machine gun or rifle sound. I 
	thought it was over. So I slowly came out from my hiding place and sat on my 
	bed. I looked at my wristwatch. I could not see very well. It was 3.00 A.M 
	or so, I guessed. Suddenly, there was an extremely loud noise and the whole 
	area was brightly lit. I could not resist the curiosity. Through the 
	shattered window pane what I saw was utterly unbelievable. I saw a military 
	tank throwing fire on the slums (Bastee). The slum was just next to our 
	halls and along the old railway track. I saw people running out of their 
	hovels. As the slum dwellers came out to escape the fire, the Pakistani 
	soldiers started to shoot them with a machine-gun that was mounted on a 
	military truck. I could see only one truck with the machine gun near our 
	hall. But I am sure there were many more on other sides as I could see the 
	fires from these machine-guns dropping like August showers in the darkness 
	of the spring night. It was a seen I have watched only in TV and movies on 
	Vietnam wars. I could hear the desperate cry for help from those hapless 
	victims. I closed the window as I thought that one of those bullets would be 
	enough for me. I sat on the floor and suddenly realised that this is it. 
	There was no escape for me. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Time passed and slowly the morning 
	broke the silence of the eerie night. I could still see the military people 
	from my window. I switched on my transistor radio on a very low volume to 
	hear what was going on. The Dhaka Radio Station was dead. I switched to 
	Calcutta . There was no mention of East Pakistan except that General Yahya 
	Khan had left Dhaka after the final talks with Mujib. So I switched to 
	Karachi. Now I got the news that I wanted to hear so desperately. There was 
	a special announcement that General Yahya was going to speak to the nation. 
	I heard him speaking. It was the voice of a heavily drunken person that one 
	can tell. I cannot recall all that he said. But there were few words that I 
	still remember to the letters. These words were &quot;Mujib's act is an act of 
	treason. He will not go unpunished.&quot; Yahya Khan ended by saying that Mujib 
	will be tried by a special military tribunal. The news announced that Sheik 
	Mujibur Rahman along with Dr. Kamal Hussain had been arrested and taken to 
	West Pakistan for the trial. I also heard Bhutto saying that &quot;Thank God. 
	Pakistan was saved.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the meanwhile the fire in the 
	slum continued and I noticed a strange odor in the air. It took me sometime 
	to figure out that it was indeed the smell of burning flesh. I did not hear 
	any fire brigade siren or anything like that although there was a fire 
	brigade office just next to our hall in Palashi. It was almost 8 oclock in 
	the morning and the fire slowly started to diminish after devouring the 
	nearby shantytown. From my window I could see the tank moving out from our 
	area. I again lied on my bed and started to search other radio stations for 
	news. Suddenly, I heard mild knocking on my door. I froze. I felt that my 
	blood circulation had suddenly stopped. In front of my eyes I saw nothing 
	but white colour. I could not move from my bed. I just lay still. After a 
	while there was another knock. Now it stroke my mind that if it was the army 
	they will not wait for my response. They would simply burst open my door and 
	start shooting. There must be some one else, I guessed. So, I went near the 
	window close to the door and looked. I saw Monju, my next door neighbour 
	crawling on his chest near my door. I gingerly opened a little of the door 
	and asked him what was wrong. He whispered to me that something was wrong 
	with his roommate, Ashraf. Monju asked me to follow him to his room. I 
	opened the door silently and slowly crawled on my chest to Monju's room. I 
	found Ashraf lying on the floor with eyes wide open but his mouth shut and 
	he was vigorously shivering. There was water all over. I asked Monju why was 
	there so much of water on the floor. Monju replied that it was not water. It 
	was Ashraf's urine. He told me that Ashraf had urinated several times and 
	now he (Ashraf) cannot talk. I called Ashraf very softly. He just stared at 
	me but could not say anything. I knew what had happened. Ashraf had a 
	nervous breakdown. I told Monju that we keep whispering to him that the 
	military is gone and we are safe. Surprisingly, after whispering for about 
	15 to 20 minutes Ashraf started to murmur a few words. After a while he 
	simply whispered, &quot;Please, please, do not leave me.&quot; I told Ashraf that what 
	ever happens the three of us will remain together. If we die we shall die 
	together. This assurance from us made Ashraf slowly come back to normal. All 
	of us were very hungry and thirsty. So we ate the stale bread and some 
	water. Then we talked how each of us passed the dreaded night. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was around midday and we found 
	that all the military personnel had left our area. There was no sound of 
	gunfire, no sound of military trucks or vehicles. In fact, there was an 
	eerie unbearable silence all around the campus. No bus, no rickshaw, no car, 
	hardly any people on the streets. We thought that it was our best 
	opportunity to escape from the hall. We tuned to AIR and heard about the 
	indefinite curfew in Dhaka. But we decided to escape no matter what happens 
	even if that meant breaking the curfew and being shot at by the military. We 
	decided that I shall go to Monjus apartment at Azimpur Government quarters. 
	Both Monju and Ashraf used to live at Azimpur quarters. I crawled back to my 
	room, put on my shoes and grab my transistor radio. The three of us then 
	slowly started to climb down the stairs hiding ourselves as much as we 
	could. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We went to the ground floor. To our 
	disappointment we found the entry/exit gate was locked. The guards had 
	locked the gate and fled. Later on, we realised that that action by the hall 
	guards actually had saved our lives. In frustration, we came back to our 
	room on the second floor. Then we decided to go to 1st floor and jump from 
	the balcony/verandah. At first, we thought of leaving the radios behind. 
	Then we realised that the radio was the only means by which we could know 
	what was going on in East Pakistan. The three of us then jumped in the 
	garden. Luckily, the jump was a success. Then we quickly ran. While running 
	across the hall compound we saw the gruesome scenes of killing by the 
	Pakistani army. In Liaquat Hall (I suppose it is Titumeer Hall now, but Im 
	not sure) we saw plenty of blood and a dead body possibly the guard's. 
	(Later, I learnt that four students were killed at Liaquat Hall.) We quickly 
	ran to the Fire Brigade Centre in Palashi. The Centre was very close to our 
	residential Hall. We thought of taking temporary refuge in Fire Brigade 
	building before proceeding to Azimpur colony. There was a small mosque 
	inside the Fire Brigade compound. I saw four dead bodies there. All were 
	riddled with numerous bullet holes. The floor of the mosque was flooded with 
	blood. I thought that some Fire Brigade people tried to take shelter in the 
	mosque hoping that Pakistanis will not commit murder in a place of worship. 
	But how wrong they were! We saw many other dead bodies on the compound of 
	the Fire Brigade. Some dead bodies were inside the Fire Brigade trucks and 
	ambulance. They took shelter inside these vehicles hoping to escape the 
	onslaught. Most likely none of the Fire Brigade people survived. Then we 
	arrived at the road that separates the Azimpur Colony from the Palashi. On 
	the road we found many dead bodies scattered everywhere mainly of rickshaw 
	pullers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There was a high wall at the entry 
	of the Azimpur Colony. We did not know what to do at that point. The curfew 
	was on and if any army people saw us they surely will kill us. We had no 
	choice but to jump over the wall. To our utter surprise we could jump over 
	the wall and fell on the other side of the wall. I still do not know how I 
	did that. May be our adrenaline was running high after all that happened to 
	us. I am sure that if I have to jump that wall again, I shall surely fail.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After jumping inside the Azimpur 
	colony we felt a little safer and we all heaved a great sigh of relief. 
	Monju suggested that I go and stay with him. Ashraf was too nervous to say 
	anything. So, firstly we escorted Ashraf to his quarter and then Monju and I 
	headed towards Monju's quarter. When Monjus father and mother saw us they 
	simply hold us tight and started crying. We quickly went inside the bedroom 
	and told our story. Monjus father said that they were certain that 
	Pakistani army had killed us as he had witnessed the army operation from the 
	window. We realised how lucky we really were to be alive that fateful night. 
	Monjus mother prepared some food for us. We were extremely hungry. I 
	finished all the food served to me. During this time we did not hear much 
	gun shots in the local area of Azimpur. But we could hear the non-stop 
	machine gun firing in the distance. We carefully opened a little bit of the 
	window. All we saw was smoke and fire all around, a little away from 
	Azimpur. We guessed that it was old Dhaka area possibly near the Buriganga 
	river and Sadarghat. After the liberation, it was found that the killing and 
	destruction done by the Pak military was one of the worst in the old Dhaka 
	area. They have killed virtually each and every person in the Hindu 
	dominated Shankari Patti in the Old Dhaka. The fire and smoke was so 
	terrible that at night the whole sky was red. In the evening we ate some 
	food and we tried to sleep. But none of us could hardly shut our eyelids. 
	The whole night we searched the world on radio. At last we got the news from 
	BBC of what was going on in East Pakistan. The Dhaka radio station was 
	working again only playing mainly Urdu patriotic songs and Islamic verses. 
	We were now sure that our dream of a free nation had suddenly vanished. The 
	Pakistani army had captured us as slaves. The whole night we mostly talked 
	about what would happen to the Bangalees since all our struggle was in vain. 
	Finally, the morning came. At around 9 oclock we heard in Dhaka radio that 
	the curfew had been relaxed for six hours only. We found many people on the 
	street. I suggested to Monju that I better go home and see if my family 
	members were alive. As our house was in Nakhalpara (very close to cantonment 
	and the airport), Monju, his father and mother were very reluctant that I 
	should take the risk. However, after my constant insistence they let me go, 
	but reminded me to return immediately to them if I had problem. Until today, 
	I can never repay their debt. You can tell they were really so concerned 
	about me. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, I came open in the street. I 
	found people and people all around me. No bus, no truck. Hardly any rickshaw 
	plying the street. There were occasional cars and military vehicles with 
	fierce looking soldiers and machine gun mounted trucks and jeeps. I asked 
	some people where were they headed to. Most of them replied that they did 
	not know. They simply wanted to leave the city and go to villages where they 
	felt they would be safe. Many of them headed towards Sadarghat hoping that 
	they could catch a steamer or a launch to go to villages. I also did not 
	know what to do. Since there were no transport it would be very difficult 
	for me to walk all the way to Nakhalpara. I thought of going back to Monju's 
	place. Then I changed my mind when I found that thousands of people are 
	walking, many of them bare footed and with nothing but their clothes on. So, 
	I also started walking. Whatever happens to these people will also happen to 
	me, I thought. The first place I came was Iqbal Hall (now Sergeant Zahurul 
	Hall?). The scene I saw in Iqbal Hall was beyond any description, I swear! 
	The whole area was like a battlefield. I knew that DUCSU VP Tofail Ahmed 
	used to live there. There were holes on the walls created by mortar shells. 
	Those holes were visible from afar. When I arrived at the playground of the 
	Hall, I saw about 30 dead bodies all lined up for display to the public. 
	Many of the dead bodies were beyond any recognition due to innumerable 
	bullet holes on their faces. That was a gruesome sight. Many people started 
	crying. My friend Jafar used to live in Iqbal hall. I did not see his dead 
	body. Later, I learnt that his dead body was found in his bed. Needless to 
	say, the displayed corpses were merely a small fraction of the students that 
	Pak army had murdered in Iqbal Hall on that dreadful night. They simply 
	displayed a few corpses to frighten and to break the morale of all 
	Bangalees. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Anyway, I had to hurry along. I 
	started to walk again and came to the central Shaheed Minar. I saw the 
	entire Shaheed Minar was nothing but a heap of rubble. Many people could not 
	believe what they saw. The army had totally destroyed the Shaheed Minar by 
	using powerful explosives, I guessed. Amongst all the cruelties inflicted on 
	the Bangalees that night, I think the destruction of the central Shaheed 
	Minar was the cruelest of all. I noticed some blood on the smooth and shiny 
	floor of Shaheed Minar. But I did not see any dead body. May be the Pak army 
	decided to remove the corpses from the street area so that their movement 
	wont be affected. I really cried when I saw the Shaheed Minar. Even the 
	displayed corpses at Iqbal Hall could not bring tears to my eyes and make me 
	cry. But I could not hold my tears when I saw the corpse of the Shaheed 
	Minar. The shock was much too much for me. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I started to walk again and came to 
	Jagannath Hall. The entire Jagannath Hall compound was like another 
	battlefield. I saw the footprints of tractor vehicles. There were huge holes 
	on the walls of the Jagannath Hall. I guessed that the army had used tanks 
	in Jagannath Hall. In front of the Jagannath Hall lawn I saw a huge mass 
	grave. The grave was so fresh and shallow that we could see some half buried 
	corpse. Some hands and feet protruding from under the soil due to the 
	consolidation of soil, I guess. It was a grotesque scene, to put it mildly. 
	I do not know how many people were buried there. Judging from the size of 
	the grave, my guess was at least a few hundreds. After the liberation of 
	Bangladesh many of us have seen the video footage of this brutality of the 
	Pak army. The video was taken secretly by a brave EPUET (now BUET) professor 
	from the window of his apartment </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By the side of Jagannath hall there 
	was a small narrow road. On the side of this road and on behind the back of 
	Rokeya Hall there were a large number of washermen (dhopa) who used to live 
	in small quarters with their families. Their number could be around 50 or 
	more. I found that Pak army had burnt down the entire area. I could see the 
	charred bodies of children and adults still in the burnt bed. On the side of 
	the dhopa quarter and by the side of the road, I saw another freshly dug 
	shallow mass grave. I could see the feet and hands of children and adults 
	sticking out from the grave trying to tell the entire world what did happen 
	to them. All people who passed by saw this terrible sight and shook their 
	heads in utter disbelief. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After a long and tiring walk, I came 
	to Shahbag Hotel (now IPGMR). The building (hotel) was intact. I looked at 
	Dhaka Radio Station. No sign of devastation. Although, there was heavy 
	military guards including tanks and armoured vehicles around the radio 
	station. There was no damage to Inter-Continental Hotel (now Sheraton 
	Dhaka). Then I came to the office of the daily newspaper 'The People. My 
	friend Obaid was a sub-editor with the 'People. Naturally I went to find 
	his whereabouts. What I saw was disbelieving. The entire office of the 
	'People' along with a few more shop houses was burnt to ashes. The place was 
	still smoldering. When I went a little closer. I saw many dead bodies burnt 
	like charcoal. They were absolutely unrecognisable. Only the shape says that 
	they were human. The area was filled with the smell of burnt flesh (like 
	barbecue smell). I do not know the fate of Obaid. But until today I never 
	heard anything about him. So I assume that he was burnt alive in that 
	inferno. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I came out from the ruins of the 
	'People. As I was walking past the fashionable Sakura Restaurant (I am not 
	sure if the restaurant is still in business or not) a car suddenly stopped 
	near me. I was astonished to see my father, mother, and sisters all inside 
	the car. My mother and sisters were weeping. My father asked me to get 
	inside the car. My mother simply hugged me and started to cry loudly. I 
	asked my father what had happened. My father said they were simply fortunate 
	to be alive. Then he told me that we were all going to Dhanmondi to stay 
	with our grandfather. My mother told me that she never expected to see me 
	again as they heard that the army had killed each and every student in the 
	residential halls. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Soon we arrived at my grand father's 
	house. My grandfather was simply happy to see us alive. We ate some food. 
	Then my mother narrated their fateful night of the 25th March. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So this was how it happened at our 
	home on March 25, 1971. The recount was based on what I did hear from my 
	mother. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Round about midnight everyone in our 
	house woke up with noises of heavy vehicles, people marching on boots, loud 
	shouting, bright lights and some more gunfire. At first they erroneously 
	believed that it must be a victory celebration. That was because just before 
	every one went to sleep, there were rumours that Yahya Khan had agreed to 
	transfer power to Mujib. However, when my folks opened the window they 
	couldnt believe what they saw. It was shocking to see that the entire 
	Nakhalpara area had been cordoned off by armoured military trucks. The 
	soldiers with rifles and machine guns were running all over the place. Also, 
	there were very bright searchlights all around. My family also noticed jeeps 
	mounted with machine guns very close to our house. Naturally everyone was 
	frightened. Being nervous my mother started praying without loosing any 
	time. A few minutes later they heard a loud banging in our front door. They 
	were at loss not knowing what to do. My father picked up the courage and 
	opened the entrance door. Four soldiers with pointed rifle immediately 
	entered our lounge. They asked everyone to line up in the lounge. So, my 
	father, my younger brother, my brother in-law, my four sisters, nephew and 
	niece and my mother all obliged by lining up in the crammed space. All of 
	them were shivering in hot March night. Then one of the soldiers separated 
	the males from the females. The males were ordered to remain in the lounge. 
	All the females including my mother were ordered in the bedroom nearby. At 
	that stage my mother started crying and fell down on the knees of the 
	soldiers for their mercy. The soldiers simply dragged her to the bedroom. 
	One soldier guarded the males while the other guarded the female quarter. 
	The two other soldiers then started ransacking each and every item in every 
	room including the food in the kitchen. They even examined the newspapers 
	and other documents even though they did not understand a single word of 
	Bangla. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the soldiers then found the 
	shotgun that my father had always had with him. I have seen that shot gun 
	since my birth. It was licensed and completely legal. I have seen my father 
	going for hunting with his favourite shotgun every once in a while when time 
	permits. The soldier who found the shotgun came immediately to the male 
	captives. He demanded to know whose shotgun was that. My father calmly 
	replied in broken Urdu that he was the lawful owner of the gun. The soldier 
	then pointed his automatic rifle at my father and ordered him to follow him 
	downstairs. My father knew that he had only a few minutes to live. At that 
	stage my younger brother stood between the rifle and my father and requested 
	the soldier that he wants to accompany my father. The soldier became furious 
	at the insolence shown by my brother. The soldier threw my brother on the 
	floor and started pushing my father with his rifle towards the exit door. My 
	father then requested the soldier to look at the license of the shotgun. But 
	alas, the soldier could neither read nor understand the English language. So 
	the soldier said that he had to call his officer. Another army man was 
	called to guard while he went outside looking the for the officer. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After about fifteen minutes the 
	soldier returned with the officer. My father was not sure what was the rank 
	of the officer. Thank God! The officer was not as brute as the lower ranking 
	jawan. The officer showed little bit of courtesy for my elderly father. He 
	asked my father to take a seat so that he could examine the document. After 
	a thorough examination the officer then asked my father why he had not 
	surrendered his weapon to police station. My father replied that there was 
	no directive to that effect. The officer then rebuked my father for being so 
	stupid to keep the weapon in the house when there were so many miscreants in 
	the area. My father agreed with him and asked for his forgiveness. The 
	officer then said that my father's life will be spared but they will have to 
	confiscate the shotgun. Then he started interrogating every one on various 
	matters including our religion and political affiliation. My father became 
	the spokesman. He answered what the army men wanted to hear. That we are all 
	Muslims and we have no connection with the Awami League or any pro-freedom 
	party etc., etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The officer then asked my father how 
	many sons he had. My father replied two. He inquired about the whereabouts 
	of his sons. My younger brother identified himself. He told the officer that 
	he had finished his HSC and waiting to go to EPUET (now BUET). The officer 
	then asked my father about me. My father replied that I was about to 
	graduate from EPUET. The army officer then demanded to know why I was not at 
	home. At that point my father could guess the real reason these army people 
	are barging into our home. He carefully said that I was very studious and I 
	preferred to study with my friends. So I did not come home for a few days. 
	The army officer then started to note down all the details about me and told 
	my father that as soon as I returned home he (my father) must contact him 
	through telephone. I was simply lucky that my father did not disclose the 
	University residential hall that I was staying. The officer then warned my 
	father not to leave our house as they may come to investigate again. My 
	father said no problem. Throughout this ordeal, my brother-in-law did not 
	talk much because he was actively involved in NAP politics! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the interrogation of the male 
	members was complete the officer then entered the bedroom to view his female 
	captives. Needless to say, my mother feared what might happen to her 
	daughters. My eldest sister was a schoolteacher. My next two sisters were 
	college going and only my youngest sister was still in her childhood. My 
	mother was so hysterical that she kneeled down to the two soldiers and 
	begged them that whatever they wanted to do let them take her daughters out 
	of her sight. The soldiers were simply laughing and taunting my mother and 
	sister with abusive language and accusing them of being pro Awami League. 
	They told my sisters that very soon they would take them to cantonment. At 
	that stage my eldest sister picked up some courage and told them in pidgin 
	(in broken) Urdu that they cannot simply do that without a warrant of 
	arrest. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The soldiers laughed heartily 
	hearing the response from my sister and said that they were not police. They 
	were army and they could do whatever they wanted. Luckily, at that point the 
	army officer entered the bedroom. My sister asked the army officer why they 
	were being harassed. The officer told my sister that he had information that 
	there were many miscreants in our area. Their duty was to catch these 
	miscreants and take them to cantonment for punishment. He then told my 
	sister that he had found us very gentle, polite and cooperative and so he 
	will let all of us go free this time. But he wanted to let everyone know 
	that they will come again. At last he showed some respect to my mother by 
	apologising to her and saying good bye to her in chost Urdu. But before the 
	officer departed he whispered something to his recruits. The two soldiers 
	then forced my elder sister to open the steel Almirah (Safety box) . They 
	took all the money and the jewelry that were there for safekeeping. Thus, in 
	a hurry we lost most of our valuables. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After almost 36 hours the curfew was 
	lifted for 6 hours. My family members heard the wailing sound of bereavement 
	all around the area. The Pakistan army had taken many people from Nakhalpara 
	area to cantonment that night. Most of those taken were young students. It 
	was a sheer miracle that my family members were spared. None were taken to 
	the cantonment. It is not known how many of those unfortunate people lost 
	their lives because until today their whereabouts are not known. Be that as 
	it may, most of them never returned home. All the residents of Nakhalpara 
	realised that the area was absolutely unsafe to stay. Therefore, most 
	residents left Nakhalpara almost barefooted with only the clothes they were 
	wearing. My family also followed the suit. They also left Nakhalpara 
	immediately after the curfew was lifted. From grapevine we heard that 
	Dhanmondi was a safe area. So we went to our grandpa's house over there in 
	to seek refuge and secrecy. A few days later we heard the dreadful news from 
	Chittagong. Two of my uncles were killed in Agrabad Railway colony in a 
	military operation similar to the one the army did in Nakhalpara operation. 
	The army call those &quot;Mop Up Operation.&quot; To us, the Bangalees those operation 
	was akin to serving the death notice or something similar to that. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After few weeks my younger brother 
	secretly ventured to Nakhalpara to see in his own eyes the condition of our 
	homestead. To his horror he found that everything including a bag of rice 
	had been removed or stolen. So we became destitute right away. But that did 
	hardly dampened our spirit. We knew we were not alone in this struggle. Life 
	became Durbishoho (I cant find an appropriate synonym in English). It was 
	an struggle every day for the rest of the nine-month period. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For the last 29 years I have always 
	wondered why the army had targeted our house and our family. It had always 
	been a mystery to me. Now I have some clue to that question after such a 
	long period of time. Ashrafuzzaman Khan (the then member of the central 
	committee of the Islami Chatra Sangha ) used to live at Nakhalpara. This 
	piece of information I got from the Internet. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I write this re-count, I learnt 
	that 100 new 'killing fields' have been discovered all around Bangladesh. 
	Was I surprised? No, not at all! However, what surprised me the most was why 
	did it take so long? Why did we have to wait almost 30 years to know that 
	innocent folks were butchered just as cattle? Rest assured that many more 
	killing fields will be found. The killing fields of Cambodia, Kosovo, 
	Bosnia, Afghanistan, etc., will be nothing when compared to the killing 
	fields in Bangladesh. Let us not forget these killing fields. Let us not 
	forget the sacrifice of 3 million people who shed enough blood to change the 
	verdure of monsoon drenched land of Bengal. They certainly gave their lives 
	so that we can enjoy the fruits of freedom. Freedom from the tyranny of 
	Punjabi masters and Pakistani Oligarchy. I would ask every Bangalees not to 
	forget the butchers of those nights and days when we remember the fallen 
	angels of our land. The crime should never go unpunished. </font></p>
