    was&nbsp;created, women&nbsp;have been&nbsp;abused in many senses, physically, mentally, 
    economically and so on. </span>
    <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Recent statistics also 
    show that domestic violence is present in all parts of the world; the 
    Western world is not excluded. It is imperative to establish the rights of 
    men and women fully.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:13.7pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:13.7pt;margin-left:
0cm"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">In&nbsp;third world 
  countries, women are mostly abused and neglected&nbsp;in the name of religion. As a 
  Bangladeshi woman, I'll talk about the problem of Bangladeshi women. &quot;Acid&quot; is 
  the name of the most dangerous curse now a days. Acid violence is among the 
  grossest of human rights violations, and the goal of this examination is to 
  focus the debate and the point of intervention in order to more effectively 
  address the problem. What can be cruller to a human being than destroy one's 
  own identity? Sometimes when we open a newspaper, we see some faces there 
  which are so defiled, that it is difficult to believe that those are faces of 
  a human being. Generally the women of poor class are the main victims of acid. 
  Approximately 300 people in Bangladesh experience this attack each year, and 
  41 percent of victims are under the age of 18. People of the root level find 
  it the cheapest and easiest way to take revenge. Acid is also an available 
  element. 78 percent of reported acid violence happens to women, with the most 
  common reasons for&nbsp;attack being&nbsp;the dowry problem, the conjugal problem, the 
  refusal of marriage, the denial of sex, the rejection of romance and any kind 
  of misunderstanding in a relationship even in family quarrel. By studying 
  these cases, we see acid victims are mostly in&nbsp;the 10 – 30 age groups. Mostly 
  when women are sleeping or going out for natural necessity, acid is thrown at 
  them through&nbsp;open windows or from hiding places. A cup of acid, usually 
  sulphuric acid poured from any car battery or purchased from auto repair 
  shops, costs only a few cents, and is therefore a cheap and available weapon. 
  Some perpetrators throw acid in an attempt to obtain the victim's land, 
  believing that the family will be forced to sell their property in order to 
  pay for medical treatment.</span></p>

  <span lang="EN-GB">The most crucial part is acid attacks leave victims 
  horribly disfigured because most attacks are</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
  <b>di</b></span><font face="Comic Sans MS"><span lang="EN-GB">rected at the face in 
  order to permanently scar the victim and destroy her physical appearance. 
  Victims don't die but they burn very badly. Sometimes, not only the flesh but 
  the bones are also melted by this. Acid spreads either through the whole body 
  or mostly in upper portion of the body. Often times, the victim is left 
  blinded, deaf or dumb. This also breaks their courage to live and saps their 
  will power&nbsp;to fight against this cruel society. It seems that those who die 
  are relieved and those are alive&nbsp;die each day. They can have no normal life. 
  Along with&nbsp;physical suffering,&nbsp;acid survivors have to deal with mental trauma 
  as well. Many victims are frustrated, and some of them have suicidal 
  tendencies. They need periodic counselling by trained psychotherapists to 
  recover from the shock and frustration. Victims usually become depressed and 
  are treated as outcasts by relatives, neighbours, and friends. Not only does 
  the victim suffer, also, the whole family is suffers with her, equally, 
  both&nbsp;mentally and socially. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Bangladesh is the 
  country with the largest number of acid victims&nbsp;in the whole world. The weak 
  judicial system is the biggest reason for this problem.&nbsp;Acid attackers mostly 
  enjoy the poor structure of the law and also enjoy the social and judicial 
  benefits. It&nbsp;takes very long to dismiss a case in Bangladesh. In year 2000 
  came the law under women and children custody, which said that the death 
  sentence would be the highest penalty for an acid attacker. Criminals, 
  however, take&nbsp;shelter&nbsp;in all sorts of gaps and weak parts of the law and 
  remain free. Lots of people also say there should be also some regulation on 
  selling acid. Not only should the acid thrower&nbsp;be punished, but&nbsp;also the acid 
  seller (who is selling acid without permission) and also each other helpers in 
  this purpose. Bangladesh still suffers from a poorly trained police force and 
  a backlogged court system, both rife with corruption. Therefore, most 
  perpetrators still go unpunished. If history is a lesson, a marked decrease in 
  acid attacks will not occur until the Bangladeshi police and legal systems 
  become more quick and effective, the prerequisite for which is probably a 
  revolution at the heart of the Bangladeshi political system. . Due to poor 
  promotion in the media and a lack of awareness in the people, most people are 
  not aware of the law. As the legal system has not been able to hand out 
  exemplary punishment to any acid attacker so far, attackers have little to 
  fear. And the&nbsp;media needs to work more on this issue. Repeated broadcasts of 
  punishment delivered would tell the public of recourse available to victims 
  and warn potential acid attackers. </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
  <span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Because of this 
  increasing problem, Dhaka Medical College has opened a separate &quot;Burn Unit&quot;.
  </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">This unit, 
  created in the late 1990s, contains 8 beds and employs 3 plastic surgeons. It 
  was the only burn facility in this country of 140 million people; therefore, 
  it was frequently inaccessible to acid victims. But&nbsp;now Bangladesh has about 
  four other hospitals, apart from the Dhaka Medical College, that can provide 
  treatment to acid-attack victims. </span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img border="0" src="int_wo3.jpg" width="249" height="149"></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
  <span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">There is no concrete 
  medicine for this issue. The only method is washing the attacked place by 
  using normal temperate water again and again. </span>
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Victims need long-term 
  as well as short-term care</span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">. 
  Thanks to modern treatment facilities, cosmetic surgery is one of the 
  solutions available. But&nbsp;because it remains a costly project, most victims 
  have to wait for&nbsp;help from a welfare organization.&nbsp; Private donors have been 
  very actively helpful in supporting some of these organizations. </span>
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Acid survivors are never 
  cured completely. Even after extensive treatment gouges inevitably remain, 
  making social reintegration and marriage very difficult.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-top:13.7pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:13.7pt;margin-left:
0cm"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">The fact that acid 
  survivors can never regain their original appearance has a severe impact on 
  their social lives. It is tough for the victims to accept their new 
  identities. Moreover, the working capabilities of acid victims drop 
  significantly. Because of physical problems, such as the loss of their 
  eyesight or hearing and the sensitivity of their skin to heat and sunlight, 
  the victims can only do very limited types of jobs. Their income-generating 
  power decreases. Young victims, meanwhile, have to stop going to school. Even 
  after they have recovered, most of them cannot continue their studies because 
  of their unstable physical conditions. They thus cannot develop skills that 
  they could have fostered otherwise. </span>
  <span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Luckily the welfare 
  organizations are doing lot more than only providing them treatment. They are 
  also taking care of their rehabilitation in this society. They are trying to 
  integrate them in&nbsp;society by providing&nbsp; training such as poultry farming, 
  handicrafts etc. The most delightful part of it is that some acid survivors 
  have shown&nbsp;considerable progress in these activities. </span>
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">Acid violence is yet 
  another horrible chapter in the book of human rights abuses in Bangladesh. One 
  especially positive aspect of efforts against acid violence among 
  Bangladeshis, explains Dr. Morrison, &quot;Bangladeshis are outright shocked and 
  ashamed that the attacks happen here.&quot; A message must be sent to society that 
  the state genuinely considers acid violence a heinous crime and that whoever 
  takes part in the crime will be severely punished. To realise this aim, 
  Bangladesh needs efficient law enforcement agencies and an effective judicial 
  system to work together with the public to bring the perpetrators to justice.
