	<font face="Verdana">Music is poetry distilled into sound, music is the eye 
	of the ear, music is the speech of the angels, music is the medicine of a 
	troubled mind -- music has indeed been defined in a thousand and one ways. 
	Whatever may be the definitions, it is accepted by one and all that music is 
	the language of emotions and that this language is universal, it transcends 
	the barriers men put up against each other. Its vocabulary has been shaped 
	by years of human experiences; its rhetoric mirrors man's existence, his 
	place in nature and in society. Music indeed plays a vital role in the life 
	of a man in every sphere of activity and in every domain of thought. </font></p>

	<font class="caption">Pic: Songs of Freedom: A still from Muktir Gaan 
	directed by Tareque Masud. </p>
	<p></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since music is related to the 
	profoundest experiences of the individual and the group, it is nothing 
	surprising that the tyranny and oppression of the conquering nations and the 
	struggle for freedom of the subjugated also give rise to emotions that find 
	an ideal expression in music. The German War of Liberation against Napoleon 
	in the early part of the 19th century released a surge of patriotic 
	sentiment that resulted in memorable songs and folklore opera like Weber's 
	The Marksman. Poland's struggle for freedom from Tasarist rule aroused the 
	national poet in Chopin. A united Italy seeking independence from Austria 
	found her national artist in Verdi. Quest for independence in the world of 
	music led Russia to Glinka and Tchaichovsky. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh provides an ideal 
	environment for a steady and healthy growth of music. Its countless squares 
	of verdant cropland, luxurious tropical forests, lush green verdure and 
	foliage, meandering rivers and sparkling, ever-flowing rivulets, abundant 
	sunshine together with the quick rotation of six seasons with their varying 
	clouds and characteristics, create an unforgettable impression of peace and 
	fascinating beauty. No wonder, in the historic struggle for liberation in 
	1971 -- one of the bloodiest strifes in history -- music had as usual played 
	a remarkable and significant role. Music has indeed been the authentic voice 
	of a civilisation that has seen many rises and falls, that has passed 
	through and survived many vicissitudes of prosperity and poverty, of glory 
	and abjection, but has never ceased to be creative in the worst periods of 
	defeat, has never abandoned its quest for the Eternal even in periods of 
	highest prosperity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh's struggle for 
	emancipation from the clutches of alien domination has a long and chequered 
	history. The bud of Bangladeshi independence, whose fragrance was 
	effectively perceived for the first time through the glorious Language 
	Movement in 1952, sprouted in all its splendour into a full bloom through 
	the War of Independence in 1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was a song -- Amar Bhaier Raktey 
	Rangano Ekushey February -- with a haunting melody from a genius like Altaf 
	Mahmood -- which had always been a very important factor in keeping up the 
	tempo of our long and gruelling struggle at right pitch. But it would be 
	absolutely unjustified if we prepare any list of songs and melodies that 
	helped to boost up the morale of the freedom-hungry Bangladeshis without 
	first paying tribute to the memory of the two great maestros, Tagore and 
	Nazrul, whose songs have become almost synonymous with the culture and 
	tradition of Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The tremendous impact of Tagore 
	songs on our daily activities, on our hopes and aspirations, and on our 
	struggle for independence is known to one and all. Each change of the 
	season, each aspect of our country's landscape, every undulation of the 
	human heart, in sorrow or in joy, has found its voice in some song of his. 
	In our society, they are sung in religious gatherings no less than in 
	concert halls. Patriots have mounted the gallows with his songs on their 
	lips, and young lovers unable to express the depth of their feeling sing his 
	songs and feel the weight of their dumbness relieved. Foolish attempts at 
	minimising his popularity in the sixties proved futile and to some extent 
	counter-productive -- Bangladeshis very wisely ignored the ignorant. In 
	1971, people even risked their lives to listen to Tagore songs broadcast 
	from the Swadhin Bangla Betar. The due recognition of Amar Sonar Bangla as 
	the National Anthem of sovereign Bangladesh indeed testifies to the glorious 
	contribution of Tagore and his songs to our Liberation Struggle. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Kazi Nazrul Islam, the Great Rebel, 
	perhaps occupies a unique place in the history of struggle for emancipation. 
	The songs of the indomitable Rebel, whom Tagore called &quot;the mutinous child 
	of the goddess of the Universe,&quot; not only played a very vital role in role 
	in our struggle for independence, but also very effectively inspired and 
	influenced freedom fighters in other parts of this sub-continent. He was 
	undoubtedly a genius of the first water, and whether in prose in poetry, our 
	beloved Rebel could breathe fire like an avenging angel and warble, when the 
	mood seized him, like a refreshing, sparkling mounting-stream. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Vibrant words set to exhilarating 
	music, his marching songs spread far and wide and inspired the oppressed and 
	the depressed in every nook and corner of Bangladesh. But this was nothing 
	new -- even Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, while organising the Indian National 
	Army (INA) gratefully acknowledged: &quot;On our way to the war -- we shall sing 
	Nazrul's songs and proceed.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No wonder, the brilliant songs of 
	Nazrul, whose rhythm heaves and swells like the demented waves of the sea 
	lashed by wind, inspired the 75 million Bangladeshis, prepared their 
	imagination for the glorious version of a sovereign state of their own, 
	urging them to wake up from their slumber, to unite and to overthrow the 
	foreign domination -- by &quot;tearing apart, piercing, smashing,&quot; if necessary, 
	even &quot;the sun, the moon, and the planets.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a result, the valiant freedom 
	fighters in 1971 braved the bullets smilingly and marched triumphantly 
	towards emancipation and victory with the songs of the daring Rebel on their 
	lips. Very few of us know that the songs which the Occupation Forces in 1971 
	banned comprised not only Tagore and folk songs but also included a good 
	number of Nazrul songs like Karar Oi Luho Kapat, Bhenge Phyal, and Kar Re 
	Lopat. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Incidentally, it was this banned 
	creation of the great maestro which was very rightly chosen as the first 
	songs to be broadcast from the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra in Mujibnagar on 
	the May 25, 1971. The wise and happy selection of Chal Chal Chal as the 
	March Song of the Bangladesh Armed Forces very eloquently indicates and 
	acknowledges the unsurpassable contribution of Nazrul and his songs to our 
	historic struggle for independence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But Tagore and Nazrul were not the 
	only poets whose songs inspired the Bangladeshis in their long quest for 
	sovereignty. Enchanting melodies like DL Roy's Dhono Dhanye Pushpa Bhara, 
	broadcast over and again by the then Radio Pakistan, Dhaka in March, 1971 
	and the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra in Mujibnagar, fascinated the listeners 
	in the difficult hours. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A good number of poems by the 
	renowned poets like Sukanta Bhattacharya and Jibananda Das, hitherto almost 
	unknown to the realm of music, were set to tunes by the Swadhin Bangla Betar 
	and enthralled the listeners. Many other songs by poets of comparatively 
	lesser calibre and fame also rejuvenated the morale of the suffering 
	millions in the then East Pakistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Village bards like Mohammed Shah 
	Bangalee, Monoranjan Sircar, Shah Ali Sircar, and Mohammad Ali Bangalee took 
	the pain and risk to cross the border and pour out songs to encourage and 
	inspire not only the freedom fighters but also the 65 million captives in 
	the occupied territory as well. The emotion was so intense, the tempo so 
	high, and the spirit so indomitable that even a crippled singer like Mofiz 
	Angur, literally crawling on the ground, had the courage and conviction to 
	reach Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra, not on his feet but on his elbows and 
	knees, to render services to the cause of liberation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is indeed very difficult to throw 
	light on all the hit songs broadcast by the Voice of the Nation, Swadhin 
	Bangla Betar. The limited space available will be too insufficient to cover 
	the long list. A few are cited below to provide only a bird's eye view.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fazle Khoda's Salam, Salam, Hajaar 
	Salam was first broadcast by Radio Pakistan, Dhaka in March 1971. It was 
	repeated innumerable number of times by the Swadhin Bangla Betar. One has to 
	listen to songs like this to realise how compellingly a melody may capture 
	the accent of tenderness and patriotism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;With an endless meaning in the 
	narrow span of a song,&quot; as Tagore called it, Mora Ekti Phul Ke Bachabo Bole 
	Juddhya Kori and Tir Hara Ei Dheuer Shagar Pari Debo go by Apel Mahmood 
	captured the attention millions, and Apel Mahmood as a singer earned 
	overnight nationwide fame. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ek Shagore Rakter Binimoye Banglar 
	Swadhinata Anlo Jara, written by Gobinda Haldar and sung by Apel Mahmood and 
	Swapna Roy, was another top favourite which has been duly selected as the 
	signature tune of BTV's National News. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Syed Shamsul Huda's Rakte Jodi Phote 
	Jibaner Phul Phutuk Na, Abdul Latif's Sona, Sona, Sona, Lokey Bale Sona, TH 
	Sikder's Anek Rakta Diechi Amra, Habibur Rahman's Protidiner Suryadaye Tomai 
	Dheki, Sikander Abu Zafar's Janater Sangram Cholbe Cholbe, Shahidul Islam's 
	Chand Tumi Phire Jao, were some of the haunting melodies which not only rose 
	to the occasion but also boosted up the morale of the Bangladehis, the heart 
	of each one of whom throbbed with genuine emotions, pulsated with hopes and 
	aspirations, dreamed beautiful dreams of a free Bangladesh, a happier 
	Bangladesh, a renascent Bangladesh, a sovereign Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not that each and every song 
	put out by Swadhin Bangla Betar was a hit. But there is simply no denial of 
	the fact that for sheer delight in the creation of forms, for the correct 
	seriousness of mood, playfulness of thought and liveliness of language, for 
	exquisite frivolity of genius, Bangla music never produced anything finer, 
	whether before or after, than the songs which led the Bangladeshis to 
	ultimate victory and sovereignty in 1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In beautiful songs like Habibur 
	Rahman's Muktir Aki Path Sangram and Md Muniruzzaman's Bandhu Ebar Tule Nao 
	Hatey Hat, both blessed with the golden touch of Azad Rahman's magic wand, 
	the imagery and diction conjure up the black terror of the elements, the 
	accents resound with the thunder of doom -- each testifies to the fact that 
	humanity is not flotsam and jetsam to drift along with the waters, following 
	the easy path of least resistance, humanity is like a rock in the midst of 
	swirling waters holding aloft its great heritage over the flux. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But as regards popularity, it was 
	perhaps Joy Bangla Banglar Joy which topped the list. The lilting melody of 
	Anwar Parvez together with the enchanting voice of Shahnaz Rahmatullah and 
	the lyric by Gazi Mazharul Anwar resulted in a superb production which was 
	adored and literally hummed by millions, young and old, even in the worst 
	period of occupation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It should be mentioned in this 
	connection that Mafizur Rahman, the first Bengali Director General of Radio 
	Pakistan, had the guts to permit in writing the broadcast of this popular 
	song from all the six Radio Stations in the then East Pakistan. This lilting 
	melody became so popular that it was selected as the signature tune of the 
	voice of the oppressed and depressed Bangladeshis -- Swadhin Bangla Betar 
	Kendra. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Purbo Digante Shurya Utechhe was 
	another song which enthralled the listeners all over the sub-continent. This 
	beautiful song emanated from the powerful pen of Gobinda Haldar and was 
	blessed with the experience of a maestro like Samar Das. Another remarkable 
	creation was Sardar Alauddin's Jagat Bashi Dekhey Jao Ashia. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is needless to emphasise that 
	those who successfully tried to motivate the Bangladeshis through songs and 
	music towards the ultimate goal of liberation had to face many a trial and 
	tribulation. The political implications of musical nationalism were not lost 
	upon the authorities. The valiant Director General of Radio Pakistan, who 
	had the courage and conviction to permit in writing broadcast of Joy Bangla 
	Banglar Joy, was suddenly transferred to a comparatively weaker or 
	insignificant post. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For his golden voice behind numerous 
	songs like Salam Salam Hajaar Salam and Sangram, Sangram, Sangram, Abdul 
	Jabber was given 14 years' rigorous imprisonment. A good number of officers 
	of Radio Pakistan, Dhaka were suspended and interrogated by the occupation 
	army. Some were even physically tortured or dismissed. Day in and day out 
	attempts were made to nip in the bud the endeavour of the singers and the 
	composers to rouse the nation towards Bangladeshi nationalism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Censoring went to such a ridiculous 
	extent that even the inimitable words of Kazi Nazrul Islam were changed to 
	satisfy ignorance and foolishness. But this was nothing new in history. 
	Verdi's operas had to be altered again and again to suit the Austrian 
	censor. Sibelius' Finlandia with its rousing trumpet calls was forbidden by 
	the Tsarist police when Finland was demanding her independence at the turn 
	of the nineteenth century. But who can stop the nightingale from singing?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The torture and tyranny proved to be 
	a blessing in disguise -- Bangladeshis drew such strength, vigour, and music 
	out of it that the experiment may be said to have revolutionised the very 
	future of Bangladeshi music. For composers and singers started pouring out 
	in greater numbers and in hitherto unknown excellence. None cared what his 
	fate might be, but knew it well that he had &quot;lived in love, and not in mere 
	time.&quot; On being asked, &quot;Will thy songs remain?&quot; he would smile and say, in 
	the words of Tagore: </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I know not, but this I know </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That often when I sang I found my 
	eternity.&quot;</font></p>
