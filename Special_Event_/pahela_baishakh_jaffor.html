<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">Last year’s <i>Pahela Baishakh</i> 
(Bengali New Year) celebration that took place on April 14, 2001, at Ramna’s <i>
Boto-Mool </i>(Foot of the Banyan Tree) was marred by a bomb blast that killed 
10 innocent bystanders. It was never ruled out completely whether one of the 
bombers was killed in the carnage.&nbsp; A year went by but the police investigation 
was mysteriously incomplete as is the case with other bomb blasts that rocked 
this nation inhabited by 130 million impoverished people.</font><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">Sitting far away from our ancestral 
place, Bangladesh, many of us were eager to know this time around whether this 
year’s <i>Pahela Baishakh </i>was celebrated without any violence.&nbsp; Most western 
news agency such as Associated Press and Reuters have reported that this year’s 
celebration had no violence associated with it and hearing the good news we all 
heaved a great sigh of relief.&nbsp; Mr. Farid Hossain, an Associated Press writer 
stationed in Dhaka wrote as follows on April 14, 2002, describing the origin of
<i>Pahela Baishakh</i>:</font> <br>
<font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">“Islamic Bangladesh officially 
    follows the Gregorian calendar and many people celebrate Dec. 31 as the New 
    Year's Eve.&nbsp; But more popular are the Islamic Eid al-Fitr holiday and the 
    Bengali New Year's. Eid is celebrated at the end of the fasting month of 
    Ramadan.</font><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font> </p>
    <p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">The Bengali New Year's Day was 
    introduced by the 16th century Mogul emperor Akbar, coinciding it with the 
    start of the crop harvest, mainly to facilitate collection of crop tax. In 
    neighboring India and Nepal, the Hindu new year was also being celebrated 
    Sunday.”</font></p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">Please note carefully that Associate 
Press story identified our motherland as “<b><font color="#006600">Islamic 
Bangladesh</font></b>.”&nbsp; This hardly comes as a great surprise after the article 
Mr. Bertil Lintner wrote on recent developments in Bangladesh vis-à-vis rise in 
Islamic Fundamentalism.&nbsp; It won’t be too far from now when other western news 
organization such as Reuters, NY Times, Washington Post, etc., will add the 
adjective “Islamic” that befits Bangladesh.</font><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">Now let me get back to the main topics 
of this write-up, which is the crime scene of last year’s carnage on <i>Pahela 
Baishakh</i>.&nbsp; The Ramna Park is really an oasis for the people of Dhaka.&nbsp; This 
piece of land – hardly 1.5 square mile—is the only greenery left undeveloped.&nbsp; I 
saw a map of Dhaka in the Internet dating back to 1920s.&nbsp; The map shows this 
park identifying it as Ramna Race Course.&nbsp; During British Raj before the 
partition of India, Dhaka’s Ramna Race Course used to house a club for the 
military.&nbsp; This used to be called Ramna Gymkhana.&nbsp; In the early fifties Dhaka’s 
inhabitants used to identify the park as Gymkhana Race Course Maidan.&nbsp; On most 
Sundays, there used to be horse racing going on in the afternoon.&nbsp; It was a 
legal gambling set up.&nbsp; The Pakistanis never found it wrong to gamble on 
horses.&nbsp; However, a secularist by the name Sheikh Mujibur Rahman stopped the 
horse racing sometime in 1972.&nbsp; The Ramna race Course was famous for other 
reasons.&nbsp; First, it housed the famous Ramna Kali Bari.&nbsp; Unfortunately, one would 
not find any traces of the famous Kali Bari because the Pakistani military wiped 
the Mandir and the Ashram from Ramna in March and April of 1971.&nbsp; Ramna Race 
Course Maidan also served as the venue for Sheikh Mujib’s historic meeting of 
March 7, 1971.&nbsp; Also, after the independence of Bangladesh India’s Prime 
Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi came to Dhaka in 1972.&nbsp; The stage Bangladesh built 
where she stood and gave a public lecture in Ramna Maidan was dubbed ‘The Indira 
Moncho,’ which was later dismantled during the military rule in Bangladesh.</font><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>

<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">In short, Ramna <i>Maidan</i> is a 
historic place.&nbsp; One can find the burial ground of three eminent Bengali 
politicians (Nazimuddin, Suhrawardy, and Fazlul Huq) on the southwestern corner 
of the park.&nbsp; Many cultural functions are still hosted in Ramna Maidan.&nbsp; On the 
northeastern section of the park, one can find many big-sized banyan trees 
standing next to a big pond.&nbsp; These trees throw down their adventitious roots 
from the big branches.&nbsp; One of the big banyan tree serves as the venue for <i>
Pahela Baishakh</i>’s festivity hosted by Dhaka’s school <i>Chayanaut</i>, which 
specializes in <i>Rabindra Sangeet</i> (Tagore's Songs).&nbsp; It has become a 
tradition for the past three decades for <i>Chayanaut Shilpi Ghosti</i> to greet 
the Bangla New Year at the base of this banyan tree.&nbsp; A wall encircles the base 
of the tree.&nbsp; In mid April the beating sunrays warm up Bengal quite a bit.&nbsp; 
Therefore, it makes full sense to gather underneath the canopy of either Banyan 
(bot), Asottho, Pakur trees (these are similar trees that grow throughout 
Bengal).&nbsp; Since Dhaka’s Ramna <i>Maidan</i> (Ground) has many banyan trees next 
to the lake in the northeastern corner, it is an ideal place for mass 
gathering.&nbsp; Every year Dhaka’s people flock to this site early in the morning to 
greet the Bangla New Year with Rabindra Sangeet.&nbsp; This has become a part and 
parcel of <i>Pahela Baishakh</i> celebration.&nbsp; However, things were not right in 
the year 2001.&nbsp; The entire nation of Bangladesh was rocked that year by the 
blasting of quite a few homemade powerful bombs that killed many bystanders 
mostly at the public gathering and musical soirees.&nbsp; Bangladesh folks thought 
the festivity surrounding <i>Pahela Baishakh</i> would be free from any 
violence; never mind the blasting of bombs.&nbsp; But how wrong they were.&nbsp; When the 
program was going on in full swing, bombs were detonated in one corner of the 
banyan tree.&nbsp; There was some confusion at the sound of the detonation of 
powerful bomb.&nbsp; When the smoke cleared, nine people lay dead.&nbsp; One person later 
died in the hospital bringing the casualties to 10 people.&nbsp; It is a sad 
testament that the inept police force could not guarantee the safeguard of New 
Year’s celebrants.&nbsp; A year passed by still the case has not gone to the court.&nbsp; 
The investigation perhaps is not complete.&nbsp; And one simply wonders – why?</font><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">Hardly two months after the blast, I 
visited the place in mid June in a hot summer day.&nbsp; I had to ask some street 
vendors and a restaurant manager nearby the <i>Boto Mool</i> to show me the 
exact place where the <i>Pahela Baishakh </i>carnage took place in Bangla Year 
1408 (April 14, 2001).&nbsp; There are quite a few big banyan trees nearby; 
therefore, one can become confused unless someone knowledgeable could point out 
the right banyan tree.&nbsp; The place was very peaceful.&nbsp; One could lie down at the
<i>Boto Mool</i> and take a siesta without even knowing that this innocuous 
place could have suddenly metamorphosed into a dangerous place by the action of 
some vile terrorists.&nbsp; There is no question in our mind that those who do not 
like the free mixing of adult men and women in public appointed these 
terrorists.&nbsp; We have heard so many times that some Mullahs have passed fatwa on 
Pahela Baishakh characterizing the event as non-Islamic.&nbsp; They wrongly opined 
that good Muslims should never patronize such Hindu influenced events.</font><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">I could not find any traces of blood or 
any thing that could remind me that this placid shady-place had become the scene 
of a carnage in the morning hours of <i>Pahela Baishakh</i> a year ago.&nbsp; 
Bangalees are very forgetful people.&nbsp; I don’t blame them for their amnesiac 
mind.&nbsp; Life is rough and tough.&nbsp; There are many other things in life that need 
due attention.&nbsp; Therefore, killing of a few people at the base of the banyan 
tree on <i>Pahela Baishakh</i> hardly settles in one’s mind.&nbsp; Therefore, when I 
saw modern-day Romeos and Juliets sitting nearby, sipping ice cold Pepsi or 
Fanta engrossed in their own world, it hardly surprised anyone.&nbsp; There is a 
restaurant near gate at the northeastern side of the park.&nbsp; To reach the <i>Boto 
Mool</i> it is best to enter via this gate.&nbsp; The restaurant I saw was doing a 
brisk business.&nbsp; The customers are mostly the college-going kids in pair.&nbsp; They 
can easily see the site of <i>Pahela Baishakh</i> carnage from this eatery.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless, that hardly bothers them as I have pointed out earlier.&nbsp; 
Practicality reigns over emotionalism.&nbsp; The city teenagers need some privacy; 
the <i>Boto Mool's </i>verdant area provides the space.&nbsp; What more could they 
ask?</font><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font> </p>
<center>
<p><img border="0" src="Ramna2.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
</center><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">I also found a large pond next to the 
Boto Mool.&nbsp; It is both picturesque and serene.&nbsp; Dhaka has become very congested 
over the years.&nbsp; The city has grown 10-folds to about 8 million from 0.8 million 
in the last thirty years. Most empty plots have vanished already.&nbsp; Therefore, a 
visit to Ramna <i>Maidan </i>is still a delight.&nbsp; There is this Children’s Park 
(Shishu Park) where one can see an emaciated amusement park.&nbsp; The place is 
practically crowded with adults and kids.&nbsp; Thus, Ramna’s <i>Boto Mool </i>still 
serves the need for romance-seeking youngsters.&nbsp; And they get it all right.</font><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS"></font>
</p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Comic Sans MS">As I was returning from the <i>Boto Mool</i>, 
I asked myself – how long Bangalees will remember this carnage?&nbsp; On December 16, 
1971, Pakistan’s vile General Niazi surrendered to India’s Lt. General Jagjit 
Singh Aurora by placing his revolver on a table right here in Ramna race 
Course.&nbsp; How many folks still remember that seminal event of Bangladesh's 
history?&nbsp; Not many.&nbsp; Bangladesh voters have elected some Islamists in the last 
year’s (2001) general election to represent them in the legislative assembly.&nbsp; 
Two of them are now ministers in Khaleda Zia’s cabinet.&nbsp; But it hardly matters 
that many folks who supported the brutal Pakistani regime are now holding power 
in Bangladesh.&nbsp; As I have alluded to earlier, in Bangladesh, practicality takes 
precedence over emotionalism.&nbsp; In a nation where folks have to work very hard to 
secure two square meals a day, emotionalism, sentimentality, emotiveness, etc., 
have lesser value.&nbsp; In about a decade or so, there will be no mention of <i>
Pahela Baishakh </i>massacre at the <i>Boto Mool</i>. Teenagers rushed by the 
desire to meet theirs loved one will still flock to the <i>Boto Mool</i> or 
nearby places.&nbsp; Perhaps they will sip the ice-cold pop soda in the summer days 
and glanced at their lovers' face with a bleary eye while forgetting all the 
while that they are sitting right on the spot where 10 people had to die 
needlessly to greet the Bangla New Year <i>Pahela Baishakh on </i>April 14, 
2001.</font> <br>
