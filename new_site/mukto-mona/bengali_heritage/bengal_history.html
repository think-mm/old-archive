  <h1 align="center">History of Bangla</h1>
  <p>The ancient, medieval, and colonial history of Bangladesh covers a period 
  from antiquity to 1947, when India was partitioned. So the history of&nbsp; 
  Bangladesh prior to 1947 is a history of India of which Bangladesh was a part. 
  In fact, the history of India is a history of Bengal for the large part. Today 
  Bangladesh is an independent nation within the Indian subcontinent, but is 
  less than half of the old Bengal or Bangla.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Prehistory: Introduction</b></p>
  <p>The modern state of Bangladesh officially came into existence through a 
  people's liberation war in 1971. Bangladesh is the eastern part of Bangla. 
  Bangladesh (East Bangla) and West Bangla (India) are the same nation and 
  together they once formed the major part of Bangla (Banga or Gaur). There were 
  some other parts of Bangla though that are no longer within East or West 
  Bangla. Bangla was divided into East and West parts by the British, first in 
  1905, but it proved unpopular and was reversed in 1911. Later during the 
  partition of India, rich Muslim landlords in the East supported the division. 
  So again since 1947, Bangla is divided into at least two parts. Bangla was 
  ultimately ruined by this division and today there are even those who have&nbsp;<br>
  been culturally so much derooted that they feel that the people of the other 
  Bangla are foreigners! That is one of the greatest achievement of British 
  imperialism. Bangla was one of the most important centres of India and now it 
  is a ruined nation no longer a potential threat to the west. Its long and 
  great history is forgotten by the world and also many Bangalees today. Even 
  though Bangladesh is a modern state, her history can be traced back to about 
  1000 BC. There are many theories about the origin of the name Banga or Bangla. 
  Some linguists believe that the name originates from the Tibetan word, &quot;Bans&quot; 
  which means wet or moist and Banga (Bengal) is a wet country crisscrossed by a 
  thousand rivers and washed by monsoons and floods from the Himalayas. Some 
  others believe that the name originated from the Bodo (original Asamese in 
  North Eastern India) &quot;Bang La&quot; which means wide plains. This theory is 
  extremely plausible. Another school suggests the name comes from the name of 
  Prince Banga. According to legend, Prince Banga, the son of King Bali and 
  Queen Sudeshna of the Lunar dynasty was the first to colonise Bangla. What is 
  probably the real root is from the name of the original people of Bangla. This 
  also is taken from legend. One of the tribes who according to a claim emerged 
  from the Indus Civilization after its demise had entered the plains of Bengal 
  while others went elsewhere. They were called the Bong tribe and spoke 
  Dravidian. We know from many ancient Aryan texts of a tribe called Banga that 
  existed in that region.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Archeology</b><br>
  <br>
  Geology and archaeology tell us that Bangla was formed 1 to 6.5 million years 
  ago and the first known human habitation goes back to 100, 000 years in the 
  past. Paleolithic tools and implements from a hundred thousand years ago have 
  been found in Deolpota in West Bangla and 15, 000 year old implements have 
  been found in South East Bangladesh. New Stone Age civilisation, showing 
  connection with that of Bihar, Orissa and Asam existed in Bangla around 3000 
  to 1500 BC.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then suddenly a metal processing civilization appears. Archaeology has not 
  been able to find the missing link from stone tools to metal tools use. This 
  might suggest the influx of a new people into the region and maybe this goes 
  hand in hand with the legends. The Indus civilization ended around 1800 BCE 
  and there is a marked change in Bangla around this time...this ties in with 
  the story of the Bong and Al peoples. Recently an ancient city has been 
  discovered in West Bangla at Chandraketugarh near Berachampa, in North 24 
  Pargana. The city is presumed to be of King Chandraketu from the Gupta era 
  (4th to 6th century AD) but will await carbon 14 tests. Statues of Goddess 
  Yakshi have been discovered here. At Berachampa is another location of 
  interest. Here the'khana-mihir's dhibi was found, a site with Gupta temples. 
  In Jessore, Bangladesh (East Bangla), the Bharat Bhanya site has been 
  tentatively assigned to the Gupta period as well. (Md. Shafiqul Alam, Deccan 
  College, Pune 411 006)<br>
  <br>
  We can assume cities existed in ancient Bangla, however, not many ruins dating 
  back in or before the first millennium BC have been located. Certainly some 
  cities like Pundra are refered to in ancient Aryan texts before there was much 
  contact between the Aryans and the Bangales. Were the ruins such as 
  ChandraketuGarh (Gaur) built upon older cities of the past?&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  In the ancient Aryan texts, Purs were mentioned describing forts or cities of 
  the Drabirs of the Indus civilization. The interesting thing is names of 
  places in the Indus region often end with -Pur and likewise in Bangla, place 
  names commonly end in -Pur.<br>
  <br>
  <b>A Lost History<br>
&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p>Many assume that South India and Bengal were backwaters because of the lack 
  of interest of the Aryan scriptures in them. They were not backwaters but 
  simply they were non-Aryans. Since Bangla and South India were not Aryan, they 
  are not highlighted in the history of the Aryans or North India. However, 
  since there were powerful kingdoms and cities in Bangla that were in close 
  proximity to the Aryans, Bangla is mentioned somewhat. Also because of 
  Buddha's travellings, there are some more references. (Note: the earliest 
  references are mostly disdainful. If anyone travelled to the Drabir land, then 
  their would be pennances and ritual sacrifices). Dance forms seem to have 
  originated in Drabir India. South Indians have given us several unique dance 
  forms and Gaur of Bangla has also&nbsp;given us unique dance forms. From the ruins 
  of ancient Indus civilization we find dancing girl figurines which indicate 
  the origin of the dances of India.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Even the ancient texts, however, whether intentionally or not, reveal the 
  greatness of Bangla. In Bhishma-parban, the Bangalee kings heroically face 
  attacks from the Pandus or conquerors of Upper India. There is a description 
  of the encounters between the Pandus and the mighty ruler of the Bangas. While 
  some of the Bangalee kings fought on elephants, others rode on ocean-bred 
  steeds of the hue of the moon. What were these ocean bred steeds of the hue of 
  the moon? Were they ships? In the very ancient times, Pundra, Gaur (Gaud or 
  Garh), Rarh (Radha,&nbsp;Ladha), Sumha, Bajra (Brahma), Tamralipti, Samatata, Banga 
  and Anga comprised Bangla. At one time Gaur was the name used for the Bangla 
  region but the name Banga later became popular. This might reflect the 
  prominence of the regions in a period whose history is lost. Banga is first 
  mentioned in the Aiterya Aranyaka, a Hindu scripture. The book mentions Banga 
  as a non-Aryan (Drabir) nation. In the Aitareya Brahma, the people of Pundra 
  tribe (along with Andhra, Shabara, Mulinda and Mutiba tribes) is called dasyu, 
  clearly non-Aryan or Drabir.<br>
  Bangla is also mentioned in the Mahabharat, one of the four great epics. In 
  the great war of Kurukshetra described in the Mahabharat, a Bangalee king 
  fought for the Kaurabs (Kaurabs are supposed to be the villains. They are most 
  probably Aryans and so this might show the beginings of Aryan-Drabir alliance 
  makings.). In another instance, King Basudeb of Gaur (old name for Bangla) 
  fought with Krishna in Dwarka, a port city in Gujarat on the western part of 
  India. The Mahabharat also mentions three Bangalee princes who try for the 
  hand of princess Draupadi. In this epic, some Bangalees are mentioned as 
  untouchables. These were the coastal tribes of Bangla who were called 
  Mlechchha. All the tribes in Bangla (and Kalinga, a South East Indian empire 
  and even Magadh and Anga (Bangla) were considered non-Aryan. Banga and Kalinga 
  were Drabir even in Mahabir's time and Aryanization only began with Ashok when 
  part of it was under the Mauryan empire. As Aryanization penetrated into Manu 
  classified Bangla (Pundra), Shaka and Drabira as fallen Kshatryias (Kshatriyas 
  were the warior or ruling caste). This was an attempt to incorporate them into 
  the Aryan caste system. Towards Arjun's time, Mahabharat and the Bayu and 
  Matsyapuranas also call Bangalees (Pundra and Banga, Sumhas) Kshatriyas. And 
  later the Jaina Pragyapana calls Bangaless (Banga and Rarh) Aryans signifying 
  the beginning of absorption. It was probably then that the caste system became 
  rigid and oppressive to maintain segregation.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#800000">&quot;The Culture of India is pre-Aryan in origin. As in 
  Greece, the&nbsp;conquered countries civilized the conquerors. The Aryan Indian 
  owed&nbsp;his civilization and his degeneration to the Dravidians as the 
  Aryan&nbsp;Greek to the Mycaeneans.&quot; --</font> <i>Hall: Ancient History of the&nbsp;Near 
  East<br>
  </i><br>
  It was only during the Gupta rule around the 4th century period that 
  Aryanization fully penetrates Bangla. The caste structure is instilled and 
  Brahmans (highest caste) are mentioned. Batsyan in his Kamsutra (the bible of 
  sex) mentions Brahmans in Bengal. Vatsayana talks about handsome Bangalees who 
  painted their nails to attract girls. Ancient Bangalee men painted their nails 
  to attract girls. This is the earliest mention of coloring nails. In the 
  ancient Indus, girls used lipstick which is also another first use.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <b>Ancient Hindu Center</b> </p>
  <p>Many think that the concepts of karma and transmigration of the soul, the 
  practice of yoga, the worship of Shib, Debi and Bisnu, and other rituals that 
  are not Vedic came from the Aryans. However, these are now believed to have 
  existed in Bangla before Aryanization. This is also supported by the fact that 
  today at least Yoga and Shiva are associated with the Indus civilization which 
  existed before the coming of the Aryans. The cultivation of rice and other 
  crops such as the betel leaf, coconut, tamarind and nut, the Hindu dress of 
  dhuti, marriage rituals with vermilion and turmeric, and many other customs 
  come from pre-Aryan ancestors.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <b>Age of Glory<br>
  </b><br>
  Bangla history in the 1st millennium BC was that of glory and expansion. This 
  period is connected not to North India but to South India and the Eastern 
  Asia. Its expansion was a maritime expansion. Bengal was an ancient seafaring 
  nation, possibly a continuation of the seafaring of the Indus days. As early 
  as 544 BC, Bangalee prince, Bijay Singha of Bangla established the first 
  kingdom in Sri Lanka. The ancient name of Sri Lanka, Singhal comes from the 
  name of Bijay Singha. The Sri Bijaya empire of Indonesia that dominated East 
  Asia for over a millennium bears Sri Bijaya's name, possibly meaning that it 
  was founded by him. This empire is known to have been a strong indian centre 
  as early as 135 AD by&nbsp;the Chinese, which means that Indians (Bangalees) were 
  there earlier in history, possibly the 6th/5th century BC, if Sri Bijaya 
  founded the empire. From here the region of cambodia to Vietnam was dominated 
  by the ancient Bangalees. Madras was another kingdom established by the 
  Bangalees. These show that Bangla was a well organized land even in antiquity. 
  This period of expansion is unmatched in later history. An intersting point to 
  note: the Madras people are Tamil (Dramila) were the original Bagnalees same 
  as Tamils?<br>
  <br>
  <b>Early History<br>
&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p>In India, the ancient kingdoms were called Mahajanapadas. There were 
  several of them all over Northern India. Anga, Ashmak, Avanti, Chedi, Gandhar, 
  Kashi, Kosala, Magadha ( in Bihar and later annexed part of Bangla and 
  adjoining areas when it started expansion), Matsya, Shursen and Batsa (today: 
  Kasuambi in Bihar, King of Batsa, Udayana was Buddha's follower) were the 
  major kingdoms. Some Mahajanapadas like Banga, Kamboj, Koliya, Kuru, Lichhavi, 
  Moriya, Panchal, Shakya (Buddha's family ruled here), and Brijji were 
  republican states. The republican states were not ruled by kings but had 
  assemblies of senior and responsible elders called 'Gana-parishad'. (This is 
  still visible in villages in India.) The Magadha, Kosala, Batsya (Bihar), and 
  Avanti (Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh) were the most notable kingdoms of ancient 
  India.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Anga: Anga was an ancient kingdom. The people were originally Drabir but were 
  absorbed early in the Aryanization process. They had become part of Magadha in 
  the 6th century BC. Anga was part of Bangla but now mostly lies in Bihar, 
  including her capital, Monghyr.<br>
  <br>
  Ashmak:&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Avanti: A kingdom near Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh. He warred with Magadh,&nbsp;<br>
  Kosala, and Batsa. Eventually Magadha emerged victor.<br>
  <br>
  Gandhar: Present day Afganistan. Afganistan was part of India until the 10th 
  century when it was overrun by foreign invaders.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Kashi: Today Kashi remains as the famous holy city Banarasi or Banaras.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Kosala: Of all the small kingdoms in North India, the history of Magadha and 
  Kosala are documented well, because of Buddha and Mahabir's presence there. 
  There are references to Bangla, since Buddha had travelled there to preach. 
  Kosala was an empire roughly the size of Britain and is also the birth place 
  of Raam, the Hindu Avatar. It existed in Central North India, with capital at 
  Ayoddhya. Shrabasti, Kushabati and Saket were its other famous cities. 
  Archeological excavations have shown the remains of a great empire there, 
  which existed sometime between the end of the Harappan civilization and the 
  emergence of historical empires in India whose tales might be recorded in the 
  Mahabharat and Ramayan. The legendary Tirthankaras of Jain are also from here. 
  Kosala was ruled by Prasenajit during the time of Buddha, around the 6th 
  century BC.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Magadh: Neighbouring Magadh (an ancient Drabir nation) started getting 
  powerful in the 7th century BC. It started out as a sixth of the size of 
  Kosala in the extreme south east of Bihar. Its old capital was at Rajgriha (Rajgir) 
  in present day Bihar. In the 6th century BC, it was definitely a major power 
  under King Bimbisara. (It must be noted that Bimbisara had married Prasenajits' 
  sister.) Part of the rise in Magadh's power was due to its king Bimbisara's 
  bold new strategy. Until then in Magadh the armies were loyal to the different 
  tribes but Bimbisara changed this making the armies loyal to himself. Magadh 
  is the first kingdom recorded in Indian history that attempted to create a 
  great empire. There is evidence that Buddha himself had counseled the King 
  Bimbisara of Magadha as how to subjugate and annex the neighboring Lichabi 
  republic (D.P. Singhal pg. 57). Later Bimbisara became the first patron of 
  Buddhism. Buddha had highly influenced Bimbisara. The capital of Magadh also 
  became Buddha's homebase. There were thousands of Magadhans who had converted 
  to buddhism by then. It must be noted that Prasenajit later converted too, 
  leading to massive success of early Buddhism. By the time Magadha started to 
  expand, there was probably a high degree of Aryan penetration into Magadh, as 
  evidenced by the fact that Buddha spoke Maghdi Sanskrit, which is an Aryan 
  language. Magadha was probably one of the first Aryo-Drabir synthesis centres. 
  Both the Buddhist and Jain religion (which in antiquity originates in Kosala) 
  developed here. In its early stage it anexed the smaller kingdoms of Kashi, 
  Madra and Anga (Bangla). And also lost in antiquity, Prasenjit carried out a 
  long protracted war with Magadh. Eventually Prasenajit was deposed by his son 
  and Kosala was overwhelmed by Magadh. Thus Magadh now stretched all across 
  Northern India becoming the first historical empire of North India. King 
  Ajarsatru, son of Bimbisara started the task of building the empire in 490 BC 
  and Magadh was extended under great Nanda kings as far west as Punjab. The 
  Nanda kings had set up an effective ministrative system that was necessary to 
  run their large empire. The huge four-fold army of&nbsp; two hundred thousand 
  infantry, twenty thousand cavalry, two thousand chariots and three thousand 
  elephants. They introduced the stem of standard weights and measures (if this 
  is the one used in modern India then it is remarkable that it was base 16 like 
  ancient Indus). The Nanda Kings were patrons of art and literature. By the 
  time Alexander conquers northern India in 326 BC, Magadh was a great empire 
  under the Nandas and this was the seed from which the Mauryan empire 
  germinated, retaining the great bureaucracy, army and passion for arts and 
  literature of the Nanda kings.&nbsp;<br>

  <b>Earliest Western References</b> </p>
  <p>Gangariday (Bangalee) king had 4 thousand war trained elephants. The 
  periods just before the Mauryan empire and after it is almost nonexistent in 
  India. However, some history can be collected from Greek sources. The first 
  western reference comes from Alexander's invasion of India. Alexander had 
  conquered much of the &quot;known world&quot; and had defeated the western kingdoms of 
  India. They were stopped at the Magadh empire. The Greek historians suggest 
  that Alexander retreated fearing valiant attacks of the mighty Gangariday and 
  Prasioi empires which were located in the Bangla region. Alexander's 
  historians refer to Gangariday as a people who lived in the lower Ganges and 
  its tributaries. These empires attest the level of organization of the peoples 
  of Bangla region. These names are again mentioned by Diodorus. He describes 
  Gangariday as a nation beyond the Ganges, whose king had 4 thousand war 
  trained and equipped elephants. Later Periplus and Ptolemy also indicate that 
  Bangla was organized into a powerful kingdom at the onset of the first 
  millennium AD. When Greek historian Periplus talks about India in the first 
  century AD, apparently he speaks of Bangla. He says, <font color="#800000">
  &quot;There is a river near it called the Ganges (Ganga)&quot;</font> ...<font color="#800000">On 
  its bank is a market town which has the same name as the river, Ganges (Ganga). 
  Through this place are brought malabathrum and Gangetic spikenard and pearls 
  and muslins of the finest sorts, which are called Gangetic. It is said that 
  there are gold mines near these places, and there is a gold coin which is 
  called caltis. And&nbsp;just opposite this river there is an island in the ocean, 
  the last part of the inhabited world towards the east, under the rising sun 
  itself, it is called Chryse; and it has the best tortoise-shell of all the 
  places on the Erythrean Sea&quot; (<i>Sudheer's India's Contribution to the World's 
  Culture</i>). ... But the waves utterly overwhelmed it, and Chryse sank and 
  disappeared in the depths.</font>..&quot; --( <i>Pausanias, Description of Greece 
  8.33.4)</i><br>
  <br>
  It is apparent that these empires existed before the Mauryan empire and 
  continued after the fall of that empire. Some believe Bangla was part of the 
  Mauryan Empire. However, it seems that these two kingdoms continued to exist 
  even after the Mauryan empire. Part of Bangla, namely Anga and Pundra were 
  probably under the Mauryan empire but the rest of Bangla remained outside the 
  Mauryan empire. It is possible that these two empires entered into alliance 
  with the Magadhans prior to the formation of the Mauryan empire thus retaining 
  independence. Or simply the Bangla empires might have been too powerful (note 
  they had more war elephants than the Mauryans which might indicate their 
  power).&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <b>Muslin Fabric<br>
  </b>The ancient western reference to the Muslin shows that the legendary 
  fabric is not a new export of Bangla but ancient. It must take its rightful 
  place with cotton and silk fabrics that go back in time in Bangla. The British 
  colonialists deliberately destroyed the Muslin production (to market the 
  Britsh cotton in India) by brutally chopping the Muslin weavers' thumps off.) 
  The Muslin was legendary because a 50 meter long Muslin fabric could be 
  squeezed into a matchbox. Today's Muslin is a different fabric altogether. The 
  technology is lost.<br>
  <font color="#800000">&quot;.......As to young ladies damping down their muslin 
  gowns to make them&nbsp;cling was probably not an English affectation, more than it 
  might&nbsp;have been a French fad, and during 1795-1810 than the English&nbsp;Regency 
  that was 1810-1820. Fashion plates of the period, especially&nbsp;from Heideloff's 
  &quot;Gallery of Fashion&quot; and &quot;Ackermann's&quot; show English&nbsp;ladies more &quot;bundled up&quot; 
  than their French counterparts. There were&nbsp;some fantastic extremes of fashion 
  during the French Directorie&nbsp;period, but the influenza outbreaks during 
  1795-1805 probably had&nbsp;<br>
  more to do with cold wet winters and shortages of food, especially&nbsp;during 
  wartime than what ladies wore--men died of influenza too and&nbsp;doctors couldn't 
  blame it on them wearing muslin gowns, cashmere&nbsp;shawls and sandals even in the 
  coldest weather. Besides, only a very&nbsp;few could afford gowns and shawls of 
  such expensive materials,&nbsp;especially as muslin couldn't stand up to hard wear 
  and the needed&nbsp;frequent washing to keep it clean and white.......&quot;</font>

  <b>Alexander's Indian Adventure<br>
  </b><br>
  In 518 BC, King Darius of Persia had conquered North West India including&nbsp;<br>
  parts of Punjab. The Indian kings of this region were subordinate kings of&nbsp;<br>
  Persia. The Persians coined the term Hindu to describe the people of India. It 
  was a mispronunciation of Sindhu, the large river of western India, now in 
  Pakistan.<br>
  <br>
  When Alexander defeated Persia (around 320s BC), and came to India, he met the 
  subordinate states of Persia. These states were nonetheless powerful. 
  Alexander wanted to go to the famed city of Taksha Shila (Taxila, North India) 
  across the Sindhu River (Indus). On his way there, he defeated the Ashwakas, 
  who attacked him, in a fierce battle. By the time he attacks Purus (another 
  Western Indian kingdom), he needs the alliance of two other kingdoms of India. 
  Ambhi, King of Taksh Shila made alliance with Alexander (was this alliance 
  made before Alexander entered India?). Another king Shashi Gupta also entered 
  into alliance. They were enemies of Purus. It took the three kings to finally 
  defeat Purus, in a very hard battle. As he proceeded eastwards, he was daunted 
  by greater tasks and his army had lost its morale, forcing him to turn back. 
  As mentioned earlier, he probably did not want to meet with the organized 
  armies of the independent Indian empires of Magadh, Gangariday and Prasoi.<br>
  <br>
  At the end of his adventure, Alexander had conquered the states of Kekaya,&nbsp;Gandhara 
  and Punjab in Northwest India. During the subsequent centuries, Indo-Greek 
  trade picked up. Along with trade of goods, ideas were exchanged. Indian 
  astrology was influenced by the Greeks. The Indians adopted the 12 Zodiac 
  signs. Indian philosophy and science also permeated into Greek culture at the 
  same time.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <b>Age of Empires: Mauryan Empire</b><br>
  <br>
  The Mauryan Empire owes its name to Mura, mother of Chandra Gupta. Mura was a 
  lower caste woman and Chandra Gupta was the illegitimate son of her and the 
  Magadhan king. According to legend, the Nanda King, Dhananda, who ruled during 
  the time of Alexander's invasion had an illegitimate son by a Shudra (lower 
  caste) woman called Mura. When Alexander came to India, Chandra Gupta had met 
  him as a young man and through him, Alexander probably learned of 
  the&nbsp;organized armies of the East. Two years after Alexander departed, Chandra 
  Gupta started a war against his father. He was aided in this by his Guru and 
  foster father, Bishnu Gupta, who is popularly called Kautilya or Chanakya. 
  Kautilya is the writer of the Artha Shastra, the first great political 
  treatise of the world. In 322 BC, Chandra Gupta became the Emperor of Magadh 
  and Bishnu Gupta became his able Prime Minister. Chandra Gupta extended his 
  empire as far west as the Indus (Sindhu) river in modern day Pakistan, 
  recovering much of India that was&nbsp;lost to foreign invasions of the Persians 
  and the Greeks. In 305 BC, the Greeks, under Alexander's general Selucas (then 
  king of Babylon), returned and met Chandra Gupta in battle. This time they did 
  not face a provincial king of Western India but an emperor from Eastern India. 
  Selucas was defeated. Chandra Gupta, however, was very generous with the 
  defeated general, and only took parts of Selucas' land as compensation and 
  even gave 500 elephants as a gift. He also married Selucas' daughter thereby 
  creating an alliance. The nature of the alliance is not known but given the 
  nature of ancient India's political overlord ship, Selucas probably ruled an 
  independent kingdom under the Mauryan empire. From Megasthenes, a Greek 
  ambassador at Chandra Gupta's court, we learn that this new empire was 
  extremely oranised, much like modern states of today. Chandra Gupta's capital, 
  Pataliputra (now known as Patna, in Bihar, India) was the greatest city. It 
  was certainly the largest city as well. In this empire even certain central 
  villages were fortified. The first great highway of history was built that 
  still exists today as the Grand Trunk Road. The road was flanked by trees and 
  milestones. One of the first great secret services was also born here under 
  the guidance of Kautlya. People from all rank and file were included in the 
  service. Even the emperors of this empire would go out in disguise to see the 
  needs of the city.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Towards the end of his life, Chandra Gupta had abdicated his throne in favor 
  of&nbsp;his son and had gone to Belgola, Mysore with a Jain sage. The Jain sage had 
  predicted drought and famine correctly. At Belgola, he fasted till death, 
  entreating the Gods to end the drought.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  His son, Bindusara, ruled in relative peace from the Hindu Kush to Mysore. 
  Kalinga (present day Orissa) was outside his rule though. At this time India 
  had peaceful relations with the Syrians and the Greeks. Then came, in 276 BC, 
  the great Ashok son of Bindusara who litterally conquered all India. He was 
  probably the greatest king to have ever ruled in this world. Not the size of 
  his empire but the noble ideals of this man made him great. Pillars 
  proclaiming him as a just and wise ruler exist all over India. In Gandhar (Afganistan) 
  and other western areas, the inscriptions are in Greek as opposed to Brahmi 
  that was the script of India. These show that the Greek rulers in the 
  northwest were his subordinates. Ahsok had become a Buddhist and was a very 
  peaceloving just king who was also the first ecologically concerned king. He 
  set up the first animal preserves in the world.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  However, he started out as a hungry conqueror. On the ninth year as emperor he 
  attacked Kalinga (Orissa), one of the last Drabir nations on the North East, 
  other than Bangla. (NOTE: Anga, Banga, Kalinga are classified together 
  possibly due to their common heritage.) The battle that ensued was one of the 
  most memorable and toughest of ancient India. Ashok won but was deeply 
  affected by the carnage. Ashok was aghast at his own doing. He only found 
  relief in Buddhism and thus marked the making of a new Ashok, a man of peace. 
  He dedicated the rest of his life to public welfare. He sent missionaries to 
  spread Buddhism to Greece, Egypt and Sri Lanka. Ashoka died as the first 
  people's emperor in 272 BC, who believed&nbsp;love to be superior to war.<br>
  <br>
  The Mauryan empire was the greatest of all Indian empires. The greatest extent 
  of the empire under emperor Ashok stretched as far north as Tashkent, in 
  modern day Uzbekistan, including Afganistan and covered part of Iran and 
  Tajikistan to Myanmar in the East. Remnants of this are still visible. It can 
  be observed in the Indian names still existing from east Asia to central Asia. 
  Tashkent is the corruption Taksha Khand and Quandahar is the corruption of 
  Gandhaar. It is important to note here that originally Afganistan (Upa-Gana-Stan) 
  was an integral part of India. There are other Indian names even further west. 
  Pundra Bardhan (West Bangla) and Anga (Bangla) were part of the Mauryan empire 
  but it is however, not sure if all of Bangla was in the Mauryan empire. As 
  mentioned earlier, it might be that the other Banglas retained their 
  independence. Bangla port Tamralipti introduced the landlubber Mauryan 
  emperors' to seafaring. Ashok's descendants, for various reasons, which 
  include pacifism, saw the decline of the empire. Finally the Mauryan empire 
  ended violently in 185 BC. In 185 BC, an army commander in chief, Pushya Mitra, 
  assasinated the last Mauryan emperor during a parade of his troops. Some 
  suggest this was a reaction of Brahmins against the highly Buddhist rulers.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Chaos</b><br>
  <br>
  Pushya Mitra returned many of Brahmins to power. He also allowed the killing 
  and sacrificing of animals. It was a return to strict Hindu religion. Pushya 
  Mitra was not, however, to enjoy his rule long in peace. Within two years of 
  the fall of the Mauryan emperors, once again came the invasion of foreigners. 
  The King of Bactria, Demetrius, who was probably subordinate under the 
  Mauryans, invaded and conquered the North West Indus region. Further 
  encroachment was stopped by Pushya Mitra in a series of Indo-Greek wars. 
  Pushya Mitra ruled for 36 years and was not a bad ruler. His reign saw the 
  mark of intellectual fermentation. Patanjali, the great grammarian lived in 
  this period. Art and literature also further developed. PushyaMitra never 
  assumed the title of emperors but founded the Sunga dynasty. During Sunga 
  reign the Mauryan empire reverted to the old Magadhan empire and the Sungas 
  were ardent patrons of the Hindu. They persecuted Buddhists and destroyed many 
  Buddhist stupas. However, they were not totally intolerant of Buddhism shown 
  by the facts that the Buddhist stupa at&nbsp;Sanchi was enlarged and the great 
  stupa at Bharhut was erected during the Sunga period. The Sunga rulers caused 
  the empire to break up into different kingdoms with their in-fighting.<br>
  <br>
  The last Sunga king, Deba Bhumi, was killed by his minister, Basu Deb in about 
  75 BC. The Kanva dynasty ruled after that for a short period till 30 BC, when 
  they were overthrown by the Andras (originally Drabir). This marks the 
  beginning of a period of chaos that was to last for three hundred years. 
  During this period, the Indo-Greek Buddhist Kings set up independent states in 
  the northwest. Soon they were replaced by Central Asian tribes of Shakas 
  (Scythians?) and Pahalavas. These people promptly got absorbed into Indian 
  culture. The Kushanas followed also from Central Asia. They established a 
  great Buddhist empire in the west stretching from Kabul to Banaras. They too 
  had become Indianized while adding to Indian culture significantly. This 
  empire spread Mahayana Buddhism all over the world. The empire existed even in 
  the 2nd century AD.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Around 200 BC, the Satabahanas emerged from Maharastra. They ruled Maharastra, 
  Madhya Pradesh and even regions of South India. Gautamiputra&nbsp;<br>
  Satakarni of the Satabahanas defeated the Shakas and his empire stretched from 
  Kathewad, Malwa and Rajasthan in the north to the river Krishna in the south 
  and from the Arabian Sea in the west to the Bay of Bangla in the East.<br>
  It should be noted that towards the end of the Mauryan Empire, Kalinga had 
  once again become powerful and had thrown off the Mauryan rulers. Kalinga 
  became extremely powerful under Kharabela and conquered the Southern India, 
  whose history is not known very well. He even defeated Agni Mitra, son of 
  Pushya Mitra and had sacked the capital of Magadha.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Guptas</b><br>
  <br>
  Bangla history in this period between the Mauryan rule and Gupta rule (the 
  next great empire) is not known clearly. However, we know from the Greek 
  sources, mentioned above, that the Gangaridai and the Prasoi empires continued 
  to exist in this period. They probably retained independence through the 
  Mauryan Empire. This is also the period when Bangla became Buddhist. By the 
  time the Guptas enter Bangla, it is predominantly a Buddhist nation. Before 
  the Guptas, Bangla history probably became more connected with Eastern Asia 
  more than India (except probably Kalinga). During this period it appears that 
  the Bangalees spilled into Burma, Thailand and all the way to Vietnam. The 
  Mons of Thailand and Burma were dominated by Bangla / Kalingas. Their history 
  also was probably more connected to Indonesia whose ancient script is very 
  similar to Proto-Bangla. And maybe they kept connection with Sri Lanka.<br>
  <br>
  North India remained divided and the west was once again under foreign rule 
  until the rise of the Guptas. In the south, however, powerful empires rose to 
  prominence. Chera (Kerala), another ancient sea-faring nation of South West 
  coast of India, who might also be descended from the Indus civilization, at 
  this time traded with the Romans as they had with the Greeks and the Jews and 
  Egyptians earlier. Out of the chaos in North India, rose a new Chandra Gupta 
  in 320 AD. He married the Lichabi princess, Kumara Debi. Kumara Debi was the 
  heiress to the throne thus bringing Chandra Gupta to power. The Lichabi 
  republic once annexed by Magadh now annexed Magadh and created a new empire 
  under the Gupta dynasty. Once again Magadha became the centre of the empire. 
  Under Samudra Gupta, son of Chandra Gupta, the empire was further extended. He 
  recovered the Western India and extended his rule to the South of India as far 
  as Sri Lanka. The south was not conquered but subordinated by treaties. The 
  Gupta era is called the Golden Age of India. India became the leader of all 
  spheres of life in this period. Some of the greatest architecture and art 
  comes from the Guptas. The most powerful of the Southern empires were Bakataka 
  empire (250 - 500 AD). The Gupta's never conquered them and ended up making a 
  treaty.<br>
  <br>
  In the early phase of Gupta expansion, they defeated Bangla and annexed her. 
  Two Barmans kings of Bangla are defeated. This is the first mention of the 
  Barmans. As Bangla came under their rule, Tamralipti again served as a major 
  port. Once again under the Guptas, India became a great nation, in strength, 
  culture, spirituality and science. The first wave of Hun invasions were 
  defeated by the Guptas so convincingly that they decided to give up their 
  plans to invade India for decades, turning their attention to the Roman 
  empire, devastating her. Were these Barmans the emperors of the Gangaridai and 
  Prasoi empires? The Barmans as will be seen are very active throughout Indian 
  history. They come from Drabir lines as in Bangla, and South India. Were the 
  Barmans big players in the ancient Indus civilization?<br>
  <br>
  <b>Post Gupta North India&nbsp;</b><br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Guptas came to an end around the 5th century AD after being weakened by 
  the Huns and the Kanauj ruler Yasho Dharma. This was a very chaotic period in 
  all India as well as Bangla. Rapid changes took place in lordship across all 
  India. Different subordinate states around the Gupta empire started declaring 
  independence. .<font color="#800000">.&quot;Indian cities are prosperous and 
  stretch far and wide. There are&nbsp;many guest houses for travelers. There are 
  hospitals providing free&nbsp;medical service for the poor. The bihars and temples 
  are majestic.&nbsp;<br>
  People are free to choose their occupations. There are no&nbsp;restrictions on the 
  movement of the people. Government officials and&nbsp;soldiers are paid their 
  salaries regularly. People are not addicted&nbsp;to drinks. They shun violence. The
