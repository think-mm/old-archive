  Britons to help save abused women from execution by hanging and stoning </b>
  </font></p>
  <p align="center"></p>
  <p align="center"><b>David Smith </b></p>
  <p>Sunday December 19, 2004 </p>
  <p><b>The Observer </b></p>
  <p></p>
  <p align="justify">Two women convicted of crimes against morality in Iran are 
  facing imminent execution, one by being buried up to her chest and stoned, 
  Amnesty International said last night. </p>
  <p align="justify">One of the women, a 19-year-old with a mental age of eight 
  who was forced into prostitution by her mother, is to be flogged and executed. 
  An official said yesterday he was waiting for orders on whether to stone or 
  hang her. The other woman was convicted of adultery and is due to be stoned to 
  death this month in accordance with Iran's severe penal code. </p>
  <p align="justify">Amnesty issued an urgent warning that time was running out 
  for both women and urged the international community to tackle Iran over its 
  executions of women and child offenders. In August another mentally ill girl, 
  16-year-old Atefeh Rajabi, was hanged in a street for having sex before 
  marriage. </p>
  <p align="justify">The 19-year-old, known as 'Leyla M', was a prostitute by 
  the age of eight and was raped repeatedly, according to a Tehran newspaper 
  report. She gave birth when aged nine and was sentenced to 100 lashes for 
  prostitution at about the same time. When she was 12 her family sold her to an 
  Afghan to be his 'temporary wife', while her mother became her new pimp, 
  'selling her body without her consent', the report said. </p>
  <p align="justify">At 14 she became pregnant again, receiving a further 100 
  lashes before giving birth to twins. When her temporary marriage ended, her 
  family sold her again, to a 55-year-old man who was married with two children 
  and did not object to Leyla's clients coming to his house. </p>
  <p align="justify">Last month, Leyla, appearing at a court in the central 
  Iranian city of Arak, was sentenced to death on charges of 'acts contrary to 
  chastity' by controlling a brothel, having intercourse with blood relatives 
  and giving birth to an illegitimate child. The sentence has now been passed to 
  the supreme court for confirmation. She apparently 'confessed' and faces being 
  flogged before being executed. </p>
  <p align="justify">Iran has executed at least three child offenders in 2004 
  and 11 others are believed to have been sentenced to death, according to 
  Amnesty. Under the penal code, girls as young as nine and boys as young as 15 
  can be executed. </p>
  <p align="justify">Interviewed by an Iranian journalist in her cell, Leyla was 
  asked if she understood she was to be put to death. 'Yes, that's what they are 
  saying,' she replied. 'But people in prison say this is a lie. They want to 
  frighten you a bit. </p>
  <p align="justify">'I haven't done anything. My mother told me to go to a 
  man's house and I did. If she said don't, I wouldn't have. I was frightened. 
  If I didn't listen to her, she would have harmed me. She beats me - my father, 
  too.' </p>
  <p align="justify">Asked when she was first forced to have sex, Leyla said: 'I 
  was eight, the first time my mother took me to a man's house. It was a 
  horrible night. I cried that night. Cried a lot. The day after she [my mother] 
  came after me and took me home and bought chocolate and crisps for me.' </p>
  <p align="justify">Leyla has been robbed of the consolation of spending time 
  with her children. 'We used to play together before I went to prison. For some 
  time they were with my mother and then they went to my father. I don't know 
  where they are at the moment.' </p>
  <p align="justify">She said of her father: 'He is a very bad-tempered man. He 
  frightens me. But I liked him when he bought me goodies.' </p>
  <p align="justify">Asked if her mother had visited her on death row, Leyla 
  said: 'No, she hasn't. If you see my mother, tell her that she promised to 
  bring me crisps and chocolate. Also tell her not to forget my red dress.' </p>
  <p align="justify">Campaigners in Iran are compiling a petition against the 
  execution, which they will present to the United Nations. Another group, the 
  International Committee Against Stoning, is to meet officials of the European 
  Union tomorrow in an attempt to build diplomatic pressure on Iran over the 
  imminent execution of Hajieh Esmailvand, whose sentence for adultery was 
  upheld by the supreme court and changed from death by hanging to death by 
  stoning, before Tuesday. The man with whom Hajieh had the affair, who was 17 
  at the time, has been sentenced to death by hanging. </p>
