  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Born into a Hindu family, from my 
  childhood, I have been curiously observing Sanskrit chanting of ‘Mantras’ for 
  virtually any event of Hindu life, birth, marriage and shradha (ritual for the 
  peace of the deceased). Though I never understood a single high pitched 
  chanting of the sloka, it was quite clear, every ceremony was a kind of 
  sacrificial ritual where the Fire-god ‘Agni’ is invited as witness ( by 
  burning a small firewood in the middle of the ceremony ) and sacrifice is 
  offered to different Gods, Goddess and ancestors. Only words that resound my 
  memory till today—a priest always raises his voice high in uttering two 
  words-“ Bed (Veda), Bedanta”. Soon we reach primary school, we learn about 
  Aryans as our ancestors and RG Veda as our ritual heritage—ours is thousands 
  of thousands year old rituals based on God’s revelation of knowledge in RG 
  Veda, so was told! Then in class nine, we learn about Aryan Invasion Theory ( 
  AIT) propounded by Max-Muller and aboriginal theory of Aryan origin by some 
  Hindu historians. So for the first time, we learned Aryans were nomadic tribes 
  from Caucasian because of description of flora &amp; fauna of RG Veda, their 
  anthropological similarity with Caucasian tribes and similarity of Sanskrit 
  with Latin ! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We also learned that the ‘Dasa’, the 
  people defeated by Aryans, become present days Sudra. However, AIT can not 
  explain why Aryans were so good in Chariot war and therefore, some Hindu 
  historians &amp; zealots like Devendra Swarup, Dyananda Swaraswati etc. put 
  forward a conspiracy theory of 19th century Indologists like Max-Muller or 
  Prof Willson to undermine Indian heritage ! We are proud that Hinduism came 
  from India..So was told by them! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fortunately, true father of Indian 
  nation, Neheru was also a true student of history and always kept these stray 
  elements of fanatic Historians from the school books. So we learned some 
  ‘truth’ but in school text books, we didn’t learn much about RG Veda except 
  for a ‘mythical’ Vedic society— </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">• A society where Men and Women were 
  equal in every action • Hymn of RG Veda are the oldest in the world, and 
  reveals the most perfect form of prosaic poetry • ‘Varnashram’..Brhamcharya 
  (celibate student life), Garhastha (family life), Banapastra ( post-family 
  life) and Sanyas (monks who lives in the forest, isolated from family life ) 
  are the most ideal form of evolution of human life. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So like millions of Hindu children, my 
  respect for Veda as supreme spiritual guidance and my ego of Hinduism as the 
  highest form of ancient wisdom continued unquestioned. After all everybody 
  wants to be proud of their heritage. Even though I was always an atheist 
  (non-believer of God), I was confident that Veda is the source of all 
  religious concepts—dualism and non-dualism as I was told. Occasionally, I 
  tried to pick up a Bengali translation of RG Veda and after reading a very 
  first few hymns on Agni, I used to feel confused. Those intangible hymns were 
  not for my age, so was my consolation for failure! How did I know even today, 
  I would not understand many of those hymns because they are truly confusing, 
  non-coherent and a collection of few un-correlated words that can be 
  interpreted in any way we want! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My Hindu friends were busy passing in 
  the examinations and for them, Hinduism is equated to resisting Islamists who 
  are responsible for all kinds of troubles on the earth! The feeling was 
  univocal, irrespective of a Hindu CPI or Congress party member ! Only thing 
  they can discuss about religion is the criticism of cruel Islam ! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What are about Veda and Vedanta then? 
  Oh yes! Hinduism was so great then and that’s why we have superior heritage 
  over Islam! You see that’s why we are so educated and they are not! </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then, there were followers of Santan 
  Dal, disciples of Balak Brhamachary, founder father of ‘Vedic Socialism’. Why 
  not Marxist socialism? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“ Communist Socialism transforms a man 
  into an animal “ </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Every train station in West Bengal was 
  full of this kind of graffiti in the support of Vedic socialism by Santan Dal. 
  Bharatiya Janata Party and Bishya Hindu Parishad were microscopically visible 
  in our school days and for every of such Hindu party, Vedic socialism was the 
  utopian political system of the glorious past where as the Marxist socialism 
  is the cruelest of the political systems of the west. Only if they knew, both 
  Marxist socialism and so called ‘Vedic socialism’ are tied to the same root “ 
  Nomadic Tribal Society” ! Only difference is, Marx followed a true objective 
  method of social science while Nomadic Aryans composed some obscured hymns to 
  leave the discovery of socialism to their modern successors like Balak 
  Brahmachary and MuraliMonahar Joshi. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So the influence of myth of Vedic 
  society continued abated. No question was ever raised. Even not by the ruling 
  Communist party, CP(I)M. They are truly a busy party managing numbers and 
  beliving in democracy of numbers. So Das Capital and RG Veda become 
  simultaneous source of inspiration of socialism for Bengali intellectuals. 
  Ramakrishna Math and Bharat Sevashram, the two most celebrated institutions 
  for modern Bengali elites fueled to the same imagination of myth of Vedic 
  society. Such strong is the influence of the myth, that, in Southern 
  California, local American intellectuals formed ‘Vedanta Society of Southern 
  California” with four large monastery, with each of them worth more than tens 
  of millions of dollar in real estate—Trabuco Canyon Monastery holds 1200 acres 
  of land occupying a whole hill of two miles of circumference! ( I must confess 
  in USA, they are my only source of Hindu literature and I am indebted to them 
  for providing their library ) </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, I never took serious interest 
  in RG Veda till 1999. In September,1999, I went to Polytechnique di Turino, 
  Italy for a couple of months. City of Turin is the second most holiest place 
  for the Roman Catholics after Rome. I started living in a Catholic hostel 
  equipped with rare collections of books on Christianity. So, I decided not to 
  leave this opportunity to learn Catholic literature but my barrier was 
  language. So, I started learning Latin oriented Italians. Though I was aware 
  of Indo-European language, language of RG Veda as the mother of Latin and 
  Sanskrit, I never faced this reality. Striking similarity of Latin roots with 
  Sanskrit like ‘Primo = = Pratham’ ..” Duo= = Dwi “..” Tre = =Tree”..and so on, 
  made me realize roots of the Aryans. So, I started taking interest in Aryan 
  Invasion Theory and RG Veda purely from linguistic point of view. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Meanwhile India was going through a 
  forced Hinduization in the institute of learning thanks to Murali Monahar 
  Joshi, then HRD minister of India. He was ex-departmental head of Physics in 
  Allahabad University. His ex-PhD student Dr. Anil Kumar who was my Professor 
  in IIT-Kharagpur Physics department, had a lot of ‘interesting recollection’ 
  on his ‘Guru’. Since it was a private talk between me and Prof. Kumar, I do 
  not want to get into that, but M.M.Joshi was determined to impose a Vedic 
  society in India and his first target was the higher institutes of learning 
  like IIT, IIM etc. In order to glorify and legitimize the imposition of a 
  Vedic society, he went on stating proverbial lies like ‘Goeler’ –‘ Sabi Bade 
  Ache’ [ famous sarcasm by scientist Prof Meghnad Saha]. He compared ‘Maya’ 
  with Heisenberg’s uncertainity principles, Astrology with Grand Theory of 
  Relativity and endless comparison to impress common Hindu mass. Since, common 
  mass do not understand physics but they know that M.M.Joshi is a Professor of 
  Physics, they too tend to believe in the glory of Veda. But how do you tell 
  them that Prof. Joshi’s PhD &amp; knowledge in Physics itself is questionable and 
  there is no natural science in any of the ancient scripture! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So Vedic myth is no more just a topic 
  of scholarly discussion but a serious hypothesis that will determine the 
  future of India. So as a responsible citizen of India, it became my duty to 
  expose the Vedic myth to fight for our future! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So what did I understand in RG Veda?
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Between 10-20% of the hymns are 
  intangible. RG hymns reveal a polytheist dualistic religion that is common to 
  all the tribal faiths…There is God for everything: For War, it is Indra, for 
  prosperity, it is Agni, for fear Yama etc. There is no concept of atheism in 
  RG Veda. Just a normal pagan religion of tribals based on war, fear, greed for 
  wining golds, women etc. There is a huge number of hymns that indicate that 
  Aryans used to drink wine ( ‘Soma’) heavily before prayer to Lord Indra 
  because Indra was also a legendary alcoholic with passion for women like a 
  typical Afgan Warlord ( geographically, it is highly possible that he was 
  indeed an Afgan Warlord who killed thousands of local dark colored tribes who 
  have been mentioned as ‘Dasa’ in RG Veda ). There is no trace of higher 
  spiritualism in RG Veda, it is squarely a collection of rituals to please 
  their Gods and maintain a society. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How was the society? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Again, tons of Hymns have been 
  dedicated to show how much they used to hate these dark colored people ‘Dasa’ 
  and how proud they are to make them slave and snatched their wives. So, before 
  they will attack a local ‘Dasa Tribe’, they will chant praising Indra (similar 
  to praising Allah before Jihad ) </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Eager for booty, craving strength and 
  horses, we-singers stir Indra, the stray for friendship, </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">who gives the wives we seek, whose 
  succors fails not, to hasten, like a pitcher to the fountain” --Hymn XVII(17) 
  To Indra </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What they prayed to Indra in this 
  hymn? Writer is saying Aryan warriors were always craving for strength and 
  horses—all that matter in ancient war tactics. And what is the biggest reason 
  for this attack ? So that they can confiscate wives of the other tribes by 
  killing their men. Yes, women, fertile women were the biggest booty of the war 
  that Aryans have always craved. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What’s about the gold then? </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“ And now to Vasa, Asvya here This 
  stately woman is led for the Adorned with mammoth of gold” -Hymn XLVI (22) To 
  Indra </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course when an Aryan wins a war, he 
  gets a woman to get laid with her gold as additional bonus. And if this lady 
  is wife of any leader, return is even higher! “ Mammoth of gold”. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sometimes, even Dasa used to take 
  their revenge. They will abduct Aryan women as well. So, Indra will be called 
  for rescue operation. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Women for weapons hath the Dasa 
  taken, What injuries his feeble armies do to me? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Well he distinguished his two 
  different voices And Indra then advanced to fight Dasya” -Hymn XXX[9] </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What’s about myth of women poet ? Like 
  Gargi and twenty other women composers of RG Veda? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Remember, RG Veda is not like Bible or 
  Koran. It is just a collection of rituals with hymns. Since, ritual should 
  always be practiced by a man and his wives, obviously there should be hymns to 
  be recited by women folk as well. So, existence of women authors of RG Veda is 
  natural just because it is a collection of rituals for their wives as well. 
  However, I must agree, that they were more free about their sexual need even 
  by today’s’ standard. Sometimes, they posed first feminist question on the 
  earth like this hymn </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Neither in thy decree, nor mine, but 
  Is another he delights – The man who brought us into this” --Hymn XXXIII (16) 
  To Indra </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Above composition by a woman author is 
  just terrific! This is an eternal complain of a woman against a man whom she 
  loves! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And how a man replied to her complain 
  in the next hymn? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Indra himself hath said, The mind of 
  woman brooks not discipline, Her intellect hath little weight” -Hymn 
  XXXIII(17) </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What a male chauvinistic answer by a 
  warrior Aryan to a finest composition by a woman ! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I can go on and on to show that women 
  were treated no better than a property and were taken as one of the wives when 
  her husband would be defeated. However, she had sexual freedom to the extent 
  of demanding lesbian and animal sex publicly when her husband would be away in 
  war. Also, she was free to compose finest of poetry though men paid little 
  attention to her finest sensitivity. An eternal story! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But as you can see, we, the successors 
  of Aryan civilization do not need to be proud or to be ashamed of Vedic 
  society. It was a prehistoric tribal society that followed the historical 
  standards of their time. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, no ground be granted to 
  M.M.Joshi or Balak Bramhachary or people like Hitlar to satisfy their vested 
  interest in the name of Vedic/Aryan Society.</font></p>
