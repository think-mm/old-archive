  <p align="center">Dec 24, 2004</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On day of 9/11, I was heading towards 
  NewYork City and by the time, I crossed NeYork Penn station, I was struck by 
  the huge fumes of ashes that was covering the sky. By 11 AM, the whole city 
  was gripping under by a deep thick cover of smoke and for 15 minutes nothing 
  was visible. Then, I witnessed the biggest tragedy of our life time before my 
  eye--so much, so bad were the eyes of the waiting mothers and wives in the 
  stations of NJ Transit, I still do not have enough mental power to describe 
  the disaster of the day. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the next day, I received my first 
  hate call in USA..&quot;You motherxxx..&quot;..I tried to interrupt the old lady and 
  tell her that I am an Indian born Hindu, but she didn't know what I was 
  talking about. Then I realized, 80-90% of the American thinks, every body that 
  looks like a middle-eastern complexion, is a Muslim and they do not know the 
  existence of Hinduism.But that is typical of American, the most parochial 
  nation on the earth. On 9/13 nite, I was heading towards a bar and I was 
  stopped by the cops which is the first time, I was ever pulled over. First 
  thing, I was asked where I was heading at 11PM? I politely told him that I was 
  going to the bar..Oh! That' great, so you drink..You are not a Muslim then? I 
  told him that he is right. So, he showed me the direction to the bar. His 
  intention was pretty obvious. He was looking for an suspicious Muslim to 
  grill. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I don't know after 9/11, how many 
  times in lunch/dinners and in corporate parties, I had to convince the folks 
  that I eat pork and I drink and therefore be assured that I am not a Muslim. 
  Still many of them, remain suspicious that I am hiding my identity. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since, then I know, how difficult for 
  the educated Muslims to get a white color job in US. My friend who was running 
  a bodyshopping company, told me, he is afraid of placing any Muslim consultant 
  to his clients because they might cancel his vendorship for showing unknown 
  reason. Quite naturally, Muslims who lost their jobs after 9/11, didn't get an 
  equivalent job or are still looking for a job. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have been actively hiring engineers 
  in our division in Anaheim, and I look for thousands of resumes in LA area in 
  Monster website. Many of the Bangladeshi engineers are changing their name to 
  American sounding Christian names to get a job. So Jaher Mohammad can post his 
  resume as John Mathews as well. I interviewed one such guy and asked him for 
  the cause. He is an US citizen of Bangladeshi origin. After he lost his job in 
  a silicon foundry six months back, he didn't get an interview yet. So, he 
  decided to change his name in the resume. Many similar stories follow later. 
  One of my excollegue Sufian who was laid off in Dec,2001, started working in 
  his brother's restuarant because he could not find anything despite having a 
  PhD from NJIT. Finally he decided to join University of Jordan as a Professor 
  in 2003. His name change to Sufi Abraham from Sufian Abbedrabbo, didn't get 
  him through. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No doubt, Muslims from India and 
  Bangladesh are mostly moderate and some times, more secular than most of the 
  Americans. Many of the illeterate daily laborer Muslims in our village town, 
  are more secular than average Americans. My father had a favorite Muslim 
  contractor, who built our house. I used to call him Bakkar mamu and he never 
  visited any Mosque. He might be a class three or four educated, but he was 
  firm in his conviction that religion feeds him nothing and if he continues in 
  the path of honesty, why Allah would punish him for not going to Mosque? 
  Because if he did punish him for not going to the Mosque, then Allah is as bad 
  as a local 'tolabaj mastan' ( local hooligans who collect their dues by force 
  ). He with his courage deeply influenced me to be an atheist in childhood and 
  I sometimes wonder, I have not found a single lowly educated Americans who can 
  think like him beyond their religion ( highly educated Americans are different 
  story). </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, average Americans can not 
  think like Mr Bakkar and therefore, Muslims will be vanishing from the white 
  color jobs sooner than you can think. </font></p>
