  <p></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Way back then, in the days of the 
  liberation struggle, I remember how badly I wanted to come back to Bangladesh. 
  I remember how emotionally charged I was to see Bengalis fighting against a 
  tyrannical empire and winning their freedom. I remember how my young blood 
  boiled when they mass-murdered the intellectuals and dumped their bodies. I 
  remember how in 1971, I spent time trying to help out the poor, hurt men and 
  women crossing over Benapol to take refuge in West Bengal. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I’ve always been so closely attached 
  with the wholeness of the land of Bengal that an opportunity to be there 
  physically was always on my mind. I knew it was going to happen some day. And 
  it happened, only after waiting for thirty-three odd years. But now in the 
  autumn of 2004, there I was, standing on the soil of free Bangla. A dream 
  finally came true. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yes, I know so far, it sounds like an 
  introduction to one of those typical, corny memoirs. And I don’t make any 
  bones about the fact that just like any average Bengalee, emotion plays deep 
  in me. After all, I am also a product of the top-quality, emotional Bengali 
  intelligentsia – a matter of a lifestyle – that nurtured my existence since 
  when I came to know the world, opened my eyes to it. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;ami chokh mellum akashe, jege uthlo 
  tara, phute uthlo aalo, golaper dike cheye bollum sundar, sundar holo she.&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">- Tagore </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(I woke up in the sky stars bloomed 
  lights sprouted I said to the rose, &quot;beautiful&quot; and it became so) </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My senses developed breathing in 
  Bangla language, imbibing in Bangla culture, to imbue in its music, poetry, 
  film, drama, tarja, jatrapala, and all. Rabindranath, Nazrul, Jibanananda, 
  Lalan, Satyajit, Nati Binodini, Jahir Raihan. The Vaishnava, Islam, Buddhism, 
  Brahma, atheism and socialism. The Sufis and the Sadhaks. The kirtans, 
  shyamasangeets, bhawaias and bhatialis. The Marxism, Maoism, secularism and 
  Bhasha Andolan. The Titumir, Kano-Sidho, Birsa, Khudiram, Subhas Bose, Bhasani, 
  Tebhaga, Naxalbari, the Six-Point Programme and 1971. An open society and 
  free-thinking lifestyle. The quest for truth and the courage to challenge and 
  question the unfounded. It’s the history of struggle for more than a thousand 
  years. It’s the history of an incredible development of the human mind. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe people who don’t understand 
  how full of movements – social, political, religious, literary – our heritage 
  and histories are and how much we love our rights to stand up for 
  progressiveness and against injustice, lies and prejudice just don’t get 
  Bengalihood – Bangalitwa. It doesn’t matter if you grow up in Dhaka, Sylhet, 
  Kolkata, Nadia or Noakhali. It doesn’t matter if you grow up in London, New 
  York or Bonn. If you get Bengalihood, you get it anywhere. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, my four days in November, 2004 in 
  Dhaka, Comilla and Chandpur reassured me of my own identity, an identity 
  evolved through this thousand-year-old, vibrant, forwardly changing history. I 
  also saw how a sudden stagnation and the lack of an understanding of this 
  identity are now fast eroding the carefully-built multi-faith, multicultural, 
  humanist foundation of Bengalihood, just the way the once-beautiful embankment 
  at Chandpur’s Padma-Meghna-Dakatia confluence is slipping away and going 
  under. On the other hand, I saw how the on-the-ground, educated Bengalees are 
  still passionate and optimistic to save the land from this rapid erosion. 
  Question is, what exactly is being done to prevent an absolute destruction of 
  our Bengali identity and how effective that plan of action, if any, is. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My fear is that there is no real plan 
  of action that is in place now. A largely right-wing government and a largely 
  fake opposition keep making the matter even worse. A selfish, materialistic 
  lifestyle is taking over our once-egalitarian, spiritual core. Brainwashing 
  courtesy U.S. corporate culture on one hand and Bollywood on the other is 
  rapidly taking over the once-thinking minds of the Bengali youth. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath is still a revered figure 
  in Bangladesh, but perhaps much more so in Dhanmandi, Purana Paltan, Gulshan, 
  Banani or Ramna than in most other cities, let alone villages. Is Nazrul still 
  respected? Of course, but again, more in formally educated Bengali homes. Is 
  Mujib still a father figure? Middle-class visitors to his old Dhanmandi house 
  – now turned into a national museum – are trickling in and watching with awe 
  the relics from the dark August, 1975 days. Is Jibanananda popular? Well, 
  among the poets and their admirers, maybe, but certainly not among the 
  pro-West youth. What about the bards, authors, freedom fighters, filmmakers, 
  and in short, the thousands of people who built the one thousand years of our 
  history? I returned with a deep sense of skepticism: history is not really an 
  important part of the Bangla identity any more. I find that scary. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the movie Matir Moyna, the 
  celebrated Masuds have shown – in a very artisitic and subtle way – how slowly 
  but surely, a generation is rising without any education on Bengalihood. The 
  Masuds’ portrayal seemed so realistic and thus so worrisome. My short visit 
  reaffirmed my apprehension that it was indeed the case. Notwithstanding I was 
  there right after the Eid, witnessing the fact that a vast couple of hundred 
  miles of both rural and urban Bangladesh is taken over by festoons and banners 
  of Madrasas and Mahila Madrasas was not a matter of great comfort. Neither it 
  was a heartening sight to see fundamentalist dogma loudspeaker-hit off 
  numerous rikshaws and vans in the nooks and crannies of small town centers and 
  village haats. Where does this enormous money come from to pay for such huge 
  expenses? Who are the sponsors of these many schools and institutions? Is 
  someone carefully watching over their accounts and activities? Who’s running 
  their well-oiled (and I must say, well-run) hospitals, health- and community 
  centers? Someone needs to keep a close eye on them. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Problem is, Bengali intellectuals and 
  elite liberals do not have time for it. Just like the egocentric, 
  individualistic liberals in India, England or USA, they do not want to get 
  their hands dirty. I’m talking about both Muslims and Hindus of Bangladesh. 
  There are of course exceptions, but these exceptions prove the norm. The 
  fundamentalists and fanatics know it. In Bangladesh, the Jamats and the Oikyo 
  Jot know it, just like the RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad know it in India. 
  They know how to organize and exploit peoples’ minds on the issues of 
  discontent and rich-poor divide. They also know how to use the urban-rural 
  disconnect. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is definitely neither my point that 
  all the Madrasa teachers are against an independent Bangladesh nor do I 
  believe they’re all teaching their students to be pro-Taliban. In fact, just 
  like I’ve experienced the presence of honest, decent people in Hindu right 
  wing RSS and BJP, I know there are thousands of good-hearted Muslims who’re 
  sending their kids to the many Madrasas and other parochial, inexpensive 
  schools and hospitals, mainly because the state with its corrupt system has 
  failed to serve the poor and completely lost their trust about a civil society 
  and government. The rampant violence in broad daylight has only exacerbated 
  this mistrust. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What matters the most is that the 
  open, artistic, musical, harmonious Bengali way of life is being replaced fast 
  by a closed, dark, divisive culture where not just Rabindranath, Bankim or 
  Nazrul, but the concepts of color, art, music, poetry and drama would be 
  banished once and for all. It will not happen overnight, but it is bound to 
  happen unless prevented now. The erosion of the Chandpur embankment has 
  created ample sand and silt and they’ve stopped the flow of riverine 
  Bangladesh, a flow that has always been the lifeline of the land of Bengal, as 
  we know it. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The urban, formally educated Bengali 
  middle class is still happy and complacent. There are scores of quality daily 
  newspapers and magazines that keep churning out old-fashioned yet powerful, 
  secular journalism. Still, to me, it seemed the newspaper- and television 
  producers and editors do not get the extent of the identity displacement. 
  Bengali intelligentsia keeps itself merry with a feel-good, 
  nothing-can-go-wrong mindset. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But things are going wrong. The most 
  important freedom that we have in a free country – freedom to think – is being 
  taken away and we’re not even aware of it. An otherwise bright, fifth grader 
  in Chartha, Comilla is getting addicted to trash Bollywood spy thrillers and 
  wasteful, flamboyant test cricket. His parents happily declare that his idols 
  are now Amitabh Bacchhan and Sachin Tendulkar. It made me take a deep breath 
  and think twice about the direction even an educated, honest, Bengali family 
  in a small town is going. And this is only a tiny part of the big picture.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I remember how I had once been shocked 
  to find out that most graduating students in a New York City-based Bangla 
  school would not even know who Satyajit Ray was and how Kolkata and Dhaka were 
  parts of the same province a little more than half a century ago. A shallow, 
  uninformed mind lacking the abilities to learn and analyze is the fertile 
  ground for sowing the seeds of bias, naivete, self-gratification and 
  backwardness. This is happening in U.S. This is happening in India. I thought 
  I would see things different in free Bangla. I was wrong. </font></p>
