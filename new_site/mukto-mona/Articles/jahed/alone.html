  <span style="font-family:Verdana">Over the course of last few years, I 
  remember, total number of fellow <i>Bangalees </i>with whom I had a chance to 
  discuss several social-political issues related to my country, Bangladesh, 
  will tantamount to a few hundreds, and almost in each cases both the person(s) 
  with whom I discussed those issues and I, myself, reached basically the same 
  conclusion- <i>this country (Bangladesh) has no future!</i> A profoundly 
  pessimistic tone permeated in every such discussion I joined in. However, 
  recently reading a small parable with a root in Sufi version&nbsp; (a more 
  accommodating version of Islam in contrast with <i>Wahaabism</i>) has struck 
  my mind and made me reevaluate many of our easy-to-escape conclusions such as 
  one mentioned above. The parable goes as follows: heavily disheartened and 
  dejected by the chaos and grieves of the world, a man asked the Almighty – 
  “God, you are said to be omnipotent, omniscient, yet so many injustice is 
  happening to your creatures- killings, rapes, corruptions, unnecessary 
  bloodsheds and what not! Can’t you do something?” A big silence continued and 
  then came the reply from the God: “I did something. At least I created you.” 
  After reading this parable, subject of my question was none but myself, and it 
  was: if it so happened that each of us who are so fed up and frustrated about 
  the existing realities of our societies had performed whatever small acts we 
  were capable of, what an amazing</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana">act that would have been! After all, Mahatma 
  Gandhi, Iswar Chandra Vidya Sagar,&nbsp; Sir Syed Ahmed,&nbsp; Rabindranath Tagore, to

  <span style="font-family:Verdana">Needless to say, governments systems in 
  South Asian countries are far below standard in terms of service they provide 
  to the public, transparency and accountability. The politicians, whether in 
  power, or in opposition, are mostly corrupt and use political power more as a 
  tool of making own fortunes than to serve the people. Illiteracy is profoundly 
  felt in South Asian societies and, politicians, government officials at 
  various levels take advantage of this phenomenon in deceiving people. The 
  crucial question, however, is when we know- governments would not live up to 
  our expectations, or for that our social-political infrastructures are not as 
  developed as they are in West, what do we do? Do we have any alternatives? Or, 
  should we give up even our individual roles? To answer this question, I feel 
  tempted to cite a quote <span style="color:black">by
  <span class="HTMLTypewriter2"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Edward 
  Everett Hale: <i>I am only one, but still I am one. I cannot do everything, 
  but still I can do something; and because I cannot do everything I will not 
  refuse to do the something that I can do. </i>Alas! Although, our intention is 
  a noble one, in our criticism of an improper system, barely we remember that 
  each of us has some roles to play in improving our society and its structure. 
  We refuse to act because each of us has been well used to think, I cannot do 
  anything alone. </span></span></span></span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">&nbsp; A few months ago, when I was 
  living amid intense fears and uncertainty in the light of US Immigration &amp; 
  Naturalization Service (INS) having made it mandatory for immigrants of 
  certain countries including Bangladesh to appear for Special Registration 
  program. I lost my student status and hence all fears. What if a cop arrested 
  me now and asked for legal documents?- was a common question I was living 
  with. Exactly, at that time, a simple advertisement in a local paper from a 
  human rights organization, I remember, created a profound sense of security, 
  hope and self-dignity in my mind. The ad informed me that even if I don’t have 
  legal status in this country (USA), I am, however, entitled to certain rights. 
  For example- in </span><span style="font-family:
  Verdana;color:black">New York City</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">, 
  a cop is not allowed to ask for legal documents to an illegal immigrant. I am 
  not obliged to answer questions raised by an INS officer without the legal 
  representation of a lawyer. So knowing my rights boosted my morale at a time 
  of distress. What could be the implication of know-your-rights paradigm in a 
  society such as ours?&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Legend has it- charity begins 
  at home. First thing in averting prevailing corruption, injustice in any 
  society, in my opinion, is to educate oneself about one’s rights as a citizen. 
  If I do not know what rights I am entitled to as a responsible citizen of a 
  country, it is impossible to know when I am deprived of my basic rights. And 
  under such situations, protesting a corrupt action committed by someone is 
  beyond question. Knowing my rights and responsibility would allow me build a 
  safeguard against violations of such rights, whether it’s me, or someone else, 
  is the victim. Let me illustrate it with an example. In US, after a patient is 
  registered in any hospital, a small brochure is handed over to each patient 
  describing the patient’s rights such as rights to know in detail the process 
  of treatments, diagnosis, medications and their possible side effects. If it 
  so occurs that a patient suffers serious side effects due to doctor’s, or any 
  other hospital personnel’s negligence, a patient can sue the doctor /hospital 
  for malpractice, or wrong treatment. This has reduced the incidents of medical 
  malpractice significantly in USA compared to any South Asian country. When 
  even a seriously ill patient knows his/her rights to receive proper treatment, 
  it naturally results in a mental boost of confidence and dignity stemming from 
  the thought- by virtue of being sick one does not become simply a burden on 
  doctors, or hospital staff. At the same time, doctors/nurses also treat a 
  patient with more responsibility and care. Of course, patients also have 
  certain responsibilities such as abiding by doctor’s advices, taking 
  medications regularly and so on. With knowledge about some basic laws one can 
  also help others when a violation occurs. Let me share a true incident I read 
  in an American newspaper sometime ago. With the intention of pure harassment a 
  racist cop once in </span><span style="font-family:Verdana;
  color:black">New York City</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black"> 
  blocked the way of an African American and searched his body in the presence 
  of dozens of passersby. The suspect turned out to be an innocent elderly 
  person. Among those eye witnessing the real life drama was one person who knew 
  it well that the cop had a bad motive behind the search and what he did was 
  totally unlawful. He later met the victim and informed him that the cop could 
  be sued since in accordance with New York state laws, a cop can search a 
  private person only under three circumstances: on the basis of consent of the 
  person to be searched, on the ground of a probable cause, and if the cop has a 
  search warrant. None of these three conditions applied to above-mentioned 
  case. Therefore, the cop was sued. The victim ultimately won the case while 
  the cop was fined and temporarily suspended; hence it became news. The message 
  is simple- if we know the laws, we can easily detect lawbreakers.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">One might argue- what is 
  applicable to American society not necessarily has any pertinence in societies 
  of third world countries such as ours. I would humbly disagree. True that in 
  terms of accountability, transparency, work ethics, our societies are not yet 
  as developed as their Western counterparts, however, that is not enough as a 
  reason for us to give up our own responsibilities. I remember, the former 
  chief election commissioner of India, Mr. T N Seshan, once commented: “ A bad 
  leader is not elected by bad people. A bad leader is elected because good 
  people do not show up during election.” In our society, we tend to be more 
  interested in cursing the system than performing own individual duties, thus 
  making the job of fighting corruption and injustice even more difficult. Let 
  us consider a generic example of corruption. Say, the officer-in charge (O.C.) 
  of local police station is a corrupt person. He accepts bribes to spare 
  criminals from arrests and even if he arrests, he releases them on acceptance 
  of bribe. What should be the role of a private citizen under such 
  circumstances? Is it- keeping quite thinking since one cannot change the 
  corrupt system of whole country, what’s the use in protesting an isolated 
  incident? Let us assume, someone didn’t protest which often happens in our 
  societies. Now let us try to figure out what one could have done. At the 
  minimum level, one could have done things like informing another responsible 
  citizen about the corruption, who could write a letter to the local, or/and 
  national newspapers, or could have had someone do the same. Such measures may 
  not appear as a drastic method to stop the corruption overnight, yet no one 
  could argue- it’s much better to do something than doing nothing. If the 
  publication of a letter in a newspaper from a private citizen fails to draw 
  the attention of the concerned authority, it would, however, encourage other 
  citizens to report the incidents of corruption in a similar manner. There we 
  go! After knowing our rights and responsibilities as a private citizen and 
  those of government officials, it becomes easier to detect corruption and 
  injustice resulting from the violations, but detection is of no use if we 
  cannot take some steps as a preventive measures. And that’s the reporting: 
  informing other responsible sources about the occurrence of corruptions. 
  Although not mentioned in my example, it goes without saying, more often than 
  not, a non-government officials such as a public representative could be also 
  a corrupt and dishonest figure. Once detected, such occurrence should be 
  reported as well, probably with even greater importance since when a leader is 
  corrupt, public has no place to turn to, a very unfortunate yet prevalent 
  situations in our societies. </span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summing up what I have tried 
  to say above, the roles an individual, or a small group can play in averting 
  corruption and injustice in our society is, to put them stepwise, as follows: 
  educate yourself and others about your rights as a responsible citizen, know 
  the extent, limitations and restrictions of power of those you want to fight, 
  detect abuse of power if any, and speak out, protest and report. It might be 
  relevant to quote Nobel Laureate economist Amartya Sen who, after studying 
  famine in several developing countries including </span>
  <span style="font-family:Verdana;
  color:black">Bangladesh</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">, 
  has pointed out that there is a strong correlation between the freedom of 
  press and level of famine in any developing society. What Sen meant is that it 
  has been observed during many famines in developing countries- population died 
  mainly not because there was lack, or shortage of food as we were told, but 
  because people lack money to buy food since food price goes up due to 
  hoardings. It’s like being in the ocean yet with not a single drop of potable 
  water. No doubt, incidents of illegal hoardings and price of food beyond reach 
  are unlikely to be reported by newspapers if they don’t have freedom, which is 
  seen in any authoritarian regime. On the other hand, when press has enough 
  freedom to report injustice and corruption, government cannot easily get away 
  with the responsibility to account for such incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

  <span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember of having been 
  advised by one of my school teachers in Bangladesh: <i>If you eye witness an 
  evil, try to resist, if you cannot, protest, if even that is not possible for 
  you, at least, tell yourself- how much you dislike it; but please, don’t do 
  nothing! </i>It reminds me of a true experience of a German philosopher (I 
  don’t recall his name at the moment) belonging to Hitler’s era. The 
  philosopher, at the beginning of Hitler’s autocratic and anti-Jews policy, 
  didn’t protest thinking he was not a Jew, but a proud German Catholic 
  Christian, as was Hitler himself. The Hitler’s oppression continued and at one 
  point his victims included not only just Jews, but also all those who believed 
  in freedom and democracy. Alas! By the time, the philosopher raised his voice, 
  there was no one to join him. The moral of the story is that each of us must 
  not wait in the face of corruption and injustice until we become the victims 
  ourselves. It should not happen that by the time we realize we should have 
  done something, we might lose the ability to do whatever little things we are
