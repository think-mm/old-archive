  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">Cosmology is the study of the structure 
  universe as a whole.&nbsp; Cosmogony is about the origin of the universe.&nbsp; Man has 
  been intrigued by the questions of cosmology and cosmogony from the beginning 
  of recorded history and not doubt before.&nbsp; Often wrong, but never uncertain, 
  man has believed many incompatible answers.&nbsp; But there have been certain 
  common patterns and rationales in these answers.&nbsp; The variations perhaps 
  reflect differences in the environment, the social order, and the economy of 
  the different civilizations. In this paper I consider only the civilizations 
  of ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece.&nbsp; Before these civilizations arose, 
  men no doubt speculated on the world beyond their immediate experience, but 
  they left no records. </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">Cities first developed around agriculture 
  based on irrigation.&nbsp; In Mesopotamia there was fertile ground that was easily 
  worked and rivers that periodically flooded over their shallow banks and 
  watered the grasses on the surrounding plain.&nbsp; This no doubt suggested the 
  idea of irrigation.&nbsp; Irrigation required planning and cooperation of large 
  numbers of people  and at the same time it provided a lot of food that could 
  support large numbers of people.&nbsp; So the first cities developed around 
  irrigated agriculture in Mesopotamia, along the Nile, and in the Indus river 
  valley.&nbsp; This was a drastic change in the human way of life.&nbsp; From 
  hunter-gatherer to hunter-farmer to herder-farmer the changes were smaller and 
  mainly quantitative  the work and personal relations must have been pretty 
  much the same: family and neighbors = tribe, division of labor by 
  man/woman/child.&nbsp; But the city based on irrigated agriculture would have meant 
  a drastic change in work and relations.&nbsp; Division of labor was more complex 
  with different working classes and different jobs  slaves, artisans, 
  builders, planners, accountants, soldiers, priests, administrators, tax 
  collectors, judges,&nbsp; This necessitated many social inventions: writing and 
  accounting, contracts, laws, and most significant of all, hierarchy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
  was reflected in the gods being promoted from nature spirits and household 
  genies to rulers and creators of the world.</font></p>

line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">The Mesopotamian civilizations of Sumer, 
  Babylon, Cannan, and Judea all had a common concept of the cosmos.&nbsp; First, it 
  was based on water as the fundamental primordial substance.&nbsp; All philosophers, 
  down to the present, have had difficulty with the idea of the world arising 
  from nothing.&nbsp; In modern theories, in which the world includes literally 
  everything, this difficulty is acute.&nbsp; But the ancients seemed content to 
  start with a formless pervasive substance.&nbsp; But why water?&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">Water was a reasoned choice.&nbsp; First, 
  water was essential to life and perhaps even embodied a vital principle.&nbsp; All 
  living things were wet inside.&nbsp; Second, water was the only substance known to 
  the ancients that existed in all three phases; liquid, solid, and vapor.&nbsp; Of 
  course they didnt really know of the existence of water vapor as a gas, but 
  they must have observed that boiling water produced rising steam, that water 
  evaporated, and also that water condensed on cool surfaces as dew.&nbsp; It 
  probably never snowed or froze in Egypt, but from the mountains of northern 
  and eastern Mesopotamia people would have known of snow and ice and how it 
  changed into water.&nbsp; Third, water came both up from under the ground and down 
  as rain.&nbsp; So it was natural to conceive of water as surrounding the Earth 
  (i.e. that part of the world where men dwelt).</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">But the Earth was not flooded, even 
  though it was surrounded by water.&nbsp; So the basic feature of Mesopotamian 
  cosmology was the firmament, or vault of heaven, that created a dry space 
  above the Earth.&nbsp; The Earth was a disk, and the firmament rested on the Earth 
  around its edge  as was obvious to any Mesopotamian scanning the horizon.&nbsp; 
  Beneath the Earth were the waters of the abyss.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Earth had some thickness 
  as was obvious from digging and from caves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the thickness of the 
  Earth-disk was the underworld.&nbsp; So the world looked like figure 1.</font></p>

line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">Although they agreed on this basic 
  cosmology, the various Mesopotamian cultures differed as to details and 
  accounts of how it came to be.&nbsp; The Sumerian cosmogony begins with the 
  primordial sea called, Nammu the mother of all.&nbsp; Nammu creates <i>an </i>
  (heaven) and <i>ki</i> (earth).&nbsp; <i>An</i>, the sky, is a hard metallic shell 
  lies on the earth, <i>ki.</i>&nbsp; The union of <i>an</i> and <i>ki</i> produce&nbsp; 
  Enlil, the god of air, wind, and storm.&nbsp; Enlil lifts <i>an</i> away from <i>ki</i>, 
  filling the space in which humans live.&nbsp; The space is filled with <i>lil</i> 
  (atmosphere).&nbsp; The brighter parts of the <i>lil</i> form the sun, moon, and 
  stars.&nbsp; Enlil also creates all living things.&nbsp; He also invents all the tools 
  used by man and teaches him to use them.&nbsp; But it isnt Enlil that creates man; 
  it is his son Enki.&nbsp; </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">Enki is the god of the abyss (the sea 
  beneath the Earth).&nbsp; He provides the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates  
  which the Sumerians probably supposed to have come from underground.&nbsp; Enki 
  created mankind from clay in the image of the gods.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clay is probably the 
  natural choice since it is what a man could mold into a complex form and it is 
  a mixture of water and other things.&nbsp; The Sumerians also explained why the 
  form of man was the same as that of the gods.&nbsp; Men were supposed to relieve 
  the gods of labor; so it makes sense that they would have the form of gods in 
  order to perform the same tasks.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:150%"><font face="Verdana">There is a related myth in which Enlil 
  and the other more powerful gods had enslaved the other gods and forced them 
  to work for them.&nbsp; The lesser gods rebelled while Enlil slept and demanded 
  relief.&nbsp; Enlil is roused and the there is a negotiation.&nbsp; The goddess Mama 
  (good name!) creates humans in male-female pairs from clay mingled with the 
  blood of the god Illuwe who is sacrificed for the purpose.&nbsp; The humans are to 
  replace the enslaved gods as laborers.</font></p>

  whole genealogy of gods.&nbsp; The new gods were noisy and Apsu complains that he 
  gets no rest either by day or night.&nbsp; This is significant since the gods are 
  still existing in the primordial waters; sun, moon, and earth have not yet 
  been created.&nbsp; This shows that the Babylonians were not aware that day was 
  caused by the sun.&nbsp; They thought of day and night as fundamental and the sun 
  as a mere marker of day.&nbsp; Apsu proposes to kill off the children gods that he 
  and Tiamat have produced.&nbsp; But the gods take measures to prevent this and kill 
  first Apsu and then Tiamat.&nbsp; The latter is accomplished by Marduk who is then 
  the chief god.&nbsp; He splits Tiamats body in two like and oyster.&nbsp; One half 
  becomes the firmament and the other half becomes the Earth.&nbsp; Tiamats spittle 
  provides rain and clouds.&nbsp; Her head becomes mountains and out of her eyes

  as bringing order from chaos; good from evil.&nbsp; As in the Sumerian story, 
  Marduk creates man to labor for and serve the gods.&nbsp; The social as well as 
  cosmic order is ordained by Marduk - to disobey is to invite chaos.&nbsp; The 
  Babylonians had a strong sense of sin and rituals lasting many days were used 
  to expiate it.&nbsp; Completion of the ritual marked a rebirth of the world, new

  form of&nbsp; two different accounts in Genesis.&nbsp; The newer one appears first in 
  the bible, Genesis 1:1 to 2:4.&nbsp; It is referred to as the Preistly or P 
  account.&nbsp; It is very close to the Babylonian account and was probably learned 
  by the Hebrew priests during Jewish captivity in Mesopotamia.&nbsp; It begins with 
  a formless void of water.&nbsp; Yawehs spirit (i.e. breath, like Enlil the air) 
  moves over the waters.&nbsp; He creates night and day; before creating the Sun, 
  just as in the Babylonian myth.&nbsp; He creates the firmament that separates the 
  waters and creates the Earth.&nbsp; He brings forth vegetation first and then 
  produces the Sun, Moon, and stars.&nbsp; After creating all the other living things 
  he makes man and woman and tells them to multiply and dominate the Earth.&nbsp; 
  Here is a significant break from the other Mesopotamian stories.&nbsp; In this 
  version humans are not produced to serve the gods but are given dominion over 
  Yawehs creation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahweh appears sometimes as one of the Canaanite pantheon 
  in place of Baal.&nbsp; He fights with Yam for example</font></p>

  P account, Genesis 2:4  2:23.&nbsp; The order of creation is different.&nbsp; It 
  begins simply by saying Elohim created the heavens and earth  no details.&nbsp; 
  But then he causes the earth to be moistened and he makes man out of clay.&nbsp; 
  After man he creates plants and animals.&nbsp; Man is assigned to tend Elohims 
  garden.&nbsp; Finally, Elohim recognizes man needs help and so he creates woman.&nbsp; 
  Elohim has told the man and woman that if they eat of the tree of knowledge of 
  good and evil they will die.&nbsp; But the serpent, who is wise, tells the woman 
  this is untrue and so she and the man eat from the tree.&nbsp; It turns out that 
  Elohim was lying about the dying (they only die because He drives them out of 
  the garden so they cant eat from the tree of life any more).&nbsp; Interestingly, 
  after eating from the tree and gaining knowledge of good and evil, it seems 
  the first evil they notice is being naked.&nbsp; So the puritanical association of 
  sex with sin goes far back.&nbsp; As some bard put it, Life in Lubbock, Texas 
  taught me two things.&nbsp; One is that God loves you and you're going to burn in 
  hell.&nbsp; The other is that sex is the most awful, dirty thing on the face of the 
  earth and you should save it for someone you love.&nbsp; </font></p>

  in other respects, doesnt make man a slave but instead gives him dominion

  speculated on the nature of the universe.&nbsp; The earliest speculations were 
  still consistent with the mythical world structure.&nbsp; They debated over which 
  of the four elements: earth, air, fire, water was the primordial stuff.&nbsp; Plato 
  (429  347BCE) was impressed by Empedocoles (490  430BCE) discovery that 
  there were exactly five regular solids.&nbsp; He proposed that these were the atoms 
  (though he didnt use that term) of the elements and that therefore was a 
  fifth element, ether.&nbsp; Heavenly objects consisted of ether.&nbsp; Through their 
  study of geometry the Greeks conceived of circles and spheres as the most 
  perfect figures  we would say most symmetric.&nbsp; Platos model of the universe 
  was a radical departure from the early mythical one.&nbsp; He conceived the Earth 
  as a sphere at the center of the world.&nbsp; Aristotle taught that matter had 
  natural motions depending on its composition.&nbsp; The element, earth tended to 
  fall down and to be at rest.&nbsp; So Greek physics explained&nbsp; why the Earth was at 
  the center, the lowest point, of the spherical universe.&nbsp; Air and ether rose.&nbsp; 
  So the heavenly bodies traveled in circles, the most perfect path, around the 
  Earth, as shown in figure 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a radical change in viewpoint.&nbsp; The 
  universe was not animated by beings, but simply followed some laws of cause 
  and effect.</font></p>

  measurements made by the Babylonians to create a quantitative as well as 
  qualitative model. Eratosthones (275  195BCE) measured the circumference of 
  the Earth by traveling to Egypt and measuring the length of the shadow of a 
  staff at noon and comparing that to the length of its shadow in Greece.&nbsp; His 
  value differed from the modern measurement by only 200 miles.&nbsp; He also 
  measured the size of the Sun and the Moon, and their distance from the Earth 
  [Runes&nbsp;&nbsp; Oddly enough this use of precise measurements also prevented a great 
  step forward in cosmology.&nbsp; Aristarchus of Samos (310  230BCE) proposed that 
  the Sun was at the center of the universe and the Earth&nbsp; and other bodies 
  orbited it along circles.&nbsp; Aristarchus theory was ruled out because 
  observation had not found any parallax in the position of stars.&nbsp; At the time, 
  no one could imagine how very far away the stars are so the lack of parallax 
  was taken to show the stars were all the same distance away, on the crystal 
  sphere of the firmament.&nbsp; </font></p>

  lasted less than two centuries.&nbsp; After 100BCE the scientific world view 
  temporarily merged back into religious, mythical world views [Starr 135].&nbsp; 
  Astrology was invented as a way to divining ones fate.&nbsp; This retreat from 
  rationalism was no doubt in part a reaction to military defeats and conquest 
  by the Romans.&nbsp; The Romans took over Greek science, but added nothing to Greek 
  cosmology.&nbsp; The Hellenistic view was relatively unchallenged until the time of

  sphere at the center of a bubble of ether surrounded by the crystal 
  firmament.&nbsp; Things move and change according to their nature  the gods have 
  nothing to do with it.&nbsp; Man is a being between the gods and the animals.&nbsp; His 
  purposes are his own.&nbsp; He aspires to grasp the universe by reason and 
  observation.&nbsp; Although in the west this vision was submerged again in 
  religious myths for over a millennium, it has emerged again as the dominant 
  world view.&nbsp; Let us hope it can be sustained.</font></p>
