  I have no words to express myself for the loss of a massive number of human 
  lives to the tsunami, which originated in the Indian Ocean, a few days ago. I 
  also have no words to convey my sympathy to those who have survived its 
  destructive power, but lost their loved ones as well as all they had in their 
  life. I am, however, confident that the suffering masses of the affected 
  countries will bear their losses with strength and braveness, for these are 
  the two major qualities that have been sustaining humans on earth for 
  thousands and thousands of years. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  Uttering of soothing words is, though, easy enough for anyone, but the fact of 
  the matter is that I myself am having a difficult time while watching all the 
  pictures of death and destructions that the electronic medias of the United 
  States have been flashing across my television screen. Those pictures make me 
  sick and sad; they also make me cry. When these pictures can effect a person 
  who lives thousands of miles away from the places of death and destructions, 
  it should not be difficult for anyone to realize how difficult it is for the 
  very people who once faced death and are now standing on the very ground, 
  which would have become their graveyards, had they, too, been killed by the 
  destructive tides of the fearsome tsunami. It is simply mind-boggling.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  I myself have once faced death at nature’s hand. I have seen with my own eyes 
  human corpses and animal carcasses floating together in ponds and rivers. I 
  have seen how the survivors from nature’s fury ran helter and skelter in 
  search of their dear and beloved ones. I saw how they screamed and wept, with 
  their hands raised towards the heavens, hoping to get direction from the One 
  who lives in one of them to where their lost ones could be found.&nbsp; I have also 
  seen the heart-wrenching cries of mothers over their infants’&nbsp; dead bodies.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  I have also seen, on my television screen, how helpless humans can become when 
  their own kind decides to kill them mercilessly. The destruction of the Twin 
  Towers of New York is what I am referring to here. In their desperate bids to 
  save themselves from the inferno of death, which was caused by the impact of 
  the two aero-planes crashed into the Towers by the so-called humans, many 
  brought death to themselves by jumping out of their sky-high offices. The 
  scream of those, who were desperately trying to escape the carnage, still 
  rings in my ears.</p>

  Despite the fact that mankind suffered from one of their blackest moments over 
  three years ago, yet my mind has not been able to find answers to some of the 
  vexing questions that related to the events of 9/11 till today. Those 
  questions are: How women, infants, children, old and sick, who were abroad 
  those two ill-fated planes, must have felt when they realized that their lives 
  were going to be taken away from them in a few moments’ time?&nbsp; How they must 
  have reacted, when the planes were about to hit the Towers? Did they scream in 
  extreme fear? How they looked when they were screaming? Did their eyes pop up? 
  Did some of them die of heart failures? And how the innocent children must 
  have clung to their mothers’ chests after being overtaken by the fear of the 
  commotion they found themselves in, before their soft and delicate bodies 
  became part of the burned- down and collapsed debris of the Towers?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  While I was in the process of erasing out all the unanswered questions from my 
  mind, the deaths and destructions wrought by the tsunami plunged me once again 
  into a severe agony. I began, once again, to ask myself: Why innocent infants 
  and children as well as their innocent parents should die before their time, 
  and in violent ways? If not nature, then who is responsible for their deaths?
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  If all the humans, and all the aspects of nature are subject to strict and 
  constant oversights by a celestial deity, then how are they able to play 
  havocs to mankind, their possessions and to their surroundings? </p>

  My Muslim background took me back to the teachings of the Quran. According to 
  it, no human being, animal and fauna or flora can either breathe or die 
  without Allah’s permission, nor can anything happen to our earth and to all 
  other things it contains without His specific Order. He destroys those who 
  refuse to worship Him, or disobey His Orders. He has destroyed nations after 
  nations in the past; He is inflicting painful deaths on humans and animals 
  now, and would continue to do so in future as well. While punishing the 
  sinners and the disobedient folks, He does not care a whit, if the innocents 
  also get crushed under the weight of His uncontrollable rage. This He has been 
  doing all the time; the events of 9/11, through which He caused a few humans 
  to unleash a punishment of unimaginable proportion on a multitude of their 
  innocent fellow-beings were one; the chain of destructions caused by the 
  tsunami, at His Order, to human life and property is the latest for all of us 
  to remember. </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  About the natural calamities, Allah claims, in an unequivocal term, the 
  following in the Quran: </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  6:65: “Say: “He hath power to send calamities on you, from above and below, or 
  to cover you with confusion in party strife giving you a taste of mutual 
  vengeance- each from the other.” See how We explain the Signs by various 
  (symbols), that they may understand.”</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  The question is: If Allah Or God is as dreadful, brutal, merciless and 
  insanely egoistic as He says He is, does He deserve our praise in any form and 
  shape? Should the survivors of the tsunami thank Him for the violent deaths 
  their loved ones have suffered at His hand? Should they be grateful to Him for 
  making them companionless and also for making them penniless and destitute?

  History tells us that Genghis Khan and Hallagu etc. never gave life to those 
  they killed. They never rebuilt what they had destroyed at the time of

  I appeal to all the victims of the tsunami to rely solely upon their own 
  strength and resilience for embarking again on the journey of their lives. 
  They should not waste their time and energy on looking to the heavens for 
  help; for it never came from there either in the past, nor is it going to come

  In the name of humanity, I also appeal to all the lucky people of the world to 
  come to the aid of their misfortunate and suffering brothers and sisters with 
  all the help they can muster and salvage them from the wreckage of 
  destruction. We owe a duty to our own conscience. We can sleep in peace, only 
  if we stand up with our helping hands extended to the suffering masses. 
  Failure to do so will always prick our conscience.</p>

  So, let us all come out for extricating the victims of the tsunami out of 
  their extreme crisis, even if they belong to the faiths we believe are 
  frivolous. Let us all do our human duty; in it lies our mental peace and 
  tranquility. Let us not live with our conscience laden with guilt. Let us live 
  with the satisfaction that helping others in distress brings to us. 
  Satisfaction is the prize we should always aspire to win in our lives; so let 
  us win it without any hesitation or wastage of time. </p>

  Time is of the essence for the victims; so let us not procrastinate. We should 
  not let them suffer, when we can render our help to them immediately. 
  Therefore, let us put ourselves beside them and do everything possible for 
  mitigating their sufferings right now. </p>
