  <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/asghar/">Mohammad Asghar</a>
  </font></b></p>
  <p>After creating our earth billions of years ago, Allah decided to create a 
  special land for the habitation of some of His beloved people. To do so, He 
  separated a chunk of land from the African continent and made it drift in the 
  ocean for millions of years. This land eventually reached the Asian continent 
  and collided with the land of what is now called infidel India. </p>
  <p>As planned by Allah, the collision created the Himalayan Range. At His 
  command, the top of the range became the depository of ice and snow. He made 
  them melt. The water that came out of them created some of the greatest rivers 
  of the world. </p>
  <p>At Allah’s direction, these rivers carried a huge quantity of sediments and 
  deposited them into the mouth of a bay. He made the bay, which is now known as 
  the Bay of Bengal, to solidify the sediments into a land, thereby creating a 
  special country, nobody appears to know when, for some of His best creations 
  to live on it in peace and harmony. </p>
  <p>The land thus created by Allah is now known as Bangladesh. Giving the 
  impression of being located between the two spread legs of a giant India, this 
  country sits on a total landmass of approximately 144,000 Sq. Km. Of this, 
  about 36,000 Sq. Km have been used up by over 204 small and large rivers, 
  forests, hills and roads etc.; only about 108,000 Sq. Km of land of this great 
  country of approximately 144 million people is available to them for 
  habitation and cultivation. </p>
  <p>Despite being a small country for a population of 144 million people, the 
  land of this country, gifted by Allah to them, has been supporting their lives 
  without much difficulty. Until some years ago, it accepted only small 
  quantities of food grains from such infidel-inhabited countries as are the 
  United States of America, France and Australia etc., to meet the shortfall of 
  grains its exceptionally fertile land had failed to produce but that was in 
  by-gone days; Bangladesh, always remaining in Allah’s mind, does no more rely 
  on any other country of the world to feed its ever-burgeoning population. </p>
  <p>Allah keeps on blessing this great country of the Bengalis because 
  approximately 130,000,000 of them are true, pure and great Muslims. Though 
  almost all of them do neither know Arabic nor understand what is written in 
  their religious book called The Quran, yet they are more knowledgeable of all 
  the percepts, rituals and doctrines of their faith than are the Arabs of Saudi 
  Arabia in whose language, and following whose culture and traditions, Allah 
  had given this Book to their beloved Prophet. Because of their unquestionable 
  dedication to Islam, Allah had been showering His blessings on the land of 
  Bengal from the time their ancestors accepted Islam. Some of His blessings are 
  also known as “Famine.” The earliest famine in Bengal region is recorded in a 
  stone inscription found at Mahasthangarh near Bogra in the third century BC. 
  Another famine known as the Great Bengal Famine occurred in 1943. It was one 
  of the worst famines to have ever struck this region. A series of crop 
  failures beginning from 1938 and other disruptive events accompanying the 
  Second World War precipitated this famine. Interruption of normal imports of 
  food grains from Burma due to its fall to the Japanese, dislocation of trade, 
  irregular movement of food grains due to the war in the East, and building up 
  of provincial and district barriers (cordons) against the movement of grains 
  and other essential supplies, increased demand for food to meet the want of 
  the army were some important factors that caused the famine of 1943. The 
  famine of 1943 was Great because Allah tasted His favorite people this time 
  with great woes and travails. Thirty-one years later, He again tasted them in 
  1974 with another famine. Being resolute Muslims, they recovered from it many 
  years later. After that visit of His with famine, He kept on visiting them 
  with floods, cyclones and tidal waves etc., whenever He needed to taste them 
  with destructions and sorrows. Last time He visited them with a severe flood 
  was in August of 2004. He inundated almost the whole country of Bangladesh 
  with his blessing. The fury of His blessing also destroyed His own House, 
  which is also known as Mosque. But the Muslims of this great country never 
  faltered from their faith in Him; on the contrary, they made it known to Him 
  through all conceivable postures that no matter how harshly He tasted them, 
  they would never give up the supplications He has prescribed for them through 
  His Book of Mercy and Wisdom. The man in this picture represents almost all 
  the Allah-loving and Religion-fearing (dhur’mu viru in Bengali) Muslims of 
  Bangladesh. </p>

  <p>This picture, taken on August 11, 2004 from Trimohani, a village on the 
  fringe of Dhaka by a photographer of New Age, Dhaka, shows a man saying his 
  prayer to Allah in presence of some swans. He had to say his prayer on the 
  boat because Allah, in His rage, had destroyed not only his house but also the 
  mosque while unleashing His blessing on his village. </p>
  <p>Since the Muslims of Bangladesh have never failed to thank Allah for all 
  the blessings He bestowed on them from time to time, He found Himself 
  obligated to show them the path of prosperity when the infidels of the world 
  were going down the hill. In keeping with His concern for the wellbeing of the 
  Muslims of Bangladesh, He helped them raise their per capita income from $ 
  87.00 in 1972-73 to about $ 400.00 in 2004. He also planted all kinds of 
  natural resources under their country’s soil (see Bangladesh’s Finance 
  Minister Saifur Rahman’s statement, as published under the heading of 
  “Bangladesh no less a wonder than Taj” by The New Age of Dhaka in its issue of 
  December 9, 2004). </p>
  <p>The intelligent and austerity-minded people of Bangladesh have been 
  extracting only a small quantity of natural gas along with a friction of crude 
  oil that has been lying under their land from time immemorial. In fact, this 
  gifted land of Allah has been floating, like the State of Kuwait, on oil. And 
  this good news came to them from none other than one of the former American 
  Ambassadors to Dhaka. </p>
  <p>Despite knowing that their country holds all known minerals beneath its 
  soil, its people have not touched the huge quantity, among others, of coal, 
  gypsum, cement clinker, zinc and iron ore, gold and diamond as yet. They have 
  been waiting for the right time to extract these resources so that they may be 
  able to use them to their best advantage. </p>
  <p>We are of the opinion that the people of Bangladesh will start extracting 
  their mineral resources only after other nations of the world have run out of 
  their reserves. This would allow them not only to bargain for best prices for 
  their minerals, it would also put them in a position of command and great 
  respect. Once this position is achieved, there would remain not a single 
  nation on earth that would be able to thwart Bangladesh’s bid at becoming a 
  member of the United Nations’ Security Council with a veto power. </p>
  <p>It was the above future plan of the people of Bangladesh that required 
  Sheikh Hasina to assume the title of “Vishwa Netri” i.e. the Leader of the 
  World. Sensing that the future leadership of the world was going to rest on 
  her strong and capable shoulders, all other leaders of the world looked to her 
  for advice and guidance, when she was heading the government of her country. 
  One of her admirers was Bill Clinton, the former President of the United 
  States. </p>
  <p>When he was having difficulties in negotiating a Peace Agreement between 
  Israel and Palestine, he turned to Sk. Hasina for guidance. It was she who 
  steered Clinton through the complex negotiations of Camp David. Without her, 
  the world would have become a dangerous place a few years ago. </p>
  <p>The number of intellectuals among the people of Bangladesh is highest in 
  the world. They can be found in all strata of the Bengali society. Most of 
  them who belong to the teachers’ community have been rendering sterling 
  services to their nation by having themselves divided among the political 
  parties of their country. They identify themselves by coded colors. One group 
  that belongs to one political party calls itself “Blue.” Another that belongs 
  to another party identifies itself as “Green.” </p>
  <p>Following the philosophies of their respective political parties has been 
  paying them rich dividends. Those of them who align themselves with the ruling 
  party are rewarded by lucrative and prestigious postings and other perks. 
  Those of them who struggle with the party without power get themselves 
  compensated when their party returns to the seat of governance. This has been 
  happening for some time; it is going to continue, Allah-Willing, in future as 
  well. </p>
  <p>There are other intellectuals who do not care much for political windfalls. 
  They are contended with inspiring the nation with the fictitious roles they 
  themselves played in their professional lives. Some of them are: Ms. Kabori-a 
  famous movie actress of yesteryears; Ms. Shomi Kaiser-a small screen drama 
  actress and Mr. Asaduzzaman Noor, a much acclaimed T.V drama actor, who now 
  seats in the ‘Sangsad’ (constituent National Assembly) to make laws for the 
  nation. They are true intellectuals who have been inspiring the nation beyond 
  anything we could ever imagine in our worthless lives. </p>
  <p>The people of Bangladesh are the true practitioners of democracy. The 
  entire world ought to take a few lessons from their practices. </p>
  <p>Imbued with the true spirit of democracy, they believe that everything the 
  nation has belongs to all of them. As owners of all things that exist on their 
  land, they take the responsibility of not only preserving but also of 
  destroying them when destruction suites their fancy. In spontaneous political 
  actions, they can destroy your vehicle, if they find it in front of them at 
  their agitated moments on the street. They can set public transports on fire 
  and kill its occupants, if they think such an action of theirs is going to 
  help them advance their political causes. They can destroy your property, if 
  they believe you belong to a different school of thought and do not sympathize 
  with their viewpoints. They can block the streets so that even the sick 
  people, requiring medical help, cannot go to doctors or hospitals. They are 
  also often found using the public thoroughfares for carrying out their mass 
  communication with the public. </p>
  <p>Since the Bangladeshi public are much benefited by their leaders’ sermons, 
  they do not feel inconvenienced when they find some of their streets blocked 
  by large podiums built on them for their leaders to deliver their sermons 
  from. We believe this part of Bangladeshi democracy is becoming a fad among 
  other world leaders who are reportedly contemplating to adopt this concept for 
  themselves so that they, too, can make use of this unique and democratic idea 
  in their respective countries. </p>
  <p>The people of Bangladesh have taken democracy to a level that other 
  inhabitants of our earth could not have even imagined. Because in democracy 
  you are not supposed to trust your opponents, they have come up with the great 
  and unique concept of a “Care-Taker government.” </p>
  <p>Unlike other decadent and corrupt practices of other so-called democratic 
  countries of the world, the people of Bangladesh do not believe that their 
  government can ever hold fair and free and impartial elections. They have, 
  therefore, come up with a law of their own that requires their government to 
  hand over its power to the immediately-retired judge of their Supreme Court. 
  After taking over the reigns of the government, the retired judge then 
  conducts the country’s general elections. </p>
  <p>In this way, the people of Bangladesh have ensured the continuity of a 
  unique kind of democracy that is likely to be emulated by many other nations 
  of the world. It is going to prove to mankind that even though India is 
  claimed to have introduced the world to the concept of “Zero,” Bangladesh has 
  not lagged behind it; on the contrary, it gave mankind the gift of a pure and 
  incorruptible democracy that is going to make human lives more meaningful and 
  enjoyable not only for the present but also for all times to come. </p>
  <p>Most people of Bangladesh are also very kind and egalitarian minded. They 
  were able to develop these qualities in them due to the teachings of Islam. It 
  teaches its followers to be kind not only to other humans but also to animals. 
  It also requires them to be egalitarian in all walks of their lives. </p>
  <p>Following their religious dictums, the Muslims of Bangladesh deal with each 
  other with great kindness and love. They do not fight among themselves, nor do 
  they kill each other. In fact, they abhor killing and all acts of violence. 
  Despite their beliefs being deep-rooted in their religion, they do not hate or 
  kill the people of other religions. This explains why a huge number of Hindus, 
  Buddhists, Christians and Jews prefer Bangladesh to other Islamic States of 
  the world. </p>
  <p>This peaceful and sober human nature, which the Muslims of Bangladesh 
  possess, has forced the State Department of the United States of America to 
  admit that this country does not harbor any “terrorist outfits” (see News from 
  Bangladesh of December 17, 2004 for full an full account). </p>
  <p>Neither had we seen any terrorist outfit in Afghanistan either, until 
  American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania fell victim to terrorist attacks. 
  Only after the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York did we realize that 
  the leaders of the attackers were embedded in Afghanistan and that we needed 
  to act against them to save ourselves and our future generations from their 
  wrath. What happened later has become part of history. </p>
  <p>Such a situation is not like to develop ever in Bangladesh, as the majority 
  of its Muslims are docile, moderate and highly civilized. At least, this is 
  what we can infer from the clean bill of health the American Administration 
  has given to them. </p>
  <p>Those of the miscreants the RAB of Bangladesh has been killing almost on a 
  daily basis are not Bangladeshis; rather, they are those people who have 
  infiltrated into Bangladesh from its neighboring states to malign the 
  peace-loving people of Bangladesh with their nefarious activities. With their 
  elimination, Bangladesh will one day become free of all foreign terrorists, 
  thereby proving what the American State Department has said as being 
  absolutely true. This great country of the ever-peaceful nation of Bengalis 
  would remain a terrorist-free country until the last day of our world, Insha-Allah.
  </p>
  <p>The Muslims of Bangladesh strongly believe in egalitarianism. That is why 
  only six percent of them own over forty percent of their nation’s wealth. They 
  were able to achieve this great feat only because of their religious beliefs. 
  Had they not been inspired by the principles of Islam, there was every 
  possibility that instead of owning only forty percent of their nation’s 
  wealth, they would have ended up gobbling the remaining sixty percent as well.
  </p>
  <p>The people of Bangladesh never compromised on the question of their 
  independence and sovereignty. They are always prepared to fill up all the 
  rivers and ponds of their country with their blood should anyone ever try to 
  temper with these Allah-given gifts. </p>
  <p>The Country Director of the World Bank did once try to meddle with their 
  internal matters. He was not only castigated by almost all the patriots of the 
  country, the government of Bangladesh also took retaliatory actions against 
  him. He was lucky that the Bank did not terminate his job. </p>
  <p>On the other hand, Bangladesh faced one of its worst political crisis 
  during the early part of 1990. The Opposition was bent upon removing the 
  government of the time from power. All attempts to have the differences 
  reconciled failed. </p>
  <p>To help resolve Bangladesh’s internal disputes, many dignitaries from all 
  over the world poured into Bangladesh and counseled both the government and 
  the opposition on their disputes. They not only welcomed such ‘interferences’ 
  from foreigners, even the ordinary people of the country looked towards them 
  for finding a solution to their nation’s problem. Of course, the foreigners 
  had failed to take them out of their national quagmire. </p>
  <p>Fortunately, the world dignitaries’ involvement in Bangladesh’s internal 
  affairs was never viewed by the Bangladesh people as being an interference on 
  their part; had they had considered their efforts as being an interference, in 
  that event, the foreign visitors would have faced the same scary situation as 
  the one that was faced by the Country Director of the World Bank! </p>
  <p>Considering all the human qualities the people of Bangladesh possess as 
  well as the natural resources they have at their disposal, the world business 
  leaders have begun paying their attention that this country deserved all along 
  in its history. Infidel India’s conglomerate TATA was among the first to 
  recognize Bangladesh’s unexplored potentials. </p>
  <p>This Indian giant offered to invest two billion Dollars in Bangladesh. 
  Taiwan business community followed TATA and offered to invest three billion 
  Dollars during the next three years. One of Australia’s major companies is all 
  set to put in five billion Dollars in Bangladesh’s economy. </p>
  <p>The sophisticated investors of France were not to be left behind; they, 
  too, showed their keen interest recently to invest huge sums of money in the 
  once “empty basket” of the world. Lest the Japanese and English people are 
  deprived of the windfall that is likely to occur in the very near future, 
  their governments teamed up together to “develop financing that will focus on 
  combating corruption and ensuring accountability of decision-makers of 
  Bangladesh” (see New Age of Dhaka; December 14, 2004). </p>
  <p>Foreign governments combating corruption and ensuring accountability of the 
  decision-makers of an independent and sovereign country of Bangladesh? Though 
  this idea may appear as weird and undignified for many people, yet Bangladesh 
  accepted this proposal keeping its future in mind. </p>
  <p>This is a real vision to which the Christians Bible has referred in verse 
  29:18 of its Chapter Proverbs. It says: Where there is no vision, the people 
  perish….” </p>
  <p>Inspired, perhaps, by the above saying of the Bible, the Muslim leaders of 
  Bangladesh have opened up their country to the infidel investors of the world. 
  With the influx of their money, its people are going to turn their country 
  into earth’s most powerful nation. And when this happens, all the people of 
  the world will live in a totally different world where peace and happiness, 
  created by their economic prosperity, will become the guiding factor of our 
  lives. </p>
  <p>We are waiting for that day to come. We hope Allah will fulfill His promise 
  to the Muslims and make our earth a bed of roses so that all of them can enjoy 
  their lives without stretching their hands for alms towards His enemies. Insha-Allah!
