  Late Narayan Gupta with his family</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">Narayan Gupta, a <i>passionate<b> 
  Mukto-mona</b></i> from Bengal, passed away on May 7, 2003, in Canada.&nbsp; He was 
  68 years old at the time of his death.&nbsp; A lot has happened since his passing.&nbsp; 
  For one thing, the forum Mukto-mona, which was closer to his heart, has 
  changed and I am sure if he were alive today, he would have liked this new 
  direction of our forum.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">The way I was introduced to Narayan 
  Gupta in 1997 via the Internet was a bit strange.&nbsp; The Internet was a very new 
  medium then.&nbsp; Therefore, netiquette was a very new thing for all of us who 
  decided to wet our feet in new cyber forums.&nbsp; To my knowledge, the only forum 
  we had in those days was NFB (News From Bangladesh), which used to provide 
  news digest from Dhaka.&nbsp; There was a section call “Readers’ Opinion” that the 
  editor Tanvir Chowdhury kindly provided for an outlet for readers.&nbsp; Narayan 
  Gupta was a permanent fixture in that forum.&nbsp; He used to post his one 
  paragraph of witty remarks on contemporary affairs.&nbsp; Critiquing India’s caste 
  system, Bharatiya Janata Party, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Miah Nawaz Sharif, 
  and Shangha Parivar was his main forte.&nbsp; Narayan Gupta occasionally would make 
  comments on M.A. Jinnah, Hussein Shahid Suhrawardy, Khwaza Nazimuddin, A.H. 
  Khan Bhashani and others like them who were instrumental in the Desh Bibhag of 
  1947— a black chapter in our history he rightfully thought. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Now the problem was not with the 
  liberal readers in NFB.&nbsp; A few hard-core anti-Indian Bangalee readers in NFB 
  decided to corner Narayan Gupta for his expressed views in that cyber 
  newspaper.&nbsp; The trouble was that those illiberal readers used to use pen name 
  to lambaste Narayan Gupta and few of our secular writers.&nbsp; When their non-stop 
  tirades made enough noise in NFB, I decided to defend the writings of Narayan 
  Gupta.&nbsp; Immediately I saw that he became my friend.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Narayan Gupta’s writings had a rough 
  edge; therefore, a few of us decided to propose to him to let any of us edit 
  his write-ups.&nbsp; Besides, he was not very particular about typos and wrong 
  spelling of names and places.&nbsp; That onus fell on me to edit Narayan Gupta’s 
  write-ups.&nbsp; Once we did that his writings took a new height.&nbsp; Our opponent now 
  saw a formidable enemy in Narayan Gupta. They did enough research on him.&nbsp; It 
  was easy to do prepare a dossier on Narayan Gupta because he used to use his 
  real name and the place from where he used to write in those days were 
  copiously mentioned at the end of his articles.&nbsp; Our opponent—the illiberal 
  (parochial) folks figured it out through grapevine that Narayan Gupta was 
  suffering from cancer.&nbsp; They used this piece of information in one of their 
  write-ups to state that Narayan Gupta won’t last long in this world.&nbsp; The 
  tenor of the write-up was very mean; it hurt Narayan Gupta and our feelings.&nbsp; 
  Nonetheless, he replied to the mean article written against him with humor and 
  wit. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Talking about humor Narayan Gupta 
  had a lot of it and he used it rather profusely in his lampoon.&nbsp; He used to 
  write articles in which he would bring goats that would talk to each other in 
  hilarious tone.&nbsp; Those incisive writings used to squash his detractors, which 
  he had aplenty.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Narayan Gupta knew his time for the 
  final departure was nearing.&nbsp; However, he felt that he had to tell his stories 
  to cyber readers.&nbsp; As he was going through some tough regimen of chemotherapy, 
  he wrote almost every night.&nbsp; Sometimes I would get e-mail from him near 
  midnight.&nbsp; Those were very powerful write-ups on communal riots that he has 
  seen as a young high school student.&nbsp; I could tell from the first draft of his 
  article that a rage was going through his mind.&nbsp; He reminisced about his time 
  in Kishoreganj, Shorar Char, Kuliar Char, Bhairav Bazar, etc., during 
  1955-1947 riots.&nbsp; Narayan Gupta’s family was from Itna, which is under 
  Kishoreganj subdivision.&nbsp; He hails from the Zamindar Family of Itna.&nbsp; His 
  grandfather was the last Zamindar before the Zaminadri system was abolished 
  from Bengal in early 1990s.&nbsp; Members of the Gupta clan migrated to either 
  Tripura or West Bengal after 1947.&nbsp; Narayan Gupta had his college education in 
  an engineering school in Bihar.&nbsp; Through his work in the 1960s, he visited 
  many backwaters of India.&nbsp; He finally ended up in England.&nbsp; From there he came 
  to Canada and then finally to Maryland, America.&nbsp; By profession, he was a 
  civil engineer.&nbsp; Nevertheless, at heart he was a freethinker and social 
  reformer.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">I found Narayan Gupta’s writing very 
  incisive.&nbsp; I took the liberty of sending scores of his articles to Dhaka’s 
  Daily Star.&nbsp; The newspaper used to print them soon after they would receive 
  them.&nbsp; Once I told him that Dhaka’s newspaper editor must found his writing 
  interesting or else, why is it that his articles were gracing the pages of 
  daily Star?&nbsp; Narayan Gupta was so humbled by my assertion that he said, 
  “Jaffor, it is your doing.”&nbsp; He was very happy to know that while he could not 
  visit an independent Bangladesh, his writings were being published in his 
  motherland.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">I never knew that Narayan Gupta was 
  a born painter.&nbsp; I collaborated on some project with him where I used his 
  cartoons.&nbsp; The pen name he used to draw those sketches was Meher Ali, a 
  character right from Rabindranath’s short story.&nbsp; Needless to say, Meher Ali 
  was a madman.&nbsp; Narayan Gupta found Meher Ali’s spellbound character rather 
  fascinating.&nbsp; It may sound strange that in late 2002 Narayan Gupta had 
  realized his time for departure from this mortal world was nearing.&nbsp; He sent 
  me a request through e-mail asking me to have his recent paintings.&nbsp; I 
  acquiesced in his request.&nbsp; A week later, a package containing Narayan Gupta’s 
  pencil sketch and color paintings came to my doorsteps.&nbsp; Few months later, I 
  learned about his passing away through an e-mail from Fatemolla. &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Narayan Gupta was never afraid to 
  speak his mind.&nbsp; That is precisely why he had many detractors in NFB forum.&nbsp; 
  Many of them had insular mind who did not quite see the vast expanse of his 
  mind.&nbsp; After his demise, I saw one of the detractors of Narayan Gupta 
  admitting publicly in an e-forum for the first time that our enigmatic friend 
  was misunderstood.&nbsp; Many forum-goers who used to loathe Narayan Gupta for his 
  incisive writing now realize that he was a person who never shied away from 
  telling the truth.&nbsp; Narayan Gupta frequently quoted poems of Shamsur Rahman 
  and he admired openly Taslima Nasrin’s stance on women rights issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Narayan Gupta was a myriad minded 
  intellectual and writer.&nbsp; He wrote a few short stories based solely on 
  experiences from his halcyon days in Kishoreganj or Tripura.&nbsp; Those were gems 
  from him. &nbsp;I don’t know if anyone has saved those short stories.&nbsp; The NFB 
  cyber newspaper had published those in 1999 and I wonder if those were saved 
  by any kind soul.&nbsp; With the archive of NFB long gone because of hard disk 
  crash or ISP’s failure, there is no trace of those gems.&nbsp; I will sorely miss 
  these articles.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I was able to save some masterpieces of Narayan 
  Gupta.&nbsp; Some of them are now in Mukto-mona site.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Avijit Roy, Mukto-mona’s founder 
  moderator, lamented the other day telling me that Narayan Gupta’s first year 
  death anniversary have come and gone in May 2004 but we forgot to celebrate 
  the departed writers life.&nbsp; I personally think we have a lot to learn from his 
  life.&nbsp; He was displaced from his ancestral homeland when he was a teenager.&nbsp; 
  He could have never called anyplace his home, really.&nbsp; In reality, he was an 
  itinerant person.&nbsp; However, he had high hopes on humanity.&nbsp; He probably 
  thought that with the advent of technology such as the Internet, diffusion of 
  knowledge would create a global society bereft of repression, obscurantism, 
  gender-based discrimination.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Narayan Gupta was truly a Mukto-mona 
  (freethinker).&nbsp; His absence in our little world of Mukto-mona is greatly 
  missed by his friends.&nbsp; Narayan Gupta, wherever you are, please note that this 
  little forum of ours is making a stride in the right direction.&nbsp;</font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">
