  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Famous in his epoch but no longer 
  widely celebrated, Uday Shankar was India’s first modern choreographer and 
  dancer. In August 1975, while I was exploring places for dissertation research 
  on patrons and performers in Rajasthan, India, I met Devilal Samar, 
  founder-director of a folk-theatre museum, the Bharatiya Lok Kala Mandal in 
  Udaipur. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Middle-aged, relaxed, and so 
  knowledgeable in his field that he had written several books (in Hindi) about 
  Rajasthani theatre and puppetry, Devilal Samar leaned back in his desk chair 
  as I interviewed him. Wondering how he had come to found his unique 
  institution, I asked him whether anyone in his family had an interest in the 
  arts. He said, “No, they are all businessmen.” </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Then how,” I asked, “did you come to 
  take performing arts as your profession?” </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Well, I studied music from age 16 or 
  17, but when I was at Almora, Dada taught me to be creative.” </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Who is Dada?” I asked innocently. For 
  though I had spent three years of the last thirteen living in India, I didn’t 
  know who he was talking about. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Dada!! Uday Shankar, of course,” he 
  replied. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Devilal Samar then told me about Uday 
  Shankar’s career, beginning with his birth in Udaipur, dancing with Pavlova, 
  years in Europe with his dance company, and Simkie, his French partner. 
  Eventually Samar came to tell me of the Uday Shankar India Culture Centre at 
  Almora, in the foothills of the Himalayas, where he had studied. Referring to 
  Uday Shankar’s company he said, “It was the first troupe.” Through this 
  company “Uday Shankar has given a new horizon to Indian dance. His technique 
  is a form in itself.” I found out that Uday Shankar was living in Calcutta, 
  and Samar described him as old and paralyzed (a false rumor, as it turned 
  out). During my dissertation research in Jaipur in 1977, I learned that he had 
  died in Calcutta. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I returned to Chicago, I searched 
  for a biography or memoir of Shankar, so I could find out more about his 
  career in dance. But there was none. Eventually I reached original materials 
  in the Indian arts journal, Roopa-Lekha, and other publications about Uday 
  Shankar during the peak of his career in the 1930s. And I was amazed at what I 
  read. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">UDAY SHANKAR was a big name, a star! 
  He had received rave reviews in Paris and New York, London and Calcutta. His 
  photos showed a stage presence and an aesthetic which was still appealing, and 
  his dance repertoire was extensive and progressive. Why, I asked myself, did 
  no one talk of Shankar in India today? Wasn’t he the forerunner of India’s 
  great dance renaissance in the 1930s? Why did one of Delhi’s major presenters 
  claim that her ballets owed nothing to Shankar, when it was clear to me that 
  they did? Why did people say that Shankar didn’t know dance, that he had never 
  been trained in dance? How could he have been so successful and so untrained 
  at the same time? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I completed my Ph.D. in 1980, I 
  decided to take up the questions which had been provoking me about Uday 
  Shankar. My research has since then spanned twenty years. During this time I 
  have considered some major aspects of Shankar’s life and career in work I 
  presented and published, such as his ‘translation’ of dance for western 
  audiences, the women in his life—his major patrons, his authenticity, and his 
  impact on audiences in India and the west. Each issue contributes to the 
  making of Shankar’s biography. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But a biography needs more than 
  issues, it needs the continuity of a narrative, which may not follow a strict 
  chronology if the material suggests otherwise. My recently completed memoir of 
  Zohra Segal, now an acclaimed actress but formerly a leading dancer in Uday 
  Shankar’s company, had led me to think about how life journeys have critical 
  turning points, such as leaving one’s homeland, or rebelling against 
  expectations. For Shankar one turning point that changed his life was setting 
  out from India as a 20-year-old art student in 1920. Unlike the Segal book, 
  however, which is a co-written memoir, the book on Shankar is my own account: 
  a critical view of what he wrought and the contexts in which he succeeded and 
  failed, and his impact on contemporary as well as continuing dance in India. 
  So two major considerations in writing of Uday Shankar are the impact of this 
  Indian choreographer and dancer on his times, and the significance of his life 
  and works for our times. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I started researching Shankar’s 
  life and art in the early 1980s, he had recently died and was known mainly to 
  those in India who had seen or heard of his splendid dance, as well as those 
  notable artists out of India who encountered him in his prime years, 
  1931-1938. Many people, however, were unaware of his importance. They didn’t 
  know that he was the initiator of India’s modern dance traditions, a key 
  impetus for the reclaiming or renaissance of Indian classical dance forms, a 
  founder of cultural centers for the study of dance and other arts, and the 
  first Indian to perform in significant venues for Indian dance in Europe and 
  North America. Nor did many people understand that western perceptions of 
  Indian stage dance were shaped by the world tours of the Uday Shankar Company 
  of Hindu Dancers and Musicians in the 1930s. And practically no one except 
  Indian experts and a few western devotees knew that Uday Shankar was not only 
  the elder brother of famed sitarist Pandit Ravi Shankar, but that it was 
  because of him that Ravi Shankar had become a musician and artist of the 
  world. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course the audience for a biography 
  of Shankar extends beyond those knowledgeable few (whose numbers diminish with 
  the passing years) to those who will know of his beauty, his genius, and his 
  contributions only through books, occasional re-creations of his works, and 
  his single film, Kalpana (Imagination). So in writing Uday’s biography I keep 
  in mind an audience of readers from several generations, as well as from 
  multiple cultures. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In addition, there is the importance 
  of situating Shankar historically. His major contributions came during the 
  period preceding Indian independence, during the last years of colonial rule, 
  when Gandhi was meeting the British in his dhoti in London, and Indians were 
  actively nationalistic, provoked and affirmed by the Congress Party. Uday 
  Shankar’s father was his mentor and advisor; he inhabited a world of Sanskrit 
  scholarship and Indian princely states, living comfortably both in India and 
  in England. Uday Shankar, a Bengali Brahmin, was raised in a village near 
  Benaras and in the princely state of Jhalawar, where his father held a series 
  of official posts in this small Rajasthani kingdom. His education continued in 
  Bombay and in London, where he went to join his father in 1920. So when he 
  sailed back to India at age 30, after ten consecutive years in Europe and 
  America, he had to rediscover his land. After a year he left India again, 
  taking his family to Paris, the base for his first dance company of Indian 
  artists, co-founded with Swiss sculptress Alice Boner. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So Uday Shankar was an expatriate, a 
  Europeanized Indian, a self-made artiste, a non-observant Hindu Brahmin, and a 
  handsome presence who loved women. His personal and professional life are an 
  intertwined whole, so trying to separate private events from public ones is 
  contra-indicated, although the whole is not without controversy. Still it is 
  to India’s dance art that he made his most impressive contributions. He 
  practically reinvented Indian dance single-handedly. He placed it on stage in 
  technically up-to-date settings, realizing an aesthetic which affirmed the 
  spirituality expected by western audiences and the Indianness claimed by 
  Indian ones, as discussed in my 1987 article, “Performance as Translation: 
  Uday Shankar in the West.” So why is it, in the 1980s and 1990s that few in 
  India want to acknowledge his influence on their works? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The renaissance in Indian dance, which 
  began in the late 1920s, and flowered in the 1930s, is irretrievably part of 
  Uday Shankar’s story. In my article, “Dance Discourses: Rethinking the History 
  of the ‘Oriental Dance’” I have addressed this interrelationship. Shankar 
  found Balasaraswati in Madras during his 1933 tour, and invited her to join 
  his company for a visit in Calcutta in 1934. He presented his repertoire to 
  Indian audiences during this tour, and enthralled spectators who had seen no 
  other stage dance in India except foreign visitors such as Denishawn, who 
  toured in 1926. He took as his guru the Kathakali dance-drama master, 
  Shankaran Namboodiri, and worked with him on successive visits to India. And 
  he promoted classical dance in his Almora Culture Centre, with four gurus 
  presiding over Kathakali, Bharatanatyam, Manipuri, and Hindustani Sangeet 
  (North Indian classical music). But by 1935 during his second tour in India, a 
  few Indians had seen the devadasi dance renamed as Bharatanatyam. They 
  questioned whether Shankar’s dance was Indian, was authentic, was classical, 
  and should be called ‘ballet’. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Three years after Indian independence 
  in 1947, when the national academy of performing arts, Sangeet Natak Akademi, 
  reconceptualized India’s arts, the few classical dance styles and the myriad 
  Indian folk dances became their focus. Uday Shankar’s creative dance was not 
  in the picture, though he had made India his permanent base since 1938. For 
  the new nation, unity in diversity (a kind of echo of the American e pluribus 
  unum), infused cultural policy as well as politics. Dance was to be either 
  classical or folk, and there was no room for new traditions, such as that of 
  Shankarstyle dance. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Where was Uday Shankar and his dance 
  in this 1950s scheme? His Almora Culture Centre was disbanded in 1942, with 
  several of his artists moving on to form their own companies. Shankar went to 
  Madras to make his only film, Kalpana, which he showed in India and abroad in 
  1948-49. Praised for its dance filming, critics and audiences found Kalpana’s 
  story troubling. It was a pre-independence narrative, and contained reminders 
  of what was alleged to tarnish Uday’s reputation. In brilliantly creative 
  dance scenes and less scintillating dramatic ones, Kalpana satirized Indians 
  who tried to retain lost power after independence and showed women in 
  competition for his favors. When Uday Shankar looked for backing for his next 
  dance company, he found it only in Bengal, his family homeland, where he and 
  his wife Amala eventually settled in 1956. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pre-independence nationalism was 
  transmuted, in the new nation, into affirmation of its ancient heritage. 
  Despite this preference, Shankar’s new company, continuing his inventive 
  choreographies and modernist presentations, toured in China, the United 
  States, and Europe, straining financially in the post-war epoch. The last 
  decades of Shankar’s life were a complex journey of success and struggle, his 
  fame eclipsed by national promotion of classical dance as evidence of an 
  ancient heritage and thus a place for India among the civilized nations of the 
  world. The Uday Shankar Company persists today, based in Calcutta and led by 
  his partner and widow, Amala Shankar. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But strikingly, in the 1980s and 
  l990s, there has been a sea change, and it neither obliterates nor replaces 
  the suspicion and smug dismissal of Uday Shankar which characterized his 
  latter years and the difficult decades which followed. What has changed? How 
  can this social history be integrated into the bio-history of Uday Shankar? 
  This context is as much a part of his genius as is his choreography, his 
  costumes and lights, his timing and rhythmic sense, his stage presence, and 
  his reputation. There are, it turns out, not one, not two, not even three, but 
  four or five twists in the Uday Shankar pathway, and they are integral to any 
  analysis of his works, as well as to his continuing presence in the world of 
  Indian dance and modern ideas of choreography in India. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For instance, a Bombay critic, writing 
  of Shankar’s new ballets, Rhythm of Life and Labour and Machinery, recognized 
  that the choreographer had enlarged his thematic reach to include Gandhi’s 
  social philosophy of unity and castelessness. The pieces thus proffered a new 
  nationalistic energy for progress, following a decade of religio-mythological 
  ballets and light folk-based divertissements. After independence Shankar took 
  the Buddha as a theme, and later he experimented in his Shankarscope 
  production with mixed media of film and dance. Well aware that dance was for 
  its own times and for particular audiences, Shankar wanted to try new ideas, 
  explore new media, and consider contemporary themes. This evolutionary 
  perspective is continued today as Indian dancers and choreographers turn to 
  new dance, and as some recognize Shankar’s contribution to their modern art.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">‘New directions in Indian dance’ has 
  become the guiding text for the current turn, which dates from the 1980s. It 
  includes the creation of techniques, grammars and styles for a truly Indian 
  modern dance (sometimes referred to as “new dance”). It is manifest in 
  reconfiguration of ballets based on Bharatanatyam, in explorations merging 
  Indian forms such as yoga and chhau and the martial art of kalaripayyatt, and 
  in experimental fusions of western and Indian dance, mainly outside of India 
  in the United States and Canada, England, Germany, France as well as Japan and 
  Australia. So choreographers, dancers, critics and presenters of new dance are 
  also potential readers of Uday Shankar’s biography, and need to have a sense 
  of how Shankar created and choreographed his ‘new dance for the 30s’, which 
  was seen then as ‘authentic Indian dance’ by Europeans, and many Indians, at 
  least at first. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus the history of European and 
  Indian knowledge of India’s dance forms becomes a site of controversy in the 
  biography of Uday Shankar. That is, European experience of ‘oriental dance’, 
  from the often-seen ballets of the Romantic era, present the oriental dancer 
  as a bayadere, related to the odalisque of eastern harems: a veiled, 
  mysterious, sexually unexplored figure, rather more like the sylphs than the 
  tawaifs and devadasis they were. ‘Orientalism’ wasn’t based on subtle or sharp 
  distinctions between the cultures of the East; rather these cultures were 
  grouped together as ‘other’, and seen as dark, mysterious, spiritual, exotic, 
  erotic and altogether enticing. Male dancers from the East were few and far 
  between. As recent writings have suggested, such masculine presences did not 
  fulfill the orientalist strategy of using females as symbols for submission to 
  patriarchy and colonialism, a theme which preoccupied, consciously and 
  subconsciously, much of European arts in the l9th and early 20th centuries.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 1930s the advent of a Male 
  Oriental Dancer was quite a revelation. Suddenly there was an exotic oriental 
  dark (but not too dark) dancer, who appealed to women. In the 1930s, while 
  touring Uday Shankar and his company in the United States, Russian impresario 
  Sol Hurok noted that Shankar’s audiences were filled with women, who adored 
  him. And, in turn, Uday adored women, who offered themselves to him frequently 
  and openly. Shankar’s major patrons were women, not surprisingly. His company, 
  until 1935, had no other male dancers with his impact, until he brought in 
  Madhavan, trained in the south Indian dance-drama form of Kathakali, to create 
  and present his own solos as a tribal or warrior. But Shankar remained the 
  sole male form of the divine, the god, on stage, in his productions. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the realm of European and American 
  images of the exotic oriental, Shankar’s appearance on the Paris dance scene 
  in the 1930s, and his huge success in France and Germany, as well as America, 
  paralleled a fascination with Eastern spirituality and philosophy. The 
  Theosophical Society was gaining followers in India and abroad. During the 
  time that Uday Shankar’s father, Shyam Shankar Chaudhury, was a Sanskrit 
  scholar in Benares at the turn of the century, he became a follower of 
  Theosophical Society leader Annie Besant. Uday’s main partner in his first 
  company was Simkie, whose mother was a member of the Paris branch of the 
  Theosophical Society. In addition, a number of European women, of various 
  descent and experience though none of them Indian, had promoted themselves to 
  the Paris public as Indian dancers. Probably the most famous–and later 
  notorious–was Mata Hari, who presented herself as a devotee of Shiva at the 
  Musee Guimet in 1905. So when Uday Shankar appeared as an authentic Indian, 
  but an accessible one, able to enter the demi-monde and other Paris society as 
  a Brahmin, son of an Indian princely state’s Foreign Minister, and a former 
  partner of prima ballerina Anna Pavlova, this was an entirely different 
  presence, with legitimizing credentials in place. The fact that he found high 
  class patronage, sponsorship, and venues for his programs were a function of 
  both his genius and talent, as well as his connections. One of the issues 
  which I have been researching is the fact that Uday Shankar, in 1924, couldn’t 
  succeed in London, despite these connections, but did find support and avenues 
  for this dance in Paris. Why? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This leads to arguments about the 
  nature of success and fame in the life of a dancer and choreographer. Is 
  talent enough? I doubt it. Are social and political connections sufficient? It 
  seems not to be the case, though they provide some avenues for the competent. 
  But both talent and connections, situated in a place and time when what is 
  offered is appreciated, even catches fire, that is a magical formula. And to 
  understand how the contexts, historical and geographical, provide such a 
  welcoming venue, one must explore and understand them as well. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a biographer I must also consider 
  the history of India’s cultural presence in Europe in the early part of the 
  twentieth century. Who were the other dancers and dances which were seen by 
  the same audiences as saw Shankar? What were the aesthetic bases for dance 
  criticism in the period, and what was the infrastructure for dance in Europe? 
  How can I compare that system with the venues and sponsors of dance in India 
  during Shankar’s dance career? Nationalism and colonialism are not mere 
  external contexts for Shankar’s dance and success; they are the context in the 
  midst of which he performed, was reviewed, met his patrons, and created his 
  repertoire. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, there is the repertoire 
  itself—a sine qua non— and audience and critical response to Shankar’s 
  productions. In evaluating and analyzing Shankar’s opus, the same complexities 
  of time are involved. What was modern in the 1930s is historical today. Was 
  his legacy to be in touch with his times? In that case his son Ananda and wife 
  Tanushree Shankar are carrying on his father’s new tradition in their Calcutta 
  company. Or was his choreography so far ahead of its time as to be only 
  understood now? Recently, viewing Uday Shankar’s Kalpana in Madras (now called 
  Chennai), I sat amongst a dance audience from the Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, 
  which presents an annual dance conference every December. An Italian 
  practitioner of Bharatanatyam and scholar of Indian culture exclaimed while 
  watching Shankar’s dances, “This is new, it’s post-modern, it’s Indian! 
  Everyone needs to see this now.” I am writing of Uday Shankar in the 
  expectation that these questions are for our times as well as his own. </font>
