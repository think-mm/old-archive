  <font face="Verdana">I learned about the most celebrated Bangalee dancer, Uday 
  Shankar, and his troupe when I was growing up in the fifties from my two elder 
  sisters and my father.&nbsp; They used to speak of the choreographer, Uday Shankar, 
  almost in reverence.&nbsp; Many years had past by since I heard the encomiums on 
  Uday and his youngest brother Ravi Shankar for their dancing and sitar 
  virtuoso, respectively.&nbsp; It is even surprising that Ravindra Shankar, the 
  original name of Ravi Shankar, was both a dancer and an Esraj player in Uday’s 
  troupe in the 1930s.&nbsp; More on that later.&nbsp; Let me however relate to you an 
  incidence that had invoked my interest in Uday Shankar. </font><br>

  <font face="Verdana">In the summer of 1975, I was at Stony Brook, Long Island, 
  New York where I was doing my first postdoctoral work at the Biochemistry 
  Department of SUNY.&nbsp; Some Bangalees working at the nearby Brookhaven National 
  Lab had arranged a performance of “Tasher Desh” by Rabitirtha, a cultural 
  organization from Kolkata under the able leadership of Ms. Suchitra Mitra — a 
  leading exponent of Rabindra Sangeet in those days.&nbsp; There was nothing 
  exciting going on in Long Island in the dead of the summer in eastern Long 
  Island, which was considered than a wasteland as far as culture goes.&nbsp; 
  Therefore, the news of the performance of Tagore’s “Tasher Desh” was music to 
  my ear.&nbsp; It was on a weekend, late in the afternoon, the performance was being 
  held at the auditorium of the Brookhaven National Lab.&nbsp; A small crowd of about 
  250-300 people, mostly American, had milled to watch the dance drama “Tasher 
  Desh” (A World of Playing Cards).&nbsp; Rabitirtha was a cultural organization 
  based in Kolkata that had received glowing encomiums everywhere for their 
  interpretation of many dance dramas of Rabindranath Tagore.&nbsp; Therefore, I felt 
  I was lucky to see a live performance of “Tasher Desh” (The land of cards) 
  done by such a celebrated dance troupe.&nbsp; Of course, at the helm was none other 
  than Ms. Suchitra Mitra, who was in her late forties or early fifties in those 
  days.&nbsp; Her tastes and temperament were very modern. Her hair was styled 
  according to western style; nonetheless, she wore a beautiful sari.&nbsp; She gave 
  the introduction of Tagore’s dance drama in perfect Indianized British accent, 
  which was understandable by most attendees.&nbsp; The music accompanying the drama 
  was done live.&nbsp; That added a zest to the play.&nbsp; The performance was so good 
  that we all gave a standing ovation.&nbsp; </font><br>

  <br>
  <font face="Verdana">During the intermission, we all gathered outside the 
  auditorium on the hallway and chitchatted with the musicians.&nbsp; I remember 
  talking to Ms. Suchitra Mitra as I congratulated for bringing her troupe to 
  outside world.&nbsp; On learning that I am from Dhaka, she told me that her troupe 
  had performed Tagore’s dance drama “Chitranggada” in 1972 perhaps on December 
  1972.&nbsp; Both Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh, and Indira 
  Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India at the time, were present at the recital.&nbsp; 
  I was lucky enough to obtain a photo from the Internet that shows Suchitra 
  Mitra and her troupe along with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Indira Gandhi at the 
  end of the performance.&nbsp; [Attach Photo Here].&nbsp; It was only 3 years after the 
  performance of Rabitirtha’s Chitranggada in Dhaka that Ms. Mitra was 
  reminiscing the event.&nbsp; It was nice to hear about the history-making 
  performance, which I heard about but could not have attended.&nbsp; Ms. Mitra was 
  in hot demand; many Americans wanted to say hello to her, therefore, I had to 
  let go her.&nbsp; A percussionist of Rabitirtha then made his acquaintance with 
  me.&nbsp; He became excited knowing that I was from Sylhet. The tabalchi 
  (percussionist) himself was from Sylhet, a man in his mid forties, struck a 
  conversation with me.&nbsp; Among other things, he told me that he plays tabla 
  taranga and other percussion instruments for the celebrated music director 
  R.D. Burman.&nbsp; Then he told me that he joined the dance troupe of Uday Shankar 
  in the late 1940s being a teenage.&nbsp; There he met a very bright Bangalee boy 
  from Chittagong.&nbsp; He said that the boy who was also his age was a very 
  talented dancer who joined Uday Shankar’s school without the consent of his 
  parents.&nbsp; The Chittagonian boy returned to his home sometime in 1948-1949.&nbsp; I 
  knew immediately whom he was talking about.&nbsp; I said, “Is this Bulbul Chowdhury?”&nbsp; 
  “Yes, this was him,” was the reply.&nbsp; We then briefly chitchatted centering on 
  the short life of Bulbul Chowdhury.&nbsp; Bulbul joined Uday’s school of modern 
  dance because that was the best thing one could have done if he or she liked 
  modern dance at the time.&nbsp; Upon his return to East Pakistan he started a 
  school of dancing somewhere in Old Dhaka.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he died very 
  prematurely.&nbsp; Many of his students continued to learn dancing from other 
  teachers but they named the school “Bulbul Academy of Fine Arts” or “BAFA.”&nbsp; 
  In Bangla, we knew the school as “Bulbul Lalit Kola Academy.”&nbsp; I was thrilled 
  to make an acquaintance to a person who knew Bulbul Chowdhury so well.&nbsp; Bulbul 
  was from Chittagong district, a very conservative place.&nbsp; It is something else 
  to come out of a conservative place or family and then to join the most 
  avant-garde dance school in India.&nbsp; My hat is off to Bulbul Chowdhury for 
  being such a pioneer in starting a dance movement in a conservative society in 
  the backwaters of East Bengal.&nbsp; It is very sad that he had to die so early in 
  the prime of his life.&nbsp; The cultural scene of Dhaka could have been a vibrant 
  one in the dismal days of 1960s had he been alive.&nbsp; <br>

  <font face="Verdana">Digging the Internet I learned that Ms. Suchitra Mitra 
  was herself a dancer in the early 1950s.&nbsp; She knew Mrs. Amala Shankar, Uday’s 
  charming wife, because both of then had danced together in Rabindra dance 
  recital.&nbsp; The nineteen fifties were very lush time; there was a rejuvenation 
  of cultural reawakening in the newly independent nation.&nbsp; And the center of 
  such movement was Kolkata. Rabindranath had already made Kolkata the center 
  for Manipuri Dance.&nbsp; It is therefore appropriate that others have joined the 
  cultural renaissance ushered in by the great poet himself.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  Uday Shankar closed his school that he started in late thirties in Almora, 
  Uttar Pradesh as the World War II raged in Europe.&nbsp; When the war ended, he 
  then shifted his school to Kolkata where he started to live permanently.&nbsp; By 
  this time, Amala and Uday Shankar had their son, Ananda, who later became a 
  rock-fusion musician touring in the seventies and eighties Europe.&nbsp; Their 
  daughter, Mamta, was born later who followed in the footsteps of her parents.&nbsp; 
  I read news in 2003 about her dance recital in Dhaka.&nbsp; There was even a photo 
  of her aged mother, Amala, published in Dhaka’s newspapers. </font><br>

  <p><font face="Verdana">I have downloaded quite a few photos of Uday Shankar, 
  which were kindly provided by Mrs. Amala Shankar to many web makers.&nbsp; These 
  photos are widely available in the Internet.&nbsp; Mr. Avijit Roy, one of the 
  moderators of Mukto-mona approached me about having some web pages reserved 
  for giant artists from South Asia.&nbsp; I then requested him to have photos of 
  Uday Shankar who is almost forgotten these days by Indians.&nbsp; Uday is a product 
  of a Bengali family from Jessore—a southwestern district of Bangladesh.&nbsp; He is 
  a son of the soil, so to speak.&nbsp; Uday had single-handedly influenced the 
  modern dance of India who incorporated the delicate movements of western 
  ballet into our traditional dance.&nbsp; He also patronized the classical music of 
  South Asia.&nbsp; His school was like a waterhole for some very creative minds of 
  my father’s generation. </font><br>

  <p><font face="Verdana"><br>
  The dancer par excellence had attracted many talents from India and Europe.&nbsp; 
  For some strange reason only women were attracted to him.&nbsp; Some of his critics 
  have mentioned that Uday wanted to be the sole attraction in his dance and for 
  this reason he was surrounded by a gaggle of beauties in his dance routine.&nbsp; 
  Because of Uday’s closeness to Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, many other 
  European women were attracted his dance troupe.&nbsp; A stunning French woman by 
  the name Simkie was Uday’s consort in many dances.&nbsp; Uday was also instrumental 
  in introducing another stunner, Kanaklata, his cousin to join his troupe 
  “Hindu Dancers.”&nbsp; Amala was another very pretty dancer in his troupe who 
  became his wife in the late 1930s.&nbsp; A stunning young lady from Madras, Laxmi, 
  also joined his school in Almora.&nbsp; Laxmi later married Uday’s younger brother, 
  Rajendra Shankar, and became a full-time vocalist.&nbsp; She settled down in 
  California where she used to manage a Hindustani school of vocal music.&nbsp; In 
  early 1980s, she came to Urbana, Illinois, when she gave a recital at the 
  auditorium of Music department at the University of Illinois.&nbsp; In a reception 
  after the recital, I talked to her briefly.&nbsp; She surprised me by talking to me 
  in fluent Bangla.&nbsp; When I asked her where she learned Bangla, she laughed and 
  said in Bangla “ora to bashai shobai Bangla bole” (they all speak Bangla at 
  home). </font></p>

  India in 1956, both Uday and Amala met the visiting leader (please see the 
  photo).&nbsp; In the sixties and seventies Uday’s name and fame had waned.&nbsp; His 
  health started deteriorating and he passed away in 1977 in Kolkata.&nbsp; 
  Single-handedly, this talented artist brought modernity to Indian dance.&nbsp; His 
  disciples have become stalwarts in Indian dance scene.&nbsp; His daughter, Mamata, 
  is now carrying Uday’s mettle.&nbsp; In this day and age of television and 
  Bollywood entertainment, we do not read many articles that bestow a glowing 
  encomium to Uday Shankar.&nbsp; Here in this forum we thought we should celebrate 
  Uday’s life and his art.&nbsp; Therefore, we decided to devote a few web pages with 
  some precious photos of Uday and his loved ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
