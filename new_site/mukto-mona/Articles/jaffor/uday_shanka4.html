  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not too long ago an 
  American colleague and a friend of 20-years let me borrow a 12-inch vinyl 
  phonograph album (to be run at 33.33 rpm in a turntable), which he said that I 
  would enjoy enormously.&nbsp; My friend knew well how much I love listening to raga 
  or classical music of South Asia.&nbsp; I grew up listening to thumri, kheyal, and 
  other forms of light classical music in the 1950s and 1960s growing up in 
  Tejgaon, Dhaka.&nbsp; My father used to arrange once in a while all night music <i>
  Jalsa</i> in our house where mot only vocalists but sitar, sarod, esraj, etc., 
  player would play only ragas to our hearts' content.</font><O:P></O:P></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After hearing my friend's word on this vinyl 
  record album, I thought that he was going to lend me a sitar or sarod recital 
  of either Pundit Ravi Shankar or Ustad Ali Akbar Khan but when he handed me 
  the album, I could not believe my eyes.&nbsp; He lent me an album that was recorded 
  in 1937 when Uday Shankar's dance troupe visited America for the first time.&nbsp; 
  In those days, the dance troupe used to have a dozen or so musicians traveling 
  with them who would supply the lush live music for dances.&nbsp; Apparently, 
  someone record company in New York City had taped the music using a modern 
  recorder.&nbsp; Be mindful that in late 1930s ferric tape-based electronic 
  recording has just begun as opposed to mechanical recorder that were common in 
  1920s going into 1930s.&nbsp; Therefore, the fidelity in recording had improved a 
  great deal.&nbsp; The recorded songs of the album were released a year later in 
  1938 but I do not know who had published those songs and in what format.&nbsp; 
  However, lucky for us that RCA decided to re-release these musical gems after 
  31 long years in 1968.&nbsp; The album cover says: &quot;Ragas and Dances.&nbsp; The original 
  Uday Shankar Company of Hindu musicians, recorded during its historic 1937 
  visit to the United States&quot; (RCA Victrola VIC-1361; 1968).</font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><O:P></O:P><font face="Verdana"><br>
  </font></span><font face="Verdana">
  <br>
  There was a liner's note written on the back cover of the album by Mr. James 
  Lyons who described Uday Shankar's dances that were deeply rooted in Hindu 
  mythology.&nbsp; The front cover had a black and white photo of high quality, which 
  portrayed Uday Shankar as Shiva and most likely Amala Shankar, his wife as 
  Parvati.&nbsp; In the background was a gaggle of female dancers all posing nicely.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Reading some personal accounts written by others I gathered that Uday Shankar 
  brought his dance troupe to America in 1936.&nbsp; They performed in big cities 
  allover America.&nbsp; Someone had mentioned that Uday's troupe had performed in 
  Boston in 1936.&nbsp; The British upper crust may have heard the temple music 
  earlier but not the middle class in Europe or North America.&nbsp; Uday Shankar 
  is the person who single-handedly had exposed our rich tradition of music and 
  dance to the westerners. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One example of Uday's ambassadorship to the west will be sufficed.&nbsp; I read a 
  description in a web site where someone wrote how Russian dramatist Anton 
  Chekhov was exposed for the very first time to Indian music and dance in 
  England.&nbsp; Here is the excerpt: &quot;Dartington Hall in Southern England is a 
  fourteenth-century castle converted into a centre for rural enterprise, for 
  education and for the arts. By the time of Chekhov's arrival in Dartington it 
  had became a professional centre for the arts, at first in dance — the Kurt 
  Jooss ballet was invited — but ultimately in drama, music and fine arts, and 
  it gained an international reputation.&nbsp; The Indian dancer Uday Shankar 
  performed with his troupe in the open-air theatre (in 1935). Chekhov greatly 
  admired their art for its combination of pure movement and music.&quot;</font><O:P></O:P><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>
  Uday Shankar started performing dances of Indian origin starting from 1920s 
  while he was in England studying paintings.&nbsp; There, he met Russian ballerina, 
  Anna Pavlova, who was world-renowned at the time.&nbsp; Perhaps from her he learned 
  ballet movement and then he incorporated those movements into traditional 
  Indian dances that were based on Ramayana and Puranas.&nbsp; The Hindu god Shiva is 
  known for his <i>praloy nritaya</i> (cosmic dance); therefore, it was easy for 
  Uday Shankar to choreograph dance drama based on Shiva's life.&nbsp; Earlier, a 
  French dancer, Ms. Simkie, joined him who used to play the role of Parvati, 
  Shiva's consort.&nbsp; Later, as his troupe members grew, he cast Indian girls such 
  as his cousin Kanaklata - a stunningly beautiful Bengali beauty or Amala 
  Shankar, his student who became his wife for the role of Parvati.&nbsp; Uday 
  employed his three brothers, Rajendra, Davendra, and Rabindra (who is better 
  known as Ravi Shankar) in his troupe as they toured European cities.&nbsp;</font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><O:P></O:P><font face="Verdana"><br>
  </font></span><font face="Verdana">
  <br>
  For musical accompaniment with the dances, Uday had to assemble a bunch of 
  gifted musicians.&nbsp; He hired a musician by the name Vishnudass Shirali who was 
  a former student of Pundit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, a legendary classical 
  musician, and teacher of Gwaliar Gharana in early twentieth century.&nbsp; 
  Mr. Shirali was the arranger and music director for Uday's troupe.&nbsp; Under his 
  baton was Ustad Alauddin Khan of Comilla who was conversant in playing 
  multiple instruments.&nbsp; Uday's youngest brother, Rabindra Shankar who changed 
  his name later to Ravi Shankar, also played Esraj along with other musicians 
  under Mr. Shirali.&nbsp; Therefore, one could imagine that Uday not only hired 
  stunning beauties as the dancers but also had employed some very gifted 
  musicians, mostly Bangalees, for his dance troupe.<br>
  <br>
  The first thing I did with the vinyl album after receiving from my American 
  friend was to play the album and then digitize the music using my personal 
  computer after which I used a software to remove the noise associated with any 
  vinyl album's surface noise (clicks and pops) and the low-pitched rumble of 
  the turntable.&nbsp; Only after this, did the music come to life and could I hear 
  all the instruments with some clarity and definition.&nbsp; After this, I burned a 
  CD so that I will have a clean copy of the album.&nbsp; Not to mention that CD is a 
  more stable medium then the vinyl album, which is subjected to warp and 
  damage.&nbsp; Luckily, I still have a quality turntable equipped with a new 
  magnetic cartridge.&nbsp; That helped the project of mine.</font><O:P></O:P><font face="Verdana"> <br>

    &nbsp;</font></div>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first side of the album has five songs; these are listed here with time in 
  minutes in parenthesis.&nbsp; 1. Raga <i>Tilanga </i>(4:07); 2. Raga <i>Bahar </i>
  (4:12); 3. Dance Gandharva, Raga <i>Malkauns </i>(4:14); 4. Dance Ramachandra, 
  Raga <i>Simendra Maddhyama</i> - <i>Hamswadhwani </i>(3:58); 5. Tabla <i>
  Taranga</i>, Raga <i>Adana</i> (4:19).&nbsp; Side of the album has the following 
  songs: 6. Dance Kartikeyya, Raga <i>Malkauns</i> (3:48); 7. Dance Indra, Raga
  <i>Bhairava</i> (3:16); 8. Dance <i>Snanum</i>, Raga <i>Durga</i> and <i>
  Khamaj </i>(3:12); 9. Bhajana (3:40);&nbsp; 10.&nbsp; Raga <i>Misra Kafi</i> (3:24).<br>
  <br>
  The first number is an instrumental piece in Raga <i>Tilang</i> or <i>Tilanga</i>, 
  which is a minor Raga, played in late night.&nbsp; The music sounded like it is 
  being played in a Mandir.&nbsp; The instruments include violin, flute, sitar, and 
  of course tabla.&nbsp; The second piece was also an instrumental music.&nbsp; It is a 
  happy music in Raga <i>Bahar </i>or <i>Basant </i>(Spring) in fast tempo.&nbsp; The 
  music starts with a <i>jhala</i> by sitar.&nbsp; The gayeties of spring could be 
  heard in this beautiful piece.&nbsp; The tune reminded me a Bangla song probably a 
  Tagore song whose lyric is as follows: <i>Aji Basanta Jagroto Darey</i> (The 
  spring is alive at my door).&nbsp; I am requesting Mukto-mona forum moderator to 
  include the MP3 version of this song to be included with my piece so that 
  readers can listen and appreciate this very tune by mere a click of the mouse.</font><O:P></O:P><font face="Verdana"> <br>
  <br>
  The third piece is music to accompany a dance number by the name Gandharva; it 
  is in Raga <i>Malkauns</i> or <i>Malkosh</i> (in Bangla) that is a late night 
  Raga imbuing a heroic sentiment.&nbsp; <i>Malkauns</i> is a serious Raga played in 
  a slow tempo at least in the beginning.&nbsp; The fourth cut is a vocal chorus sung 
  in Raga <i>Simhendra</i> <i>Madhyam </i>and <i>Hamswadhwani</i>, a beautiful 
  melodious Raga, to accompany &quot;Dance Ramachandra.&quot;&nbsp; The lyric is probably in 
  Hindustani language (Hindi), the repetitive line is - &quot;<i>Ei Charano Mooley</i>&quot; 
  (At the base of the feet).&nbsp; This beautiful song will be also available for 
  listening in Mukto-mona site.&nbsp; The fifth cut is a gorgeous instrumental piece 
  all played by tunable drum, which is called &quot;Tabla <i>Taranga</i>&quot; (The Tabla 
  Waves) and played in Raga <i>Adana</i>, a midnight Raga.&nbsp; The playing has an 
  oriental feel to it.&nbsp; It almost sounds like Gamelan music of island Bali.&nbsp; 
  This rare piece is still being played occasionally in radio that specializes 
  in playing classical and folk music.&nbsp; It is a must hear music, which will be 
  available to our readers.&nbsp; This concludes side one of the vinyl album.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  The side two starts with song number 6, which is an instrumental a music for 
  Dance Kartikeyya played in heroic Raga <i>Malkauns</i>.&nbsp; It is a somber tune 
  to express heroism.&nbsp; With an abundance of bells and flute the piece almost 
  sounds like a Chinese tune.&nbsp; The seventh cut is an instrumental one to 
  accompany the Dance for Indra, which was played in <i>Bhairava</i> Raga 
  (morning Raga).&nbsp; This beautiful piece is also being included in the list of 
  four songs from the album that could be auditioned by the click of a mouse.&nbsp; 
  The eighth cut is an instrumental number in Raga <i>Durga</i> and <i>Khamaj
  </i>(evening Raga) to accompany a dance call <i>Snanum</i> (The Bathing).&nbsp; The 
  music here is being played in fast tempo with a lot of chimes, bells.&nbsp; It has 
  a flavor of oriental (Chinese) music.&nbsp; The ninth number is a vocal song sung 
  in a Bhajan style whose lyric is &quot;<i>Harinam Ley</i>&quot; (Utter God's name).&nbsp; The 
  10th and the final cut is an instrumental song in Raga <i>Misra Kafi</i> 
  (Mixed Kafi Raga), which is played in early night.&nbsp; The lead instrument was 
  sorod (Indian lute) that is accompanied with a host of other instruments such 
  as violin, flute, tabla, etc.<br>
  <br>
  All in all, the 1937 recordings of Uday Shankar’s troupe is a historical 
  recording of South Asian music.&nbsp; To my knowledge, one will be hard pressed to 
  find a recording of the performing music of that time period.&nbsp; The musicians 
  under the baton of Sri Vishnudass Shirali were: Sisir Sovan, Rabindra (Ravi) 
  Shankar, Dulal Sen, Nagen Dey, and Brijo Behari.</font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><O:P></O:P></span><font face="Verdana"><br>
