  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The year 2004 is 
  fast winding down, it is about the time to synopsize the good things, and bad 
  that happened in my motherland that has decided to tread on a slippery road in 
  the last three decades or so.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why should one 
  characterize 2004, the year, which is fleeting now, as Annus Horribilis or a 
  horrible year?&nbsp; For that, one has to go no further than any archive of 
  Bangladesh’s Internet news daily such as Bangladesh Observer, Independent, or 
  New Nation.&nbsp; One dive into the archive will make a believer out of you.&nbsp;
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh under the 
  “able” leadership of Mrs. Khaleda Zia and an assembly of some anti-1971 force 
  have plunged this nation of about 145 million impoverished people into a 
  chaotic state.&nbsp; Thanks to an Islamist par excellence who goes by the moniker 
  “Bangla Bhai.”&nbsp; The dramatic rise and fall of Bangla Bhai all happened in 
  2004.&nbsp; Some quarters of the ruling party has patronized Bangla Bhai and his 
  Jihadi brigade to unleash a reign of terror in western part of the nation with 
  devastating results.&nbsp; The newspapers in Bangladesh carried some very 
  disgusting tales of Bangla Bhai and his force’s repression on Hindu 
  communities as they extort protection money from them.&nbsp; A segment of the 
  secular folks in that area also had suffered because they quite did not fit 
  into Islamic mode of living as envisioned by <i>Jagrata Muslim Janata</i>, the 
  party of Bangla Bhai.&nbsp; The Prime Minister, Mrs. Zia, after reading a plethora 
  of reports in national dailies had the epiphany at long last; therefore, she 
  ordered the arrest of Bangla Bhai but only to see that her arrest order was 
  blithely ignored by the police chief in Rajshahi Division.&nbsp; What a fine 
  example of insubordination!&nbsp; Thumbing their nose at Khaleda, the police in 
  Rajshahi escorted Bangla Bhai’s men in the main streets of Rajshahi as the 
  marauding thugs paraded the city streets in jubilation.&nbsp; Then, with the 
  police’s help Bangla Bhai and his top lieutenants vanished into thin air in a 
  cinch.&nbsp; In the meantime, the world has seen the bloody picture of a villager 
  who was murdered and then hanged upside down by the branch of a tree.&nbsp; The 
  Bangla Bhai phenomenon never did cause concern among the leaderships of the 
  ruling party.&nbsp; Many an expert in Bangladesh rightfully thinks that Bangla Bhai 
  was a creation of BNP leaderships in the western region of the nation to 
  combat the communists who are also bent on creating lawlessness in the western 
  region of Bangladesh.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Civil rights 
  violations amongst the intellectuals and common men became so rampant that 
  many civil rights group both inside and outside the country rang theirs alarm 
  bell.&nbsp; Consequently, Bangladesh received a black eye.&nbsp; The absolute 
  lawlessness and mayhem created by party cadres of all hues made the nation 
  askew but that did not cause any concern amongst the ruling party leaders; 
  they pretended as if things are hunky-dory allover Bangladesh.&nbsp; In this 
  context let me mention here what did happen to one smart professor of Dhaka 
  University.&nbsp; On February 27, 2004, Prof. Humayun Azad was brutally attacked 
  outside Bangla Academy as he was returning from Book Fare to his apartment 
  located in the university teachers’ quarters.&nbsp; The professor survived 
  miraculously the deadly attack but he was a broken hearted person who could 
  not recover fully from the shame associated with the assault.&nbsp; A week before 
  his death in Munich, Germany, the professor wrote his swan song that was 
  published in Janakantha, a leading Bangla newspaper in Dhaka.&nbsp; In the article, 
  the professor could clearly see what went wrong in Bangladesh.&nbsp; The civil 
  society, government, or Dr. Azad’s colleagues hardly cared about what the 
  professor wrote in blunt language the degradation that took place in the 
  fabrics of Bangladesh society. &nbsp;Many of the detractors of Dr. Azad however 
  heaved a collective sigh of relief as the news of his death reached 
  Bangladesh.&nbsp; With the passing of Dr. Azad, the nation lost a strong voice of 
  dissent against obscurantism and parochialism but that hardly ruffles feathers 
  in most educated folks of Bangladesh.&nbsp; It is a small wonder that the 
  government kept a deafening silence when some Islamists issued death warrants 
  on June 29, 2004 through a fatwa against three secular professors of Dhaka 
  University.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The anti-secular 
  force in Bangladesh is so active that on December 24, 2004,
  <span style="color: black">Prof Mohammad Yunus, an elderly professor of 
  Economics department, Rajshahi University, was stabbed to death inside the 
  campus after dawn.&nbsp; The same professor was attacked years ago in the same 
  campus.&nbsp; Knowledgeable people in Rajshahi University think the professor was 
  targeted for his liberal views.&nbsp; Thus, in 2004, two professors were the 
  victims of the stealth dark force that is hell-bent on wiping the vestiges of 
  secular demeanor of Bangladesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In April 2004, we 
  learned the news of a massive arms haul in Chittagong.&nbsp; Sadly, though, the 
  government could not solve the mystery behind such a big arms haul.&nbsp; It is a 
  failure by the government of massive proportion.&nbsp; Crime in general was up 
  throughout the year and to rid the miscreants from Bangladesh society, the 
  government formed a team of sharpshooters calling them RAB to join another 
  battalion of police by the name Cheetah.&nbsp; Now, many antisocial elements are 
  being killed in the “crossfire.”&nbsp; In January 2003, the government of Khaleda 
  Zia instituted “Operation Clean Heart” to nab miscreants.&nbsp; At that time, many 
  innocent people were killed under police custody and the government said the 
  arrested people died of “cardiac arrest.”&nbsp; The government has fascination for 
  “C” words.&nbsp; What would be the next “C” word – I wonder!&nbsp; The police, Cheetah 
  or RAB regularly kills the citizens of Bangladesh with full impunity.&nbsp; No 
  wonder that Khaleda Zia’s government receives a flunking grade as far as human 
  rights violation is concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From “freedom of 
  speech” let us move to “freedom to practice religion.”.&nbsp; A section of 
  religionists in Bangladesh are hell-bent on starting a sectarian feud in 
  Bangladesh.&nbsp; These “saviors” of Islam think that the onus is on them to save 
  the religion; thus, they want to destroy the minority sect, Ahmadiyya, in this 
  “peaceful” nation of 145 million.&nbsp; The civil society of Bangladesh receives a 
  high mark for taking the onus on them to safeguard Ahmadiyya mosques.&nbsp; In a 
  worst infringement on freedom of writing, the government has banned many of 
  the books by Ahmadiyyas.&nbsp; The government hardly realizes that this action by 
  the government fuels the fire of hatred and gives moral support to ban 
  Ahmadiyya as a bona fide Muslim sect.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The political 
  repression by ruling party against the opposition raised some eyebrows in the 
  international community and Amnesty International.&nbsp; When the Awami League 
  General Secretary, Mr. Jalil, facetiously had proclaimed to oust the 
  government by June 30, 2004, the government rounded up over ten thousand 
  people cramming all the available jail space in and around Dhaka.&nbsp; People’s 
  rights to move freely in a democratic nation were severely curtailed but that 
  hardly bothered Mrs. Zia and her cohorts.&nbsp; The same thing happened again later 
  in the year as opposition was mounting pressure to oust the government.&nbsp; Many 
  civil rights groups went to Supreme Court to challenge the government’s action 
  but given the fact that the court system in Bangladesh had been politicized up 
  to the brim; thus, no remedial action ever came out of the judiciary.&nbsp; Such 
  are norms in Bangladesh.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On August 21, 2004, 
  the nation stood silently as they heard the news of an assault by a stealth 
  dark force that tossed dozens of military-grade grenades on the main 
  opposition party members including Sheikh Hasina and her lieutenants as they 
  gathered near their party headquarters.&nbsp; When Sheikh Hasina just finished her 
  lecture, grenades were being lobbed at her and party leaders; over two dozens 
  people lay dead on the street because of this heinous attack.&nbsp; Still worse, 
  when Hasina was taking refuge in her bulletproof car, the assailants pumped 
  bullets in the presence of hundreds of policemen who became silent spectators 
  at the scene.&nbsp; Few months later, one lone judge appointed by the government 
  published the abstract of his commission to point finger at the intelligence 
  department of a neighbor nation.&nbsp; That is where the buck stopped.&nbsp; 
  Bangladesh’s police is so inept that it could not solve one mystery up until 
  now even though the FBI and Interpol had sent investigators to help figure out 
  who threw deadly hand grenades to Mr. Anwar Chowdhury, the newly appointed 
  British High Commissioner on May 21, 2004 in front of a Sufi shrine in Sylhet 
  and to Hasina and her party leaders on August 21, 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The government 
  announced a price tag of one crore booty on any member of the stealth force 
  behind the grenade attacks but so far there is no taker.&nbsp; However, the 
  government was prompt to catch an honest college kid, Shaibal Partha Saha from 
  an Internet Café on the allegation that he sent a threatening e-mail to a 
  Bangla news daily in which he mentioned to kill Sheikh Hasina within a week.&nbsp; 
  Mr. Saha’s attorney tried his best to obtain a bail but he failed because of 
  the government’s stubbornness.&nbsp; In the meantime, the interrogation team has 
  maimed Mr. Saha and even refused to send him to hospital for treatment.&nbsp; 
  Through government’s action against leading intellectuals such as Shariar 
  Kabir, Dr. Mutasir Mamoon, Dr. Alamgir, reporter Mr. Selim Samad, Brit Zaiba 
  Malik, Italian Mr. Sorrentino, and now against a minority college kid, Partha 
  Saha, Bangladesh has received a proverbial black eye from International 
  communities.&nbsp; Gone are the days when Bangladesh used to be known as a 
  peace-loving nation.&nbsp; Soon, through the action of Cheetah, RAB, etc., this 
  nation of teeming people will be labeled as one of the most dangerous place on 
  earth to visit.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The month of July 
  2004 brought a deluge of floodwater (no pun intended) to Bangladesh with 
  devastating results.&nbsp; The city of Dhaka became an island with no plan to move 
  floodwater through rivers that are taking assaults from encroachers and heavy 
  siltation.&nbsp; Luckily, many civil society organizations inside the country and 
  NRB groups from outside open their wallets to assuage the pain and sufferings 
  of the flood-stricken people.&nbsp; The Mukto-mona e-group collected money to 
  rebuild a flood-damaged school in Roumari, a backwater place in Rangpur near 
  Assam border.&nbsp; This has to be a one bright example of how donations from 
  private groups are making a difference in Bangladesh.&nbsp; In addition, small 
  civic groups such as Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon (BAPA), Bangladesh 
  Environmental Network (BEN), and few other groups were able to host an 
  International meeting in Dhaka in mid December 2004 to highlight the peril 
  waiting to happen if India gives green light to her pernicious river 
  interlinking plan.&nbsp; Both the Prime Minister and the president stayed far away 
  from the conference venue lest Indian Government in connivance with Tata pull 
  rugs under Khaleda Zia Administration and deprive the nation of billions of 
  foreign investment.&nbsp; Mrs. Zia however sent a low-level minister to the 
  conference to appease Bangladesh’s environmental activists.&nbsp; Such is the 
  resolve of this government.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The year 2004 should 
  also go down in the history of Bangladesh for ushering in dynastical 
  politics.&nbsp; Mrs. Hasina Wazed’s son, Sajib “Joy” Wazed returned home with his 
  American wife (probably his greatest achievement thus far) to reclaim his 
  rightful place in Bangladesh politics.&nbsp; He received a tumultuous reception at 
  the international airport.&nbsp; Today (December 25, 2004), I read in the Internet 
  newspaper that American ambassador, Mr. Harry K. Thomas, paid a brief visit to 
  Sudha Sadan to acquaint with the shinning star of Awami League.&nbsp; South Asia is 
  rife with dynastical politics; therefore, Mr. Sajib Wazed has a bright 
  prospect waiting for him in Bangladesh.&nbsp; This scribe does not know where Mr. 
  Wazed had gone to school or what degree he had obtained in how many years.&nbsp; 
  But that matters hardly in Bangladesh, which is run by politicians who 
  received no college training whatsoever.&nbsp; The BNP stalwart, Mr. Tareq Rahman, 
  is a shining star too who did not even attend any college.&nbsp; The return of Mr. 
  Sajib Wazed to Dhaka ought to be news worthy item considering how much public 
  adulation he is receiving after setting foot to his motherland.&nbsp; </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In summary, the year 
  2004 brought a deluge of bad news for a nation that is acclimated in the last 
  thirty three-year of her existence to receive nothing but inauspicious news.&nbsp; 
  It was an eventful year marred with street-level violence, political unrest, 
  and grenade tossing involving British High Commissioner and the ex-Prime 
  Minister.&nbsp; This year experienced a huge hauling of firearms, death of a 
  leading intellectual.&nbsp; However, the bright spot was on private efforts to 
  rebuild homes, schools, etc., after a devastating flood.&nbsp; Dynastical politics 
  also perked its head as the scion of Sheikh Mujib’s family returned home 
  tumultuously to make his entry into the ground floor of deshi politics that is 
  all but calm and serene.&nbsp; He probably will be anointed soon with the blessings 
  of Sheikh Hasina and her lieutenants.&nbsp; </font></p>
