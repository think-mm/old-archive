              This week's page will be devoted entirely to religion. I've 
              reached the point where I just have to unload on this subject that 
              until now I've felt was just outside of the matters that the JREF 
              handles. Since religion shows up as a part of so many arguments in 
              support of other fantastic claims, I want to show you that its 
              embrace is of the same nature as acceptance of astrology, ESP, 
              prophecy, dowsing, and the other myriad of strange beliefs we 
              handle here every day. Previously, I've excused myself from 
              involved discussions of this pervasive notion, on grounds that it 
              offers no examinable evidence, as the other supernatural beliefs 
              actually do  though those examinations have always shown negative 
              results. Religious people can't be argued with logically, because 
              they claim that their beliefs are of such a nature that they 
              cannot be examined, but just &quot;are.&quot; </p>
              <p>Rather than argue or try to reason by their standards, I'll 
              settle for pointing out, briefly, how unlikely, unreasonable, 
              bizarre, and fantastic their basic claims are, dealing for the 
              most part with those I'm more familiar with, from personal 
              experience. </p>
              <p>I frequently receive criticisms from offended believers in 
              psychic matters and religious dogma, accusing me of being one of 
              those dreaded &quot;materialists,&quot; or of being unable to accept the 
              wonders they choose to embrace because I'm &quot;locked into&quot; a 
              world-view that accepts only the &quot;unyielding&quot; and &quot;orthodox&quot; 
              scientific version of how the world works. These words in 
              quotation marks are taken directly from recent scoldings I've been 
              offered. </p>
              <p>First of all, the word &quot;unyielding&quot; cannot possibly be applied 
              to the genuine scientific view. My favourite concise definition of 
              science, one which I admit I invented, is: </p>
              </font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <font size="2" face="Verdana">
              <blockquote>
                <p>Science is a search for basic truths about the Universe, a 
                search which develops statements that appear to describe how the 
                Universe works, but which are subject to correction, revision, 
                adjustment, or even outright rejection, upon the presentation of 
                better or conflicting evidence. </p>
                <p>Science is a discipline that yields frequently while 
                attempting to closely approach that elusive goal called &quot;truth,&quot; 
                but knowing that any conclusion it can arrive at is merely the 
                best one of the moment. Any statement  s = ut + ½at<sup>2</sup>, 
                for example  is &quot;true&quot; when applied to cannonballs dropped from 
                leaning towers; however it does not accurately describe the 
                interaction of very small or very large objects such as 
                electrons or galaxies. That doesn't make it &quot;wrong,&quot; it merely 
                makes it limited. More comprehensive statements such as 
                relativity or quantum concepts, better describe a larger 
                spectrum of physical interactions, but buried in those more 
                advanced statements we can find the former simpler one  which I 
                trust my reader recognizes as one of those given us by the chap 
                named Newton.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The structure of Science itself is also in a constant state of 
              development; ideally, it does not have an &quot;orthodox&quot; state into 
              which it settles down comfortably and complacently. It only takes 
              something like a new statistical standard or an observational 
              innovation to change its approach to any event or decision with 
              which it was formerly  tentatively  satisfied, but the true 
              scientist does not regret nor refuse such improvements in approach 
              or technique, rather embracing them and adjusting to the 
              new-and-better understanding of the world that is now available. 
              Religion, in contrast, is repelled by honest doubt, preferring na&#64933;, 
              unquestioning acceptance. </p>
              <p>It is the willingness to adjust that provides a genuine glory 
              to Science, in my amateur opinion. It is in distinct contrast to 
              the axioms of religions, which proudly flaunt their inflexible 
              &quot;truths&quot; to demonstrate that they &quot;know&quot; certain things with 
              certainty. Yet, the Earth is round, not flat, nor is it the center 
              of the Universe; those revelations were promptly accepted, 
              absorbed, and applied by science  as primitive as it was at that 
              moment in history  and no pain was felt by those who incorporated 
              it into their world-view, though in many cases there must have 
              been some discomfort and surprise, followed by delight. </p>
              <p>&quot;Eppur, si muove.&quot; Even if he didn't say it, I'm sure he wanted 
              to.... </p>
              <p>Yes, I'm a materialist. I'm willing to be shown wrong, but that 
              has not happened  yet. And I admit that the reason I'm unable to 
              accept the claims of psychic, occult, and/or supernatural wonders 
              is because I'm Iocked into a world-view that demands evidence 
              rather than blind faith, a view that insists upon the replication 
              of all experiments  particularly those that appear to show 
              violations of a rational world  and a view which requires open 
              examination of the methods used to carry out those experiments. 
              The decision to be a materialist is my own, I made it after many 
              years of consideration of what I observed, and after reading 
              Bertrand Russell and others. Since it was not a mere reaction to 
              incoming information, but the result of examining that 
              information, I'm proud of my decision. </p>
              <p>(Aside: I'm proud of being an American, a skeptic, and a 
              bright. I only take pride in those things that I accomplished, not 
              those that I was born with or was given. I chose to be an 
              American, and I earned that distinction, I became and remain a 
              skeptic though it was difficult and still gives me problems, and 
              being a bright is flying in the face of those millions who label 
              me inferior because I'm not superstitious like they are. I don't 
              care; I know and accept the real world.) </p>
              <p>As a child, I was told to believe that savages were doomed to 
              boil in molten sulfur if they did not accept the &quot;merciful&quot; deity 
              that was described to me, even if they had no opportunity of 
              knowing about him/it! That deity, from what I was told, suffered 
              from many serious defects that I was told to avoid. He/it was 
              capricious, insecure, jealous, vindictive, sadistic, and cruel, 
              and demanded constant praise, sacrifice, adulation, and 
              ego-support, or the penalties could be very severe. I found, early 
              on in my observations, that religious people were very fearful, 
              trembling and wondering if they'd committed any infractions of the 
              multitude of rules they had to follow. They were  and are  ruled 
              by fear. That's not my style. </p>
              <p>But it was the incredible stories I was told, that really made 
              me rear back in disbelief. For examples, they told me, some 2,000 
              years ago a mid-East virgin was impregnated by a ghost of some 
              sort, and as a result produced a son who could walk on water, 
              raise the dead, turn water into wine, and multiply loaves of bread 
              and fishes. All that was in addition to tossing out demons. He 
              expected and accepted a brutal, sadistic, death  and then he rose 
              from the dead. </p>
              <p>There was much, much, more. Adam and Eve, they said, were the 
              original humans, plunked down in a garden to start our species 
              going. But I didn't understand, and still don't, that they had 
              only two children, both sons  and one of them killed the other  
              yet somehow they produced enough people to populate the Earth, <i>
              without incest</i>, which was a big no-no! Then some prophet or 
              other made the Earth stop turning, an army blew horns until a wall 
              fell down, a guy named Moses made the Red Sea divide in two, and 
              made frogs fall out of the sky?. </p>
              <p>I needn't go on. And that's only a small start on one religion! 
              The Wizard of Oz is more believable. And more fun. </p>
              <p>I keep hearing, from the parapsychologists, the religious, and 
              the occultists, about this unwillingness they point to, a 
              reluctance by certain skeptics to consider the evidence. There may 
              well be skeptics out there who match that description, but I don't 
              know of any. I've heard that the skeptics' postulated refusal to 
              believe, parallels and even exceeds the dedication of the most 
              ardent reincarnation enthusiast, spoon-bending buff, or UFO 
              devotee. I've also seen attempts to delineate the more or less 
              nonrational bases that underlie such extreme positions. </p>
              <p>It's said, quite correctly, that the human mind needs to form 
              an understandable picture of the universe in which it lives; 
              pattern-seeking is a basic survival technique hard-wired into us. 
              We also seek to have an understanding of our own existence, and we 
              often find that adopting what can be described as a religious or a 
              &quot;religious-metaphysical&quot; world-view seems to make it easier to 
              make sense of the perceived riddle of existence. I find that 
              skeptics, generally speaking, eschew belief in metaphysical, 
              untestable, unscientific hypotheses, but credophiles prefer to 
              believe that  when pressed  we skeptics will confess to having 
              adopted at least some degree of metaphysical outlook. This can 
              only be the credophiles' desperate attempt at wishful thinking, a 
              declaration that they cannot believe that not everyone is 
              credulous. It's just something they can't relate to, nor accept.
              </p>
              <p>Here is how the credophiles see us skeptics, and how they try 
              to make themselves appear rational, in contrast to our giddy ways: 
              They will admit that many of them have adopted unorthodox 
              religious positions  and they may include in that list such 
              obvious and ridiculous straw-men as Theosophy and Scientology, 
              just to show that they're not totally bereft of common sense. They 
              say that while many skeptics disclaim any religious proclivities, 
              yet, they add, upon careful examination, they too may often be 
              seen to have a profound belief in what the credophiles see as the 
              &quot;metaphysical doctrine&quot; that they call, &quot;materialism.&quot; This 
              doctrine, they say, denies the existence of such entities as 
              minds, souls, and spirits, and asserts that the physical universe 
              constitutes the entirety of reality. They point out that as 
              materialism cannot be said to be scientifically or philosophically 
              proven, this embrace on our part may be due to a reaction to 
              certain events and trends in the history of science. </p>
              <p>This is a cart-and-horse inversion, in my opinion. To digress 
              momentarily, let me provide here a view and an approach that I 
              have given before. Readers will be aware of the million-dollar 
              prize that is offered by the JREF. Many  a majority  of the 
              applicants for that prize challenge us to disprove their claim(s). 
              We point out that we make no claims, and we only require them to 
              prove theirs; we do not, and will not, attempt to disprove that 
              which they claim is true. Similarly, skeptics do not attempt to <i>
              prove</i> materialism. It is simply the best, most logical, 
              reasonable, explanation of the universe. That's using parsimony. 
              And materialism can be tested  a feature the credophiles often 
              say is not acceptable nor necessary within their supernatural 
              world-view. </p>
              <p>Skeptics do not allow the invention of convenient but 
              untestable situations or entities to establish a claim, nor do 
              they accept that mental or spiritual properties can be ascribed to 
              physical matter, which is the origin of the idea of holy relics 
              and locations. Buddha's tooth, the Shroud of Turin, Lourdes, the 
              Black Stone of Mecca, are examples. Aristotle, upon whose 
              teachings much of Christianity is based, taught that there were 
              &quot;crystalline spheres&quot; that carried the planets and stars on their 
              celestial voyages, and that they were associated with incorporeal, 
              undefined &quot;movers&quot; that provided the forces that kept them in 
              motion. He thought that these &quot;movers&quot; were spiritual in nature, 
              and that the relationship of a mover to its sphere was like that 
              of a soul to its body. This view was amplified by later 
              interpreters of Aristotle such as Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth 
              century who taught that baser matter was likewise conceived to 
              have psychological properties. </p>
              <p>Aristotle wrote that a terrestrial object fell to the ground 
              due to its &quot;aspiration&quot; to reach its &quot;natural place.&quot; This 
              animistic view of the universe is also found in the work of 
              William Gilbert, the English physician. He endorsed the ideas of 
              the Greek philosopher Thales, who attributed magnetic attraction 
              to the action of a &quot;magnetic soul&quot; in the naturally magnetic 
              mineral known as lodestone, the attraction brought about by the 
              emission of a &quot;magnetic effluvium&quot; by the mineral. Gilbert also 
              believed that the Earth itself had a magnetic soul. In its 
              position so near the Sun, he said, the Earth's soul perceived the 
              Sun's magnetic field, and reasoned that its one side would burn up 
              while the other would freeze, if it did not act, thus it chose to 
              revolve upon its axis, and then decided to incline its axis at a 
              slight angle in order to bring about the variation of seasons. </p>
              <p>Do not err by condemning Aristotle and Harvey as poor thinkers; 
              they were not. Other matters they wrote about were well handled. 
              It's likely that if they'd had access to the improved knowledge 
              that was developed after their period of existence, they would 
              have accepted and celebrated that input; they were scientists, 
              though the strict discipline of that profession had not been 
              arrived at when they declared their conclusions. The fact that 
              these fantastic animistic views of the matter constituting the 
              Universe have now vanished as a result of scientific advances, 
              must not lead us to disdain the ideas of the ancients; they did 
              the best they could, and because of the freely-created inventions 
              of their religions  virgin birth and loaves-and-fishes stories 
              always spring to mind  they found no difficulty with their 
              arguably less fanciful assumptions. However, it seems high time 
              for the paranormalists, occultists, and religious enthusiasts of 
              today to accept that their own assumptions are also no more, and 
              no longer, acceptable. We need to grow up. </p>
              <p>Religion is behind so many of the major tragedies of humanity. 
              A new book by Jon Krakauer is titled, &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven: 
              A Story of Violent Faith.&quot; The current perception of Islam as a 
              particularly militant religion  officially fanned and embellished 
              to justify our presence in Iraq, in my opinion  invokes horrid 
              memories of the Branch Davidian cult fiasco and the Aum Shinricko 
              nerve gas attack in the Tokyo subway of a few years ago, and of 
              the 1978 &quot;doomsday&quot; suicide of the faithful in the Jim Jones' 
              People's Temple sect. These are just a few dramatic instances of 
              the effects of religious zeal that made the more conservative 
              believers recoil and perhaps even doubt  momentarily  the wisdom 
              of their faith. </p>
              <p>It need not have taken such sudden, bloody, high-profile events 
              to call our attention to this problem. Other more pervasive, 
              ongoing situations to which we seem to have become accustomed 
              because of their constant presence in our lives, should command 
              equal alarm. The Israeli-Palestinian tragedy, the 
              Catholic-Protestant war in Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka's 
              Tamil-Sinhalese feud, and the Hindu-Muslim atrocities that daily 
              take lives and bring terror and agony to so many, are only 
              continuations of the ages-old confrontations between varieties of 
              religious delusions. Desperate efforts to sustain  by <i>any</i> 
              means  the rule and power of in-place religious systems that 
              insist they have The Way to salvation and eternal life, as so well 
              demonstrated in the bloody Catholic Inquisition that released us 
              not too long ago, illustrate equally well that so much of our 
              conflict is a direct result of the presence of religion. And, in 
              cases of such minor events as local elections, the religion card 
              can and often is played, with great success. We cherish our 
              mistakes, and we defend them. Often to the death. </p>
              <p>And the attitude that superstitious beliefs such as religion 
              are harmless, is quite wrong. Richard Dawkins recently observed, 
              in

                <p>I think a case can be made that faith is one of the world's

                eradicate. Faith, being belief that isn't based on evidence, is 
                the principal vice of any religion. And who, looking at Northern 
                Ireland or the Middle East, can be confident that the brain 
                virus of faith is not exceedingly dangerous?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I have always differentiated between &quot;blind faith&quot; and 
              &quot;evidence derived faith.&quot; From now on, I'll use the word &quot;faith&quot; 
              and not insert &quot;blind.&quot; Rather than &quot;evidence derived faith&quot; I'll 
              use &quot;confidence.&quot; I have confidence in the rising of the Sun 
              tomorrow  or, more correctly, the turning of the Earth to face 
              the Sun!  and I have faith that George W. Bush will eventually 
              cease appealing to a deity or invoking prayer in every one of his 
              public appearances.... </p>
              <p>The credophiles try to establish a parallel between science and 
              religion. This is a useless pursuit; these ideas are <i>exact 
              opposites</i> of one another. No, as Dawkins also writes, 
              &quot;Although it has many of religion's virtues, [science] has none of 
              its vices. Science is based upon verifiable evidence.&quot; </p>
              <p>We find religion in so much of our history, our philosophy, our 
              everyday lives, and our legal system. Miscegenation was banned 
              based on Biblical rules, slavery was justified by the same book. 
              It's convenient to have an ancient set of rules to back up odious 
              actions and behavior, especially when it can be argued that a 
              certain amount of &quot;interpretation&quot;  though never outright denial! 
               is necessary for them to properly be applied to any given 
              situation. In that regard, I reject the tired arguments that try 
              to excuse perfectly obvious errors and blunders of religion by 
              insisting that &quot;it doesn't really <i>mean</i> that.&quot; It means what 
              it says, and no amount of alibi-ing and explaining will convince 
              me that they didn't intend the faithful to actually believe that 
              the Universe was created in seven days. Make up your mind: either 
              it's right, or it's wrong. </p>
              <p>Spare me the argument that we owe so much of our art and 
              culture to religion; that's a misattribution. The great 
              architecture, paintings, music, and sculpture that poured forth in 
              adulation of saints, deities and their offspring, and the blessed 
              deceased, were commissioned, sponsored and paid for by those who 
              offered them as sacrifices, penance, homage, and public relations. 
              Those offerings were items of insurance, appeasements, and bribes, 
              to neutralize transgressions or to obtain a better position on 
              line. They were prompted by fear. I agree that we're better off 
              for the wealth of creative work that we're able to share as a 
              result of this apprehension, but I often think of how much better 
              it could have been if the work had been directed to, and designed 
              for, our species  rather than for mythical beings in the sky or 
              under the ground. </p>
              <p>Well, I thank the mythology for giving me Handel's &quot;Messiah,&quot; 
              but that doesn't make up for the suffering, grief, fear, and the 
              millions of dead that need not have been.... </p>
              <p>Consider: a man believes  beyond <i>any</i> doubt  that his 
              god is the <i>only</i> god, is all-powerful and all-knowing, has 
              created him and the entire universe around him, and is capricious, 
              jealous, vindictive, and violent. That same god offers the man a 
              choice between burning in eternal agony in a fully-defined hell, 
              or living forever in a variety of paradises  some of which 
              involve streets of gold and others an ample supply of virgin 
              delights. Is there <i>any</i> choice here? Will the man fail to 
              carry out <i>any</i> command or whim of this deity? How can we 
              doubt that religion is a compulsory system that absolutely rules 
              its adherents? It's a tyranny, a trap, a disaster of infinite size 
              and scope. I'll have none of it. </p>
              <p>Examine the notion of a &quot;loving god.&quot; This god only loves you 
              if you follow the rules. No questions, no doubts, no objections, 
              are allowed. &quot;Because I said so, that's why.&quot; He/she/it loves you 
              as a farmer loves a draft-animal; you're useful, you obey, and 
              you're docile. If you stray, your firstborn will be murdered, if 
              you don't follow a capricious order, you're a pillar of salt. This 
              is &quot;love&quot;? If so, I'll take indifference. </p>
              <p>Unlike the religious, who have it all cut-and-dried, 
              predigested and served up to them, I'm willing to be shown. But I 
              will not entertain the argument of threats and fear, I will not 
              fall for the &quot;we don't know everything&quot; throw-down, and I haven't 
              the time to argue the endless anecdotal tales of which the 
              faithful are so fond. </p>
              <p>What <i>do</i> I believe in? I believe in the basic goodness of 
              my species, because that appears to be a positive tactic and 
              quality that leads to better chances of survival  and in spite of 
              our foolishness, we seem to have survived. I believe that this 
              system of aging and eventually dying  a system that is the result 
              of the evolutionary process, not of conscious effort  is an 
              excellent process that makes room for hopefully improved members 
              of the species, in an increasingly limited environment. I believe 
              that if we don't smarten up and get a sense of reality and 
              pragmatism, our species will do what they all eventually do: it 
              will cease to exist, prematurely. I also believe that we <i>will</i> 
              get smart, because that's a survival technique, and we're really 
              pretty good at that.... </p>
              <p>I also believe in puppy-dogs and a child's sparkling eyes, in 
              laughter and smiles, in sunflowers and butterflies. Mountains and 
              icebergs, snowflakes and clouds, are delights to me. Yes, I know 
              that this perception is the result of hard-wiring in my brain, 
              along with the added input of experience and association, but that 
              does not subtract a bit from my appreciation of phenomena. I know 
              that others, both of my species and not, may not share my awe and 
              acceptance of these elements that so please me, because they have 
              different needs and reactions. A cloud is a mass of condensed 
              water-vapor in the atmosphere, I know. But it can be a 
              sailing-ship, a demon, an eagle, if I allow myself to be a human 
              being, and though many will doubt it, I frequently do. </p>
