  Is Bangladesh going the way of Pakistan? </font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Pinku</b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The three languages 
  used to spell out the name of Zia International Airport may surprise a visitor 
  landing in Dhaka. Bangla and English, the native and business languages of 
  Bangladesh, are to be expected. But Arabic script? We are not part of the 
  Arabic world nor do many Bangladeshis understand Arabic, save for a handful. 
  No, it is our message to the world that we are Muslims. It is a message that 
  needs to be heeded; even if not for the same reasons that the government wants 
  to advertise the fact. Islamic fundamentalism is rapidly gaining ground in 
  this country, actively supported by the government.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This was not always 
  the case. Less than 30 years ago Bangladesh was a staunchly secular nation. 
  Hindus, who made up one fifth of the population, and a very small percentage 
  of Christians and Buddhists have lived in relative harmony– barring occasional 
  communal strife – for more than a century with the majority Muslims. This was 
  not surprising given that Islam spread in this part of the Indian subcontinent 
  through the peaceful messages of Sufi saints. Islam’s message of equality 
  before the eyes of god was eagerly received by the lower caste Hindus who were 
  born into poverty and were destined to pass on that trait from generations to 
  generations through the caste system. The voluntary Hindu conversion to Islam 
  resulted in a hybrid mixture of both Hindu (native) and Islamic (Arabic) 
  religious rituals and ceremonies that to this day govern most of the important 
  social rituals such as marriage ceremonies, paying homage to elders, etc. 
  Bangladeshi Muslims have owned these hybrid mix as Islamic rituals and not 
  even the strictly religious used to make any distinction between these and the 
  rituals practiced in Arabia, the birth place of Islam.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Pakistan, in 
  1971, decided to punish its restive colony of Bangladesh (then known as East 
  Pakistan) through the genocidal killing and raping of about 3 million people, 
  it prodded its Muslim soldiers into murderous rampages by claiming that 
  Bangladeshis are not ‘pure’ Muslims. The lack of discrimination against Hindus 
  along with the contamination of Muslim culture by Hindu rituals – which are 
  part of the indigenous culture - was further evidence of impurity. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first government 
  of the newly liberated Bangladesh enshrined secularism in its constitution. A 
  decade and some violent coups later the constitution was amended to declare 
  Islam as the state religion. Soon money and other aid were flowing in from 
  some rich Arab countries, particularly Saudi Arabia. Madrasahs - Islamic 
  religious schools - sprung up in villages and towns all over the country. 
  These Madrasahs provided not only free education, but also free food and 
  lodging. In a country where 50% of the people live below the poverty level 
  these schools promised a way out of grinding poverty. Unfortunately, they have 
  also become the breeding ground for Islamic fundamentalism.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Returning to 
  Bangladesh to live, after having left decades ago, I am struck by the 
  prevalence of Islam in daily life. Instead of the “Hello” I was used to when I 
  was growing up, people answer the phone with “Assailum u alaikum” the Islamic 
  greeting. Head to toe covered Burkhas for women and long beards for men have 
  almost become fashion statements for many – though fortunately not as much in 
  the capital as in the countryside. Dhaka has become the site of the largest 
  Islamic pilgrimage place after Mecca, where 2 million people join the already 
  overcrowded urban population of 12 million for a week every year. Mosques 
  spread out in every nook and corner make sure that at least 5 times a day 
  every one hears the call to prayers yelled out over loud and tinny speakers.
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such a religious 
  environment would be bad enough for someone who is not a Muslim, it is the 
  intolerance of other religions which makes it specially dangerous. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Open discrimination 
  and periodic riots against the Hindus have compelled many to migrate to 
  neighboring India. The government-funded universities are being terrorized by 
  the student wing of a religious party in the ruling coalition government who, 
  in turn, are protected by the police. Islamic fanatics on campus, not content 
  with imposing their will on the students, have increasingly taken to attacking 
  secular teachers, murdering them in some instances. Religious zealots of the 
  dominant Sunni sect have been inciting people - successfully - to burn the 
  mosques and loot the properties of a small Islamic sect, the Ahmadiyas. 
  Instead of protecting the persecuted the government responded to these attacks 
  by banning all publications of the Ahmadiyas. The mausoleums of Sufi saints, a 
  gathering place for large number of people attending the performances of 
  street and folk artists on weekend evenings, have been bombed, presumably 
  because the Sufi tradition of experiencing god through love and joy is 
  anathema for the fundamentalists who would rather that people experience more 
  pain and suffering. Even performances of Jatra, the traditional and very 
  popular form of folk play, are periodically bombed. In today’s Bangladesh even 
  being a Muslim doesn’t guarantee you protection from the religious fanatics, 
  you have to be the kind of Muslim the fanatics want; else watch your back.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Interestingly, even 
  though there is a rapid trend towards the Islamization of Bangladesh, the 
  religious parties combined have never been able to amass more than 15% of the 
  popular vote. This seems to imply that the people are not willing to let 
  religion govern their laws or state institutions. However, the influence of 
  foreign money from some Arab governments and pan-Islamic institutions, the 
  spread of Islam among the upper middle class, and the dependence on religious 
  parties in the governing coalition has allowed these parties to yield power 
  disproportionately higher than their share of popular support.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is not very 
  different from Pakistan. More than three decades after our very painful 
  liberation from Pakistan we are remaking ourselves in its image. In fact, the 
  connection with Pakistan is so strong that a powerful cabinet minister 
  recently stated that those Bangladeshis who supported Pakistan in its 
  genocidal war against Bangladesh were blameless. It is as if a cabinet member 
  in Israel says that those who fought alongside Hitler did nothing wrong! In 
  Israel that guy would be very lucky not to suffer physical harm, in Bangladesh 
  the minister is still in the cabinet without having to make any apology. It is 
  not that we are a forgetful people. It is simply symptomatic of the fact that 
  the Islamists who supported Pakistan against our liberation war are the ones 
  who now have tremendous influence in the government. It may not be long before 
  they will hold absolute power and live up to the slogans painted on the walls 
  in Dhaka, “We don’t want democracy, we want an Islamic theocracy.”</font></p>
