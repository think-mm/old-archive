    thanks for your message and for your kind words about my book. I&nbsp;was pleased 
    to learn that it has reached Singapore. I have looked up your website at

    </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><font color="#008000">. It is a fine site 
    and it is especially important because so far there are so few sources where 
    the rationalist world view is promoted from the perspective of an 
    Islam-dominated society. I will suggest to the editor of Talk Reason website 
    to add a link to the mukta-mona website to the Links section of Talk Reason 
    ( </font><a href="http://www.talkreason.org" target="_blank">
    <font color="#008000">www.talkreason.org</font></a><font color="#008000"> 
    ).&nbsp; I have noticed that your website has promptly responded to the recent 
    news about Flew's alleged conversion to theism.&nbsp;While I see no significance 
    in that news item - it does not really matter whether Flew is a deist or an 
    atheist, but what has really made me wonder is Flew's reference to 
    Schroeder's book as allegedly supporting faith scientifically. Schroeder/'s 
    books are full of egregious errors of various kinds, some of which I have 
    pointed to in my book and in printed and posted articles. I noticed that my 
    friend Vic Stenger had&nbsp;addressed Flew's story on your site and partially 
    critiqued certain Schroeder's points.&nbsp;Regarding your&nbsp;request that I submit 
    an original article for posting to mukto-mona, I am honored and will be 
    happy to do so but I&nbsp;hardly can do so before the end of December, as you 
    requested - there is too little time for that and I have previous 
    commitments.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully I'll be able&nbsp;to submit an article at a later date if 
    you still will be interested and perhaps will tell me the desired topic of 
    my contribution. In the meantime, please feel free to reproduce at your site 
    any of my articles posted on TalkReason, either in English or translated 
    into Bengali (or Bangla).&nbsp;</font></font></font></font></p>

  <a name="intro">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. Introduction</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In many articles on this site, 
  especially those discussing books and papers which are devoted to the most 
  recent incarnation of the creationism, disguised as the so-called &quot;intelligent 
  design theory,&quot; or which purportedly assert the harmony between science and 
  the Bible, the question will repeatedly arise of what constitutes legitimate 
  science and how to distinguish it from either bad science or pseudo-science. 
  In this paper I intend to discuss the above question in general, thus laying 
  foundation for the subsequent discussion of that question in particular books 
  and articles.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obviously, this distinction is 
  possible only if a certain definition of science has first been agreed upon. 
  Unfortunately, it seems that a rigorous definition of science is hard to 
  offer, and perhaps even impossible, for reasons which may become clear from 
  the following discourse. In a non-rigorous and most general way, science can 
  perhaps be defined as <i>a human endeavor consciously aimed at acquiring 
  knowledge about the world in a systematic and logically consistent manner, 
  based on factual evidence obtained by observation and experimentation. </i>
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As it should become clear from the 
  following discourse, it is hard to consistently adhere to the above definition 
  of science because the latter seems to inevitably encompass elements beyond 
  the limitations of that definition. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The subject of this article is 
  traditionally discussed within the framework of the philosophy of science. My 
  intention is to look at the problem from a different standpoint  that of a 
  scientist rather than of a philosopher. I envision this as a glance from 
  within science rather than from a philosophical outside. Such an approach 
  entails considerable difficulty. Whereas philosophers may legitimately avoid 
  discussing the specific nuts and bolts of scientific work, a glance from 
  within requires analyzing specific details of the process of scientific 
  inquiry and this may pose a serious obstacle to non-scientists trying to 
  understand my thesis. I will have, on the one hand, to avoid the Scylla of 
  engaging in arcane specifics of the modern highly sophisticated scientific 
  methodology and, on the other hand, the Charybdis of oversimplification by 
  limiting myself only to the most general notions and thus actually becoming a 
  dilettante philosopher.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I don't know if I can succeed in such 
  an act of balance on a thin wire between the two approaches and probably will 
  not be able to eschew the trap of becoming an amateur philosopher anyway.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I also realize that it may be simply 
  impossible to analyze the essence of science as though all of its branches 
  were characterized by the same set of features. Science is very complex and 
  multifaceted so an analysis which is quite adequate for some fields of science 
  may happen to be irrelevant in other fields. My approach will be relevant 
  first and most to such fields as physics, chemistry, engineering disciplines, 
  and biology, while many aspects of my discourse may be less applicable to 
  medical science, and even less to history, esthetics, literary criticism and 
  the like. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the first questions in the 
  discussion of science is what is the driving force of science. While different 
  scientists may be driven by different motivations, I submit that the main 
  reason for the existence of scientific research is the curiosity which seems 
  to be inherent in human nature. This statement does not imply that every man 
  and woman necessarily possesses such curiosity. On the contrary, the vast 
  majority of people lack it. As the great Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin said 
  (he meant only the Russian people, but his words can probably be applied to 
  humanity as a whole) &quot;We are lazy and not curious.&quot; However, there has always 
  existed a fraction of people differing from others in that they are driven by 
  insatiable curiosity. Apparently, some ethnic groups, at different historical 
  periods and for unknown reasons, had a larger fraction of such people than 
  others.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems that historically attempts to 
  satisfy the curiosity in question were made in three distinctive ways. These 
  are religion, philosophy and science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(As any simple scheme, the above 
  classification does not fully represent all aspects of the human drive to 
  understand the world. For example, the above three-part scheme leaves out such 
  important forms of human endeavor as art. However, this scheme is convenient 
  for the purpose of the main subject of this article).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the dawn of civilization, when 
  humankind's knowledge of the world was extremely limited by the narrow 
  experience within a small locality, the curiosity about the surrounding world 
  could be satisfied only by means of religion. For example, until recently, the 
  Indian tribes in America, as well as native tribes in Africa and Polynesia, 
  all had certain religious systems, but none of them had developed either 
  philosophy or science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religion is a way of explaining the 
  world which is not based on evidence but largely on imagination and fantasy. 
  The religious explanation of the world does not require either factual 
  evidence or logic. The holy books of the world's largest religions not only 
  are incompatible with each other but are also each full of internal 
  inconsistencies and descriptions of improbable events, but this has in no way 
  impaired their impact on large masses of people. Although religions often 
  borrowed concepts from each other, most of them claim the monopoly on truth. 
  They have an enormous power of survival despite any evidence against their 
  tenets.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As the boundaries of the explored 
  world expanded, the next steps in the attempts at explaining the world were 
  philosophy and science. It is hard to establish a definite chronological 
  sequence of their emergence. In some cases science preceded philosophy. 
  Indeed, well developed science is known to have existed in the ancient Babylon 
  and Egypt while philosophy does not seem to have left signs of existence in 
  that remote past. In other cases philosophy and science seemed to emerge 
  simultaneously, often being for a while indistinguishable from each other. 
  Whatever simple scheme can be suggested, it necessarily will be incomplete and 
  contradict at least some features of the complex relationship between the 
  three ways of comprehending the world I listed above.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Like religion, philosophy does not 
  necessarily require a factual evidence (although it may) but, unlike religion, 
  philosophy requires logic. Unlike religion, philosophy rarely claims the 
  monopoly on truth (although some philosophical theories did just that  an 
  example is the Marxist philosophy).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, as more factual evidence was 
  accumulated about the world, science took over as a way to gain knowledge in a 
  systematic matter, trying to base its conclusions both on factual evidence and 
  logic.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the course of millennia science 
  underwent multiple modifications, for many centuries remaining 
  indistinguishable from philosophy. The modern science which is quite 
  distinctive from philosophy developed largely during the few most recent 
  centuries.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a certain sense, the relation 
  between science, philosophy and religion can be represented, necessarily 
  simplifying the actual situation, by three concentric circles. The inner 
  circle envelopes scientific knowledge. Its radius is constantly increasing, as 
  more and more knowledge is accumulated. Beyond that inner circle of scientific 
  knowledge is the concentric circle of a larger radius, the area between the 
  two circles representing the domain of philosophy. Philosophy reigns where 
  science has yet not acquired sufficient knowledge, thus leaving room for 
  speculations limited only by logic. Finally, an even larger concentric circle 
  surrounds the two mentioned circles  that of science and that of philosophy. 
  This is the domain of religion where neither science nor philosophy has so far 
  managed to offer good explanations of the world. The inner circle  that of 
  science  is continually expanding at an ever increasing rate, as science 
  accumulates more and more knowledge. This expansion of science pushes 
  philosophy into a gradually narrowing domain where it still has the freedom of 
  logical explanations not based on rigorously collected factual data. This, in 
  turn, pushes religion even further to the margins of the world's 
  comprehension. The enormous power of survival obviously inherent in religions 
  is due not to their gradually shrinking explanatory abilities but rather to 
  their ability to satisfy the emotional needs of man.</font></p>
  <a name="feat">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Features of good, bad, and 
  pseudo-science</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have to distinguish between &quot;good&quot; 
  and &quot;bad&quot; science as well as between genuine and pseudo-science. While these 
  two dichotomies are of different nature, sometimes it is difficult to 
  distinguish between bad science and pseudo-science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bad science differs from good science 
  in that it employs the same legitimate approach to inquiry as good science but 
  at some stage of that inquiry fails, often inadvertently, to follow the path 
  of an objective and/or logical process and goes astray in its conclusions. 
  Generally speaking, good science serves the progress of science itself and of 
  its derivatives in engineering, medicine, and technologies of various kinds 
  whereas bad science is rather promptly discarded. Since bad science is usually 
  recognized rather swiftly, it is often just a nuisance and is rarely so 
  harmful as to seriously impede the progress of good science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A case of bad science can be 
  exemplified by the story of the so-called cold fusion. The discovery of cold 
  fusion was announced by two groups of scientists, of which one consisted of 
  professors of electrochemistry Martin Fleischman and B. Stanley Pons and their 
  associate M. Hawkings, and the other was a group headed by Professor Steven 
  Jones.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whereas I never heard of Pons, 
  Hawkins, and Jones before they announced their discovery, I was acquainted 
  with Professor Fleischman. In the seventies, we both served as members of the 
  Council of the International Society of Electrochemistry (of which Fleischman 
  later served as president). I also twice visited the University of Southampton 
  where Fleischman was a professor of electrochemistry, and gave a talk there. 
  Since Fleischman's research was in a field rather remote from my own, I was 
  not really familiar with his scientific production, but I knew of his 
  reputation as a serious electrochemist. Therefore, when I first heard about 
  cold fusion I was both greatly impressed and puzzled. I was impressed by the 
  mere claim that two electrochemists, using an experimental set-up which only 
  could be characterized as primitive, reportedly achieved a revolutionary 
  result of immense importance. I was puzzled because that result seemed rather 
  unlikely (in particular because these researchers did not observe emission of 
  neutrons from an alleged nuclear fusion process, and, moreover, their 
  description of the experimental procedure seemed to be too vague.) On the one 
  hand, it seemed hardly probable that experienced scientists would have made 
  such an extravagant claim without having meticulously studied the claimed 
  phenomenon, and on the other hand, it seemed equally hardly probable (although 
  not impossible) that their claim was true. Soon, several groups of researchers 
  were busy with verification of the sensational cold fusion reports. Most of 
  them rather rapidly came to the conclusion that the cold fusion effect could 
  not be reproduced. The sensation died and most of the researchers discarded 
  the cold fusion report as bad science. (Despite the disappointment by the 
  evident irreproducibility of the initial results by Fleischman and Pons, some 
  research in that direction is still going on, and regular conferences devoted 
  to that subject are being held; although no actual cold fusion has been 
  reported so far, these efforts may be useful if we remember a saying 
  attributed to Rutherford. This famous physicist was once asked why he allowed 
  one of the researchers in his lab to conduct an obviously hopelessly futile 
  study. Reportedly, Rutherford answered: &quot;Let him do it. He hardly will find 
  what he is looking for but maybe he'll find something else which happens to be 
  useful.&quot;)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pseudo-science, on the other hand, is 
  an endeavor which essentially is not real science but something else disguised 
  in quasi-scientific clothes for the sake of a certain agenda, usually having 
  nothing to do with science and often hostile to science. It may be quite 
  detrimental to genuine science because of its ability to successfully disguise 
  itself as genuine science and thereby forcing on science an unnecessary 
  defensive effort requiring the spending of valuable human resources needed for 
  the progress of genuine science. A little later in this article I will suggest 
  some criteria for discriminating between genuine and pseudo-science and 
  suggest appropriate examples. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems useful to distinguish between 
  the language of science (and <i>definitions</i> as a part of it) and its <i>
  building blocks. </i></font></p>
  <a name="lang">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. The language of science</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The language of science is 
  overwhelmingly mathematical. First, this statement can justifiably be viewed 
  as a simplification. The interaction between science and mathematics is 
  neither straightforward nor one-dimensional. Second, an adequate analysis of 
  mathematics as a predominant language of science would require a preliminary 
  analysis of what is a language. This would, though, lead well beyond the scope 
  of my topic. Third, this statement may be disparaged as allegedly dismissing 
  non-mathematically expressed knowledge as non-science. Of course, it is just a 
  question of semantics. Is psychology a science? Is history a science? Surely, 
  these and many other fields of inquiry are legitimately listed among sciences 
  even though mathematics has so far found only a limited room for itself within 
  those sciences. (A different story is that mathematics finds its way into 
  those sciences via the ever increasing penetration of computers and artificial 
  intelligence.) What is more important, the path these sciences follow seems to 
  repeat that traveled by physics, chemistry, and biology. Centuries ago, 
  actually before Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei, physics used little 
  mathematics and was largely a descriptive science, much like psychology or 
  history are today. It took time for the marriage of physics and mathematics to 
  occur, but when it happened, the impetus for the development of powerful 
  theories of physics was enormous. &quot;Mathematics is a language,&quot; said the great 
  American physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs. Modern mathematics is so multifaceted 
  that it is probably more proper to speak about mathematical languages in 
  plural.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mathematics is, though, more than a 
  mere language (or languages). It is a compressed logic immensely facilitating 
  a theoretical comprehension of experimental facts. Without mathematics, 
  contemporary physics would not exist. Hence, while saying that the language of 
  science is mathematics, this is fully applicable to the physics of today but 
  also, probably, to the psychology or history of tomorrow.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The mathematical language is 
  overwhelmingly used in science not because it is more powerful than the 
  polymorphous natural vernacular. The opposite is true  the polymorphous 
  natural language is, generally speaking, more powerful. The use of 
  mathematical language in science is dictated not by its power but by 
  necessity, as will be discussed in more detail when we turn to the concept of 
  definition. Actually, whereas mathematical language immensely facilitated and 
  accelerated the development of science, toward the middle of the 20th century 
  it has become evident that the scientific study of the so-called large or 
  poorly-organized systems (which will be discussed in subsequent sections) is 
  sometimes impeded by a strict adherence to the rigorously enforced use of a 
  uniform mathematical language. The sharp demarcation between natural language 
  with its inherent ambiguity of terms and the rigorous uniform mathematical 
  language started gradually diffusing.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hence, although the mathematical 
  language is still the prevalent, largely preferred and often simply necessary 
  way of scientific discourse, polymorphous language gradually finds its way 
  into that discourse, a phenomenon which is often viewed simply as a 
  modification of the mathematical language itself. Indeed, mathematics 
  constantly develops new tools (such a chaos theory, non-standard logic, and 
  the like) which help it catch up with the needs of physics and other 
  disciplines in refining their mathematical representation.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question of why mathematics is 
  applicable in physics puzzled many scientists and philosophers alike.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Physics is a discipline in which 
  mathematics is so intertwined with the body of that science that often it 
  seems hard to see where physics ends and mathematics starts. Physics and 
  mathematics have historically developed, constantly exchanging ideas and 
  methods. The greatest mathematicians often happened to be also outstanding 
  physicists and vice versa. Isaac Newton developed some of the most fundamental 
  theories in physics and also invented a revolutionary part of mathematics  
  differential calculus. Leonard Euler made enormous contributions both to 
  mathematics and to physics. New mathematical methods which seemed to be of a 
  highly abstract nature (like functional analysis) swiftly found their way into 
  specific fields of physics while methods developed to tackle specific problems 
  of physics (like vector algebra and then vector calculus originally invented 
  in hydrodynamics) very soon were generalized to become chapters of abstract 
  mathematics.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is something fascinating in that 
  mysterious usefulness of mathematics in physics despite the obvious difference 
  in their treatment of objects. Here is a simple example. We all know that 
  matter has a discrete structure. It consists of tiny particles. It is 
  impossible to visualize these particles since their behavior is enormously 
  different from the behavior of the macroscopic bodies we see, hear, taste, 
  smell and touch. Whatever these particles really are like, we know that matter 
  is not continuous. However, we routinely apply in physics an abstract 
  mathematical concept of infinitesimally small quantities, like infinitesimally 
  small electric charge and the like. This mathematical trick works very 
  effectively despite its obvious contradiction of our knowledge of the discrete 
  structure of matter. The concept of an infinitesimally small charge is 
  contrary to the reliably established facts of the discrete nature of electric 
  charge.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe the described discrepancy 
  between mathematics and physics does not undermine the extreme usefulness of 
  mathematics in physics for the same reason that the use of physical models 
  does not undermine the study of real objects. One of the following sections 
  will discuss the use of models in science in detail. Preempting that 
  discussion, we may note that models differ from the real objects in that the 
  models share with the real objects they represent only a small fraction of 
  properties while ignoring the overwhelming majority of the latter. A good 
  model shares with the real object only those few properties which are crucial 
  for the problem at hand. For example, in Newton's celestial mechanics the 
  model of a planet is a point mass. It has only one property common with a real 
  planet  its mass. Replacing a real object with its model, while introducing a 
  certain, usually insignificant imprecision, enables scientists to tackle 
  otherwise enormously complex problems. Similarly, applying an abstract 
  mathematical concept such as infinitesimally small charge, is similar to using 
  a model in which the discrete structure of the real electric charge is ignored 
  as inconsequential for the problem at hand. Since those properties of an 
  electric charge which are crucial for the problem at hand are accounted for in 
  the theory assuming a continual structure of the electric charge, the powerful 
  mathematical machine works very well, immensely facilitating the analysis of 
  the behavior of real charges.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore the contradiction between 
  abstract mathematical concepts and the real properties of the objects of study 
  in physics is more of philosophical than of practical significance.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Still, the amazing usefulness of 
  mathematics in physics seems to be a vexing problem for curious minds. It has 
  so far not received a commonly accepted interpretation, although more than 
  once various explanations have been suggested.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe that the fact of mathematics 
  being the language of science can be understood through a rather simple and 
  general idea. One of the requirements for an approach to be genuinely 
  scientific, which is not limited to science alone, but is equally valid for 
  any discourse which may be viewed as reasonable, is to be logical. Logic 
  itself cannot serve to distinguish between correct and incorrect statements, 
  because logic is simply the proper path from a premise (or premises) to a 
  conclusion. The logical conclusion is only as good as the premise. However, if 
  the premise is correct the conclusion reached via a logical procedure is 
  reliable. Therefore it is imperative to use logic at every stage of a 
  scientific inquiry. Mathematics is the most powerful and the most concise form 
  of logic. Naturally, science had to resort to mathematics as an extremely 
  powerful tool of logical discourse.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Leaving this philosophical problem 
  aside, we may assert, that, generally speaking, mathematics is the proper 
  language for science. </font></p>
  <a name="def">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4. Definitions</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In many of the following articles, the 
  question will arise of what constitutes a proper definition of the concepts 
  under discussion (see, for example,
  <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/dembski.cfm">A Consistent 
  Inconsistency</a>, sections on probability and complexity). Therefore it seems 
  appropriate to provide first a general discussion of what the features of 
  proper definitions are and which types of definitions can be acceptable in a 
  scientific discourse. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obviously, a fruitful scientific 
  discourse is possible only if certain definitions are agreed upon. Proper 
  definitions are therefore of the utmost importance and introducing them 
  requires the maximum possible care. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems a platitude to say that a 
  definition is essentially an agreement regarding the meaning of a term.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the everyday discourse, we are 
  rarely concerned with the precise definition of words used in the vernacular. 
  The vagueness of the vernacular is actually its advantage, supplying 
  flexibility to the discourse and enlivening the latter. The vagueness of the 
  vernacular is also connected to its redundancy, which facilitates 
  communication. Redundancy, providing a certain amount of excessive information 
  (in the layman's sense of that term), helps to compensate for the possible 
  distortion of the message which is due to the unavoidable noise accompanying 
  the transmission of a message.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Scientific terms, on the other hand, 
  usually require precise definitions and this is one of the features which 
  distinguish scientific discourse from an everyday chat.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A term may have quite different 
  definitions depending on the branch of science in which it is being utilized. 
  For example the term <i>vector </i>in mathematics and its applications in 
  physics means a quantity fully determined by its magnitude and direction (as 
  opposite to a <i>scalar</i> which is determined by its magnitude alone, 
  without any reference to direction). On the other hand, in pathology the same 
  term, <i>vector</i>, means an organism, such as a mosquito or tick, that 
  carries disease-causing microorganisms from one host to another. This example 
  illustrates the utmost importance of rigorous definitions of concepts used in 
  each field of science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Science is a collective enterprise. It 
  is impossible without communication within the community of participants in 
  that enterprise. Communication is predicated on the acceptance of certain 
  common definitions of concepts of which the edifice of a particular science is 
  composed.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Formulating a definition of a concept 
  is a logical procedure which, although it may vary in particular details, is 
  subordinated to certain general rules common for all the variations of 
  definitions. One of the most salient features of a definition is that it 
  presupposes a certain preliminary knowledge relevant to the subject of 
  definition. No concept can be defined unless the meaning of certain underlying 
  concepts has already been agreed upon. If the definition of a concept is 
  attempted in the absence of some underlying relevant knowledge, such an 
  attempt will not provide a legitimate definition, but at best a 
  quasi-definition which will necessarily be ambiguous and logically deficient.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A corollary to the last statement is 
  that every field of science starts by introducing a seminal concept for which 
  no real definition can be given. The word &quot;starts&quot; in that sentence implies a 
  logical rather than chronological order of steps in building up a field of 
  science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are several possible 
  classifications of definitions.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One such classification is based on 
  the logical structure of a definition. According to that classification, three 
  types of definition can be distinguished. They are a) Deductive definition; b) 
  Inductive definition, and c) Descriptive definition.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A deductive definition has the form of 
  a triad. It necessarily comprises three elements which are: a) a <i>general</i> 
  concept which encompasses a certain set A of elements and which is assumed to 
  be commonly understood within the appropriate circle of the participants of a 
  discourse; b) a <i>particular</i> concept which is the target of the 
  definition and which encompasses a certain subset B of elements of the set A, 
  and c) <i>qualifiers</i> which specify those features of the elements of 
  subset B distinguishing the latter from all other elements of set A not 
  included in subset B. Obviously, for a deductive definition to be meaningful, 
  the participants of the discourse must have a preliminary understanding, 
  assumed to be identical for all participants of the discourse, first of the 
  general concept which determines set A and second of the qualifiers 
  characterizing subset B.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A deductive definition also usually 
  contains sentential elements, either explicitly or implicitly, in the form of 
  &quot;such.... that,&quot; &quot;that (those)...which (who)&quot; and the like. These sentential 
  elements can be omitted but they are nevertheless implied.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For example here is a deductive 
  definition of the term &quot;colt.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>A colt is <font size="+1">such</font> 
  a horse <font size="+1">that</font> is a) young, and b) male. </i></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this definition the general concept 
  is that of &quot;horse.&quot; It is assumed to be known to all participants of the 
  discourse. If it were not known, the definition would make no sense as it 
  would define the target - &quot;colt&quot;  through an unknown concept requiring its 
  own preceding definition. By the same token, the qualifiers, of which there 
  are two in this case (<i>young</i> and <i>male</i>) are assumed to be commonly 
  understood by all participants of the discourse, otherwise the definition of a 
  colt would be useless. All horses, regardless of their being colts or not 
  colts (i.e. fillies, geldings, stallions and mares) are elements of set A, 
  while only those horses which meet the qualifiers (i.e. are male and young) 
  are elements of subset B.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is another example.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>Daughters of Ann and Andrew are
  <font size="+1">those</font> of their kids <font size="+1">who</font> are 
  female</i>.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have intentionally chosen an example 
  which sounds primitive in the extreme because, despite its simplicity, it is 
  representative of a deductive definition. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to the <i>goal</i> of a 
  definition, deductive definitions can be of three basic types, a) 
  phenomenological, b) taxonomic, and c) explanatory definitions. The 
  distinction between these three types of definitions may sometimes be quite 
  clear, while in some other cases this distinction may be blurred. For example, 
  a taxonomic definition may be at the same time also either phenomenological or 
  explanatory. Also, a definition may be viewed as either phenomenological or 
  explanatory depending on the requirements to the degree of its explanatory 
  power.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The distinction in question is 
  determined not as much by the contents of a definition as by its goal.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A taxonomic definition is always a 
  member of a set of &quot;parallel&quot; definitions all of which contain the same 
  general concept but differ in qualifiers. For example, the definition of a <i>
  colt</i> discussed above is taxonomic, as it is a member of a set, including 
  also definitions of <i>filly, mare, stallion</i> and <i>gelding. </i></font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From another standpoint, deductive 
  definitions can be either <i>qualitative</i> or <i>quantitative</i>.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us review an example of a 
  definition taken from the elementary course of physics: <i>Semiconductors are
  <font size="+1">those</font> materials <font size="+1">whose </font>electric 
  conductivity increases with temperature</i>.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this case <i>set</i> A comprises 
  all materials whereas <i>subset</i> B comprises only semiconductors, while the 
  qualifier is a certain feature of the behavior of the elements of subset B 
  which distinguishes them from all other materials  namely the temperature 
  dependence of their electric conductivity. This definition belongs to the 
  phenomenological type. It determines the target of definition by specifying a 
  certain behavior of elements of subset B without providing an explanation of 
  why they behave as they do. Assume now that we need a definition of 
  &quot;semiconductor&quot; which is of explanatory type, i.e. containing a reference to 
  the mechanism underlying the behavior of conductivity described in the 
  phenomenological definition. We discover that the mechanism in question is not 
  the same for all semiconductors, so that there are three distinctive classes 
  of semiconductors, in all of which electric conductivity increases with 
  temperature, but the underlying mechanisms of that phenomenon are different. 
  Therefore, in order to provide an <i>explanatory</i> rather than a 
  phenomenological definition of a semiconductor, we have to first introduce 
  taxonomic definitions for each of the three classes of semiconductors. One 
  such class is the so-called intrinsic semiconductors (the two other classes 
  are the donor-type or n-type semiconductors, and the acceptor-type or p-type 
  semiconductors). A taxonomic definition of the intrinsic semiconductors can be 
  given as:<i> An intrinsic semiconductor is <font size="+1">such</font> a 
  semiconductor <font size="+1">that</font> is not doped by either donor or 
  acceptor elements. </i>(The term <i>doping </i>means deliberately inserting 
  into a material A small amounts of another material, B, which alters the 
  properties of A in a desired manner). Now, as the concept of an <i>intrinsic</i> 
  semiconductor has been taxonomically defined, we can give an <i>explanatory
  </i>definition of that concept: <i>Intrinsic semiconductors are
  <font size="+1">such</font> materials in <font size="+1">which</font> the 
  energy gap between the conduction and the valence energy bands is narrow.</i></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This definition is better in that it 
  specifies the intrinsic property of elements of subset B which predetermines 
  their behavior. However this definition, while explanatory, is only <i>
  qualitative</i>. A still better scientific definition would be <i>quantitative</i>. 
  It would <i>numerically specify</i> the meaning of the term &quot;narrow.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If either a general concept 
  encompassing set A or the qualifiers distinguishing subset B from the rest of 
  set A are unknown, the triad-like deductive definition is impossible.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first type of situation is common 
  if a seminal concept of a science is to be chosen. Since at the starting point 
  of a new field of science there are yet no defined concepts in the arsenal of 
  that science, its starting concept cannot be deductively defined. In this case 
  the first element of the triad is absent, hence the triad cannot be logically 
  constructed. A good example is the concept of energy in physics.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Energy is the most fundamental concept 
  in physics. It is also its most seminal concept (not in a chronological but in 
  a logical sense). In a certain sense, physics is a science about energy 
  transformations. The law of energy conservation is the most fundamental basis 
  of the science of physics. However, since physics has no concept which is more 
  general than energy, the latter cannot be deductively defined.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, one can find in textbooks 
  on physics, especially those published many years ago, any number of alleged 
  definitions of energy, but most of them are logically deficient and are not 
  real rigorous definitions but rather attempts at explaining the meaning of 
  that concept without really defining it in a logically consistent way. Some of 
  those quasi-definitions are plainly absurd. One can see in some old textbooks 
  such quasi-definition of energy as one asserting that energy is &quot;the ability 
  of a body to perform work,&quot; which is a meaningless statement, appealing to the 
  laymen's understanding of the term &quot;work.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The famous physicist Richard Feynman, 
  in his excellent course &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics,&quot; prudently avoided 
  attempts to define energy in a rigorous way, providing instead an explanation 
  of the term <i>energy</i> as &quot;a <i>certain quantity,</i> which we call energy, 
  that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes.&quot; (R. P. 
  Feynman, R.B. Leyton and M. Sands, &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics, 
  Addison-Wesley Publishing Co, 1963, v.1, p. 4-1). This is a descriptive 
  definition which cannot be replaced by a rigorous triad because we lack any 
  concept which is more general than energy, so the vague term <i>a certain 
  quantity</i> is utilized to avoid the unsolvable problem of defining the 
  seminal concept.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another case when the rigorous 
  triad-like deductive definition is impossible is when no qualifiers are known. 
  In such cases we know the general concept and know that, in principle, the 
  target of the definition is a sub-category within that general concept, but we 
  don't know what distinguishes that sub-object from other sub-objects within 
  the same general concept. For example, let us say John and Mike are identical 
  twins. Obviously they are two different persons, both being, though, sons of 
  Andrew and Mary. However, we don't know how to distinguish between John and 
  Mike so we can't provide a triad forming the proper definition of either who 
  Mike is or who John is. Any attempt to provide a definition, say, of Mike, 
  will result in a tautology which, although necessarily true, is of no 
  substance (for example, an assertion that Mike is he of the twins whose name 
  is Mike). At best, such a definition can be of what can be called &quot;accidental&quot; 
  type, which is not really useful because it refers to some irreproducible 
  (accidental) qualifiers and therefore cannot be applied under conditions which 
  are in any way different from the specific situation used for generating such 
  qualifiers. For example, such a definition can sound like: <i>Mike is
  <font size="+1">that</font> son of Andrew and Mary <font size="+1">who</font> 
  on Tuesday, January 3, 1978 opened the door of their house when we rang the 
  bell. </i>Although that definition formally is in the form of a deductive 
  triad, its qualifier is of an accidental type and cannot be used to 
  distinguish between the twins at any time other than Tuesday, January 3. 1978.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While a deductive quantitative 
  explanatory definition is the most desirable scientific definition, quite 
  often we have to satisfy ourselves with different types of definitions. The 
  reason for that is not necessarily the principal impossibility of formulating 
  a deductive triad, but often simply the history of the development of a 
  certain range of concepts. If an experimental work generates a set of data, 
  this often provides the basis for formulating an <i>inductive</i> definition 
  of a new concept which becomes indistinguishable from a specific type of <i>
  law of science. </i>(We will discuss the concept of laws of science in detail 
  a little later, but at this point we can note that a law of science which 
  results from a process of induction is not equivalent to those laws which 
  constitute parts of a scientific theory. Inductive <i>laws</i>, which are 
  often no more than inductive <i>definitions</i>, belong to the 
  phenomenological type. They state facts without explaining them.)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Inductive definitions which spell out 
  a law can often be characterized also as <i>relational</i> definitions  they 
  state a certain relation between two or more concepts. For example, assume a 
  scientist studied the behavior of the metal Gallium at various temperatures. 
  Repeating the tests many times, she found that at a pressure of 10<sup>5 </sup>
  <i>Pascal</i>, pure Gallium melts at 302.5 <i>Kelvin</i>. She postulates that 
  her data, consistently showing that result, are not accidental but reflect a 
  law. She formulates a law: &quot;Pure Gallium melts at 302.5 <i>K</i> if the 
  pressure is 10<sup>5 </sup><i>Pascal</i>.&quot; Her postulate resulted from the 
  procedure of induction wherein she proceeded from a set of individual events 
  to generalizing it as a law. Her formulation <i>defines</i> a law and 
  therefore is also a definition. It is a relational definition as it 
  establishes a relation between a certain event (melting of Gallium) and two 
  factors  temperature and pressure. It is also a phenomenological definition 
  since its states a fact without explaining its nature.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even if an inductive definition is not 
  stating a law, the path to such a definition is similar to the procedure of 
  scientific induction wherein the results of observations or experiments 
  repeated many times are generalized, postulating that the data in question are 
  the manifestation of a law of nature. We will discuss the transition from a 
  set of observational or experimental data to a postulate of a law in detail in 
  a subsequent section. At this point, let us simply illustrate the idea of 
  inductive definition by an example.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Imagine that a zoologist whose name is 
  Johns went to explore jungles in, say, some part of Africa, and discovered 
  there a number of animals hitherto unknown. Let's say all these newly 
  discovered animals happened to be various kinds of cats  cat M, cat N, cat L, 
  etc. Each of these cats differs in certain characteristics from other cats, 
  but all of these cats have certain features in common distinguishing them from 
  cats found in other parts of the world. The zoologist suggests a name for this 
  newly discovered subfamily of cats, say <i>Johns's cats</i>. Johns provides a 
  detailed description of each of the kinds of John's cats  M, N, L etc. He has 
  then to provide a definition of the new subfamily of cats as a whole. He 
  defines them as follows: &quot;Johns's cats is a subfamily of cats comprising cats 
  M, N and L.&quot; He may also provide a description of the features which are 
  common for all Johns's cats, but are absent in all other cats (for example, 
  all Johns's cats may have a peculiar shape of their ears, which is not 
  observed in any other cats). This is an inductive definition, generalizing 
  subcategories into a broader super-category.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Inductive definitions, by their 
  nature, are <i>open</i> definitions, in that the list of their elements can be 
  expanded if new elements are discovered which can be included into the 
  definition. On the other hand, deductive definitions are <i>closed </i>in that 
  they encompass all possible elements which can be included in the definition.

  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The lack of a rigorous definition, 
  agreed upon by the participants of a discourse, may render an otherwise 
  sophisticated discourse too vague to be genuinely scientific and may deprive 
  even a very ingenious argument of its evidentiary value. </font></p>

  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5. The building blocks of science</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The principal building blocks of 
  science are </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1) Methods of experimentation,</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2) Data,</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3) Bridging hypotheses,</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4) Laws,</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5) Models,</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6) Cognitive hypotheses,</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">7) Theories. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A warning seems to be in order. The 
  above list may create the impression that science can be presented by a neat 
  straightforward scheme, as a combination of clearly distinguishable building 
  blocks. No such neat scheme exists. The above listed building blocks of 
  science can overlap, intersect and emerge in an order different from the above 
  list. However, the division of the body of science into supposedly separate 
  building blocks, besides providing convenience in analyzing the extremely 
  complex and multifaceted form of human endeavor we call science, also reflects 
  the real composition of science, even though the boundaries between its 
  constituents may sometimes be diffuse.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We will discuss the above concepts in 
  detail. Before doing that, note that for each of the above elements of good 
  science there is a corresponding element of bad science, i.e. bad methods, bad 
  data, bad hypotheses, bad laws, bad models, and bad theories. On the other 
  hand, pseudo-science differs from genuine science not just because one or 
  several of the above building blocks can be characterized by adding the term
  <i>pseudo </i>(which, of course, is possible in principle) but because 
  pseudo-science typically lacks legitimate <i>data</i>. Since data are that 
  part of science which provides evidence, the absence of real data means the 
  absence of evidence which would support the hypotheses, laws, models and 
  theories. A hypothesis, law, model, or theory suggested without the real 
  supporting data is typical of pseudo-science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The statements in the preceding 
  paragraph require clarification of what distinguishes <i>good </i>data from <i>
  bad</i> data and from <i>wrong</i> data. This question will be discussed in 
  the section on data.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whereas bad science is usually swiftly 
  recognized as such, pseudo-science sometimes features a strong power of 
  mimicry, disguising it as genuine science. The litmus test enabling one to 
  distinguish genuine science from pseudo-science is in looking for the data 
  underlying the hypotheses, laws, models, and theories of the supposed science. 
  Quite often, discovering no data, i.e. no evidence supporting those 
  hypotheses, laws, models and theories, serves as an indication that we are 
  dealing with pseudo-science, regardless of how sophisticated the hypotheses, 
  laws, models and theories in question may seem to be and regardless of how 
  eloquently they are presented.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Review a few examples of 
  pseudo-science. Probably the most egregious example of a pseudo-science which 
  had tragic consequences on an enormous scale is that of Marxism. Created in 
  the 19th century Europe mainly by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, it so 
  successfully disguised as science that it won a large number of adherents 
  despite its obvious contradiction with facts. Marxism comprised several parts 
  which can be roughly defined first as a philosophy of the so-called 
  dialectical materialism, second as the alleged historical analysis of 
  society's development (the so-called historical materialism) and third, as the 
  Marxist political economy. The dialectical materialism was an eclectic 
  philosophical theory combining elements of Feuerbachs's materialism and 
  Hegel's dialectics. Neither Marx nor Engels contributed much to the 
  development of their predecessors' philosophical ideas but they reformulated 
  those ideas in the simplified form of a neat set of simple statements which 
  could be much easier comprehended by non-philosophers (such as a vulgarized 
  version of Hegel's principles of the transition of quantity into quality or 
  negation of negation, etc). (It is interesting to note that a frequent feature 
  of pseudo-scientific theories is that they often suggest a neat and simple 
  scheme allegedly representing complex reality). The core of Marxism was though 
  their theory of the class struggle whose essence they themselves succinctly 
  expressed by the maxim that the history of mankind is the history of the 
  struggle of classes. That theory reduced all the complexity of human history 
  to one factor  the struggle of economic classes. Marx and Engels did not seem 
  to be worried by the fact that their representation of history was completely 
  contrary to the histories of such countries as, for example, China or India, 
  and reflected even the history of Europe only in a rather strained way. Such 
  absurdities as interpreting religious wars as the results of the struggle of 
  economic classes did not seem to make the creators of &quot;scientific Marxism&quot; 
  pause and allow for the role of any factors besides the class struggle in the 
  history of the mankind. Their extremely narrow concept ignored a multitude of 
  various factors that affected the history of the human society. In other 
  words, they arbitrarily chose a very narrow subset of data from the much wider 
  set of available data in order to fit the data to their preconceived theory. 
  This is a classic example of pseudo-science, whose main fault is the absence 
  of a sufficient scope of data so that the theory is built accounting for only 
  a deliberately selected tiny fraction of factual evidence. Since, however, 
  Marxism had all the appearance of a scientific theory, its predictions won 
  wide popularity, with one of the consequences being the bloody revolution in 
  Russia. Although the actual revolution and its consequences quite obviously 
  did not fit the blueprint predicted by Marxism, the latter acquired the status 
  of a godless religion, believed in with a fanatical stubbornness despite its 
  obvious futility and the blood bath it caused. Indeed, like in religions, one 
  of the persistent claims by Marxism was that it was &quot;omnipotent because it was 
  true.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another example of a pseudo-science is 
  Lysenko's pseudo-biology which was imposed by decree of the Soviet communist 
  rulers as the only true biology compatible with Marxism-Leninism. Lysenko's 
  theory was a complete hogwash with no basis in factual data whatsoever. Its 
  imposition also had tragic consequences, as many genuine scientists were 
  arrested and perished in the Gulag because they tried to refute Lysenko's 
  pseudo-science by pointing to the numerous data which it plainly contradicted.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One more, this time rather comic, 
  example was the allegedly revolutionary theory of viruses suggested in the 
  late forties in the USSR by a semi-literate veterinary physician Boshian. 
  According to that theory, which was officially approved by the communist 
  party, viruses constantly convert into bacteria and vice versa. Of course, 
  Boshian's theory was based on fictional data. When, after many unsuccessful 
  attempts, a commission of scientists finally gained access to Boshian's secret 
  laboratory, all they found, instead of samples of the alleged virus-bacteria 
  colonies, was plain dirt.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Other examples of pseudo-science 
  include the so-called &quot;creation science,&quot; with its arrogant distortion and 
  misuse of facts, as well as its more recent and more refined reincarnation 
  under the label of the &quot;intelligent design theory.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This theory, promoted by a large group 
  of writers, including many with scientific degrees from prestigious 
  universities and with long lists of publications, and propagated on various 
  levels of sophistication, has all the appearance of scientific research, as it 
  offers definitions, hypotheses, laws, models, and theories like a genuine 
  science. What is, though, absent in the &quot;intelligent design theory,&quot; is 
  evidence. No relevant data which support hypotheses, laws, models, and 
  theories could be found in the papers and books by proponents of intelligent 
  design, only unsubstantiated assumptions. Therefore it can justifiably be 
  viewed as pseudo-science. I will also touch on this subject in the section on 
  the admissibility of the supernatural into science, as well as in other 
  articles on this website. </font></p>
  <a name="methods">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6. Methods of experimentation</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The statement that methods of 
  experimentation are the engine of the progress of science seems to be quite 
  trivial Whereas this statement is especially transparent in physics, 
  chemistry, biology and in engineering sciences, it is valid as well for any 
  other science even if it may sometimes be not as obvious as it is for the 
  listed fields of inquiry.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Galileo built his telescope, this 
  provided an enormous impetus to the development of astronomy. When the Hubble 
  telescope was put in orbit, astronomy underwent another powerful push forward. 
  When Antony van Leeuwenhoek built his microscope, it revolutionized biological 
  science. When the first electron microscope was built, it again revolutionized 
  several fields of science, leading to the amazing modern achievements like 
  actually seeing and even manipulating individual atoms.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These well known examples are only the 
  tip of the iceberg, because the progress of science is pushed forward by the 
  multiple everyday inventions of various ingenious methods of experiment or 
  observation.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In thousands of research laboratories 
  scientists whose names are usually unknown to anybody except for the narrow 
  circle of their colleagues, every day apply their ingenuity and inventiveness 
  to creating new, ever more subtle methods to question nature. Without these 
  often extremely ingenious experimental methods and highly sophisticated 
  experimental set-ups there would be no progress of scientific penetration into 
  objective reality, which often guards its secrets very jealously.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are two paths experimental 
  science takes to progress.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One path is the ever increasing 
  capabilities of devices designed as versatile tools of scientific inquiry and 
  of engineering or medical development, such as electron microscopes, 
  telescopes, and electronic devices (signal generators, potentiometers, 
  recorders, oscilloscopes, etc).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The other path is the design of unique 
  experimental contraptions designed for specific experiments and measurements.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These two path intersect at many 
  points, as designing a specific new experimental contraptions is often 
  mightily assisted by the availability of the more advanced tools of a 
  versatile type.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whereas inventions such as a 
  microscope or radio transmitters and receivers justifiably gain wide 
  publicity, many amazingly ingenious methods invented by scores of 
  not-very-famous scientists usually remain unknown except for a narrow circle 
  of researchers working in that particular field of science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is a typical example. In the late 
  seventies, at one of the foremost research institutions in the USA, a group of 
  highly qualified and trained scientists was developing certain types of 
  magnetic memory for computers. In one part of that study a magnetic wire was 
  pulled at a certain speed through a tube filled with an electrolyte, and 
  certain electrochemical processes on the surface of the wire were 
  investigated. The researchers encountered a problem: as the electrolyte was 
  pumped through the tube, the friction between the electrolyte and the walls of 
  the tube caused the pressure's drop along the wire and this distorted the 
  data. Considerable effort was invested in order to somehow eliminate or at 
  least alleviate the described effect, but the effect persisted. Then a guest 
  scientist arrived who has never before dealt with the experiment in question. 
  At the very first meeting where the detrimental effect of the pressure drop 
  was discussed, the guest scientist looked at the diagram of the tube and the 
  wire moving along the latter, and said: &quot;Why, instead of pumping the 
  electrolyte through the tube, just eliminate the pump, make a rifle-type 
  spiral groove on the inner surface of the tube and put the tube into rotation. 
  The groove will push the liquid with a pressure which will be automatically 
  uniform all along the wire.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is a very simple example of how a 
  fresh look at a problem may suddenly solve a seemingly difficult problem in a 
  very simple way, but this simple example is typical and exemplifies those 
  thousands and thousands of small and sometimes not very small inventions and 
  innovations which occur every day in numerous research laboratories.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The unstoppable development of 
  experimental methods, from designing giant accelerators of elementary 
  particles to small improvements in measuring and observational methods, is 
  what underlies the progress of science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, the statement that a 
  revolution in science starts when the experimental technique proceeds to the 
  next digit after the decimal point reflects an important aspect of the 
  progress of science. </font></p>
  <a name="data">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">7. Data</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><a name="gen"><font face="Verdana"><i>a) General discussion 
  of data</i></font></p>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the words of the famous Russian 
  physiologist Ivan Pavlov, facts are the bread of science. The term <i>data</i> 
  is synonymous with <i>facts. </i>It is also synonymous, in a certain sense, 
  with <i>evidence.</i> Without data there is no science, only pseudo-science. 
  In order to function as evidence, data must be <i>reliable</i>. There are two 
  main types of data, <i>observational</i> and <i>experimental</i>. Both are 
  equally legitimate, the difference being in that observational data are 
  usually obtained in a passive manner, by merely recording whatever nature 
  deigns to display by itself, whereas experimental data are gained as the 
  result of a deliberate procedure of a planned research in which specific 
  conditions are artificially created to force nature to display answers to 
  specific questions. The demarcation between observation and experiment are not 
  quite sharply defined since observation may be a natural part of a designed 
  experiment.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Observation, and even some primitive 
  form of experimentation, may happen to occur in a completely non-scientific 
  activities. In a popular comic Russian poem for children, a Russian orthodox 
  priest counts ravens sitting on trees, just for the heck of it. It is an 
  observation and it is accompanied by a measurement, but this does not make the 
  priest's activity scientific. Scientific observation or experimentation, while 
  driven mainly by curiosity, always has an either conscious or subconscious 
  purpose  to establish facts which may shed light on the intrinsic structure 
  and functioning of the real world.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A crucial element of a scientific 
  experiment is measurement. Measurement makes data quantitative, thus 
  enormously enhancing the data's cognitive value. There is a theory of 
  measurement which teaches us about the precautions necessary to ensure the 
  reliability of the measured quantities and about the proper estimate of 
  unavoidable errors of measurement. This theory is beyond the scope of this 
  essay, but we have to realize that, on the one hand, the data obtained via a 
  properly conducted experimental procedure are reasonably reliable, but on the 
  other hand they are always true only approximately and cannot be relied upon 
  to an extent exceeding that determined by the margin of a properly estimated 
  error.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Consider some examples.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Astronomy is a science wherein 
  observation is by far more prevalent than experimentation. A classic example 
  of highly valuable observational data is the tables of the planets' positions 
  compiled by Tycho de Brahe over the course of many years of painstaking 
  observations accompanied by meticulous measurements. These tables, after they 
  wound up in the possession of Johannes Kepler, served as the data the latter 
  used to derive his famous three laws of planetary motion. We will discuss 
  later the transition from data via hypotheses to laws, and from laws to 
  theories. My point now is to illustrate how reliable data, gained via a proper 
  observational procedure accompanied by measurement became a legitimate part of 
  a scientific arsenal.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A classic example of the experimental 
  acquisition of data is the discovery, in the early years of the 20th century, 
  of superconductivity by a group of researchers in Leyden, the Netherlands, 
  headed by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. These researchers systematically measured 
  the electric resistivity of various materials at ever lower temperatures. In a 
  specially designed experiment, samples of material were gradually inserted 
  deeper and deeper into a Dewar flask on whose bottom there was a puddle of 
  liquid helium, while their electric resistance was measured. Analysis of the 
  obtained data led to the conclusion that at certain very low temperatures the 
  electric resistivity of certain materials dropped to zero. This unexpected 
  result seemed contrary to the common understanding of electric resistance 
  prevalent at that time. However, data take precedence over theories. The 
  scientists of Leyden, however puzzled and astonished by their data, came to 
  believe in those data's reliability and thus announced the discovery of 
  superconductivity. Their data were then reproduced by other scientists and a 
  new law asserting the fact of superconductivity was formulated. The 
  formulation of a law did not mean a theory of superconductivity was 
  forthcoming. It took half a century until a theory of superconductivity was 
  developed. Neither the law in question nor the theory of that phenomenon would 
  be possible without first acquiring reliable data on the behavior of 
  superconducting materials, these data acquired in a deliberately designed 
  specific experiment.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we will see, the path from data 
  acquisition to a law can be quite arduous and prolonged. It involves steps 
  necessarily requiring imagination and inventiveness, because no law 
  automatically follows from data. This is even more true for the path from 
  data, via law, to theory. However, only those laws and theories which stem 
  from reliable data are constituents of genuine science. (The question of what 
  constitutes <i>reliable</i> data will be the subject of subsequent sections 
  wherein the reproducibility of data and the problem of errors will be 
  discussed.)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I would like to illustrate the last 
  statement by an example. In 1994, three Israelis, Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg 
  (WRR), published a paper in the mathematical journal &quot;Statistical Science.&quot; In 
  that paper they claimed to have discovered in the Hebrew text of the book of 
  Genesis a statistically significant effect of the so-called &quot;codes.&quot; According 
  to WRR, the codes in question contained information about the names and dates 
  of birth and death of many famous rabbis who lived thousands of years after 
  the book of Genesis was written. If WRR's claim were true, its only 
  explanation could be that the author of the book of Genesis knew the future. 
  This would be a powerful argument for the divine origin of that book. The 
  paper by WRR caused a prolonged and heated discussion. As a result of a 
  thorough analysis of WRR's methodology, the overwhelming majority of experts 
  in mathematical statistics concluded that the WRR's data were obtained in a 
  procedure which in many respects was contrary to the rules of a proper 
  statistical analysis. In other words, the community of experts concluded that 
  WRR's claim stemmed from <i>bad </i>data. Therefore, WRR's work was rejected 
  as <i>bad</i> science. It was not, though, originally rejected as <i>pseudo</i>-science, 
  because they based their law on certain data to which they applied a 
  statistical treatment (although the latter was partially flawed as well). 
  However, despite the scientific community's almost unanimous rejection of 
  WRR's work as based on unreliable data, two of them (Witztum and Rips) as well 
  as a small circle of their adherents, stubbornly continued to insist that they 
  made a genuine discovery, thus converting their theory from bad science to 
  pseudo-science. Because the story of the alleged Bible code is quite 
  educational with regard to how pseudo-science appears and persists, it is 
  discussed at length in a separate article (see
  <a href="http://members.cox.net/mkarep/fcodes/">B-Codes Page</a>).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, claims such as 
  those by Immanuel Velikovski have been rejected from the very beginning not as 
  bad science but rather as pseudo-science because his claims did not stem from 
  any data but only from arbitrary assumptions. In a book published in 1950 and 
  titled &quot;Worlds in Collision&quot; Velikovski offered a whole bunch of wild theories 
  allegedly explaining many mysteries that contemporary science could not 
  explain. For example, one of his suggestions was that when, according to the 
  biblical story, Yehoshua (Joshua) stopped the sun in the sky, the earth indeed 
  stopped its rotation. Another hypothesis by Velikovski postulated a 
  near-collision of Venus and Mars with Earth, thus allegedly explaining 
  numerous biblical miracles. Of course, there are no data whatsoever which 
  would serve as evidence for such theories, therefore they were justifiably 
  relegated to pseudo-science. While Velikovski acquired substantial notoriety 
  and was compared in non-scientific publications to Newton, Einstein, and other 
  great scientists, no scientific magazine accepted his papers because they, 
  while plainly contradicting Newtonian mechanics, did not offer a shred of 
  evidence which would support his claims. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="rep"><font face="Verdana"><i>b) Reproducibility 
  and causality</i> </font></p>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To be legitimately useful in science, 
  data must meet several requirements, one of which is reproducibility. Neither 
  the reputation of the scientists claiming certain experimental results nor the 
  impressive appearance of their data seemingly conforming to the strict 
  requirements of a properly conducted experiment are sufficient for the data to 
  be accepted as a contribution to science. Data become a part of science only 
  after they have been reproduced by other scientists. Indeed, the demise of the 
  cold fusion (at least as it stands for now) was due precisely to the fact that 
  other groups of researchers could not reproduce the data claimed by Pons-Fleischman 
  and Jones. Likewise, the data claimed by Witztum and Rips could not be 
  reproduced by other scientists, which was the main reason their theory was 
  rejected by the scientific community.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The requirement of reproducibility is 
  based on the assumption of causality as a universal law of nature. This 
  assumption presupposes that reproducing certain experimental conditions must 
  necessarily lead to reproducing the outcome of the experiment. This 
  supposition is of course a philosophical principle to be accepted a priori. 
  This principle has an ancient origin. It was already discussed in detail by 
  Aristotle who introduced the concept of a hierarchy of four causes, the 
  so-called material causes, the efficient causes, the formal causes, and the 
  final causes. In more recent times, the principle of causality known as the 
  principle of determinism was formulated by Laplace, and has been universally 
  accepted in science for at least two centuries.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The advent of quantum mechanics seemed 
  to have shattered that principle. The very fact that many outstanding 
  scientists were prepared to abolish a principle that had been a foundation of 
  experimental science for so long testifies against the claims by adherents of 
  the so-called intelligent design theory who assert that scientists are 
  dogmatically adhering to &quot;icons&quot; of metaphysical concepts rather than keeping 
  open minds.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, the interpretation of 
  quantum-mechanical effects as a breach of causality is by no means 
  unavoidable. Rather, it testifies to the insufficient understanding of 
  submicroscopic processes wherein causality is allegedly absent.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First of all, even in the case of 
  quantum-mechanical events, causality is obviously present as long as the 
  macroscopic manifestations of those events are observed. Recall the example of 
  the alleged absence of causality, namely experiments with microscopic 
  particles passing through slits in a partition. If only one slit is open, on 
  the screen behind the partition a diffuse image of the slit is observed. If, 
  though, two slits are open, the image on the screen is a set of fringes. On 
  macroscopic level, the outcome of the experiment is reliably predictable and 
  fully consistent with the principle of causality. Indeed, the image on the 
  screen is always the same if only one slit is open, and can be easily 
  reproduced at any time, any number of times, anywhere in the world. If two 
  slits are open, the picture on the screen is different from the case of only 
  one opened slit, but it is reliably predictable and can be easily reproduced 
  at any time anywhere in the world. Hence, causality is present as long as the 
  macroscopic effects of the experiment are the issue. A question about the 
  validity of causality is raised when the details of the event on a microscopic 
  level are considered.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If an electron is a particle, it 
  cannot pass simultaneously through two slits. Therefore we could expect that 
  in the case of two opened slits, the image on the screen would be two separate 
  diffuse images of slits rather than a whole set of fringes. Indeed, how can an 
  electron passing a particular slit &quot;know&quot; whether the other slit is open or 
  not? However, the behavior of individual electrons is different, depending on 
  whether the other slit is open or not.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus, the results of the described 
  experiments are sometimes interpreted as indicating that the same microscopic 
  conditions lead to different outcomes, depending on the variations in 
  macroscopic conditions. On the microscopic level, as this argument goes, the 
  same conditions may result in different outcomes thus causality is absent.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Quantum mechanics tells us that the 
  explanation of the described phenomena is in that electrons are not particles 
  like those we can see, touch, etc. They are very different entities, which 
  under certain conditions behave like waves rather than like particles. It does 
  not seem possible to visualize an electron, because it is unlike anything we 
  can interact with by means of our senses in our macroscopic world. Of course, 
  it is well known that macroscopic waves (for example, sea waves) can very well 
  pass several openings simultaneously. Therefore, the two slit experiment is 
  not really an indication of the absence of causality on a microscopic level, 
  but rather an indication of our inability to visualize a subatomic particle.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Richard Feynman said that nobody 
  understands quantum mechanics. To interpret this statement, we have first to 
  agree what the term &quot;understanding&quot; means. We can't visualize an electron, and 
  in this sense we may say that we don't understand its behavior. However, we 
  can reasonably well describe the electron's behavior using the mathematical 
  apparatus of quantum mechanics, and can successfully predict many features of 
  that behavior. In that sense, we can say that we indeed do understand quantum 
  mechanics.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since we can't visualize the intrinsic 
  details of the electron's behavior, we are actually uncertain of whether, on 
  the microscopic level, its behavior is indeed non-deterministic, or we simply 
  don't know what causes this or that seemingly random path of the electron. And 
  since we are uncertain, there is no reason to assert that the principle of 
  causality breaks down at the microscopic level.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Review another situation wherein 
  causality is often claimed to be absent. If we have a lump of a radioactive 
  material, we can easily measure the rate of its atoms' decay. This rate is a 
  constant for a specific material. For example, we can experimentally find 
  that, in the course of a prolonged experiment, the fraction of the atoms which 
  decayed every second was, on the average, 0.01. Thus, if initially the lump 
  consisted of N<sub>0</sub> atoms, one second later the number of atoms of that 
  material was N<sub>1</sub>&lt; N<sub>0</sub>, one more second later, the number 
  of atoms was N<sub>2</sub> &lt; N<sub>1, </sub>etc, whereas the ratios N<sub>1</sub>/N<sub>0</sub>, 
  N<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>1</sub>, etc, averaged over the duration of the 
  experiment, were 0.99. This result is well reproducible, thus, again, on the 
  macroscopic level causality seems to be intact. However, if we discuss the 
  phenomenon on microscopic level, the question arises of why at any particular 
  moment of time a particular atom decays while other atoms do not. All atoms 
  within the lump of material are, from a macroscopic viewpoint, in the same 
  situation. There is a certain probability of an atom's decay, which is exactly 
  the same for every atom in that lump of material. However, at every moment 
  some atoms decay whereas others do not. Therefore, the argument goes, 
  causality does not seem to be at work in that process. All atoms are in the 
  same situation, with the same probability of decay, but only a certain 
  fraction of them decays without any evident reason which would distinguish the 
  decaying atoms from those still waiting their turn.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The described problem of the possible 
  &quot;hidden parameters&quot; affecting microscopic processes is the subject of a rather 
  heated discussion among scientists, wherein no consensus has so far been 
  reached. For example, Feynman maintained that an explanation referring to 
  &quot;hidden parameters&quot; is impossible, because nature itself &quot;does not know in 
  advance&quot; which atom will decay at which moment, or which path a particular 
  electron will choose at a given moment. With all due respect to the views of 
  the brilliant scientist Feynman, I find it hard to accept his position. I 
  express here my personal view of the problem.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In my view, when we assert that all 
  atoms are in the same situation, this is true on macroscopic level. We have 
  insufficient knowledge of the situation of each individual atom on the 
  microscopic level. The deficit of knowledge forces us to discuss the situation 
  in probabilistic terms. Probability is a quantity whose cognitive value is 
  determined by the amount of knowledge about the situation at hand. If we knew 
  exactly the intrinsic details of the situation each atom is in, we could, 
  instead of probabilities, discuss the matter in terms of certainties. Rather 
  than abolish the principle of causality, the much more natural interpretation 
  of the described process of atoms' decay is that there are definite causes of 
  individual atoms decays at this or that moment of time, but we simply do not 
  possess sufficient knowledge of the details of the process and therefore 
  cannot predict which atom will decay at which moment. Our lack of knowledge 
  does not necessarily mean the decay of this or that particular atom occurs 
  without a specific cause.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Actually, an analogous situation can 
  be observed on a macroscopic level as well. This happens, for example, in the 
  so-called Keno game in Las Vegas casinos. In that game, players choose a set 
  of several numbers out of a table containing, say, 49 numbers. The winning set 
  is determined by a machine in which a pile of small balls is constantly 
  mechanically shuffled in a shaking plastic vessel. Each ball bears a number. 
  Balls move up and down the pile, constantly exchanging their positions, some 
  of them pushed up by the rest of the balls, some others sinking deeper into 
  the pile. Every couple of minutes, one of the balls is pushed high enough up 
  from the pile and rolls out of the vessel. The number on that ball becomes 
  part of the winning set. This is a chance process in which each ball has the 
  same probability of rolling out at any given minute. This situation, albeit on 
  a macroscopic level, is rather similar to the atoms' decay. At any moment of 
  time, a particular ball rolls out while the rest of the balls remain within 
  the vessel, waiting for their turn to get out. Why a particular ball happens 
  to get out, but not any other ball, despite all of them having the same 
  probability of being pushed out? We don't have a sufficient knowledge of the 
  intricate web of interactions between the balls in the constantly shuffled 
  pile, therefore we resort to probabilistic approach. However, if we knew 
  precisely all the intricate details of the multiple encounters of those fifty 
  or so balls in the shuffling machine, we would be able, instead of a 
  probabilistic estimate, to predict precisely which ball will roll out and 
  when. The lack of detailed knowledge, while forcing a probabilistic approach, 
  does not mean that the observed occurrence  the choice of particular ball 
  through a chance procedure - did not have a definite cause making the fallout 
  of that particular ball at that particular moment inevitable while for no 
  other ball there existed a similar cause to get pushed out.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The atoms' decay occurs on a 
  microscopic level, and we have much less knowledge about the intrinsic 
  conditions within and between the decaying atoms that we have in the case of 
  the balls in a Keno game. This by no means must be interpreted as an 
  indication that the acts of decay have no definite causes. The principle of 
  causality can be preserved, even accounting for the quantum-mechanical 
  effects.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whatever interpretation of causality 
  is preferred, if there is no causality, there is no science. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="ceteris"><font face="Verdana"><i>c) Ceteris 
  paribus</i> </font></p>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The next question to be discussed in 
  relation to data as a foundation of science is the so-called principle of <i>
  ceteris paribus. </i>This Latin expression means &quot;everything else equal.&quot; The 
  idea of that principle is as follows: Imagine that in a certain experiment the 
  behavior of a quantity X is studied. This quantity is affected by a number of 
  factors, referred to as factors A, B, C, D, etc. Some of those factors may be 
  known while some others may be not. From a philosophical standpoint, 
  everything in nature is interconnected and therefore the number of factors 
  affecting X is immensely large, so we never can account for all of them. 
  However, an overwhelming majority of that multitude of factors have only a 
  very minor effect on X and therefore, in practical terms, most of them are of 
  no consequence for the study at hand. Still, there is a set of factors whose 
  effect on X cannot be ignored if we want to gain meaningful data from our 
  study.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The principle of <i>ceteris paribus</i> 
  is a prescription regarding how to conduct the study. Namely, according to 
  that principle, the process of research must be divided into a number of 
  independent series of experiments. In each series only one of the factors - 
  either A, or B, or C, etc., has to be controllably changed while the rest of 
  the factors must be kept unchanged. For example, if A is being changed, B, C, 
  and D have to be kept constant, and the behavior of X has to be recorded for 
  each value of A. Then another series of experiments has to be conducted 
  wherein only factor B is being changed and X recorded while A, C, D, etc., are 
  kept constant.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, the application of the 
  described procedure is based on the assumption that factors A, B, C, etc., are 
  independent of each other, so that it is possible to change at will any one of 
  those factors without causing all the rest of those factors to change 
  simultaneously.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are two problems inseparable 
  from the above approach. One is related to the errors of measurement and the 
  other to the very core of the <i>ceteris paribus</i> principle, i.e. to the 
  above mentioned assumption of the factors' independence. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The problem of errors stems from the 
  fact that no measurement can be absolutely precise and accurate ( the 
  difference between precision and accuracy is defined in the theory of 
  measurement and is beyond the scope of our discourse). In particular, even if 
  factors A, B, C, etc,. are independent of each other, it is impossible to 
  guarantee that while one of them is being changed, the rest of them remain 
  indeed absolutely constant, because the values of B, C, D, etc., while in 
  principle they are supposed to remain constant, cannot be measured with 
  absolute precision and accuracy. Moreover, the values of factor A itself, 
  which are supposed to be changed in a controlled way, are never guaranteed to 
  have precisely the desired values, and, finally, the target of the study, X 
  itself cannot be measured with absolute precision and accuracy.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The problem with the principal 
  foundation of the <i>ceteris paribus</i> methods stems from the fact that in 
  many systems, factors A, B, C, etc., are <i>in principle</i> not independent 
  of each other. Hence, as factor A is being changed, it may be impossible <i>in 
  principle</i> to suppress the simultaneous changes of factors B, C, D etc, 
  which are supposed to remain constant. Such systems are sometimes referred to 
  as &quot;large&quot; or &quot;complex,&quot; or &quot;diffuse,&quot; or &quot;poorly organized&quot; systems and their 
  study necessarily can be conducted only beyond the confines of <i>ceteris 
  paribus</i>.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Philosophically speaking, all systems 
  are complex, so that factors A, B, C, etc., are always to a certain extent 
  interdependent. However, the extent of their interdependence may be 
  insignificant to a degree which makes the assumption of <i>ceteris paribus</i> 
  reasonably substantiated.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For example, assume we study the 
  behavior of ice/water in the vicinity of 273 K, which is, of course, 0<sup>0</sup> 
  C or 32<sup>0</sup> F. The factor we change is temperature. Besides 
  temperature, the behavior of ice/water is affected by a multitude of other 
  factors. Most of them are insignificant and can be ignored because they have 
  only a very minor effect. However, at least two factors have a pronounced 
  effect  pressure and the purity of the water. In this case it is relatively 
  easy to ensure the condition of <i>ceteris paribus</i>. We can keep a sample 
  of ice in a vessel where pressure is automatically controlled and kept at a 
  predetermined level, regardless of changes in temperature. Likewise, the 
  purity of ice can be maintained at a constant level at all values of 
  temperature investigated. In such a study we find that ice containing, say, 
  not more than 0.01% impurities, at a pressure of about 10<sup>5</sup> <i>
  Pascal</i>, melts at 273 K. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="errors"><font face="Verdana"><i>d) Errors</i></font></p>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have to distinguish between various 
  types of errors. Sometimes errors stem from a basically wrong approach to 
  scientific inquiry. It may be due to an insufficient understanding of the 
  subject by a researcher, which results in an improperly designed experiment. 
  It may be due to a preconceived view or belief, or to a strong desire on the 
  part of a researcher to confirm his preferred theory. The researcher may 
  subconsciously ignore results which are contrary to his expectations and 
  inadvertently choose from the set of measured data only those which jibe with 
  his/her expectations. Errors of these type, while by no means uncommon, should 
  be viewed as pathological; they produce <i>wrong </i>data, which are a version 
  of <i>bad</i> data, and are one of the constituents of bad science. An example 
  of such bad data is the already discussed case of the alleged Bible codes.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, even in the most thoroughly 
  designed experiments, errors inevitably occur despite the most strenuous 
  effort on the part of a researcher to avoid or at least to minimize them. 
  These <i>honest</i> errors are due to the inevitable imperfection of 
  experimental setups and to the equally inevitable imperfection of the 
  researcher's performance. Let us discuss these <i>honest </i>errors in 
  experimental studies. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Until recently, a common notion in the 
  theory of experiment was the distinction between systematic and random errors. 
  While this distinction is certainly logically meaningful and often can be made 
  quite rigorously, lately it has become evident that on a deeper level the 
  demarcation between these two types of error is rather diffuse. Moreover, the 
  error can often be viewed as either systematic or random depending on the 
  formulation of the problem. For example, an error can be viewed as systematic 
  if it occurs systematically provided we always conduct measurements in a 
  specific laboratory A. However, the same error can be viewed as random if we 
  have a choice among many laboratories A, B, C, etc., and choose laboratory A, 
  to conduct the measurement on a particular day, by chance. The deeper analysis 
  of that question, as well as of the distinction between precision and accuracy 
  of measurements, which is a proper subject of the theory of experiment, is 
  beyond the scope of this paper, whose subject is the general discussion of the 
  nature of science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question of experimental errors 
  is, though, related to the problem of causality. If data are a legitimate 
  component of science only if they are reproducible, the immediate question is: 
  What are the legitimate boundaries of reproducibility? It is an indisputable 
  fact that the expression &quot;precise data,&quot; if interpreted literally, is an 
  oxymoron. If an experiment is repeated many times, in each run the measured 
  data will be to a certain extent different. There is no way to ensure the 
  absolute reproducibility of data. The conventional interpretation of that fact 
  is not that it negates the principle of causality but rather that in each 
  experiment there are uncontrollable factors which change despite the most 
  strenuous effort on the part of the experimenter to keep all conditions of the 
  experiment under control.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore the principle of causality 
  is not a direct product of the experimental evidence but a metaphysical 
  principle borne out by the total body of science. Science is based on the 
  assumption of causality without which it simply would make no sense.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore the inevitable errors of 
  measurement are something science has to live with, making, though, a very 
  strong effort to distill objective truth from the chaos of measured numbers. 
  Data which are a legitimate foundation of laws and theories are therefore the 
  result of a complex process in which wheat is to be separated from chaff and 
  regularities have to be extracted from the error-laden experimental numbers 
  thus building a bridge from data to laws. The bridge from data to laws will be 
  discussed in subsequent sections.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems appropriate to discuss at 
  this juncture of the discourse two points related to the manner in which an 
  experiment is conducted.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of these points is calibration. 
  Calibration is a very powerful tool for ensuring the meaningfulness of an 
  experiment, wherein the effects of many factors, which are extraneous to the 
  subject of the study and whose contribution can only mask the phenomenon under 
  study, are summarily neutralized in one step. For example, when Cavendish 
  performed his famous experiment in which he, in his words, &quot;weighed the 
  earth,&quot; he needed to measure the attraction between lead balls. The force of 
  attraction to be measured was determined by the angle of rotation of a rod to 
  whose ends the lead balls were attached. The rod hung on a string, so that the 
  elastic forces in the string created a torque which counterbalanced the forces 
  of gravitational attraction. That torque was approximately proportional to the 
  angle of the rod's rotation. Instead of calculating the forces which would 
  cause a certain angle of rotation, Cavendish simply calibrated his contraption 
  by applying known forces to the rod and measuring the correspondent angle of 
  rotation. He obtained the &quot;calibration curve,&quot; which incorporated all known 
  and unknown factors that could affect the angle of rotation thus eliminating 
  in one step  calibration  most of the sources of error. Calibration in 
  various forms is routinely used in scientific experiments whenever possible, 
  thus substantially eliminating many sources of error.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another point to discuss is the 
  difference between the discrete and the continual methods of recording 
  experimental data. Each of these two methods has both advantages and 
  shortcomings.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If a discrete recording is employed, 
  the target of study - X - is measured for a set of discrete values of the 
  controlled parameter A, while all other parameters affecting X are kept 
  constant. Factor A is given values A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub> 2 ,</sub>A<sub> 3
  </sub>etc, and at each of those values of A, X is measured, yielding a set X<sub>1</sub>, 
  X<sub>2</sub> , X<sub>3</sub> , etc.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a shortcoming of such method, it is 
  often asserted that there is never certainty regarding the values of X between 
  the measured points. However close the values of A at which X is measured are, 
  there are always gaps between those values of X, and to fill those gaps the 
  researcher has an infinitely large number of choices. It is often expressed as 
  an assertion that there are infinitely many curves which can be drawn through 
  the same set of experimental points, regardless of how close those points are 
  to each other. (Of course, a more accurate assertion should be that the curves 
  may be drawn through the margins of error surrounding each experimental 
  point).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While the above assertion is certainly 
  correct in an abstract philosophical way, it rarely has serious practical 
  implications, as will be discussed in the section on the bridging hypotheses.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The mentioned shortcoming of the 
  discrete method of experiment seems to be eliminated if a continual method is 
  employed instead. In this method, the controlled factor A (or often several 
  controlled factors A, B, C, etc.) are being continually changed at a certain 
  rate, while the values of the target of the study, X, are simultaneously and 
  continually recorded.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An obvious advantage of this method is 
  the substantial saving of time and effort necessary to accumulate information 
  about the phenomenon under study. The wide availability of sophisticated 
  recording equipment in the 20th century made continual recording the favorite 
  method of experimental work in physics, chemistry and other fields of study.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the method of continual 
  recording generates continuous curves rather than sets of experimental points, 
  it may seem to eliminate the arbitrariness involved in drawing curves through 
  discrete experimental points. Unfortunately, this supposed advantage of the 
  continual method is illusory. The illusion is related to the problem of a 
  system's <i>response time</i> to a perturbation, i.e. to an abrupt change of 
  parameters. If any parameter affecting the system's behavior is abruptly 
  changed, it sets in motion a process of the system's transition to a new 
  state, this process proceeding with a certain finite speed. If a system was in 
  a state wherein X had a certain value X<sub>1</sub> while factor A had the 
  value A<sub>1</sub>, and at some moment of time t<sub>1</sub> parameter A is 
  changed to A<sub>2</sub>, the system's measured property X does not instantly 
  jump to a new value X<sub>2</sub>, but rather undergoes a transition to the 
  new value which takes a certain time (&quot;relaxation period&quot;). Therefore the 
  experimental curves reflecting the functional dependence of X on A will have 
  different shapes depending on the rate at which A is being altered by the 
  experimental set-up. In a discrete method of experiment normally the time 
  interval between consecutive measurements of X is sufficiently large for X to 
  complete the transition to the new equilibrium value. In continual recording, 
  depending on the rate of change of A, the transition of X to the new 
  equilibrium value is often not yet completed as A already shifts to new 
  values. It is well known that, for example, the loops of magnetic hysteresis 
  are very different depending on the rate of the magnetizing field's change.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In connection with the question of 
  experimental errors, the notion of noise seems to be relevant. The term noise 
  entered science from information/communication theory. That branch of science 
  studies the transmission of information (of &quot;signals&quot;) which is inevitably 
  accompanied by noise in the elements of the transmission channel. The noise is 
  superimposed on the useful signal and has to be filtered out if the signal is 
  to be reliably interpreted. The term noise gradually gained a wider use, 
  referring to any unintended extraneous input to the experimental setup. 
  Normally, to extract useful data from the experimental output the desired data 
  have to be distilled from the overall output by excising noise. However, more 
  than once noise happened to be the source of scientific discoveries. For 
  example, when, at the end of the 19th century, physicists studied the 
  processes in a cathode ray tube, these processes were always accompanied by 
  emission of a certain radiation from the walls of the tube. Some researchers 
  did not notice these rays, others did but viewed them just as noise and 
  ignored them. Then Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, who specialized in the study of 
  dielectrics, and was generally highly meticulous in his research, looked at 
  the &quot;noise&quot; as a phenomenon interesting in itself. He very thoroughly studied 
  the phenomenon which his predecessors dismissed as just a nuisance and thus 
  became the discoverer of that important type of radiation which he called 
  X-rays. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another well known example of how a 
  phenomenon which was viewed as annoying noise led to an important discovery is 
  that of the background cosmic radiation discovered in 1965 by Arno Penzias and 
  Robert Wilson.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Generally speaking, if an experiment 
  yields results which could be predicted, this adds little to the progress of 
  science. The matter becomes really interesting if the results of an experiment 
  look absurd. If a researcher encounters an absurd result, which persists 
  despite efforts to clean up the experiment and to eliminate possible sources 
  of error, there is a good chance the researcher has come across something 
  novel and therefore interesting. The absurd outcomes may often be attributed 
  to noise, but not too rarely that noise carries information about a hitherto 
  unknown effect or can be utilized in an unconventional way for a deeper study 
  of the phenomenon.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me give an example from my 
  personal experience.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many years ago I studied the process 
  of adsorption of various molecules on the surface of metallic and 
  semiconductor electrodes. One of the methods of that study was the measurement 
  of the so-called differential capacity of the electric double layer on the 
  electrode surface. A couple of my students participating in that research 
  built a setup enabling us to measure the differential capacity at various 
  values of the electric potential imposed on the electrode. After having worked 
  with that setup for several weeks, they became grossly frustrated by their 
  inability to eliminate the instability of the measured capacity. Each time 
  they changed the value of the electrode potential, the differential capacity 
  started shifting and they had to wait for many hours and sometimes days until 
  a new, uncertain equilibrium seemed to set in. They viewed this unpredicted 
  &quot;instability&quot; of the measured differential capacity as annoying noise 
  preventing them from performing the desired measurement. They complained to me 
  about their frustrating experience and asked for advice - how to get rid of 
  it. I remember that moment when a kind of a sudden light exploded in my mind 
  and I shouted, &quot;Lads, it is wonderful! We got an unexpected result.&lt; The 
  capacity creeps  and this means that if you accurately measure the curve of 
  capacity versus time, this curve will contain plenty of information about the 
  kinetics of the adsorption process!&quot; I set out to develop equations reflecting 
  the relaxation process of the capacity. A new method of scientific study we 
  named potentiostatic chronofaradometry was thus born. Instead of trying to 
  eliminate the supposed noise and routinely measure the supposed equilibrium 
  values of the differential capacity, now my students concentrated on measuring 
  those very relaxation curves which they angrily considered to be annoying 
  noise. Plenty of information about the kinetics of the adsorption/desorption 
  process was extracted from that &quot;noise,&quot; assisted by the equations derived for 
  that process. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><a name="complex"><font face="Verdana"><i>e) Complex 
  systems </i></font></p>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For over 200 years, one of the 
  underlying hypotheses of science, often unspoken, was that every system which 
  is a subject of a scientific study is &quot;well organized,&quot; in the sense that it 
  was always possible to separate a few phenomena or processes of similar 
  nature, dependent on a limited set of important factors, in such a way that 
  the system's behavior could be studied by isolating factors one by one, 
  finding the functional dependencies between pairs of factors, and attributing 
  to those functional dependencies the status of laws. In the 20th century the 
  described approach started encountering serious difficulties. In many systems 
  the separation of various factors turned out to be impossible. Science 
  encountered the ever increasing number of what is referred to as &quot;large&quot; 
  systems, or &quot;poorly organized systems,&quot; or &quot;diffuse systems,&quot; etc., reflecting 
  various aspects of such systems' behavior. Such systems cannot be legitimately 
  studied under the <i>ceteris paribus </i>approach because it is impossible to 
  separately and controllably vary any one parameter affecting the system 
  without causing a simultaneous variation of other parameters.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It should be noted that the concept of 
  a &quot;large&quot; or &quot;poorly organized&quot; system is not equivalent to the concept of <i>
  stochastic</i> systems. The latter were well known and successfully dealt with 
  in 19th century physics. An example of a stochastic system is a gas occupying 
  a certain volume. It consists of an enormous number of molecules (for example, 
  at atmospheric pressure and room temperature 1cubic centimeter of gas contains 
  about 10<sup>19</sup> molecules). The behavior of each molecule is determined 
  by the laws of Newton's mechanics. However, because of the immense number of 
  molecules, it is impossible to analyze the behavior of gas by solving the 
  equations of mechanical motion for each molecule. Therefore, 19th century 
  science came up with very powerful statistical methods which enabled it to 
  analyze the behavior of a gas without a detailed analysis of the motion of 
  each individual molecule. (There are theories according to which a system 
  already becomes stochastic, i.e., not treatable by studying the behavior of 
  its individual elements, if the number of these elements exceeds about 30.)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, stochastic systems such as 
  gases behave stochastically only on a microscopic level. On a macroscopic 
  level they can be easily treated using the <i>ceteris paribus</i> approach. 
  Macroscopic properties of a gas, such as pressure, temperature, volume, etc., 
  can be very well studied by isolating and controllably changing these 
  properties one by one while keeping the rest of the properties constant. This 
  is possible because the immense number of elements of such systems does not 
  translate into a large number of macroscopic properties. A gas containing 
  quadrillion quadrillions of microscopic molecules, all of them identical, 
  macroscopically is characterized only by a few parameters, such as pressure, 
  temperature and volume.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, the &quot;large,&quot; or 
  &quot;poorly organized&quot; systems are characterized by a very large number of <i>
  macroscopic parameters</i>, many of which cannot be individually varied 
  without simultaneously changing some other parameters affecting the system.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Historically, one of the situations 
  whose study mightily served the realization of the ineliminable 
  interdependence of various parameters in a &quot;poorly-organized&quot; system is 
  emission spectral analysis. A good description of the problems encountered 
  when trying to interpret the data obtained via emission spectral analysis was 
  given in a book &quot;Teoriya Eksperimenta&quot; (The Theory of Experiment) by Vasily V. 
  Nalimov (Nauka Publishers, Moscow 1971; in Russian).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In that process, a sample of material 
  to be studied is placed between two electrodes into which a high voltage is 
  fed. The breakdown of the gap between the electrodes causes a spark discharge 
  wherein the temperature reaches tens of thousands of Kelvin. The density of 
  energy at certain locations on the electrodes reaches a huge level. An 
  explosive evaporation occurs, followed by an equilibrium evaporation. A cloud 
  of evaporated matter is created between the electrodes in which simultaneous 
  processes of diffusion, excitation and radiation take place. Besides, 
  oxidation/reduction processes occur on the electrodes' surface, and diffusion 
  of elements occurs in their bulk, dependent on the temperature gradient, phase 
  composition of electrode material, defects etc. All these processes are of a 
  periodic nature, on which a one-directional drift is imposed by the 
  electrodes' erosion. Attempts to analyze the described extremely complex 
  combination of phenomena by means of separating various factors one by one 
  turned out to be in vain. The system is too complex and therefore its analysis 
  forced scientists to give up attempts to proceed using the <i>ceteris paribus
  </i>approach.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To study the &quot;large&quot; or &quot;complex&quot; 
  systems, the science of the 20th century developed two main approaches. One is 
  the multi-dimensional statistical approach and the other is the cybernetic (or 
  computer-modeling) approach.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since this article is not about the 
  theory of experiment but about a general discussion of the nature of science, 
  I will discuss the above two approaches very briefly and only in rather 
  general terms.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The statistical approach was to large 
  extent initiated by the British mathematician R. A. Fisher. It is often 
  referred to as multi-dimensional mathematical statistics (MDMS). Essentially, 
  MDMS is a logically substantiated formalization of such an approach to the 
  study of &quot;large&quot; systems wherein the researcher deliberately avoids a detailed 
  penetration into intricate mechanisms of a complex phenomenon, resorting 
  instead to its statistical analysis using multiple variables.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The application of MDMS requires 
  solving a number of problems involving the appropriate strategy of an 
  experiment - the proper choice of the essential parameters - since accounting 
  for too many parameters may make the task beyond the available intellectual 
  and computational resources, while accounting for too few parameters may 
  reduce the solution to a triviality. The effectiveness of MDMS has been 
  drastically improving along with the availability of ever more powerful 
  computers and software. Statistical models of complex systems have been 
  successfully employed for a multitude of problems which could not be tackled 
  by the traditional methods of direct measurement.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The cybernetic approach, whose origin 
  can be attributed to Norbert Wiener, is in some respects very different from 
  the statistical one, although it also has become really useful only with the 
  advent of powerful computers. While the method of multi-dimensional statistics 
  and that of a computer modeling are principally different, both are 
  successfully applied, sometimes to the study of the same &quot;complex&quot; system.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The cybernetic approach makes no sense 
  as long as only simple &quot;well organized&quot; systems are studied. In such systems 
  one-dimensional functional connections fully determine the system's behavior 
  and the problem of control (management) is moot. For example, the motions of 
  planets are fully determined by Kepler's laws. On the other hand, control of 
  the behavior of a &quot;poorly organized,&quot; or &quot;large&quot; system, which is quite 
  challenging, can be fruitfully approached via a cybernetic model. (Various 
  meanings of the term <i>model</i> will be discussed in the section on models 
  in science).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the frontiers of modern science 
  is the field of artificial intelligence which exemplifies the cybernetic 
  approach to a &quot;complex&quot; system (human intellect) by using a computer model of 
  the latter.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Biological systems are mostly &quot;large&quot; 
  or &quot;poorly organized&quot; in the above formulated sense.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another example of a &quot;large&quot; system is 
  the economy of any country.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In every country there is a multitude 
  of factories, farms, companies and individuals each pursuing its/his 
  particular economic interests, All these elements of the economic system 
  interact among themselves in an immensely complicated web of transactions, 
  changing every moment so that this enormously complex system is in a constant 
  flux whose trends are usually not obvious. It is impossible to account for 
  each and all features of that immensely complex game, not only because of its 
  sheer size and the huge number of its constituent elements, but also because 
  of its unstable character. Before the available data about the state of 
  economy have been digested and interpreted, they have already changed. No 
  computer, however powerful, can follow all the nuances of the economic game. 
  Therefore the economy cannot be in principle &quot;scientifically managed&quot; as it 
  supposedly was in the allegedly &quot;socialist planned economy&quot; of the former 
  USSR. This was one of the reasons for the abysmal failure of the &quot;socialist 
  economy,&quot; which was no more scientific than it was really socialist. The 
  actual economic system in the former USSR was &quot;state capitalism,&quot; with all the 
  drawbacks of an extreme form of a monopolistic capitalist system but without 
  the advantages of a free enterprise. The attempts to sustain a planned economy 
  allegedly based on a scientific analysis of the resources, demands and 
  supplies, resulted in a seemingly controlled but actually chaotic economy 
  wherein stealing and cheating became the only possible means of survival for 
  the powerless slaves of the state.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pretending to maintain a 
  scientifically planned economy, as Marxist theory required, actually resulted 
  in a system that was contrary to elementary basics of science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The economy of the modern world 
  functions in a cyclic manner, following its own poorly understood complex 
  statistical laws wherein its oscillatory motions have an immense inertia, so 
  that attempts to steer it in this or that direction (for example, by 
  regulating the interest rate or changing the tax laws) have only a marginal 
  effect on the waves of prosperity and recession replacing each other as if by 
  their own will.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Large (or diffuse) systems require for 
  their analysis specific approaches, and 20th century science has provided 
  these approaches in the two above mentioned ways. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whatever method is used to acquire 
  data, either the traditional multi-step measurement under the <i>ceteris 
  paribus</i> principle, or the application of multi-dimensional statistics, or 
  a computer model, or any other approach, the acquisition of reliable data is 
  an ineliminable step in the scientific method. It is possible to apply the 
  scientific approach without strict definitions or without good hypotheses or 
  without good models or without good theories (although omitting any of the 
  listed components would seriously impair the quality of the scientific study, 
  often making it bad science). It is impossible to have any science, good or 
  bad, without reliable data. In the absence of data, the endeavor, however 
  cleverly disguised and eloquently offered, can only be pseudo-science. </font>

  <a name="bridging">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">8. Bridging hypotheses</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Perhaps, the title of this section 
  should more appropriately be &quot;Bridging Hypothesis,&quot; in the singular, because 
  this hypothesis is essentially always the same. This hypothesis postulates the 
  objective existence of a <i>law.</i> It constitutes a &quot;bridge&quot; from the raw 
  data to the postulated law.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the case of &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;well 
  organized&quot; systems which can be studied under the <i>ceteris paribus</i> 
  condition, the bridging hypothesis appears in its most explicit form, while in 
  the case of &quot;large&quot; or &quot;poorly organized&quot; systems it can often be hidden 
  within the complex web of the data themselves.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Imagine an experiment under the <i>
  ceteris paribus</i> assumption wherein a set of values of a target quantity X 
  has been measured for a set of values of a parameter A, so for each value of A<sub>1</sub>, 
  A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, etc., corresponding values X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, 
  X<sub>3</sub>,etc., have been measured and also the margin of error ±&#916; has 
  been estimated so that every value of X<sub>i</sub> is believed to be within 
  the margin of X<sub>i</sub> ±&#916;. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For the sake of example, assume that 
  the measured values of X are found to increase along with the increase of the 
  corresponding values of A. Every set of X and A, however extensive, is always 
  still only a selected subset of all possible values of X and A.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Reviewing the sets of measured 
  numbers, we try to discern a regularity connecting A and X. To do so we have 
  necessarily to <i>assume</i> that the set of actually measured numbers indeed 
  reflects an objective regularity. There is never unequivocal proof that such a 
  regularity indeed objectively exists, we have necessarily to postulate it <i>
  before</i> formulating a <i>law</i>.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">More often than not such a hypothesis 
  is implicitly present without being explicitly spelled out. In scientific 
  papers we, quite usually, see statements introducing a law, without mentioning 
  the bridging hypothesis. The researchers reporting their results routinely 
  assert that, for example, &quot;as our data show, in the interval between A<sub>1</sub> 
  and A<sub>k</sub>, X increases proportionally to A.&quot; This statement is that of 
  a law. In fact, though, such statement of a law might not be legitimately made 
  without first postulating the very objective existence of a law connecting X 
  to A. The bridging hypothesis according to which the observed sets of values 
  of X correspond to the selected sets of values of A, not as an accidental 
  result of an experiment conducted under a limited set of conditions but 
  because of an objectively functioning law, must necessarily precede, if often 
  subconsciously, the statement of a law.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The hypothesis in question, which is 
  necessarily present, most often implicitly, in the procedure of claiming a 
  law, is never more than a hypothesis and cannot be proven. Fortunately it 
  happens to be true, at least as an approximation, in the vast number of 
  situations, thus constituting a reliable building block of science. In fact, 
  if sets of As and of Xs seem to match each other according to some regularity, 
  more often than not such a regularity does indeed exists, although sometimes 
  it also </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, the bridging hypothesis is 
  not applied if no law is postulated. A researcher may obtain sets of values of 
  the measured quantity X corresponding to a set of values of a parameter A 
  which may look like a display of a regularity, but for various reasons she may 
  reject the bridging hypothesis and avoid an attempt to spell out a pertinent 
  law. The reasons for that may be, for example, some firmly established 
  theoretical concepts making the law in question very unlikely, or serious 
  doubts regarding the elimination of some extraneous factors which could 
  distort the data thus creating the false appearance of a regularity, or any 
  number of other reasons.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">More often, though, a scientist may be 
  just uncertain in regard to the choice between accepting or rejecting the 
  bridging hypothesis rather than flatly rejecting it. Often such uncertainty is 
  based simply on the insufficiently complete data. The researcher is uncertain 
  whether or not the available sets of data do indeed properly represent the 
  entire multiplicity of possible data.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If that is the case, the proper remedy 
  is to resort to a statistical study of the phenomenon in question. The proper 
  tool for such a study is the part of mathematical statistics called 
  &quot;hypotheses testing.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The procedure involves introducing two 
  competing hypotheses, one called the &quot;null hypothesis,&quot; and the other the 
  &quot;alternative hypothesis.&quot; The null hypothesis is the assumption that the 
  available set of data does not represent a law. The alternative hypothesis is 
  in this case a synonym for what I called the bridging hypothesis, i.e. the 
  assumption that the available set of data reflects a law. As a result of a 
  proper statistical test, the researcher compares the likelihood of the null 
  hypothesis vs. the likelihood of the alternative hypothesis. The hypothesis 
  whose likelihood is larger, is accepted, while the other hypothesis is 
  rejected. This choice is never assured to be ultimately correct, since 
  discovery of additional data may change the likelihood of the competing 
  hypotheses. In this sense, laws of science are usually referred to as 
  tentative.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fortunately, the rigorous 
  self-verification inherent in a proper scientific procedure makes a vast 
  number of laws of science work very well despite their &quot;tentative&quot; character. 
  In the next section we will discuss the laws more in detail. </font></p>
  <a name="laws">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">9. Laws</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whereas the bridging hypothesis 
  discussed in the previous section is simple and uniform in that its gist is 
  simply in assuming that the set of experimental data reflects a law, the 
  specific formulation of a law itself is quite far from being simple and 
  uniform. While in every scientific procedure the same bridging hypothesis is 
  present, this in itself contains no indication of how the particular law has 
  to be spelled out.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Formulating a law is not a mechanical 
  process of stating the evident behavior of the studied quantities. It 
  necessarily involves an interpretive effort on the part of the scientist, who 
  makes choices among various alternative interpretations of the assumed 
  regularity which have to be extracted from arrays of numbers defined within 
  certain margins of error.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the simple case of a functional 
  dependence between two variables, the scientist is confronted with a set of 
  experimental points which seem to display a certain regularity, often rather 
  nebulous because of inevitable experimental errors. Hence, besides the 
  bridging hypothesis which simply postulates the very existence of a law, the 
  scientist must then postulate the specific law itself.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Consider an example. In Coulomb's well 
  known law of interaction between point electric charges, the force of 
  interaction is presented as being inversely proportional to the squared 
  distance between the charges.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The inverse proportionality of the 
  force of electric interaction to the square distance between point charges is, 
  however, not a direct conclusion from the experimental data. One of the 
  reasons for that is the inevitability of errors occurring in every procedure 
  of measurement. If the dependence of Coulomb's force on the distance between 
  the point charges is measured, it is assumed that a) while the distance is 
  being changed, the interacting charges are indeed being kept constant, b) that 
  no other charges which could distort the results are anywhere close to the 
  measuring contraption, c) that the distance itself is measured with sufficient 
  accuracy, etc. All of this is, of course, just an approximation. Let us 
  imagine that in the course of an experiment wherein Coulomb's force was 
  measured, the distance between the supposedly point charges was given the 
  following values (in whatever units of length): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the total of 
  six points at which the above values were determined with an error not 
  exceeding, say, ±5%. This means that when the distance was assumed to be 2, it 
  could actually be anything between 1.9 and about 2.1, and similarly for every 
  other value of the distance. Imagine further that the measured Coulomb's force 
  (in whatever units of force) happened to have the following set of values, 
  averaged over many repeated measurements: 1097, 273.87, 121.64, 68.97, 43.12 
  and 31.01. Repeating the measurement many times, the experimentalist evaluated 
  the margin of error for the force to be ± 10%. Reviewing the set of numbers 
  for the values of the measured force, the researcher notices that these 
  numbers are rather close to a set of numbers obtained by dividing the maximum 
  force of 1097 (measured for the distance of 1) by the squared distances. 
  Indeed, dividing 1097 by the squared values of distances 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, 
  one obtains the following set: 274.25, 121.89, 68.56, 43.88, 30.47. Every 
  number in the experimentally measured set differs from a corresponding number 
  in the second, calculated set, not more than by 10%, which is within the 
  margin of error of that experiment. Although none of the measured numbers 
  exactly equals the numbers calculated upon the assumption that the force drops 
  inversely proportional to the distance, the scientists <i>postulates </i>that 
  the difference between the measured and calculated sets is due to experimental 
  error and that the real law, hidden behind the measured set of numbers, is 
  indeed the inverse proportionality between the force and the <i>squared</i> 
  distance.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is the foundation of that 
  postulate? If instead of the power of 2, the distance in the same formula 
  appeared with the power of, say, 2.008 or 1.9986, such a formula would 
  describe the experimental data as well as Coulomb's law, where the power is 
  exactly 2. Of course, the precision and accuracy of the measurement can be 
  improved so that the margin of error is substantially reduced. However, it can 
  never be reduced to zero. Therefore, the best experimental data cannot provide 
  more than is inherent in them. With a much improved technique we may be able 
  to assert that Coulomb's force changes inversely proportional to the distance 
  to the power being, say, between 1.9999999987 and 2.0000000035, but we can 
  never assert, based just on the experimental data, that the power is exactly 
  2. We have to <i>postulate</i> that the power is exactly 2 rather than any 
  other number between 1.9999999987 and 2.0000000035.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such a postulate is often made on 
  non-scientific grounds. It is often based on some metaphysical consideration, 
  some philosophical principle, or such criteria as simplicity, elegance and the 
  like. We actually have no scientific grounds to prefer the power of 2 to, say, 
  the power of 2.0000986345, since both numbers equally well fit the 
  experimental data. We choose 2 not because the data directly point to that 
  choice but because this choice seems to be either simpler (i.e., using Occam's 
  razor), or more elegant, or more convenient, or maybe just favored by a 
  particular scientist for purely personal reasons.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, the difference between 2 
  and, say, 2.0000897 has no practical consequences, so that we can safely use 
  the formula wherein the exact power of 2 has been postulated, even though we 
  may not be absolutely confident that it is indeed the exactly correct value.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Furthermore, even the principal form 
  of the law  the power function - is not logically predetermined by the data. 
  There are many formulas differing from the simple power function which would 
  yield numbers within the margin of error of the experimental data. For 
  example, it is always possible to construct a polynomial expression whose 
  coefficients are chosen in such a way as to make the numbers calculated by 
  that expression match the measured data within the margin of the experimental 
  error. Hence, not only the value of 2 in the formula of Coulomb's law, but 
  even the form of the law itself is the result of a scientist's assumption. 
  From the above discussion it follows that the laws of science are necessarily 
  postulates. We don't <i>know</i> that the distance in Coulomb's law must be 
  squared, we <i>postulate</i> it.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The choice of a postulate is limited 
  by two considerations. One is the requirement not to contradict experimental 
  data, so we may not arbitrarily assume that the distance in the formula in 
  question must have the power of, say, 2.75, because it is contrary to 
  evidence. The other requirement is not to contradict the overall body of 
  scientific knowledge. Otherwise any number which is within the margin of the 
  experimental error has, in principle, the same right to appear in the formula 
  of law, and the choice of 2 instead of, say, 1.99999867 is a postulate based 
  on metaphysical grounds.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The application of some mathematical 
  apparatus such as, for example, least square fit, does not principally change 
  the situation because the output of the mathematical machine is only as good 
  as is the input.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above discourse may create an 
  impression of arbitrariness of the laws of science. Some philosophers of 
  science think so. Are the laws of science indeed arbitrary?</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They are not.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fault of the above discourse is 
  that it concentrated on the data obtained in a particular experiment as though 
  these data exist in vacuum. In fact, every experiment adds only a very small 
  chunk of new information to the vast arsenal of scientific knowledge and the 
  interpretation of any sets of data must necessarily fit in with the entire 
  wealth of science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If we review the example with 
  Coulomb's law, we will see that actually the choice of both the power function 
  for distance between the interacting point charges and of the exact value of 
  the power as 2, although resulting from a postulate, was not really arbitrary 
  if the results of Coulomb's experiment are viewed from a broader perspective, 
  accounting for information stemming from outside of the experiment itself. 
  Support for the choice of that particular form of Coulomb's law historically 
  came later than Coulomb's law was suggested. Hence Coulomb indeed had to 
  postulate the form of the law without having support from any independent 
  source. However, the chronological order in which different steps of 
  scientific inquiry may occur is of secondary importance, since science 
  develops in leaps and bounds, so that its chronological sequence does not 
  necessarily coincide with a logical sequence. Eventually, though, various 
  components of the scientific insight into reality usually come together thus 
  binding the edifice of science into a strong monolith.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Coulomb's postulate, seemingly based 
  only on the simplicity and elegance of his law, got strong independent support 
  after the concept of the electric field entered science. At that stage of the 
  development of the theory of electricity the force of electric interaction was 
  redefined as the effect of an electric field on an electric charge. Simple 
  geometric consideration shows that the electric field of a lone electric point 
  charge drops inversely proportional to the squared distance from that charge, 
  simply because the area over which the field acts increases proportionally to 
  the squared distance. This conclusion is not the result of a postulate 
  stemming from experimental data but a mathematical certainty. (Of course, the 
  mathematical certainty in itself is based on the postulate of the space being 
  Euclidean).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The convergence of the indisputable 
  geometric facts with Coulomb's experimental data provides an extremely 
  reliable conclusion ascertaining the validity of Coulomb's law in its 
  originally postulated form. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore the notion, often discussed 
  in the philosophy of science, according to which researchers have unlimited 
  flexibility in drawing an infinite number of curves through any number of 
  experimental points (or, more precisely, through the margin of error 
  surrounding each such point), while correct in an abstractly philosophical 
  way, is of little significance for the actual scientific procedure of stating 
  a law. Whereas theoretically one can indeed draw any number of the most fancy 
  curves through any set of points on a graph, in fact a scientist is severely 
  limited in his choice of legitimate curves connecting his experimental points. 
  This limitation is based on at least two factors. One is the requirement that 
  the curve chosen for the particular data set in question must be also 
  compatible with the rest of the data collected in the entire study in 
  question. The other is the requirement that the curve must also be compatible 
  with the enormous wealth of knowledge accumulated in science, including both 
  established theoretical principles and experimental data obtained in different 
  versions of related experiments.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The body of contemporary science is 
  immense. Despite many uncertainties which have not been resolved by science, 
  its achievements are indisputable and ensure the high reliability of science 
  as a whole. Therefore, when facing the choice between various ways to connect 
  experimental points by a continuous curve, the researcher not only matches the 
  particular set of data to other sets of related data, but is also guided by 
  highly reliable theoretical concepts.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To summarize this section, we can 
  state that laws of science are both postulates and approximations. 
  Fortunately, as the great successes of science and the technology based on it 
  prove, those laws which have become firmly accepted as part of science, are, 
  without exception, <i>good</i> postulates and <i>good</i> approximations.

  <a name="models">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">10. Models</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The term <i>model</i> may have various 
  meanings. A <i>model husband</i> is not the same as a <i>model of an airplane.</i> 
  Even in science, that term may be used for rather different concepts. For 
  example, a <i>mathematical model</i> of a phenomenon is a term denoting a set 
  of equations (often differential equations) reflecting the interconnections 
  among various parameters affecting the system's behavior. A <i>computer model
  </i>is a program designed to <i>simulate</i> a certain situation or process.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this section, I will discuss what 
  is sometimes referred to as a <i>physical model.</i> I will refer to it simply 
  as <i>model. </i>To explain the meaning of the term <i>model</i> as it will be 
  used in this section, we first have to state that every model is, in a certain 
  limited sense, always assumed to represent a real object. In this sense, a 
  model is an imaginary object which has a limited number of properties in 
  common with a real object, while the real object represented by the model in 
  question also has many other properties which the model does not possess.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It can be said that at the level of 
  explanation, i.e. on the level of scientific theories, science actually deals 
  only with models rather than with the real objects these models represent. The 
  reason for the replacement of real objects with models is the simple fact that 
  real objects are usually so immensely complex that they cannot be comprehended 
  in all of their complexity by means of a human theoretical analysis. Out of 
  necessity, to build theories science resorts to simplifications in its effort 
  to study and understand the behavior of real systems. To do so science 
  replaces, in the process of a theoretical interpretation of laws, real objects 
  with much simpler representations of the latter which we call models.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are many classical examples of 
  the use of models. Recall again the story of Tycho de Brahe and Kepler. The 
  former had meticulously accumulated numerous data regarding the positions of 
  the planets of the solar system. The latter reviewed these data, postulated 
  that these data reflect a law (i.e. introduced a bridging hypothesis) and 
  further postulated the three specific laws of planetary motion.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The next step in science was to offer 
  a theory explaining Kepler's laws, i.e. to develop a new science  celestial 
  mechanics. This task was brilliantly performed by Newton, who derived 
  theoretical equations explaining Kepler's laws, based on Newton's theory of 
  gravitation and his general laws of mechanics. In doing so, Newton wrote 
  equations in which planets were assumed to be <i>point masses</i>. A <i>point 
  mass</i> is a model of a planet. It shares with the real object it represents 
   a planet  only one property, the planet's mass. Real object  a planet  
  has an enormous number of properties other than its mass. The model of planet 
  in Newton's theory of planetary motion  a point mass  does not have any of 
  those numerous properties the real planets have. Replacing a real object by 
  its substantially simplified model, Newton made it possible to derive a set of 
  elegant equations which provided an excellent approximation of the actual 
  planetary motion.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Recall now another example. There is a 
  branch of applied science called seismometry. It studies the propagation of 
  seismic waves in the crust of the earth. The real object of study in 
  seismometry is the same as in celestial mechanics  the planet. However, 
  obviously, using a point mass as a model would be useless for the purposes of 
  seismometry. The model used in that science is the so-called elastic 
  half-space. In that model, only three properties are common with the real 
  object  the modulus of elasticity, Poisson's coefficient and the sheer 
  modulus. The mass of the planet which is the property of the model of earth in 
  celestial mechanics, is absent in the model of the same earth in seismometry, 
  whereas the moduli and coefficients of the seismometric model are absent in 
  the model of the same earth in celestial mechanics. The two models of the same 
  real object are vastly different in the two mentioned branches of science to 
  such an extent that it is hard to find anything in common between the two 
  models, both representing the same object, but with different theoretical 
  goals.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Both models are highly successful. 
  Choosing these models enabled scientists to successfully build good theories, 
  in one case of planetary motion, and in the other, of the propagation of 
  mechanical waves in the crust of a planet.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How is a model chosen? There is no 
  known prescription for choosing a good model. The choice is to be made of 
  those properties of the real object which are of primary importance for the 
  studied behavior of the system in question, while all other properties of the 
  real object are deemed to be of negligible significance and therefore not 
  attributed to the model. There are no known specific criteria telling the 
  scientist how to distinguish between those properties of the real object which 
  are crucial for the problem at hand and those which are insignificant for that 
  particular theory. The scientist must make the choice based on his intuition, 
  on his experience, and on his imagination. If the model has been chosen 
  successfully, this paves the way to developing a good theory of the 
  phenomenon. If some crucial properties of the real object are ignored in the 
  model, the latter would lead to a defective theory. If some insignificant 
  properties of the real object are attributed to the model, its theoretical 
  treatment may turn out to be too unwieldy and the ensuing theory too awkward 
  for its acceptance in science. The proper choice of a model, which sometimes 
  is made subconsciously, is an extremely important step in a scientific 
  endeavor. This is the step where the deviation from good to bad science occurs 
  most often.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us now review an example of a bad 
  model. A posting at <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/behe2.cfm">
  Irreducible Contradiction</a> contains a detailed critical review of a book 
  titled &quot;Darwin's Black Box&quot; by Michael Behe. In that review, many faults of 
  Behe's concept of the so-called &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; of micro molecular 
  systems have been criticized. Now we will look at Behe's concept from the 
  viewpoint of his choice of a model. A favorite example of &quot;irreducible 
  complexity,&quot; used by Behe in several of his publications, is a mousetrap. This 
  device, which, unlike a biological cell, is quite simple, consists of five 
  parts, each of them, says Behe, necessary for the proper functioning of the 
  mousetrap. If any of these parts were absent, says Behe, the mousetrap would 
  not work. Removing any single part of the mousetrap, Behe tells us, would 
  render it useless. Therefore it must have been designed in a one-step process, 
  as a whole rather than having been developed in stages from simpler versions. 
  Behe asserts that a similar situation exists in biological cells, which 
  contain a very large number of proteins all working together so that the 
  removal of even a single protein would render the cell incapable of performing 
  a certain function necessary for the organism's well being. Since all proteins 
  are necessary for the proper functioning of a cell, argues Behe, the cell 
  could not evolve from some simpler structures because such simpler structures 
  would be useless and hence could not be steps of evolution.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is clear that Behe uses a mousetrap 
  as a model of a cell. This is an amazing example of how bad a model may happen 
  to be.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Assume first that Behe is correct in 
  stating that removing any part of the mousetrap would render it dysfunctional. 
  Even with this assumption, the fundamental fault of that model is in that it 
  ignores some crucial properties of cells and therefore is inadequate for the 
  discussion in question. The first fault of Behe's model is in that his model 
  (the mousetrap) unlike a cell, cannot replicate. The mousetrap (like Paley's 
  watch) has no ancestors and will have no descendants. Therefore the mousetrap 
  certainly could not evolve from a more primitive ancestor. The biological 
  systems replicate and therefore are capable of evolving via descent with 
  modification. The second fault of Behe's model is in that it ignores the 
  redundancy of biological structures. For example, the DNA molecule contains 
  many copies of identical formations some of which serve as genes and can 
  continue to perform a certain useful function while their copies are free to 
  undergo mutations and thus lead to new functions. The mousetrap lacks such 
  redundancy and therefore it is a bad model which does not at all illustrate 
  the alleged irreducible complexity of microbiological structures.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The situation with the mousetrap as an 
  alleged model of irreducible complexity is actually much worse. In fact, 
  Behe's five-part mousetrap is not irreducibly complex at all. Out of its five 
  parts, four can be removed one by one and the remaining four-part, then 
  three-part, then two-part, and finally a one-part contraptions would still be 
  usable for catching mice. Anybody with an engineering experience can see that. 
  Alternatively, the five-part mousetrap in Behe's model can be built up step by 
  step from a one-part contraption, making it gradually two-part, three-part, 
  four-part, and finally five-part contraptions, each of them capable of 
  performing the job of catching mice, this capability slightly improving with 
  each added part. (Nice versions of simpler mousetraps with one, two, three, 
  and four parts were demonstrated by Dr. John McDonald at
  <a href="http://udel.edu/~mcdonald/mousetrap.html">A reducibly complex 
  mousetrap</a>.)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If the mousetrap were capable of 
  reproduction, it certainly could have evolved from a primitive but still 
  usable one-part device via descent with modification governed by natural 
  selection. Hence, the model chosen by Behe not only does not support his 
  thesis but actually can serve to argue against the latter.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Behe's supporters often refer to his 
  mousetrap example as a good illustration of the irreducible complexity, 
  obviously not noticing the fallacy of this bad model.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his book, Behe claims that his 
  thesis of irreducible complexity is on a par with the greatest achievements of 
  science such as those by Newton, Einstein, Lavoisier, Schroedinger, Pasteur, 
  and Darwin (page 233 in his book). This claim, besides being a display of 
  self-aggrandizing exaggeration, runs contrary to Behe's suggestion of what can 
  be perhaps referred to as an anti-model.</font></p>
  <a name="cognitive">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">11. Cognitive hypotheses</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The choice of a cognitive hypothesis 
  is closely related to the choice of a model. Sometimes these two steps merge 
  into one. In other cases, though, the choice of a model is a step separate 
  from the choice of a cognitive hypothesis. Whatever the case, a hypothesis 
  cannot be defined unless a definite model of the phenomenon in question, 
  consciously or subconsciously, has been selected, either in advance or 
  simultaneous with the hypothesis.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A cognitive hypothesis is the 
  necessary first step toward developing a theory which would strive to explain 
  a phenomenon. A law postulated on the basis of experimental data is always of 
  the phenomenological character. It describes the regularity which has been 
  assumed to govern the observed data, without explaining the mechanism of the 
  process which results in those data. A theory of a phenomenon, on the other 
  hand, has to be of explanatory nature, i.e. it must suggest a logically 
  consistent and plausible explanation of the mechanism in question. In order to 
  develop a theory, a cognitive hypothesis must be first chosen. The cognitive 
  hypothesis is a basic idea serving as a foundation for the theory's 
  development.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Choosing a cognitive hypothesis is 
  often a subconscious procedure, based essentially on the scientist's 
  imagination. Very often scientists who have come up with a cognitive 
  hypothesis cannot themselves explain how that hypothesis emerged in their 
  minds. Experience certainly may play a significant role in a scientist's 
  ability to come up with a hypothesis which would provide a basis for the 
  development of theory. There are known, however, many cases when a young 
  scientist with little or no experience suggested ideas which escaped the minds 
  of much more experienced colleagues. One of the most famous examples is 
  Einstein's theory of photoelectric effect, for which he was awarded the Nobel 
  prize. Einstein was only 26 at that time and had no record of preceding 
  scientific achievements. The photoelectric effect, which was discovered by 
  Heinrich Hertz more than 25 years earlier, has a number of puzzling features 
  and none of the leading experienced scientists could offer any reasonable 
  explanation of those features. In a brief article Einstein offered a brilliant 
  interpretation of the data obtained in the experiments, which immediately 
  solved the puzzle in a consistent and transparent way. The cognitive 
  hypothesis offered by Einstein maintained that electromagnetic energy is 
  emitted, propagates, and is absorbed by solids in discrete portions (later 
  named photons). Based on that hypothesis, Einstein developed a consistent and 
  highly logical theory which solved the puzzle of the photoelectric effect in a 
  very plausible way.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many scientists who have suggested 
  various hypotheses, often assert that they cannot explain how that hypothesis 
  formed in their mind. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I take the liberty of giving an 
  example from my own experience. Many years ago, I studied internal stress in 
  metallic films. At an early stage of that study I had already found that in 
  the process of film growth two types of stress, tensile and compressive, 
  emerge simultaneously, each apparently due to a different type of a mechanism. 
  Reviewing the multitude of experimental data, I tried very hard to imagine 
  what the mechanisms for the emergence of each of the two types of stress could 
  be. I will refer now only to the hypothesis I offered for tensile stress 
  (although I also offered another hypothesis for compressive stress). I cannot 
  give any explanation of why and how I came up with the hypothesis according to 
  which tensile stress in growing films appeared because of the egress of a 
  certain type of crystalline defects, the so-called dislocations, to the 
  surface of the crystallites. At that time, the very existence of dislocations 
  was disputed by some scientists (although a well developed theoretical model 
  of dislocations had already been developed). One day, without a consciously 
  realized reason, a vivid picture of dislocations moving away from each other 
  until they reach the surface of crystallites emerged in my mind as if 
  projected on a screen and I had a feeling that I could somehow see the 
  microscopic world of crystals.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The model I had in mind was a crystal 
  containing a certain concentration of dislocations, whereas the existence of 
  all other types of defects, always present in real crystals, was ignored. The 
  vision of the dislocations' egress as a source of tensile stress in films 
  originated purely in my imagination. On the basis of that vision I set out to 
  derive formulas which would enable me to calculate stress originating from the 
  dislocations' egress, i.e., I proceeded from the cognitive hypothesis to a 
  theory. Years later, when improved methods of electron microscopy were 
  developed, not only were dislocations directly observed, thus vindicating the 
  dislocation theory itself, but also, a little later, the very egress of 
  dislocations, which I hypothesized earlier as a source of tensile stress, was 
  observed experimentally, thus justifying the hypothesis which originally was 
  born simply out of my imagination.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although my theory of tensile stress 
  in films was, of course, only a very small contribution to science, I believe 
  that the process is similar also in the cases of much more important 
  scientific theories.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Quite often more than one hypothesis 
  can be offered for the same data, i.e. different models of the same object or 
  phenomenon can compete with each other. The competition between hypotheses 
  extends into a competition between the theories developed on the basis of 
  those hypotheses. We will discuss theories in the next section. </font></p>
  <a name="theories">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">12. Theories</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although the development of science is 
  a very complex process, which occurs via many different ways and in various 
  manners, so that no simple straightforward scheme can describe it, it is more 
  or less common situation wherein the following steps are present in the 
  development of a particular chunk of science: accumulation of data, adopting a 
  bridging hypothesis (either directly or as a result of the procedure of 
  statistical hypotheses testing), formulating a law, choosing a model, 
  suggesting a cognitive hypothesis, and, finally, developing a theory, although 
  these steps may partially merge, be taken subconsciously and occur not in the 
  above chronological order.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although these steps often appear not 
  in a clearly distinctive form, they are commonly present and each of them 
  requires specific qualities from a scientist to be successful. For example, an 
  accomplished experimentalist may happen to be a poor theoretician, and vise 
  versa.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Offering a cognitive hypothesis 
  requires <i>imagination</i>, and different scientists may possess it to a 
  different degree. Development of a theory, on the other hand, requires the 
  pertinent <i>skill</i> and is facilitated by experience.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a distinction between 
  particular theories designed to explain the results of a specific experiment, 
  and theories of a general character, embracing a whole branch of science. 
  Theories of the first type are often suggested by the same researchers who 
  have conducted the experiment. Theories of the second type usually are 
  developed by theoreticians who rarely or never conduct any experiments. This 
  division of tasks between participants of the scientific process is necessary 
  because, first, modern science has reached a very high level of complexity and 
  sophistication, thus necessitating a specialization of scientists in narrow 
  fields, and second, because each of the steps of scientific inquiry requires a 
  different type of talent and skill.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A scientific theory is an explanation 
  of a phenomenon, which is systematic, plausible, and compatible with the 
  entirety of the experimental or observational evidence.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Einstein said, data remain while 
  theories change with time. Each theory is only as good as the body of data it 
  is compatible with. If new data are discovered, it may require reconsideration 
  of a theory or even its complete replacement with another theory. Therefore it 
  is often said that every theory only can make one of two statements: either 
  &quot;No,&quot; or &quot;Maybe,&quot; but never an unequivocal &quot;Yes.&quot; In other words, it is often 
  said that all scientific theories are tentative because there is always the 
  possibility that new facts will be discovered which would disprove the theory.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While the above assertion certainly 
  contains much truth, I believe that it requires amendment. Reviewing the 
  theories which are accepted in science, it is easy to see that there are two 
  types of the theories. Most of the theories are indeed only tentative, 
  because, as is often stated, the experimental or observational data 
  &quot;underdetermine&quot; the theory. However, there are certain theories whose 
  reliability is so firmly established that the chance of them being ever 
  disproved is negligible.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An example of such a theory is 
  Mendeleev's periodic system of elements. There is hardly a chance it will ever 
  be disproved. This statement relates not only to the phenomenological form of 
  the periodic system as was suggested by Mendeleev, but also to the explanatory 
  theory of the periodic system of elements, based on quantum-mechanical 
  concepts.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this respect, it seems appropriate 
  to discuss the idea of the so-called paradigms which was suggested by Kuhn. 
  There is a vast literature wherein Kuhn's ideas are discussed. According to 
  Kuhn's idea, science develops within the framework of a system of commonly 
  accepted concepts, which he called the paradigm. As long as a certain paradigm 
  is in power, theories are accepted by the scientific community only if they 
  fall within the framework of the reigning paradigm. If some data seem to 
  contradict the reigning paradigm, they are either ignored or downplayed. 
  According to the extreme form of that view, the truth is irrelevant in 
  science, which only is looking for ways to conform to the reigning paradigm.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the data contradicting the 
  reigning paradigm accumulate, at some moment the reigning paradigm can no 
  longer withstand the pressure of the contradicting evidence and collapses, 
  being replaced by another paradigm, and this is referred to as a revolution in 
  science. According to Kuhn's view, a new paradigm can completely eradicate the 
  system of concepts which characterized the preceding paradigm, and each 
  paradigm is a product of human imagination having little to do with the search 
  for truth.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe that Kuhn's scheme does not 
  really reflect the nature of scientific revolutions. Reviewing the history of 
  science shows that Kuhn's scheme is of purely philosophical origin with little 
  foundation in facts. As the history of science teaches us, a revolution in 
  science normally does not eradicate the preceding set of adopted concepts in 
  science but rather reveals the limits of its validity. In that, the scientific 
  revolution not only does not abolish the preceding &quot;paradigm,&quot; but, on the 
  contrary, provides stronger support for it by clarifying the boundaries of its 
  applicability.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is hard to indicate a revolution in 
  science which would be more dramatic than the revolution in physics which 
  occurred at the beginning of the 20th century. The emergence of the theory of 
  relativity and of quantum mechanics shattered the science of physics to its 
  very core and seemed to drastically reform the entire set of concepts on which 
  physics seemed so firmly established. However, even that monumental scientific 
  revolution did not in the least abolish the constituents of pre-Einstein and 
  pre-Planck physics. Newton's mechanics, Faraday-Maxwell's theory of 
  electromagnetism, Clausius  Nernst's thermodynamics, Bolznmann  Gibbs's 
  statistical physics, and many other fundamental insights into reality of the 
  pre-20th century physics remained intact as parts of science believed to 
  deeply reflect the features of the real world, whereas the boundaries of their 
  applicability became much better understood.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, many scientific theories 
  did not stand up to the subsequent scrutiny and collapsed under the weight of 
  new evidence. The theories of caloric fluid and of phlogiston in physics, the 
  theory of vitalism in biology, and many less-known theories died either 
  quietly or after a desperate fight for survival. However, this normal process 
  of a natural selection of scientific theories had little in common with the 
  picture of Kuhn's paradigms, encompassing the entire set of conceptions and 
  reigning over the scientific endeavors, and allegedly periodically replacing 
  one another in revolutions which eradicate the preceding paradigms in their 
  entirety. Kuhn's idea, in its ultimate form denying that science is about 
  truth, is fortunately not supported by evidence. With all of its shortcomings, 
  and with indeed the largely tentative nature of scientific laws and theories, 
  there is no other area of the human endeavor as successful as science. Its 
  achievements are amazing and indisputable.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another point that seems related to 
  the above discussion is the assertion by the philosopher of science Karl 
  Popper that a necessary feature of genuine science is its being falsifiable. 
  Popper's ideas have been discussed in numerous publications and have even been 
  incorporated into decisions by courts regarding the definition of science. If 
  a theory is not falsifiable, says Popper, it is not genuinely scientific. 
  Another way to say this is to assert that every scientific theory must be &quot;at 
  risk&quot; of being disproved. Without delving into a detailed discussion of 
  Popper's idea, I must say that I am uncertain about its validity. I don't 
  think the periodic system of elements is at risk of being disproved but it 
  certainly is a legitimate part of science. On the other hand, there are plenty 
  of easily falsifiable theories which are pseudo-scientific. Therefore I have 
  some doubts regarding the versatility of Popper's criterion. I will not 
  discuss this question further. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Scientific inquiry continues 
  unabatedly, with the ever increasing rate of unearthing new knowledge of the 
  real world. Probably the most visible results of the progress of science are 
  its offspring  technology and medicine. Let us talk a little about the 
  relationship between science and technology.</font></p>
  <a name="tech">
  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">13. Science and technology</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The amazing progress of various modern 
  technologies is commonly attributed to input from science. Whereas this 
  attribution is indeed well justified, the relation between science and 
  technology is not unidirectional. Historically, whereas many innovations in 
  technology resulted from direct applications of scientific discoveries, some 
  branches of science themselves received a strong impetus from technical 
  inventions which sometimes were products of an inventor's intuition. Before 
  illustrating the above processes of the mutual fertilization of science and 
  technology, it seems proper to note that even in those cases when an important 
  invention was made without an apparent direct connection to a specific 
  scientific discovery or theory, nevertheless the inventor certainly has the 
  advantage of standing on a firm foundation of the entire body of contemporary 
  science. Therefore it can be confidently said that the progress of technology, 
  directly or indirectly, has been ensured by the progress of science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A good example of the emergence of a 
  new technology as a direct result of the progress of science is the explosive 
  use of semiconductors which started in the late 1940s. Until the middle 
  thirties the very term <i>semiconductor</i> was almost completely absent in 
  the scientific literature. The solid materials were usually divided into only 
  two classes  conductors and dielectrics. The materials which eventually were 
  classified as the third separate type of solids, named semiconductors, had 
  been viewed simply either as bad conductors or as bad dielectrics. In the 
  thirties, the quantum-mechanical theory of conductivity was developed (the 
  so-called energy bands theory) which identified three distinctive classes of 
  solids from the standpoint of the behavior of their electrons. This theory 
  predicted the peculiar features of the behavior of semiconductors, as a 
  separate class distinct from conductors and dielectrics.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Semiconductor technology was 
  practically non-existent at that time, although some rather primitive devices 
  were already in use, like electric current rectifiers in which the 
  semiconductor <i>copper sulfide</i> was utilized. The important step in 
  science  the explanation of the mechanism of electric conductivity  at once 
  laid the foundation for an immediate development of various semiconductor 
  devices. It did not happened, though. It seems that whereas science in the 
  thirties had prepared conditions for a revolution in technology, the latter 
  simply was not yet prepared for digesting the scientific discovery. It took 
  about fifteen years before the semiconductor technology for which the 
  scientific basis already existed started taking off. Since then, however, the 
  development of semiconductor technology directly stemming from the progress of 
  physics of semiconductors has been proceeding at an amazing, ever increasing 
  rate, resulting in a real revolution in communication, automation and many 
  other fields of engineering and technology.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An example of the opposite sequence of 
  the science-technology interaction is the story of the Swedish engineer Carl 
  Gustaf Patrik de Laval (1846-1913), the inventor of the steam turbine. In the 
  process of designing his famous turbine, Laval encountered many difficult 
  problems. Laval possessed an inordinate engineering intuition and 
  inventiveness. Among several highly impressive inventions Laval made on his 
  way to building a workable high-speed turbine, two stand alone as amazing 
  insights into phenomena which had not yet been studied and understood by 
  science at that time. One such invention was of the so-called Laval's flexible 
  shaft, and the other, of Laval's nozzle.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Laval's turbine was designed to rotate 
  at a very high speed. The turbine's wheel sits on a rapidly rotating shaft. At 
  certain values of the shaft's rotational speed, which are referred to as 
  critical speeds, a phenomenon called resonance occurs when the shaft 
  experiences sharply increasing bending forces. This may easily cause the 
  breakdown of the shaft. According to common sense, it seems reasonable to 
  increase the shaft's strength by increasing its diameter. However, increasing 
  the shaft's diameter also causes the increase of the bending force at the 
  critical speed of rotation. It seemed to be a vicious circle. Laval, instead 
  of increasing the shaft's diameter, made his shafts very thin, and hence very 
  flexible. Amazingly, instead of making the thin rapidly rotating shafts 
  weaker, the decrease of their diameters led to a peculiar phenomenon, not 
  foreseen by the science of mechanics of rotating bodies. As the speed of 
  rotation reached the critical value, the bending force reversed its direction, 
  straightening the shaft instead of bending it. Nobody knows why and how the 
  idea of a flexible shaft occurred to Laval. The scientific explanation of the 
  behavior of the flexible shafts at critical speeds was developed years after 
  Laval's turbine was introduced, becoming a separate chapter in the branch of 
  science called technical dynamics. Laval's insight provided a strong impetus 
  for the development of that science, which, in turn, later provided powerful 
  inputs into various technologies.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Laval's invention of a flexible shaft 
  was by no means exceptional for that great inventor. His genius and intuition 
  were equally amazing in his invention of Laval's nozzle. Without going into 
  the details of that extraordinary invention, let us simply state that the 
  subsequent development of a theory explaining the behavior of Laval's nozzle, 
  gave a mighty push to the emergence of a new scientific field  gas dynamics 
  which in turn has become a foundation of important modern technologies.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While paying proper tribute to Laval's 
  genius and recognizing that his amazing insights were not based on any 
  specific scientific discoveries of his time, we must also realize that Laval, 
  however inventive and inordinately talented he was, could not have made his 
  inventions if he lived, say, a hundred years earlier. Whereas he did not 
  derive the ideas of the flexible shaft and a novel type of a nozzle from any 
  specific scientific discovery or theory, his entire mental makeup and the way 
  of thinking were formed as products of his time, with its already high level 
  of scientific knowledge in physics, chemistry and many other disciplines.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One more feature of the interaction 
  between science and technology is that it often becomes hard to distinguish 
  where science ends and technology development starts. This convergence of 
  scientific research and the development of new technologies is often referred 
  to by a not precisely defined term of applied science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whereas the goal of pure (or <i>basic</i>) 
  science is viewed as a search for truth, regardless of if and how the 
  unearthed secrets of the nature can be utilized towards a gain in man's well 
  being, the goal of applied science is viewed as a search for better 
  technologies or for advances in medicine or pharmacology.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Research divisions of large hi-tech 
  and pharmaceutical companies as well as university departments financed by 
  industry are engaged in intensive studies wherein the distinction between pure 
  and applied science is sometimes hard to see.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For example, the two foremost research 
  institutions  Bell Labs and the IBM research division  have recently 
  announced the independent successful development of new types of non-silicon 
  based transistors of molecular-size dimensions. This impressive breakthrough 
  in nanotechnology was certainly made possible only because in both 
  institutions research was not limited to the narrow task of technological 
  advance but involved intensive research of the type traditionally considered a 
  part of pure science. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am again taking the liberty of 
  referring to an example from my own experience (of course, much more modest 
  than the examples discussed so far). In 1973 I had a student working toward a 
  MSc degree who studied the effect of illumination on the adsorption behavior 
  of semiconductor surfaces. When I was preparing instructions for that student, 
  I had a hunch that the effect of the so-called photo-adsorption, known to 
  exist on solid semi-conductor surfaces, must exist as well for small 
  semiconductor particles if the latter were suspended in water. Together with a 
  chemist who worked in my lab, we prepared a colloid solution containing small 
  spherical particles of semiconductor Selenium. I placed a transparent 
  plexiglas plate on the solutions surface, ran to the buildings roof and 
  exposed the solution to the rays of sun. To my excitement, a smooth film of 
  amorphous Selenium grew rapidly on the plexiglas plate right in front of my 
  eyes, thus confirming my hunch that high energy photons must lower the 
  potential barrier for electrons on suspended semiconductor particles. Soon a 
  few students joined the project. Besides the theory I developed for what was 
  labeled inverse photo-adsorption, the project also resulted in a technology 
  for photodeposition of semiconductor films. (For details of that work see, for 
  example Mark Perakh, Aaron Peled and Zeev Feit. Photodeposition of Amorphous 
  Selenium Films by the Selor Process. 1. Main Features of the Process; Films

  question of whether or not the attribution of a phenomenon to a supernatural 
  source may be legitimate in science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This question is separate from the 
  problem of the relationship between science and religion. The latter problem 
  is multi-faceted and includes a number of questions such as the compatibility 
  of scientific data with religious dogma (in particular with the biblical story 
  of creation), the roles of science and religions for the society as a whole 
  and for individuals, the impact of the science and religions on the moral 
  fiber of the society, and many other aspects, each deserving a detailed 
  consideration. In this section, however, my topic is much narrower, and 
  relates only to the question of whether or not science may legitimately 
  consider possible supernatural explanations of the laws of nature and of 
  specific events.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obviously, the answer to that question 
  depends on the definition of science. If science is defined as being limited 
  only to &quot;natural&quot; phenomena, then obviously anything which is supernatural is 
  beyond scientific discourse. Such definitions of science have been suggested 
  and even produced as outcomes of legal procedures.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While I understand the reasons for the 
  limitations of legitimate subjects for scientific exploration only to &quot;natural 
  causes&quot; and, moreover, emotionally am sympathetic to them, I think there is no 
  real need to apply such limitations, and a definition of science should not 
  put any limits whatsoever on legitimate subjects for the scientific 
  exploration of the world. My opinion is based on the simple fact: although 
  science, which has so far not used anything which could be attributed to a 
  supernatural cause, and in doing so has achieved staggering successes, there 
  still remain unanswered many fundamental questions about nature. Possibly such 
  answers will be found some day, if science proceeds on the path of only 
  &quot;natural&quot; explanations. Until such answers are found, nothing should be 
  prohibited as a legitimate subject of science, and excluding the supernatural 
  out of hand serves no useful purpose.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Moreover, it does not seem a simple 
  task to offer a satisfactory definition of the difference between &quot;natural&quot; 
  and &quot;supernatural.&quot; A phenomenon which seems to be contrary to known theories 
  and therefore appears to be a miracle, and, hence, to meet the concept of the 
  supernatural, may find a &quot;natural&quot; explanation in the course of a subsequent 
  research. The distinction between natural and supernatural belongs more to 
  philosophy than to science.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A point which seems to be relevant for 
  the discussion at hand is about the distinction between rational and 
  irrational approaches to problems. It seems a platitude that to be 
  legitimately scientific, a discourse must necessarily be rational, whereas 
  religious faith does not need to be based on a rational foundation. If this is 
  so, it seems necessary to first define what makes a discourse rational.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For the purpose of this discussion, I 
  will suggest the following definition of a rational attitude to controversial 
  issues. In order to be viewed as rational, the attitude must meet the 
  following requirements: 1) It must clearly distinguish between facts and the 
  interpretation of facts. 2) It must clearly distinguish between a) undeniable 
  facts proven by uncontroversial direct evidence, b) plausible but unproven 
  notions, c) notions agreed upon for the sake of discussion, d) notions that 
  are possible but not supported by evidence, and e) notions contradicting 
  evidence.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If we adopt the premise that the 
  listed situations must be clearly distinguished in a rational discourse, we 
  must also accept that a rational <i>conclusion </i>is such that is based 
  solely on <i>facts</i> proven by uncontroversial direct evidence. Statements 
  and notions arrived at without meeting the above criteria I will view as 
  irrational, regardless of how many adherents they may have. A conclusion or 
  view can be accepted as rational only if it is based on a careful analysis of 
  the matter with regards to its meeting the above points.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Note that my definition does not 
  contain any criteria designed to assert that a notion, conclusion, or view in 
  question is <i>true.</i> In other words, my definition of <i>rational</i> does 
  not necessarily coincide with a definition of what is <i>true.</i></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If science is defined simply as a 
  human endeavor aimed at acquiring knowledge about the world in a systematic 
  and logically consistent way, based on <i>factual evidence</i> obtained by 
  observation and experimentation, then there is no need to exclude anything 
  from the scope of scientific exploration simply because it does not belong in 
  science <i>by definition</i>.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, removing the prohibitions 
  which limit the legitimate boundaries of science to whatever can be defined as 
  &quot;natural,&quot; does not mean that in science anything goes. To be a proper part of 
  science, the process of developing an explanation of phenomena must 
  necessarily be rationally based on factual evidence, i.e. on reliable data.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So far, no attribution of any events 
  to a supernatural source have ever been based on factual evidence.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To clarify my thesis by example, let 
  us return to the discussion of the so-called Bible code, mentioned in one of 
  the preceding sections. Recall that in a paper by the three Israeli authors, 
  published in 1994 in the <i>Statistical Science</i> journal, a claim was made, 
  based on a statistical study of the text of the book of Genesis, that within 
  that text there exists a complex &quot;code&quot; predicting the names, and dates of 
  births and deaths of many famous rabbis who lived thousand years after the 
  text in question was written. The three authors used certain moderately 
  sophisticated methods of statistical analysis of texts in order to prove their 
  claim.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obviously, if the claim of the three 
  authors were true, it would mean that the author of the book of Genesis knew 
  about the events which would occur thousand years after he was compiling the 
  text in question. This would constitute a miracle and hence must have a 
  supernatural explanation (although at least one writer suggested that the 
  alleged code was inserted into the text of the Bible by visitors from other 
  planets). Despite the obvious religious implications of the claim made by the 
  three authors, the editorial board of the journal, which comprised 22 members, 
  approved the publication of the article by the three Israelis. This was a 
  convincing display of scientists keeping open mind, contrary to the persistent 
  assertions by the adherents of the &quot;intelligent design,&quot; such as Phillip 
  Johnson, accusing scientists in having &quot;closed minds.&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There was nothing non-scientific in 
  the three Israelis' approach itself, hence their claim became a legitimate 
  subject of normal scientific discussion, despite the obvious implications of a 
  supernatural origin of the text in question.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If the claim by the three Israelis 
  were confirmed and hence accepted by the scientific community as a result of 
  properly collected data and of their proper analysis, their results would have 
  become part of science, despite their religious implications. Moreover, the 
  proof of the existence of a real code in the Bible would constitute a strong 
  scientific argument for the divine origin of the Bible and hence support the 
  foundation of the Jewish and Christian religions. This is a way the 
  supernatural may legitimately enter the realm of science. It requires reliable 
  factual evidence.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Bible code, however, rather 
  swiftly was shown to be far from being proven. It was convincingly shown that 
  the claim of the three Israelis was based on bad data. Moreover, a number of 
  serious faults were identified in the statistical procedure used by the three 
  Israelis. Hence the story of the alleged Bible code, rejected by the 
  scientific community, did not change the fact that so far no miracles have 
  ever been proven by scientific methods.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, although in my view the 
  reference to a supernatural source of the events should not be excluded from 
  science out of hand - simply by definition, - accepting the claim of a miracle 
  into science can only take place if it is based on reliable evidence, meeting 
  the requirements of scientific rigor.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If the past is any indication of the 
  future, science has nothing to be afraid of in not excluding supernatural 
  explanations if the latter are required to compete with the natural 
  explanations on equal terms. The chance that a certain actually observed 
  phenomenon will be successfully attributed to a supernatural source in a 
  scientifically rigorous way is very slim indeed. </font></p>

  <h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">15. Conclusion</font></h2>
  </a>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the late forties, a meeting of 
  biologists took place at the Academy of Agricultural Science in Moscow where 
  the scientists who objected to Lysenko's pseudo-science were verbally abused, 
  derided, and insulted, as a prelude to their subsequent dismissal from all 
  universities and research institutions, arrests, and imprisonment. Officially 
  the meeting was supposed to be devoted to a scientific discussion of the 
  problems of modern biology and agriculture. However, at the last session of 
  that meeting, Lysenko's speech included the lines &quot;The question is asked in 
  one of the notes handed to me, 'what is the attitude of the Central Committee 
  of the Communist Party to my report?' I answer: the Central Committee of the 
  Party examined my report and approved it.&quot; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Everybody in the audience stood up and 
  lengthy applause followed.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, we see that sometimes truth in 
  science was decreed by the ruler of a country. Is this a normal process of 
  establishing the validity of a scientific theory?</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course this was an example of a 
  pathological usurpation of the power of science by dictatorial rulers of a 
  totalitarian state.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How, then, is the validity of a 
  scientific theory established? There is no central committee which is 
  empowered to decide which theory is correct.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, there are numerous 
  organizations, such as the Royal Society of London, academies of science in 
  various countries, scientific societies, both national and international, 
  which award prizes and honorary fellowships for achievements in science thus 
  bestowing an imprimatur of approval on certain theories and discoveries, but 
  these official or semi-official signs of recognition serve more as tributes to 
  human vanity than as real proofs of the validity of scientific theories. The 
  most prestigious of all these prizes is perhaps the Nobel prize, awarded by 
  the Swedish Academy of Science. Whereas the majority of the Nobel prize 
  winners are indeed outstanding contributors to science, even this enormously 
  prestigious prize could in certain cases invoke the following line from a very 
  popular in Russia play by Aleksandr Griboedov titled <i>The Grief because of 
  Wisdom</i>: &quot;Ranks are given by men and men are prone to err.&quot; Of course, the 
  fact that many brilliant scientists whose contributions to science were among 
  the most important in the 20th century have never been awarded the Nobel prize 
  is understandable. The number of Nobel prizes is very limited and the Swedish 
  Academy has to make hard choices. However, even among the Nobel laureates in 
  physics there are certain personalities who were simply lucky enough to come 
  across an important discovery by sheer chance, some of them even not capable 
  of realizing what was the meaning of the observed effect. The names of some of 
  these prize winners are an open secret in the scientific community.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore prizes and fellowships, 
  however prestigious, are not a legitimate means for establishing the validity 
  and importance of this or that theory.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is, then, the validity of a theory 
  established by a vote of scientists, so that the choice between theories is 
  made based on the majority of votes?</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However ridiculous this picture may 
  seem, and despite the indisputable fact that often a single scientist may turn 
  out to be right even if all the rest of scientists think otherwise, actually 
  the acceptance of theories is indeed determined by an unwritten consensus 
  among scientists. Such a consensus is usually not formed by a vote at a single 
  meeting of the experts in a given field but is, rather, achieved in a 
  haphazard way through a piecemeal exchange of information among the 
  specialists in that field. Sometimes it happens swiftly, when scientists 
  working in a given area of research overwhelmingly come to believe in a theory 
  because of its strong explanatory power and solid foundation in data. An 
  example of such a theory is the theory of quarks suggested by Murray 
  Gell-Mann. In some other cases a theory may wait for a prolonged time before 
  becoming generally accepted. An example of such situation is the theory of 
  dislocations. Suggested in the early twenties (first as a hypothesis) 
  independently by three scientists (in England, Russia, and Japan) and rather 
  soon developed as a mathematically sophisticated branch of physics of 
  crystals, it had indisputable explanatory power and elucidated in a very 
  logical way many effects which seemed puzzling at that time. Nevertheless, for 
  many years it could not win universal acceptance because the very existence of 
  dislocations assumed by the theory was not experimentally proven. Only with 
  drastic improvements in electron microscopy, were the dislocations 
  experimentally observed and thus the theory vindicated and universally 
  accepted.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In that sense, it can be said that 
  scientific theories gain the imprimatur of approval through a vote by 
  scientists. They fall by the same procedure. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This means that science is largely 
  immune to attacks by amateurs and pseudo-scientists, regardless of whether 
  they try to undermine science under the banner of an undisguised creationism, 
  or masquerading as legitimate alternatives to the mainstream science, as 
  &quot;intelligent design&quot; proponents are doing nowadays. I believe that their 
  attack is doomed to fail, although they can be expected to continue generating 
  annoying noise thus distracting scientists from a fruitful research. In 
  particular, the frequent claims by the neo-creationists like Johnson or 
  Dembski that Darwinism is a dying theory, to be imminently replaced by the 
  &quot;Intelligent Design,&quot; are too obviously only displays of what they wish to be 
  the case rather than the actual situation. Darwinism is part of science and 
  science is robust enough to withstand the attack by pseudo-scientists of the 
  kind represented by Dembski, Johnson and their cohorts. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One thing however, seems quite 
  certain. Whatever the definition of science may be, and despite the misuse of 
  its achievements by all kinds of miscreants, and despite its multiple 
  shortcomings and failures, it is probably the most magnificent of the human 
  endeavors.</font></p>
