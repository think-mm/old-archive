    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Artistic appreciation for many seem 
    to be a result of extrinsic factors, like influences, popularity, constant 
    exposure to a widely available and plugged art form,, an urge to go with the 
    going fad or style, cultural bias among many others. For few is it due to a 
    genuine desire to discover and appreciate the intrinsic quality of the art, 
    e.g by listening or reading all genre of music or literature and selecting 
    discriminately. Some do have a strong individual sense of like and dislike 
    which they use as a guide in selecting art of their choice for their own 
    pleasure irrespective of how it is perceived by the vast majority. For most 
    others this intrinsic individual sense of like or dislike is absent or is so 
    weak that it is often overshadowed and is primarily determined by extrinsic 
    factors mentioned above. This is what is known as the &quot; meme&quot; factor, 
    originally introduced by Sociobiologist Dawkins (Elaborately discussed in 
    Susan Blackmore's &quot;The Meme Machine&quot;). This meme effect can get so powerful 
    that one loses the discriminating ability of a true art connoisseur and 
    blindly loves ANY work of an artist and cannot discriminate between 
    individual pieces of work according to any subjective criteria, nor do they 
    care to. The artist to such a fan becomes a cult, a fad, fashion, a symbol 
    of prestige. And for them the liking for arts seem to develop by broad 
    categories like Classical, Jazz, Rock, Tagore Songs for music. Or Science 
    Fiction, Adventure, Romance etc for literature, and they would like anything 
    under those broad categories with no exception (Although there may be 
    variation of lthe intensity liking within a category but it would still be a 
    like, not a dislike). Let us label them type &quot;A&quot; fans (fans subject to the 
    meme effect). For a few discriminating persons this likes or dislikes may 
    not be defined by these broad categories but by certain individual 
    subjective criterion specific to that person. For them it is possible that 
    they may like some items within a given category but may find no appeal in 
    some other items inside it. Let us call these minority fans (not subject to 
    meme effect) as type &quot;B&quot;. It is observed quite often that when &quot;X&quot; states 
    his/ her interest in some art form of a certain category, many invariably 
    assume X as being type &quot;A&quot;. The possibility of X being a type &quot;B&quot; art 
    enthusiast usually escapes their mind. This is evident from their gifts to X 
    of books, CDs, invitations to concerts or recitals etc by ANY artists in 
    that category, not considering the possibility that X may be a type &quot;B&quot; fan 
    and may not like that particular book, CD or concert etc. Moreover, when X, 
    doesn't show interest in a specific book, song, concert under that category, 
    X is perceived by many as not having any interest in that category at all, 
    not realizing that this may be due to the discriminating taste of a type B 
    art enthusiast. This is a common fallacy. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question of greatness and liking 
    in art is purely a subjective one. It is hard to come up with a universally 
    acceptable objective criteria to judge artistic greatness. Volume, 
    popularity, consensus of the critics are usually the common criteria. The 
    market usually decides what is great(est). Public tastes are moldable by 
    various extrinsic factor. But the criteria for an individual's liking or 
    disliking of an art(ist) is purely subjective, unique to that individual. 
    But whatever that unique subjective criteria is , it is certain that not ALL 
    work of a given artist or genre will be equally appealing to anyone, 
    certainly not to a type B fan. The fact is that famous musicians, poets, 
    novelists etc who have created volumes of artwork are bound to create quite 
    a few which are inferior in quality under any subjective criteria. Not all 
    their works can be equally evocative to a discerning taste. A type B fan 
    need not like all works within a given genre of arts. Discrimination and 
    selectivity is an essential mark of type B fans. The beauty of art is in the 
    eye of the beholder. By the same token, under any subjective criteria, it is 
    quite possible, that a specific piece of work by artist &quot;X&quot; can appeal more 
    than a specific piece of work by artist &quot;Y&quot;, although overall &quot;Y&quot; may appeal 
    more than &quot;X&quot; Of course with some objective criteria, like volume, number of 
    copies sold, critics' verdict etc one can decide the greatest, but such 
    criteria should have no meaning to a type B fan. To him/her liking or 
    dislike should be intrinsic, not influenced by polls, numbers and statistics 
    or any other extrinsic factors.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now coming back to the issue of 
    greatness in art. How is it decided, in case of an individual artist? If 
    greatness of an artist is assessed retroactively by the award of say Nobel 
    prize, sure he is. If assessed by the number of works, then also he is. But 
    all these are post hoc criteria, volume and popularity is assumed to result 
    from greatness. That leaves the question begging as to what is greatness ? 
    We have a circularity here. Greatness is defined as that which leads to 
    volume and popularity, whereas popularity and volume is viewed as resulting 
    from greatness. There has to be some APRIORI intrinsic criteria of greatness 
    to break this circularity. There ISN'T ANY! Art is inherently intuitive, 
    subjective. Of course to an individual, although the appeal is subjective, 
    there can be deeper objective factors deciding his/her tastes, like certain 
    distinctive imageries and metaphors to describe nature, human emotions, 
    certain choice of expressions, certain notes or chords or riffs (in songs), 
    etc (Style in one word). But these are not possible to quantify and written 
    down as criteria of greatness for ALL to agree on. Such subjective criteria 
    is appropriate for deciding greatness at an individual level to a type B 
    fans.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now good and bad in arts being 
    subjective, use of such label is improper and meaningless. Despite that 
    people are seen to rave about authors, stories, movies, music etc saying 
    they are &quot;great&quot; &quot;outstanding&quot; etc (Without qualifying it by &quot;TO ME&quot;). If 
    these attributes of &quot;great&quot;, &quot;outstanding&quot; etc are defined by the &quot;volume&quot; 
    and publicity of these works then it IS OBJECTIVE. If it is due to their 
    &quot;quality&quot; then it IS a SUBJECTIVE judgement and hence requires &quot; TO ME&quot;. 
    Even in the case where &quot;greatness' etc is decided by fame and publicity one 
    has to look carefully into how this fame or publicity came about. If it came 
    about by independent AND simultaneous reading and judgement of their work by 
    large number of people then there will be some authenticity to it. But in 
    many cases it happens by an iterative reinforcement or snowball effect 
    whereby more and more people hear or read ABOUT the &quot;fabulous&quot; work of an 
    artist and are purely led to believe in the greatness of an artwork or 
    artists by this sheer publicity rather than by judging by themselves it's 
    intrinsic appeal (TO THEM) and they themselves then act as a further 
    propagator of this fame and adds to this publicity by reinforcing it further 
    (The ubiquitous meme effect). That is not to say that the artists would not 
    have appealed to them had they not heard about its &quot;greatness&quot;. But it is 
    also possible the work of someone not so famous may have appealed equally or 
    more in the absence of the meme effect which acts as an extrinsic agent of 
    influence and either completely forfeits or significantly impair one's 
    intrinsic faculty of judging likes and dislikes. If &quot;X&quot; mentions to &quot;Y&quot; a 
    poetry, a quote or precept of a &quot;famous&quot; person claiming to be his/her own 
    and if &quot;Y&quot; is not familiar with it then there is a good chance &quot;Y&quot; may not 
    be quite impressed by it, whereas if &quot;X&quot; had quoted it as being of a famous 
    person, then &quot;Y&quot; would show an appreciative response! The same is true about 
    motivational speakers, celebrities . When they address an admiring audience. 
    The most trivially true statements seem to create much more sense of awe on 
    the audience than it would have been, if told by some one ordinary without 
    mentioning that they were quoting those celebrities.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Interestingly, if someone KNOWS a 
    certain symphony or classical musical piece to be famous and &quot;deep&quot;, he/she 
    may listen to it and rave about it while nodding head in awe, but if the 
    same music is played regularly as a background music for say a TV show and 
    didn't know or realize it to be a famous musical piece, he/she may only 
    identify the music with just the show and not feel any interest in listening 
    to the music itself but only will try to reminisce about the show that it 
    conjures up!</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tied in with above discussion is the 
    fact that artistic and aesthetic sense or perceptivity is an intrinsic 
    quality or attribute of a person which is not created or increased by mere 
    READING or exposure to an art work. A person may be endowed with this 
    inherent ability to appreciate art and a sense of aesthetics yet have not 
    read a lot of artistic work by others but would nevertheless be able to 
    appreciate it more when they read it than who has read a lot and can talk 
    about them in a descriptive manner yet doesn't have the same deep artistic 
    appreciation or sensitivity of it as the former. An art school education 
    does not increase the inherent artistic sense of a person but only helps to 
    bring out whatever is inside to its max. A given engineer or scientist or 
    whatever does not necessarily posses less inherent artistic sense than a 
    given artist, its just that one has it latent, undeveloped, while the other 
    has developed it into its max. It is true that those who have &quot;higher&quot; 
    intrinsic artistic sense tend also to chose to become professional artist 
    and develop it but there are significant exceptions to that rule.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me summarize the meme effects 
    responsible for the fame of an artist can be due to certain combination of 
    factors , as follows: (In the following &quot;outstanding&quot; and &quot;mediocre&quot; are 
    judged mainly by critics and to some extent by popularity, as reflected in 
    media and sales etc which may or may not be in sync with the critics 
    always).</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. Some extraordinary work and a 
      large volume of mediocre work and the snowball effect of publicity, plug, 
      hype generated by the extraordinary ones. Then naive minds may &quot;like&quot; even 
      just the mediocre ones while never having read the extra-ordinary ones, 
      being controlled by the meme effects of the publicity/hype.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Large volume of work, none of 
      extraordinary level, but due to sheer large volume and a fortuitous 
      condition of being at the right place at the right time, gained publicity 
      and fed into the hyp to create an aura of fame around his/her name.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is possible that some not so 
    famous artists may have created a similar number of extra-ordinary work as a 
    famous one but not having created large volume of average work didn't get 
    the benefit of snowball effect of mass or media hyp.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now some thoughts on the connection 
    of arts to real life. Here it is observed that movies, novels which contain 
    in its 3 hours/300 pages or so some cameos of deep philosophical, 
    psychological realizations of life, human emotions etc (expressible in few 
    words or sentences), attract rave reviews from viewers, readers for those 
    contents whereas the same people would dismiss reading or hearing the same 
    profound truths, realizations as boring and academic when heard or read as 
    isolated statements from an individual or in a non-fiction book.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Just as kids only like to learn math 
    if it is taught through fun and entertainment some grown ups too retain this 
    vestiges of childish propensity and can only accept insights and truths if 
    adorned with extra layers of humour or romance, fiction and verbiage etc. In 
    most cases a much raved poem, song, story or movie when stripped off its 
    garnishing boils down to a trivial statement of a fact of life that one may 
    already know. So when touting such poems, songs, stories or movies as a must 
    read, must hear to others one has to be clear about the message and the mode 
    of the message in them and draw a distinction. They have to be aware that 
    the mode part is subjective and may not appeal to someone else who may still 
    know or appreciate the message already, and thus not jump to the conclusion 
    that he/she doesn't' t have the &quot;depth&quot; to understand the inherent message 
    just because he/she didn't appreciate the mode of the message. Often by 
    making mode quite appealing some naive minds can be made to elevate a 
    trivial precept or paradigm to a sublime level. On the other hand an 
    enlightened but not so naive mind can be moved by the sheer beauty or 
    artistry of the mode of the message and yet realize the trivial nature of 
    the message ( if any, an art need not have a message always). One has to 
    separate out philosophy, psychology etc aspect from the entertainment aspect 
    in an art and if one is interested in the former then instead of wasting 
    time one can directly read core works on philosophy, psychology and if 
    interested in entertainment, then of course performing arts is the 
    appropriate avenue. In a combination, one must realize the secondary aspect 
    of the philosophy part in any art form. Certainly one feels entertained to 
    see certain human emotions and aspirations powefully illustrated by some 
    actors and performers through the skills of writers and directors and of 
    course their own artistic skill. But whatever philosophical, social or 
    psychological insights or messages there are in a movie,poem, story etc, as 
    I said, can be reduced to few lines or minutes. And there is nothing in them 
    that has not been discussed, expressed or analyzed by Philosophers,

    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And to think that all of the above 
    are torn of any extra layers of fictional or entertainment materials. One 
    can imagine what their size would have been if extra layers of fiction, 
    entertainment were added to the facts contained therein! Besides them there 
    are innumerable scholarly books and journals on all aspects of life. Some 
    people mention certain poems, songs, fictions etc as having influenced or 
    changed their lives or seek inspiration to drive their life from them. 
    Poems, songs, movies etc are poor sources to seek for inspiring truths and 
    insights about life. Real life and nature, when observed and studied with a 
    reflective and analytical mind is a much more reliable source or guide to 
    truth. Reading works on philosophy, psychology, biology, logic, ethics etc 
    are better and more cost-effective means and sources of learning about 
    insights of life than fictional works. Fictional works are more suited to 
    entertainment aspect of life. We all yearn for words, rhythms, riffs, 
    expressions, music, pictures etc that evoke our very individual inner 
    artistic sensitivity and appeals to our soul. It helps to uplift our spirit 
    when we do come across a piece of artwork in which we see reflections of 
    those very emotions and feelings of our inner self. But we should get beyond 
    that whe it comes to real life which should be guided by real life factors 
    and considerations and not handicapped by dreams, fantasies, poems, fictions 
    and dictated by them. Depending on a movie or poem to understand facts and 
    truths of life and to seek inspiration from it is the height of naivette. 
    Our external life has to be based on reality independent of art. One should 
    not depend on a poem to decide their course of action but should be guided 
    by his/her own head (using knowledge and experience) and instinct. 
    Dependency leads to self deceit. Art is mainly to cater to our subjective 
    need of our inner life, to find an expression and reflection of our inner 
    soul .</font></p>
