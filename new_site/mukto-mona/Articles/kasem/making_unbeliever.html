  <span lang="EN-AU" style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">UITE OFTEN I 
  RECEIVE E-MAILS asking me why I have so much dislike for religion in general 
  and Islam, my religion at birth, in particular. This question is not easy to 
  answer. A person’s religion is the most sacred, and to some, the most valuable 
  asset one may claim to possess. Wars are waged, genocide perpetrated, 
  friendships broken, love turned into hatred, peace into turmoil, harmony into 
  discord, enlightenment into darkness just because of religious difference. 
  Nothing is more sensitive and dangerous than fomenting the religious feeling 
  of people. As demonstrated by many suicide bombers, many believers consider 
  their faith more precious than their own lives. Under such scenarios, it is 
  not so simple for any one to look at his religion of birth critically. Many 
  years, possibly decades of observations, experience, study and contemplation 
  are required to examine one’s so-called religion of birth.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span class="HTMLTypewriter2">
  <span lang="EN-AU" style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">Below, I have 
  listed a few issues that may make an ardent believer to question his/her 
  ‘religion of birth’, and may eventually turn him into an unbeliever. These 
  listed concerns are not comprehensive. As the current events unfold, there 
  will be many new aspects that may be more critical than what I have mentioned. 
  Please spend a little time and ponder on what might turn a believer into an 
  unbeliever.</span><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></span></span></p>

  Four million diehard devotees (the Biswa Ijtema in Bangladesh) from many 
  Islamic Paradises beseech Allah in three languages (Bengali, Urdu and Arabic) 
  for His blessings. Yet Allah keeps these countries the most corrupt, the least 
  developed, the most crime-infested, utterly terrorised and amongst the poorest 
  in the world. You start doubting if Allah ever understood any of those 
  languages of prayer, especially His own language, that is, Arabic. This 
  epidemic of prayer has been going on for decades, but Allah remains adamant. 
  To the total chagrin of the true believers, Allah continues to bestow 
  prosperity to the infidels. You question the fairness of Allah.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  When the Mullahs are in power in one of the Islamic Paradises (e.g., 
  Bangladesh) great deluge of flood creates havoc there. The Mullahs term this 
  devastating natural calamity as a test of <i>Iman</i> (faith) from Allah—just 
  like Nuh’s flood. Curiously, when a secular government is elected to power, 
  the same Mullahs call the raging flood a punishment from Allah for the 
  electorate for choosing a secular government. You marvel at the capricious 
  mind of Allah.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  When a 14-year-old boy is mercilessly flogged to death (in Iran) in the month 
  of Ramadan for not fasting strictly to the stringent specifications of the 
  religion you question the very authenticity of Allah’s Scripture on which this 
  punishment is meted out.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">A 
  16-year-old girl (in Iran) is raped by gangsters but she cannot prove her 
  innocence for lack of resources to hire a competent lawyer. The Mullahs 
  swiftly hang her in public without giving her a right to appeal. Her rapists 
  go scot-free. You tremble in fear as you have a few teen-age daughters. You 
  are frightened to death thinking what might happen to your young daughters if 
  they become victims of similar rape.</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  Allah decides to send His soldiers to kindergarten schools to slaughter 
  infidels’ infants (Beslan in Russia). This action of Allah shakes the very 
  foundation of your belief. You assume the savage perpetrators of this 
  infanticide were not true believers. When you consult the <i>Hadis</i> you are 
  profoundly shocked to learn that wanton killing of infidels’ children is 
  religiously sanctioned. You become fearful about the safety of your own child 
  when he/she is enrolled in a childcare/pre-school/kindergarten. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  You remember your past secret love life and suddenly learn from newspaper 
  reports that a hapless widow in an Islamic Paradise is to be stoned to death 
  for merely becoming pregnant and giving birth to an innocent daughter out of 
  wed-lock. You thank yourself that none of those women with whom you had 
  illicit sex became pregnant. You wonder what would have happened if you were 
  caught. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  You sincerely fall in love with an infidel woman but you cannot marry her 
  unless she embraces the ‘religion of tolerance’. You and your lover decide to 
  flee the Islamic Paradise and immigrate to an infidel land just to exercise 
  your fundamental human right. &nbsp;</span></font></p>

  You and your wife for 12-years go on a holiday trip to a scenic beach resort 
  (e.g., the state of Trengganu in Malaysia). You lodge in the luxurious beach 
  hotel Club Med. Out of blue; at the dead of night, the religious police heckle 
  you demanding to witness your marriage certificate. Unable to produce the 
  matrimony document, you and your wife have no choice but to be hand-cuffed and 
  immediately whisked by the ‘guardians of Allah’ to be locked up in dingy 
  cells. You and your distraught wife are separated and threatened with lashing 
  until you can prove your Islamic marriage. You desperately fax to your 
  relative to send you the original marriage certificate. Until that arrives you 
  and your dear wife spend a few weeks in tenterhook. While all the infidel 
  guests at the resort sleep in peace you suffer this despicable indignation 
  because you have an Islamic (read Arabic) name. After you return to your home 
  of infidels you promise not to set foot in an Islamic Paradise, ever.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  You visit Thailand, the land of smiles. Out of curiosity you visit a massage 
  parlour or a Turkish bath. Inside the dimly-lit premise you spot your bearded 
  but impeccably western-dressed <i>Tabligi</i> friends who were once your 
  university mates. Astounded, you ask them what <i>Tabligi</i> work they are 
  doing in such a sex joint. To your utter surprise your <i>Tabligi</i> friends 
  tell you that Thai massage girls/prostitutes are <i>halal</i> for them. They 
  claim that while they may have wives and children at <i>Dar-ul-Islam</i> (home 
  country of Islam) but since they are in a <i>Dar-ul-Harb</i> (the land of 
  warfare) or the land of infidels, it is alright for them to have sex with Thai 
  women as these sex-kittens are like captives to the Muslims. You return home 
  and check the <i>Sharia</i> book (Islamic Law) for their outrageous claim. To 
  your complete disbelief you find that the <i>Sharia</i> fully supports your <i>
  Tabligi</i> friends’ claims. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  You attend the party of an infidel colleague and drink only orange juice 
  because all other foods ostensibly look <i>haram</i>. But you have no courage 
  to ask your host. When the host enquires if anything is wrong with you, you 
  tell a lie that you have stomach problem, or that you are not hungry. You 
  become ashamed that you have to tell lies because of your faith.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  When you tell your best friend that you like western life-style and enjoy its 
  freedom he cuts you off from the list of his guest. He stops phoning you, and 
  when you enquire about his well-being he says he is busy and has very little 
  time. Religion has now stood between you and your best friend.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  Your infidel neighbour invites you to his Christmas gala party but you pretend 
  to be sick because you know alcoholic drinks will be served. You note that 
  despite being teetotaller throughout their lives most Muslims have very poor 
  health and quite short life-span. You genuinely question why you could not 
  drink a sip or two of <i>haram </i>drink while the infidels can easily indulge 
  in such absolute <i>haram</i> practice, yet they enjoy far superior health 
  than the Muslims. You wonder why the infidels can enjoy wine, beer, whisky, 
  port, Martini, Cinzano, Remy Martin, VSOP brandy, champagne, shandy but you 
  have to be contented only with Mecca Cola or orange juice!&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  Your father threatens to kick you out of his house because you went out dating 
  with boys/girls of the infidels. You wonder why you cannot have an easy mixing 
  with opposite sex. Crossed, you decide to get even with your parents at an 
  appropriate time.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  When your child visits his infidel friend’s house you give your child the 
  strict order not to eat or drink any foodstuff as you suspect that they may 
  not be <i>halal</i>. Your child is simply agitated, sad, confused when he 
  observes that while he has to go hungry, all other children can happily eat 
  the delicious food served. He does not understand why he has to practice such 
  dim-witted food habits. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  When you plan to visit another city/town you desperately seek <i>halal</i> 
  restaurants even though they serve smelly, stale food in very unhygienic 
  premises. You refuse to eat nutritious food served in a superbly hygienic, 
  delightfully pleasant and plush comfortable environment simply because these 
  food outlets are patronised by the <i>haram-eating</i> infidels. You simply 
  cannot find any logic behind this bizarre practice. Nevertheless, you go ahead 
  with the herd of believers as you do not want to lose your standing in the 
  community <i>(Ummah).&nbsp; </i>Deep inside, you question your faith but are afraid 
  to become an outcast.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  When the Allah’s soldiers (in Iraq) behead the dedicated aid workers, ordinary 
  poor labourers, engineers, doctors and make snuff videos for the <i>Ummah</i> 
  to watch the mercy of ‘religion of compassion’ you have great difficulty 
  explaining this ‘religion of compassion’ to your colleagues. You even try to 
  hide your face when the neighbours learn that you belong to the ‘religion of 
  compassion.’&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  When you are in an infidel land you try to conceal your ‘religion of 
  forgiveness’ by faking an infidel name to a stranger. You try to hide the 
  passport issued by an Islamic Paradise. You show it only to the immigration 
  officials. You wonder why you have to play such a hide-and-seek game.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  Your family hates you for becoming friendly with the infidels. You become very 
  sad, but later, you find out that they are simply following the commands of 
  all Powerful Allah. Consulting the Holy Scripture, you find out that a Muslim 
  son must disown his own parents and vice versa if they or you do not convert 
  to Islam. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  You go to a religious school and find that girls, as little as 6 or 
  7-years-old are forced to wear ugly <i>Hijab.</i> When the confused innocent 
  little girls ask for the reason of wearing such tormenting apparel, you hear 
  the <i>‘Hujur’</i> (religious teacher) says Allah loves those girls who 
  ‘cover’ themselves. He also says that the infidel girls (those who do not wear
  <i>Hijab</i>) are prostitutes, harlots and characterless. You wonder how come 
  Allah did not cover these little <i>Muslimahs</i> during their birth—why Allah 
  let them be born naked!&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  Your child goes to a <i>Madrassah</i> (a theological seminary) to memorise the 
  Holy Scripture. When he returns home he/she complains about the beating he/she 
  received at the hands of the <i>‘Hujur’.</i> When you confront the <i>‘Hujur’</i> 
  for child-abuse he shows you the irrefutable proof that beating a child is 
  allowed as per <i>Hadis</i>. You simply shake your head in disbelief, but the
  <i>‘Hujur’</i> shows you the clear proof from the Holy Scriptures. You truly 
  become dumb-founded.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

  As a migrant you sincerely believe that the best way to be the integral part 
  of a society is to mix with the local mainstream people, become friendly with 
  them and learn some of their traditions and customs. When you visit a mosque 
  you hear the <i>Imam</i> warns the congregation not to be friendly with the 
  local infidels. He even exhorts that as a believer you must endeavour to 
  convert the local infidels to adopt your culture and religion. Doubting <i>
  Imam’s </i>preaching, you check the Holy Scriptures. You are utterly shocked 
  that the Imam is absolutely correct.</span></font></p>

  You live in an Islamic Paradise which preaches ‘religious tolerance’, ‘peace’, 
  ‘democracy’, ‘freedom of thought’………When you visit the religious congregation 
  of the infidels to learn about their religion you are arrested, fined or 
  imprisoned (e.g., in .Malaysia) for patronising the enemies of the ‘religion 
  of tolerance’. You question the very Holy words ‘No compulsion in religion.’&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  In an Islamic Paradise you go out dating an infidel girl. While both of you 
  are seated on a wooden bench in the local park, the ‘moral guardians’ of Allah 
  (religious police), checks your I.D., arrests you, fines you and jails you. 
  Your infidel girl-friend goes scot-free. You question how could there be two 
  sets of laws in one country? You decide that this is nothing but religious 
  apartheid. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  In a moderate Muslim Paradise (e.g., Malaysia) you visit a pub or a disco to 
  have a good time with your infidel friends. There, you notice the religious 
  police checking the I.D. of each patron. Wondering how come the ‘religion of 
  tolerance’ would not allow you such a simple pleasure, you sneak out of the <i>
  haram</i> premise. Meanwhile, your infidel friends had a ‘good time’ in the 
  pub, while you returned home and asked Allah’s forgiveness.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">
  Your religious-scholar friend tells you that Allah’s ‘only’ religion has lots 
  of goodies for women. When you open the newspaper (in Pakistan) you read, 'Let 
  these women be warned,' said a mullah to the dissenting women of Rawalpindi. 
  'We will tear them to pieces. We will give them such terrible punishments that 
  no one in future will dare to raise a voice against Islam.' In desperation you 
  consult the Holy Scriptures and find that the Mullahs are completely correct. 
  You start doubting your friend’s scholarship on the good stuff for women in 
  the ‘religion for women’.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

  Even though you are not ethnically an Arab, you must keep an Arabic name, 
  follow Arabic culture; adopt their food, clothing, hygiene and toilet habits; 
  memorise their Holy Scriptures without comprehending a single word of it and 
  prostrate endlessly to their Allah. When you go on pilgrimage or when they 
  hire you as slaves to work for them they ridicule you as a <i>‘miskin’</i> 
  (indigent). But they treat the white infidel workers with respect and offer 
  them higher pay and more fringe benefits than the black and brown immigrant 
  workers (like you) .Though you are better qualified than many of them (white 
  infidels) your Arab brothers discriminate you against the white infidel 
  workers,. As a general rule, you are paid half compared to a white unbeliever. 
  Yet, you consider the Arabs superior to you and you imitate their dress and 
  Bedouin habits. Some Islamic Paradises (like Pakistan) even broadcast news in 
  Arabic when not even 0.1% of their population understand the Arabic language. 
  You wonder why a desperately poor country should spend money to Arabise its 
  population? &nbsp;</span></font></p>

  When you question your religion you fear for your life. When you make a movie 
  that criticises the religion of ‘peace’ you are beheaded <i>a la</i> Islamic 
  style. &nbsp;</span></font></p>

  Those are some of the issues all believers should ponder upon. Thanks to the 
  advent of Internet; it is now possible to publicise those pertinent points. We 
  must welcome well-designed, easily navigable websites that highlight the 
  concerns mentioned above and shake the minds of the believers, compelling them 
  to re-think what they always thought to be the eternal truth.</span></font></p>
