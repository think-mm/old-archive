  <p>In my opinion its the the same story and in some cases with even the same 
  players (some with blood drenched hands) from 35 years ago. No offense meant. 
  We the &quot;seculars&quot; lost because we just became too sectarian, indulged in 
  minute hair splitting and while the fox wreaked havoc in the henhouse for the 
  last two decades. They are in charge now we have woken up or have we? </p>
  <p>I am glad that Zafar wrote this piece and I hope we can get over it swiftly 
  and move on to take back what we let slip from our grip 30 years ago. </p>

  generation </b><br>
  </font>Zafar Sobhan <br>
  Daily Star </p>
  <p>December 16 always brings to my mind the experiences and perspectives of 
  the 71 generation who were shaped by the liberation war. I define the 71 
  generation as those who were old enough to experience the turmoil of the 1960s 
  and the 1970s, and especially 1971 and 1975 and their aftermath, first-hand. 
  For better or for worse, it has been this generation that has guided the 
  affairs of the country since liberation. </p>
  <p>I have noticed that many of the pieces that writers of this generation 
  produce every December 16 have a similar tone to them. The pieces are almost 
  all ritualistic disquisitions on where we have come to as a nation since 1971, 
  and there is an almost uniform sense of disappointment running through them.
  </p>
  <p>The authors begin with an inspiring depiction of the heroics and sacrifices 
  and glories of the liberation war and how they had such high hopes for the 
  future of the country, but this quickly gives way to the disillusionment of 
  the present, as they look around and realise that their hopes and dreams 
  remain unfulfilled, and that the country has fallen far short of the promise 
  of that day when everything seemed possible. </p>
  <p>Reading these pieces every year, I am reminded that for those of the 71 
  generation, the last thirty-three years have been difficult ones, and that 
  they do feel a profound sadness for their unfulfilled hopes and dreams, and 
  that this is why they cannot help but look back on December 16 with sorrow as 
  well as pride. </p>
  <p>The differences between the 71 generation and the post-71 generation are 
  never more apparent to me then when I read those pieces. I am reminded of the 
  concluding lines to King Lear: </p>
  <p>The weight of this sad time we must obey; Speak what we feel, not what we 
  ought to say. The oldest hath borne most: we that are young Shall never see so 
  much, nor live so long. </p>
  <p>I have noticed that writing from the perspective of what I would call the 
  post-71 generation, my outlook and understanding differs a little from that of 
  those who experienced first-hand the blood-soaked birth of Bangladesh and its 
  tumultuous aftermath, and this makes me wonder about further implications of 
  the differences between the generations. </p>
  <p>I think for the 71 generation, December 16 has become a time to look back 
  at the troubled history of our country and count our losses and missed 
  opportunities. </p>
  <p>This is, of course, understandable. The Bangladesh we live in today is not 
  the Bangladesh anyone hoped for. </p>
  <p>I can still remember glancing through a letter that my father's close 
  friend Prof. Mosharraf Hossain gave me to take to my father when he was 
  recovering from heart surgery some years ago and being struck by the poignancy 
  of his words. </p>
  <p>Even today, sometimes his words come back to me as I think of the 71 
  generation and all that they have seen and experienced: &quot;Remember how we used 
  to dream of raising a brave new world in this hapless land of ours?&quot; </p>
  <p>Even those who have done well personally in the years since 
  independence--and there is no shortage of success stories--must be saddened by 
  the state of the country as a whole. </p>
  <p>So, I do understand the mixed emotions that the 71 generation feels on this 
  day. </p>
  <p>But I think that it is a little different for the post-71 generation. </p>
  <p>I think as a generation we don't have that sense of crushing 
  disillusionment. Things might not be all that we would want them to be, but 
  frankly I can't really remember a time when things were all that much better 
  than they are now -- and I can certainly remember times when things were 
  worse. </p>
  <p>Don't get me wrong. </p>
  <p>There is much to bemoan about the state of the nation and those who read my 
  column will know that bemoan them I regularly do. </p>
  <p>In many ways, things are looking as grim for us today as they have been for 
  a long time. The democratic consensus seems to be breaking down and we have 
  reached a new low in terms of corruption and politicisation. </p>
  <p>This year we have had floods and terrorist attacks and mass imprisonments 
  and rigged polls to contend with, and the politics of the country appears to 
  be heading in the direction of confrontation as we enter the new year. </p>
  <p>But to my mind there is one reason to be hopeful -- and that is that a 
  generational shift is slowly taking place from the 71 generation to the 
  post-71 generation in the corridors of power and at the commanding heights of 
  the economy. </p>
  <p>It's the most ironic of paradoxes. The very generation that brought us our 
  greatest moment and that we will always look to with pride is the same 
  generation that has been unable to vanquish its own demons and establish a 
  stable and sustainable polity in post-independence Bangladesh. </p>
  <p>The sixties and seventies -- which were the crucible in which their 
  identities were forged -- were rough and brutal times in this country. </p>
  <p>As bad as things might be now, and for all the stories we have been told on 
  long winter nights, the post-71 generation really can't begin to comprehend 
  how things were in those blood-soaked and terror-filled days. </p>
  <p>The differences we see today among the warring factions in the nation stem 
  from those days -- and that's why they are so intractable. That's why among 
  the 71 generation there can be no compromise. There can never be forgiveness 
  and reconciliation. There has been too much blood shed and too much hardship 
  suffered. </p>
  <p>The story of the 71 generation is a story of broken dreams and betrayals.
  </p>
  <p>The post-71 generation lives in more prosaic times. We are more pragmatic 
  and less emotional. More realistic and less ideological. </p>
  <p>Our feuds are not blood feuds, and our history is not one of ancient enmity 
  and bitterness. </p>
  <p>Our differences are not matters of life and death. We are not committed to 
  forever re-fighting the same old battles over and over again. </p>
  <p>No doubt this is something of an over-simplification. I have not gone into 
  the fundamental reasons for the differences that split the Bangladeshi polity 
  and the rights and the wrongs of the matter. That is a subject for another 
  day. </p>
  <p>I am merely pointing out that, due to the long bloody history behind the 
  animosities between the warring factions, the 71 generation has never been 
  able to resolve its differences, but that the post-71 generation might be able 
  to. </p>
  <p>To be sure, there is the other side of the coin when it comes to the 
  post-71 generation. </p>
  <p>Not having experienced the struggle for independence first-hand, we do not 
  have that same sense of ownership and patriotism with respect to the country 
  that the 71 generation does. </p>
  <p>The flip-side of our pragmatism and realism is that idealism and a sense of 
  social responsibility are in short supply. As a generation we are irredeemably 
  materialistic and self-seeking. This is the tenor of the times in which we 
  live -- and it is not a change for the better. </p>
  <p>Many would look at the new generation of politicians and the growing nexus 
  between crime and affairs of state, and scoff at the notion that redemption 
  can possibly lie in the hands of a generation such as this. </p>
  <p>Many would argue that, unmoored from the crucial formative experience of 
  the liberation struggle that inspired a generation to devote their lives to 
  building up the nation, the country will head into even greater turmoil in the 
  years ahead, and that the passing of the torch from the hands of the 71 
  generation signals the beginning of the end. </p>
  <p>They might not be wrong either. It would be another over-simplification to 
  suggest that power passing to the post-71 generation will necessarily usher in 
  an era of civility and cooperation. But what I am suggesting is that with the 
  historical differences less prominent and the historical inequities less raw a 
  compromise will at least be thinkable. </p>
  <p>I retain the hope that the enduring legacy of the generational shift that 
  is taking place in Bangladesh is that the ghosts of 1971 and its aftermath can 
  finally be laid to rest, and that we can as a nation finally move out of the 
  twilight and into the bright sunshine of a new day. </p>
