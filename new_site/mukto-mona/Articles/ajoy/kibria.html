  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A brilliant product of Dacca 
	University of early fifties, a renowned economist of the country, a 
	knowledgeable person in socio-politico-cultural field, a successful career 
	diplomat, a fairly successful erstwhile finance minister and a devoted 
	member of parliament (MP) became the latest victim of fundamentalists. One 
	of the finest and culturally polished gentlemen, I have ever come across, is 
	no more. He breathed his last, perhaps while he was being rushed to Dhaka 
	from Habiganj following a grenade thrown directly at him in a public meeting 
	at Habignaj his home district on Thursday evening (~ 7-15 p.m.) on 27th 
	January. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No, I would not ask the silly 
	question ‘who killed him’, because I know the answer- though I don’t know 
	the killer’s name. Does it matter? Surely not. I know their cultural and 
	political identities, their association. Yes, the killers are 
	fundamentalists belonging to extremist Islamic group being nourished and 
	protected by Khaleda Begum led 4-party Islamic alliance government. 
	According to news reaching Dhaka, Late Kibria hardly completed his speech in 
	a public meeting held at Baidyer Bazar Primary School field, organized by 
	local AL, a powerful grenade was thrown at him while he was coming down of 
	the dais. The pattern bears a striking similarity with the incident of 21 
	August and killing of Ahsanullah Master of Gazipur, another prominent and 
	popular AL leader. On all three occasions the terrorists, agents of 4-party 
	alliance attacked the victims in public meetings as they were descending 
	from the dais. At the Habiganj incident, apart from Kibria other four local 
	AL workers including a nephew (Shah Manju) of the erstwhile finance minister 
	died instantaneously. Not less than 200 hundreds were severely injured. The 
	devastating incident is indicative of the power of the grenade thrown. It is 
	not just home made bomb or explosive device. As the grenade was thrown it 
	exploded with cracking sound, and Mr. Kibria was found to fell down on the 
	ground. His two legs were thrown out of his abdomen receiving splinters 
	injury on head and chest. Needless to say a situation of panic, confusion 
	and melee followed. The victims were taken to local hospitals and clinics. 
	In an injured condition Kibria and several others were brought to Dhaka 
	BARDEM hospital at about 11 p.m. Although he was taken to operation theatre 
	immediately, but he was declared dead by the doctors. The doctors opined 
	that he probably died on the way because of profuse bleeding. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A bureaucrat turned to politician 
	late Sha A M S Kibria hailed from greater Sylhet and was born in 1st May 
	1931. He graduated with honors in economics and obtained M.A degree in the 
	same subject in 1952 and 1953 respectively from Dacca University. On both 
	occasions he stood first among the first classes. According to the 
	prevailing tradition then obtaining among the bright boys of the university, 
	Kibria sat for central superior service (CSP) examination of Pakistan and 
	stood first. He opted for Foreign Service and continued there in various 
	capacities from 1757-70. During our liberation war, there was a Bengali 
	elite group in Washington Embassy of Pakistan which included Enayet Karim, 
	Shah A M S Kibria, AMM Muhit, Professor Abu Rushd Matinuddin (educational 
	attaché), Moazzem Ali (third secretary) and number of PFS officers like 
	Rustam Ali, Razzak Khan, and Shariful Alam etc. Mr. Kibria defected from 
	Pakistan Embassy for free Government of Bangladesh led by Tazuddin Ahmed on 
	4th August 1971. Under his editorship a news bulletin was published during 
	the period of liberation war. He whole-heartedly engaged himself for the 
	cause of Bangladesh till independent Bangladesh emerged on 16th December 
	1971. After the independence Kibria was appointed Director General of the 
	political wing of the newly created foreign ministry. Later (1972), was 
	promoted to post of Foreign Secretary and was given the charge of 
	establishing embassies of Bangladesh at different countries. He became 
	Ambassador of Bangladesh at UNO as well as permanent representative to UNO 
	in 1976. In 1978 he once again was made foreign secretary till 1981 when he 
	retired from the service. At different times he worked as ambassadors of 
	USA, India, Egypt, and Indonesia. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1992 he joined AL as a member of 
	the advisory council, then became political advisor of AL chief Sheikh 
	Hasina. He was made finance minister when AL came to power. He got elected 
	from Habiganj-3 constituency to become member of the parliament (MP) in 2001 
	election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During his student life he took part 
	in –52 language movement and suffered one month imprisonment. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Entire Country enraged: </font>
	</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Following the death of Kibria and 
	other 4 AL workers the country expressed its anguish and anger through 
	spontaneous demonstrations, which continued throughout the day today (28. 
	01. 05). Following Namaje Janaja at Baitul Mokarram the procession with the 
	dead body proceeded towards central shahid minar. The procession soon turned 
	into a stormy and angry mass, which demolished and burnt many auto vehicles 
	as it finally arrived at Shahid Minar where thousands of mourners of all 
	walks of life paid tribute to the tragically departed soul. The police all 
	on a sudden resorted to lathi charge and tear gassing on the otherwise 
	peaceful gathering. This followed a police-mob clash for a long time. The 
	peace returned when the procession left the minar premise to BARDEM where 
	his dead body would be preserved for a day or so. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ambassadors of the European 
	countries led by British High Commissioner Anowar Choudhury today saw Mrs. 
	Artist Asma Kibria, wife of Late Kibria to pay their respect and condolence. 
	On behalf of the ambassadors British HC to BD expressed their concern over 
	repeated killing of important personalities so openly, and deplored 
	government’s failure to stop it. He further opined that failure of the 
	government to identify and punish the criminals involved in similar other 
	incidents has encouraged the criminals and terrorists to continue the crimes 
	of such nature. The High commissioner called upon the government to do 
	something more effective, otherwise the democracy of the country would face 
	challenge from the terrorists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Awami league and other 14 parties 
	called a 3-day Hartal from 29-31 January. AL chief Sheikh Hasina 
	categorically held the ruling government for killing of erstwhile finance 
	minister. She further charged that government with its 4-party alliance 
	according its blue print is engaged to eliminate AL from political field. As 
	a part of it the 4-party alliance are eliminating the brilliant and popular 
	AL leaders. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Reaction of Government spokesmen:
	</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The PM Begum Khaleda, I hate to 
	utter this name, as usual with a mischievous voice and tone, in a routine 
	type reaction said, ‘This kind of incident is being done to defame the 
	country and aimed at to destroy the good name the government. This is a 
	result of deep conspiracy.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another government mouthpiece, the 
	secretary general and LGDR minister Mr. Mannan Bhuiyan said that, “the law 
	and order situation is much better now, why the government would do such 
	things to defame ourselves. We are an elected government. Yes, we have yet 
	to find the culprits responsible for earlier terrorist activities- this is 
	an administrative failure. That is why we are calling every body, meaning 
	the oppositions, come forward, let us work together to trace out those 
	culprits.” He further informed that an enquiry committee consisting of 
	different organizations of intelligence branch including DFI, SB, Police and 
	RAB under a DIG officer. This officer in a press interview said, “we have 
	formed a committee which is investigating the incident. We the officers will 
	supervise their work.' How foolish is this gentlemen. The DIG Sylhet in an 
	interview commented that the grenade thrown at the AL meeting said that the 
	device is a grenade named ‘Arches 75 or 84’. The public however has very 
	little interest of the investigating team or have any confidence in it, and 
	rightly so. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From the reaction of government it 
	is quite clear that Kibria killing is nor a significant event so far they 
	are concerned. They are more concerned over SAARC conference rather than 
	making full proof security to public leaders. Look at the comment of our 
	great three piece suited speaker, ‘if any MP asks for his security I inform 
	the matter to home ministry.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me finish this small write-up by 
	paying deep respect to this soft-spoken learned man who was academically 4 
	years senior to me. Off late we came very close to each other on many a 
	seminars and discussion meetings. He has a literary mind too. He was the 
	editor of a weakly magazine ‘Mridubhasan’. Apart from his political 
	activities as a top AL leader, he was also associated with many other 
	academic activities including column writings in many popular dailies. He 
	was the chairman of the ‘Bangladesh Foundation for Development Research’, an 
	organization devoted to academic studies and analyses of political, cultural 
	and social problems of our country. He was supposed to present a paper 
	entitled, “Tatwabadhayak Sarkar : Sanskar Prasanga” (Caretaker Government: 
	proposed modification)on 31st January in which I was also supposed to take 
	part as a discussant. But this was not to be. Kibria breathed his last !
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Who is responsible for these 
	terrifying killings? Neither the LGDR minister nor our half-educated of low 
	IQ great lady assuming PM’s office, who is more a fit in fashion a parade 
	took the responsibility or admitted their government’s utter failure to 
	combat terrorist activities or to unearth the miseries of these killings in 
	public meetings. Just within a span of few months in Sylhet alone three 
	major terrorist activities took place: Bomb blasting in Suranjit Sengupra’s 
	public meeting, (2) Bomb blast aiming at local AL leader Kamran, and (3) 
	attempt to kill British HC at Shahjalal Majar. The government has utterly 
	failed to protect the life of common as well as elites of our society with 
	its powerful various branches of law enforcing agencies like police, Ansar, 
	BDR, army and many special bahinis like RAB. The Khaleda led government must 
	answer to it. Otherwise public will held responsible Begum Khaleda and she 
	must quite the office admitting her failure. Democracy demands it because, 
	this is what is democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And to uphold the spirit of 
	democracy Shah A M S Kibria gave his life, because the fundamentalists and 
	communalists in him found the real challenge against them. Let me pay my 
	heartiest tribute to this fighter of liberal democracy and secularism 
	against communalism and fundamentalism.</font></p>
