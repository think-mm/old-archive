  <p class="Black9Text"><b>Story of Daughter in Law &amp; Mother in Law</b> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">We then moved to Luxmi's cottage. Luxmi Das, aged about 
  40 years, wife of Sudarsan Das is yet another unfortunate victim of gang rape. 
  Ramani and Luxmi both are day laborer (Kamla) having a son and daughter in 
  law. Our female team-member talked to them inside a room. A terrible inhuman 
  story of sexual violence was unfolded. According Luxmi both she, and her 16 
  year old and 4-5 month conceived daughter in law were subjected to gang rape 
  by at least 7 hooligans. <img src="bhola_luxmi.jpg" align="right" border="2" width="253" height="169">As 
  they heard that there might be some trouble following election the couple with 
  their son and daughter in law took shelter at the House Complex of Tarani 
  Kanti Das in the evening of 1st October. At about 4 a.m., 2nd October, the 
  complex was under attack by an armed group consisting of 20-25. According to 
  Luxmi what happened next, let us hear from her own language, &quot;.... They then 
  grabbed both of us - me and my daughter in law, and forcibly dragged to a near 
  by deserted house. Later on we learnt that the house belongs the ex-union 
  chairman, a local AL leader, Abdul Kader, who himself fled away for fear of 
  repression by their anti party supporters. The seven gangsters dragged my 
  daughter in law in the kitchen and looted her nakfu, and then they did the 
  same thing to me. We begged to them not to loot our honour (izzat) on the 
  ground that I am an old woman and my daughter in law is carrying for 3-4 
  months. The demons did not listen to us. &quot;<br>
  <b><i>Photo: Susmita with her mother in law Luxmi Devi. I dob't know how to 
  describe their plight. Both lost their nakfuls on the dreadful night of Oct' 
  2. Susmita was then carrying for 3-4 month. She has become so dumb since then. 
  Her mother in law tried her best to save the girl, but in doing so she herself 
  also became the victim.</i></b> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">Her daughter in law became so week after this gang rape 
  that she had to help her walking after two hours. They were not only robbed of 
  their highest and purest honour, their small material belongings were also 
  looted e.g. ducks 14, hens 2 with a dozen of eggs, dried chilies, rice (4 mond), 
  utensils and clothing from their house. Both Luxmi and her daughter in law 
  were treated in Lalmohan health complex. A case was filed in the name of 
  daughter in law at Lamoham Ps on 16. 11. 01 under an act of women and children 
  repression. We learnt that two accused were arrested. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text"><b>Story of Vendor Bari</b> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">Vendor Bari: A Place of horror &amp; Agony. (see map). A 
  very reputed house complex in this locality. The complex is also known as 
  Mistry Bari. 20-25 families live in here forming a cluster of families.
  <img src="bhola_vendorbari1.jpg" align="right" border="2" width="300" height="226"> This cluster is 
  known as Vendor. A few generation back head of a family was a Vendor doing 
  registration work involved in buying-selling deeds in a register office at 
  Lalmohan thana. Since the his house is to be called as Vandarer Bar (Vendor ' 
  House). Now the entire complex is known by that name. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text"><b><i>Photo: Learned professor of our team solacing the 
  wretched girl Susmita.</i></b><br>
  <br>
  As the Sun getting down into western horizon our team rushed to well known 
  spot called Vendor Bari- big house complex now headed by Nagendra Babu. He 
  received us with all sincerity and cordiality. In cracking voice he narrated 
  the horrible experiences he went through at the age of 76. He felt ashamed 
  that hundreds of girls and men took shelter in his house but could not protect 
  them from humiliation and sexual torture on the women.
  <img src="bhola_vendorbari2.jpg" align="left" border="2" width="198" height="207"><br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Photo: An elderly lady over 55, a victim physical &amp; sexual torture at 
  Vendar Bari complex.</i></b><br>
  <br>
  The terrorists more than one hundred divided into few groups attacked the 
  complex at about 9 p.m. and conducted their atrocious assaults waves after 
  waves throughout the night. On the following morning Nagendra Babu returned to 
  the complex and saw the devastation. Durbala Das, wife of Nagendra Babu gave 
  vivid description of what happened in that terrible night.
  <img src="bhola_vendorbari3.jpg" align="right" border="2" width="240" height="190"> All valuables from 
  all most all houses including cash money, ornaments, TV sets, agricultural 
  products like betel-nuts, Rice, dals etc. Kaccha houses were damaged, 
  betel-leaf shed destroyed. Women were sexually assaulted; their men 
  counterparts were physically manhandled, beaten, severely injured. The women 
  tried to save their life and honour to by hiding themselves in betel-leaf 
  sheds, paddy fields, even submerging themselves in knee deep water in the 
  field. But no natural barrier proved too difficult for the hooligans. Girls 
  were gang raped wherever found. No family poor or well to do could escape from 
  their torture. What a pity. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text"><b><i>Photo: Our learned Professor talking to Head of 
  the , now famous Vendar bari complex.</i></b><br>
  <br>
  Nagendra Babu, another respected and well to do gentleman of the locality. 
  This old man of age 75 does not what is his offence. Why he should be 
  humiliated, tortured and insulted by the youngsters of his own locality. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text"><b>Story of Vendor Bari Continued</b> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">
  <img src="bhola_vendorbari4.jpg" align="left" border="2" width="300" height="202"><br>
  <b><i>Photo: A female member of our team listening to a group of victims at 
  Vendar Bari Complex</i></b> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">One elderly women told our learned professor that a 
  married woman named Chhaya was first gang raped at Vendor Bari in the dark 
  night. On the following morning she came back to her own home thinking worst 
  is over. But alas the goondas attacked her again on following morning at about 
  10 a.m. (3rd October). She jumped into a pond for safety. But the hooligans 
  had better technique- as they grabbed the little child of Chhaya from inside a 
  room and threatened to throw the baby into pond if she didn't surrender to 
  their demand. The poor girl finding no alternative surrendered to their demand 
  and lost her nakful (symbol of izzat) second time to a group of gangsters.
  <img src="bhola_vendorbari5.jpg" align="right" border="2" width="177" height="226"> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">Another married girl, Anuradha wife of Krisna Kanta Das, 
  according to another elderly lady, was gang raped in the same night by a group 
  of unknown hooligans. She tried to defend her with a wooden stick (chala khat) 
  but being overpowered by the evil force she surrendered to her fate. Her 
  daughter in law, Trisna aged about 13-14 age was also subjected to sexual 
  violence under a shed of betel-leaf by a group of five monsters.<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Photo: Yet another unfortunate victim at Vendar Bari who lost her Nakful.</i></b>
  </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">An elderly gentleman told us that it is now difficult to 
  reside in this locality with honour and dignity. If grand old man Brojaraj, 
  Nagendra Babu, and men like Ganesh Kabiraj and Daktar Paban Babu, or school 
  teacher Shital Babu could be treated like dogs and cats than what is waiting 
  for common men is any body's guess. We are told many respected families either 
  left the village temporarily to near by safer places; some have taken shelter 
  in upazila sadar(s), some in Zila sadar. We are further informed that many 
  families have already left their homes permanently for West Bengal. Many 
  families are waiting for opportune time to leave the country. In all three 
  case instances are many.
  <img src="bhola_vendorbari6.jpg" align="left" border="2" width="200" height="286"> For example, 
  according to the story prevailing in the village respected Ganesh Babu left 
  the village as female members of his family were sexually tortured about a 
  week before the election.<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Photo: A gentleman of Annada Prasad , talking to one of our team mate, 
  who not only lost his property, but his pride and dignity too.</i></b><br>
  <br>
  The victims include his wife, his daughter and wife of his brother in law. His 
  residence was ransacked and valuable properties looted. We could not ascertain 
  the facts, as he was not available. An old gentleman whispered to me that he 
  is now living at upazila head quarter of Charfason across the mighty river 
  Meghna. A more harrowing story of sexual torture took place at the house of 
  Paban daktar, a well-respected gentleman of the locality and a reputed village 
  physician. He not only lost material properties, many female members of his 
  house lost their izzat (honour) including his wife, mother (50), and wife of 
  his brother in law Atul Chandra. The gentleman, for obvious reason does not 
  want to disclose the event publicly. We respected their sentiments. Another 
  heart bearing event, narrated by the same old man, involved the family of Hiru 
  Das whose wife was sexually violated by 3-4 goondas on the night of October 2, 
  in presence of him and his two sons. They failed to protect the unfortunate 
  lady. In shear shame and anguish the family left the village for unknown 
  destination. Many believe the family has taken shelter in West Bengal. When I 
  asked some one in the gathering if any Hindu gentleman has been tortured 
  because of his known political association with AL. We are told that most of 
  the Hindu villagers are simple and apolitical. One such victim is Banamali Das, 
  who is an AL worker. For this reason Banamali Das did not dare to come to the 
  village after election. During his absence his sister in law Parul Bala Das 
  sexually tortured and her nakful (izzat i.e. honour) was looted. When our 
  learned professor asked one respected old man, named Bijoy Kumar Das (74) what 
  to do about this migration of the people to an unknown country leaving behind 
  their lands, homes, and properties, he said in a melancholy tone &quot;sir what 
  else we can do? We have asked for protection, prayed for legal actin and fair 
  judgement - we did not get. Whom should we appeal or where should we pray for 
  justice? Our daughters, sisters, mothers &amp; wives have been violated to the 
  extreme by the gangsters again and again. Why should we stay here? Every body 
  will point to my mother, my sister, my wife, my daughter in law- look here 
  that lady was molested! Sir under this circumstances can we live in this 
  society with our backbone straight? It is therefore better for us if we leave 
  for an unknown country where no body will point a finger like this to my 
  family. &quot; 'Isn't a better solution sir?'- He asked. Our professor has no 
  answer nor do I have any. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">A general sense of insecurity, a sense of panic, a sense 
  of uneasiness is still prevailing throughout the Annada Prasd and adjacent 
  villages. The villagers do not dare to send their children, sons or daughters 
  to school. One such student talked to us- who is student of class IX at Lord 
  Hardinge High School. He is not attending school for fear of repression. 
  Another such example is Alta Bala, daughter of Monoranjan Das, a student of 
  class V of GM Primary School who stopped going school since 2nd October. We 
  learnt that she has been sent to West Bengal recently for safety. The families 
  who are contemplating to leave the country after selling their lands and other 
  properties are also in a dilemma as the market price of land at Lord Hardinge 
  getting down rapidly. Usual price of land in this locality is ~ Tk. 80,000/ 
  per Kani (two and half acre). Now it has come down to only Tk 20-25, 000/-.
  <img src="bhola_vendorbari7.jpg" align="right" border="2" width="269" height="142"> The sellers are not 
  certain even this money they will get after the deal is made. Our learned 
  professor talked to a group of young men, who as told by the villagers belong 
  to the gangsters; they said &quot; not much had happened, the reporters made it 
  exaggerated. Now total peace is prevailing, Sir. &quot; Their ring leaders Yasin 
  Master and Abul Kasem also were of the same opinion. When asked being an 
  influential &amp; a good man, as you claimed, why didn't you take appropriate 
  action to protect the poor minorities? He gave answer with a characteristic 
  mischievous smile &quot; Texan Quiche Ah Naito Sir, - Polapanera dui ekta ita 
  marchhe &quot;Malign glare &quot; [ Sir, nothing serious happened here; some boys threw 
  brick-bats, one or two to the houses of non Muslims (Malauns).&quot;<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Photo: A group of gangsters and their ring leader.</i></b><br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="Black9Text">We came to know that 35 families are ready to leave the 
  country with the arrangement of local brokers (dalas) very soon. The matter is 
  quite well known. We learnt that already the family of Haralal Das with his 
  wife and a daughter, Liton and his wife (son of Kamini Dhobi), Satyabati and 
  her two daughters (her husband left a month ago) and many others have left the 
  village for West Bengal in India. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">We later learnt that after our return from Annada Prasad 
  the gangsters once again threatened the villagers if they say anything against 
  them, they will be simply eliminated this time, - no body could save them. 
  Momata's father was taken to the Lalmohan police station by the local BNP 
  leaders and tried to induce him withdraw the case of rape. Fortunately the 
  courageous Father did not yield to their pressure. But how long he can resist? 
  A group Bedes, nomadic people used live on boat and move about from one 
  village to another along the riverside, temporarily anchored at the Batai 
  Canal, near Fatemabad sluice gate. When a group of Bede girls were moving 
  around the village, we learnt that on 5th January, two goondas belonging to 
  the group of gangsters, named Alamgeer (a ring leader &amp; accused of almost all 
  cases filed so far) and Nantu manged to isolate one young girl on some plea &amp; 
  took her to the quarter of one Tajel Bapari, father in law of Nantu. Then 
  those two notorious young men stripped of the girl &amp; molested her. She was 
  however saved by the neighbors and recovered her naked. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">We note down as many names as we could who were sexually 
  tortured from different elderly women. The general remark is that whether one 
  admits or not now, it is difficult to find any young and mid-aged women who 
  could save their nakfuls on that dreadful night of 2nd October. Only God knows 
  with HIS omnipresence knowledge. The powerless GOD looked so helpless against 
  a one hundred strong miscreants on that dreadful night of October 2.. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">
  <img src="bhola_vendorbari7.gif" align="left" border="2" width="250" height="175"> God fathers are more 
  powerful than God himself. What a pity!<br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Photo: The God Father &quot;Yasin Master&quot;</i></b><br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="Black9Text">When the team was returning from 'Vendor Bari' it is 
  already dark say about 6 p.m. many people were found to line up on both sides 
  of the earthen road every one eager to talk to us hoping that these 
  sympathetic 'Bara Sahibs' might do some thing good to them. Our learned 
  Professor on his way tried to solace them and talking as many as possible as 
  we were waiting for him on our microbus. One girl narrated her story in a 
  whispering voice with tears in her eyes that two gangster looted her nakful (izzat 
  i.e. honour). She was narrating her story to our elderly gray harried 
  professor, as if a daughter is telling to her father the story of her loosing 
  the greatest wealth. Her name is Golapi. I found her as pure as her name 
  indicates. The crowd, Brajokumar babu, Nagen Babu, day laborer Sudha Mohan). a 
  grand old lady of 104 years all repeatedly requested us to visit them again 
  and again; they also appealed to us to take up the matter with the 'oparwalla' 
  (not God) so that the local Police Substation (Phanri) be retained and police 
  patrolling is strengthened. We left them to their fate knowing fully well how 
  helpless they are, and so we are. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">On our way back we dropped at the Lalmohan Police 
  Station at about 7-30 p.m. The duty officer, in the absence of O.C. gave the 
  details of the progress of the cases and assured us that they were doing their 
  best. He further assured us that the local police substation would remain 
  there for indefinite period. On the next morning at about 11 a.m. we met the 
  Deputy Commissioner (DC) and gave him a memorandum narrating our experience. 
  We further asked him to initiate more cases on their own so that common people 
  in the locality feel assured and revise their decision not to leave the 
  county. The DC, a perfect gentleman, assured us with a smile. We left Bhola in 
  the evening of 29th December after visiting some other affected areas in Uttar 
  Dighaldee union under Bhola Sadar. The story is same, pattern is identical. 
  One may legitimately ask is it a pre-planned scheme? Honestly speaking I don't 
  know. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text"><u>Epilogue</u> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text">Our Bhola contact recently informed us (11th January) 
  that after our return from Annada Prasad the gangsters once again threatened 
  the villagers if they say anything against them any more to outsiders, they 
  would be simply eliminated this time, - no body could save them. Momata's 
  father was taken to the Lalmohan police station by the local BNP leaders and 
  tried to induce him to withdraw the case of rape. Fortunately the courageous 
  father did not yield to their pressure. But how long he can resist? A group of 
  Bedes, nomadic people used live on boat and move about from one village to 
  another along the riverside, temporarily anchored at the Batai Canal, near 
  Fatemabad sluice gate. When a group of Bede girls were moving around the 
  village, we learnt that on 5th January, two goondas belonging to the group of 
  gangsters, named Alamgeer (a ring leader &amp; accused of almost all cases filed 
  so far) and Nantu managed to isolate one young girl on some plea &amp; took her to 
  the quarter of one Tajel Bapari, father in law of Nantu. Then those two 
  notorious young men stripped of the girl &amp; molested her. She was however saved 
  by the neighbors and recovered her naked. There was an amicable settlement- 
  the two goondas were fined Tk 1500/- for the offence they committed. There was 
  no police case. The local administration did not take the matter seriously. In 
  every notorious case the accused are set free- and they every time show thumb 
  to the complainants and the police administration. They could continue their 
  notorious anti-social &amp; criminal offence unabated because of the political 
  support they are receiving from the party in power. In the mean while the 
  plight of minorities and weaker section of the society continues and &quot;Vicharer 
  Vani Nirabe Nivrite Kande &quot;. </p>
