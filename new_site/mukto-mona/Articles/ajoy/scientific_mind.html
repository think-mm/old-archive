  Science </span></font></p>
  </font></b><font face="Verdana">
  <p align="justify">Now a days we talk much of scientific mind or science 
  oriented thought. In BTV for a long time in a particular program the comparer 
  in his introductory remarks uttered with all sincerity that object of his 
  program is to help building a society based on scientific mind and deep 
  religious devotion. No doubt it is a noble object indeed. Our political 
  leaders also in a proverbial style every day advising us to be scientifically 
  minded and they promising us to present a society based on scientific thought 
  and culture. We want scientifically oriented society, we want science based 
  freethinking, we want to solve every problem that confronted us to day in a 
  scientific path - whatever the nature of the problem, be it economical or 
  social. </p>
  <p align="justify">But by uttering those words like 'Scientific Mind', 
  'Scientific Conscience', or 'Scientific Path'- what really want to mean, - our 
  advisers don't make these terms intelligible to us - the ordinary people, they 
  don't make the ideas clear or try to elaborate. We do not realize what would 
  be the nature of the 'scientifically oriented society? Nor do we have any idea 
  how to solve a problem in scientific way? All these words remain vague to us.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">Do we know truly what is the nature of way that we would 
  call really 'Scientific'? Are we exposed to such training in our life, in our 
  educational system, in our curriculum, the way we would proceed that might be 
  called scientifically valid? Are these methods are reflected in syllabus and 
  curriculum of school and college education? We can very rightly raise these 
  questions to ourselves and to our advisers. </p>
  <p align="justify">The root meaning of the Bengali term 'Biggan' is '<i>Specialized 
  Knowledge</i>'. But whatever the root meaning of the term might have in the 
  past, we adopted this word to carry the meaning and significance of the 
  English word '<i>Science</i>'. And Science, according the concept that 
  developed by the scientists, is a path- a way and a process through which we 
  acquire knowledge, we create knowledge and ultimately the path leads us to 
  discover truth. The basis of Science is logic, logical freethinking, and 
  independent observations and information dependent analysis. Thus, the maker 
  of science oriented society must cultivate science. </p>
  <p>Cultivation of science has two aspects; we generally do not keep it in 
  mind. We are however very much conscious of its application aspect, because 
  that aspect has considerably influenced our material world, that has brought 
  us comfort. Its other aspect is its inherent Philosophy that helps us make our 
  thought and conscience clear and transparent, our vision becomes logic based, 
  as transparent and clear as Mathematics. But most of the time about this 
  aspect of science that its inherent philosophy. Many think that science is 
  capable of delivering perfect knowledge. This is however, in some sense not 
  entirely correct. Because, there is no end of knowledge; Cultivation of 
  science helps expanding our horizon of knowledge, lifts us from one stage to 
  upper stage - and the process continues. The gist of scientific methodology 
  is: From observation or from theory assumptions or hypotheses are made, and 
  each hypothesis is verified through observation or tested in a laboratory. 
  After reaching a conclusion about the result of test or experimentation it 
  could be decided whether the hypothesis got support or found invalid. Then the 
  experimental data collected for first hypothesis could be utilized to make new 
  hypothesis, - and these new hypotheses produce answers to our queries and with 
  them, some new questions too. That means more we know more we become aware 
  what we don't know. If we understand that perfect knowledge means that we know 
  all probable aspects of an event or a thing, then the above mentioned 
  scientific methodology would not lead to us to success.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="justify">This way fruits of scientific creativity and solution of a 
  problem may as inviting new problem. When we attempt to solve social problems 
  that have arisen from technological development by applying science we must 
  remember those probabilities. </p>
  <p align="justify">In the backdrop of attempting to build a science oriented 
  society we must also remember another aspect of our social life. Man has 
  suddenly appeared before a door of all probable- and that has been achieved 
  through research and cultivation of science and science only. We have 
  witnessed in our own generation how much power man has acquired. Man has 
  opened&nbsp; up immense source of energy by splitting atoms. Man's analytical mind, 
  its capability of tackling any complicated mathematical problem, its 
  capability of taking near correct decision and projecting future reached an 
  infinite stage of development through the application of computer and 
  information technology. In the discipline of genetics, and fortunately with 
  the application of molecular biology man has reached a stage from where he can 
  think of controlling his own life. Technology is a discipline by which we 
  could use our knowledge for our material life. By following this path man has 
  century after century slowly but steadily began to conquer its environment and 
  gradually mastering over it. At the same time man has developed its mental 
  faculty and expanded its horizon of thought. </p>
  <p align="justify">Technology is the practical application of knowledge, on 
  the other hand 'thought and conscience', 'concept and ideas' of science are 
  closely linked with knowledge. Of course many of suffer from confusion or 
  haziness regarding these two terms. From this sense of confusion we think 
  science is different from our way of life, - we only want to enjoy the fruits 
  of science, but try to abandon its knowledge-processing path from our social 
  life. </p>
  <p align="justify">From ultimate analysis- man has emerged from matter. He has 
  now begun to 'understand' and 'know' his environment, and at the same time he 
  now recognizes the form of powerful factors that controls the environment. He 
  has also now begun to understand the process of life. Man's greatest peak of 
  success is his knowledge and acquiring the scientific methodology of acquiring 
  and expanding the horizon of knowledge. Knowledge ensures freedom of man, 
  whereas ignorance confined him within walls, and may be captive of a network 
  of superstitious and blind faith. In the path of acquiring fundamental 
  knowledge progress of science could not be stopped, and it should not be. </p>
  <p align="justify">We can here, pose a question. Do science has a 
  philosophical basis. </font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000ff">In order to 
  discover or know something does science follow a 'unique' path?</font><font face="Verdana"> 
  Can Science produce perfect or absolute knowledge about something? The essence 
  of view of the materialist philosophers (e.g. Frederick Herbert) in this 
  regard is: '<i>Perception</i>' is the basis of our knowledge,- all 
  philosophical problems could be solved by analysis of information and events 
  received through perception. But the real knowledge is obtainable by the 
  application of perception and intelligence. Schoepenhouer assumed that 
  knowledge is of course perceptible. Information and facts received through 
  senses are the basis of knowledge. Now let us see how or following what path 
  science attempts to reach truth or acquire knowledge. </font></p>
  <font face="Verdana">
  <p align="justify">The objective of Natural Science (not Bio Science), more 
  particularly Physics is to discover those similar laws, general principles and 
  fundamental laws that govern the mother 'Nature'. Science looks upon knowledge 
  as attributes emanating from so called perception or experimentally facts. 
  Thus first stage of scientific methodology is to start enquiry and observation 
  for collection of facts- then critical analysis of those facts to reach a 
  generalization. Analysis of these facts using mathematical and other 
  analytical methods, application of intelligence may lead to discover a natural 
  law. At the third stage the scientists may attempt to formulate some special 
  law(s) through logical approach, which must be subject to observation or 
  experiment for its validity. Next, with the help of these special laws it is 
  possible to explain different natural phenomena and with these some general 
  laws are added. This methodology is obviously 'Inductive'. Establishment of 
  four fundamental equations of electromagnetic fields by Maxwell is an 
  excellent example of this approach. Side by side science does also adopt 
  deductive system of reaching truth with equally effectiveness, a method very 
  much liked by the philosophers. From this point of view it is possible to 
  raise science from the empirical state to a state of a state of mathematical 
  logic, of course with the application of intelligence and merit nourished by 
  perception and experience. The scientist, be guided by perception and 
  experience or inspired by intuitive guidance, builds a mathematical model 
  having causal relation with the outside world of the phenomenon he wants to 
  explain. In his model find place some mathematical symbols and terms chosen 
  through critical analysis using deductive method. </p>
  <p align="justify">This deductive system of reaching acquiring knowledge was 
  adopted by Newton and also Einstein. The theory of relativity, particularly, 
  the general theory after being rectified through perception of physics 
  developed from mathematical model. Einstein viewed that no construct of a 
  Physical System could arise from date obtained from mere perception or from 
  experiment(s). The main principle behind this is &quot;free invention of human 
  intellectual power&quot;. The perception may help one to obtain suitable 
  mathematical ides, but those ideas never could be obtainable wholly. The 
  creative principle lies in mathematics. Great discoveries of science do not 
  follow from Beconian mechanical methodology. These were the believes of 
  Einstein. The Beconian method may produce Kepler, Rydberg but would fail to 
  produce Newton and Bohr, In plain language the definition of science is to 
  make a unison of disorder sensations received through our sense organs with a 
  logical unified thought process. Perception is received from outside, but 
  attempt to understand these through a theory are the invention of the human 
  intellect. The revelation of physical event and attempt to give logical 
  explanation give birth of a theory. But if the theory is not verified by 
  experiment or it fails to predict future event- it is not beyond question. In 
  that case a new theory may replace the existing one. This is the path of 
  Science, -it does not give absolute knowledge about something. Acquirement of 
  'absolute knowledge' is impossible. This is yet another </font>
  <font face="Arial"><font face="Verdana" color="#0000ff"><i>principle of 
  impossibility</i></font><font face="Verdana"> of science. With this we, must 
  remember applicability is the most important criterion in judging science. We 
  have already stated that technology is the tools of using knowledge that 
  emanates from scientific investigation. Science must have its application in 
  our social and practical life. We must also emphasize that fundamental laws 
  can never be evolved from logical arguments or from mathematical constructs. 
  The fundamental natural laws are the extracts of our knowledge- the generalize 
  form of the knowledge. The fundamental natural laws are to be invented; they 
  have to be brought to our realization. This is done by the scientists whether 
  he follows deductive or inductive system; The disciplined thought and creative 
  feeling with the help of which a genius scientist discovers law of nature must 
  be of very interesting nature for discussion.</p>
  <p align="justify">Another question is often raised - is there any place of 
  'Intuition' in science? If intuition is treated as </font><font face="Arial">
  <font face="Verdana" color="#0000ff"><i>inspired assumption or conception</i></font><font face="Verdana"> 
  then it has. But there exists a strong scientific as well as social background 
  behind each inspired assumption i.e. intuition. The development of human 
  intellect has reached such a stage that if an appropriate background is 
  available the inspired assumption is generated spontaneously. 'Constancy of 
  velocity of light', and 'principle of equivalence' due to Einstein; 'Existence 
  of quantum states of radiating atomic oscillators' due to Plank; 'Concept of 
  matter waves' due to de Broglie are few examples of intuition. Invention of 
  statistics describing the behavior of quantum particle before the discovery of 
  Quantum Mechanics by S. N. Bose of Dhaka University in 1924 is the result 
  Bose's inspired assumption(s). </p>
  <p align="justify">Another principle of 'The theory of knowledge' of science 
  or of Physics is to understand and explain the phenomena of nature with 
  minimum possible number of laws of nature. The leaders of this concept are 
  Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and in our time Salam-Weinberg-Glashow, and 
  Hawking. &quot;The world phenomena from the moment of birth of the universe to its 
  end&quot; could be explained by a single unified theory is dream of all these 
  greats. </p>

  <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff"><b>2. A society without reason and 
  logic</b></span></font>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">From the above short discussion it follows that for 
  building a Science oriented and free thinking society our path of cultivation 
  of knowledge would have to be logical and inquisitive conscience-thought 
  dependent. In the field of knowledge we can not progress in the absence of 
  cultivation of freethinking if such atmosphere is wanted the society becomes 
  backward and superstitious. Many a centuries back Ibne Rushd was the pioneer 
  to show this path of cultivation of knowledge. Perhaps he was the Philosopher 
  of Islamic world who devoted himself in search of knowledge with free mind and 
  thinking. According to his concept of path of knowledge 'only from philosophy 
  knowledge emanates'. For this very reason he tried to separate religion in the 
  cultivation of science and philosophy. He did not hesitate to indicate that in 
  the path of acquiring knowledge the principal hindrance is '</font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000ff"><i>the 
  blind religious faith' </i></font><font face="Arial"></p>
  <font face="Verdana">
  <p align="justify">The religious feeling covered with superstition negates the 
  independence thinking and progress of man. As a result not only in thinking, 
  even in the field of technology and theoretical study men become captive 
  within a narrow world. The main extraction of human mind that pushes him to 
  progress is his logical capability and power The clear basis of logic makes a 
  man 'man' . When man gives more importance to logic and reason in place of 
  blind faith, then he becomes 'religious' in the real sense- his religion then 
  springs from reason and logic. To ask man not to question, or to induce him to 
  become faithful is an attempt to bring him down to a state of a beast.</p>
  <p align="justify">The religionists are therefore very much afraid of logic 
  and reason. Because the expansion of thinking process based on reason is 
  helpful way of acquiring knowledge. When man acquires this ability of thinking 
  he is no more afraid of supernatural power and does believe in supernatural 
  events. He then tries to explore a cause behind every event, and finds a logic 
  and reason dependent explanation. Even humanist like Martin Luther, a deeply 
  religious man was afraid of reason and logic, when he says</p>
  <p align="justify">&quot; And what saith God? Impossible things, lies, foolish, 
  weak, absurd, abominable. heretical, and devilish things, if we believe 
  reason. So, if you follow the judgment of reason, God setteth forth absurd and

  <p align="justify">But the rationalist philosopher who through cultivation of 
  philosophy tried to establish knowledge and truth, long long before Galleleo, 
  he had to suffer for his liberal thought and cultivation of free thinking, was 
  banished from his native land, and in the name of justice he was forced to 
  pronounce '</font><font face="Arial"><font face="Verdana" color="#0000ff"><i>Towba'</i></font><font face="Verdana"> 
  . Off late attempt has been to depict him a true Muslim. On the contrary Ibne 
  Rushd was non-believer of conventional religion. The secular Arabian 
  Philosophy infested with freethinking was flourished at the hands of genius 
  like Al Farazi and Ibne Sinah, later time because of the overwhelming 
  influence of Imam Gazzali his secular philosophy almost extinguished from the 
  Arab and Islamic world. However late on, Ibne Rush made a desperate attempt to 
  revive this school freethinking based secular philosophy. As a matter of fact 
  the impact Imam Gazalli totally banished any philosophy or opinions devoid of 
  God from the entire Islamic world. Another secular philosopher-thinker as well 
  as an astronomer and a great poet of Islamic world was Omar Khaiyam. His 
  contribution in geometry and algebra is also quite note worthy. He has 
  cultivated freethinking throughout his life. In him we find expression of his 
  dependence on logic and reason. Essence of his philosophy has been beautifully 
  found repression in an Arabic poem. The poem reads: </p>

  <p align="justify">Omar composed this poem long long time back, but it appears

  <p align="justify"><b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff">
  <font color="#000080">3. Our position and Progress of Science</font></span></p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify"><b>If the holy books are the only source of knowledge, then 
  stagnation will result in the society, the society would turn into a static 
  state in its conscience and thinking, creativity would be replaced by 
  superstition, unproductiveness, narrow-looking attitude, illiteracy and 
  foolishness</b>. That type of society would be retrogressive and backward 
  looking. What we see in our society? Superstition and fruits of technology 
  mutually co-exist. We don't want the reason of science; we want only its 
  fruits in our material life; side by side we will nourish blind faith and 
  submission to fate. We decorate our drawing with a coloured TV and watch 
  satellite program, send our hysterical daughter to the abode of a peer instead 
  of taking to medical centre.- this kind of contradiction is possible only in 
  our society. In this society it is possible for a microbiologist to carry on 
  higher research biochemistry , at the same time kissing the feet of a famous 
  peer. It is in our society possible for a learned political scientist to a 
  research monograph on secular political system at the same time to rush to a 
  half educated spiritual peer for begging his blessings to have a lucrative 
  coveted post of administration. This is the typical panoramic view of our 
  society we are used to see. On the one hand meritorious bright students are 
  nourishing logically unsound old religious ideas and values on the other hand 
  they are found studying Medical science and Science of technology and 
  engineering. Do they suffer from any contradiction ?</p>
  <p align="justify">On this two parallel life there exist no conflict, no 
  interaction. One is totally isolated from the other. Isn't strange. In our 
  society we find if a valuable thing is lost we rush to a mullah who could send 
  a container (bati-chalan) to catch the thief, instead of seeking the help of 
  police. It is not a strange phenomenon in our society when we see a professor 
  of physics delivering learned lecture on theory of gravitation is rushing to 
  his religious master (Gurudev) throwing himself on his feet as he sees his 
  gurudev is floating in space defying the law of gravitation or crossing the 
  mighty river Meghna walking with wooden sandal. I don't get surprise when a 
  smart professor of chemistry become famous writing novel on parapsychology.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">The parapsychologists in the name of science, and some 
  religious masters and believers incarnation and some persons know as peers in 
  the name of religion are out trying to preach that theology and 
  transcendentalism are scientific. The parapsychologists in the name of 
  following scientific path they are taking the fraudulent method and magic in 
  order to prove the existence of 'transcendental power', Planchet, rebirth, 
  telepathy etc. Most of the so-called holders of spiritual powers are found to 
  adopt these methods in order to influence their followers and common people. 
  Bat sad part of the story is <b>a significant section of educated class, some 
  intellectuals for their own interest or for other reason extends direct or 
  indirect supports to these frauds. </b></p>
  <p align="justify">But history teaches us that scientific thought has always 
  won the battle against the superstition, blind faith and conventional beliefs, 
  even when those people had suffered. Even under severe threats and repression 
  Ibn e Sinah, Ibn e Rushd and others like them did not surrender or gave up 
  their secular philosophical views. Zirham, Al Dimiski embraced death but did 
  not submit to the repression nor gave up their progressive logic and reason. 
  Even when identified as anti religionist or under severe repression at the 
  hands of the blind religionists the famous Medicinal Scientist and doctor 
  Muhammad Bin Zakaria Al Razi did not stop preaching his opinions of free 
  thinking and liberalism. </p>
  <p align="justify">For holding the view 'The earth and other planets are 
  moving around the sun' Italian scientist Giordano Bruno&nbsp; had to suffer 8-years 
  repressive imprisonment. Blind religionist and great Pope of that time got 
  annoyed with Bruno, but he did not abandoned what he had believed to be true. 
  Finally, in 1600 he was burnt to death for holding views contradicting those 
  of holy books. But truth prevailed. We all know the story of repression on 
  Galleleo by the Church- but still earth is revolving around the sun and not 
  the earth. More than 400 years before the birth of 'Son of God' Anaxogorus put 
  forward a scientific explanation of eclipse of moon stating that moon has no 
  light of its own. Light coming from the moon is the reflection of sunrays. For 
  preaching this anti religious view contradicting the holy book , the great 
  scientist had to undergo through severe repression and finally was banished 
  from his country. But the message of the holy book did not last, the truth of 
  science prevailed- the eclipse is not a supernatural phenomenon, -it is a 
  natural event. In 16<sup>th</sup> century, Paracelesus, Professor of chemistry 
  of Besel University, Switzerland prove through his research that cause of a 
  decease was due to existence of some kind of germ (bacteria, bacillus or 
  virus...). If these germs could be destroyed the decease is over. But the 
  Christian belief is that decease is the result of a sin. He was tried for 
  preaching a view that was not in conformity with that of the holy book . Hue 
  was given capital punishment, but the professor fled away saving his life. But 
  once again scientific truth prevailed. </p>
  <p align="justify">The Bioscience and the science dealing with creation of 
  life did not progresses as fast as other physical sciences in the last 
  century. That gave an opportunity to the Mullahs, Priests to preach the theory 
  of creation as stated in the holy books, and thereby they tried to influence 
  the common mass. The use make the common mass panic by raising the question of 
  Haven and hell, But in the event of unprecedented development in life science 
  the of creation as found in religious books are now meeting the challenge of 
  modern revelation of science. Even the common mass could keep faith on those 
  religious theories of creation.</p>
  <p align="justify">Acceding to classical Hindu-dharma Brahma is the god of 
  creation- from his different parts of body various forms of life sprang out . 
  Man is also a kind of being,. According to Christianity 'The Prime Father' 
  Zihoba is the creator of all creations. He created every beings in opposite 
  couples. In this very way one day Zihoba created first human couple: Adam and 
  Eve. And we are all descendents of Adam and Eve. </p>
  <p align="justify">But recent research and studies in BioSciences and Science 
  of creation has shaken our faith in the gospels of creation as stated in the 
  Holy Scriptures. <b>It is now gradually established that no living being after 
  being created by the Prime Father did appear on the surface of the earth 
  suddenly on one fine morning. Life has evolved on earth through long process 
  of evolution of millions of years. </b>Following this process of evolution 
  ultimately Homo sapiens i.e. intelligent man appeared on earth. </p>
  <p align="justify">Darwin was the first naturalist who proposed the scientific 
  history of evolution of animals. His years of investigation, analysis of 
  species and critical inference led his famous work 'The Origin of Species' . 
  By proposing his theory of creation of lives through the process of evolution 
  he practically demolished the stories of creation narrated in holy books. </p>
  <p align="justify">Discoveries of various types of fossils in recent times, 
  their microscopic analysis and determination of their antiquity the 
  Palaeontologists Palaeo-bioscientists and anthropologists thorough their 
  coordinated research and studies almost completed the most difficult task of 
  linking the 'missing link' of Darwin. Except the conservative religionists 
  every man with freethinking believes in the theory of evolution and man has 
  evolved through this process of evolution. Darwin himself in his time was 
  vehemently criticized, condemned for propagating his theory of evolution; he 
  was exposed to repression in the same style of mediaeval period from the 
  church. He had to tolerate many bitter and hated comments from important 
  persons of the society. For example, the Bishop Wilber commented was the grand 
  father of Darwin a monkey ? Some remarked Darwin himself looked like a monkey, 
  hence he propagated theory that stated man evolved from monkey. But it 
  appeared strange to me whereas Darwin and later on other naturalists and 
  Palaeo-bioscientists through their devotion and research established the 
  theory of evolution by analyzing and critical examining of large number of 
  specimens and fossils, but a gentlemen, known as poet, and happened to be a 
  national professor without reading or underrating a line of evolution theory 
  or even seeing a fossil in his life time.</p>
