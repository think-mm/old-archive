  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The unprecedented persecution, which 
  started on the minority and ethnic communities of Bangladesh since the four 
  party alliance led by BNP–Jamaat assumed power in October 1, 2001, is still 
  going on. Simultaneously the activities of various armed fundamentalist 
  organizations and their activities have been intensified. <br>
  <br>
  Recently we are observing in national dailies different dimensional news about 
  persecutions on the minorities. Mr. Shah Alam, Imam of local Ahmadya Mosque 
  and leader of Ahmadya Community of Raghunathpur Baag of Jhikargacha in the 
  district of Jessore, was brutally assassinated in broad day light with ‘lathi’ 
  and hockey sticks on October 31 (2003). Two more members of Ahmadya Community 
  were also injured in this attack. Fourteen families of Ahmadya Muslim 
  Community of Uttar Bhobanipur village of Bheramara in Kushtia district have 
  virtually been ostracized and confined in their own houses. According to 
  reports of the national dailies in this regard, local Jamaat-e-Islami leaders 
  are responsible for these atrocious incidents. Leaders of Ahmedya Jamaat also 
  accused Jamaat-e-Islami for these heinous incidents in Jhikargacha and 
  Bheramara. <br>
  <br>
  After reading the consecutive news of such of persecution in the newspapers we 
  have made a visit those troublesome areas of Jessore and Kushtia on 15 and 16 
  November. There were present Justice K.M. Sobhan, adviser of 1971 Ghatak Dalal 
  Nirmul Committee and a leader of Human Rights movement, was with me along with 
  other 10 central and district level leaders and the lawyers, journalists, 
  cultural and local human rights activists of Jessore and Kushtia. We have 
  spoken with the deceased Shah Alma’s wife Nazma, sons Mustafa and Kabir, 
  daughter Sathi, younger brother Yusuf Ali including both the members of 
  Ahmadya and Sunni Community of the village at Raghunathpur Bag. Similarly we 
  have a talk with the members of the persecuted families and the police 
  administration of Uttar Bhobanipur of Kushtia. Although police is staying in 
  the trouble area at the moment, none of the criminals who are responsible for 
  these incidents has been arrested so far.<br>
  Ten year old Sathi, daughter of assassinated Shah Alam of Raghunathpur bag, 
  witnessed the gruesome murder of her father. Even after 15 days of the event 
  she looked panicky and scared. While stating the event she cried and burst 
  into tears. Along with her mother and aunt, Sathi also tried to prevent the 
  killers to save her father but they did not bother of this obstruction. 
  Sathi’s mother Nazma (38) witnessed how her husband was killed with ‘lathi’ 
  and hockey sticks under the leadership of Aminur, who is a local Rokon (Senior 
  member of Jamaat-e-Islami) of Jamaat-e-Islami, a Madrasha teacher and Imam of 
  local mosque. When she herself wanted to take her dying husband to hospital in 
  a rickshaw van she was prevented by the killers. She filed a lawsuit against 
  Aminur including other 16 persons who are responsible Shah Alam murder. Police 
  has not yet arrested any of criminals. They are rather asking the relatives of 
  the deceased to capture those accused by themselves. The accused are 
  threatening Nazma, wife of deceased person that they would kill her and her 
  children if she dose not withdraw the lawsuit against them. <br>
  <br>
  After Friday prayer on October 31 accused Aminur instigate the musolli (people 
  who assemble in the mosque to offer prayer) by telling them that the 
  ‘Kadianees’ (Ahmedya) are ‘kafir’ (non-believer) and nothing will be happened 
  if they killed them. Local farmer Jamaluddin (35), who was present in the 
  mosque, stated that before they come out for killing Shah Alam, Aminur had 
  taken oath of the ‘musollis’ of the mosque. Aminur further declared that the 
  ‘Kadianees’ are Christians and they eat pork. Aminur also declared that if any 
  charge were filed against the killers he would sell his property to fight the 
  case in favour the accused. <br>
  <br>
  Delwar Hossain (24), one of accused of these incidents, a student of Islami 
  University, son of Nuru Munshi, described how Jamaat-e-Islami’s activist 
  Aminur had threatened the ‘mussllis’. He stated, on the day of the event 
  Aminur had declared in the mosque that ‘Jehad’ (War in the name of Islam) 
  would have to be launched against the ‘Kadianees’ and who would not go with 
  him to Shah Alam’s house, they will not be allowed in the mosque to offer 
  their prayer. Aminur’s companions caught the collar of Nuru Munshi’s Shirt and 
  dragged him. According to Delwar’s statement, Shah Alam had been killed before 
  Nuru Munshi reached the spot and his father Nuru Munshi get senseless to see 
  the dead body of the deceased. <br>
  <br>
  Members of deceased Shah Alam’s family and all other witnesses of the village 
  stated, Aminur and his gang went to Shah Alam’s house with bamboo and hockey 
  sticks only for killing him. After Jumma prayer armed Aminur accompanied by 
  more then one hundred people went to Shah Alam’s house and asked him if he 
  would give up Ahmadya creed and faith. On his denial they killed him. 
  Jamaat-e-Islami’s activists were threatening him since long to give up Ahmadya 
  creed and faith. <br>
  Although no one of the Ahmadya community of Uttor-Bhobanipur of Bheramara 
  upozilla in Kushtia has so far been killed but they threatened to be killed. 
  Saber Ali (36), a members of Ahmadya community said, Imam of local mosque and 
  worker of Jamaat-e-Islami Razzak Moulvi and his companions Mehrul, Palan, 
  Israfil, Majedul and others had threatened to slaughter the ‘Kadianees’ of 
  Uttar Bhobanipur after three days of Eid. Saber Ali and the ostracized and 
  confined members of the local Ahmadya community alleged that they ruined 
  Betel-leaf-ground of Ahmedyas and not even allowed to come out from their 
  houses. The local shopkeepers are also been threatened not to sell any goods 
  to the ‘Kadianees’. Anwara Khatun’s (32) husband Salimuddin is an Ahmedya. 
  Only on this ground she is being threatened that if she desired to remain 
  alive she must divorce her husband and made a confession of sin and begging 
  pardon of Allah. Anwara told them that she would not divorce her husband. 
  After this she was threatened to kill. Then she, with her husband and children 
  left their house and took shelter in their neighbour Saber Ali’s house in a 
  single cloth. <br>
  <br>
  Fourteen families of the Ahmadya Community of Uttar Bhobanipur have been 
  passing their days in an inhuman condition since the last 26 days. Because of 
  confinement at their house they cannot even harvest their paddy and other 
  crops from their field. Five days ago Saber Ali’s wife Minara Khatun (39) in 
  hide went to collect Bringal from her garden. At that time Mokhles, Meherul 
  and others abusing her with vulgar and indecent slang and snatched the 
  Brinjels from her garden. Dabir Ali’s wife Rashia Khatun (30) alleged that the 
  followers of local Jamaat-e-Islami brought out processions everyday in front 
  of the Ahmedya’s houses and throwing vulgar, indecent and offensive slang and 
  comment to the Ahmedya’s. Even they have made filthy and indecent slang and 
  comment about female members of Ahmedya’s community. <br>
  <br>
  Even the children of Ahmadya Muslim community of this village could not escape 
  this persecution. Shirin (14), Bilkis (13), Rubel (9) and Sohel (10) informed 
  us that Razzak Moulvi and his people had stopped them from going to their 
  schools. Some of them are studying in Govt. School, some of in BRAC School and 
  some of them studying in religious school. Everywhere situation is the same. 
  The teachers of Govt. School informed the guardians of the students that if 
  the Ahmedya students come to school for studying then other students would not 
  come there. Even the teachers of BRAC School informed us that other guardians 
  threatened them saying that they would not send their children if the 
  Kadianees’ children come to their school for studying. One teacher said, even 
  if any Kadianee girl comes to school to study they would set five boys upon 
  her for insulting. Harassed and humiliated Shirin and Bilkis told us with 
  tears that their annual examination will be held after Eid holiday but they 
  have been told not to appear in school annual examination. <br>
  <br>
  We went to Uttar Bhobanipur on 16 November (2003) and found that in the 
  previous night the miscreants had lifted and taken away tubewells of two 
  Ahmadya families. Salimuddin (40) reported that they could not cook their food 
  due to scarcity of water and they had fasted without drinking water at ‘Sehri’ 
  (Late night meal during Ramadan). He also said, they did not know if water 
  would be available at the time of ‘Iftar’ (Break fasting at the sunset). <br>
  While talking with us these persecuted people particularly the members of the 
  Ahmadya community of Bheramara looked very scared and panicky. At night on our 
  way back to Dhaka we came to know that Mominul Islam Rakib of Uttar Bhobanipur 
  was tied with a tree and beaten up simply for chatting with us. <br>
  <br>
  When we went to the houses of the victims on November 15 and 16 to know about 
  the incident of assault and persecution made on the minority Ahmedya Community 
  of Uttar Bhobanipur in Kushtia and Raghunathpur Bag in Jessore by the 
  fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami terrorists, the helpless Ahmedyas started 
  crying with the eyes of full tears. Everybody became thunderstruck to listen 
  the agonies of the helpless persecuted people. It is only possible by the 
  killer Jamaat-e-Islami to preach hatred and animosity against one sect of the 
  Muslims by another sect and instigate the ‘musollis’ to kill them by standing 
  in the mosque after Jumma prayer in the holy month of Ramadan of the Muslims. 
  Jamaat-e-Islami instigated the Pakistani invaders to commit genocide and 
  raping and abducting of women during the liberation war of 1971 for the sake 
  of Islam. They constitute various killing squads like Razakar, Al-Badr, 
  Al-Shams, etc. and took part in genocide. It is now becoming evident gradually 
  that after 1971 they are now sharing power in the government and making 
  preparation for another genocide like the one in 1971.<br>
  <br>
  It is unfortunate that no political party has so far expressed concern at the 
  persecution and killing of the members of Ahmadya Community of Jessore and 
  Kushtia. We feel there is no reason to think that the persecution of the 
  Ahmadya Muslim Community is not an isolated event, nor it is the outcome of 
  the present deteriorating law and order situation. Jamaat-e-Islami and their 
  other fundamentalist partners have been demanding since long that the 
  ‘Kadianees’ should be declared as non-Muslims. They have been making hostile 
  and provocative statements against them in the open public meetings. Being the 
  partners in power they now want to create a sort of social frenzy for 
  annihilation of Ahmedyas by using administration and mosque. Although the 
  Sunni Muslims are aggrieved at the assassination of Shah Alam in Jessore, we 
  observed a kind of collective effort for social boycott of the Ahmedyas of 
  Uttar Bhobanipur village in Kushtia. Either for having favour from or out of 
  fear of Jamaat-e-Islami the common people of Uttar Bhobanipur did not stand by 
  the side of the distressed persons as the way the people of Raghunathpur Bag 
  stood by the side of the family of the deceased Shah Alam. While we were 
  praying at the grave of Imam Shah Alam the Sunni Muslims of the village also 
  participated with us in the prayer.<br>
  <br>
  No political party, no government, nor any state can take the responsibility 
  of ascertaining as to who are real Muslims and who are not. This is also 
  contrary of the Holy Quran because the Quran do not permit such matter. 
  Jamaat-e-Islami is involved in this kind of anti-humanity and anti-Islamic 
  activities since the very inception of Pakistan.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
  The way Jamaat-e-Islami and their other associates fundamentalist 
  organisations have been making their evil efforts in creating a social frenzy 
  in their demand to declare the Kadianees’ as non-Muslims in the name of 
  religion, if it is not repelled its consequences would be fatal. By creating 
  an environment for killing and persecuting the opponents indicates that 
  henceforth it will not be possible to liable any person or organization for 
  such offences. It can be stated without any hesitation that if Jamaat-e-Islami 
  succeed in annihilation of Ahmedyas they would not abstain from attacking and 
  persecution anybody, any community and any organization by blaming them as 
  anti-Islamic, because this is the characteristic of Jamaati Politics.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
  Anti Fundamentalist Secular Democratic Society of Bangladesh is now more 
  endangered than ever before. Consecutively the members of minority religious 
  and ethnic communities are being attacked. They are being compelled to give up 
  their own religion, otherwise they are being put under all sorts of 
  persecutions. If this kind of persecution committed by the 4 party alliance 
  government is not resisted effectively the spirit of liberation war i.e. 
  secular democracy would not only be ruined but the thousand year old tradition 
  of communal harmony, tolerance and liberal of the Bengali nation would also 
  disappear from this country. If progressive, democratic political parties and 
  civil society do not stand jointly and vehemently against the rise of 
  fundamentalism and terrorism in Bangladesh, we all would have to bear the 
  responsibility of throwing the future generation into the vicious darkness of 
  fundamentalism.</font></p>
