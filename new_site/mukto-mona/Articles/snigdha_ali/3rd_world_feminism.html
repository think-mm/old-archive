	<font face="Verdana">The term feminism has been defined, analyzed, reviewed, 
	criticized, redefined, de-constructed, revisited or in other words has been 
	pulled and stretched from so many directions for so long that sometimes 
	writing about it feels like dragging a dead horse even beyond the outer 
	limits.&nbsp; This is no way to mean that feminism itself is a dead subject.&nbsp; On 
	the contrary, given the rapidly changing geo-political scenario in this era 
	of Globalization (and/or post-modernism), feminism now functions as more of 
	a foundational basis for many activists, policymakers and academicians than 
	as an epistemological framework only at the theoretical level.&nbsp; Hardly even

	<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">ism</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">s, 
	feminism has been a controversial one and an intensely debated upon ideology 
	from the very beginning of its introduction and acceptance in the sphere of 
	public knowledge.&nbsp; As can be the case for any such engaging and pervading 
	issue, feminism has been approached from different and sometimes contrasting 
	view points by the proponents of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its early days feminism was 
	primarily focused on inclusion of </font><span style="font-family: Verdana">
	&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">women</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">.&nbsp; 
	That is, women as a category was brought into attention against the backdrop 
	of absence of formal recognition and awareness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Feminists started voicing 
	the fact that the contribution of women in the Gross National Product (GNP) 
	or their involvement in the informal workforce has been largely ignored and 
	uncounted.&nbsp; The necessity of assessing the opportunity cost of household 
	works done by women, the social value of childbearing and motherhood, the 
	economic value of generating human capital became unavoidable.&nbsp; Impact on 
	women of various national and international policies like discriminatory 
	civil and judicial laws, privatization, structural adjustment etc. along 
	with existing patriarchal social and cultural norms that reinforced the very 
	process of discrimination were formally acknowledged and documented.&nbsp; 
	Feminists came a long way in protesting - and to quite an extent producing 
	practical results for - violence against women both at the private and 
	public spheres.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

		<font face="Verdana">But that was before.&nbsp; Since the decades of the 90s 
		- i.e. the height of post-modernism - more and more (primarily 
		post-colonial) feminist scholars<a name="_ftnref1" title href="#_ftn1"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>&nbsp; 
		are arguing to avoid universalist claims about </font>
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">women</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana"> 
		and situate feminism in a specific social, economic, cultural, 
		historical and political context for analysis, especially when 
		discussing the Third World.&nbsp; Third World societies are mostly 
		post-colonial, developing (economically speaking) countries and they are 
		situated at a juncture where legacies of old traditions and influences 
		of Western ways of life create fusion that continually shapes the 
		structure of the societies.&nbsp; Each Third World society is distinct and is 
		shaped by its cultural tradition, religion, social norms as well as the 
		position of the particular nation-state in the world system.&nbsp; As the 
		sovereignty of the nation-states have been compromised under 
		globalization national policies are greatly influenced by international 
		politics, affecting in turn, the citizens within each national 
		territory.&nbsp; One example of such a phenomenon would be how structural 
		adjustment policies adopted by Third World countries - pushed by the 
		World bank and the IMF - have restructured the economic and social 
		conditions and impacted the citizens overall and women in particular.&nbsp; 
		But one has to be cautious here.&nbsp; When considering how structural 
		adjustment or any policy so to speak or any social parameter is 
		affecting women, one has to be careful to distinguish among women from 
		different socio-economic backgrounds even within a country or a 
		region.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just because women from one country are being impacted does 
		not mean that all women in that same country are affected at the same 
		extent if all are affected at all.&nbsp; In Bangladesh, the opportunity to 
		work at the garments industries comes as an alternative survival 
		strategy for working women from the lower economic class (whether that 
		particular strategy is more exploitative or not is another issue), but 
		for middle class women the same thing translates into a lack of supply 
		of domestic help.&nbsp; What rural women face when indicted with Fatwas 
		following dire physical and social repercussions and what urban women 
		face realizing that Islamic rules are being imposed to further 
		strengthen the existing patriarchal structure - are very different 
		experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not to say that there should not be a term </font>
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">Third 
		World&quot; when talking about feminism.&nbsp; The factors along which the world 
		has been categorized as First and Third contribute to the differences of 
		experiences that women face in the First and the Third worlds.&nbsp; But 
		appropriate consideration has to be paid to the specificity of the 
		context.&nbsp; Very often Third World women have been presented as the </font>
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">oppressed</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana"> 
		without any attempt of further analysis of the form and extent of the 
		process of oppression.&nbsp; Upholding women's problems in mainstream 
		development planning or policy making conferences, or even at women</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">'</span><font face="Verdana">s 
		summits - where women meant White, middle class, Western women vis a vis 
		uneducated, ignorant, Third World women - has been widely criticized.&nbsp; 
		In other words, positing </font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">women</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana"> 
		as an analytical category has been problematized.&nbsp; Women as a group/ 
		social category is not a homogeneous collectivity.&nbsp; Term like </font>
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">women</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">'</span><font face="Verdana">s 
		problem/s</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana"> 
		often hides the fact that women from different class, culture, race and 
		religion face very different challenges and can experience even 
		contrasting outcomes of the same social phenomenon.&nbsp; </font></div>

		<font face="Verdana">At the same time, the feminists themselves have not 
		been spared either.&nbsp; Any researcher is to be subject to the same kind of 
		deconstruction as the research work itself to take into account the

		of argument which states the importance of multi-leveled and detailed

		<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">agency</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">.&nbsp; 
		The term agency implies the existence of a conscious awareness by women

		to the women of a community, is not only patronizing on their part it is 
		also a misconstrued&nbsp; reality to begin with.&nbsp; A Feminist&nbsp; or any 
		researcher or activist so to speak, has to work <i>with</i> the women 
		and not <i>on</i> them.&nbsp; This is particularly important for Action 
		Research.&nbsp; Action Researchers focus on the agency of people and they 
		believe that any pursuit of social change has to be a team effort.&nbsp; It 
		will be a mutually learning process where trained researcher/s and the 
		community women will benefit and learn from each other</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">'</span><font face="Verdana">s 
		experiences.&nbsp; This is very useful in lessening the bias that is 
		inherently associated with any research or knowledge production.&nbsp; How an 
		individual views an ideology or even a trivial issue in daily life 
		reflects not only that individual</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">'</span><font face="Verdana">s 
		preferences and values but also the socio-economic status (i.e 
		indicating a particular environment) of her/his that has constructed and 
		shaped the structure of her/his preferences and values.&nbsp; That is, 
		whichever stand we take regarding any matter we usually come carrying 
		our baggage of who we are and where we belong in the social hierarchal 
		system.&nbsp; The same goes for me as well.&nbsp; I write as a sociologist who 
		does research on women and socio-economic-political issues, who has been 
		formally trained to do research in the First world but who comes from 
		the Third World with a middle class background.&nbsp; Unknowingly or not, my 
		views and my analyses are shaped by my identity as a woman, as an 
		individual (regardless any gender identity), as a housewife, as a 
		student, as a researcher from the Third World and above all as someone - 
		who has been privileged enough to not face the struggles and oppression 
		that women from lower economic class have to endure and has the luxury 
		to think and write about feminism.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in">
	<font face="Verdana">At the end of 2003 I did some data collection in couple 
	of villages in Bangladesh.&nbsp; I approached PROSHIKA and hired an enumerator to 
	get me access to the village women who I wanted to interview.&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of 
	my research interest I wanted to interview Fatwa victims.&nbsp; The closest I 
	could get to that was that I was able to interview some of the relatives of 
	two Fatwa victims. In a village, called village X, a couple had recently 
	committed suicide after they were indicted by a village shalish.&nbsp; The woman 
	was guilty of falling for her brother -in-law and leaving her husband who 
	was mentally challenged.&nbsp; Ironically even though the husband and the in-laws 
	accepted the u incident, the village shalish wanted to set a precedence 
	through it.&nbsp; As PROSHIKA was active in that area they pressured the police 
	to enforce legal action against the preachers.&nbsp; As a result the police - 
	failing to arrest the escaped shalish leaders - captured as many male 
	members of the village as they could.&nbsp; I was told that even twelve years 
	boys had to hide not to get arrested.&nbsp; The police wanted to know the 
	whereabouts of the shalish leaders from the villagers which they did not or 
	could not divulge.&nbsp; This whole ordeal went for a month as the media covered 
	this incident and the police was forced further not to just let that go. 
	When I wanted to interview the female relatives I could not go to the 
	village as the frustrated villagers did not allow any outsider and 
	especially any PROSHIKA member enter the village.&nbsp; PROSHIKA has been working 
	in that area for years and does extensive works for women and yet became 
	banned from that village.&nbsp; A meeting was arranged in another village where I 
	could talk to the relatives of the couple. At the interview they told me 
	that the couple committed suicide not because they were publicly beaten (the 
	infamous Dorra) but because they were publicly humiliated when their heads 
	were shaved! They told me that a woman could take a lot but could not 
	sustain such a shame of losing her hair in public.&nbsp; I, sitting with them 
	with my salon cut short hair, had no problem relating to that.&nbsp; Because it 
	was the symbols and meanings carried with the punishment which were heavier 
	than the act of the punishment itself.&nbsp; And even if I think that what could 
	be more precious than life, I am in no position to criticize them from the 
	outside.&nbsp; This is what I learnt from Third World feminism - not to analyze 
	the incident out of its context.&nbsp; And for the same reason, when the grieving 
	relatives (all women) told me that even though they felt that sometimes the 
	punishment following a Fatwa was too harsh for women they still supported 
	the system of Fatwa as it was a functional mean of social control, who was I 
	to judge?&nbsp; Even if those same women had the generosity at heart to accept 
	the adultery committed by a woman and at the same time were anxious that if 
	there was no social control what would their children learn, who was I to 
	think I was more enlightened than they were?&nbsp; When I was very clearly told 
	by village women that what women did in Dhaka or on TV was not&nbsp; acceptable 
	to them, who was I to censure?&nbsp; I can only share my views with them, I 
	cannot impose on them.&nbsp; I can understand their positions in their context, I 
	cannot label them </font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana">oppressed</font><span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;</span><font face="Verdana"> 
	waiting to be rescued.&nbsp; I can present alternatives, I cannot force them. I 
	am an example of privilege.&nbsp; I am what any of them could be given my 
	background.&nbsp; And their views could be any of mine, given I lived in their 
	environment.&nbsp; If&nbsp; any kind of social change has to be made we have to work 
	both at the macro and the micro level. Feminism can not be addressed 
	separately from politics or isolated from other interconnected factors like 
	culture and religion.&nbsp; Some of my interviewees were extremely&nbsp; independent.&nbsp; 
	They not only earned money and functioned as the heads of the households - 
	they broke their problematic marriages, they sent their daughters to
