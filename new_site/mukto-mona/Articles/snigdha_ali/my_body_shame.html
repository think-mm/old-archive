&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was a rainy afternoon, and she was 
  walking fast. She was looking for a rickshaw to return home before it started 
  pouring heavily. And just when she thanked her stars for finding one, for the 
  millionth time the comment flew towards her - “Whew! What a body!” And for the 
  millionth time she was petrified. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It’s a strange feeling. She knew that 
  she had to have a body to host her beating heart, and she had a beautiful one, 
  but at the same time she wished that she didn’t have one. From the early 
  adolescence this was a source of worry for her mother and a source of 
  embarrassment for her. She tried to hide her physical existence as much as 
  possible. But every now and then women from the neighborhood, relatives, eve 
  teasers, female friends, or admiring Romeos let her know that she had a 
  beautiful body. Had she had a beautiful face that would have been a completely 
  different story. Parents would have been relieved with the hope of marrying 
  her off with less hassle. But here they were constantly worried that instead 
  of stimulating any aesthetic sense this kind of beauty might trigger off other 
  impulses and someone just might ‘Do’ something to their daughter. Instead of 
  accusing the culprit some people would blame their daughter for not taking 
  appropriate measures to protect herself. Some might even go further and blame 
  her for alluring the perpetrators. What a nightmare that would be ! Naturally 
  this sense of dread and shame was rightfully transferred to the girl’s mind. 
  She could never look at her body without feeling guilty. She could never think 
  of it as a source of pride or joy, or as an object of beauty, but a heavy 
  burden. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Can we really blame the hypothetical 
  parents ? Don’t we live in a society where rape and sexual assault against 
  women is a recurrent, unstoppable, morbid reality ? At the same time is this 
  all there is to this ? No. Usually, people - may be very slowly - but 
  constantly recreate and redefine the society they live in. Do we ?? Even if we 
  do how slow is that ? In our culture discussing sex or sensuality is a stigma. 
  Publicly an act of sex is discussed only in the background of reproduction or 
  the opposite of it, i.e. contraception. As if this is not something that gives 
  people bodily pleasure, or something which is beautiful, or something that can 
  express both physical and emotional intimacy - this is something hush hush. 
  Its there but its there almost like a ghost. So coming from such a society how 
  do we look at this now ? And more importantly how do women feel about this ? 
  Men, being the privileged gender in the normative sense, have the opportunity 
  to get exposed to different sources of information from the outside world. 
  They also get the chance to exchange opinions and ideas about sex among close 
  circles since our social and cultural norms allow men to talk about anything 
  and everything. Not to say that women will be ‘punished’ if they talked about 
  sex, but they would definitely be symbolically ostracized if they didn’t 
  choose the audience wisely. They would not fall under the category of ‘good’ 
  girls. Their limit is up to gossiping or filling up the vacuum with 
  imagination that is created by books or movies. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a result, women in our country do 
  not get any sex education, nor they always get to know the correct things. Not 
  even about reproduction. An astonishing number of women (married and 
  unmarried) don’t know that there exists an ecstacy called orgasm for women 
  too. It might sound shocking but even today, sitting in an affluent living 
  room in one of the US’s cosmopolitan cities, one woman could say that when 
  babies were born they were very tiny and that they grew to a human size ( the 
  5-10 pounds average size) instantly as they came out of the womb and the 
  outside air touched them ! She herself had given birth to two children !!! So 
  many women get pregnant unexpectedly only because they think they are taking 
  the correct protection based on their limited knowledge. Or, for not taking 
  any protection because of the fact that having sex is so overwhelming an 
  experience for them they solely concentrate on the present and forget about 
  the future. Growing up in that environment and now living in the US in a 
  contrasting environment, sometimes I stop and ponder. If the issue of sex can 
  be so excessively explicit, the fleshly expression of sensuality - the body, 
  can be such a source of pride, self esteem or happiness for women in the 
  Western world why does it have to be the opposite for us ? Islam as a religion 
  shuns the concept out for women (of course not for men as they are promised 
  such related joy in the afterlife) and we all know that religion plays an 
  important role in shaping the cultural norms, yet if we look at the Classical 
  Bengali literature we find that sensuality was such a prominent theme. Yes, as 
  usual as they were written by men almost exclusively the women were present as 
  the exotic ‘other’, but the point remains that the topic was vibrant. The 
  Baishnab Padabolies, Meghdut, Mahabharat all are examples of that. So why then 
  but not now ? It’s not that we haven’t evolved at all in regards to religion 
  influenced social codes of conduct. We don’t have to adapt a completely 
  Western attitude or expect to change the society overnight. But is it too much 
  to hope to just start sensibly addressing the issue, now, in 2002 ? </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A 23 years old Canadian born 
  Bangladeshi (or South Asian, living in Canada) woman suddenly started wearing 
  the Burqa in her adulthood. She thinks this is liberating for her. In response 
  to the excessive objectification of female body, insane rat race to ‘fit in’ 
  the trendy look, she has chosen to completely conceal herself from the human 
  eyes so that her appearance will not be subjected to any scrutiny. She feels 
  proud of her decision. Women in our country also wear the Burqa, mostly 
  because they think they have to, so not to be subjected to any lustful, sinful 
  and provocative thoughts or judgement. The outcome is the same but they are 
  derived from the opposite ends of the same spectrum - direct or created 
  impositions on women. At the cost of our identity, values and sanity can we 
  really afford to continue this ? Is it too much to ask that we begin a process 
  of unveiling the visible and invisible Burqa’s off ourselves? </font></p>
