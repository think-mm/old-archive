<p>(Be sure to check back for updates!)</p>
<p><img src="conv2006/JamilaBey.jpg" alt="Jamila Bey" width="100" height="150" class="fr" />
&bull; <b>JAMILA BEY</b> is a stand up comedienne who is also an &ldquo;out and proud&rdquo; Atheist.  
</p>
<p>
A Muslim father plus a Southern Baptist, Catholic convert mother, equals one confused child.
Throw a Jewish husband into the mix, and you have a walking punch line. Jamila Bey is a stand up
comedienne who is also an &ldquo;out and proud&rdquo; atheist.  Based in the nation&rsquo;s capitol, Jamila has
launched a faithless crusade using her comedic expertise to spread the gospel of reason and logic.
She&rsquo;s substantiated proof that you can indeed have joy without Jesus.  Jamila brings to the stage
a lethal dose of estrogen and a sharp and cynical style guaranteed to make you laugh!</p>

<p><img src="conv2006/DavidFitzgerald.jpg" alt="David Fitzgerald" class="fl" />&bull; <b>DAVE FITZGERALD</b> is one of the leading First Amendment activists in the Bay Area, and is on
the Steering Committee of San Francisco Atheists.  He is Director of Student Outreach for the
Garrison-Martineau Project, a community-building non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging
dialogue between believers and nonbelievers.  Mr. Fitzgerald also works closely with groups like the
National Center for Science Education, the Ask-A-Scientist lecture series, and the Secular Student Alliance.</p>
 
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald is the author of the forthcoming book, &ldquo;The 10,000 Christs and the Evaporating Jesus,&rdquo;
and will speak on the historicity of the Christian &ldquo;god-man.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="conv2006/JohnLoftus.jpg" alt="John Loftus" class="fr" />&bull; <b>JOHN LOFTUS</b>
is a former prosecutor for the U.S. Department of Justice&rsquo;s Nazi War Crimes Unit, and has authored several
books and articles on current history.  His books include <i>The Belarus Secret</i>, <i>Nazi Gold</i>,
<i>The Roots of Anti-Semitism</i>, and <i>The Secret World of Terrorism</i>.</p>
 
<p>His 1991 blockbuster expose <i>UNHOLY TRINITY: The Vatican, The Nazis and the Swiss Banks</i> (co-authored with Mark Aarons)
details how the Papacy ferreted Nazi criminals out of post-World War II Europe via the infamous &ldquo;ratline,&rdquo;
and exposed the ties between the Vatican, Swiss bankers and hidden Western investors.</p>
<p>Commentary from publisher, <i>UNHOLY TRINITY</i>:</p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Among other things, the authors demonstrate that U.S. and British code breakers were fully
aware of the Holocaust as early as 1941 but lied to the Western press; that the code breakers bugged the
Swiss banks and then buried secrets of Nazi gold transfers to protect U.S. intelligence chief Allen Dulles;
and that the Australian, British and Canadian governments are still waging a campaign to keep their citizens
ignorant about the Nazi was criminals living among them.&rdquo;</blockquote>
 
<p>Mr. Loftus is also an expert on the history of international terrorism and Islamic attempts to obtain
atomic, biologic and chemical weapons.  Unlike many political observers, however, he believes we may be
witnessing the death throes of fundamentalist faith-based terror states, and be on the verge of a
renaissance of modernity and enlightenment in the Middle East.  Loftus combines his encyclopedic knowledge
of contemporary history with current political developments -- it all makes for an informative
presentation and a unique perspective!</p>
<br style="clear:both" />
<p><img src="conv2006/EdMartin.jpg" alt="Ed Martin" class="fl" />&bull; <b>EDMOND J. (ED) MARTIN</b> was lead investigator and instrumental
in solving the mystery of what happened to Madalyn Murray O&rsquo;Hair and her two adult children (1997-2000).
After the trial of one of the criminals convicted in the murder case, the <i>Austin Chronicle</i> newspaper noted:
&ldquo;If not for the methodical investigation of Special Agent Ed Martin and the FBI, they (Gary Karr and David Waters)
would have gotten away with murder.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>A native of Louisiana, Mr. Martin grew up in New Orleans and earned his degree in accounting from
Southeastern Louisiana College.  He  worked for the Intelligence Division of the Internal Revenue Service, and was
part of the Department of Justice Strike Force that investigated New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and corruption
in the local police department.  
</p> 
<p>Ed Martin received an award for his &ldquo;Dedication to the Cause of Law Enforcement&rdquo; from the
U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office in Austin, TX. and was nominated for the FBI&rsquo;s Director&rsquo;s Award.
In 2002, he received the Law Enforcement Circle of Excellence Award from the Central Texas 100 Club.  He is
active in numerous public service organizations.  After nearly twenty-six years, Mr. Martin retired from the
IRD Criminal Investigation Division and established the private investigative firm of Sage Investigations, LLC.
</p>

<p>Ed Martin will speak on &ldquo;The Last Month of Madalyn, John and Robin.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="conv2006/AndreaMooreEmmett.jpg" alt="Andrea Moore-Emmett" class="fl" />&bull; <b>ANDREA MOORE-EMMETT</b> is
an award winning journalist, feminist and author of <i>God&rsquo;s Brothel</i>, a chilling indictment of contemporary
Mormon and Christian fundamentalist polygamy.  
</p> 
<p>Her writings have appeared in numerous publications including the Salt Lake City Weekly.  She has worked closely with
groups such as Tapestry Against Polygamy, an organization working to build awareness of how this oppressive practice enslaves
women of all ages.  Ms. Moore-Emmett&rsquo;s best-selling book examines the lives of 18 women who escape from
institutionalized polygamy; their touching stories include accounts of rape, incest and violence.
Far from being a voluntary, &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; lifestyle, polygamy is often, in fact, a form of sexual
slavery that is still overlooked in many parts of the country.  Although outlawed by the Mormon Church in the
late nineteenth century (a move politically motivated since it allowed Utah to gain statehood), the practice
still flourishes in growing enclaves.
</p> 
<p>Ms. Moore-Emmett was researcher for the documentary &ldquo;Inside Polygamy&rdquo; which aired on A&amp;E and
the BBC, and is the recipient of five Utah Excellence in Journalism awards from the Society of Professional Journalists.
She won a First Place Don Baker Investigative Reporting Award and a Leading Changes Award from the Utah Professional
Chapter of Women in Communications.  There will be a book signing for Moore-Emmett following her address at
the Convention.

&bull; <b>MICHAEL SHERMER</b> is a leading historian of science, writer, and founder of the popular <i>Skeptic Magazine</i>.
Dr. Shermer received his B.S. in psychology from Pepperdine University, a Master&rsquo;s Degree in experimental psychology
from California State University, and his Ph.D. in the history of science from Claremont Graduate University.
He is the author of numerous publications and books including <i>Science Fiction: Where the Known meets the unknown</i>,
<i>The Science of Good and Evil: Why People Cheat, Gossip, Share Care and Follow the Golden Rule</i>, and a biography of
Alfred Russel Wallace.  He also wrote <i>The Borderlands of Science</i> which examines the fuzzy land between science and
pseudoscience, and <i>Denying History</i> which examines Holocaust denial and other forms of pseudohistory.
</p>
<p>Dr. Shermer has appeared on such news programs as 20/20, Dateline, Charlie Rose, Larry King, and has been interviewed
for documentaries aired on PBS, A&amp;E, Discovery Channel, the History Channel and the Learning Channel.  He speaks

<h2><a name="cdclockinst">Countdown Clock Instructions</a></h2> 
<p>Adding our Convention Countdown Clock to your web site is very simple. All you have to do is insert two HTML lines to
your site code.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Add the stylesheet reference</h3>
<p>This goes into the HTML header area of your page:</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.atheists.org/convention/clock.css" /&gt;
</blockquote>
<p>The HTML header area is anywhere between the <i>&lt;head&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;/head&gt;</i> lines. You will usually find
the <i>&lt;title&gt;&hellip;&lt;/title&gt;</i> line in the HTML header.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Add an iframe</h3>
<p>In the spot where you would like the countdown timer to appear, add this HTML code:</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;iframe id="AAC" src="http://www.atheists.org/convention/clockiframe.html" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</blockquote>
<p>It can all go on one line, although splitting it up like this is OK too.</p>
<h3>Hints</h3>
<p>You can embed the <i>iframe</i> in a container, such as a centered <i>div</i>.</p>
<p>To make the <i>iframe</i> float left or right add a style attribute:</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;iframe id="AAC" style="float: left" src=&hellip;
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you add these statements as HTML, not as text content &ndash;  the brackets&nbsp;(<b>&lt;</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>&gt;</b>) are the
characters themselves, <b>not</b> their HTML entities:&nbsp;<b>&amp;lt;</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>&amp;gt;</b></p>

<h2><a name="ohistory">Oral History Project</a></h2>
<h3>The American Atheists Oral History Project<br />
Recording Your Atheist History For Posterity</h3>
<p>
One of the goals of the Charles E. Stevens American Atheists Library and 
Archives is to provide you with an opportunity to have your oral history 
recorded and preserved for posterity. It is important that you leave a 
record of what life was like for you, as an Atheist. There is no other such 
undertaking of its kind anywhere. Future generations will have the valuable 
opportunity to be able to reflect on who the Atheists of our era were, how 
they lived &ndash; and in their own words.</p>
<p>
At this year&rsquo;s 32nd National Convention of American Atheists, Mr. Bart Meltzer
will be videotaping the oral histories of conventioneers. A sign-up sheet 
will be available at the registration desk, and appointments for recording 
made on a first-come, first-serve basis. A list of questions will be 
provided in advance of the taping so that you can prepare your responses.</p>
<p>
They are:</p>
<ul>
<li> Your name</li>
<li> Your place of birth</li>
<li> Were you reared in a religious or non-religious home? If religious, what 
religion?</li>
<li> Are you a first, second or third generation Atheist?</li>
<li> What has been the most significant influence on your Atheism?</li>
<li> What has life been like for you as an Atheist in America?</li>
<li> In the time remaining for this interview, is there anything you would like 
to add?</li>
</ul>
<p>
The service is free for members of American Atheists. There is a $10 charge 
for nonmembers.</p>
<p>
The oral history recordings will only be made at the annual national 
Convention of American Atheists. So join us as we inaugurate this important 
new project to preserve the legacy of Atheism!</p>
