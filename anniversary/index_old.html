<p>Dear members,</p>
<p>Today is the first anniversary of Mukto-mona. Just a year ago on this day&nbsp; 
Mukto-mona was&nbsp; formed keeping an aim in mind to&nbsp; transform cultures, 
promote goodwill and&nbsp; to&nbsp; encourage people to think independently, 
without the need for faith in a particular dogma. Mukto-mona tried to build a 
platform for the members of different origin to form their own opinions on 
topics through a free and open discussion with the other members. The forum&nbsp; thus 
took an initiative 
to improve the process of critical thinking among the members and to provide a 
parallel encouragement in freethinking, humanism and rationalism in contrast to 
rigid adherence to what are perceived to be the most basic and traditional 
principles and beliefs. This is a very 
courageous attempt&nbsp; to build a platform of freethinking at that time while the whole world was 
seemed to  
gain&nbsp; raise of fanaticism and dogmatism in some sectors, specially in 
Indian subcontinent. </p>
<p>One question is asked quite frequently&nbsp; whether all the members of 
mukto-mona are really free from all kinds of dogma, if not how can we call this 
forum as &quot;mukto-mona&quot; ! Well, the answer is, there is no hidden religious/non-religious/political agenda 
for the subscription of membership in Mukto-mona- the aim is not to 
come to an agreed position on the topics in particular, but to encourage the 
interaction amongst members having different views. Thus, Mukto-mona does not 
wish to put restriction on the subscription of any member because of the 
ideology s/he holds, but&nbsp;&nbsp; wishes to promote a theme of freedom of thought, 
fairness of debate, honesty, 
democracy, and equality among the members. It's a great feeling to have people 
among us actively listen to 
what you or other members have to say. People with strongly held, unchallenged views, will find 
the discussion thought provoking.&nbsp; So this is the way of becoming the part 
of &quot;Mukto-mona&quot;, and be part 
of the new millennium in thinking.</p>
<p>What is the achievement of Mukto-mona in last one year? Well it is not a 
pleasant task for us to beat our own drum. We think it's totally our members' 
concern. Mr. fatemolla ( <b><font color="#000080">

<span style="COLOR: maroon; FONT-FAMILY: Comic Sans MS">
<O:P /></span>have already pointed out some of our achievements in their 
articles. It's our great pride to see freethinkers gathered in Mukto-mona not 
just for the thinking, they took initiative to move their thoughts into action 
out of social responsibility. Dear members, if we really did anything 
praiseworthy, all credit is yours !</p>
<p>What is the future of Mukto-mona ? Future of Mukto-mona is you, dear members.&nbsp;There
are many unfinished tasks in our hand . One of our objectives should be from now
on to build an infra-structure to form case against those prominent Razakars and
collaborators accused of war crimes in 1971&nbsp; in Bangladesh in the eye of
international law, so that our members can make it possible for Mukto-mona to
institute suits against those collaborators of '71 living in various countries
of the world, specially the western ones including the U.S. under the principles
of international law. We should not forget about the countless Bengali women who
were targeted for traumatic atrocities, harassment&nbsp; and abuses, notably
gang sexual assault and rape/murder in the horrifying days of the Pakistani
genocide. We could not do much rather than shedding tears for those unfortunate
Bitranganas (&quot;Heroic women&quot; of war) in our past.&nbsp; Indeed, it is
the high time to put pressure on Pakistan&nbsp;&nbsp; to get their apology at least,
remembering more than 450,000 Bangalee women raped and molested by Pakistani
occupation army, demand the recognition of the unrecognized heroines of our
Liberation War. </p>
<p>Thanks to the members who have spent their valuable time to write something 
on this occasion.&nbsp; All of their articles are kept in mukto-mona site (
