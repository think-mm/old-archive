  </b></O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">Islam permits unlimited sex with
  women taken as prisoners in a war. This was (or is) the practice of the
  Muslims including Muhammad during the ‘golden’ days of early Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Muhammad himself took Raihana a pretty young thing, who happened to be
  a married Jewish woman, captive (after the slaughter of Bani Quraiza male
  captives) as his concubine when she refused to marry him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Muhammad even presented many of his friends as well as his own
  sons-in-law (Ali and Othman) with pretty young captive women to be used as sex
  slaves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You talk about morality
  and good judgment! This was the respect and kindness that the Prophet of
  “mercy” had for the helpless women! Besides Raihana, Muhammad also took
  Jurawyirah (from the raid on Bani al Mustaliq) and Saffiya (a Bani Nadir
  Jewess from the raid on Khaibar) as his mistresses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Islamic apologists can’t wait to announce that Muhammad was so
  merciful that he married these two helpless women to free them from being sold
  as slaves. They will even let you believe that those helpless women, whose
  relatives were killed, were actually very happy to marry Muhammad as they fell
  in love with him after the slaughter. Was Muhammad a virile man in his early
  fifties? How disgusting and revolting it is that the prophet of Islam had
  inured this filthy practise of using the captives to satiate his libidinous
  urge!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The apologist will most
  certainly give you the impression that marrying them absolves all the
  culpability of Muhammad in slaughtering their male relations. What is the big
  deal in marrying a captive woman?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
  kind of bravery and chivalry is this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
  fact, it is an act of great cowardice and absolute meanness and an exposition
  of uncontrolled lust of the highest order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>What choice did those pitiful women had?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Even if Muhammad wanted to kill them or sell them as sex slaves, what
  could they do?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Practically, they
  could do nothing.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>What
  do the Muhammad’s followers are supposed to do today?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Are they not supposed to emulate him to the letter in every respect?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>No wonder that we witness such beautiful treatment of women in all the
  Islamic Paradises as I pen this essay in the dawn of the twenty first century.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">You see, whenever, the Muslim army
  conducted a raid, they always had the thirst for the succulent body of infidel
  women. Their desire to have sex with those captured women was so compelling
  that even Allah had to intervene to decree that these women could be raped
  after their menstrual periods were over. This uncivilized and despicable
  sexual urges of those Islamic soldiers were so barbaric that they would not
  even show sense of decency by having sex with their women prisoners in
  privacy. They would not hesitate to copulate with these hapless women right in
  the presence of their husbands who were infidels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>How outrageous! How despicable!&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">Read the following two hadith and
  judge for yourself the divinity in Islamic rules when you compare those with
  the rights of the POW as conferred by the Geneva Convention.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">The first hadith indicates that
  some Muslim soldiers were quite ashamed to perform sexual act with the captive
  women while their husbands were present. Are we not supposed to assume that
  most of the Jihadis were having sexual intercourse with the captive women
  right in front of their fallen (prisoner) husbands? How beautiful!! In recent
  times, we have seen this type of sexual perversions perpetrated by the Islamic
  army of Pakistan on their captive booties (captured women) in the genocide of
  Bangladesh in 1971. Isn’t it that the Pakistan army was just carrying out
  the contents of these ahadith?&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">Some Jihadis had sex with the
  captive women in the presence of their husbands and some were reluctant to do
  so (Sunaan Abu Dawud 11.2150)</font></span></p>
  <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">Abu
  Said al-Khudri said: &quot;The apostle of Allah sent a military expedition to
  Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain. They met their enemy and fought
  with them. They defeated them and took them captives. Some of the Companions
  of the apostle of Allah were reluctant to have intercourse with the female
  captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers. So Allah, the
  Exalted, sent down the Qur’anic verse, &quot;And all married women (are
  forbidden) unto your save those (captives) whom your right hand
  possesses&quot;. That is to say, they are lawful for them when they complete
  their waiting period.&quot;&quot; [The Qur’an verse is 4:24].</font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">One can have
  sexual intercourse with a captive woman after she is clear of her period
  and/or delivery. If she has a husband then her marriage is abrogated after she
  becomes a captive (Ref. 4:24)…(Shahih Muslim 8.3432)&nbsp;<O:P>

  <p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">Abu
  Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah her pleased with him) reported that at the Battle of
  Hanain Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent an army to Autas and
  encountered the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and taken
  them captives, the Companions of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him)
  seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women because of their
  husbands being polytheists. Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding
  that:&quot; And women already married, except those whom your right hands
  possess (iv. 24)&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></span></p>
  <p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">One
  might think that this type of sexual predatory practice was limited only to
  the ordinary Muslim soldiers who were sexually starved due to the war. The
  holiest of the holy men of Islam could have never indulged in such kind of
  depravity. Well, let us have a serious look at the following hadith that says
  that the holiest of the holy, Hazrat Ali, did do sexual intercourse with
  captive women even when he himself was married to Fatima, the daughter of
  Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. What a beauty!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In fact, the prophet of mercy and tolerance, instead of condemning and
  reprimanding Ali, even said that his son-in-law deserved more than that,
  perhaps meaning to say that he (Ali) deserved more sex from captive
  slave-women! The banality of Muhammad’s foray into sex with captive women
  knows no bounds and still then, the Muslims all over the world even today
  think that he is the ideal person whose life should be emulated by all
  Muslims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>

  Prophet sent 'Ali to Khalid to bring the Khumus (of the booty) and I hated
  Ali, and 'Ali had taken a bath (after a sexual act with a slave-girl from the
  Khumus). I said to Khalid, &quot;Don't you see this (i.e. Ali)?&quot; When we
  reached the Prophet I mentioned that to him. He said, &quot;O Buraida! Do you
  hate Ali?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you hate him, for
  he deserves more than that from the Khumus.&quot;&nbsp;<O:P>

  <p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">A
  natural question is, what happens if a captive woman gets pregnant as a result
  of having sex with the Jihadis? Many of those Islamic Jihadis did ponder over
  this unwanted pregnancy and wanted to practice coitus interruption
  (withdrawing before ejaculating) but Muhammad was quite against it, at times
  and was neutral at other times. Here are some beautiful ahadith. If you read
  these ahdith carefully, you will notice that the Jihadis did do coitus
  interruption not only to avoid unwanted pregnancy but it was also a method of
  giving them intense sexual pleasure and that was why they loved doing that!
  This means that those hapless captive women were meant not only to satisfy the
  normal sexual urge but were also a means to satisfy their captor’s sexual
  fantasies and perversions, which, perhaps they could not do with their married
  wives.&nbsp;<O:P>

  Allah's Apostle for the Ghazwa of Banu Al-Mustaliq and we received captives
  from among the Arab captives and we desired women and celibacy became hard on
  us and we loved to do coitus interruptus. So when we intended to do coitus
  interruptus, we said, 'How can we do coitus interruptus before asking Allah's
  Apostle who is present among us?&quot; We asked (him) about it and he said,

  on this. Those days it was all right to have captive women and to have sex
  with them because many Muslim soldiers were despatched to the war zones. So,
  to satisfy their sex appetite God permitted them to have such sex. The captive
  women also needed sex. So it was a win-win situation. See how beautiful the
  Islamic rules are!’ If we ask them whether this provision still applies
  today or not, they simply try to evade this question by saying something like,
  ‘You see, we must look at the context, when the Muslims conquer any nation

  peruse the above statement once again. What is the implication of this
  Mullah’s opinion? I must appreciate the Mullah for his utter honesty with
  respect to ‘real Islam.’ He did not beat around the bushes. He has given a
  straightforward, unadulterated, pure and unambiguous answer that clearly
  conforms to the rules of Qur’an and hadith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>May I ask the Islamic apologists to say a few words about this honest
  reply from this Mullah?&nbsp;<O:P>

  </font></span></p>
  <p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">Now,
  let us look at the wider implications of this ‘Islamic rule.’ Imagine that
  Islamic army invades America, Britain and all infidel lands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Also, imagine these infidels being defeated in a catastrophic war. What
  do you think the Islamic soldiers will do to all the male infidels?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>What do you think the Islamic soldiers would do to all the pretty/young
  women they would capture as captives?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do
  you think that these Islamic soldiers will honour the covenants of the Geneva
  Conventions on POW?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You must be
  out of your mind if you thought so. The soldiers of Islam will do exactly what
  the above Mullah has said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes,
  they will sell all the male captives as slaves and take the young/pretty women
  as sex slaves to satisfy their sexual urge. The old women would probably be
  killed, as they become a burden to the Muslim invaders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>For married women, their marriage will be immediately made null and
  void. To humiliate the great ‘Satan’ further, the Islamic Jihadis will
  probably do sexual act with the captive women right in front of their men who
  were just a short while ago their husbands.&nbsp;<O:P>

  <p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU"><font color="#000080">You
  may still think this to be impossible. But, wait!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The Pakistani Islamic army did just this in Bangladesh in 1971. They
  killed about 3 million Bangalees terming them as not so good Muslims, took
  250,000 Bengali women as concubines, and raped them, many of them repeatedly
  and not very far off from their near and dear ones. In recent times, we have
  heard many such reports from the Taliban ruled Afghanistan. These disturbing
  acts may enrage a lot of people, including many Muslims. Think again. Have the
  Islamic soldiers committed any crime/sin as far as Islam is concerned. The
  answer is a simple “NO.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
  doesn’t it make sense to realise that it is the Islam itself that is the
  motivating factor for the rape of the captive women?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In Iran a woman charged with adultery/blasphemy/apostasy carrying death
  penalty become a captive of the Islamic state. Therefore, an Islamic guard is
  appointed to have sex with her repeatedly before she is executed. This is a
  beautiful and “humane” treatment of infidel women prisoners in Islam!&nbsp;</font></span></p>

  </span>Did Islam ban this vile and disgusting trade in female flesh trade?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
