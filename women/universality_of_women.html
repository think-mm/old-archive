  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Until
  the mid-1970s, women’s rights concepts were not considered as culturally
  specific and were not divided into eastern or western, rather they were seen
  as something universal, and secularism and the separation of religion from the
  state were seen as pre-conditions for women’s liberation. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">In
  the mid-1970s, the idea of cultural Imperialism became a dominant discourse
  amongst nationalist/ anti-imperialist intellectuals and political and cultural
  circles in the west and the so –called Third World countries alike. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
  idea of cultural Imperialism supposedly had a progressive and militant guise:
  as part of the populist struggle in the so-called Third World countries
  against imperialism. In the Middle Eastern countries, opposition to
  ‘imperialist culture’ has been considered as an element of the fight
  against imperialism. Women have been the victims of the struggle against
  ‘imperialist culture’ and “Westernism”. This is because women’s
  liberation and women’s rights were seen as imperialist and western concepts.
  Traditionalist, religious and reactionary forces opposed women’s liberation
  in the name of fighting Imperialism and the West. <o:p>
  </o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
  idea of cultural Imperialism was the beginning of revising the idea of
  universality of women’s rights. The rise of political Islam and the
  anti-secularist backlash in the 1980s and 1990s imposed serious setbacks on
  civil rights especially on women’s rights in the so-called Islamic
  countries. These setbacks laid the framework for the idea that women’s
  rights in the Middle Eastern countries are culturally bound and should be
  defined according to religious and traditionalist values. This reactionary
  trend stamped on the concepts of women’s rights and equality in those
  societies in Ideology, thoughts and discourse. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">During the 1990s, post-modern theories particularly
  the theories of identity politics and cultural relativism, became the dominant
  discourse in academia and various Middle Eastern study centres in the West.
  Under the guise of avoiding orientalism, racism and Euro-centerism, these
  theories have justified and continue to justify the attacks on women’s
  rights, and have been haunting studies of the Middle East and particularly the
  study of women’s experiences in various Middle Eastern countries.<o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Post-modern theories emerged in the 1980s; at the
  time of the rise of conservatism, the attacks of capitalist market economy,
  the international ideological shifts and imbalances, the anti-secularist
  backlash and the rise of political Islam. These theories were the by-products
  of a time of uncertainty, darkness, setbacks and backlash.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Post-modern
  theories have increasingly questioned the project of Enlightenment. These
  theories criticize the ideals of truth, rationality, system, foundation,
  certainty and coherence. They refute a universal view on history, the world,
  and society as a whole and believe in fragmentation and differences, since
  according to these views, the history of humanity does not evolve in a
  universal direction toward modern and secularist norms and values. These
  theories doubt system and a universal truth, and base their essence on
  differences and fragmentation. From this standpoint the history has reached to
  its end, modernism failed to achieve its commitments, and secularism and
  universalism, all became empty words and terms. According to post-modern
  views, the dichotomy of oppressed and oppressor, oppressive regimes and people
  under their rule, backward cultural and religious values and women’s
  liberation, are invalid and do not exist anymore. <o:p>
  </o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">These
  theories tell us that the universality of women’s rights, modernity and
  secularism are all products of the evolution of western societies and
  therefore inapplicable and incompatible to non-western societies where
  indigenous cultural and religious values and norms are different than the
  West. Therefore, dominant secularist ideologies must be questioned and
  resisted where the viable traditions of social organization such as Islam can
  lay the framework for a more humane and egalitarian society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">John
  Esposito formulates this view as follows:<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">“At
  a time when the ideology of capitalism has desacralised all of human life for
  the sake of a destructive acquisitiveness, the need to open up non-capitalist
  spaces is more urgent than ever. The insistence on establishing alternative
  social imagery sakes Islam appears as the perennial threats it has always
  been. Especially because Islam may well be the most authentic voice of the
  South in its struggle against the western inspired and racially informed
  hegemonic aims of trans-national capital. Whatever the case, it has become
  quite clear that the nationalist secularist model of the post- independence
  period has utterly failed to emancipate the people and is now seen as a dismal
  failure.” <o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">And
  he continues:<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">“Secularism
  is not a separation between religion and the state, as propagated in both
  western and Arab writing. Rather, it is the removal of absolute
  values-epistemological and ethical- from the world such that the entire
  world-humanity and nature alike- becomes merely a utilitarian object to be
  utilised and subjugated. From this standpoint, we can see the structural
  similarity between the secular epistemological vision and the imperialist
  epistemological vision. We can also realize that imperialism is no more than
  the exporting of a secular and epistemological paradigm from the western
  world, where it first emerged to the rest of the world.”<o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">According
  to identity politics and cultural relativism, women’s quest for legal,
  political and economic equality is considered as culturally specific. It
  permits the justification of practices that oppress and dehumanise women in
  non- western cultures, when similar practices would be condemned as
  outrageous, unacceptable and barbaric in western culture.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">What
  is disturbing in reflecting women’s demands and struggle in the study of and
  by women in the Middle East is the attempt to refute women’s rights concepts
  and theories altogether as western ideas and incompatible to women’s
  situation in non- western countries. The suggestion is that the ideas of
  women’s rights and equality essentially functioned to provide moral
  justification for the attack on native societies or their indigenous culture
  and traditions.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
  pressure on women living in the Middle Eastern countries to denounce concepts
  of women’s rights as western, as ethnic specific and irrelevant to non-
  western contexts is one of the destructive and damaging consequences of these
  views. Sometimes even the previously accepted minimal elements of women’s
  rights in a non- western context are called into question. For example
  Patricia Higgins suggested that the plight of women in Iran concern only
  middle – and upper – class women, implying that the horrendous
  consequences of Islam in power were not significant for most Iranian women. <o:p>
  </o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Others
  have questioned maturity of Middle Eastern societies, and their women to enjoy
  such rights as sexual equality. Juliette Minces has argued that they are not
  ready “to undergo an emancipation which throws into question a non - secular
  equilibrium which has the full backing of religion”<o:p>
  </o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">One
  dramatic example is the silence of feminists in the West in face of systematic
  suppression of women’s basic human rights in Iran and countries under the
  rule of Islamic regimes and under the pressure of Islamic movements. Another
  example is the denial of asylum rights to people especially women fleeing
  oppression and gender-based persecution such as honour killing, forced
  marriage, stoning to death, veil and other Islamic practices and oppressive
  customs, under the name of respecting indigenous culture and religion. The
  third example is the way Western governments and their judicial systems treat
  the basic human rights of women and girls in the Islamic families and Islamic
  communities in the West, in face of forced marriage, honour killing, imposing
  the veil on girls under 16 which deprives them from social activities and
  enjoying their basic rights.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Presumably
  what is happening to women in those countries and communities is what they
  deserve and is more than enough for them. Why should geographic borders and
  the oppressive ruling reactionary culture and religion make what is conceived
  as oppressive in one culture an acceptable cultural norm in another? In fact
  none of women’s rights would have existed in the West if the concept of
  women’s equality were defined as and limited to Christian values and
  backward Victorian norms in Europe. Cultural relativism suggests that it is
  not acceptable to criticise the misogynist, sexist and derogatory religious
  and nationalistic culture and traditions that have been preserved, celebrated
  and reproduced as part of an untouchable national or cultural heritage
  generation after generation.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">If
  Islamic beliefs and the indigenous national culture in the Middle Eastern
  countries are not oppressive and therefore important barriers against
  development in women’s rights and liberation, why are women’s individual
  rights and social position worse in those countries than anywhere else?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">The conceptual frameworks
  laid by identity politics and cultural relativism prevent many western
  intellectuals including women’s rights activists from seeing and
  appreciating the diversified women’s movements in the Middle East. The
  hegemonic influence of the western image of Middle Eastern women as veiled,
  obedient, subservient and backward, overshadows the mounting evidence of their
  intellectual, cultural and political changes in the region. This distorted
  understanding of women’s life experiences, concerns and expectations is
  reproduced and repeated in this stereotype. The idea is that, because socio -
  economic problems are more pronounced in the region and because traditionalist
  gender roles and male dominance are more rigidly maintained and reproduced,
  issues of concern to western women such as freedom from sexual oppression and
  women’s complete equality with men are irrelevant to Middle Eastern women.</p>
