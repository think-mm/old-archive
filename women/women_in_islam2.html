  witness is half of men...2:282</span></font></h4>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">This is a very well known fact in
  Islam. Even if a woman is the Prime Minister of an Islamic Paradise she is
  still inferior to the dumbest of men when it comes to legal matters. Her
  evidence by herself is never acceptable in an Islamic court of law. It is
  because of her deficiency in intelligence and lack of memory. What a disgrace
  to women and their ability of judgment! What happens if a woman becomes a
  judge? I really do not know the answer. Not only that a single woman’s
  evidence is unacceptable in an Islamic court, but also the women witnesses are
  completely unacceptable in <i>Sharia </i>where <i>Hudud</i> punishments are
  involved such as adultery, apostasy, theft…etc. This means that if a woman
  is raped her evidence or the evidence of any other women (even though there
  were thousands of women who witnessed the very act with their own eyes) will
  not be accepted unless four adult Muslim men give evidence that they saw the
  actual act of fornication with their own eyes. What a justice! I think even a
  Kangaroo court is better than this type of Islamic court. Now, let us hear
  from the Qur’an. This verse is very lengthy, in fact, the longest verse in
  the Qur’an. Therefore, I shall quote only the relevant part.</span></p>

  Whenever this verse is cited as anti-feminine and derogatory to women, our

  </span>It is truly great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It can
  discover which no science or medicine could find! Let me ask our Islamic
  brothers a simple question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
  menstruation is a disease, then why do we not ask the women to see a doctor?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Why should the women be ostracised during her period?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Sex during period is not advisable, although medical evidence shows
  that it is ok.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This simple fact
  does not need any intervention from the almighty God through His mighty
  Qur’an.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the primitive
  people had the knowledge of this natural periodic cycle of women and knew how
  to tackle it without insulting and ostracising women. Why did Muhammad do
  that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was all based on the old
  Jewish/Zoroastrian practice of segregating women to a secluded place during
  her period. Muhammad did not have the guts to completely reform this
  discriminatory treatment of women but maintained that age-old tradition.</span></p>

  Islamic scholars of all times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
  Muslims would even say that his position is next to Muhammad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This ‘great’ Islamist was one the most anti-woman scholar I had
  ever read.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here are a few
  ‘gems’ from this greatest of all Islamists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I wonder how is it possible for a woman to be more pious than a man is
  when both Qur’an and ahadith find so many faults in her and relegate her
  position in society to that of a slave and an animal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>To make sure that a woman is inferior to a man and she is always below
  him Imam Ghazali categorically advises Muslims not to marry rich women
  forgetting the fact the founder of Islam (Muhammad) himself married one of the
  richest lady in Arabia (Khadija) and without her immense wealth Muhammad could
  never have been what he dreamed of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Talk
  about double standard in Islam!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why
  does Imam Ghazali have to prescribe such a marital prescription?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A prescription for disaster, may I add?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>He knew the power of money and wealth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>He knew that a rich lady would never accept the degrading treatment of
  hers in the hands of her husband; she will simply desert her man if ever any
  man dares to dehumanise her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
  the gross sexism of Islam must prevail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
  he had no choice but to recommend marrying poor women, for, their financial
  dependence on men will ensure their inferiority and servitude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The matter of inheritance in Islam is
  quite a lengthy issue and it is downright contentious too!.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It is not an appropriate matter to be discussed in this essay, which is
  solely devoted to women related issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
  let us not forget the unfairness of Islam towards women on this matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Women get only half that men get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Many Islamists justify this rule by saying that a woman does not
  contribute anything to the creation of a family wealth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>All the money she gets is for hers to keep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>They also contend that other religions gave no rights of inheritance to
  women. Islam was/is the only religion that gave women some rights of
  inheritance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first argument
  can be countered by the reasoning that the man who inherits something from his
  relatives also did not put an effort to the creation of wealth of the relative
  concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, a man or a woman
  inheritor is in the same footing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So,
  why shouldn’t they have equal share in inheritance?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The second argument is simply not relevant in today’s world. No other
  religion follows their age-old/antiquated inheritance rules any more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Most of them follow the secular rules.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It is only the Islam that still persists on keeping this gross unfair
  inheritance rules.</span></p>

  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> Allah (thus) directs you as regards your Children's
  (Inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females: if only
  daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only
  one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of the inheritance to
  each, if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the
  (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased Left brothers (or
  sisters) the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases ('s) after the
  payment of legacies and debts. Ye know not whether your parents or your
  children are nearest to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by
  Allah; and Allah is All-knowing, Al-wise.</p>
