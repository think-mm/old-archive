        <p><font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The Indian Constitution
        guarantees equal rights to both the sexes and does not discriminate on
        the basis of sect, color and creed.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">However, despite the
        constitutional provisions, do women enjoy equality with men?</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The answer is 'No'. Their
        condition still remains miserable. Newspapers carry report of rape and
        burning of women for not bringing sufficient dowry or their inability to
        satisfy the demands of greedy in-laws.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Basically, our present attitude
        towards women stems from our religious scriptures that refer to women as
        contemptuous.</font><br>
        <font face="sans-serif" size="3">Our oldest books are the 'Vedas' that
        contain highly objectionable and condemnable passages concerning women.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Taking cue from the 'Vedas'
        authors of subsequent religious scriptures referred to women in more
        contemptuous form.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3"><b>'Sati pratha'</b> (custom of
        burning the widow with the body of her husband), <b>'Dasi Pratha'</b>
        (keeping the slave girls), <b>'Niyog Pratha'</b> (ancient Aryan custom
        of childless widow or women having sexual intercourse with a man other
        than husband to beget child) were among cruel customs responsible for
        the plight of the women.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Naturally, seeking shelter under
        such religious sanctions, unscrupulous men disgraced women to the
        maximum possible extent and made them means of satisfying their lust.</font>

        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">As a result, female infant came
        to be considered as unwanted. No one wanted a daughter. Everyone was
        interested in having a son. The birth of the son was celebrated, but the
        birth of the daughter plunged family into gloom.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">This attitude still persists,
        even though certain other customs have undergone changes.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">'Rig Veda' itself says that a
        women should beget sons. The newly married wife is blessed so that she
        could have 10 sons, so much so, that for begetting a son, 'Vedas'
        prescribe a special ritual called 'Punsawan sanskar' (a ceremony
        performed during third month of pregnancy). During the ceremony it is
        prayed:</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;<b>Almighty God, you have
        created this womb. Women may be born somewhere else but sons should be
        born from this womb</b>&quot; - Atharva Veda 6/11/3</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;O Husband, protect the son
        to be born. Do not make him a woman.&quot; - Atharva Veda 2/3/23</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In 'Shatpath Puran (shatpath
        Brahman)' a sonless woman has been termed as unfortunate.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">'Rig Veda' censures women by
        saying:</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;<b>Lord Indra himself has
        said that women have very little intelligence. She cannot be taught</b>&quot;
        - Rig Veda 8/33/17</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">At another place it is written:</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;<b>There cannot be any
        friendship with a woman. Her heart is more cruel than that of a hyena</b>&quot;

        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Shatpath Puran, preaching of the
        'Yajur Veda' clubs women, 'shudras' (untouchables), dog and crows
        together, and says <b>falsehood, sin and gloom</b> remain integrated in
        them. (14/1/1/31)</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In 'Aiterey Puran', preaching of
        the 'Rig Veda' in Harish Chandra -Narad dialogue, Narad says:</font><br>

        </div>
        <br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">To insult and humiliate women
        further, the religious books speak of women having <b>sexual intercourse
        with animals</b> or expressing desire for intercourse with them. What
        further insult can be heaped on women?</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In 'Yajur Veda' such references
        are found at a number of places where the principal wife of the host is
        depicted as having intercourse with a horse.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">For example consider the
        following hymn:</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;All wives of the host,
        reciting three mantras, go round the horse. While praying, they say: 'O
        horse, you are, protector of the community on the basis of good
        qualities, you are protector or treasure of happiness. O horse, you
        become my husband.'&quot; - Yajur Veda 23/19.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;After the animal is
        purified by the priest, the principal wife sleeps near the horse and
        says: 'O Horse, I extract the semen worth conception and you release the
        semen worth conception'&quot; - Yajur Veda 23/20.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The horse and principal wife
        spread two legs each. Then the Ardhvaryu (priest) orders to cover the
        oblation place, raise canopy etc. After this, the principal wife of the
        host pulls penis of the horse and puts it in her vagina and says:
        &quot;This horse may release semen in me.&quot; -Yajur Veda 23/20.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Then the host, while praying to
        the horse says:</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;O horse, please throw semen
        on the upper part of the anus of my wife. Expand your penis and insert
        it in the vagina because after insertion, this penis makes women happy
        and lively&quot; - 23/21.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In the Vedic age, the customs of <b>polygamy</b>
        was prevalent. Each wife spent most of the time devising ways and means
        to become favorite to her husband. Clear references are available in <b>'Rig
        Veda', (14/45),' and Atharva Veda (3/81)'</b></font>
        <div align="center">
          <br>
          <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Custom of Polygamy</b></font>
        </div>
        <br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The Aryans in those days used to
        attack the original inhabitants of this place, or other tribes within
        their own race; loot them and snatch away their women. Thus, militant
        and wicked men had more wives. This custom of polygamy helped a great
        deal in bringing down the [status of] &nbsp;women.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In 'Rig Veda' (10/59) it is
        written that Lord Indra had many queens that were either defeated or
        killed by his principal wife.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In 'Aitrey Puran', preaching of
        'Rig Veda', (33/1), there is a reference to the effect that <b>Harish
        Chandra had one hundred Wives.</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">'Yajur Veda' in the context of 'Ashva
        Medha' (Horse Sacrificing ceremony), says that many wives of Harish
        Chandra participated in the 'Yagyna' (religious sacrifice).</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In 'Shatpath Puran (Shatpath
        Brahmin)', preaching (13/4/1/9), of the Veda, it is written that four
        wives do service in 'Ashva Megha'. In another Puran (Tatiraity Brahamin,
        3/8/4), it is written that wives are like property.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Not only one man had many wives
        (married and slave girls), but there were cases of <b>many men having a
        joint wife</b>. It is confirmed from the following hymn in 'Atharva
        Veda':</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;O men, sow a seed in this
        fertile woman&quot; - Atharva Veda 14/1</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Both these customs clearly show
        that a woman was treated like a moving property. The only difference
        between the two customs was that whereas according to former one man had
        a number of movable properties, in the latter, several men had a joint
        movable property.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">'Vedas' also sanction 'Sati
        Pratha.'</font>
        <div align="center">
          <br>
          <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Widow was burnt at the

        </div>
        <br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The widow was burnt at the
        funeral pyre of her husband so that she may remain his slave, birth
        after birth and may never be released from the bonds of slavery.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The Atharva Veda says:</font><br>
        <font face="sans-serif" size="3">&quot;O dead man, following the
        religion and wishing to go to the husband's world, this woman comes to
        you. In the other world also may you give her children and wealth in the
        same manner.&quot;</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In t</font><font face="sans-serif" size="3">he
        'Vedas', widow is treated inhumanly. For example, it is mentioned that
        on death of her husband, the wife was handed over to some other man, or
        to her husband's younger brother.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Swami Vivekananda opines that
        even at that time women used to have sexual intercourse with a person
        other than her husband to beget a child.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The hymn says:</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">&quot;O woman, get up and adopt
        the worldly life again. It is futile to lie with this dead man. Get up
        and become the wife of the man who is holding your hand and who loves
        you. - Rig Veda 10/18/8</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Apparently this shows that woman
        is considered to be a property. Whenever and whosoever desired, could
        become her master.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">If the woman was not remarried,
        then her head was shaved. This is evident from Atharva Veda (14/2/60).</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">This cust</font><font face="sans-serif" size="3">om
        was obviously meant to disgrace her. What connection does shaving of
        widow's head has with the death of her husband ?</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The condition of widow was
        miserable. She was considered to be a harbinger of inauspiciousness and
        was not allowed to participate in ceremonies like marriage. This custom
        is still prevalent in some places. She has to spend her life alone</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In Rig Veda there are references
        to <b>slave</b> girls being given in charity as gifts. After killing the
        men folk of other tribes, particularly of the native inhabitants, their
        women were rounded up and used as slave girls. It was custom to present
        slave girls to one another as gifts.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The kings used to present
        chariots full of slave girls to their kith and kin and priests (Rig Veda
        6/27/8). King Trasdasyu had given 50 slave girls. It was custom to
        present slave girls to Saubhri Kandav (Rig Veda 8/38, 5/47/6).</font>

        <br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">A slave girl was called 'Vadhu'
        (wife), with whom sexual intercourse could be performed without any kind
        of marriage ceremony.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3"><i>These girls belonged to the
        men who snatched them from the enemies</i>, or who had received them in
        dowry, or as gifts. Only the men to whom they belonged could have sexual
        intercourse with them.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">But some slave girls were kept as
        <b>joint</b> property of the tribe or the village. Any man could have
        sexual relations with them. These girls became the prostitutes.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The 'Vedas' also talk about 'Niyog',
        the custom of childless widow or woman having sexual intercourse with a
        person other than her husband to beget a child.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In simple words 'Niyog' means
        sending a married woman or a widow to a particular man for sexual
        intercourse so that she gets a son. Indication of this custom is
        available in 'Rig Veda.'</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In 'Aadiparva' of 'Mahabharata'
        (chap. 95 and 103), it is mentioned that Satywati had appointed her son
        to bestow sons to the queens of Vichitrvirya, the younger brother of
        Bhishma, as a result of which Dhratrashtra and Pandu were born.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Pandu himself has asked his wife,
        Kunti, to have sexual intercourse with a Brahmin to get a son (Aadi
        Parva, chapters 120 to 123).</font>

        </div>
        <br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In the name of 'beejdan' (seed
        donation), men used to have sexual intercourse with issueless women.
        This was a cruel religious custom and the chastity of the women was not
        safe. The so-called caretakers of the religion were allowed to have
        sexual intercourse with other man's wife.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">From 'Niyog pratha' it can be
        inferred without fear of contradiction that women were looked upon as
        mere child-producing machines.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In 'The Position of Women in
        Hindu Civilization,' Dr. B. R. Ambedkar writes: &quot;<b>Though a woman
        is not married to man, she was considered to be a property of the entire
        family. But she was not getting share out of the property of her
        husband, only son could be successor to the property</b>.&quot;</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">Gajdhar Prasad Baudh says: &quot;
        <b>No woman of the Vedic age can be treated as pure</b>. Vedic man could
        not even keep the relations between brother-sister and father-daughter
        sacred from the oven of rape and debauchery/adultery named 'Niyog'.
        Under the influence of intoxication of wine, they used to recognize
        neither their sister nor their daughter and also did not keep the
        relationship with them in mind. It is evident from their debauchery and
        adultery what a miserable plight the women had in the society then!
        (Refer 'Arya Niti Ka Bhadaphor'. 5th Edition page 14).</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">In the 'Vedas' there are
        instances where <b>daughter was impregnated by her father and the sister
        by her brother.</b></font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">The following example of sexual
        intercourse is found between father and daughter in the 'Rig Veda':</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3"><b>&quot;When father had sexual
        intercourse with his daughter, then with the help of earth he released
        his semen and at that time the Righteous Devas (deities) formed this 'Vartrashak
        (Rudra) Devta'</b> (Pledge keeper deity named Rudra).&quot; - Atharva
        Veda (20/96/15).</font>

        </div>
        <br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">From the aforesaid account, it is
        clear that in the Vedas women have been considered to be low-grade
        creatures.</font><br>
        <font face="Arial Unicode MS" size="3">It is high time we expose
        scriptures, preaching such inhuman teachings so that they lose their
        credibility. Only then can there be a hope on women's liberation, and of
        equality between sexes that is guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.</font>
