  <img hspace="5" src="fm08-06.jpg" align="left" width="202" height="144"> Her's was the typical story of
  an educated girl. She was unmarried and for years had been a burden on her
  widowed mother. Finally, desperation came into play and her mother placed an
  ad in the newspapers for a perfect match. However, the reply that came, was
  far from what the girl's mother expected. The only man who answered the ad was
  from a shanty town, had yellow teeth, white beard and a green muffler hanging
  around his invisible neck. He was also fat by any standard. The girl hated him
  from the word go, but knew her mother would beg her not to reject him. His
  best trait was that he was a good salesman and had money. She nodded her head
  that day, and cried all night.<br>
  <br>
  Ever since her father died many years ago, her mother had taken care of her
  and her siblings. She was a burden on the family because of her education that
  had failed to provide her a good job. On that particular day, her miserable
  life had provided her a horrible husband. And she had to say yes.<br>
  <br>
  There are hundreds of thousands of such 'yes' girls all across Pakistan. And
  elderly men who are taking full advantage of this situation. They come
  forward, offering help to such girls, some as old as their grand fathers.
  True, some girls do raise alarm but nobody listens. They resign to their fate,
  willingly and happily. This home has two to four girls of marriageable age,
  who are waiting for proposals to come around.<br>
  <br>
  Some girls deliberately fail in their examinations as colleges and schools are
  their only refuge. They suffer no stares there for not being married. Some
  genuinely feel they are taken as a burden. They seldom show happiness and
  mostly eat less at the dinning table.<br>
  <br>
  Some take courses in beauty parlours, computer centres while others teach in
  schools. Some of these unfortunate girls tend to indulge in mock love affairs.
  Married neighbours and well-off relatives also take advantage and make fool of
  them. These girls are mostly tired of going into the drawing room (whatever
  the size) full of those males and females who blatantly examine them from top
  to bottom. And after eating and drinking, they promise to reply after talking
  to some uncle in Dubai or elsewhere. They never respond.<br>
  <br>
  Every one of these visits, usually cost more than a thousand rupees to
  families with meagre resources. They have to oblige because they are
  larkiwalas (girl's family)!<br>
  <br>
  Almost every home has a girl and they are toyed around with by almost
  everyone. Even cousins play villains. They hoodwink poor innocent cousins,
  have a good time with them and finally marry girls from rich families who can
  support them financially. With the spread of education, now girls usually keep
  such unscrupulous guys at bay, but some do fall prey and later repent.<br>
  <br>
  Some loving uncles and aunts also play havoc with such girls. In one case, a
  religious man married his son to his niece and took her to New York, the
  ultimate dream of scores of Pakistani girls. When she reached there it was a
  nightmare. The poor girl had to cook meal for more than forty people since his
  uncle loves to have paying guests from his native town. She would work ten to
  fifteen hours and was not allowed to see her husband even once a week. She
  never informed her family in Pakistan. But when one night she was kicked out
  of the house, during freezing December rains, she made a collect call to a
  relative who rescued her. She filed for divorce and won freedom. However that
  treacherous uncle flew once again to Pakistan and married another girl to his
  son and went back. How many families suffer due to such people?<br>
  <br>
  By tradition Pakistanis tend to hide unpleasant happenings in their families.
  But this must stop. There is no justification in exploiting a girl's parents.
  Will this ever end? Perhaps not, in the near future. But we've at least got to
  try.<br>
  <br>
  This has been going on for generations. My own father, who was not a bad man,
  but seldom he was nice to my mother. I mostly found tears in her eyes. One day
  I asked her, &quot;Did you like this man when you married him?&quot; She
  looked around and replied in her meek voice, &quot;No, I was his second wife,
  he was a widower.&quot; Then why had grandfather agreed to her marriage?
  &quot;He had no option and I was not allowed to even say yes.&quot; My mother
  died of cancer after giving birth to fifteen children. He was our father who
  was never liked by my mother. This is life.<br>
  <br>
  It is not easy to live as a girl or a woman. A top lady political activist,
  who lost her young husband after hardly ten years of love marriage, suddenly
  married a man of her father's age.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Frankly I was tired of proposals offered day and night. One day I called
  it a day and asked this father of six whether he could take care of my three
  children as well. He said yes and that's all.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  She is happy, secure and safe. However, it is not that easy for all. A young
  girl who lost her bank officer husband in a robbery last winter was offered
  casual job at the bank. She joined and was very comfortable with the
  environment. Especially the chief of the bank who was like a grandfather to
  her. She loved to work with that angel. But one day that angel offered her to
  become his third wife. She promised to reply tomorrow. Tomorrow never came.
  She left the job. Now she has to live again with seven brothers and sisters
  and tears of her mother. Her father was a quiet man. He has become quieter and
  quieter. This is life in Pakistan, a front-line state against international
  terrorism. Internally it is terror everywhere.<br>
