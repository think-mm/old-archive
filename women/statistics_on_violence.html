  <p>Here is some data on violence against woman in the USA (copied from
  National Organization of Women website; www.now.org) . They might want to work
  on a massive house cleaning before Uncle Sam and Co. open their mouth about
  the rest of the world on this issue:<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #CCFFFF">MURDER</span></b>. Every day
  four women die in this country as a result of domestic violence, the euphemism
  for murders and assaults by husbands and boyfriends. That's approximately
  1,400 women a year, according to the FBI. The number of women who have been
  murdered by their intimate partners is greater than the number of soldiers
  killed in the Vietnam War.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #CCFFFF">BATTERING.</span></b> Although
  only 572,000 reports of assault by intimates are officially reported to
  federal officials each year, the most conservative estimates indicate two to
  four million women of all races and classes are battered each year. At least
  170,000 of those violent incidents are serious enough to require
  hospitalization, emergency room care or a doctor's attention. SEXUAL ASSAULT .
  Every year approximately 132,000 women report that they have been victims of
  rape or attempted rape, and more than half of them knew their attackers. It's
  estimated that two to six times that many women are raped, but do not report
  it. Every year 1.2 million women are forcibly raped by their current or former
  male partners, some more than once.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style="background-color: #CCFFFF">THE TARGETS.</span> </b>Women are
  10 times more likely than men to be victimized by an intimate. Young women,
  women who are separated, divorced or single, low- income women and
  African-American women are disproportionately victims of assault and rape.
  Domestic violence rates are five times higher among families below poverty
  levels, and severe spouse abuse is twice as likely to be committed by
  unemployed men as by those working full time. Violent attacks on lesbians and
  gay men have become two to three times more common than they were prior to
  1988.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #CCFFFF">IMPACT ON CHILDREN.</span></b>
  Violent juvenile offenders are four times more likely to have grown up in
  homes where they saw violence. Children who have witnessed violence at home
  are also five times more likely to commit or suffer violence when they become
  adults.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style="background-color: #CCFFFF">IMPACT ON HEALTH AND SOCIAL
  SERVICES.</span></b> Women who are battered have more than twice the health
  care needs and costs than those who are never battered. Approximately 17
  percent of pregnant women report having been battered, and the results include
  miscarriages, stillbirths and a two to four times greater likelihood of
  bearing a low birth weight baby. Abused women are disproportionately
  represented among the homeless and suicide victims. Victims of domestic
  violence are being denied insurance in some states because they are considered
  to have a &quot;pre-existing condition.&quot;</p>

  <p>Rafida Ahmed Bonna,</p>
  <p>I am an American woman and you are right about the statistics on violence
  against women in America. When I was a firefighter, we once had a woman pull
  into the station who had been beaten very badly. She had several broken ribs,
  a broken arm, a cracked skull, and her whole face was so swollen that she
  could only see out of a slit in one of her eyes. She had somehow in that state
  managed to put both of her small children into a child seat in the back of her
  car and drive to the station for help. Her kids were very quiet. There was a
  little girl and a little boy. Both had lung infections and were pretty sick.
  The police came and the man was arrested and charged and put in jail, but only
  because she pressed charges. If the woman won't press charges then the police
  can do nothing. The woman had probably been beaten less severely many times
  and gone back to him and not pressed charges. That is the so called
  &quot;Pattern of Domestic Violence&quot; He beats the crap out of her, then
  says he is sorry and won't do it again and buys her flowers or something so
  she won't leave him and press charges. Then he beats her up again....and
  again.... and it continues until she leaves or he kills her. Almost every City
  in the country has a place (or several) called a battered women's shelter.
  When people get rid of old clothes or furniture or appliances they can either
  give them to the salvation army or to the women's shelter. The location of
  these places is kept secret. Women who want out of an abusive relationship can
  call a free number and go there and people will help them get a new start.
  Even with the shelters, most women have to let things get pretty bad before
  their friends can convince them leave and go to a shelter.</p>
  <p>In this country, most rapes are not reported. The reason is that many
  times, no one believes the victim. The guy will say that she consented and she
  will say she didn't. At that point, the entire trial turns to the purpose of
  making the woman look like a slut so the jury won't believe it was rape. No
  woman wants to go through that. It must be said that there are many cases when
  a woman has said a man raped her when he didn't.</p>
  <p>There are many types of women in this country. There are intelligent
  educated women and helpless women, firefighters and beauticians, manipulative
  women and honest women, murderers and rapists (yes, women have been known to
  sexually assault other women and sometimes men, though it is rare, or at least
  rarely reported). There are women who are police and women who are criminals.
  There are women who are drug addicts and women who are doctors. There are
  prostitutes and nuns. There isn't much in this country that women haven't
  done, both good and bad. This country has much violence and much that is wrong
  with it. There are many grass roots community efforts to try to fix what is
  wrong in America. I think the thing that I like about America is this...if a
  man comes in my home and shoots me, it will be on the news and the police will
  do an investigation and try very hard to catch whoever did it. If my husband
  beats me, I can go to a womens shelter and I can call the police and have him
  arrested. If someone rapes me, I can call the police and have him arrested. I
  don't like the idea of the trial I would go through, but I can't think of a
  better way. You can't just go convicting people just because someone said so.
  Men who go to jail for rape and for domestic abuse are not treated very kindly
  by other inmates while they are in prison. Many are raped and abused
  themselves. I would not want an innocent man to go through that.</p>
  <p>America is far from perfect, but we Americans are not just standing idly by
  and watching all of this happen. I think that if you try not to judge America
  by it's government, but instead by it's citizens, you will see that we are
  indeed as you said, very much like other countries and that our people run the
  gamut from very bad to very good, from selfish to humanitarian, from rich to
  poor, from fundamentalist to rationalist, from uneducated to PhD, and from
  Black to white and every race in-between.</p>
