  <p><b><i>Prologue:</i></b> </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#008000">After
  the Islamic revolution in Iran many people became interested in Islam, which
  was, hitherto, a very obscure religion usually associated with the Arabs, the
  poor, and the Blacks. Although I was a born Muslim and was indoctrinated in
  the faith in a very rigid manner in my childhood, I had very little idea about
  the ‘real Islam.’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just like
  most Bangladeshis, I thought Islam to be peaceful, tolerant, and very positive
  towards women. After the Iranian revolution, I read a lot about Islam. The
  advent of Internet brought me the greatest opportunity to learn about Islam in
  a short period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I scanned
  innumerable essays in various Islamic web sites written by Islamic scholars
  mostly residing in the Western countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Their essays on women gave an impression that Islam has many goodies
  for them. Like an ordinary gullible Muslim, I also believed in whatever they
  wrote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then I found a great
  discrepancy in what these Islamic scholars (read Islamists) wrote and the
  unspeakable barbarity and gross unfairness perpetrated on the women in the
  Islamic paradises like, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and certain parts of
  Nigeria and Malaysia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
  present trend continues, then, soon Bangladesh would be in the list of Islamic
  paradises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought about my
  aging mother. I thought about my working sisters. I thought about my loving
  wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was greatly distressed
  when I thought of what could happen to these dearest relations of my life if
  Bangladesh goes Islamic and Allah’s laws (read Sharia) are enforced in
  Bangladesh. This forced me to dig deeper and deeper into Islam and especially
  the Sharia provision/s for women. I made a microscopic dissection of Islam
  from its very root. What I found was shocking. Sometimes, I just could not
  believe what I was reading. Thus, I completely discarded the explanations,
  apologies, <i>and tafsirs</i> from the erudite Islamic scholars and started to
  use my own brain, common sense, and judgment to find the truth. After I found
  the ‘real Islam’, I could not look straight into the eyes of my mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I could not sit comfortably with my sisters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I could not be at ease with my wife. I was forced to pick up the pen
  (read keyboard) to tell all the mothers, sisters, and wives of Islamic faith
  what Sharia/Islam means for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
  must let our women folk know the truth about the treatment of Islamic women
  before many so called ‘moderate’ Muslim countries bring this <i>Trojan
  Horse</i> into their lives and become another Afghanistan, Iran, or the
  Northern parts of Nigeria and Malaysia. As I write, I heard the news that a
  Nigerian woman would be stoned to death after her newly born so called
  illegitimate daughter is weaned, probably after a period of two years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Please think of this barbarity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please
  remember your mother, remember your sisters and your loving wife when you read
  this essay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Won’t you?<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#008000">This
  essay is quite lengthy. I apologize for writing such a prolix article, but I
  could not help it. No matter how much I tried, I could not shorten further. It
  had to be very lengthy, for there is so much to tell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>For convenience, I have divided the essay in 7 (seven parts).&nbsp;<O:P>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366"></O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">To begin with, let us start with the unfairness of Allah
  towards women.<span style="TEXT-TRANSFORM: uppercase"><O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <h1><b>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </b></h1>
  <h4><b>Allah prefers men and you know it!</b>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The interdependency of men and women is recognized in
  Islam. This is because of the importance of women as a preserver of human
  species.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, a thorough
  examination of Qur’an, ahadith and the Islamic Sharia clearly demonstrates
  the heavy bias of Allah towards men.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Why men are considered superior?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It is because of their physical strength, financial ability to pay
  dower and to spend on women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  Qur’an is very clear about the superiority of men over women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Let us review a few verses from Qur’an to demonstrate this fact.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  </font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Men
  have a degree over women...2:228</b>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </font></span><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366"></O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="002.228"><em>002.228</em></a><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves for
  three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath
  created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And
  their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they
  wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the rights
  against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of
  advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This verse establishes the supremacy of men over women,
  although Qur’an ambiguously claims to bestow similar rights for both men and
  women. This verse never mentions what those rights are; neither do we find the
  clarification on this matter in the entire Qur’an. Therefore, a variety of
  interpretation can be made out of this verse. This verse can really be used to
  justify anything that a man can find convenient to establish his superiority
  over women. Of course, the Islamic apologists take this opportunity to make
  Qur’an look very fair and non-discriminatory to women. It could be true that
  Muhammad really wanted to see some improvement of status of women in Arabia
  during his time. However, he was reluctant to enforce a radical change for
  fear of a backlash from the male dominated Arab society. This verse may look a
  little benign for it does mention about certain rights of women although not
  being so specific. To see the real Islamic treatment of women we need to look
  elsewhere.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Let us examine the following verse up close:&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  </font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Men
  are protectors and maintainers of women; women must be devoutly obedient, if
  not then beat them...4:34</span></b></font></p>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
  <p><a name="004.034"><em><span lang="EN-AU">004.034</span></em></a><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> Men are the protectors and maintainers of women,
  because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because
  they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly
  obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them
  guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct,
  admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat
  them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means
  (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all).&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The above verse is quite clear about the superiority of
  men over women. The verse is lucid in telling the reason for the superiority
  of men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is because of their
  physical strength and their ability to support women financially.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Islamists often use this divine decree to justify the subjugation of
  women in Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But their logic
  falls flat if we recognize today’s reality that physical size and strength
  does not mean a thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
  animals are much stronger physically than men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>How about an elephant?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An
  elephant is hugely stronger than a man is but that does not make it superior
  to a human.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, a woman
  may be weaker in physical strength (with proper training a woman can be as
  strong as any man, if not more) but her physical weakness, in no way make her
  inferior to men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Financial
  dependence?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This could be true
  for some ancient societies; but surely not true any more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We have many examples of single women leading a financially independent
  happy life. There are plenty of single mums (either widowed, divorced or
  unmarried) who steadfastly support her family without the help of any man.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This verse also prescribes physical punishment for
  disobedient women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I shall write
  more on Islamic wife beating later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why
  does God have to prescribe this torture on wives?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Isn’t it because men make women dependent on them?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Imagine what would happen to a man if he were completely dependent on a
  woman for his financial support?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Will
  he dare to raise his hand against her?&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU">Please note the comment (lightly) inserted by the
  translator Yusuf Ali. He deliberately did this keeping in mind that beating is
  a gross indecency and a criminal offence in western societies. His purpose of
  translation of Qur’an was primarily aimed at the western people and the
  non-Muslims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That is why he
  softens Qur’an from its extremely harsh statements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The original Qur’an and the translation by other authors do not
  contain the comment<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(slightly)
  insert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here is the translation
  of Pickthal and Shakir. While Pickthal translates to whip women, Shakir
  translates as plain beating without specifying the method.</span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU"><strong>PICKTHAL:</strong> Men are in charge of women,
  because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they
  spend of their property (for the support of women). So good women are the
  obedient, guarding in secret that which Allah hath guarded. As for those from
  whom ye fear rebellion, admonish them and banish them to beds apart, and
  scourge them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way against them. Lo! Allah is
  ever High, Exalted, Great.</span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
  <strong>SHAKIR:</strong> Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has
  made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their
  property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah
  has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish
  them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they
  obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great.</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">When Qur’an treats women in such a disgraceful manner,
  one may wonder why almighty Allah created women after all. Was it not better
  to have no woman at all?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually,
  Qur’an does not really know the reason for creation of women because
  Qur’an is not really from God. Muhammad himself with the help of a few of
  his scribes wrote it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
  in Qur’an we simply find the mention of what people believed in those days
  regarding the creation of human albeit in a new format.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Here is the verse that tells the reason for the creation
  of women&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  </font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">God
  created us from a single person and made mate of like nature; pregnancy is a
  light burden to women...7:189</span></b></font></p>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
  <p><em><span lang="EN-AU">007.189</span></em><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> It is He Who created you from a single person, and
  made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her (in love).
  When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about
  (unnoticed). When she grows heavy, they both pray to Allah their Lord,
  (saying): &quot;If Thou givest us a goodly child, we vow we shall (ever) be
  grateful.&quot;<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">The verse is rather very ambiguous. It says that God
  created a single person first. What was the sex of that single person?
  Islamists often use this verse to portray the sexual equality of Islam and how
  Islam differs from the Christianity and Judaism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In the Bible God says that He created Adam first then He created Eve
  from Adam’s rib.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do not be
  fooled by this simple-minded interpretation of the Islamists. The key word in
  this verse is ‘you’. Who is this ‘you’ that God seems to be talking
  to. Is it a man or a woman?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Remember,
  whom did God reveal the Qur’an? It was not a woman but a man. Moreover,
  elsewhere in the Hadith we read that women were created from a rib that is why
  they are crooked (See Shahih Muslim<span style="COLOR: red"> </span>8.3467).
  Therefore, the meaning of this verse is no different from the verse in the
  Bible. In this verse, the Qur’an says that women were created to give
  companion and pleasure to men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please
  take a moment to read and think about the meaning of this verse once again. We
  do not really need exegesis/mullahs/Islamists to tell us the “Real” <i>Tafsir</i>
  of this verse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Simple common
  sense tells us that God created women to give men companionship and pleasure
  and to bear children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>God did not
  create women as his primary reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
  may conclude that God made women on second thought to alleviate the loneliness
  and the dullness for men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Women
  were merely created for men’s sensuous pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Pure and simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
  obvious from the following verse.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  </font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">God

  <p><em><span lang="EN-AU">030.021</span></em><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> And among His Signs is this, that He created for
  you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them,
  and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs
  for those who reflect.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Does this
  verse seem to be contradicting the previous verse (7:189)?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Of course, it does.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
  verse seems to suggest that God created women for men and vice versa. That is
  to say, God created two persons, and not one as was suggested in the previous
  (7:189) verse. Doesn’t it? Who was created first?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Man or the woman?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely,
  God did not create men to give pleasure and tranquillity to women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It was the woman who was created for men. Thus, from the very beginning
  of creation of human we see the unfairness of God. Not only that God created
  woman as a second thought but also he burdened her with the task of child
  bearing. One may legitimately ask, ‘Why? Why God has to put women in such a
  burdensome position?’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  answer, if we go by the Islamic rule, is a simple one. Only God knows the
  answer. And that’s all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it
  is not that difficult to ponder on the real reason. All religious books are
  written by men (religionists say that they are the messages sent by God
  through His postman like Gabriel).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
  is, then a simple matter to realize that these prophets of God could never
  displease men by giving them a secondary position (like women) in the process
  of creation. Therefore, the women must accept without question the superiority
  of men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, pregnancy and
  giving birth are dirty/painful jobs that fit only slaves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Doesn’t it make sense to realize that when these ‘messengers of
  God’ wrote their holy scriptures they viewed women as nothing more than
  sexual pleasures and slaves to carry the burden of sex (pregnancy)? Read the
  ancient history of Arabia that will confirm of what I have written.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Can you then guess what would have been the story of
  creation of Adam and Eve if God’s messengers were women?&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Another reason given by Qur’an as to why God prefers
  men is simply laughable. Have a look at the following verse.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  </font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Men
  love to purify themselves…9:108</span></b></font></p>
  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#003366">
  <p><a name="009.108"><em><span lang="EN-AU">009.108</span></em></a><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> Never stand thou forth therein. There is a mosque
  whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety; it is more worthy of
  the standing forth (for prayer) therein. In it are men who love to be
  purified; and Allah loveth those who make themselves pure.</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In this verse, the Qur’an says that God prefers men
  because they (the men) love to purify themselves. Are we then to assume that
  the women does not know how to purify/cleanse themselves?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In other words, are women unclean?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Of course, the apologists will say that the meaning of purify means
  spiritual/mystical, sublime etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere
  in the verse, it says what is the meaning of purification. It could be both
  spiritual as well as physical (meaning ablution before prayer). Let us take
  examples from the real world. Are there differences in
  cleanliness/purification between men and women?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The answer is ‘No.’ Then, why should Qur’an use such inane
  argument to justify the divine superiority of men?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Some may say that the verse did not say that the women do not know how
  to purify; it simply says that God loves those men who go to the mosque and
  purify themselves. This argument is simply not unacceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Are not women allowed in the mosque?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If it is so, then the unfairness of God becomes more inexcusable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Why does God blatantly show his preference for men when both sexes are
  equally praying in the mosque?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Isn’t
  it a kind of religious apartheid?&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This kind of Islamic bias for men is again demonstrated
  in the following verse.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  </font>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Men

  </span>We shall, later in this article, see that women are equally commanded
  by God to go for Jihad and lay down their lives, if required. Why then God has
  a clear bias for men? Does not God trust women believers regarding their
  truthfulness and fealty in faith?<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Only men receive revelation from God&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The Qur’an and God are absolutely adamant that only men
  are capable of handling revelations from God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>God always sends revelations to men. Thus, we have all the prophets to
  be men. God has never selected a woman as a prophet and in future also, he
  will not do so. Here are two verses that demonstrate amply this unreasonable
  desire of God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Have you ever
  wondered what would have God decided if women were financially strong in the
  Arabian Desert?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What would have
  God chosen? Do you remember many extant tribal societies where the women ruled
  supreme?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wonder why God
  overlooked them.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">For more unfairness of God, look at the following verses.&nbsp;<O:P>

  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU">Let us briefly review those three verses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In 12.109 God says that he had never sent any messenger before Muhammad
  who was not a man. Muslims believe that Muhammad is the last prophet and
  messenger from God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
  the natural conclusion is that there will never ever be woman messenger from
  God.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In verse 16:43, God confirms
  his commitment of selecting only men as his messenger before Muhammad was
  selected to be his Prophet and messenger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This is to say that God had never selected a woman in the past to be
  his messenger. In 22:75, God confuses us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This time he says that he sometimes chooses men and sometimes chooses
  angels as his messengers. We have heard the name of a few messengers of God
  including Muhammad. Who were the angels sent as messengers? Was it Gabriel,
  Michael, Azazil, Azrael, Malik, Harut or Marut? Or does God mean that men and
  angels are at the same level in the eyes of God as far as the reception of his
  messages are concerned? Why were women excluded from the list of angels?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This, too, is answered in the following verse.</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Men

  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Well, the above verse tells it all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Men are simply miles ahead in the worshipping of God than the women
  folks. Need no further explanation.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Here is a hadith that tells us that there never were
  perfect women although there were many perfect men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Since God is the only authority who reserves the right to bestow
  perfection to whomever he pleases, we must, therefore, conclude that only men
  are given perfection and not women no matter how much they (the women) may
  try.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perfection by women is
  simply out of question.&nbsp;<O:P>

  foods.</span>&nbsp;<O:P>

  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Having established the indisputable superiority of men,
  God now elevates a man to the position of a kind of smaller god in the eyes of
  women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here is what Islam thinks
  a woman should do for a man.<br>
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A man is next to God for a woman</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">This concept of absolute superiority of men in Islam
  is very similar to the Hindu practice. In Hinduism, women are asked to worship
  their husbands as <i>Devota</i> (demi God). Islam is no different on this. A
  woman’s single purpose in life is to please her husband. Nothing is holier
  than this. In fact, if a woman were required to worship any one other than God
  it would be her husband. In <i>hadith </i>we read:&nbsp;<O:P>

  <p class="MsoNormal">If a woman is to prostrate to another person (besides
  Allah) it will be her husband.</p>

  I said: I went to al-Hirah and saw them prostrating themselves before a satrap
  of theirs, but you have most right, Apostle of Allah, to have (people)
  prostrating themselves before you. He said: Tell me , if you were to pass my
  grave, would you prostrate yourself before it? I said: No. He then said: Do
  not do so. If I were to command anyone to make prostration before another I
  would command women to prostrate themselves before their husbands, because of
