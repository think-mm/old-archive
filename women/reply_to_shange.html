<p>I choose not to give any details but as a child I was sexually abused for 
many years. (not by my father. I have to say that because everyone assumes it 
and he is a good man.) I struggled with issues of hatred and self loathing for 
many years and I failed out of college and married a man who had no respect for 
me. I started feeling better when I stopped feeling sorry for myself and stopped 
wasting my time hating those who may have done me wrong. I got divorced, became 
a firefighter, went back to college, and met a man who thinks I hung the moon in 
the sky. I can honestly say that I have no regrets. My experiences are what made 
me who I am and I wouldn't change a bit of it. I am not saying that everyone 
should go through what I did, nor am I saying that my life couldn't have been 
worse. The thing is that life sometimes deals you a bad hand, but many a game 
has been won on a bad hand. What I am saying is that if I continued to feel 
constant rage and hatred and self pity, I would not be as happy as I am now. I 
am not saying you should trust every man you meet with no thought for your own 
safety, but to think horrible thoughts about them only tortures your soul, not 
the souls of those who deserve it. My reply to this Poem is called:</p>

<p><font color="#000080">&nbsp;Every 3 minutes a woman is adored, every five minutes 
a woman is kissed <br>
every ten minutes a little girl is lifted onto the<br>
shoulders of a loving uncle yet I rode the subway<br>
&nbsp;today I sat next to an old man who may have given his old wife<br>
flowers 3<br>
&nbsp;minutes ago or 3 days/30 years ago he might have taken his<br>
daughter out for ice cream<br>
&nbsp;but I sat there cuz the men on the train might help some young<br>
women<br>
&nbsp;later in the day or tomorrow and I might shut my door too fast to<br>
say thank you<br>
&nbsp;every 3 minutes it happens some women's laughter rushes to<br>
&nbsp;her husbands ears/pours from her mouth like the itsy bitsy bells on<br>
her babies toys<br>
&nbsp;her mouth smiling /every three minutes a baby girl is found in her<br>
fathers arms while he smiles at her tiny toes and tiny fingers<br>
wrapped around his own.<br>
&nbsp;I rode the subway today<br>
&nbsp;and bought a paper from an east Indian man who might have held his<br>
&nbsp;lady tight and told her he loved her while she mourned the passing<br>
of her mother/ I didn't know maybe he watches little<br>
&nbsp;girls in the park and remembers his own girl before she grew up <br>
&nbsp;I bought the paper looking for the announcement there<br>
&nbsp;has to be an announcement of the man who found the missing girl at<br>
the zoo and reunited her with her parents<br>
&nbsp;I sat in a restaurant with my paper looking for the<br>
&nbsp;announcement a young man served me coffee I wondered did he pour<br>
a glass of wine with a dinner served for his wifes promotion as he<br>
smiled at her with pride<br>
<br>
&nbsp;There is some concern that battered women might start to hate all<br>
other men<br>
&nbsp;&quot;with no immediate cause&quot;<br>
&nbsp;They will spit up screaming with all happiness taken from them and<br>
no room for love...only hate<br>
every day women find men who are loving and fair and good.</font></p>
