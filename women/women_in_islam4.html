  men’s side and make no mistake about it!<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Islam has shocked
  the world with the its best kept secret, that is, Sharia laws, especially its
  provision on matters of sex, marriage, gender rights, polygamy…etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Islamists are dying to enact these barbaric laws wherever they see
  their potential of success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A few
  of the once secular countries (such as Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan, and
  certain parts of Malaysia and Nigeria) have come under these medieval,
  uncivilized, barbaric rules of Islamic Sharia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Words fail to describe the inhumane, tormenting, and mind boggling
  cruelty and despicable provisions contained in the Sharia laws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>More importantly, this Sharia has totally robbed the Muslim women of
  whatever little rights they could exercise during the ‘decadent’ secular
  rules.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The worst and the largest
  victim of Sharia had been the women, unquestionably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Quite often, we find a woman is to be stoned to death for being raped
  by criminals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A victim is to be
  executed for the crime committed by the culprits!!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This is what is ‘true’ Islamic justice.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Why is it so?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Isn’t Islamic justice the perfect justice system on earth?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>After all, the Sharia is Allah’s laws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Allah could never do such abominable injustice to women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>What a load of rubbish!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sharia
  is designed to protect men all the way. Through and through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It is simply because tyrannical men who call themselves prophets of God
  wrote those laws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Didn’t they?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>That is precisely why Sharia is always and will always remain on
  men’s side when it comes to sex, family, matrimonial—any matter where both
  sexes are involved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In making
  Sharia, these prophets never consulted women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Imagine what would be the provisions of Sharia if the prophets were
  women and not men.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Here I am citing a
  few examples of the bias of Sharia for men. </span><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Men can punish rebellious wives by
  beating them. However, a woman cannot punish a rebellious husband in a similar
  manner. If the man is cruel then the woman must seek to please him and
  compromise with him as per verse 4:128&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Men are greedy; if women fear cruelty
  from men then they can make an amicable settlement...4:128</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span lang="EN-AU">004.128</span></em><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her
  husband's part, there is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable
  settlement between themselves; and such settlement is best; even though men's
  souls are swayed by greed. But if ye do good and practise self-restraint,
  Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.<O:P>

  her (Shahih Bukhari 7.62.134)</span></p>

  the Verse: 'If a wife fears cruelty or desertion on her husband's part ...')
  (4.128) It concerns the woman whose husband does not want to keep her with him

  him: 'Keep me and do not divorce me, and then marry another woman, and you may
  neither spend on me, nor sleep with me.' This is indicated by the Statement of
  Allah: 'There is no blame on them if they arrange an amicable settlement
  between them both, and (such) settlement is better.&quot; (4.128)</span></p>

  <h4>Polygamy by men is divine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Don’t
  we know this already?<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Many Islamic
  writers take great pride to announce to the world that Islam was the only
  religion that put a limit on the number of wives that a man can have at any
  given time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They always cite very
  ancient, biblical customs when many men used to have unlimited wives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>They even go one step further in saying that ‘actually Islam promotes
  monogamy since Qur’an says that it is impossible to be fair with all the
  wives—and that is a requirement by Allah to have multiple wives, therefore,
  it is not possible to have more than one wife at any time’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>What a convoluted logic!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
  a primary school kid will laugh when this type of inane argument is presented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Another issue they always try to avoid is that they never talk about
  the modern secular matrimonial laws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
  are always living in the past --very distant past indeed, at least a few
  thousand years behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A further
  tactic used by these “erudite” Islamic scholars is that they will exhort
  hundreds of virtues of polygamy when asked why they do not compare their rules
  with secular ones.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">What a bizarre
  situation. Think of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At one
  point, they are adamant that monogamy is the way to go—and Islam is actually
  for monogamous marriage. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>At the
  same time, just like a chameleon they quickly change color to eulogize
  polygamy for infinite reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
  will even tell you that the best cure for today’s promiscuous society is
  actually the practice of polygamy by men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>According to them, polygamy is a divine provision for men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It is because men, by nature, desire to have multiple sex partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>So, instead of turning to the prostitutes for this excess libido, they
  should marry more women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
  about multiple husbands at any time by a woman?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Does not women also desire to have sex with many men?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Nope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Allah is absolutely against this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Have any Islamist
  ever asked any woman on this matter?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
  they have not, then let me say that the desire to have sex with multiple
  partners is equally strong in women as it is with men if not more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Have a look at nature. You will see plenty of examples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In fact, prehistoric societies were matriarchal where a woman was the
  center of everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She used to
  have many sex partners without any problem just as Islamic men have multiple
  wives today. &nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Can we not,
  therefore, conclude that Islamic polygamy is just a sexist phenomenon, unfair
  and an utterly illogical provision on the pretext of enforcing divine
  sanction?<O:P>
  </O:P>
  &nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Let us look at
  some of the provisions of Islamic polygamy in the Holy Scriptures.</span><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Four free women wives (some say nine)
  at a time and any number of slave girls are permitted...4:3</span></p>
  <p><a name="004.003"><em><span lang="EN-AU">004.003</span></em></a><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly
  with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye
  fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or
  (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to
  prevent you from doing injustice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU">People with very little knowledge of Islam often think
  that the provision of four wives at any time is all that Islam allows for
  having multiple sex partners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perish
  this thought. The reality is that a Muslim man can have sex with as many women
  as his heart desires at any time whether through marriage or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In fact, the holy man of Islam, Imam Hasan had up to 300 wives, believe
  it or not (more on this will be found in a subsequent section). Besides four
  legal wives at any one time, Islam permits a man to have unlimited number of
  concubines as long as they are slave women or captive women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>More on sex with captive women will be found in a later part of this
  essay.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">So, Muslim men, rejoice! You do not
  need to carry the burden of four wives. When Islam takes over the world,
  slavery will be re-introduced. Slave markets will be re-established in all the
  important parts of the world. If you are tired with your old wives, then just
  go to the nearest slave market and buy a slave-girl/s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Have sex with her for as long or as much as you like, then when you are
  tired of her, you can sell her off to recover your principal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>All you need to do is to feed and cloth the sex-slave for the duration
  of your desire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See, how
  beautiful the Islamic rule is!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
  free unlimited sex is also possible with captive women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Where can you get captive women in today’s world?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If you think that this is impossible, then you have not understood
  Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Remember, when the Jihadis
  conquer the Western countries, all non-Muslim women there become their
  captives, at least in theory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  Jihadis then can distribute them to all the Muslim residents and among
  themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then they can enjoy
  these petite infidel women to their hearts content.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This is the provision of Allah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
  Iran and the Taliban controlled Afghanistan, the Mullahs did just that.
  Whenever, an atheist, secular, socialist, communist woman was captured for
  waging war against God, she was given to a prison guard to use her as he
  pleased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The guard made sure that
  he had sexually enjoyed her before she is executed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Unbelievable, huh?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>See (<a href="http://www.homa.org/wings/irisituation.html">http://www.homa.org/wings/irisituation.html</a>
  )</span></p>
  <p><span lang="EN-AU">Here is Holy Scripture on sex with slaves and captives.</span></p>

  </span>Why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that
  the Islamists have a secret agenda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">So, what price a
  man should pay a woman to have an Islamic marriage (read for sexual
  intercourse)? Surprisingly, it is not that expensive. There is a minimum mahr
  that can be as little as a pair of shoes (Ref: 9, p163). And there is no limit
  to the maximum. It is even possible to contract an Islamic marriage without
  paying any money or any object of pecuniary value. If a woman agrees then a
  man can marry in exchange for reciting a verse from the Quran (Ref: 9, pp163,
  164). Sex from a woman could be as cheap as that.<O:P>
