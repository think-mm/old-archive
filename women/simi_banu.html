  <p>There appears to be a negative feeling pervading this country these days.
  There's no improvement in the law and order situation, every other day we get
  to hear of different and new types of atrocities visited upon religious
  minorities (as if the perpetrators have entered some macabre contest), the
  regular wave of rapes, dowry killings and acid throwing go on and
  on…Sometimes it's as if I am shut up in a room whose walls are gradually
  closing in, cutting off my air, cutting off my life.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>So instead of thinking of all the things that is wrong with my country, my
  people, instead of thinking about all the disappointments and all the
  indignities that I have been through because I am a woman living in a third
  world country where to a frightening extent my gender determines who and what
  I am, I will think of good things. I will think of the things that I should be
  grateful for.<br>
  <br>

    <p><font color="#000080">That even though we sometimes do not get the chance

    no one has dared to tell me that I do not have the right be there<br>
    That even though I (too) once slapped a man in public,<br>
    no one told me that I could not do so because I was a woman,<br>
    that he had the right to beat me up because I was a woman<br>

  <p><b>These are my blessings, the things I am grateful for.</b><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>But above all, today, I feel grateful that I am not a young woman named
  called <b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">Simi</span></b>, who was
  abused systematically to a point beyond all human endurance, that I am not a
  girl who was made to feel that there was no one to help her, there was no one
  there for her, a girl whom tragically her society as well as her state had
  failed to protect, a girl who had felt so desperately, so inhumanly alone in
  the world that the only response she could make to it was to choose death.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Since childhood I have been taught that suicide is an act of supreme
  cowardice -- that suicide is chosen as an easy way out by those who lack the
  courage of facing life. <font color="#ff0000">For a long time I held that
  tenet to be true. But Simi's suicide has forced me to rethink that easy
  categorization.</font></b><br>
  <br>
  As women, our whole lives are a process of being stripping of our power, our
  identity. As we progress in life, the process of making us more and more
  dependent on others, of having other people decide for us, of other people
  determining who we are and what we are continues - until all we are is
  someone's daughter or someone's wife or someone's mother; until we are no one
  and nothing by ourselves and the only way we can be identified is in relation
  to someone else. There are a few of us who resist that process, who try to
  face our lives on our own terms, those who take the supreme step of trying to
  decide/determine who we are by ourselves. Not by rejecting society, and not by
  rejecting what norms society forces us to, but by adapting ourselves to
  society and in the process forcing society adapt to us. And through our acts
  of self determination - we change society.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>And that is what society fears abysmally - the women who take control; the
  women who bring change. Simi was one of those. She had exercised her right of
  choosing. Instead of merely conforming to the mold of what a &quot;good&quot;
  girl, a &quot;nice&quot; girl is, she chose to be herself. Therefore, society
  visited its horrors upon her in the persons of those undisciplined boys who
  harassed her, the self righteous neighbors and the morally superior policeman.
  What they were truly condemning was not just her way of life, but the
  presumption she had made in daring to choose a way of life for herself.<br>
  <br>
  <b>I don't believe that by committing suicide Simi was just taking the easy
  way out. Simi's suicide was her final determination of her identity, of her
  life. She had chosen her way of life. And when the time came when that right
  of choice was threatened, she again took control of her life --by choosing
  death. The society that judged and condemned her could presume to seize
  control of her life - she would not allow it to take control of her death.</b><br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>So, finally, being a woman, living in Bangladesh, what are the good
  things, what really are my blessings?</b> I am still blessed with the
  privilege of breathing; I have had to make hard choices in my life - but never
  have I been faced with as hard a choice as Simi had. I am alive - as a
  Bangladeshi woman this is my ultimate blessing - perhaps the greatest of my
  blessings but also the worst.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><font color="#ff0000"><b>I wonder if Simi was counting her blessings when
  she finally fell asleep.</b></font></p>

  Thoughts</font></h1>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;<b><font color="#800080" size="4">By Lopa Tasneem</font></b></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#800080" size="4">E-mail: <a href="mailto:lopa_saleh@yahoo.com">lopa_saleh@yahoo.com</a>&nbsp;</font></b></p>
  <font color="#008080">
  <p><font color="darkred">Even though I raise this question with an&nbsp;ailing
  heart&nbsp;whether there is a future&nbsp;for women in Bangladesh or not when
  I hear stories like Simi's suicide, I would like to be an optimist. I would
  like to think that the future women of Bangladesh would be strong enough to
  fight all injustices perpetrated against them and not choose the path of
  suicide to protest. Neither suicide nor taking up arms in one's hand should be
  the language of women's protest against any social injustice. Those&nbsp;might
  temporarily solve the issue, but to&nbsp;seek a long-lasting solution, we need
  to search our souls first to see what is the root cause of these injustices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p><font color="darkred">I do not&nbsp;observe much change in the mind-set of
  women, more&nbsp;acutely and specifically&nbsp;among the mind-set of Bengali
  middle class women. The same old stories: worries of the mother of an
  unmarried girl and arranged marriages of girls&nbsp;to men twice their age. I
  do not&nbsp;sense much hope when I learn that my young feminist friend's
  family pressures her to leave her work in order to get married and settled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>As long as women elect to remain the weaker sex and succumb to the
  myriads of society's unfairness, there will be more stories like Simi's.</font></p>
  <p><font color="darkred">The solution, IMO,&nbsp;lies in education and
  financial independence for women. It might take several generations of
  education for women before they&nbsp;would&nbsp;recognize an injustice as an
  injustice against women. But the protest has to come from within first. As
  long as our womenfolk do not realize that marriage and family cannot be the
  ultimate goal of a girl, we would remain in the dark. When the mothers will
  teach their sons to learn to better respect women, only then we would see the
  number of abusive men decrease. We create this social awareness through
  education. The women need to realize first that the society has been unfair to
  them and one way of protest would be to become financially independent so that
  they can take full control of their own lives. Until then, we need keep our
  struggle alive.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="darkred">The Police inspector Abul Bashar
  who blamed Simi instead of punishing the hoodlums does not come as a surprise
  to me. We face many Abul Bashars at home and on the streets in our everyday
  life. In a traditional, patriarchic society like ours, Abul Bashars who may
  quote religion to their advantage are quite normal. There is not much
  difference between the mind-set of the hoodlums and that of the police
  inspector in respect to their thoughts of women,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>as our society does not teach&nbsp;us that women should enjoy equal
  rights as men. It can be very frustrating for the women at times, especially
  when our own parents blame us too for going against the norm. Most of the
  times, we make compromises by giving up the fight. Our mothers teach us to
  compromise on every steps. They tell us that women are meant to be the weaker,
  inferior sex. We get brainwashed by our mothers, aunts, friends.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="darkred">We, the women need to educate
  ourselves first to collectively realize that we are mistreated by the society
  and therefore, need to protest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We,
  also, should educate a son like Abul Bashar regarding women's place in the
  society and a daughter like Simi to stand up on her own feet. That will
  require several generations of&nbsp;proper education. But&nbsp;we, the women
  need to start the process.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="darkred">Financial independence will give
  women the power – power to make their voices heard. Women need to become
  government officials, business entrepreneurs, doctors, engineers, political
  leaders, artists, teachers equally with men to have the power to reform the
  society. We can create such mass awareness only when we have the power to do
  it.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="darkred">Simi was an under-graduate student
  and perhaps, was working towards achieving her financial independence. The
  achievement of financial independence would have led her to&nbsp;take full
  control of her life when she would not have to listen to the parents or a
  husband if she chose to be so. She might have been all alone in her journey
  and I can, very well, feel her pain. Still, I would like to think that other
  Simis would not put such an untimely stoppage to their journey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Simis would come out united and keep their struggle alive. The sun has
  to come out after the stormy nights!<O:P>
