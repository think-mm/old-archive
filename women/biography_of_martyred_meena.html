<font color="darkred" size="3"><strong>Biography of martyred Meena, founding 
leader of RAWA <br>
</strong></font><br>
<br>
MEENA (1957-1987) was born in Kabul. During her school days, students in Kabul 
and other Afghan cities were deeply engaged in social activism and rising mass 
movements. She left the university to devote herself as a social activist to 
organizing and educating women. In pursuit of her cause for gaining the right of 
freedom of expression and conducting political activities, Meena laid the 
foundation of RAWA in 1977. This organization was meant to give voice to the 
deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan. She started a campaign against the 
Russian forces and their puppet regime in 1979 and organized numerous 
processions and meetings in schools, colleges and Kabul University to mobilize 
public opinion. Another great service rendered by! ! ! her for the Afghan women 
is the launching of a bilingual magazine, Payam-e-Zan (Women's Message) in 1981. 
Through this magazine RAWA has been projecting the cause of Afghan women boldly 
and effectively. Payam-e-Zan has constantly exposed the criminal nature of 
fundamentalist groups. Meena also established Watan Schools for refugee 
children, a hospital and handicraft centers for refugee women in Pakistan to 
support Afghan women financially. At the end of 1981, by invitation of the 
French Government Meena represented the Afghan resistance movement at the French 
Socialist Party Congress. The Soviet delegation at the Congress, headed by Boris 
Ponamaryev, shamefacedly left the hall as participants cheered when Meena 
started waving a victory sign. Besides France, she also visited several other 
European c! ! ! ountries and met their prominent personalities. Her active 
social work and effective advocacy against the views of the fundamentalists and 
the puppet regime provoked the wrath of the Russians and the fundamentalist 
forces alike and she was assassinated by agents of KHAD (Afghanistan branch of 
KGB) and their fundamentalist accomplices in Quetta, Pakistan, on February 
4,1987.<br>

<strong>Translation of a part of a poem by Meena <br>
</strong><br>
<strong><font color="crimson">I'LL NEVER RETURN <br>
</font></strong><br>
<strong>I'm the woman who has awoken <br>
I've arisen and become a tempest through the <br>
ashes of my burnt children <br>
I've arisen from the rivulets of my <br>
brother's blood <br>
My nation's wrath has empowered me <br>
My ruined and burnt villages fill me with <br>
hatred against the enemy <br>
Oh compatriot, no longer regard me weak and <br>
incapable, <br>
My voice has mingled with thousands of <br>
arisen women <br>
My fists are clenched with fists of <br>
thousands compatriots <br>
To break all these sufferings all these <br>
fetters of slavery. <br>
I'm the woman who has awoken, <br>
I've found my path and will never return. <br>
