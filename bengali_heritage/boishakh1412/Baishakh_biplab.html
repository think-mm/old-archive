				Baishakh: Season of the poet</font><br>
				<font size="4" color="#000080">Biplab Pal<br>
				Anaheim, California </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Personal account of 
				childhood memories has always been fascinating to me. Especially 
				for its rich diversity of revelation of human feeling and 
				sensitivity. As the thermometer is hovering close to hundred in 
				Southern California, I can’t resist speaking a few words about 
				my fond childhood memories of ‘Baishakhi’ summer back in my 
				village town in Nadia. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Baishakh is the first 
				month in the Bengali calendar (~15 April-15May) and the hottest 
				month of the season. It is also the month of cultural festival 
				in Bengal as we celebrate the birth date of our greatest poet 
				Rabindra Nath Tagore who was born on 25th of Baishakh. I do not 
				know of any other country, any other race where people celebrate 
				the birth of a poet as their biggest festival. Besides Tagore, 
				there are Hindu cultural rituals as well—‘Gajan of Shiva’ (a 
				deadly tantric ritual for Shaivaite, I will come back on this 
				later), Radha-Krishna Lila Kirtan (Dancing of the 
				Baishanavites..the cult of love) and first day of business, 
				‘Hal-Khata: opening of business accounts) . From 25th Baishakh 
				to 22nd Shravan (death of Tagore) , approximately for three 
				months Bengal observes ‘Kabi Pakhya’ or ‘season of the poet’.<br>
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was growing up in a 
				small village town of Karimpur in the district of Nadia. Having 
				unique advantage of being located in high land, it was immune to 
				flooding and therefore, during my childhood, a lot of good 
				families were migrating to this small but beautiful river town. 
				My father built our house at the bank of Khare River (a tribute 
				of Jalangi). My early childhood memory is filled with the 
				seasonal change in and around the river. Bengal means 
				‘Bong+Aal~land+river’ , or in short, land of rivers. To feel its 
				meaning, one really needs to travel in Ganges delta where it is 
				difficult to find a place not within a few miles of any river. 
				Also, it is difficult to find a place in delta that does not get 
				flooded by the rivers in the rainy seasons. However, comes the 
				last month of spring, all the rivers along with all the ponds 
				and the lakes will be dried out. As the Baishakh would set in, 
				all I remember is cracked and sun dried river-bed and smell of 
				clay (‘Sendo Gandho’: not unfamiliar with Bay Area people, while 
				crossing Hayard Bridge in marsh land in summer). However, I used 
				to long for summer in my early childhood because clay mud in 
				summer river-bed is best for making clay sculpture. Since idol 
				worship is deeply rooted in Hindu culture, I had fascination for 
				making clay idols—not out of religious feeling but I guess, out 
				of childish curiosity to make something! Ganesh, the Hindu 
				semi-rat/elephant God was my favorite. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was so hot that 
				temperature will always be above hundred and therefore, most of 
				the schools will be running in the early morning to avoid hot 
				afternoon. So to us, summer means a free afternoon to steal 
				ripening mangos, licchis, jack fruits etc. from other’s garden. 
				Typically most of the fruit garden used to have security and you 
				have to operate in group with orchestrated effort to for such 
				misadventure. Cultural festivals for ‘RabindraJayanti’ or ‘birth 
				day celebration for poet Tagore’ would be close by and we would 
				gear up for recitation, drama, songs and dance! </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Poet Tagore wrote around 
				eighteen hundred songs, couple of thousands of poetry, numerous 
				dramas and composed several dances for his songs. At childhood, 
				it was difficult to understand the meaning of his songs except 
				for a few simple ones. I was not the most sought after person 
				for such functions as my seniors found me void of talent for any 
				cultural event: I was horribly stiff in acting; my pronunciation 
				was below the purity level of recitation and I was a rejected 
				soul in music and dancing. After a lot of begging, I used to 
				earn small roles! I was definitely jealous of those who were 
				very popular and sought after celebrity of the town for their 
				performance in music and dance. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Celebration of Tagore 
				continues for three months, from his birth date of 25th Boishakh 
				to 22nd Shravan, date of his earthly demise. These three months 
				are known as ‘Kabi Pakhya’ or ‘ Season of the Poet’. All the 
				local communities will be making their own celebration for a day 
				or two (sometimes for a week). Typically, schedules are arranged 
				with mutual discussions with other communities so that no two 
				communities conduct their celebration at the same time – to 
				maximize audience in a small town. No matter what, the airs and 
				the skies will be filled up with the music of ‘ Esho he Baishakh, 
				esho esho’ “ Hail the month of Baishakh! Come and fill our 
				life”. Celebrations may be disrupted in some of the nights, 
				devastated by ‘Nor Wester’ a cyclonic thunder storm that chills 
				out the temperature drastically! </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">25th Baishakhi morning 
				is a special day. We will get up very early in the morning and 
				start attending the procession in traditional Bengali attire. In 
				front of the procession, there will be a big photo of Tagore and 
				we will all sing his songs while marching across the town. I 
				don’t know of any place in the world where there is so much of 
				devotion and fire to celebrate the birth of a poet as their 
				biggest ritual! </font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is my moment to 
					part, <br>
					Swing the gates quickly my love, <br>
					Our eyes met, we smiled in joy, <br>
					We played games in light and dark, <br>
					It was all a happy dream <br>
					That vanished when we awoke .. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I hear the distant 
					music, <br>
					The touch of a world unknown <br>
					Keeps tugging at my heartstrings <br>
					That world is mine forever, <br>
					I am ready my Beloved, <br>
					Light my path, give me your hand, <br>
					Lift your veils of illusion..<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>

				</blockquote>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				Celebration of Tagore is confined within middle class literate 
				Bengalis. Lower section of people are just an audience, they 
				seldom participate in music and dancing as one needs to be 
				highly trained in such performance. None of the poor, who lives 
				by daily wages can afford such training and to them, such 
				festivals are nothing more than a source of entertainment. 
				Unlike in USA and in cities, most of the celebrations are 
				conducted in open air stages and everybody can attend it. The 
				most traditional stage for celebration of Tagore is under the 
				shadow of mango garden and in the morning. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To the larger section of 
				people, specially among the depressed section of the people, 
				Kirtan or a ritual dancing for the love of ‘Radha and Krishna’ ( 
				the Hindu God Krishna and his childhood sweetheart Radha) was 
				the most popular. Rhythm of dancing is formed around sixteen 
				words: </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“ Hare Krishna, Hare 
				Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare<br>
				Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.”<br>
				(Hare means we thy pray: Krishna and Rama are two most popular 
				Hindu Gods) </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dancing continues on the 
				ground for seventy two hours in a circle around the icons of 
				Radha and Krishna in their loving style without a break! 
				Sometimes, it may continue for more than a week. Typically a 
				group performs dancing for one hour and then other group takes 
				over. But central stage never remains empty and performing group 
				never leaves the stage till other group takes over. Such 
				performance does not need training but love &amp; compassion for 
				Krishna, the ultimate Hindu God! In the night they perform with 
				a theme from Krishna’s love life with Radha. We call it 
				‘Raslila’ or ‘Cult of love’. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Other popular festival 
				is Shiver Gajan or addiction of lord Shiva. Shiva is a pagan god 
				of mysticism from non-Aryan time. He is five thousand year old 
				phallus God for the pagans. In him they pray the fertility of 
				the society. People who follow such cult are generally called 
				Shaibite and section of them that performs black magic is called 
				Tantrik. Their mystic ritual is called Tantra. They want to 
				prove their extra-ordinary power obtained from the practice of 
				Tantra which very often leads to their death. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One such deadly practice 
				is ‘charka’ (circle) during Gajan. Before the eyes of thousands 
				of devotees, back of one of the Tantrik will be pierced by a 
				‘Barshi’ ( a semi-circular sharp nail of steel) and will be 
				locked with his vertebrate. It is as horrible as if we have 
				caught a human fish by Barshi! Then he will be suspended through 
				rope of cloths from a tall column like a circular pendulum. 
				Before the cheering crowd, he will be set to swing in the air, 
				hanging like a pendulum. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To common people, it 
				looks like an inhumanely painful process as they see that muscle 
				from vertebrate gradually tear apart after few rotations. 
				However the devotee does not feel pain because typically he is 
				highly drugged with ‘Ganja’ for three months. Also he lives on 
				special diet for an year so that he becomes the man of skeleton 
				and bones. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many tantriks die later 
				while trying to be popular with such efforts to prove their 
				inhuman ‘Godly’ power. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Any account of Poila 
				Baishakh can not be complete without the memories of Hal Khata 
				or new account book for the shop owners. On the first day of 
				Baishakh, they invite all their customers for a small party and 
				customers also make a small payment towards their debt so that 
				the shop owner can open a new account book! I would always 
				accompany my father on Poila Baishakh to the local shops for 
				collecting sweet and snacks packets! </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Things back in my town 
				changed fast with high penetration of cable TV and booming of 
				hundreds of media channels. Kids don’t have time beyond school 
				books and TV programmes. Number of celebrations have fallen 
				drastically and that’s too a full days celebration of Tagore’s 
				birthday is becoming rarity. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Welcome to the era of 
				cultural homogeneity! </font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My life spilled over 
					with your love, sweetheart <br>
					You did not know, you did not know it's worth, <br>
					Like aroma of a hidden Rajanigandha <br>
					wafting in the dreams of night - <br>
					You filled my heart with your melody, <br>
					You did not know, you did not know, <br>
					you did not know that. <br>
					It's now time to part - <br>
					lift up, lift up your smiling face for once <br>
					As sweet death fills my life I leave at your feet <br>
					As mute nights of hidden passions end for one - <br>
					Whom you did not know, you did not know, <br>
					you did not know.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
