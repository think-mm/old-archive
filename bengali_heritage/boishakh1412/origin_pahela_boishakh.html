				<img height="86" alt="Pahela Baishakh" hspace="5" src="images.jpg" width="120" align="left" vspace="5">WE 
				celebrate Pahela Baishakh or the Bangla New Year's Day today. 
				Everything under the sun looks gay and cheerful and colourful, 
				one is suddenly struck by the beauty of the grass, the sky, the 
				trees - each and everything around looks pretty and radiates joy 
				and happiness. It seems that the tired and weary sun of 1405 
				that set last evening carried along with it all the gloom, all 
				the sorrows, all the melancholy and misery. Nothing that is 
				painful or dull or dreary is left for 1406, and the sun rising 
				with a new spirit and vigour this morning, rises in its full 
				glory, radiating nothing gloomy, nothing sad, nothing pensive 
				but only hope and happiness for the days to come. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pahela Baishakh is 
				indeed a momentous occasion in the life of each and every 
				Bengalee. It is the first day of Bangla calendar year. To every 
				Bengalee, young and old, rich and poor, wise and ignorant, it is 
				a time of gaiety to be celebrated with great merry-making, to be 
				enjoyed in every possible manner, an occasion which enables us, 
				in the words of Tennyson, to drink life to the lees.' It is a 
				cruel irony of fate that a few orthodox Muslims in our country, 
				shrouded by sheer ignorance, look down upon this Nababarsha 
				festival, simply because they inadvertently consider it to be a 
				festival of non-Muslim origin. But there is no shadow of doubt 
				that the Bangla calendar that we follow today was introduced by 
				the Muslims in this sub-continent. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Pahela Baishakh so 
				warmly celebrated all over the country today originated not from 
				Bangladesh, but from an entirely different part of this 
				sub-continent more than thousand miles away. What is more, the 
				Bangla Saal was introduced not by any Bangladeshi but by a 
				non-Bengalee in whose grandfather's vein flowed the blood of 
				both Gengis Khan and Tamerlane. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yes, what is popularly 
				known as Bangla Saal today saw the light of day through an 
				ordinance promulgated by Akbar the Great, the renowned grandson 
				of Zahiruddin Muhammad Babar whose mother and father were 
				descendants of Gengis Khan and Tamerlane respectively. It was to 
				immortalise a momentous occasion, a crucial juncture of history 
				that the great Moghul introduced this new system of calendar 415 
				years ago. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The calendar so 
				introduced was originally known as Tarikh-e-Elahi and it was 
				introduced on the 10th or the 11th March in the 29th year of 
				Akbar's reign i.e. in 1585 A. D. It , however, dates from the 
				day of Akbar's ascension to the throne of Delhi and commemorates 
				his coronation as the Emperor of India in 1556. The Second 
				Battle of Panipath and the Coronation of Akbar as the Emperor of 
				India are indeed great events in the annals of history. The 
				Moguls had nearly lost the throne of Delhi for good. Akbar was 
				not even an adult when the life of Humayun was suddenly cut 
				short on the stairs of his own library. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is more, the mighty 
				and competent Hindu general Himu, the Commander-in-Chief of 
				Islam Shah, had conquered both Delhi and Agra and declared 
				himself Raj Chakravarty. It seemed that the days of the Great 
				Moghuls were numbered and they would be driven out from the 
				sub-continent for ever. But the brave and indomitable Akbar rose 
				to the occasion and faced the music with courage and conviction. 
				With the able guidance and help of Bairam Khan, Akbar created 
				history by defeating the invincible' army of Himu at the Second 
				Battle of Panipat on the 5th of November, 1556. This was indeed 
				a momentous occasion in the annals of history. It not only re- 
				established the Moghul dynasty on the Indian soil but also 
				ensured its continuation for many a year to come. As a result, 
				the Moghuls ruled over this sub-continent with glory and 
				greatness for three hundred years more. It was the greatest 
				achievement in Akbar's chequered life and undoubtedly one of the 
				greatest events in the Moghul history. It was to glorify and 
				immortalise the historic event and also to facilitate the 
				collection of revenue during harvest in a more systematic way 
				that Akbar the Great introduced Tarikh-e-Elahi form the 10th of 
				Rabiul Awal in 963 A.H. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It may be mentioned in 
				this connection that from the very beginning of his reign, Akbar 
				felt the need of introducing a uniform scientific, workable and 
				acceptable system of calculating days and months through a 
				reformed calendar. With this end in view, he commissioned Amir 
				Fathullah Shirazi, a distinguished scientist and the most famous 
				astronomer of the day, to make a recommendation for the reformed 
				calendar. Abul Fazal, the renowned scholar and a minister of 
				Akbar the Great, in his scholarly work Akbar Namah, gives 
				details of the events leading to the new era under the Royal 
				Forman of Akbar. Abul Fazal explains that the use of the Hijrah 
				(Hegira) Era was unfair to the peasantry, because 31 lunar years 
				were equal to 30 solar years and the revenue was collected on 
				the basis of lunar years whereas the harvest depended on the 
				solar ones. Abul Fazal was right because the lunar year consists 
				of 354 days and the solar years has 365 or 366 days. Thus there 
				is difference of II or 12 days between the lunar and the solar 
				years. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Forman (Royal 
				Proclamation) ran as follows: &quot;In this dominion adorning time 
				and auspicious epoch, when a Qarn (cycle) of the victorious 
				session on throne of sovereignty has elapsed, and good day of 
				fortune has begun to smile, a world- obeyed' Forman was issued 
				to the effect that the governors of the Imperial dominions, and 
				the other offices of state and finance, who in accordance with 
				their degrees and positions, are recipients of the royal 
				favours, should know as follows:</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">'Whereas the great 
				officers of the court have represented to us as follows:&quot; It is 
				not hidden from the Inspired Kind that the object of 
				establishing an era is that the seasons of affairs and events 
				may be known with ease, and no one has any occasion for 
				alteration. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Suppose, for example, 
				someone makes a contract, or takes a favour or a loan, and the 
				period of execution be 4 years, 4 months: unless the exact date 
				of the beginning be known, it will be difficult, or rather 
				impossible, to determine the date of completion. It is event too 
				that whenever an era has prevailed for a long time, the 
				establishment of a new one opens the gates of ease and 
				prosperity for all mankind. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The repeated 
				representation of this body of men, and regard for their 
				positions, prevailed and were accepted, and an order was issued 
				that the new year, which followed close on the year of 
				ascension, should be made the foundation of the Divine Era, and 
				that the gates of joy and comfort should be opened. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Also that in the 
				almanacs of India they (the almanac writers) should enter this 
				new era instead of their discordant eras..... and that they do 
				away with their various eras. And whereas in the almanacs 
				current in India the years were solar, and the months lunar, we 
				ordered that the months of the new era should be solar.' </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Abul Fazal eulogises the 
				Forman of 992 A.H. (1584 A.D.) in the following way: The pillar 
				of the founders of the Sacred Era was the learned of the age, 
				the Plato of cycles (Alwani) Amir Fathullah Shirazi whose title 
				was Azad-ud-Daula. It was he who in a happy hour laid the 
				foundation of this heavenward soaring edifice. Although the 
				foundation (i.e. the Forman) took place in 992 A.H. yet the 
				position of events dates from the beginning of the sacred 
				accession of Akbar. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He further adds: The 
				Forman ordered that the new year which followed close on the 
				year of accession should be made the foundation of the Divine 
				Era and accordingly the first of Muharram (the first month of 
				the Hegira calendar) of 963 A.H. being close to the historic 
				occasion was also made the starting point of the 
				Tarikh-e-Elahi.&quot; Since the month of Muharram coincided with the 
				Bengali month of Baishakh in 963 A.H., the month of Baishakh in 
				Bengal was made the first month of the Bengali Era instead of 
				the month of Chaitra which was the first month of the Shaka Era 
				being practised in the then Bengal. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The months of the new 
				Bengali Era (or Tarikh-e-Elahi) were initially known as 
				Karwadin, Ardi, 'Vihisu, Khordad, Teer, Amardad, Shahriar, Aban, 
				Azur, Dai, Baham and Iskander Miz. Nobody knows for sure how and 
				when we started naming the months as Baishakh, Jaishtha, etc. It 
				is presumed that these months, based on the names of the stars, 
				were derived from the Shakabda which was introduced in 78 A.D. 
				to commemorate the reign of the Shaka dynasty in this 
				subcontinent. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The star-based names of 
				the months were derived as follows: </font></p>
				<ol>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Baishakh from the 
					star known as Bishakha </font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jiashthya from 
					Jaishtha </font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ashara from Shar
					</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sraban from Srabani
					</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bhadra from 
					Bhadrapada </font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ashwin from Aswaini
					</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Kartik from Kartika
					</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Agrahayon from 
					Agraihon </font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Poush from Poushya
					</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Magh from Magha
					</font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Falgun from Falguni, 
					and </font></li>
					<li>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Chaitra from Chitra 
					stars. </font></li>
				</ol>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some claim inadvertently 
				that the Bangla calendar was introduced by Shashanka, king of 
				Bengal, to commemorate his conquest of Assam. But records 
				testify to the fact the Shashanka, son of Maha Sengupta, 
				conquered Benaras and moved towards Chilka lake and never 
				towards Assam. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The system of 
				celebrating Nababarsha or Pahela Baishakh (Ist of Baishak) was 
				also introduced by Akbar the Great. After introducing 
				Tarikh-e-Elahi, he abolished the hitherto practised Muslim 
				festivals and replaced them by 14 new festivals, one of which 
				was Nawroze or the celebration of the New Year's Day. It was the 
				celebration of Nawroze which enabled Prince Selim (later emperor 
				Jehangir) to meet and fall in love with Meherunnisa (known as 
				Nurjahan in history). It was again in one such Nawroze festival 
				that the Prince Khurram (known as the Emperor Shahjahan in 
				history) first came across Mumtaz Mahal, whom he immortalised 
				through the great &quot;poetry in marble&quot; known the world over as Taj 
				Mahal. Had there been no Nababarsha (or Nawroze) festival, there 
				perhaps would be no Nurjahan, and no Taj Mahal. </font></p>
