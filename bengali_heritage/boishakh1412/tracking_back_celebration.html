				<p align="justify">&nbsp;<font face="Verdana">THE first day of the 
				Bengali calender-year is celebrated as the New Year in 
				Bangladesh. As Enamul Huq has written: &quot;The first day of the 
				festivities performed to mark the commencement of the New Year 
				is actually a specific festival day.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				One such day is the Bengali New Year. Its main characteristic is 
				that it is not a festival of the Hindus or the Buddhists alone. 
				It is universal in nature. In fact, festivals not related to 
				faith but secular in character are rare in the world. Enamul Huq 
				visualizes this universality in the collected prayer for rain 
				when men and women long for the clouds during the hot Bengali 
				calender-year (corrsponding to Mid-April to Mid-May). He 
				writes-&quot;Praying to the clouds for water is another popular 
				ritual of he Bengali New Year.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				Another aspect needs special mention. The majority of the 
				Bangladesh population is Muslims. But their new year does not 
				commence from the Ashura and nor is it sorrowful. In this 
				respect, too, the celebration of the New Year in Bangladesh is 
				quite unique.<br>
				The history of the Bengali New Year is not very old.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				Most probably the celebration of the Bengali New Year is 
				connected with the Bengali year. In Bengal, Emperor Akbar 
				started the Bengali calender-year on 10 March, 1585, but it 
				became effective from 16 March, 1586 the day of his ascension to 
				the throne. The basis of the Bengali year is the Hejiri lunar 
				year (Muslim era counted from the year of Muhammad's (SM) going 
				to Medina in 622 AD and the Bengali solar year. The Bengali year 
				was accepted even at the grassroot level. A possible reason for 
				this may be that the basis of the Bengali year is agriculture 
				and the beginning of the Bengali year is a time of collection of 
				taxes from the farmers. For instance, the farmer does not plough 
				the field even if it rains in Chaitra (the last month of the 
				Bengali year and corresponding to mid-march to Mid-April. The 
				fields are generally ploughed in the month of Baisakh 
				(April-May) and the prayer for the rains is also because of 
				this.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				However, the common man still refers to the Bengali calender of 
				his day to day activiites and the city-dwellers to the Juliun 
				calender. In this context, Shamsuzzaman Khan hasrightly remarked 
				that Akbar had once started the pan-Indian Islamic year as well 
				as the Bengali year. &quot;The introduction of Bengali year had not 
				only survived but at one time had also given the unique power of 
				nationalistic feelings and pride to the separated and divided 
				mainly joint Bengali socity.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				The New Year begins in different seasons in different countries 
				of the world. The Bengali New Year is in summer. Summer is not a 
				pleasant time in Bangladesh. Festivals and merriments are not as 
				much possible in summer as during the beginning of winter or 
				spring.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				Many people believe that the Bengali New Year should have begun 
				in the month of Agrahayan (the eighth month of the Bengali year 
				and corresponds to Mid-November to Mid-December) even 
				considering from the point of agriculture as Agrahayan is, for 
				instance, the month of reaping. Yet New Year is celebrated in 
				Baisakh. Pallab Sengupta writes: &quot;The New Year is calculated 
				either from Hemanta or late autumn (between autumn and winter) 
				or spring, that is from the time when new crops, flowers and 
				fruits start growing. This, at least, was the custom initially. 
				Later, with the passage of time, it shifted to other seasons due 
				to practical necessities. The custom of beginning the year from 
				January 1 or Baisakh 1 is thus quite foolish.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				But that mystery has not been unravelled. As our country is 
				located in the Tropics the importance of summer in this region 
				is natural. Moreover, the drying up of the canals, rivers and 
				streams at that time and the acute crisis for water makes the 
				tremendous changes in season easily felt. And then comes the 
				Nor'westers like wild buffaloes throwing everything in complete 
				disorder. The rains start immediately lowering the temperature 
				and making the conditions favourable for ploughing.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				In any country the principal festival has been organised with 
				respect to the particular season which has gained importance 
				there. Moreover, the minor seasonal festivals are also regularly 
				held. Bengal has a unique position in this regard. It is clear 
				that its main seasonal festival was in summer. Just as elsewhere 
				in the world, the main seasonal festival have been considered as 
				the New Year festival, the main summer festival of our country 
				is likewise considered as the New Year festival. One feels that 
				the devastating form of nature and the consequent creativity of 
				nature and the consequent creativity of nature that one 
				witnesses in Bangladesh, must have made summer and the summer 
				festivals so important in our ancient culture. Otherwise the New 
				Year celebration and festival of Bangladesh would have been 
				greatly influenced by religion. Our country is largely inhabited 
				by the Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims and Christians but &quot;no 
				particular influence of these religions are observed in our New 
				Year celebrations and festival.&quot;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				During the last four hundred years, that is after the 
				introduction of the Bengali year by Akbar, many festivals 
				connected probably with agriculture and seasons have become 
				associated with it. And the first of Baisakh gradully changed in 
				this way to become the New Year. To the special features of the 
				Bengali New Year that Enamul Huq has mentioned, we can add here 
				that the Bengali New Year saw the addition of a new political 
				dimension from the 60's of the present century. No season in any 
				other country has such a political aspect.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				In Bangladesh many secondary matters are linked with the New 
				Year. Some of those have become obsolete while some still exist 
				in certain special regions only.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				However, the practice of opening fresh account-book is still in 
				practice specially among the business class, On the New Year's 
				day the businessmen complete the accounts of the past year. For 
				this purpose many use a special type of ledger book bound in 
				red-cloth called the Khero Khata. The customers are greeted with 
				sweets on that day. Moreover many middle-class people of Dhaka 
				buy sweets and have good food on the occasion of the New Year.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				The most important function of Baisakh and the first day of 
				Baisakh is the fair. The New Year fairs of our country are also 
				nothing but the changed forms of the oldest 'seasonal festivals' 
				and 'agricultural festivals' of Bangladesh. This is because 
				local agricultural products and handicrafts are sold in these 
				fairs even today. According to a survey, about two hundred fairs 
				are organised throughout Bangladesh on the first day and the 
				first week of Baisakh. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				It has already been mentioned before that in Bangladesh 
				celebration of the first day of Baisakh began as a part of the 
				cultural movement and it added a new dimension to the political 
				movements. During the regime of Ayub Khan in the late sixties, 
				when attack was made against Rabindra Sangeet (Tagore Song) and 
				the Bengali culture, the Chhayanat group organised a programme 
				of Rabindrasangeet on the first of Baisakh under the banyan tree 
				at Ramna to celebrate the New Year. It was a protest against 
				religious fundamentalism. This endeavour by Chhayanat gradually 
				became popular and in the perspective of the freedom movement 
				the Bengali New Year was celebrated in a grand way as a protest 
				against the ideology of the ruling class. After the independence 
				of Bangladesh, the Bengali New Year was declared as public 
				holiday. Thus with the celebration of the New Year at the 
				grass-root level was added the endeavour of the urban people.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				We may conclude that the only secular festival of Bangladesh, in 
				every sense of the term, is the Bengali New Year. Its speciality 
				lies in the fact that in spite of being the festival of a 
				country where the majority are Muslims, it is not melancholic. 
				Although the state has been successful in the other areas it has 
				failed to incorporate the religious factor in this case. 
				Moreover, the New Year still adds a new dimension to the 
				movements against tyranny. Considering all these aspects we can 
				refer to the Bengali New Year as a festival of the world which 
				has rare characteristic.</font><br>
