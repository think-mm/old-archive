<img align="right" alt="The Thinker" border="0" src="rodin.jpg" width="210" height="307">One of the
finest collections of <font face="Bank-Gothic-Medium" size="3">French sculptor </font>Auguste
Rodin's <font face="Bank-Gothic-Medium" size="3">(1840-1917) </font>notable work
- &quot;The Thinker&quot;&nbsp;<font face="Bank-Gothic-Medium" size="3"> has
been attracting the free-thinkers and philosophers of all ages because the
sculpture gorgeously exhibit the abstract idea of thought or (free)- thinking.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
</font>The sculpture was actually modeled by Rodin in 1880-1882 for The Gates of Hell, and
exhibited in its original size (H. 71.5 cm) in Copenhagen in 1888. It was
enlarged in 1902 and exhibited in this form at the Salon of 1904 where it
aroused strong reactions from the press. It was on this occasion that Gabriel
Mourey, editor of the magazine Les Arts de la vie, launched a subscription for a
bronze &quot;offered to the people of Paris&quot; to erase the affront caused by
the refusal of the statue of Balzac in 1898. The Thinker was the first work by
Rodin to be erected in a public place. It was inaugurated in front of the
Pantheon on 21 April 1906 during an intense political and social crises which
turned this sculpture into a socialist symbol. In 1922, using as a pretext that
the statue created an obstacle during ceremonies, it was transported, with its
pedestal, to the garden of the Hôtel Biron which had by then become the Rodin
Museum.

<p>Many people have mis-conception about real man behind Rodin's creation - &quot;TheThinker&quot;.&nbsp; Some people erroneously think it could be a famous
philosopher, perhaps Plato, or even Nietzsche's Superman; But Nietzsche was
unknown to the world when Rodin created <i>The Thinker</i>, and Plato wasn't
even close. Some in their wildest thought wish to conclude that it might be the young Brando
[~ American actor widely known for his film appearances, most notably as Stanley
Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire]&nbsp; in one of his heavy
sessions at the Actors Studio, all naked and angst ridden, doing a philosopher
manqué: &quot;I could have been a think -er.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, the historical fact of &quot;man behind the thinker&quot; revealed by Joseph
Phelan is, <i>The Thinker</i> was originally meant to be
Dante in front of the <i><a href="http://www.musee-rodin.fr/senf1-e.htm" target="gates">The
Gates of Hell</a></i>, pondering his great poem. Dante as a voluptuous naked
male may seem absurd to those who think of the images painted in his time and
after, but Dante's head does bear some resemblance to the profile of <i>The
Thinker</i>.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left"><br>
Why is <i>The Thinker</i> naked? Because, according to Phelan,&nbsp; Rodin
wanted a heroic figure <i>à la</i> Michelangelo to represent Thinking as well
as Poetry.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rodin himself wrote about the &quot;thinker&quot; story:<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><i>The Thinker</i> has a story. In the
  days long gone by I conceived the idea of the Gates of Hell. Before the door,
  seated on the rock, Dante thinking of the plan of the poem behind him... all
  the characters from the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. This project was not realized.
  Thin ascetic Dante in his straight robe separated from all the rest would have
  been without meaning. Guided by my first inspiration I conceived another
  thinker, a naked man, seated on a rock, his fist against his teeth, he dreams.
  The fertile thought slowly elaborates itself within his brain. He is no longer
  a dreamer, he is a creator.</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The work of Rodin echoes with the great aspirations of the
19th century, the century of Darwin, Marx and Wagner. But in his equation, <i>The
Thinker</i> = the Poet = the Creator, Rodin was way ahead of his time. The
greatest German Philosopher of the 20th century, Martin Heidegger, only began to
formulate this equation in the 1930's in such works as &quot;The Thinker as
Poet&quot;, &quot;What are Poets For?&quot; and &quot;...Man Dwells
Poetically&quot;. Nowadays the sculpture is quite adorable to all humanities departments, repeated
endlessly by numerous art-loving free-thinking people.
<p align="left">[ <b>About Rodin :</b> <i>Francois Auguste Rene Rodin&nbsp; grew up in Paris, France.
He wanted to be an artist, but he could never get accepted into the great art
school in Paris. He finally joined a monastery where his abbot recognized his
talents and encouraged him to become a sculptor. Riodin's innovative, sometimes
controversial works include&nbsp; the lifelike Bronze Age and the uncompleted
series Gates of Hell, comprising some of his best-known works in his age, such
as The Kiss and The Thinker. </i>Readers are requested to visit the following
