					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If Arierl Sharon had 
					not been in a deep coma, he would have jumped out of his bed 
					for joy. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Hamas victory 
					fulfils his most ardent hopes. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For a whole year 
					now, he did everything possible to undermine Mahmoud Abbas. 
					His logic was quite obvious: The Americans wanted him to 
					negotiate with Abbas. Such negotiations would inevitably 
					have lead to a situation that would have compelled him to 
					give up almost all of the West Bank. Sharon had no intention 
					of doing so. He wanted to annex about half of the territory. 
					So he had to get rid of Abbas and his moderate image. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the last 
					year, the situation of the Palestinians got worse from day 
					to day. The actions of the occupation made normal life and 
					commerce impossible. The West Bank settlements were 
					continuously enlarging. The Wall which cuts off about 10% of 
					the West Bank was nearing completion. No important prisoners 
					were released. The aim was to impress on the Palestinians 
					that Abbas is weak (&quot;a chicken without feathers&quot;, as Sharon 
					put it), that he cannot achieve anything, that offering 
					peace and observing a cease-fire leads nowhere. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The message to the 
					Palestinians was clear: &quot;Israel understands only the 
					language of force.&quot; </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now the Palestinians 
					have put in power a party that speaks this language. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>WHY DID Hamas 
					win? </b></font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Palestinian 
					elections, like German ones, consist of two parts. Half the 
					members of parliament are elected on straight party lists 
					(like in Israel), the other half are elected individually in 
					their districts. This gave Hamas a huge advantage. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the party lists 
					elections, Hamas won with only a slight majority. This would 
					suggest that as far as the general political line is 
					concerned, the majority is not far from Fatah - two states, 
					peace with Israel. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many of the votes 
					given to Hamas had nothing to do with peace, religion and 
					fundamentalism, but with protest. The Palestinian 
					administration, run almost exclusively by Fatah, is tainted 
					with corruption. The &quot;man in the street&quot; felt that the 
					people on top don't care about him. Fatah was also blamed 
					for the terrible situation created by the occupation. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Also, the glory of 
					the martyrs and the indomitable fight against the immensely 
					superior Israeli army added to the popularity of Hamas.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 
					personal-regional elections, the situation of Hamas was even 
					better. Hamas had more creditable candidates, untainted by 
					corruption. Its party machine was far superior, its members 
					far more disciplined. In every district, there were several 
					Fatah candidates competing with each other. After the death 
					of Yasser Arafat, there is no strong leader capable of 
					imposing unity. Marwan Barghouti, who could perhaps have 
					done the job, is held in an Israeli prison - another big 
					Israeli gift for Hamas. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">PEOPLE WHO believe 
					in conspiracy theories can assert that it is all part of a 
					devious Israeli plan. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some people even 
					believe that Hamas was an Israeli invention right from the 
					beginning. That is, of course, a wild exaggeration. But it 
					is indeed the case that in the years before the first 
					intifada, the Islamic organization was the only Palestinian 
					group that had practically a free run in the occupied 
					territories. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The logic went like 
					this: Our enemy is the PLO. The Islamists hate the secular 
					PLO and Yasser Arafat. So we can use them against the PLO.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Moreover, while all 
					political institutions were banned, and even Palestinians 
					who worked for peace were arrested for carrying out illegal 
					political activity, no one could control what was happening 
					in the mosques. &quot;As long as they are praying, they are not 
					shooting,&quot; was the innocent opinion in the Israeli military 
					government. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the first 
					intifada broke out at the end of 1987, this was proved 
					wrong. Hamas was formed, partly in order to compete with the 
					Islamic Jihad fighters. Within a short time, Hamas became 
					the core of the armed uprising. But for almost a year, the 
					Israeli Security Service did not act against them. Then 
					policy changed and Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader, 
					was arrested. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All this happened 
					more through stupidity than design. Now the Israeli 
					government is faced with a Hamas leadership that was 
					democratically elected by the people. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>WHAT NOW? Well, a 
					strong feeling of deja vu.</b> </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 70s and 80s, 
					the Israeli government declared that it would never ever 
					negotiate with the PLO. They are terrorists. They have a 
					charter that calls for the destruction of Israel. Arafat is 
					a monster, a second Hitler. So, never, never, never ---
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the end, after 
					much bloodshed, Israel and the PLO recognized each other and 
					the Oslo agreement was signed. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now we are hearing 
					the same tune again. Terrorists. Murderers. The Hamas 
					charter calls for the destruction of Israel. We shall never 
					never never negotiate with them. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All this is very 
					welcome to Sharon's Kadima party, which openly calls for the 
					unilateral annexation of territory (&quot;Fixing the borders of 
					Israel unilaterally&quot;). It will help the Likud and the Labor 
					party hawks whose mantra is &quot;We have no partner for peace&quot;, 
					meaning - to hell with peace. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Gradually, the tone 
					will change. Both sides, and the Americans, too, will climb 
					down from the tall tree. Hamas will state that it is ready 
					for negotiations and find some religious basis for this. The 
					Israeli government (probably headed by Ehud Olmert) will bow 
					to reality and American pressure. Europe will forget its 
					ridiculous slogans. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the end, 
					everybody will agree that a peace, in which Hamas is a 
					partner, is better than a peace with Fatah alone. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let's pray that not 
					too much blood is spilled before that point is reached.
