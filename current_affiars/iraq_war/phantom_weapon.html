	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The phone hasn't been working for 
	almost a week now. We just got the line back today. For the last six days, 
	I'd pick up the phone and hear... silence. Nothing. This vast nothingness 
	would be followed by a few futile 'hellos' and a forceful punching of some 
	random numbers with my index finger. It isn't always like this, of course. 
	On some days, you can pick up the telephone and hear a bunch of other people 
	screaming &quot;allooo? Allooo?&quot; E. once struck up a conversation with a complete 
	stranger over the phone because they were both waiting for a line. E. wanted 
	to call our uncle and the woman was trying to call her grandson. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The dial-tone came about an hour ago 
	(I've been checking since morning) and I'm taking advantage of it. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The electricity situation isn't very 
	much better. We're getting two hours of electricity (almost continuous) and 
	then eight hours of no electricity (continuous). We still can't get the 
	generators going for very long because of the fuel shortage. Kerosene is 
	really becoming a problem now. I guess we weren't taking it very seriously 
	at first because, it really is probably the first time Iraq has seen a 
	kerosene shortage and it is still difficult to believe. They say in 1991 
	when there was a gasoline shortage which lasted for the duration of the war 
	and some time after, kerosene was always plentiful. This isn't the situation 
	now. We're buying it for obscene prices and it's really only useful for the 
	lamps and the heaters. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It feels like just about everyone 
	who can is going to leave the country before the elections. They say the 
	borders between Syria and Jordan might be closed a week before elections so 
	people are rushing to get packed and get out. Many families are simply 
	waiting for their school-age children to finish mid-year finals or college 
	exams so they can leave. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This was an interesting piece of 
	news a couple of days ago: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The United States has ended its 
	physical search for weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq, which was 
	cited by the first administration of President George W Bush as the main 
	reason for invading the country, the White House has said. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why does this not surprise me? Does 
	it surprise anyone? I always had the feeling that the only people who 
	actually believed this war was about weapons of mass destruction were either 
	paranoid Americans or deluded expatriate Iraqis- or a combination of both. I 
	wonder now, after hundreds and hundreds of Americans actually died on Iraqi 
	soil and over a hundred-thousand Iraqis are dead, how Americans view the 
	current situation. I have another question- the article mentions a &quot;Duelfer 
	Report&quot; stating the weapons never existed and all the intelligence was 
	wrong. This report was supposedly published in October 2004. The question is 
	this: was this report made public before the elections? Did Americans 
	actually vote for Bush with this knowledge? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Over here, it's not really &quot;news&quot; in 
	the sense that it's not new. We've been expecting a statement like this for 
	the last two years. While we were aware the whole WMD farce was just a badly 
	produced black comedy, it's still upsetting to hear Bush's declaration that 
	he was wrong. It's upsetting because it just confirms the worst: right-wing 
	Americans don't care about justifying this war. They don't care about right 
	or wrong or innocents dead and more to die. They were somewhat ahead of the 
	game. When they saw their idiotic president wasn't going to find weapons 
	anywhere in Iraq, they decided it would be about mass graves. It wasn't long 
	before the very people who came to 'liberate' a sovereign country soon began 
	burying more Iraqis in mass graves. The smart weapons began to stupidly kill 
	'possibly innocent' civilians (they are only 'definitely innocent' if they 
	are working with the current Iraqi security forces or American troops). It 
	went once more from protecting poor Iraqis from themselves to protecting 
	Americans from 'terrorists'. Zarqawi very conveniently entered the picture.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Zarqawi is so much better than WMD. 
	He's small, compact and mobile. He can travel from Falloojeh to Baghdad to 
	Najaf to Mosul whichever province or city really needs to be oppressed. 
	Also, conveniently, he looks like the typical Iraqi male- dark hair, dark 
	eyes, olive skin, medium build. I wonder how long it will take the average 
	American to figure out that he's about as substantial as our previously 
	alleged WMD. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now we're being 'officially' told 
	that the weapons never existed. After Iraq has been devastated, we're told 
	it's a mistake. You look around Baghdad and it is heart-breaking. The 
	streets are ravaged, the sky is a bizarre grayish-bluish color- a 
	combination of smoke from fires and weapons and smog from cars and 
	generators. There is an endless wall that seems to suddenly emerge in 
	certain areas to protect the Green Zoners... There is common look to the 
	people on the streets- under the masks of fear, anger and suspicion, there's 
	also a haunting look of uncertainty and indecision. Where is the country 
	going? How long will it take for things to even have some vague semblance of 
	normality? When will we ever feel safe? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A question poses it self at this 
	point- why don't they let the scientists go if the weapons don't exist? Why 
	do they have Iraqi scientists like Huda Ammash, Rihab Taha and Amir Al Saadi 
	still in prison? Perhaps they are waiting for those scientists to 
	conveniently die in prison? That way- they won't be able to talk about the 
	various torture techniques and interrogation tactics... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I hope Americans feel good about 
	taking their war on terror to foreign soil. For bringing the terrorists to 
	Iraq- Chalabi, Allawi, Zarqawi, the Hakeems How is our current situation 
	going to secure America? How is a complete generation that is growing up in 
	fear and chaos going to view Americans ten years from now? Does anyone ask 
	that? After September 11, because of what a few fanatics did, Americans 
	decided to become infected with a collective case of xenophobia Yet after 
	all Iraqis have been through under the occupation, we're expected to be 
	tolerant and grateful. Why? Because we get more wheat in our diets? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Terror isn't just worrying about a 
	plane hitting a skyscraperterrorism is being caught in traffic and hearing 
	the crack of an AK-47 a few meters away because the National Guard want to 
	let an American humvee or Iraqi official through. Terror is watching your 
	house being raided and knowing that the silliest thing might get you dragged 
	away to Abu Ghraib where soldiers can torture, beat and kill. Terror is that 
	first moment after a series of machine-gun shots, when you lift your head 
	frantically to make sure your loved ones are still in one piece. Terror is 
	trying to pick the shards of glass resulting from a nearby explosion out of 
	the living-room couch and trying not to imagine what would have happened if 
	a person had been sitting there. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The weapons never existed. It's like 
	having a loved one sentenced to death for a crime they didn't commit- having 
	your country burned and bombed beyond recognition, almost. Then, after two 
	years of grieving for the lost people, and mourning the lost sovereignty, 
	we're told we were innocent of harboring those weapons. We were never a 
	threat to America... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Congratulations Bush- we are a 
	threat now. </font></p>
