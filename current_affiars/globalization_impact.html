  <p>Globalization is, no doubt, the buzzword of the present time. The term is 
  used to signify that something profound is happening, that is, the world is 
  changing-new world economic, political and cultural order is emerging. The 
  term is used in so many different contexts, by so many different people, for 
  so many different purposes, that it is difficult to ascertain what is at stake 
  in the globalization problematic, what function the term serves, and what 
  effects it has for contemporary theory and politics. </p>
  <p>The multiplicity of senses includes concepts like the global 
  interdependence of nations, the growth of a world system, accumulation on a 
  world-scale, the global village and many other rooted in the more general 
  notion that the accumulation of capital, trade and investment is no longer 
  confined to the nation-state. In its most general sense &quot;globalization&quot; refers 
  to the cross-national flows of goods, investments, production and technology. 
  For many of the advocates of the globalization thesis these flows, both their 
  scope and depth, have created a new world order, with its own institutions and 
  configurations of power that have replaced the previous structures associated 
  with the nation-state. </p>
  <p>Origin of the concept, proponents and opponents </p>
  <p>The word 'global' is too old, almost over 400 hundred years. But the common 
  usage of the word 'globalization' did not begin until 1960. In general 
  dictionaries it came out with the meanings as spherical, universal, worldwide 
  etc. The concept staggered into academic circles but did not became 
  significant until early or possibly mid 1980s. And after that it's use became 
  widespread. Ronald Robertson was the first to use the word in the title of his 
  article published in 1985. He is also the key figure in formalization and 
  specification of the concept of globalization. Roberson's definition of 
  globalization runs as follows: </p>
  <p>&quot;Globalization as a concept refers both to the compression of the world and 
  the intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole. both concrete 
  global interdependence and consciousness of the global whole.&quot; </p>
  <p>Of all classical theorists, the one most explicitly committed to a 
  globalizing theory of modernization is Marx. Globalization caused an enormous 
  increase in the power of the capitalist class because it opened up new markets 
  for it. Indeed, the discovery of America and the navigation routes to Asia 
  established a 'world-market' for modern industry. The bourgeoisie rushed into 
  this opportunity with alacrity. This development is economic as well as 
  cultural because it gives a cosmopolitan character not only to production but 
  to consumption. Nor is this process restricted to Western Europe. The 
  bourgeoisie draws even 'barbarian' nations into its 'civilization' using the 
  'heavy artillery' of cheap commodities to batter down 'all Chinese walls'. The 
  bourgeoisie is, for Marx, recreating the world in its own image. It is 
  important to notice that in Marx's formulation the territorial boundary 
  remains. He recognizes the continuing existence of nation-state. There is, 
  however,! a seed of destruction for this. In establishing itself as a world 
  capitalist class the bourgeoisie also causes the world proletariat to coalesce 
  in opposition. The rise of power of the proletariat will, he argues, destroy 
  all bourgeois institutions including the nation-state. </p>
  <p>For his early theory of capitalist internationalization (focusing the 
  transfer of capital, goods and technology over great distances of the globe) 
  at about his time many theorists of globalization take their lead from Marx. 
  For these authors, as capitalism expands across the globe it internationalizes 
  the associated pattern of social relations known as class. Marx, of course, 
  never raised the question whether a &quot;globalized capitalism&quot; i.e. with no more 
  non-capitalism space to move into, would be viable. The reason was, he 
  expected capitalism to be overthrown and replaced by another system long 
  before its spatial limits had been reached. He did not asked the question, 
  hence did not try to answer. It was left for his followers to wrestle with the 
  later development. </p>
  <p>By contrast, the recent neoliberal proponents who popularized 
  globalization-like William Grieder, David Korten, Thomas Friedman- directly 
  assigned technology as the determining or autonomous factor in bringing about 
  a radical shift in the structure of capitalism and revolutionizing the world 
  order. In his One World, Ready or Not, William Grieder brings the message to 
  us that &quot;one world&quot; is inevitable and it is upon us-whether we like it or not. 
  It is the omni powerful technology that has characterized the global capital 
  and a single world. His notion of global capitalism runs like this: Technology 
  revolutionized the world order. It is a economic revolution. Every &quot;economic 
  revolution&quot; always originate with the invention of a new power source-a 
  machine that can do the work previously done by human toil but cheaper, faster 
  and more effective. And in this respect, it is similar with the revolutions of 
  the past--English industrial revolution in late seventies century a! nd the 
  great wave of industrial revolution in nineteen centuries. But those involved 
  only minor percentage of world population. The current revolutions is 
  distinctive in size and scope. The microchips brought revolution in the 
  information technology amplifying human intellect which has a unparallel 
  consequences in the economy- and in all spheres of modern life.(Greider 1997 : 
  11-26) </p>
  <p>Greider's account appears to be more narrative than analytical: In the 
  field of economy new technology speeds up migration of capital, encourages 
  production to move to new locations that is easier (and cheaper) for 
  enterprises. It makes labor more individualistic, sophisticated and flexible, 
  decentralizes the decision-making ( management) and scatter the jobs in many 
  distant places. Reliable computerized data has made the financial market more 
  powerful by maximizing and monitoring the return on capital without regard to 
  national identity and by discipline government or even entire regions of the 
  globe, in its own way, if impediments is created to profitable enterprises.
  </p>
  <p>Thus, global capitalism pulled together numerous competing centers-New 
  York, Tokyo, Frankfurt, London, Hong Kong-converging with each other and 
  contesting for dominance. More importantly, millions of peasants finds scope 
  to escape from poverty. Because shift of productive wealth reflected in the 
  extraordinary growth rates of some developing countries. And culturally, 
  unique converging traits are being discovered in the cultures of Confucianism, 
  Buddhism and Islam. Truly profound consequence is ideological. Marxism is 
  almost vanquished as an alternative system. Capitalism is triumphant. The 
  ideological conflict that has preoccupied political imagination for 150 years 
  , is ended. This is how, in Greider's view, the world has converged and become 
  &quot;one world&quot; : </p>
  <p>To make a well-organized effort to the different positions/debates on 
  globalization present some difficulties since there are no definitive or fixed 
  line of contestations. Multiple conversations coexists with few real 
  dialogues. Dominant ideological traditions--conservatism, liberalism or 
  socialism--has not yet offered a comprehensive readings of or responses to the 
  globalization. Just as some conservatives and socialists find common grounds 
  in dismissing the significance of globalization. Accepting this, it is 
  feasible to identify arguments , in broad stroke, between those who consider 
  that contemporary globalization is a real and significant historical 
  development-the globalists-and those who conceive it as a primarily 
  ideological or mythical construction which has marginal explanatory value-the 
  opponents or critics. However, we will certainly show the differences and 
  diversities of views within each camp. </p>
  <p>The fundamental question, posed by the critics of globalization, is: what 
  is the 'global' in the in globalization? Since, there is no clear geographical 
  referents, how it is possible to distinguish the international or the 
  transnational from the global , or, for that matter, processes of 
  regionalization from processes of globalization? It is precisely because much 
  of the literature on globalization fails to specify the spatial referents for 
  the global that, so the opponents argue, the concept becomes meaningless as 
  vehicle for understanding the contemporary world. The opponents contend that a 
  more valid conceptualization of current trends is captured by the terms 
  'internationalization' -this is, growing links between essentially discrete 
  national economies or societies-and 'regionalization' or 'triadization'-the 
  geographical clustering of cross-border economic and social changes. This is 
  an argument for the continuing primacy of territory, boarders, place! and 
  national governments to the distribution and location of power, production and 
  wealth in the contemporary world order. Yet a puzzle arises: namely, how to 
  explain the disjuncture between the widespread discourse of globalization and 
  the realities of a world in which, for the part , the routines of everyday 
  lives are dominated by national and local circumstances? However, the solution 
  to this methodological problem, for most of the analysts (critics) involves 
  construction of an abstract or ideal-typical model of globalization and asses 
  how far contemporary trends match up to it. Other critics seek to asses how 
  far contemporary trends compare with what many economic historian have argued 
  was the belle époque of globalization, namely the period from 1890 to 1914.
  </p>
  <p>Instead of providing an insight into the forces shaping the contemporary 
  world order, the concept of globalization, argue many opponents, performs a 
  rather different function. In essence, the discourse of globalization is 
  understood as a primarily ideological construction; a convenient myth which, 
  in part , help justify and legitimize the neoliberal global project, that is, 
  the creation of global free-market and consolidation of Anglo-American 
  capitalism within the world's major economic regions. In this respect, the 
  concept of globalization operates as a 'necessary myth', through which 
  politicians and governments set discipline their citizens to meet the 
  requirements of the global marketplace. It is thus, unsurprising that 
  discussion of globalization became so widespread just at that juncture when 
  the neoliberal project- the Washington consensus of deregulation, 
  privatization, structural adjustment programs (SAPs) and limited 
  government-consolidated its hold within key W! estern capitals and global 
  institutions such as IMF. </p>
  <p>Frequently associated with this position is the Marxist perspective on 
  globalization. In Marxist analysis, capitalism , as a social order, has a 
  pathological expansionist logic, since to maintain profits capital constantly 
  has to exploit new markets. To survive, national capitalism must continuously 
  expand the geographical reach of capitalist social relations. The history of 
  the modern world order is the history of Western capitalist powers dividing 
  and redividing the world up into exclusive economic zones. Today, it is 
  argued, imperialism has acquired a new form as formal empires have been 
  replaced by new mechanism of multilateral control and surveillance, such as 
  the G7 and World Bank. As such, the present epoch is described by many 
  Marxists not in terms of globalization, but instead as a new mode of Western 
  imperialism dominated by the needs and requirements of finance capital within 
  the world's major capitalist sates. </p>
  <p>The globalist account rejects the assertion that the concept of 
  globalization can be simply dismissed either as a purely ideological 
  construction or a as a synonym for Western imperialism. While not denying that 
  the discourse of globalization may well serve the interest of powerful social 
  forces in the West , the globalist account also emphasizes that it reflects 
  real structural changes in the scale of modern social organization. </p>
  <p>Although, globalists give differential emphasis to the material and 
  cognitive/subjective aspects of globalization and consider economic 
  globalization as one of the aspects of globalization. We will, however, 
  consider economic globalization as fundamental since validity of globalization 
  in economic arena will determine the status of other parts of the globalist 
  thesis (cultural etc.) Therefore, we will give more emphasis on the debate 
  that centers around the fundamental question : whether the present stage of 
  capitalism represents a new epoch or is basically the continuation of the past 
  or an amalgam of new developments </p>
  <p>Is Globalization a New Stage in the Contemporary World Capitalism? </p>
  <p>From the globalist point of view, Barbuck and Robonson systematically 
  addressed the issue that capitalism, today, has entered into a new epoch. This 
  epochal shift is the fourth one in the world history of capitalism. First came 
  the age of discovery and conquest. Capitalism, emerging from its feudal cocoon 
  in Europe, began its outward expansion, symbolized by Columbus's arrival in 
  the America. This was the epoch of mercantilism and primitive accumulation, 
  what Marx referred to as the &quot;rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production.&quot; 
  The second shift is the birth of industrial capitalism, the rise of the 
  bourgeoisie, and forging of the nation state. This epoch spanned what Eric 
  Hobsbawm in his seminal historical works calls the ages of revolution, 
  capital, and empire. It is keynoted by the French revolution and the 
  18th-century manufacturing revolution in England. The third epoch starts 
  around the turn of the 20th century with the rise of corporate (&quot;monopoly&quot;) 
  capitalism an! d financial industrial corporation, intensified wars among the 
  imperial powers, and the emergence of a socialist alternative. This epochal 
  change is exemplified by World War I and Bolshevik revolution, the &quot;Age of 
  Extremes,&quot; as Hobsbawm titles his history of the 20th century. </p>
  <p>Today we are in the early phases of the fourth epoch of capitalism. 
  Referred to as globalization, it is highlighted technologically by the 
  microchip and the computer-the &quot;information age&quot;-and politically by the 
  collapse of 20th century attempts at socialism. The latter was most 
  graphically signaled by the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of 
  the Soviet Union shortly thereafter, and also by a lesser discussed event, the 
  defeat of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1990 elections, which symbolized 
  the failure of whole generation of Third World national liberation movements 
  to offer an alternative to world capitalism. </p>
  <p>However, to demonstrate the epochal shift in the current structure of 
  capitalism the arguments mainly presented include the issues-- world trade, 
  flow of capital, global ( transnational) formation of social classes and 
  global division of labor etc. The proponents emphasizing on different points 
  vary, as we have mentioned before that they range from neoliberal/globalist to 
  postmodern left. </p>
  <p>There is a major current of dissenting voices on the left staking out the 
  position that globalization is not a new epoch. These include some Marxists 
  who insist that globalization is an illusion fostered by the ideologues and 
  pundits of the established order . The basic dynamics of capitalism have not 
  changed in any way--capitalism is still capitalism. The notion of epochal 
  shift or fundamental change in the structure of capitalism has been denied as 
  an exaggeration. In the contemporary issues of Monthly Review, Paul Sweezy and 
  some other analysts took the position that nothing happened to characterize 
  capitalism as globalization or something new. Putting capitalism in historical 
  context, Sweezy observes that globalization is not a condition or a 
  phenomenon. It is a process that has been going on for long time, in fact ever 
  since capitalism came into the world as a viable form of society four or five 
  centuries ago. </p>
  <p>Most of the critics, however, do not deny that there is some substance to 
  the globalist thesis in the sense that there is clearly some changes occurred 
  in the contemporary world capitalism. The sheer volume of cross-border flows, 
  of products, people, capital and above all of money is impossible to dispute. 
  The important issue, however, turns on the meaning of these flows. In order to 
  make a point in support of globalization thesis, as Linda Weiss most 
  convincingly posed the questions, one would expect to find evidence indicating 
  that the changes in question conformed to at least three criteria: (1) 
  novelty-is it unusual or without parallel, thus suggesting secular growth 
  rather than oscillation? ( 2) magnitude-how substantial is it in size? and (3) 
  distribution-to what extent is it world-wide in scope? The pattern of world 
  economy is at best international-although some analysts consider the trend as 
  intra-regional. They argue that intra-European trade now accounts for som! e 
  62 per cent of its total export trade. Intra-regional trade within the 
  American region-the US , Canada and Mexico-increased between 1980 and 1992 
  from 68 per cent to 79 per cent of total US-Japan and US-EU trade. 
  Intra-regional trade has also become the dominant trend in Asia-China, ASEAN, 
  Japan and the NICS-as the region has enhanced its importance as export market 
  and production site for Japan and the NICs. Intra-Asian trade in the period 
  1986-92 rose from 32.4 to 47.7 per cent of total exports, thus reversing the 
  traditional dominance of trade with the US. A similar story can be told for 
  investment. </p>
  <p>Globalsits, however, do not see that the trend of regionalism in world 
  economy contradict the process of globalization since the contemporary growth 
  of regionalism has not produced any sharp division of the world into competing 
  blocs . On the contrary, it has largely facilitated and encouraged economic 
  globalization since it offers a mechanism national economies can engage more 
  strategically with the global markets. Now, whether a certain process is 
  global or regional or international is a problematic both methodological and 
  ideological as we mentioned earlier. </p>
  <p>However, the common tenets of the globalists is that the technology is the 
  determining factor in the globalized capitalism and its inevitability. As 
  Friedman informs us that the defining economist of the cold war period were 
  Karl Marx and John Keynes, who each in his own way wanted to tame capitalism, 
  the defining economist of the globalization is Intel chairman Andy Grove who 
  wanted to unleash capitalism. And the unleashing is certainly done by the 
  forces of technologies: computerization, miniaturization, digitalization, 
  satellite communication, fiber optics and the Internet. Today's globalization 
  system is symbolized by World Wide Web. To affirm the inevitability of 
  technology-driven globalization, he with a tone of irony, comments: &quot; I think 
  it's a good thing that the sun comes up every morning. It does more good than 
  harm. But even if I didn't much care about dawn there isn't much I could do 
  about it. I didn't start globalization, I can't stop it.&quot; Similar is the vie! 
  w, we mentioned earlier, expressed by Grieder that machine is the subject that 
  brought global capitalism and imposed &quot;one world&quot; before us. Interestingly, 
  there are those on the left who have the similar views of placing technology 
  over the forces of social classes in the dynamics of contemporary capitalism.
  </p>
  <p>Critics from socialist perspective , without denying the contemporary 
  change, explain current capitalist development in terms of what is pin pointed 
  by Ellen Meiksins Wood &quot; the constant technological changes driven by the 
  pressures of competition and profit-maximization, the constant recomposition 
  of capital and labor and the class relation between them.&quot; </p>
  <p>We have seen that Marxists emphasize that capitalism has always been a 
  global system, even if the particular ways the world economy affects workers 
  in particular places changes over time. They argue, if we see the present in 
  long perspective of economic history the world's political economy is not more 
  globalized than it was a hundred or a hundred and fifty years ago. The 
  dynamics of capitalism has not changed. </p>
  <p>This view has been criticized by the leftists with globalist view in that 
  if we break capitalism down into its most fundamental characteristics-the 
  exploitation of labor by capital, commodity production, and the continued 
  expansion of capitalism-then, yes, nothing has changed. However, to take this 
  view one could argue that nothing has changed since Columbus, or perhaps since 
  the industrial revolution, if one defines the earlier period as mercantile 
  capitalism. There is no doubt that &quot; capitalism is capitalism is capitalism, 
  but the failure to distinguish between its different avatars freezes us in 
  modes and forms of struggle which effete and ineffectual and blinds us to the 
  revolutionary possibilities opened up by information technology&quot; </p>
  <p>The evidence presented in favor of the above argument form the left with 
  globalsit views overlap with those of the global neoliberalists as we have 
  already mentioned. The position of &quot;global left&quot; as summarized by Sivanandan 
  makes the point clear: The new technologies have inevitably given rise to a 
  new kind of capitalist system, with fragmented workers stretched across world 
  in &quot;global assembly lines&quot; ; created &quot;international bourgeoisie &quot; and freely 
  mobile capital that can &quot;walk any part of the world where labor is cheap&quot; 
  bypassing the nation-state and leaving in its wake an essentially powerless 
  working class. </p>
  <p>Wood seriously opposes the view that sum up these changes of current 
  capitalism under the rubric of globalization. To her, the term globalization 
  is misleading, it does not represent the reality of the historical moment. It 
  brings heaviest ideological burden to the neck of the left today. In the 
  current concept of globalization left joints with right-in an unprecedented 
  historical alliance-and accept that &quot;There Is No Alternative&quot; to capitalism. 
  It serves as the excuse of complete defeatism, and abandonment any kind of 
  anticapitalist project. </p>
  <p>It is true, a section of left, or former revolutionary left who feel 
  overwhelmed by the seeming power of global capital has surrendered the 
  possibility of radical alternative. They believe it is pragmatic for the left 
  to accept &quot; the logic of the market&quot; and find space in global neoliberalism, 
  or market socialism etc. Some on the left believe that to accept the changes 
  and the effect of globalization is not necessarily defeatist. To accept 
  broader transnational perspective of new global economy and challenge the 
  capital from such a broader platform is more pragmatic. Ignoring this reality 
  is rather misguidance and failure. </p>
  <p>Socialists, we have seen, doesn't deny the significant changes in the 
  current world capitalism but they raise strong objection to consider that 
  change a 'qualitative leap' as contained in the concept of globalization. 
  However, now the question comes to the forefront-if globalization is the 
  inherent character of capital then, is contemporary globalism different from 
  the past? James Petras holds: the answer is yes in quantitative terms, no in 
  terms of the structures and units of analysis that define the process.&quot; </p>
  <p>Crisis in and Resistance against Globalization </p>
  <p>Globalization, especially when regarded as the key concept for 
  understanding contemporary trends, is often seen as a reality that displaced 
  nation-state , imperialism and class struggle. In this sense, it has became an 
  all-encompassing social force. For establishment pundits like Thomas Friedman, 
  globalization is new technological-economic system based in the microchip and 
  rules by an &quot;electronic&quot; herd of financial investors and multinational 
  corporations, sweeping everything that came before it. In this view, 
  globalization is the end of history in which all countries and economies are 
  linked together through the capitalist market. And not only is the 
  nation-state thought to have been displaced economically, but national 
  struggle is considered largely ineffective. This is because market, democracy 
  and prosperity will work together to pun an end to conflicts. </p>
  <p>Critics consider it as the tunnel vision of history in which all events 
  destined to a particular contemporary outcome. The globalization process is a 
  highly contradictory phenomenon. As multinational corporations grow overseas, 
  they absorb a growing proportions of local resources while the fiscal bases to 
  sustain the state that supports the multinationals decline. The result is an 
  increase in taxes on wage/salaried workers relative to multinational 
  corporations and deeper social cuts to finance the export economy. Hence, 
  globalization is accompanied by domestic decay. The global reality today is 
  very distant from the claims of the globalists. Inequality and polarization is 
  the ascending trend. The social conditions on the eve of 20th century are, 
  reversing to the 19th century. The income gap between the fifth of the world's 
  people living in the richest courtiers and the fifth in the poorest was 74 to 
  1 in 1997, up from 60 to 1 in 1990 and 30 to 1 in 1960. In the nineteent! h 
  century, too, inequality grew rapidly in the last three decades, the era of 
  rapid global integration: the income gap between the top and bottom countries 
  increased from 3 to 1 in 1820 to 7 to 1 in 1870 and 11 to 1 in 1913. </p>
  <p>In the US over 60 million have no or inadequate health care and over ten 
  million children are not covered. Job insecurity increases as managers assume 
  absolute power to hire, fire and subcontract part-time and temporary work . 
  Impoverished families fare forced to work at below subsistence minimum wage 
  jobs or go hungry. More workers work longer hours today than they did 30 years 
  ago. Retirement age is reaching nearly 70 years old. Pension plans are no 
  longer provided by employers. Prison-labor is employed by private employers 
  for private gain. The number of children in orphanage is growing, as is the 
  number of children living in poverty. The future for most of the young 
  generation looks insecure and fearful both in Europe and North America. To 
  deny this reality and project a rosy future is the essence of 'globalony'. </p>
  <p>On the other hand, the rosy future of globalization is for a specific group 
  of capitalist operating at the center of globalism-the investment bankers and 
  brokers. They move to the forefront of the US's richest companies. Goldman 
  Sachs group, Wall Street's biggest private partnership, will probably earn 
  close to three billion in 1997. In 1975 brokerage and investment banking firms 
  earned $4.8 billion; by 1994 annual profits had grown to $ 69.5 billion. In 
  comparison, the biggest and most successful high-tech firm, Microsoft, after 
  tax profits were $2.2 billion. Clearly globalism is the wave of the future for 
  speculators and financiers, but it would be the height of impertinence to 
  confuse with the rest of the humanity. A similar process is occurring in the 
  Third World countries. Penetration of capital is accompanied by unemployment, 
  poverty and crime. By the early 1990s, 15 out of the so-called developing 
  countries had steadily declined in income growth, with so! me the 'economic 
  miracle' cases-Nigeria, Argentina and Venezuela - having their gross domestic 
  product drop by double digits. As opposed to egalitarian world, world 
  inequality rather reached to a new dimension. As David Korten, former 
  proponent now turned critic of global capitalist development, has 
  observed-&quot;.the great majority of the benefits of global economic growth gone 
  not to the poor but to those who already have more than they need often far 
  more. Accordingly to the 1997 UNDP Human Development Report, in 1960 the share 
  of global income enjoyed by the wealthiest 20 percent of the world's people 
  was thirty times the amount shared by the poorest 20 percent. The ratio more 
  than doubled during the thirty years of official development efforts. It 
  reached sixty to one in 1991 and rose to seventy-eight to one in 1994. The 
  more successful capitalism becomes in the consolidation of its triumph the 
  faster the gap grows.&quot; </p>
  <p>Global integration goes hand in hand with environmental degradation and 
  endangering human life. The process of deforestation is in order in many of 
  the Third World courtiers leading to the increasing soil erosion, soil 
  depletion, falling water tables, and more frequent flood and draught. In most 
  South Asian countries, for example, the remaining forest are being logged 
  rapidly by transnational corporations. One observer portrays: &quot;As country 
  after country is logged out, the loggers simply move elsewhere. In Southeast 
  Asia loggers move to New Guinea, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia, the last 
  countries that are still forested-and, significantly, those that have remained 
  outside the orbit of the world trading system. At the current rate of forest 
  destruction, these countries will be deforested within next decade. Already, 
  Mitsubishi and Weyerhaeuser are moving to Siberia-the last major unlogged 
  forest area on the planet.&quot; </p>
  <p>Therefore, the growing contradiction between globalization and decay of the 
  domestic economy and society in the north and the contradiction between 
  growing elite integration and the pillage of domestic resources and labor in 
  the south is creating a new base for resistance-some with common opposition 
  against capitalist state and globalization. Thus, historically, conflict is 
  the nature of the capitalist accumulation. Increased transnational economic 
  activity does not mean that the laws of the motion of the system have been 
  dispensed with and capitalism has transcended its contradictions. Rather, it 
  reveals that the more globalized the system, the greater the danger of global 
  waves of crises. </p>
  <p>This was illustrated by the incidence of November 1999, when massive 
  protests involving seven hundred organization and upwards of forty thousand 
  people-workers, environmentalists, students, religious groups, etc-suddenly 
  brought the World Trade Organization (WTO) meetings in Seattle to a halt, 
  grabbing not only the US's but world's spotlight. There had been large 
  militant protests against globalization before-against IMF and World Bank. 
  What was startling this time was that such massive, militant protest took 
  place in the United States, the strong foothold of global capitalism. The 
  protest exposed a lie carefully cultivated widely projected image of the US as 
  a hegemonic power lacking internal social contradictions. </p>
  <p>Today, challenges against globalization trend is posed from different part 
  of the world in different forms. For example East Asia . Once establishment 
  economists and globalists were singing praises of the &quot;Asian tigers&quot;. The 
  World Bank basked in the glow of its 1993 report, The Asian Miracle. 
  Throughout ruling circles, the &quot;Asian mode&quot; was touted as proof that open 
  markets and the free flow capital would be the salvation of humankind. Today, 
  more than a year into the region's devastating economic crises, the World Bank 
  is preparing a new report. Rethinking Asia's Miracle it is to be called. If 
  any region is a test case for establishment claims about globalization it is 
  East Asia and its newly industrializing countries-South Korea, Thailand , 
  Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan . And the claims for economic globalization 
  now seems laughable. East Asia's crisis now pose a serious threat to the 
  capitalist world economy as a whole, &quot;the biggest threat to global pros! 
  perity&quot; since the1970s as Business Week puts it (January 26, 1998). </p>
  <p>The working class and the poor throughout East Asia now find themselves in 
  a battle with international capital. In Korea, between the summer of 1987 and 
  late 1989 Korean workers launch over 7000 strikes ( close to 10 per day), a 
  record of a country of this population. Strikes by young women in garment 
  factories in Bogor and electronics plants in Kuala Lumpur, by aircraft workers 
  in Bandung against IMF-directed layoffs, mass demonstrations by tens and 
  thousands of workers in Surabaya, and weeks of strikes by workers at Kia in 
  South Korea are all sings of working-class resistance against privatization, 
  austerity and poverty. East Asia has become the focal-point of the 
  international class struggle. Out of these struggles a new &quot;Asian Model&quot; may 
  emerge-a model of working class resistance to the capitalist globalization.
  </p>
  <p>As oppose to the &quot;ineffective&quot; struggle one can find throughout the world 
  peasants movements in Mexico, guerilla movements in Peru, labor union in 
  France, students in Britain and the Seattle protest in the US and varieties of 
  other groups and international movements like environment women and gay have 
  resisted hegemony of globalization and creating counter tendencies at such 
  significant level that, at the 1996 annual Devos World Economic Forum's 
  founder and managing director published a warning entitles: &quot;Start Taking 
  Backlash Against Globalization Seriously&quot;. </p>
  <p>Analyzing various resistances to globalization, James Petras observes that 
  one must take into account the great variety of social forces have taken the 
  lead in different social-economic settings, with varying degrees of intensity 
  and with a broad gamut of strategies. Nevertheless, he pointed out the 
  worldwide resistances showing certain general characteristics containing both 
  weakness and strength of the movements against the forces of world capitalism. 
  First, beginning in the early 1970s and accelerating through the 1990s, the 
  capitalist class has taken an advantage of highly bureaucratized trade union 
  movement divorced from the rank an file and highly dependent on state favors 
  to roll back labor's bargaining power. While the current capitalists have 
  developed a coherent capitalist strategy that bars any concession on welfare 
  issues, labor bureaucrats have remained tied to earlier concept of social 
  contracts and the welfare state, unable and unwilling to develop an anti-! 
  capitalist strategy or consider a socialist alternative. Here, labors remains 
  as pressure groups linked to sectoral struggles and narrow wage issues. 
  Second, taking electoral vehicles as approach to blocking the application of 
  globalist polices. Since, most anti-globlist electoral opposition is confined 
  to the legislature, and a minority at that, the globalist polices continues to 
  be applied by executive decree and/or through globalist influence over the 
  legislature. Third, former revolutionary groupings in the seventies and 
  eighties , upon turning to electoral politics an entering political office 
  have almost always abandoned their opposition to globalization an accepted its 
  postulates. As a result, all the groups adversely affected by globalization 
  have turned towards extra-parliamentary activities and organizations: general 
  strikes in France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, South Korea etc. Land 
  occupations in Brazil, Paraguay, El Salvador, Mexico, Colombia Guatemala,! 
  etc. Urban revolts in Venezuela, Dominican Republic Argentina etc. Gu erilla 
  movements in Mexico, Peru, Zaire etc. An important weakness of these 
  resistances is that they all start as defensive movements of existing rights 
  and interests threatened by the globalist ruling class. These are to protest 
  the loss of employment, cuts in social security, living standards, pension 
  plans, privatization of public enterprises etc. But within the common defense 
  of past popular gains, some of the movements have taken the offensive and 
  sough to advance toward structural changes: the peasants movement of Chapare, 
  Mexico, the MST in Brazil, the FARC-peasant movements in Colombia, the coca 
  farmers in Chapare etc. An important positive aspect of the opposition to 
  globalism is the general tendency of all movements to form coalitions with or 
  incorporate environmental, gender , ethnic or racial groups and struggles. 
  This unity has increased the strength of challenge against globalist project 
  of exploitation and pollution and deepening inter-class and intra-class in! 
  equalities. But the process of opposition, he evaluates , is uneven between 
  countries and within countries. And within countries some sectors, regions, 
  classes, ethnic group demonstrate greater resistance than others. For example, 
  in Europe and Asia it has been the workers from the most advanced sectors ( 
  transport in France and metal workers in South Korea) who have spearheaded the 
  struggle. Public sectors workers have been more active than private sectors in 
  Chile, Argenina, Brzil and Mexico. In Brazil landless workers are more 
  combative than the trade unions etc. However, the spread of opposition and its 
  growing depth outside the electoral arenas has created firm base for a 
  systematic alternative. Now the basic question that hasn't been resolved: if 
  there is such general opposition, why hasn't globalism been replaced by 
  socialist forces? To Petras, &quot;The answer is tow fold: more groups have been 
  thrown back onto limited resources and as a result are largely engaged in def! 
  ensive struggles; secondly, while various alternatives are being elabo rated , 
  none have achieved general acceptance or they remain embedded in sectoral or 
  local settings.&quot; </p>
  <p>Globalization or Imperialism-- Where Are We? </p>
  <p>We have seen that one of the most declared tenets of globalization is that 
  there is no alternative to it. The dominant globalist view asserts that it has 
  made class struggle ineffective, imperialism irrelevant and socialism a 
  permanently defeated project. So humanity has no option other then 
  globalization. Global capitalism has brought revolution in the economy. 
  Technology brought tremendous opportunity for mankind producing and 
  distributing resources all over the world. Hence, it is pragmatic to take the 
  opportunity and go with the flow or , as Friedman puts it, be 'road-killed'. 
  The mantra constantly repeated in his work is that globalization is not a 
  choice. It's a reality. </p>
  <p>Globalization has also influenced the left intelligentsia. And there exist 
  confusion at different levels among some Marxists and postmodern Marxists 
  regarding the globalist thesis which, as Hirst and Thosmom put it, mesmerized 
  the analysts. James Petras shows that in several respect-measure of power, 
  specificity of agencies, understanding class interests and inequalities, flows 
  of income and investment-globalization shows weakness to imperialism in 
  analyzing the structure and functions of contemporary world capitalism. </p>
  <p>Firstly, the concept of globalization argues for the interdependence of 
  nations, shared nature of economies, the mutuality of interests, shared 
  benefits of the exchanges. Imperialism, on the contrary, emphasizes the 
  dominations and exploitation by imperial states (and certainly multinational 
  corporations and international financial institutions connected with them) of 
  less developed states and laboring classes. In contemporary world it is clear 
  that the imperial countries are hardly dependent on most of the Third World 
  countries they trade with, they have diverse suppliers. They wield 
  disproportionate or decisive influence in the international financial agencies 
  and other world bodies. On the other hand, dominated counties are low wage 
  area, interest and profit exporters, they are virtual captives of the 
  international financial institutions (IFIs) and highly dependent on limited 
  overseas market. Hence, imperialism fits the realties much better than the 
  notion of globaliza! tion. Secondly, with regard to the social agencies of 
  capitalist expansion, the concept of globalization heavily relies on the 
  diffusions of technology accompanied by the information flows and the abstract 
  notion of &quot;market forces&quot;. In contrast the concept of imperialism sees 
  multinational corporations, banks, the imperial states are the driving forces 
  of capitalist expansion- the flow of capital, goods and technology. Technology 
  have no &quot;logic&quot;, it is the head of the imperials states, multinational 
  corporations(MNCs), supported by the IFIs (whose personnel are appointed by 
  the imperials states in line with the interest of the MNCs) establish the 
  frame of global exchanges. Technology operate only within that parameter. 
  Thus, the concept of imperialism gives more precise idea of the social 
  agencies of worldwide capitalist movements than the notion of globalization. 
  Thirdly, globalists tell us that the contemporary capitalism brought 
  tremendous opportunity of resources for di! fferent nations and mass people of 
  the world. On the contrary, reality represents a robust relation between 
  worldwide capitalist expansion and the increasing inequalities in the world. 
  Data covering long and short-term large-scale flows of incomes both at world 
  level, national and class level shows the increasing inequalities. 
  Globalization does not focus on the different locus of exploitation and 
  accumulation of the giant firms. In contrast, the frameworks of imperialism 
  explains inequalities and exploitations worldwide. Fourthly, the structure of 
  the international flows income, investment, royalty payments does not 
  correspond to any notion of interdependent world as premised by globalist 
  theory. In contrast, the uni-directional flow toward the imperial based 
  corporations is ready understood within the conceptual framework of imperial 
  theory. A vivid example is the military policy and intelligence operations. 
  There is no mutual penetration of military commands, but the extension of 
  military missions from the imperial center to the dominated c! ountries. All 
  these empirical measures allow us to argue for the greater scientific utility 
  of the concept of imperialism over globalization. </p>
  <p>We have shown that recent proponents of globalization, from neoliberal 
  standpoint, are more straightforward in claiming that world has become &quot;one 
  world&quot; . They claim that modern computer technology caused radical shift in 
  the structure of capitalism hitherto unprecedented in history and has brought 
  tremendous opportunity for mankind. Hence, it has defeated socialism 
  permanently as a viable alternative. Globalist Friedman is more clear in 
  claiming homogeneity in economy and culture, free from contradictions. </p>
  <p>Globalists with post Marxian/postmodern left share with the basic 
  assumptions of globalization that capitalism has changed fundamentally and 
  that nation-state has become powerless or its power has reduced substantially 
  in the face of globalization. But they explain their position with Marxist 
  jargon-global division of labor, transnational class formation for which 
  capital, at current stage, can not be explained by state and social classes 
  confined within national boundary. Like neoliberals, they consider technology 
  as the determining factor. This is reflected in their approach to characterize 
  this new brand of capitalism by using special phrases like 'Informational 
  capitalism', 'network society' etc. (Manual Castells). Some has directly 
  claimed that it is not imperialism, it is globalization that is, at present, 
  the highest stage of capitalism. </p>
  <p>Conclusion </p>
  <p>In our finding capitalism is born global. And there is no doubt that 
  computer technology has accelerated the speed of the transfer of capital, 
  goods and technology in different parts of the world and occupied more 
  non-capitalist space. The claims of the globalists is unreal-an overstated 
  portrait of capitalism. The structure of capitalism has not changed. Also, 
  nation-state , especially the imperial states remains, as usual, the chief 
  actor in capitalist expansion. It is not the technology, it is politics in 
  command that decides the movement of capital, its accumulation thorough the 
  world. It is class interests pursued by the agencies like multinational 
  corporations, international financial institutions and other politico-military 
  organizations backed by the powerful imperial nation-state as we have shown 
  with empirical evidence. </p>
  <p>Globalization is charged with the ideology of neoliberalism presenting a 
  fresh version of capitalism as something inevitable and egalitarian. It 
  distorts reality by hiding contradictions and thus negating struggles of the 
  victims against imperialism. Globalism, the thesis of &quot;one world&quot; does not 
  explain contemporary capitalist world order. It is imperialism that better 
  explains the capitalist world-a world historically divided by the rich and 
  poor. The relation is still that of dominators and dominated. Ownership and 
  control of international organization, military network of the imperial 
  states, as we have shown, has always been one-sided. Therefore, the 
  &quot;interdependent&quot; world of the globalists does not exist. World inequalities in 
  the domestics economies of North and South and disparity between the rich and 
  poor are increasing. Human environment is more threatened. Even statistical 
  evidence from capitalist sources suggests that the that world is getting more 
  polarized. I! t is not the business of the wild wide web of gobalism to fill 
  up the gap created by the social injustice. To undermine the analytical format 
  of world imperialism is to betray the historical necessity of social struggle 
  for human emancipation. </p>
