  Globalization And The Agenda For A Free And Democratic South Asia </span>

  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" size="4"><b>By Anu Muhammad</b></font>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This part of the world, the South 
  Asia, is the most populous area of the globe. The region is rich in many ways, 
  yet this is the region with the highest concentration of poverty, simultaneous 
  alarming rise of religious fascists and expansion of militarism, with 
  intensification of religious and ethnic conflicts. More than forty per cent of 
  absolutely poor people in the world live in south Asia, yet India the super 
  power of the region has the 4th largest army on its head, while another 
  poor-burdened Pakistan has the 6th largest army, so is their budget on 
  defense. Both India and Pakistan together have the highest concentration of 
  poverty, yet the ruling classes are keener in building war machines. They 
  prefer to make atomic bombs, not to expand atomic power to ease lives of the 
  billion. The ruling classes opt for this priority setting because that helps 
  to perpetuate the system and to accumulate of private wealth. There is no need 
  to elaborate the fact here that this priority of South Asian ruling classes is 
  inseparable with the present day global capitalism and imperialism. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today we are confronting biggest 
  terrorist offences around the world from the US led imperialist alliance. This 
  continuous terror and war-cry are on the one hand an organic expression of 
  permanent war economy of capitalism and a desperate attempt of the US to 
  ensure domination over the earth on the other. Capitalism has become truly a 
  global system in this phase of global history and much more potentially 
  destructive. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Globalization of Capitalism: New 
  Elements </font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This globalization of capitalism has 
  been consistent with the conclusions derived by Karl Marx after anatomical 
  investigation of capitalism in its early stage after mid 19th century. He 
  showed in number of works the objective nature of capitalism that is 
  expansionary-reproductive and an international system from the very beginning. 
  Marx had foreseen a global capitalist system, which is a reality today. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By 1916, V I Lenin had developed a 
  theoretical framework and insights to understand Imperialism. After more than 
  eight decades, his work on imperialism is still relevant to understand, 
  analyze and wage struggle against imperialism. But since changes in many areas 
  have occurred, we need to look beyond this classic. As revolutionaries, we do 
  not forget that in order to change the world we have to go for concrete 
  analysis of the concrete reality. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If we compare the level of 
  concentration, nature of monopoly finance capital we would find a clear 
  continuity of the imperialist system from the early 20th century. But the new 
  elements have also emerged in the process, which deserve attention. The 
  institutional set up of the global imperialist system is one of the most 
  important new phenomena. I would like to summarily present five points in this 
  regard. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Firstly, in 1916, other than colonial 
  powers in the west and the east most of the remaining areas were colonies. 
  Today these colonies have turned into several independent states that gave 
  local ruling classes a legal authority and a greater space to become a part of 
  international ruling class. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Secondly, emergence of international 
  bodies muscled with global authority has initiated a new form of global 
  governance with participation from the ruling classes of the centre as well as 
  periphery. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thirdly, these international bodies, 
  e.g., the World Bank, the IMF, the WTO, the ADB and the UN agencies have 
  usurped the managerial role of the global capitalist system. They have emerged 
  as a legitimate body to intervene, manipulate and determine a countrys course 
  of politics and economics. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fourthly, GATT agreement in 1995 has 
  opened up the world for multinational corporations and gave a legal basis to 
  privatize common properties in favour of international monopoly capital.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fifthly, the peripheral State bodies 
  have become essentially nothing more than implementing agencies of the 
  policies determined by the international capital and its agencies. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this scenario, imperialism works in 
  a country like Bangladesh also from within and through legalized legitimized 
  bodies. Imperialism is not something only coming from outside with military 
  power. The ruling classes within and its institutions, through several contact 
  and contracts and with so-called sovereign bodies work as the junior partner 
  or local version of international ruling class, i.e., imperialism. Therefore 
  anti-imperialist movement is today more linked with the class struggles along 
  with struggles against gender ethnicity caste religious discrimination within 
  and beyond border than ever before. Globalization of capitalism has 
  contributed to develop ruling classes as well as oppressed classes, content 
  and discontent at a global scale. At this stage, interdependence of struggles 
  in global scale has intensified. The increasing collaboration of ruling 
  classes (in the form of unity and conflict) demands much more increasing 
  collaboration (in the form of unity in thoughts and in struggles) from the 
  democratic and revolutionary forces. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh: more integrated </font>
  </b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh, in the process of deeper 
  integration in global capitalism, has been experiencing several changes and 
  unchanges. During the last three decades, Bangladesh has experienced different 
  forms of governments: Civil and Military, Parliamentary and Presidential. 
  Despite the changes in political power and governance and the bloody conflicts 
  among groups wishing to govern, the economic front experienced a continuity of 
  policy and ideology. Both the changes and the continuities are important to 
  the understanding of the internal dynamics and external effects influencing 
  Bangladesh. At the time of independence, Bangladeshs society, both rural and 
  urban, was mostly composed of small owners: petty traders, low and 
  middle-income professionals, small and medium farmers, small entrepreneurs. 
  Except large farmers and jotedars big propertied class based on industry or on 
  trade was almost non-existent. That societal composition has radically been 
  changed during the last three decades. Big propertied multimillionaires have 
  grown in number to thousands in this period. However, this super rich class 
  has either little or negative relations with the growth of productive bases.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In rural areas landless people has 
  grown in number and proportion too. As a class, they emerged as a group of 
  single majority of the population. A large segment of this, however, has been 
  delinked from farm work. Migration to urban areas happened mostly from this 
  group. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While industrial labour pool shrunk in 
  size, new workers change its gender composition. Women workers have become a 
  significant part of the present working class. In addition to that, the growth 
  of the informal sector gave rise to the floating labourer, low paying and 
  insecure all the time. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After its first three decades, we find 
  Bangladesh is more marketized, more globalized, and more urbanized; and, has a 
  good number of super rich and increased number of uprooted poor people. We 
  also smell increasing role of international agencies in governance of the 
  state, see increasing presence of funding organizations including corporate 
  NGOs. Role of the state in major policy formulation is rather marginal, though 
  actively functional as repressive machine. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today a four party alliance has formed 
  the ruling government with two third majority in the parliament. The alliance 
  comprises Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jamat-i- Islami, Jatiyo Party 
  and Islami Oikyo Jote. This four party alliance is known to be pro-Islamic 
  and anti-Indian. But it is important to note that, because of its strong 
  pro-imperialist position the steps and policies taken by the alliance 
  government, especially in economic sector, gave Indian big business a good 
  foot into Bangladesh. It is no wonder that, even under pro-Islamic and 
  anti-Indian government, Bangladesh continues to be appendix of Indian 
  economy. Anti-Indian communal politics and pro-Indian liberal economics go 
  hand in hand in Bangladesh. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Imperialism and the Indian hegemony 
  in the region </font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India, being a huge country in the 
  region, has accumulated authority to behave as a super power in South Asia. 
  Indian state has also become a regional centre of global capitalism. US 
  imperialism finds Indian State as a strong regional ally. Its role represents 
  on the one hand most consolidated and developed bourgeoisie in the region and 
  as an ally of global capitalism on the other. Therefore, in this region, any 
  anti-imperialist struggle cannot escape struggle against Indian economic, 
  political and cultural hegemony. On the other hand any struggle against Indian 
  hegemony without linking it with anti-imperialist struggle would bind to be 
  blind and misleading. With the so-called economic reform projects sponsored 
  by global agencies like the World Bank, IMF, WTO and ADB have opened the 
  region for international capital, i.e., MNCs. In regional strategy of the MNCs 
  India emerges as a centre and therefore joint collaboration with Indian big 
  business bring India-US joint invasion in the region. In most of the cases, 
  global corporate bodies prefer to invade in the region through Indian big 
  corporate bodies. The policies and prescriptions of the global agencies, 
  therefore, stand for this alliance. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Agenda for Peoples Counter Hegemony
  </font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this setting, in order to change 
  our lives, present and future, we need to have much more clear vision and 
  coordinated efforts on the part of revolutionaries and the social activists. 
  Here, because of the position of India in the region, the role of Indian left 
  and democratic forces is crucial. However, in order to take things forward, we 
  should not suppress our feelings as well as experience in this regard. That 
  is, unfortunately, not very optimistic. Left in India, in general, has played 
  much less than what has been required. In many cases on the part of Indian 
  left, nationalistic and chauvinistic attitude towards smaller countries 
  reduced many of them into the leftist partner of the ruling classes. There are 
  revolutionaries in India who have long tradition of glorious struggle but have 
  little attention to the peoples struggle in neighboring countries. This 
  indifference not only affects peoples struggle in other countries but it 
  affects badly even ongoing struggles within India. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Everybody who strive for a change 
  would certainly agree that because of geographical location, common colonial 
  experience, regional common tread in environment and livelihood, 
  interdependence of peoples struggle the democratic forces have no other way 
  but to think and act on regional basis with mutual respect and cooperation.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We should come closer to know each 
  other, to talk, to debate with each other and to work collectively. I would 
  suggest certain important area to explore and immediate initiatives: </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1.We need to develop a vision of free 
  democratic South Asia in line with a free democratic globe. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2.We need to work on building a model 
  of the best utilization of regional energy, water, forest, and manpower 
  resources on regional basis to maximize benefit for the people as a whole. It 
  would be an alternative to the model being developed by the Global agencies 
  and corporate bodies and supported by local rent seekers to maximize profit at 
  the cost of sustainable resource management. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3.We need to develop our ideas and 
  coordinate our struggle against religious, caste, and class, regional, gender 
  discrimination, imperialism and fascist rules. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We, the democratic and revolutionary 
  forces in the region, have definitely failed to make revolutionary changes, 
  but we have nevertheless succeeded to make many changes. Our failure have 
  definite causes, we need to identify that. Imperialism, global monopoly 
  capitalism have been doing everything to expand their globalization, but in 
  the process, dialectically, globalization of the oppressed people all over the 
  world has been taking shape through increasingly globalized struggle. We have 
  to discover the potential and conditions of creating alternative world through 
  intensifying and coordinating these struggles to a definite direction. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We need to change the present 
  scenario, because we need human progress in Bangladesh, so is for India, 
  Pakistan, Nepal, Srilanka and Bhutan. To arrive at a free and democratic South 
  Asia end of Indian hegemony in the region is absolutely essential; essential 
  is the end of fascist racist forces in different forms and the end of 
  imperialist cancerous presence in every country. Let us work together to 
  achieve this goal without further delay. </font></p>
