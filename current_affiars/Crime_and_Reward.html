  Crime and Reward: Immunity To The World Bank </span></font></b></p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The government of Bangladesh has 
  submitted a bill seeking legal immunity for multilateral lending agencies, 
  especially the World Bank on 31st October 2004 in the national parliament. 
  Finance Minister M Saifur Rahman introduced the bill titled “The International 
  Financial Organisations Order (Amendment) Act 2004”. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to the press report (New 
  Age, 1 November 2004) the said minister although admitted that there was no 
  precedence of such immunity nevertheless insisted for it. The above bill 
  described that, “The Bank shall enjoy immunity from every form of legal 
  process...no action shall be brought against the Bank, by any agency, or by 
  any entity or person, and there shall be recourse to such special procedures 
  for the settlement of controversies between the Bank and the government or the 
  agency or entity or person as the case may be....Property and assets of the 
  Bank shall wheresoever located and by whomsoever held be immune from all forms 
  of seizure, attachment or execution, before the delivery of final judgement 
  against the Bank.” No legal action is allowed against the activities of 
  employees as long as they act in an official capacity at the directive of the 
  lending agency. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
  and the Asian development Bank (ADB) were given immunity earlier in 1972 and 
  1973; the World Bank was then given the partial. Now the government of 
  Bangladesh has taken an initiative not to correct the wrong but to complete 
  the wrong, to give full immunity to the World Bank. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The World Bank formally asked the 
  government for the legal immunity about three years ago. It was reported that 
  the World Bank (WB) became impatient to get a complete immunity in Bangladesh. 
  Why? What it has done for which it needs immunity to save its skin? Why the 
  government is moving fast to give complete immunity to the World Bank? Why the 
  government needs to protect the Bank? What makes the champion of transparency 
  and development nervous of the court and public scrutiny? Is it only to keep 
  reported internal irregularities under carpet or more? We are concerned for 
  reasons I would like to explain. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Projects of Development or 
  Destruction? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since 1972 the World Bank along with 
  IMF, ADB and other international agencies has been playing a leading role in 
  formulating policies and monitoring implementation of its agenda. In different 
  ways it has been working to influence the direction of the economy of 
  countries like Bangladesh according to the needs and ideology of global power.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have thousands of projects 
  conceived and monitored by the World Bank and/or its allies in different 
  fields. The projects for energy development, poverty reduction, forestation, 
  flood control and irrigation, education, health, industry, financial sector 
  and what not? We are made overburdened by loans and our hard earned currencies 
  go to pay the interest every year. But what brings the projects? What results 
  came from these projects? We have plenty of projects and we have increased 
  number of people living under poverty line, we have permanent water logging 
  and more frequent floods after implementing several flood control projects, we 
  have arsenic in the water around the country after successful and failed 
  implementation of projects of ground water, we get monocrop after losing 
  diverse agriculture and poisonous production boom through implementing 
  projects in agriculture, we lost our authority over our natural gas resources 
  and we now pay more for gas and electricity after implementation of energy 
  projects, we find huge coastal area permanently damaged after implementing 
  shrimp projects, we find loss of natural forests because of implementing 
  foreign currency earning projects, we have vulnerable public sector education 
  and health to see growth of handicapped but expensive private sector, we find 
  basic industry like steel mills and large jute mills closed after implementing 
  projects concerning growth and industry! People have been suffering, material 
  and human loss is unaccountable. People of Bangladesh are made more indebted 
  for these projects and made more vulnerable. But, we know, there are 
  beneficiaries of these projects. The rich and powerful, local and foreign, 
  have gained a lot from these. The vulgar growth of super rich in a ‘poor’ 
  country has direct links with these projects. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then who will be accountable for these 
  projects? What about the evaluation of the past not to repeat disasters? No 
  money, no initiative from the powerful for that. Projects, bigger is better, 
  bring money, bring beautiful cars, and give fatty lives to consultants, 
  commission agents-ministers-bureaucrats and business elites. Projects like the 
  above ensure market for big corporate bodies, projects helps to expand space 
  for them, it gives life time heavenly life for international consultants and 
  bureaucrats of the agencies like the World Bank. In the latest move by the 
  agency, PRSP (read: poverty re(pro)duction strategy paper), a new 
  comprehensive assault on the people is on the making in a similar line of the 
  ‘development efforts’ so far. The local beneficiaries are also excited about 
  that. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Steps Towards Grabbing </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have plenty of records to show the 
  real direction of the projects and the face of the development agencies. I 
  discussed earlier on manufacturing sector (“Closure of manufacturing units and 
  the victory of Anti-Industrial Development Projects”), water and flood control 
  projects (“Projects of Mass Destruction”) and on Foreign Direct Investment 
  (Global coalition and FDI) where I found the World Bank as a key player. Here 
  let me shed some light on a specific area: energy sector the area of power and 
  natural gas to understand the steps of the agency. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First elaborate discourse by the World 
  Bank on Energy sector of Bangladesh was made in 1982. It was a report of the 
  Joint World Bank/UNDP Energy Sector Assessment Program. The report was kept 
  secret in the same line with most of other reports of these agencies. This 
  report was based on the findings of the Energy Assessment Mission undertaken 
  during October 1981. The report seemed certain about the size of the gas 
  reserves, even though no scientific analysis was cited. Even 10tcf gas was 
  considered as “substantial economically recoverable natural gas reserves” and 
  according to their estimate “at present consumption levels would last for 
  several decades.” The report also suggested creating atmosphere to entry of 
  multinational oil companies. Moreover, it continued, since “the supply of gas 
  is likely to remain well in excess of Bangladesh’s expected internal needs for 
  a substantial period of time” they offered different export options including 
  “export gas through a pipeline to India”. So, the issue of disastrous 
  production sharing contracts and exporting gas is not a recent phenomenon, the 
  option was prescribed two decades ago by the World Bank et al. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A similar scenario can be seen in 
  power generation and distribution. How the Government, Rural Electrification 
  Board (REB) and Palli Bidyut Samity (PBS), have been coming into terms and 
  where the World Bank and its window International Development Association 
  (IDA) stand in the process are the matters of importance to understand the 
  ‘development’ in Power sector. Both REB and PBS were born through earlier 
  projects. Agreements with IDA and undertakings obtained from the government 
  might help in this regard. According to the agreements, the report of the 
  World Bank of 1982 says, “(1) GOB will lend Credit proceeds to REB, and REB 
  will transfer assets to PBSs, on terms satisfactory to IDA, and the local 
  component of project cost will be provided by GOB to REB as a grant.... (2) 
  GOB will cover any deficit from REB’s operation in future. (3) GOB will 
  initially subsidize the difference between an agreed bulk tariff for BPDB 
  supply to PBSs, and PBS payments based on their ability to recover costs, 
  according to a formula satisfactory to IDA. (4) GOB will submit to IDA, by 
  December 31, 1982, a satisfactory formula to calculate and adjust the BPDB 
  bulk tariff to PBSs, and BPDB to implement it thereafter”. The agreement 
  confirmed all conditionality of the World Bank to begin a ‘power transmission 
  network’ with the Government and the BPDB as the bearer of all excess costs 
  ‘satisfactory to IDA’. Huge subsidy from the people to the corporate bodies!
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In October 1996, as a follow-up of 
  similar other projects, the Government of Bangladesh approved a private sector 
  power generation policy (PPGP). Its essence was that new power generation 
  capacity would be created through multinational corporations in power sector 
  usually called as Independent Power Producer (IPP). And the new power 
  generators would be constructed on a Build- Own- Operate (BOO) basis. Although 
  there was “absence of prior experience by the Power Cell (a newly set window 
  under energy ministry, GOB) in dealing with IPP projects” projects have been 
  taken temporarily by the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) “in 
  inviting and finalizing bids from IPPs”. Finally, the World Bank made its 
  ‘expectation’ clear that in the future only the Power Cell would be processing 
  Independent Power Producer projects. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To make investment in Bangladesh’s 
  power sector an attractive opportunity for multinational corporations, the 
  World Bank offered a number of prescriptions in 1997. These included: (1) the 
  commercialization of BPDB’s generation assets and establishment of profit 
  centers; (2) the commercialization and corporatization of the distribution 
  units; (3) private sector participation by way of rehabilitation, operation 
  and maintenance (ROM) contracts in selected profit centers; and (4) BPDB’s 
  proposed direct investment in four public sector power generation projects (Barapukuria 
  coal based, Shahjibazar, Baghabari, Sylhet gas turbines) to be postponed and 
  these to be carried out through IPPs. These asked, in clear terms, to 
  dismantle another public sector institution and to clear path for the 
  multinational companies in power sector, i.e., IPPs and to subsidize these 
  efforts by public money. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Things proceeded accordingly. After 
  IPPs were given contracts the cost of electricity to the citizens of 
  Bangladesh, as happened with the gas, also increased by more than 200 percent. 
  And similar to the experience of the state agency for gas exploration and 
  distribution (Petrobangla), which was given responsibility to purchase gas 
  from multinational oil companies at a higher price with foreign exchange, BPDB, 
  the state agency for power production and distribution, was also given the 
  same task. As a consequence, Bangladesh Power Development Board joined 
  Petrobangla in incurring losses. This pattern was already evident by 1998. 
  Since then, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have applied 
  pressure to ensure payments occurred to the multinational corporations. This 
  is usual lobbying. It should not be taken as surprising that the Bank, kept 
  mum on the compensation payment from UNOCAL to Bangladesh due for many years 
  which is more than tk 60 billion. On the contrary, it put all strength to 
  close down Adamjee jute mills and through away about 100 thousand people under 
  poverty line accusing it for making loss of tk 12 billion in 30 years! </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since mid 90s, foreign direct 
  investment increased dramatically. Presence of Multinational Corporations (MNCs) 
  in gas, electricity, hybrid and telecommunication became visible, and new 
  contracts were being signed in gas, telecommunication and power sectors. After 
  working long to pave the way for this anti-development foreign direct 
  investment, the World Bank shifted its emphasis for gas sector. In 1999, the 
  World Bank stated that the nature of foreign direct investment “has implied 
  little augmentation of foreign exchange reserves”, because, “the bulk of FDI 
  in the power sector so far is made up of imports (e.g. pre-fabricated barge 
  mounted power plants); so are capital costs of IOCs engaged in the gas sector, 
  and much of the foreign investment and lending in the telecom sector finance 
  imports of telecommunications equipment”. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The World Bank, therefore, made it 
  clear that, “the import intensity of FDI inflows and subsequent profit 
  repatriation and interest payments imply a worsening current account deficit 
  associated with FDI.” In order to understand reasons behind World Bank’s 
  unusual recognition of adverse effects of foreign direct investment in 
  Bangladesh one has to go further to read their suggestion: “there is no 
  discernible accumulation of foreign exchange reserves in the absence of gas 
  exports”. The prescription offered in 1982, i.e., export of gas, appeared as a 
  compulsion in 1999. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, if we sketch the steps 
  taken by the World Bank and its allies in the energy sector we find the 
  following: </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Step 1: Study on Energy to provide a 
  policy prescription to restructure and downsize public institutions in order 
  to create space for others. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Step 2: Argument followed that the 
  foreign private investment would provide an inflow of foreign currency, would 
  ensure remarkable development of the energy sector and would contribute to 
  develop other sectors as well. Precondition of this was to downsize or 
  dismantling public institutions. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Step 3: Constant advocacy for raising 
  price of gas and electricity. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Step 4: Gas blocks awarded to the 
  Multinational Corporations. According to the contract, Bangladesh is bound to 
  purchase its own gas with more than double of present price and with foreign 
  currency. National exploration agency has been kept idle. Budget deficit and 
  negative effect on foreign exchange reserve increased. Similar things happened 
  in power sector. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Step 5: Further increase of the price 
  of gas and power, export of gas are prescribed to avert further crisis and to 
  ensure further development. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The results of these steps have been 
  disastrous for the economy and the people. Because, (1) price of gas and power 
  on a continuous increase, as a result of that (2) cost of production in every 
  level increased which resulted fall in competitiveness of Bangladeshi goods; 
  (3) hard earned currency are being used to purchase gas and electricity which 
  could be bought with local currency at a much cheaper rate (4) dismantling of 
  local production skill and exploration establishment; (5) losses of BPDB and 
  Petrobangla becoming huge; (6) common property becomes private property being 
  used to maximize profit and (7) public resource like natural gas becomes huge 
  liability. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is a pattern of doings of the 
  World Bank and its allies, a ‘road map’ to ensure businesses to big corporate 
  bodies by creating a myth that they are working for the people and development 
  of the poor countries. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">USGAO reports on the US body </font>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nobody would deny, considering facts, 
  that the World Bank, despite its rhetoric, is effectively an extension of US 
  administration. It was born in the US, it is compulsorily headed by a US 
  citizen and all of its decision is influenced or monitored by the US 
  administration, the US treasury in particular. This assertion is documented by 
  a report prepared by United States General Accountant Office (USGAO) that 
  investigated the World Bank’s operations and policy implementation 
  performance. The report says that the World Bank operations support the US 
  economic and foreign policy. It shows the link between the Bank and the US 
  government clear, &quot;through the Secretary of the Treasury and the US Executive 
  Director, the United States influences the Bank to take actions consistent 
  with the US post-Cold War foreign policy agenda.... The Bank promotes economic 
  development consistent with the US interests”. According to the report 
  published in the US media “for every $1 contributed to the World Bank and IDA 
  over the years, the country (US) got roughly $2 back in business for American 
  firms that bid on contracts involved in providing this aid.” This is much more 
  in many cases in Bangladesh. The World Bank, therefore, can be viewed as the 
  US institution, that takes care of the US corporate investment, and works as 
  an instrument to bargain with different countries to protect the US imperial 
  interest. So, the Bank, in other words, is obligated not to promote any kind 
  of development, which is inconsistent with the US and other corporate 
  interests. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The World Bank’s project performance 
  reviews often present devastating pictures. Such a conclusion was also noted 
  by the USGAO. After investigating many projects around the world the 
  organization also observed that, “in terms of achieving project objectives, 
  the Bank’s rate of success is much higher in meeting physical objectives 
  (e.g., completing buildings and administering social services) than in 
  improving market and policy conditions for economic growth.” In fact, the 
  discussions on success or failure of projects sometime ignore the World Bank’s 
  agenda. The agenda is acknowledged in World Bank’s own documents that indicate 
  that the Bank was structured to ‘promote private foreign investment’. The 
  documents continued by stating that the Bank “has many of the characteristics 
  of a private sector institution. It is organized as a stock corporation, with 
  voting rights proportional to equity investment. It finances itself in private 
  capital markets, through medium-and long term bond issues on commercial terms, 
  applying conservative financial policies that have earned and preserved a 
  triple-A bond rating...It has consistently earned a profit over $1billion ”
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Corruption and Immunity to the 
  Coalition </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The World Bank always tries to make 
  point against corruption, tries to show that they are pursuing programmes to 
  curb corruption in Bangladesh and elsewhere. Wrong! History and geography show 
  that never nowhere the World Bank feels happy with the governments who really 
  want to end corruption. Corruption is huge in Bangladesh, but that is why the 
  Bank find here very strong support base. How can institutions like this 
  survive without the life support of corrupts? How can otherwise the projects 
  World Bank pursues be endorsed? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact the World Bank does enjoy the 
  status of ‘sovereign body’, entering everywhere but no accountability. It 
  appears that the agency needs now to have that status as legally valid. The 
  present government’s move to give immunity to the World Bank is not 
  inconsistent. It is also consistent with its recent agreement with the US 
  government to give immunity to the US nationals (especially US Army) from any 
  trial for their crime (planning to commit?) in Bangladesh. Government 
  spokesmen, ministers Saifur Rahman and Moudud Ahmed in particular, recently 
  defended strongly the immunity move by saying that responsibility of all the 
  projects lie with the government. Very much true, indeed! The governments, 
  present and past, are primarily responsible for all disasters made through 
  development projects and otherwise. They must explain and should stand before 
  trial. Then why the immunity law? Why legal procedure is being restricted? Let 
  the court identify responsible parties and the degree of their crime. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We understand their problem. A 
  coalition is there which smells trouble in the air. World Bank along with 
  other agencies, local policymakers i.e., ministers, bureaucrats, consultants, 
  commission agents are the honourable members of the coalition. It seems that 
  all of those need to keep all things away from any public scrutiny; they need 
  to seal for ever the possibility of opening the Pandora’s Box to show the ugly 
  faces! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But even if government gives immunity 
  people will not. There are number of public trials already held in different 
  parts of the world. The number will increase at a faster rate. The global 
  institutions like the World Bank, by their worldwide similar operations, 
  invite affected billions of people to raise voice against them, to create 
  global resistance. Immunity will not be able to save them from that people 
  power nor will the local goons, the beneficiary groups, be spared for ever.</font></p>
