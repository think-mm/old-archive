  youths for weekly discussions on issues ranging from the ideal way of child 
  rearing to modern theories of literature and philosophy through a rational 
  outlook.&nbsp; Dr. Sharif donated his&nbsp; 
  corneas  to two blind men - Hafez Khairul Alam Khokan from Madaripur

  Dr. Ahmed Sharif, the prominent figure of free thought country died just a 
  year back. The scholarly life of Dr. Ahmed Sharif, a retired professor of 
  Bengali literature of the University of Dhaka, came to an end on his way to 
  hospital at 1.40 a.m. on February 24, 1999. A massive heart attack brought the 
  end to the life which begun on February 13, 1921.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  He was a consummate rational humanist who left behind a legacy for those still 
  fighting fascist ideas, autocratic views, communalism and superstition. 
  Whatever he said or wrote during his lifetime caused a lot of furore in 
  intellectual circles. Even till his last days, he had been living a secluded 
  life to avoid the wrath of a section of the public who thought his views to be 
  too dangerous for the establishment. During his lifetime, he was very much 
  controversial and misunderstood personality among his contemporaries in the 
  country. He was controversial because of his outspoken views against the 
  establishment, so-called intellectuals and political leaders, and above all 
  religious and parochial outlooks. He never attended any government-sponsored 
  and elite programmes. Therefore, his huge publications on different issues 
  were not read. Because of professional jealousy, opportunists used to 
  misinterpret him to the curious people, who wanted to know Dr Sharif's 
  philosophy and works.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Dr Ahmed Sharif who came from Patiya, Chittagong, did his Masters and Ph. D 
  degrees in Bangla literature from the University of Dhaka, in 1944 and 1967 
  respectively. From 1945 to 1949, he taught at Laksham Nawab Faizunnessa 
  College and later on at Feni College. From July 1949 to 17th December 1950 he 
  worked as Programme Assistant at the Dhaka Centre of the Radio Pakistan. 
  Finally, on December 18, 1950 he joined as Research Assistant in the Bengali 
  Department, University of Dhaka and retired as Chairman and Professor in 1983. 
  During his time at the DU he was elected a member of the Senate, Syndicate, 
  and the President of Teachers Association and the University Teachers Club. 
  Dr. Sharif remained the only person who was elected the Dean of the Faculty of 
  Arts for three consecutive terms. After his retirement from the Dhaka 
  University, he was offered to join as first &quot;Kazi Nazrul Islam Professor&quot; at 
  the University of Chittagong, where he served from 1984 to 1986.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the recipient of many honours and awards for his outstanding 
  contribution in the field of medieval Bengali literature and contemporary 
  socio-cultural-political essays.<br>
  <br>
  He was considered the lone authority on ancient and medieval Bengali 
  literature. He authored more than 100 research publications - in the form of 
  books - on history, philosophy, socio-cultural and contemporary political 
  issues. He edited with long introductions of 46 manuscripts of ancient and 
  medieval Bengali literature and many others were in joint collaboration. It is 
  rated by the sub-continental scholars that two volumes of his Bangalee and 
  Bangla Shahitya are masterpieces. It may be mentioned here that during his 
  lifetime he wrote almost 34611 pages in total and all his hand written pages 
  stand at 13844 pages in print. Never did he care for appreciation or publicity 
  for his massive scholarly works.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  However, many believe that one of his major achievements was that, he unlike 
  many of his contemporary scholars and academicians, had been able to extract 
  the hatred and enmity of reactionary forces by the bold expression of his own 
  views. He was highly regarded for his ability to say &quot;no&quot; to various material 
  temptations. His dignity and self-respect never permitted him to be submissive 
  to any power. Among his Dhaka University colleagues he was just an impractical 
  man, a cynic seized with radical ideas who was never &quot;clever&quot; enough to 
  understand his own mundane interests as he never took any undue advantage of 
  his position.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike many, he rose above all religious and parochial outlooks towards life. 
  For his brave utterances against communalism, superstitions, autocracy and 
  fascism his life came under threat many times, but he never stopped.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  He may not be with us today, but he will be remembered because of his ideas, 
  secular thoughts, boldness and modern outlook.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I remember still clearly the 
name of the following teachers of Dhaka University who spearheaded the movement 
for Autonomy for University and other educational institutions during sixties 
before 6-point demand of Sheikh Mujib and 11-pont demands of the students. The 
object of our movement, later came to be known as “Drohi” was to establish an 
atmosphere of free thinking where we, the teachers and students can cultivate 
free intellectual pursuit in a liberal atmosphere. Our movement reached its peak 
during 1969 and coincided with national movement for autonomy. The teachers who 
led the movement are:</p>
