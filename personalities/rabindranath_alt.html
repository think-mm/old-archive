  <p>Dear Readers, </p>
  <p>I have found the following article on Rabindranath in the Net quite 
  interesting. I think this article is not a simple &quot;ranting&quot; that <b>
  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/5865">Md. Abdullah 
  made before in NFB</a></b>. The author claims that compilation of excerpts 
  taken from books and essays mostly written by Calcatian &quot;hindu&quot; writers and 
  some Rabindra Researchers of Bangladesh including Ahmed Sharif, Humayun Azad 
  etc and they criticized Rabi Thakur for having &quot;communal mind-set&quot; from a 
  valid ground. Readers are requested to read the article carefully and comment 
  from their knowledge. </p>

  <small><font size="3">Rabindranath Tagore had always been portrayed larger 
  than his life. Hardly people tried or dared to criticize him of his 
  shortcomings. Those who tried to do so failed to propound sufficient 
  supportive arguments. I have taken the trouble of crudely translating some 
  excerpts I collected over the last few years. I wanted to share these with the 
  readers. I am yet to read about <font color="#800080"><b>Prof Humayun Azad's 
  book 'Nari' where he exposed Rabindranath's anti-feminist views</b></font>.<br>
  <br>
  After I read a nice article written by one Muhammad Alamgir, I though about 
  elaborating certain points with quotes from Hindu writers. Following is 
  basically a compilation of excerpts taken from books and essays mostly written 
  by Calcatian hindu writers who are basically Rabindra researchers. I hope some 
  readers would be benefited by this.</font><br>

  <font size="2">&quot;Rabindranath discussed about this Hindu-Muslim issue during 
  the census of 1819. He said, '<b><font color="#800080">I was born in a Hindu 
  family, but accepted Brahmo religion</font></b>. ... The religion we accepted 
  is universal in nature; however, it is <font color="#800080"><b>basically the 
  religion of the Hindus</b></font>. We accepted this universal religion with 
  the heart of Hindus.&quot; [Probhatkumar Mukharjee, Rabindrajiboni O 
  Rabindrashahityo Probeyshok, vol 3, 3rd ed., published by Biswa Bharati 
  Publishing Division in Poush 1395, pp.364-365].<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Tapobon Bidyala (school), a ashram established to instill ancient hindu 
  ideology, took the shade of hindutva. Tagore started to turn himself into a 
  very devout hindu. Gradually, casteism-based aparthied, injunctions of Manu 
  Sanghita, and Brahminic glorification crept into their way into the school 
  environ. <font color="#800080"><b>Tagore decreed that a non-Brahmin teacher 
  did not deserve salutation (pronam) from his Brahmin students. In a letter 
  written to Manoranjan Banerjee in Agrahayan 19, 1309 Tagore clarified his 
  position on the issue of salutation in these words, 'No non-hindu customs 
  would be allowed into this school</b></font>; It is imperative that students 
  express their respect to Brahmin professors by touching their feet (pronum) 
  and utter namasker to non-Brahmin teachers as per the rules set aside by Manu 
  Sanghita.' &quot; [Satyendranath Roy, 'Rabindra Manoney Hindu Dharma', The Desh, 
  Autumn issue, 1905, p.305]<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Tagore established Biswa Bharati to re-vitalize ancient &quot;hindu customs&quot; and 
  ideology. In this effort, Hindi Bhavan (Building) was established in 
  Shantiniketan on January 16 (sunday), 1938 (Magh 2, 1344). It is of no 
  surprise that Tagore had very close friendship with Pundit Madonmohan Malabya 
  -- a prominent leader of Kashi Hindu University and Hindu Mohashava.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#800080"><b>When asked about the usefulness of Hindu Mohashava, 
  Tagore said that he considered this movement more important than a mere 
  political undertaking. 'Hindus would have to unite if they want to remain 
  alive and not remain downtrodden for ever in the human society.'</b></font>

  in 1894 he raised the tax levied on his subjects. He even purchased new 
  Zamindari from the Martin Company. There had been incidents of rebellion by 
  the subjects due to raising of tax and collection of tax by force. Tagore

  did not believe the Muslims. Hindu interests wouldn't be looked after under 
  Muslim majority rule -- wasn't this the reason? <font color="#800080"><b>Were

  &quot;In the Jaistha, 1343 issue of the Mohammadi magazine, a writer protested 
  about the inclusion of some objectionable items in the Matriculation Bengali

  A communal poet like Tagore used to be glorified with full vigour in the 
  electronic media during the second Awami regime that left behind the darkest 
  chapter in the history of Bangladesh in every walk of life. Hindus don't 
  suffer from inferiority complex. As such, they don't glorify any Muslim poet 
  during their puja festivals. Durga puja programmes are shown with much more 
  pomp and grandeur in BTV than Eid festivals in a Muslim majority country like 
  Bangladesh. At this, Awami pigheaded intellectuals exclaim, &quot;Aha! How 
  beautiful is the hindu religion?&quot; But when Muslims utter any islamic word in 
  their religious programmes, this cabal term it as fundamentalism and 
  communalism.<br>

  based on the ancient Brahmo mythological legends and chronological narratives

  or dervishes arriving from foreign lands or the magnanimity of Muslim rulers 
  did not seem worthy of his consideration -- not even those of Emperor Akbar, 
  Moinuddin Chisti, Razia, Anarkoli, Nurjahan. Nothing (except Tajmahal) of a 
  nation or society that ruled India with might, knowledge, wealth and 
  achievements for previous 600 years appealed to his good sense. <b>

  <font size="2"><b><font color="#800080">In the novel Gora, Rabindranath Tagore 
  subtly expressed his hatred toward Muslims through a statement of his hero 
  Gora who addressed his oppressed Muslims subjects in these words -- &quot;<i>Your 
  Mohammad did not preach the religion in a good manner.</i>&quot;</font></b><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Litteratuer Motahar Hossain Choudhury once asked Rabindranath on the premises 
  of Shanti Niketon, &quot;How come there is no mention of Islam or the prophet in 
  your writings?&quot; Replied the poet, <font color="#800080"><b>&quot;I started to read 
  Quran but could not advance much. Besides, I did not like the character of 
  rasul.&quot;</b></font> [Culled from an essay 'Islami Shangskritir Ruprekha'

  </small><br>
  <small><font size="2">&quot;Honourable Prime Minister [Sheikh Hasina] urged to take 
  the philosophy of Tagore to every door. But what was this philosophy? It is a 
  fact that Tagore was Nobel Prize winning world famous and great poet, but did 
  he leave behind any great philosophy as a great man? It is also a fact that 
  being enchanted by the appeal of his songs and poems, some people regard him 
  almost like a deity, but was he really worthy of regarded to as such? The life 
  of Tagore bears testimony to the opposite. Tagore portrayed many Upens with 
  heart-rending narratives, but like his father &amp; grandfather he was basically 
  greedy and cruel oppressor of poor subjects. <b><font color="#800080">Although 
  universal love was the main theme of his poetry, he himself was guided by 
  pride and discrimination. Although he used to wear, like the ancient priests, 
  Upanishadic outfit and his physical stature resembled to those of priests, he 
  was, in heart and mind, an obedient worshipper of the Royal British rulers.</font></b> 
  How can a person of this self-serving and self-contradicting and cunning 
  double-dealing nature be our role model?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <font color="#800080"><b>Very few people know the true colour of Tagore. And 
  one of them who knew him very well as his widowed sister. Their father 
  Debendranath Tagore allocated a portion of the income from Zamindari to pay 
  for the monthly allowance for his widowed daughter. But Tagore stopped this 
  allowance after the death of their father by destroying the legal documents.</b></font> 
  Believe it or not, Tagore also burnt all Will papers (compiled and signed by 
  their grandfather) with the noble motive of depriving all shareholders 
  mentioned in the Will.&quot; [Prof Abu Zafar, 'Rabindra Bibh'bram', Daily Inqilab, 
  July 7, 2000].<br>

  before in the history of Bengal, a famous Bengali, pure Bengali Hindu better 
  than Tagore was ever born</b></font>.&quot; Tagore handed down his verdict like 
  this way, &quot;<font color="#800080"><b>British rule is all about God's rule. To 
  rebel against it is sin.</b></font>&quot; He said, &quot;Although Muslims are followers 
  of Islam, they are Hindu in race; They are basically 'Hindu-Muslim'.&quot; [Dr 
  Badiuzzaman, Bidrohi Rabindranath Paschim'er Shimantey, 2000].<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Patriotic songs like 'Amar Sonar Bangla', 'Banglar Maati Banglar Jol/ Banglar 
  Baiyu Banglar Ful' etc remind us the name of Tagore right away. However, these 
  songs might give wrong notion about Tagore's love for Bengal, Bengali or 
  Bengalee.<br>

  &quot;<b><font color="#800080">Though a Brahmin, Tagore married 11-year old

  the ages of 15.5, 12 and 14 years, respectively. </font></b>Since his 
  blossoming youth, his life revolved around Brahmo society, worshipping in 
  temple, and Tatyabodhini magazine. Although Tagore, throughout his entire 
  life, was devoted to the welfare of Brahmo society, and religious duties,

  In his works, Tagore glorified (or at least mentioned their names) ancient 
  Bharat, the era of Upanishad, nature of Tapobon, era of Kalidas ('Aami jodi 
  jonmo nitam Kalidas'er kaley' i.e. I wish I were born in the era of Kalidas),

  <font size="2">It is surprising to note that Tagore could hardly find any

  of Tagore! <b><font color="#800080">What was so Bengalee about Tagore other 
  than the fact that he wrote and speak in Bengali. </font></b>Comments of 
  Probodh Sen are worth-mentioning here, &quot;The erstwhile British govt split 
  Bengal into two parts on October 16, 1905 (Aswin 30, 1312). At that time, 
  Bengal patriotism found its best expression thru' the songs of Tagore; Songs 
  like 'Ebar Tor Mora Gangey Baan Esheychhey', 'Jodi Tor Daak Shuney Keu Naa 
  Aashey', 'Amar Sonar Bangla Aami Tomay Bhalobashi', etc were composed around 
  that time. <font color="#800080"><b>Previously composed song 'O Amar Desh'er 
  Maati Tomar Porey Thetai Maatha' was published in the Aswin issue of 
  Bangodarshan magazine. We need to keep in mind that it was the month of Aswin 
  -- the month of matribondana. This song was the lucid and natural expression 
  of Bankim's Bandematram song. As such considered from various angles, this 
  song can be considered Rabindric version of Bankim's Bandeymatram song.</b></font>&quot; 
  [Probodhchandra Sen, Bankim-Rabindra Dristitey Banglar Otit, p.219]<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  A devout Rabindra researcher Probodhchandra Sen had this to say about Tagore, 
  &quot;... <font color="#800080"><b>Like Bankimchandra, Rabindranath was not solely 
  devoted to the cause of Bengal rather to that of Mother India. Actually, he 
  never showed distinct respect towards Bengali culture and tradition.</b></font> 
  For Bangladesh, he left behind the proposition of assimilation with India. ... 
  There is hardly any influence of the history of Bengal in the works of Tagore.&quot;

  Annadashankar Roy commented about Tagore, &quot;<font color="#800080"><b>He is like 
  a river since his talent did not flourish fully in the arena of ancient 
  Sangskrit literature, Antolok literature or Bengali literature. Justice would 
  be meted out to him only if we give him a place beside Indian poets like 
  Balmiki or Kalidas rather than considering him a Bengalee poet.</b></font> ... 
  He lost his direction after being awarded Nobel Prize, and became a burden to 
  the world by neglecting the flourishment of his full poetic potential.&quot; [From 
  a letter written to poet Vishnu Dey by Annadashankar Roy on July 13, 1947

  <font size="2">&quot;However, he did not harbour the same feeling towards the 
  British. Rather he nurtured profound love, confidence and respect for them. 
  The reason behind his indifference towards politics of self-governance in the 
  country, non-chalance about the establishement of independence movement was 
  this love for the British. Novels like 'Ghorey-Bairey', 'Char Odday' and some 
  essays are worth recalling in this respect. He did not have propensity to 
  establish self-governance for India. He was expectant of good governance by 
  the British. <font color="#800080"><b>Essays like 'Rajkutumbo', 'Ghushoghushi', 
  'Swadeshi Samaj' etc are to be recalled here. It is to be kept in mind that 
  brutal killing at Jaliwanwalabagh did not move him an inch to renounce his 
  Knighthood; it took 46 days for him to come to that decision due to some 
  internal pressure. The 40-year old poet composed 'Matrishokashchash' to mourn 
  the death of Queen Victoria; Knighthood delighted him to his heart's content, 
  and in 1911 the grateful poet composed, on behalf of the Hindus, the hymn 'Jonogon 
  Mon Odhinayok' to extol King George V for repealing the Bengal Partition Act.</b></font>&quot;

  <font color="#800080"><b>As the rebels found Tagore to be against the

  Plagiarism:</span></font></strong></u><small><br>
  <br>
  <font size="2">Pratap Narayan Biswas, a Calcatian author-resembler, wrote 
  several essays accusing Tagore of plagiarism. One of them 'Jogajog: 
  Goldsworthy &amp; Rabindranath' was published in the first issue of 'Onustap' [now 
  in its 23rd year of publication] magazine. Here is one comment about Tagore, &quot;<b><font color="#800080">Sir 
  Rabindranath Tagore is not a poet who brings news from the East, but one who 
  returns to us what we have already lent.</font></b>&quot; [Edward Shanks, 'Sir 
  Rabindranath Tagore', The Queen (London), 1921].<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Before starting to write his Jogajog novel, Tagore, in Chaitra 12, 1333 (Chithipatra 
  5) said, 'An attempt is underway to bring out a new magazine by the name of 'Bichitra' 
  by some enterprising and rich quarter. I have fallen prey to their trap owing 
  to both my want of money and greed. You won't be able to figure out how 
  destitute I have become.' [See also Probhatkumar Mukharjee, Rabindra Jiboni, 
  vol 3, 1359, p.249].<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  To give some background behind his writing of Gora novel, Prabhatkumar said, 
  'The urge to write stories was external. Tagore's youngest daughter was to be 
  married off in Jaistha, 1314. There was acute want of money. Ramananda 
  Chatterjee requested Tagore to write a short story for The Probashi magazine 
  and sent some money in advance. The poet wrote and sent two short stories. 
  'Master Moshoy' and 'Galpo' which were published in two installments of The 
  Probashi (Asar &amp; Sravan). But the poet thought that he was not adequately 
  paid. As such he started to write Gora novel. During the writing of Gora, 
  Tagore was not only inflicted with financial hardship, he succumbed to various 
  physical and psychological hardship arising from illness of his horse and 
  daughter Meera, and deaths of friend Srishchandra Majumdar, son-in-law 
  Satyendranath and son Shomindranath. Despite this hardship, he managed to send 
  installments of Gora to the office of The Probashi spanning a period of 32 
  months.<font color="#800080"><b> The only reason behind this was that he was 
  able to borrow the main theme, characters, incidents, narrative details and 
  dialogue from less known novel 'Felix Holt The Radical'. Two other books that 
  were consulted to complete the Gora novel were The Vicar of Wakefield by 
  Oliver Goldsmith and Father &amp; Sons by Tugerniev (sp?). Some of his famous 
  short stories (such as Sampat'ti, Swamorpon, Nishithey, Khudhitoo Pashan, 
  Guptodhon) were written borrowing themes, plots, characters, background, 
  descriptions from foreign short stories</b></font>.<br>
