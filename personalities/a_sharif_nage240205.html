				weekly discussions on issues ranging from the ideal way of child 
				rearing to modern theories of literature and philosophy through 
				a rational outlook. Dr. Sharif donated his corneas to two blind 
				men - Hafez Khairul Alam Khokan from Madaripur and Sakir Hossain

				College authorities for dissection and study by the students.

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A most misunderstood personality in 
	our times was Dr. Ahmed Sharif. He was a towering scholar, researcher of 
	Bengali literature and a forerunner of free thought movements in Bangladesh. 
	A man with a deep sense of dignity, a true nonconformist and an atheist, a 
	former Chairman and Professor of the Bengali Department, University of 
	Dhaka, Sharif died on February 24, 1999. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Ahmed Sharif who came from Patiya, Chittagong, did his Masters and 
	Ph.D. degrees in Bengali literature from the University of Dhaka, in the 
	years 1944 and 1967 respectively. From 1945 to 1949, he taught at Laksham 
	Nawab Faizunnessa College and later on at Feni College. From July 1949 to 
	December 1950 he worked as Program Assistant at the Dhaka Centre of Radio 
	Pakistan. Finally, on December 18, 1950, he joined as Research Assistant in 
	the Bengali Department, University of Dhaka and retired as Chairman and 
	Professor in 1983. During his teaching life in the university he was elected 
	a member of the Senate, Syndicate, President of the Teachers Association and 
	the University Teachers Club. Even today, Dr. Sharif has the distinction of 
	being the only person to be elected Dean of the Faculty of Arts for three 
	consecutive terms. After his retirement from Dhaka University, he was 
	offered the position of the first Kazi Nazrul Islam Professor at the 
	University of Chittagong, where he served for two years from 1984 to 1986.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahmed Sharif was the recipient of many honours and awards for his 
	outstanding contributions in the field of medieval Bengali literature and 
	contemporary socio-cultural-political essays. In his lifetime, he was the 
	lone authority on ancient and medieval Bengali literature, the discussions 
	of which he enriched with many original contributions. He was the author of 
	more than a hundred research publications in the form of books on history, 
	philosophy, socio-cultural and contemporary political issues. He edited with 
	long introductions 46 manuscripts of ancient and medieval Bengali literature 
	and a number of others were in joint collaboration. Sub-continental scholars 
	believe that the two volumes of his Bangalee O Bangla Shahitya (Men and 
	Literature of Bengal), published between 1978 and 1983, are masterpieces. It 
	may be mentioned here that during his lifetime he wrote more than 34611 
	pages in total and all his handwritten pages stand at 13844 pages in print. 
	Never did he care for appreciation or publicity for his scholarly works. 
	During his lifetime a bulk of sycophants and a large section of the 
	so-called liberal democrats and secular intellectuals of the country 
	continuously denied his scholarly contribution and suppressed his free 
	thoughts. Even after his death they are doing the same, but no one has ever 
	questioned his intellectual honesty.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many believe that one of Sharif's major achievements was that, 
	he unlike many of his contemporary scholars and academicians, had been able 
	to draw the hatred and enmity of reactionary forces by a bold expression of 
	his own views. The late scholar was universally regarded for his ability to 
	say &quot;no&quot; to various material temptations; his dignity and self respect never 
	permitted him to be submissive to power. Among his Dhaka University 
	colleagues he was just an impractical man, a cynic seized with radical ideas 
	who was never &quot;clever&quot; enough to work for his own mundane interests as he 
	never took any undue advantage of his scholarship position and influence to 
	become wealthy, famous and powerful. The educated but ignorant people of 
	Bangladesh are not aware of this misunderstood and controversial person who 
	played a vital role in provoking our thoughts in order to create a sense of 
	awareness in us. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following paper clippings on different national issues hint at his 
	sense of responsibility and love for the people.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o The Bengali Department of Dhaka University arranged a meeting on the 
	occasion of Language Day. The meeting was presided over by Dr. Ahmed Sharif, 
	where a unanimous decision was taken against the Education Commission 
	proposal for introduction and implementation of Roman alphabets in the 
	Bengali language (Ittefaq: February 27, 1959).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o In 1963, the &quot;Interim East Bengal Government&quot; (in brief- Apurba Sangsad) 
	was formed after the successful movement against the education policy of the 
	then government and this &quot;Apurba Sangsad&quot; was the first organization which 
	propagated very secretly for &quot;Independent Bangladesh&quot;. Poet Sufia Kamal and 
	Abdul Aziz Bagmar were the President and Secretary respectively and Dr. 
	Ahmed Sharif was one of the Advisers.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Justice Muhammad Habibur Rahman has written that on 
	October 1, 1965, Dr. Ahmed Sharif prepared a secret document for Apurba 
	Sangsad (Asthaee Purba Bangla Sarker - Interim Government of East Bengal) 
	and the document was known as Manifesto of the Sangsad, the title was: 
	Ittihasher Dharay Bangalee (Historical Trends of Bengalees). Here he pointed 
	out the causes and ways for &quot;Independent Bangladesh&quot;; he also suggested ways 
	for socio-economic, political and cultural freedom for the Bengalees.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharif proposed the name of the then East Pakistan as &quot;Bangladesh&quot; and 
	chose Rabindranath Tagore's &quot;Sonar Bangla&quot; as the national anthem (Prothom 
	Alo, February 04, 2000. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"> <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Dr. Ahmed Sharif along with Dr. Kudrat-e-Khuda, Dr. Kazi Motahar 
	Hossain, Poet Sufia Kamal, Painter Zainul Abedin, Poet Sikandar Abu Zafar, 
	Prof. Munir Chowdhury, Poet Hasan Hafizur Rahman and others vehemently 
	opposed boycott of Tagore songs in the national media (Dainik Pakistan: 25, 
	1967)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Against the misuse of crores of rupees for the celebration of &quot;Decade 
	of Reforms&quot; of President Ayub Khan, Dr. Ahmed Sharif read out the main paper 
	and Novelist Hassan Azizul Haq, Journalist Safder Mir of the then West 
	Pakistan were the discussants at the poetry session of Afro-Asian Countries, 
	held at the Engineers Institute, Dhaka (Dainik Pakistan: November 30, 1968).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o A protest meeting and post-meeting procession were arranged at Bangla 
	Academy to protest the interference and attack by the Pakistan government on 
	the thoughts and rights of East Pakistan's writers, artists and cultural 
	activists. Dr. Ahmed Sharif, along with poet Sufia Kamal, painter Zainul 
	Abedin, poet Sikandar Abu Zafar, Prof. Munir Chowdhuiy, journalist Ranesh 
	Das Gupta and Shahidullah Kaisar spoke on the occasion. The meeting was 
	presided over by Dr. Muhammad Enamul Haq (Dainik Pakistan: January 15, 
	1969).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Dr. Ahmed Sharif along with Mr. Abul Hashim, Dr. Muhammed Enamul Haq, 
	poet Jashimuddin, poet Sufia Kamal, Prof. Muneir Chowdhury and Prof. 
	Mufazzal Haider Chowdhury, the seven top intellectuals of (the then) East 
	Pakistan demanded that the central government rename East Bengal as &quot;Bangla&quot; 
	because of the cancellation of one unit system in West Pakistan. In this 
	regard, Dr. Ahmed Sharif said, 'Our identity is &quot;Bangla&quot; and we are using &quot;Bangla&quot; 
	as our name in our poetry, literature, thoughts, speeches and every sphere 
	of life' (Writers Rights Protection Committee, 1969).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o The East Pakistan Student's League organised a seminar on &quot;Traditional 
	and Ever Lasting Bangla&quot; which was presided over by Mr. Abul Hashim of 
	Islamic Academy, while the discussants were Ataur Rahman Khan, Dr. Ahmed 
	Sharif, poet Jahanara Arzoo and Kazi Latifa Haq. Here Dr. Ahmed Sharif in 
	his speech publicly demanded that East Pakistan must be known as 
	&quot;Bangladesh&quot; (Daily Sangbad: December 25, 1969).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o At the meeting of the Writer Rights Preservation Committee, Dr. Abmed 
	Sharif in his presidential speech said that the curtain of conspiracy to 
	suppress the cultural activities (of East Bengal) has been opened because of 
	the different committees constituted by the Central Government for reviewing 
	arts and literature of East Bengal (Purbadesh: February 11, 1970)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Due to political turmoil and to overcome the situation, 128 teachers of 
	Dhaka University in a joint statement appealed to the President of Pakistan 
	to convene the National Assembly to save the people and country from a 
	possible severe civil war. The prominent signatories were: Prof. Abdur 
	Razzak, Dr. M.N. Huda, Dr. M. Innas li, Dr. Muzaffar Ahmed Chowdhury and Dr. 
	Mofizullah Kabir, Prof. Munir Chowdhury and Dr. Ahmed Sharif (Ittefaq: March 
	4, 1971).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o The Writers' Guild, which was established by the Central Government of 
	Pakistan for controlling the writers' thoughts of East Pakistan, and the 
	writers of this wing ultimately revolted against the government and came out 
	to the forefront and began to support the leadership of the liberation 
	movement. On March 5, 1971, all the cultural activists and intellectuals 
	went to &quot;Shahid Minar&quot; (Martyrs' Memorial) and took a solemn oath under the 
	leadership of Dr. Ahmed Sharif to the effect that &quot;even at the cost of our 
	life we will continue our struggle for the rights of East Bengal and through 
	our writings we will inspire the struggling people. For the success of the 
	movement, our writings will act as bayonets and bullets. Forgetting the 
	differences of the past, we will be united with the general masses and 
	proceed forward for the success of the struggle&quot; (Rafiqul Islam: Ekattorer 
	Osohojog Andolon-0-BuddUibira, 1982)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o For an independent and sovereign state, the Writers Action Committee 
	arranged a meeting under the presidentship of Dr. Abmed Sharif and the 
	meeting appealed to NAP leader Maulana Bhasani, Awami League leader Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman and other political leaders of East Pakistan to be united in 
	the greater interest of the people (Dainik Pakistan: March 15, 1971).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o At the press conference of the emergence of Mukti Juddha Chetona Bikash 
	Kendra (Centre for Awakening the War of Liberation Idea) Dr. Ahmed Sharif 
	said that without united effort no one can survive and due to the activities 
	of the Razakars (Pakistani collaborators) people are in danger. Therefore, 
	people should be united against the anti-liberation forces (Sangbad: August 
	24, 1985)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o On February 6, Muktadhara awarded Dr. Ahmed Sharif with Muktadhara 
	Literary Award and on this occasion Dr. Ahmed Sharif said there wouldn't be 
	any sin in the society if the number of atheist are increased, by which 
	tolerance will increase in the society. (Banglar Bani: February 7, 1989)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o As president of the Swadesh Chinta Sangha Dr. Ahmed Sharif condemned 
	the government for banning Dr. Taslima Nasreen's book &quot;Lajja&quot; (Shame). (Ittefaq: 
	October 14, 1993)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o On the occasion of the 21st death anniversary of Charu Majumder, a 
	seminar was organized on &quot;Naxalite Movement and Charu Majumder&quot;. Dr. Ahmed 
	Sharif commented that NGOs are not allowing our people to be self-reliant. 
	Economic emancipation won't come until we change the social system. (Bangla 
	Bazar Patrika: July 26, 1993)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his last days, Ahmed Sharif lived a secluded life to avoid the wrath 
	of a section of people who thought his views were too dangerous for the 
	establishment. During his lifetime, he was very much controversial and was a 
	misunderstood personality among his contemporaries in the country. He was 
	controversial because of his outspoken views against the establishment, 
	intellectuals and political leaders, and above all against a religious and 
	parochial outlook. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Tajul Islam Hashmi has written, &quot;. . . he could have become 
	vice-chancellor of several universities of this country, both during pre and 
	post Bangladesh periods.. He could have been an ambassador, an ever present 
	leader of delegations sent abroad by the governments of pre and post 
	Bangladesh to represent the culture and literature (and what not!) of the 
	region&quot;. Dr. Hashimi further wrote that Sharif could even have become 
	Chairman of the University Grants Commission or the Public Service 
	Commission or at least a National Professor for his knowledge and very rich 
	contributions to the field of Bengali language, literature and culture, both 
	as a dedicated researcher and active writer Alas! None of these positions 
	came to our Sharif Sir. Despite having such rare qualities he had to retire 
	in 1983. Neither the Bengali Department nor the university took any serious 
	initiative to have him continue in service. &quot;Possibly he knew the art of 
	antagonizing powerful people and different government agencies&quot; (Weekly 
	Holiday, March 3, 1999). Moreover, his strong sense of dignity and 
	self-respect did not permit him to be submissive to power. During the period 
	1986-96, three vice-chancellors were successively in office at Dhaka 
	University. They had been his close associates for decades. But during their 
	tenure in office, they deliberately denied him the honour of Emeritus 
	Professor, though his name as Emeritus Professor was on the agenda of the 
	University's Academic Council for several years but never was the issue 
	discussed or raised during his lifetime. (Abridged)</font></p>
