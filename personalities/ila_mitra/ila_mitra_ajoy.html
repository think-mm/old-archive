          (Calcutta) on Sunday, 13<sup>th</sup> October afternoon at PG
          hospital, Kolkata (Calcutta), West Bengal. It was learnt from ETV-Calcutta
          TV channel that following a severe heart attack some time back she had
          been under treatment in the PG hospital. She was 77. I remember her

          Nachol, a police station at that time of greater Rajshahi became the
          centre of peasant movement, known as Tebhaga Andolan in the district.
          Ila Mitra, an athlete of no mean calibre before she was married to a
          zaminder son of that locality, deeply got involved in the movement
          encouraged by his husband and ultimately became &#24;Rani Ma&#25;

          <p class="MsoNormal">Ila Sen, her maiden, was a daughter of a simple
          middle class government service holder. Their original home was at the
          village named Bagutia in the then Jenidah Subdivision of Jessore
          district. Her father, Nagendra Nath Sen was an accountant of AGB
          office, Calcutta when Ila was born on 18<sup>th</sup> October in 1925.
          She completed her education at Calcutta- studying at Bethun School
          &amp; College under Calcutta University. She passed BA with honours in
          Bengali literature in 1944. She finally obtained her MA degree in
          Bangla literature and Culture from Calcutta University as a private
          candidate in 1958 after long 13 years of passing BA. Why? That is part
          of her story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It might appear
          strange to many of us such a political personal was a champion athlete
          in her school and college days. In the decade of thirties she was a
          star woman in the world of sports in Bengal. She was junior champion
          athlete in Bengal Presidency from 1935 &#19; 1938. She was a good
          basketball player too. She was selected to represent India in
          athletics in Olympic games scheduled to be held in 1940 in Japan,
          which however could not be held because of World War II. In 1944, she
          got married with Ramendra Nath Mitra, son of a Zemindar family of
          Ramchandrapur, then under Maldah district of British Bengal adjacent
          to present district of Nawabganj in Bangladesh. Ramendra however not
          only a son of a Zemindar family, but himself an organizer of the
          communist movement in Maldah. He was a district president of Peasant
          Association.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Through marriage she
          first became aware of the peasant movement in northern region of
          undivided Bengal. But even before her marriage she got involved with
          politics of left through Students Federation, a left oriented
          students&#25; organization and Women Self Defense Association (<i>Mahila
          Atama Raksha Samity</i>). She became very much active in communist
          movement in early forties, as a result of which she got the membership
          of Communist Party of India (CPI) at the age of only 18 years. After
          marriage she moved to Ramchandrapur as a newly married bride of a
          conservative traditional Hindu family. The couple had their only son
          born in 1948, while Ila Mitra was organizing peasant movement in the
          locality of Nachol under the directives of CPI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

          <h2><font size="3">Ila Mitra came to prominence during 1948, just
          after partition of Bengal in 1947 for her revolutionary leadership to
          peasant movement, popularly known as &#24;<span style="COLOR: red">Tebhaga
          Andolan</span>&#25;, as we mentioned earlier.</font></h2>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Bengali word
          &#24;Tebhaga&#25; means division in three parts. The objective of the
          movement among the peasant class was that a cultivating peasant must
          get two-third share of the total yield divided into three and rest one
          third would go to the owner of the land. The necessary political
          leadership to the movement came from the Bengal Peasant Association, a
          front organization of the peasants and landless agriculture laborer of
          CPI. The movement took serious turn and reached its peak in 1946. It
          became very popular in north Bengal particularly in the districts of
          Jalpaiguri, Dinajpur, Maldah, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Bogra and adjacent
          part of Pabna.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In order to
          understand tebhaga movement we have to understand the land
          distribution system in that area. At the top of the land owning system
          was the class of zeminders who got lease of lands through permanent
          settlement of the British law. These zemindars have no direct link
          with the cultivation of lands owned by them. The link between the
          zemindars and the British government was that zemindars would pay a
          yearly tax fixed by the government depending on quantity and quality
          of the lands owned by the zemindars. How these lands would be
          cultivated, developed and what income would be generated was left to
          the zemindars. At the next bottom of etalon was the class jotdars to
          whom the zemindars distributed lands through a system called &#24;Pattani&#25;.
          The pattani was achieved through negotiation on the basis of fixed
          taxes to be renewed and reviewed time to time. The jotdars class was
          the real people directly connected with lands and cultivation.
          Although outside the &#24;jotdari system&#25; there were many land
          owning individuals, small and big who directly pay their land taxes to
          the zemindars through the &#24;Nayebi &#19; Tahsildari&#25; system of
          the zemindars, the jotdars in north Bengal used own vast lands to the
          tune of hundreds and thousands of acres and they were the real class
          of people whose fortune and fate were directly land linked. Therefore
          these people who had to look after cultivation and development of
          lands so far its yield were concerned. Thus the fate of the farmers
          were linked intricately with jotdari system. Now, jotdars used two
          system of cultivation:</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">(i). employ
          agricultural laborers to cultivate lands under the direct supervision
          of the jotdar himself.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">(ii). give lease of
          lands to individual farmers, a small land owning class of people who
          directly cultivate lands of their own or taken lease from a jotdar for
          a particular period of time which depended on the sweet will of the
          jotdar. The terms of conditions of such arrangement were: All
          investing cost of cultivation of leased land had to be borne by the
          farmer; <span style="COLOR: red">the total yield of corps must be
          shared equally between the cultivator and the owner of the land i.e.
          jotdar.</span> This system of cultivation of land was commonly known
          as &#24;Adhiary Pratha&#25; (half-half system), mostly prevalent in
          north Bengal. This class of cultivating farmers was known as &#24;Adhiar&#25;
          (half sharer). Through this mechanism, just because a jotdar owned a
          piece of land he used to derive benefit without investing any thing in
          the land. More over he used to exploit the labor of a cultivator in
          various form- the poor man becoming almost a slave of the landowner.
          There was always a constant threat over his head that if he did not
          listen to the jotdar he would take away the land and he would have to
          starve. This was surely a system of exploitation to extreme limit.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Thus
          zemindari-jotdari system used to be a instrument of exploitation that
          had been agitating the people belonging to small peasant class. Their
          grievances grew as the economic situation in the country getting worse
          in the post war period that immediately followed a terrible famine
          (1942) throughout Bengal, at that time being governed by Muslim league
          with Mr. Shaheed Surwardy as chief minister. The economic situation,
          political unrest, and unbearable social conditions of the peasants led
          to the movement later known as Tebhaga Andolan. The communist leaders
          and Krishak samity leaders took full advantage of the unrest
          prevailing among the poor peasants and land less agricultural
          laborers.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The movement sparked
          off in an area under Ps Chirirbandar in the district of Dinajpur. The
          area had a local communist leader, Shri Rupnarayan Roy, himself a
          small land owning farmer &amp; local organizer of Krishak Samity,
          first and only MLA (member of the legislative assembly) of Bengal
          assembly elected from CPI ticket in 1946 election. He, together with
          other peasant leaders of the locality led a movement in and around his
          locality &amp; organized the peasants mostly Hindus belonging to
          Kshatriya caste &amp; some Muslim cultivators in a grand assembly on
          the day when jotdars men would come to collect 50% share of the corps.
          The assembled farmers refused to give 50% , instead they offered 33 %
          out of total yield. A serious fight flared up between the jotdars&#25;
          armed men and the adamant peasants resulting several injuries to both
          parties. Police came to the rescue of the jotards&#25; men and in
          doing so a peasant was killed in police fire. The event took serious
          turn; local villagers came on the side of the peasants and police had
          to retreat. But couple of days later reinforced police force set a
          reign of terrors in village after village in Chirirbandar police
          station- the leaders were haunted out, even common villagers including
          women were not spared from their physical torture and repressive
          action. Common methodology used by the police for physical torture
          were divestiture of clothe of womenfolk followed by beating with
          lathes and for men putting the man in between two hard bamboos and the
          sliding those bamboos over the body from feet to head apart from
          kicking with boots and charging with lathes and iron rods. Hundreds of
          villagers were arrested.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This was the ignition
          that sparked the tebhaga movement and spread throughout north Bengal
          and in some parts of southwest Bengal including Jessore, Khulna and 24
          Parganas within a year. I myself saw, as a boy of class vi in those
          days, hundreds and thousands of peasants, men and women from different
          villages were being arrested and brought to the Kotwali Police station
          in Dinajpur district town, not far from our residence. They were
          harassed, tortured and physically beaten. My father got involved in
          the movement, not as communist or peasant leader, but as a lawyer
          &amp; as a humanist. He tried his best with others to defend the cases
          of tebhaga accused poor people and used to move numbers of bail
          petitions every day. I saw him how he spent his hectic days at that
          time.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The political change
          because of partition of Bengal in 1947 brought the end of Tebhaga
          Andolan, at least its intensity dwindled down in northern districts
          those were included in East Pakistan. The new Muslim League government
          subdued the movement with stern hand. The veteran communist leaders
          mostly belonging to Hindu community and activists of the movement,
          being termed as enemies of the baby state Pakistan, were put behind
          the bar or repulsed out of the country.</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: black">In
          1946 Ila Mitra was just a housewife in a conservative Hindu zemindar
          family at Ramchandrapur. But slowly, together with her husband, she
          was taking part in the peasant movement of the locality. Ramen Mitra
          wanted her wife to take part in communist movement as she did in the
          past as a student in Calcutta. Encouraged by her husband Ila Mitra
          gradually came out of the family boundary. When riot broke out in
          Calcutta, Bihar and some parts of East Bengal, Ila Mitra came down to
          Noakhali under the directives of CPI, extensively toured affected
          areas together with Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu-Muslim leaders and
          took part in rehabilitation work among the distressed people. This was
          the first time, being a house of a conservative Hindu family, she came

          Maldah fell within the territory of East Bengal, then a province of
          Pakistan. The family, particularly at the insistence of mother in law
          of Ila Mitra decided to stay back in Pakistan. The geographical area
          of the Zemindari was included in the district of greater Rajshahi. The
          partition created an unsteady state in the minds of the local people
          mostly inhabited by Hindus and so called Adibasis, the Saontal
          community. The decision of Zemindar family to stay back created a

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On the day of 14<sup>th</sup>
          August, 1947 in an assembly of villagers in Ramchandrapur, Ramen Mitra,
          the CPI local leader hoisted the Pakistani flag. The event acted as a
          reassuring antidote in the mind of the minority community. At the
          initiative of local peasant leader Altaf Hosain a school was
          established at the village Krishna-Govindapur, about five minutes walk
          from residence of Zemindar family. The villagers demanded that to
          educate their sons and daughters, the Badhumata i.e. Ila Mitra must
          become teacher of the school to which Ila Mitra agreed. The school
          started with 3 students, which rose to 55 within a year. She took it
          as a challenge and dedicated her life in removing illiteracy from the
          village- she gradually, centering the school, build up a movement of
          &#24;education for all&#25;. This gave her a unique opportunity to mix
          with peasants and their problems, their aspiration and needs. She
          became their &#24;Rani Ma&#25;. As I said locality is a non-Muslim
          dominated area of which Adibashis form an important component in the
          local population. The Adibashis belonged to cultivating class having
          no land of their own &#19; most of them are adhiars. Apart from
          Adibashis other Hindu cultivators were from Kshatriya, Bhuindas &amp;
          Kaibartas castes.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">After partition of
          Bengal in 1947, five police stations of Maldah district came under
          Rajshahi district in Pakistan. These five police stations were
          Nababganj, Bholahat, Shibganj, Nachol and Gomostapur.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The Saontals of these areas had the great tradition of fighting
          against Britishers for their independent homeland under the leadership
          of Jitu Sardar. The Nachol Bidroha (Nachol rebellion) of 1950 against
          the Pakistanis was the legacy of that tradition.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Because of stern
          attitude and repression on the communist party in Pakistan, the party
          leadership decided to work in East Pakistan from within under ground-
          all the leaders, including Ila Mitra,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>were asked to go underground. This was in 1948- Ila Mitra was
          then carrying. She silently crossed over to Calcutta where she gave

          station now in Nawabganj district. It is an inaccessible area even for
          today. It is about 35 km from Rajshahi town. It is better to approach
          Nachol from Rajshahi via Tanore ( about 15 km north from Rajshahi)

          Tanore directly westward.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The local peasant
          leaders with the help of the under ground communist and Kishan Samity
          leaders worked relentless preparing the ground of tebhaga movement in
          those locality for two years from 1948-1950. In popularizing the
          movement among the peasants, apart from Ila Mitra and Ramen Mitra, the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>organizing leadership on the surface were provided by the local
          leaders those included among others were: Sibu Koramudi, a Saontal
          communist leader in the district of Rajshahi, Matla Majhi, Tutu
          Hembram, Chitor Majhi, Sagaram Majhi, Sukra Madang, Chutar Majhi,
          Sukhbilas Barman, Bhagirath Karmakar etc. It may be remembered that at
          this time when Tebhaga Andolan was getting momentum under the fiery
          leadership of Ila Mitra the movement in other districts of East Bengal
          had been crushed by the Muslim league government.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In the area of Nachol
          of which Chandipur, Krishnapur, Kendua, Ghamura, Shibnagar, Manda,
          Golappara, Mallikpur, Kalupur, and Mahipur were the most sensitive
          area of the movement the jotdars used to get two-third share and
          one-third went to the cultivator instead of half-half as in other
          districts of north Bengal. For husking rice from paddy the laborers
          used to get 3 Aras (katha/dhama) only out of 20 Aras. Ila made her
          head quarter of the movement in the village of Chandipur at the house
          of veteran Saontal communist leader Matla Majhi.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The objective of the
          movement was straightened out in very simple terms:</p>
          <ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
            <li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo14; tab-stops: list .5in">two-third
              share will be for the cultivator and one-third will be for the
              jotdar, out of the total yield.
            <li class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo14; tab-stops: list .5in">for
              rice husking from paddy, out of 20 Aras of husked rice, the
              laborer would get<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>seven
              Aras and the owner would get rest i.e. 13 Aras.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In local dialect the
          slogan was raised : &#24; Sat Ari jin o Fasaler tebhaga&#25; ( for
          husking seven Ara and three share for cultivation ). In order to make
          the demand popular Ila Mitra extensively toured village after village,
          met the Khet majurs, common cultivators, small farmers and publicly
          addressed the peasant meetings in the remote corners of the villages
          giving bluff to the police administration. In this way she earned the
          title &#24;Rani Ma&#25;. A song was composed by village poet :</p>

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Thus a ground was
          ripe for launching the final phase of the movement to get their demand
          materialized. The leaders also organized a defense force from among
          the revolutionary peasants in which Hindus, Muslims and Saontals took
          part, although Saontal community provided the main element of force.
          The force was equipped with bow with arrow, spears, lathe and home
          made different types of choppers with haft etc... The force was
          trained how to repulse the attacking police force and to make defence
          formidable. The force was also taught how to retreat safely. Another
          popular slogan among the peasants was</p>

          </o:p>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The movement took
          violent form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">As the movement
          gained momentum leaders thought that that time was ripe to give effect
          of the tebhaga doctrine. The implementation of the principle began
          with Mitra zemindar family of Ramchandrapur. It was not an easy task.
          By persuasion and negotiation by the leaders including Mitra couple
          the family accepted tebhaga doctrine of distribution of yield. This
          happened in autumn of 1949 at the time of major harvesting season. The
          zemindar family had over 500 bighas of corps yielding lands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Encouraged by the initial success the leaders imposed the
          principle on other zemindars and jotdars one by one sometimes through
          persuasion, some times using threat and sometimes using force. By 1950
          almost all landowners in and around Nachol were forced to accept the
          &#24;Sat Ari &amp; Tebhaga doctrine&#25;.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The method, the
          peasant leaders adopted for implementing the doctrine was a very
          simple but effective one. After harvesting the corps of particular
          field the owner of the land was invited to be present on the day in
          presence of the leaders of the movement, common villagers and the
          cultivator. In his presence or absence of the land owner total corps
          of the field was divided in three parts- keeping two-third for the
          cultivator, rest one-third was sent to the owner carried by cow driven
          cart. The landowners were forced to accept the distribution.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">But to the eye of the
          administration and the landowners this was looked upon as illegal and
          &#24;looting of yields&#25; by force. In most cases the process of
          implementation had been smooth except in one or two cases force had to
          be employed. One such case was the zemindars of Mahipur who refused to
          yield to the pressure of the leaders and used firearms to repulse the
          assembled peasants and leaders. But ultimately the zemindar had
          accepted the demand.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">But the government
          could not sit idle particularly when the landowners, jotdars, and
          zemindars both collectively and individually appealed to the
          administration to end this &#24;terrorism&#25; of the peasants. The
          zemindars and jotdars now with help of the police force started to
          take revenge. The police let loose reign of terror and oppression
          village after village to subdue the movement. Many peasant activists
          and innocent people were tortured and taken to police custody. The
          police also started combing operation after surrounding a locality.
          The life of underground leaders gradually became unbearable and
          unsafe. The movement reached its peak. A showdown became evident.</p>
          <h4>Date line January 5, 1950</h4>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On 5<sup>th</sup>
          January, 1950 a group of constables led by an officer in charge (OC)
          of Nachol Ps arrived in village Chandipur, the nerve centre of the
          movement. They arrested two activists and started physical torture to
          extract information of tebhaga movement &amp; its leaders. Some
          villagers, as per planed method of sending message of danger raised a
          red flag on top of a long bamboo and started beating tom-tom (madal),
          a kind of drums usually played by Saontal community. Hearing the
          message of danger thousands of villagers assembled at Chandipur
          equipped with native weapons described earlier. The small police force
          was gheraoed and 5 constables with the OC got killed as a result of
          fighting as police opened fire to disperse the armed mob. This created
          panic at Nachol police station and among other police force deployed
          at different places under Nachol Ps. The precarious position of the
          police was signaled to higher authority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">After two days i.e.
          on 7<sup>th</sup> January about 2000 soldiers arrive at Amnura Railway
          station. The army surrounded all villages of Nachol,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>set fire 12 villages, ransacked houses after houses and killed
          many villagers as they moved in towards Chandipur village.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The army was supported by armed police and ansars. They moved
          in door to door in search of the wanted leaders, as usual looted and
          set fire on the houses, tortured the male members of each and every
          family of the village, women were sexually violated, even children
          were not shown any mercy.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">An unequal fighting
          started- on the one side thousands of Saontals-Hindus and Muslim
          peasants comprising the defence force of tebhaga and on other side
          were army, police and ansars armed with modern fire arms. The defense
          force could not resist any more- they had to give in. Hundreds of
          saontals members were killed. Bow &amp; arrow could not be a match to
          facing against sophisticated guns. Group by group they retreated and
          finally crossed over to India. Villagers were forced to leave the
          country to escape inhuman repression at the hands of law enforcing
          agencies.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">As the villagers
          leaving the locality, underground leaders had no shelter- they were
          exposed for arrest. Comrade in arm Matla Majhi asked Ila Mitra to
          accompany his team for safe place, which she declined as Matla himself
          was not in a good condition to move. The peasant comrades suggested to
          their Rani Ma that they would safely take her to other side of the
          border under cover of rice paddy in a cow-driven cart. But Ila Mitra
          did not agree till all her comrades in arm and volunteers of her
          defence force could move to relatively safer zones from Nachol.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Other tebhaga leaders
          of Nachol including Azahar Hosain, Animesh Lahiri and Chitta
          Chkraborty were arrested while trying to esacpe from the locality on 8<sup>th</sup>
          January&#25; 50. In the process of escaping and taking shelter in
          safer places Mitra couple got separated from each other in two groups.
          The group led by Ramen Mitra could safely cross the border.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The other group with
          Ila Mitra and Brindaban Saha and hundreds of Saontal followers of the
          Rani Ma, dressed in Saontal dresses left the last village of Nachol
          Police station on 7<sup>th</sup> January towards Indian border
          westward. They took shelter near Rohanpur Railway station for rest.
          But unfortunately, even though she was dresses as Saontal woman and
          were found to speak in Saontali dialect she was detected as non
          Saontal by the detective police moving around the assembled Saontal
          people. The police immediately arrested her with all her companions.
          Hundreds of them were brought to Nachol police station. There began
          the police torture of inhuman level. The police repeatedly asked the
          tortured peasants to admit that it was Ila Mitra who led the fight on
          that day and she ordered to kill five policeman and the OC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>But none confessed- one comrade succumbed to death because of
          police repression. Several others also died due to police torture at
          Nachol PS. According to rough estimation the number lies anything
          between 50 &#19; 100.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Then came the horror
          of torture on Ila Mitra herself. She was exposed to various types of
          physical torture one can think off committed on her fragile delicate
          body by police for 3-4 days at Nachol PS. Her fault were- she was
          woman, she was Hindu, she was communist and above all she led the
          tebhaga rebellion with arms. She was a dangerous element. She survived
          this inhuman torture probably because once she was an athlete and used
          to hard life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">After 4 days of
          torture at Nachol she was brought to Nawabganj police station in a
          pathetic condition with high fever and smeared with blood. This story
          of hers would be the theme of Part II of the series.</p>
