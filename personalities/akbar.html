<p>Akbar, &quot;The Great&quot; - A Tyrannical Monarch</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>History of India has witnessed innumerable invasions by hoards of armed 
marauders coming in from the west, perhaps attracted to the riches and wealth 
India then possessed. Apart from looting of wealth and destruction of property, 
the 'aliens' who remained, who committed grave atrocities against the local 
populace, and themselves, wallowing in immoral and unethical behaviour; except 
for one, it is said, Akbar.</p>
<p>Akbar, the third generation Moghal emperor who lived from 1542-1605 A.D, has 
been extolled as the greatest of all Moghals, righteous in deed and noble in 
character. He is praised to be the only and truly secular Emperor of the times, 
very caring and protective of his subjects. However, assessment and analysis of 
contemporary notings expose this unjustified edification of Akbar and provides a 
remarkably different picture of Akbar's personality.</p>
<p>The following is not a comprehensive report on Akbar's reign, but an attempt 
to provide a summary to the reader, on the real nature of Akbar based on 
contemporary records. It is hoped that the reader will make a judgement on 
Akbar's &quot;greatness&quot; based on the information provided below.</p>
<p>Akbar's Ancestors</p>
<p>Akbar's ancestors were barbarous and vicious, and so were his descendants 
like Aurangzeb and others' down the line. Akbar was born and brought up in a 
illiterate and foul atmosphere characterized by excessive drinking, womanizing 
and drug addiction. Vincent Smith in &quot;Akbar - The Great Mogul&quot; (p.294) writes, &quot; 
Intemperance was the besetting sin of the Timuroid royal family, as it was of 
many other muslim ruling houses. Babur (was) an elegant toper ... Humayun made 
himself stupid with opium ... Akbar permitted himself the practices of both 
vices .. Akbar's two sons died in early manhood from chronic alcoholism, and 
their elder brother was saved from the same fate by a strong constitution, and 
not by virtue.&quot; With such an atmosphere to nourish Akbar's thoughts, it is 
rather unsual for Akbar to become &quot;divine incarnate&quot;!</p>
<p>Describing the demoniac pleasure which Babur used to derive by raising towers 
of heads of people he used to slaughter, Col. Tod writes that after defeating 
Rana Sanga at Fatehpur Sikri &quot;triumphal pyriamids were raised of the heads of 
the slain, and on a hillock which overlooked the field of the battle, a tower of 
skulls was erected and the conquerer Babur assumed the title of Ghazi.&quot; (p.246). 
Akbar seems to have preserved this &quot;great&quot; legacy of erecting minarets as is 
obvious from the accounts of battles he fought.</p>
<p>Humayun, the son of Babar, was even more degenerate and cruel than his 
father. After repeated battles, Humayum captured his elder brother Kamran and 
subjected the latter to brutal torture. A detailed account is left by Humayun's 
servant Jauhar and is quoted by Smith (p.20), which says, &quot; .. (Humayun) had 
little concerns for his brother's sufferings .. One of the men was sitting on 
Kamran's knees. He was pulled out of the tent and a lancet was thrust into his 
eyes .. Some lemon juice and salt was put into his eyes .. After sometime he was 
put on horseback.&quot; One can imagine the cruelty and torture that Humayun was 
capable of inflicting on others when he subjected to his own brother to such 
atrocities. Humayun was also a slave to opium habit, engaged in excessive 
alcohol consumption and a lecherous degenarate when it came to women (Shelat, 
p.27). He is also known to have married a 14 year old Hamida Begum by force. The 
cruelties perpetrated by of Akbar's descendants (Jehangir, Shahjahan, Aurangzeb, 
etc.) are not entirely different from those of his ancestors. Having brought up 
in the company and under the guidance of a lineage of drug addicts, drunkards 
and sadists, it is rather anamalous that Akbar held such a gentle and noble 
character. Even assuming that he fancied nobility, it is amazing that Akbar let 
his comtemporaries and Generals, like Peer Mohammad, loot and rape the helpless 
citizenry that he was ruling! It would however be interesting to observe the 
incidents in Akbar's reign and evaluate his character.</p>
<p>Akbar's (Immoral) Character and Nature</p>
<p>Akbar possessed a inordinate lust for women, just like his ancestors and 
predecessors. One of Akbar's motives during his wars of aggression against 
various rulers was to appropriate their women, daughters and sisters. The Rajput 
women of Chittor prefered &quot;Jauhar&quot; (immolation) than to be captured and 
disrespectfully treated as servants and prostitutes in Akbar's harem. On his 
licentous relations with women, Smith refers to a contemporary Jesuits testimony 
(p.81) thus, &quot;... Akbar habitually drank hard. The good father had boldly dared 
to reprove the emperor sharply for his licentous relations with women. Akbar 
instead of resenting the priests audacity, blushingly excused himself.&quot; Both 
drinking and enganging in debauched sexual activities was inherited by Akbar 
from his ancestors.</p>
<p>Abul Fazl in Ain-i-Akbari (Blochmann,V.1,p.276), &quot;.. His majesty has 
established a wine shop near the palace ... The prostitues of the realm 
collected at the shop could scarcely be counter, so large was their number .. 
The dancing girls used to be taken home by the courtiers. If any well known 
courtier wanted to have a virgin they should first have His Majesty's [Akbar's] 
permission. In the same way, boys prostituted themselves, and drunkeness and 
ignorance soon lead to bloodshed ... His Majesty [Akbar] himself called some of 
the prostitutes and asked them who had deprived them of their virginity?&quot; This 
was the state of affairs during Akbar's rule, where alcoholism, sodomy, 
prostitution and murderous assaults were permitted by the king himself. The 
conditions of the civic life during Akbar's life is shocking!</p>
<p>Sodomy was a precious service of Akbar's own family. Babur, Akbar's 
grandfather, has given a lengthy description of this sodomic infatuation for a 
male sweetheart. Humayun was no different. Though perhaps Akbar did not engage 
in sodomy, he &quot;allowed&quot; it to be practiced by his servants, courtiers and 
sycophats. Abul Fazal in Ain-e-Akbari provides accounts of some such acts which 
are too disgusting to even mention. Such perverse gratification was prevelant 
during the Moghal rule, and in Akbar's times.</p>
<p>That Akbar remained monogamous throughout his life is indeed history 
falsified myth. Again quoting V.Smith (pp.47),&quot;.. Akbar, throughout his life, 
allowed himself ample latitude in the matter of wives and concubines!&quot; and 
further, &quot; Akbar had introduced a whole host of Hindu the daughters of eminent 
Hindu Rajah's into his harem.&quot; (pp.212). An account of how the Jaipur rulers 
were coerced into sending their daughters to the Mogul harem is found in Dr. 
Srivastava's book Akbar - The Mogul (Vol.1). Shelat notes (p.90),&quot; (after the &quot;Jauhar&quot; 
that followed the killing of Rani Durgawati) the two women left alive, 
Kamalavati (sister of Rani Durgawati) and the daughter of the Raja of Purangad 
(daughter-in-law of the deceased queen) were sent to Agra to enter Akbar's 
harem.&quot; It should also be observed that adimittance into Akbar's harem was 
available mainly to virgins and others' were &quot;disqualified&quot;. Inspite of such 
disgusting and lewd personal affairs, inducting women of abducted or killed 
Hindu warriors into his harem as slaves and prostitutes, it is bewildering that 
Akbar is hailed as a righteous and noble emperor.</p>
<p>The personality and nature of Akbar has been nicely summed up by the Editor 
of Father Monserrate's Commentarius. The editor's introduction states, &quot;In the 
long line of Indian soverigns, the towering personalities of Ashoka and Akbar 
(because of his dread) stand high above the rest... Akbar's greed for conquest 
and glory and his lack of sincerity form a marked contrast to Ashoka's paternal 
rule, genuine self-control and spiritual ambition. Akbar's wars were those of a 
true descendent of Timur, and had all the gruesome associations which this fact 
implies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The old notion that Akbar's was a near approximation to Plato's philosopher 
king has been dissipated by modern resarches. His character with its mixture of 
ambition and cunning has now been laid bare. He has been rightly compared to a 
pike in a pond preying upon his weaker neighbours .. Akbar was unable to give up 
his polygamous habits, for no importance needs to be attached to the bazaar 
gossip of the time that he once intended to distribute his wives among his 
grandees.&quot;</p>
<p>Whole of India was reduced to a brothel during the Moghal rule and Akbar, one 
of the Emperors, is being glorified as one of the patrons of the vast brothel. 
The above instances may suffice to convince the impartial reader that Akbar's 
whole career was a saga of uninhibited licentiousness backed by the royal brute.</p>
<p>Akbar's Barbarites</p>
<p>Glancing at the events in the reign of Akbar, it is a compelling deduction 
that he was no less cruel a tyrant than any of his ancestors. With his 
trecherous nature and the unlimited power than he wielded over a vast region 
qualifies him to be one of the foremost tyrants and sadists in India's history, 
or perhaps, even world history.</p>
<p>Vincent Smith (p.50) says that in a privately executing Kamran's son [namely, 
Akbar's own cousin] at Gwalior in 1565, &quot;.. Akbar set an evil example, initiated 
on a large scale by his descendents Shahjahan and Aurangzeb.&quot; This does not 
cause a serious alarm knowing the percious heritage of duplicity and trechery 
handed down to Akbar by his ancestors. Generations of martial races (Rajputs) 
were cut off by his (Akbar) sword ... he was long ranked with Shahbuddin and 
Alla (Allauddin) and other instruments of destruction, and with every just 
claim; and like these he constructed a Mumbar (a pulpit for islamic preachers) 
for the Koran from the altar of Eklingji (the deity of the Rajput warriors).&quot; 
(Todd, p.259) Not only that he forcibly annihilated innumerable humans, he also 
had no respect for temples and deities and willingly indulged in destruction of 
such places of worship.</p>
<p>That Akbar refused to strike a helpless and injured prisoner seems to be 
utterly false. At an tender age of 14, Akbar slashed the neck of his Hindu 
adversary Hemu brought before him unconcious and bleeding. After the fateful 
battle of Panipat, the unconcious Hemu was brought before Akbar who smote Hemu 
on his neck with his scimitar, and in Akbar's presence, the bystanders also 
plunged their swords into the bleeding corpse. Hemu's head was sent to Kabul and 
his trunk was gibbeted at one of the gates of Delhi. After victorious forces 
pushing south from Panipat after that great victory (at Panipat), writes Smith 
(pp.29), &quot;marched straight into Delhi, which opened its gates to Akbar, who made 
his entry in state. Agra was also passed into his possession. In accordance with 
the ghastly custom of the times, a tower was built with the heads of the slain. 
Immense treasures were taken with the family of Hemu whose aged father was 
executed.&quot; This &quot;tower of heads&quot; tradition and ceremony was religuously 
preserved by the &quot;magnanimous&quot; Akbar.</p>
<p>After the capture of Chittor, says Smith (p.64), &quot;.. Akbar exasperated by the 
obstinate resistance offered to his arms, treated the town and garrison with 
merciless severity. The 8000 strong Rajput garrison having been zealously helped 
during the seige by 40,000 peasants, the emperor ordered a general massacre 
which resulted in the death of of 30,000 (even thought the struggle was over). 
Many were made prisoners.&quot; Such terrible was his humanitarian outlook as towards 
his defeated adverseries. L.M. Shelat writes more on this incident that 
(pp.105), &quot;neither the temples nor the towers escaped the vandalism of the 
invaders&quot;. There were events where intolerant Akbar ordered the excision of one 
man's tongue, trampling opponents to death by elephants and other private or 
informal executions and assacinations. After a victorious battle at Ahemadabad, 
in accordance with the gruesome custom at the times, a pyramid was built with 
the heads of the rebels, more than 2000 in number. At one time, enraged on 
seeing a hapless lamplighter coiled up near his couch, Akbar order that the 
servant be shreded into thousand pieces! What else can one expect the barbaric 
and unscrupulous Akbar?</p>
<p>Akbar's reign of horrid cruelties includes the following incident which must 
be considered the jewel in the crown of horrid pastimes. Vincent Smith writes 
(pp.56) &quot;An extraordinary incident which occured in April while the royal camp 
was at Thanesar, the famous Hindu place of pilgrimage to the north of Delhi, 
throws a rather unpleasant light on Akbar's character... The Sanyasins assembled 
at the holy tank were divided into two parties, called the Kurs and Puris. The 
leader of the latter complained to the King that that the Kurs had unjustly 
occupied the accustomed sitting place of the Puris who were thus debarred from 
collecting the pilgrims' alms.&quot; They were asked to decide the issue by mortal 
combat. They were drawn up on either side with their arms drawn. In the fight 
that ensued the combatants used swords, bows, arrows and stones. &quot;Akbar seeing 
that the Puris were outnumbered gave a signal to some of his savage followers to 
help the weaker party.&quot; In this fight between the two Hindu sanyasin sects Akbar 
saw to it that both were ultimately annihilated by his own fierce soilders. The 
chronicler unctuously adds that Akbar was highly delighted with this sport. How 
can an emperor, so noble and great, can have a sadist mind that relishes and 
obtains &quot;delight&quot; by ordaining and watching two Hindu sanyansin sects being 
slaughtered?</p>
<p>Killing and massacring others' was regarded as a pastime and diversion by a 
bereaved Akbar. The chronicler Ferishta notes (Briggs, p.171), &quot;Prince Murad 
Mirza falling dangerously ill (May 1599) was buried at Shapoor. The corpse was 
afterwards removed to Agra, and laid by the side of Humayun, the prince's 
grandfather. The kings grief for the death of his son increased his desire for 
the conquering the Deccan, as a means of diverting the mind.&quot; Could there exist 
a more sinister kind of sadism?</p>
<p>Akbar's cruelty towards the Hindu women kidnapped and shut up in his harem 
were staggering and his much vaunted marriages said to have been contracted for 
communal integration and harmony were nothing but outrageous kidnappings brought 
about with the force of arms. This is apparent from Akbar's marriage to Raja 
Bharmal's daughter that occurred at Deosa &quot;when people Deosa and other places on 
Akbar's route fled away on his approach.&quot; (Shrivastava, pp.63). Why would the 
people flee in terror if at all Akbar was &quot;visiting&quot; Raja Bharmal and that the 
marraige was congenial and in consent with the bride's party? Far from 
abolishing the practice of Sati, Akbar invited the Jesuit priests to watch the &quot;considerble 
fun&quot; and supporting it by his weighty judgement and explicit approbation. (Monserrate's 
Commentary, pp.61).</p>
<p>Many more horried facts on Akbar's rule can be added. Even the infamous tax, 
which supposedly was abolished by Akbar, was continually being collected in 
Akbar's reign. A number of persons were secretly executed on Akbar's orders and 
a list of such people is provided by Vincent Smith. Akbar's reign was nothing 
but terror, torture and tyranny for his subjects and courtiers as is obvious 
from the quoted events. There are numerous other occasions and recorded events 
from Akbar's life that personifies him as a devil incarnate, contrary to what 
has been propagated.</p>
<p>Akbar's Fanaticism</p>
<p>Akbar was born a muslim, lived like a muslim and died as a muslim; that too a 
very fanatic one. Histories have dubbed him as a true believer who accomplished 
a synthesis of the best principles of all religions. The infamous Jiziya tax, 
which is special tax exaction from the Hindus, was never abolished by Akbar. 
Time and time again different people had approached seeking exemption from 
Jiziya. Everytime the exemption was ostensibly issued, but never was actually 
implemented. Throughout Akbar's reign, temples used to razed to the ground or 
misappropriated as mosques and cows were slaughtered in them, as happened in the 
battle at Nagarkot. No symbol of Hindu origin and design was spared from the 
iconoclastic wrath of Akbar.</p>
<p>Xavier, a Jesuit in Akbar's court, gives a typical instance of Akbar's 
perfidy in making people drink water in which his feet had been washed. Xavier 
writes, says Smith (p.189), Akbar posed &quot; as a Prophet, wishing it to be 
understood that he works miracles through healing the sick by means of the water 
in which he washed the feet.&quot; Badauni says that this [the above] special type of 
humiliation was reserved by Akbar only for Hindus. Says Badayuni, &quot;... if other 
than Hindus came, and wished to become disciples at any sacrifice, His Majesty 
reproved them.&quot; Where was his broadminded and tolerant nature then?</p>
<p>Yet another Xavier's letter (MacLagan, p.57 and Du Jarric, p.90) states, &quot;The 
Christian fathers got little opportunity of holding religious discussions with 
Akbar or influencing him in favour of Christianity ...Akbar silenced Xavier by 
telling him that the freedom accorded to him in preaching his religion was 
itself a great service.&quot; Akbar was not at all a tolerant of other religious 
faiths.</p>
<p>Akbar had filled both his hands with 50 gold coins when Badayuni expressed 
his strong desire to take part in a &quot;holy war&quot; (massacring Hindus) and &quot;dye 
these black moustachois and beard in (hindu) blood through loyalty to Your 
Majesty's person&quot; (sic). Akbar far from dispproving of Badayuni's despicable 
desire, gladly presented him with a decent premium.</p>
<p>The Hindus were treated as thirdclass citizens in Akbar's reign is evident 
from the Ain-i-Akbari. Abul Fazal writes, &quot;... he [Husayn Khan, Akbar's governer 
at Lahore] ordered the Hindus as unbelievers to wear a patch (Tukra) near the 
shoulders, and thus got the nick name of Tukriya (patcher).&quot; (Bochmann., p.403) 
The patch was obviously to mark the &quot;unbelievers&quot; out as pariahs for providing 
special degrading treatment.</p>
<p>The holy Hindu cities of Prayag and Banaras, writes Vincent Smith (p.58), 
were plundered by Akbar because their residents were rash enough to close their 
gates! No wonder Prayag of today has no ancient monuments -- whatever remain are 
a rubble! It is rather obvious that Akbar had no respect and reverance for 
cities considered holy by Hindus, let alone esteem for human life and property. 
Also, it is evident from this instance that Akbar's subjects were horrified and 
scared upon the arrival of their king into their city. If at all Akbar was so 
magnanimous, why then did not the people come forward and greet him?</p>
<p>Monserrate, a contemporary of Akbar, writes (p.27), &quot;the religious zeal of 
the Musalmans has destroyed all the idol temples which used to be numerous. In 
place of Hindu temples, countless tombs and little shrines of wicked and 
worthless Musalmans have been erected in which these men are worshipped with 
vain superstition as though they were saints.&quot; Not only did the muslims destroy 
the idols, but usurped the existing temples and converted them into tombs of 
insignificant people.</p>
<p>Akbar has neither any love or compassion for Hindus as is apparent from the 
above examples. Hindus were openly despised and contemptously treated under 
Akbar's fanatical rule as under any other rule. Akbar was only one of the many 
links of the despotic and cruel Moghal rule in India, and enforced the tradition 
of his forefathers with sincerity and equal ruthlessness.</p>
<p>Akbar's (mal) Administration</p>
<p>Akbar was so penurious and retentive of money that ..&quot; he considered himself 
to be heir of all his subjects, and ruthlessly seized the property of every 
deceased whose family had to make a fresh start ... Akbar was a hard headed man 
of business, not a sentimental philanthropist, and his whole policy was directed 
principally to the aquisition of power and riches. All the arrangements about 
Jagirs, branding (horses) etc., were devised for the one purpose namely, the 
enhancement of the power, glory and riches of the crown.&quot; (Smith, p.263). The 
latter statement indicates what a marvellous and altruist administrator Akbar 
was!</p>
<p>Akbar's lawless and rapacious rule also led to horrible famines -- Delhi was 
devastated and the mortality was enormous. Gujrat, one of the richest provinces 
in India, suffered severly for 6 months in 1573-74. Smith writes, &quot;The famine 
which began in 1595 and lasted three or four years until 1598 equalled in its 
horrors the accession year and excelled the visitation by reason of its longer 
duration. Inundation and epidemics occasionally marred Akbar's reign.&quot; And Akbar 
is said to have done nothing to ameliorate the sufferings of the masses, instead 
accumulated all the wealth he had amassed into forts and palaces.</p>
<p>Refering to the Gujarat famine, Dr. Shrivastava (p.169) writes, &quot;... the 
famine was not caused by drought or the failure of seasonal rains, but was due 
to the destruction wrought by prolonged wars and rebellions, constant marching 
and counter-marching of troops, and killing men on a large scale, and the 
breakdown of admnistrative machinary and the economic system ... The mortality 
rate was so high that on an average 100 cart-loads of dead bodies were taken out 
for burial in the city of Ahemadabad alone ..&quot;</p>
<p>Smith asserts that epidemics and inundiation often marred Akbar's reign, and 
at the time of such distress, writes Badayuni (Blochmann, p.391), parents were 
allowed to sell their children. Utter lawlessness and stately permissions to 
carry out immoral activities seem to the norm during Akbar's reign. Deadly 
pestilence and frightful famine appeared on the scene from time to time and 
lasted for years together, due to Akbar's callous and inadequate administrative 
capacities.</p>
<p>Noble in character that Akbar was that his generals and courtiers, even 
including his son Jehangir, revolted against him. Interminable wars and unending 
rebellions were continuing somewhere or the other in his so-called peaceful 
reign. Dr. Shrivastava nicely summarizes (p.381) , &quot;The vast empire hardly ever 
enjoyed complete immunity from some kind of disturbance and rebellion. Some 
chief or the other taking advantage of slackness of administration, lack of 
vigillance ... or the occurance of a natural calamity raised its head in revolt. 
It is tedious to recount cases of civil disturbance.&quot;. On an occasion of an 
accident, rumours spread about the seriousness of the injury and possibly the 
death of Akbar which caused revolts and rebellions in distant parts of the 
country, and many paraganas were plundered by turbulent people!</p>
<p>Had Akbar been do generous as he is often made out to be and his reign so 
just and kind, peace and contentment should have prevailed during his lifetime 
and upon his death, the subjects should have looked upon his children with 
devotion love and respect. However, due to nature of Akbar's rapacious rule, 
everyone from princes to paupers wished to overthrow Akbar.</p>
<p>The (usurped) Buildings</p>
<p>With constant famines, wars and revolts occuring the Akbar's era, where then 
did he get the time and money to construct buildings of magnificence and 
grandeur, like the Fort at Agra ? Akbar is said to have built several forts and 
palaces and founded many townships. However, as seen earlier, Akbar simply 
renamed pre-existing townships of Hindu origin and claimed to have been built by 
himself.</p>
<p>One such unfortunate township is that of Fatehpur Sikri. It has a massive 
defensive wall around it, enclosing redstone gateways and a majestic palace 
complex, explicitly in the Rajput style. It is the creation of these buildings 
and gateways that are accredited to Akbar. Fatehpur Sikri (or Fatehpur/Sikri) 
was an ancient independent principality before its occupation by the muslims. 
Testifying to this Todd says (p.240), &quot; [Rana Sangram Singh] came to the Mewar 
throne in 1509 A.D. Eighty thousand horses, seven Rajas of the highest rank, 
nine Raos and 104 cheiftains, bearing the titles of Rawal and Rawut with 500 
elephants follwed him into the field (against Babur). The princess of Marwar and 
Amber did him homage, and the Raos of Gwalior, Ajmer, *Sikri* ... served him as 
tributaries ..&quot; The above passage makes it clear that even during the reign of 
Akbar's grandfather Babur, Sikri was ruled by a &quot;Rao&quot;, who owed allegiance to 
Rana Sangram Singh of Mewar. Another reference to Fatehpur Sikri is of the year 
1405 (150 years before Akbar) when Ikbal Khan was killed and his head was sent 
to Fatehpur (E&amp;D, p.40). Also it is stated (E&amp;D, p.44) that Khizr Khan (the 
founder of Sayyad dynasty, 1500 A.D.) remained in *Fatehpur* and did not go to 
Delhi. Even Babur has stated that Agra and *Sikri* housed several palaces 
equally magnificent (E&amp;D, p.223). These 15th century references will, for now, 
suffice to prove the existence of Fatehpur Sikri before even Akbar was born, and 
that the beautiful buildings were not built by Akbar.</p>
<p>The Red Fort of Agra, also originally of Rajput design and construction, was 
usurped by Akbar. However, an account says that Akbar demolished the fort in 
1565, apparently for no reason, and constructed another in its place. 
Surprisingly, in 1566, Adham Khan was punished by being thrown down from the 
second storey of the royal apartments inside the fort! Keene (Handbook for 
Visitor's to Agra and Its Neighbourhood) quotes this rumour and casts a very 
pertinent doubt that is the fort was demolished in 1565, how is it possible for 
Akbar to stay there in 1566 and a man was flung down from the second story? 
Keene adds that even the foundation of the extensive fort could not have been 
complete within three years. Neither did Akbar demolish the fort, nor did he 
rebuild an entire structure. He simply comandeered the fort from its original 
inhabitants, and claimed to have been built by him.</p>
<p>Similarly, the palaces and mansions in Ajmer, Allahabad, Manoharpur and other 
townships were simply usurped by Akbar. He never ordered engineers and 
architects to build to build magnificent buildings. Testifying to this, 
Monserrate in his Commentarius (p.16) remarks, &quot;.. musalmans whose nature is 
indeed that of barbarians, take no interest in such things (erecting massive and 
ornate buildings and townships). Their chronicles being scanty and unreliable 
and full of old wives tales...&quot; The fraudulent claims that Akbar designed and 
built these monuments are fabricated stories written by muslim chroniclers 
toadying</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Akbar's life has been full of acts of cruelties, barbaric behaviour, lust for 
women and wine. Considering the background in which Akbar was brought up and the 
environment in which he lived, it was indeed a surprise that he would develop 
qualities of compassion and love. Even assuming that such miracles can occur, 
unfortunately, Akbar's reign and state of administration contradict such an 
assumption and one is compelled to conclude that Akbar was no better a monarch 
than his forefathers. Apparently from what was described above, Akbar has been 
given unecessary credit of being tolerant, secular and an altruist king. His 
sycophantic courtiers, including the court chroniclers, alloted to him all the 
praises he desired. Upon some inspection, the nine-gem story of Akbar's court 
becomes a sheer invention of court flatterers, who sought Akbar's favour for 
self-aggrandizement. Akbar's recalcitrance and callousless in the matters of 
caring for his subjects and domain, led to untold misery in the form of famines 
and pestilence. Wars, revolts and rebellions constantly erupted concluding is 
mass mayhem and killings. There was no tranquility nor peace in Akbar's reign, 
let alone material and spiritual prosperity. That an avaricious miser Akbar was, 
it is rather unbelievable for him to have spent on creating expensive buildings 
and mansions. He was no better than other muslim monarchs, constantly on the 
prey to usurp power and pelf by whatever means they could. Morality and 
humanitarian principles took a back seat to self aggrandizement and lechery. 
Even after exercising numerous abductions, kidnappings, murders Akbar have been 
refered to as noble, compassionate and great. Even though religious fanatism 
never decreased in his reign, nay, was sponsored by Akbar himself, he has been 
termed as a secular, broadminded person. Such blunders of a serious magnitude 
have been committed by historians reconstructing and writing accounts on Indian 
history.</p>
<p>It may be worthwhile to research and present the &quot;true&quot; story of Akbar 
exposing to the world the true nature of Akbar and his personality. The Moghal 
rule in India was indeed very ruthless and full of difficult times for the 
people and the country; truly a &quot;dark&quot; age.</p>
