<hr>

<p align="left" style="MARGIN-TOP: 0px"><b>A REVOLUTION IS TAKING
PLACE</b> in Bangladesh that threatens trouble for the region and
beyond if left unchallenged. Islamic fundamentalism, religious
intolerance, militant Muslim groups with links to international
terrorist groups, a powerful military with ties to the militants,
the mushrooming of Islamic schools churning out radical students,
middle-class apathy, poverty and lawlessness--all are combining
to transform the nation.</p>

<p align="left">Sounds familiar? Just like Pakistan, its former
overlord, this nation of 130 million people--the third-most
populous in the Muslim world--is slowly moving away from its
tradition of moderate Islam. And the government seems powerless
and unwilling to stem the tide, which includes growing attacks on
moderate Muslims and the dwindling Hindu population.</p>

<p align="left">The instability has caused concern overseas among
the country's donors, who decided during an annual meeting in
Paris in March to tie future development aid to an improvement in
the deteriorating law-and-order situation. But the United States
and its allies seem to have paid scant attention to the deeper
long-term danger as they expand the war on terrorism from Central
Asia to Southeast Asia.</p>

<p align="left">&quot;There are some extremists here, but they
belong to fringe groups and are not part of the mainstream,&quot;
says a senior Western envoy in Dhaka, trying to downplay the
threat.</p>

<p align="left">The country's two leading parties--the secular,
left-leaning Awami League and the conservative Bangladesh
Nationalist Party--were quick to condemn the September 11
terrorist attacks in the U.S., which left a number of
Bangladeshis dead. At a time when the country was being ruled by
an interim government ahead of a general election in October,
both offered cooperation, including the use of Bangladesh
airspace for U.S. warplanes.</p>

<p align="left">But, in a sign of how the tide is changing, the
winning BNP's electoral alliance included the fundamentalist
Jamaat-e-Islami, which won 17 seats in the 300-member parliament.
The Jamaat, which actively opposed independence from Pakistan in
1971, now has a voice in government for the first time.</p>

<p align="left">Its leader, Matiur Rahman Nizami, was appointed
agriculture minister, while MP Ali Ahsan Mohammad got the social
welfare portfolio. &quot;In a developing, mainly agricultural
country like Bangladesh, these are powerful positions,&quot; says
another Western diplomat in the capital, Dhaka.</p>

<p align="left">The party, at least for the time being, has toned
down its calls for rigorous implementation of Islamic law and put
the focus on alleviating poverty. However, it clearly opposes the
U.S. war on terrorism and in October launched a fund to help the
&quot;innocent victims of America's war.&quot; It stopped asking
for offers when the radical Taliban were kicked out of power in
Afghanistan in November.</p>

<p align="left">While the Jamaat is moving cautiously toward its
goal of an Islamic state, its elevation to government has
encouraged other more extreme Islamic fundamentalist groups and
individuals. They range from rabble-rousing cleric Maulana
Ubaidul Haq to around a dozen radical groups often referred to as
the Bangladeshi Taliban.</p>

<p align="left">They include the shadowy
Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, which is believed to have been founded
as an offshoot of a Pakistani group in 1992 with money and
support from suspected global terrorist mastermind Osama bin
Laden. Western intelligence officials believe a certain Fazlul
Rahman, who signed bin Laden's February 23, 1998, declaration of
holy war on the U.S. on behalf of the Jihad Movement in
Bangladesh, is an associate of the now independent group.</p>

<p align="left">Moreover, the radicals' ranks are being swelled
by graduates from the estimated 64,000 madrassas, or religious
schools, which have mushroomed in the past decade and are
described by a retired high-ranking civil servant as a
&quot;potential political time bomb.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">Just as in Pakistan, the madrassas fill an
important function in a country where basic education is
available only to a few. But the government has no control over
them and, as journalist Salahuddin Babar wrote in a recent
edition of Probe magazine, &quot;passing out from the madrassas,
poorly equipped to enter mainstream life and professions, the
students are easily lured by motivated quarters who capitalize on
religious sentiment to create fanatics, rather than modern
Muslims.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">The madrassas' focus is on religious instruction
and many are funded by proselytizing Arab charities--as in
Pakistan, whose madrassas were the nurseries for many of
Afghanistan's Taliban leaders. Some analysts fear Bangladesh's
madrassas could also become exporters of Islamic revolution.</p>

<p align="left">In the immediate term, Bangladesh's secular
tradition is most at risk from the rise in fundamentalism.
Attacks on Hindus, who generally support the staunchly secular
Awami League, are increasing. &quot;The intimidation of the
minorities, which had begun before the election, became worse
afterwards,&quot; said The Society for Environment and Human
Development, a local non-governmental organization, in a report
on the October poll. An Amnesty International report concurred
and indicated that members of the BNP-led coalition were
responsible.</p>

<p align="left">But neighbouring India and Burma --which both
have Muslim minorities--are also at risk, while the Western world
cannot afford to be complacent either, analysts say.</p>

<p align="left">For example, Maulana Ubaidul Haq, preaching to
hundreds of thousands of people, including cabinet ministers, at
the national mosque in Dhaka, condemned the U.S. war on terrorism
and called for a jihad against the Americans. &quot;President
Bush and America is the most heinous terrorist in the world. Both
America and Bush must be destroyed. The Americans will be washed
away if Bangladesh's 120 million Muslims spit on them,&quot; the
cleric snarled in an address marking the Eid-ul-Fitr Muslim
festival in December.</p>

<p align="left">Thousands of Islamic militants took part in
anti-U.S. street protests, many brandishing posters of bin Laden,
while the fighting was taking place in Afghanistan.</p>

<p align="left">More ominously, senior Indian police officers
tell the REVIEW that Harkat gunmen were involved in a January 22
attack on the American Cultural Centre in Calcutta that left four
of their colleagues dead. Furthermore, Indian intelligence
officials accuse Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence agency,
which long backed the Taliban in Afghanistan, of securing a
foothold in West Bengal through the infiltration of extremists
across the border with Bangladesh. These charges are angrily
denied by Dhaka.</p>

<p align="left">The Indian police and analysts also claim that
the Harkat group has links with banned Islamic militant groups in
Pakistan, such as Jaish-e-Mohammed and Laskar-e-Toiba, and the
Middle East.</p>

<p align="left">There is also evidence that Harkat members and
Muslim refugees from Burma--the Rohingyas (See story on page
17)--have been sent to fight against the Indians in Kashmir, the
anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan and the Russians in Chechnya
since the late 1990s.</p>

<p align="left">Meanwhile, the REVIEW met young Muslim radicals
from Malaysia and Indonesia in the southeast coastal towns of
Cox's Bazar and Chittagong who were meeting with local Muslim
groups. Their presence adds fuel to fears that Bangladesh could
become a haven for militants of all nations.</p>

<p align="left">But while the threat is growing, the influence of
fundamentalism is nothing new. The door was opened by the
military, who needed to find a support base to counter the
secular, leftist policies of the Awami League, when the two fell
out not long after leading the country to independence.</p>

<p align="left">The next major step came when Lt.-Gen. Hussain
Muhammad Ershad , who ruled the country from 1982-90, declared
Islam as the state religion. He also brought the Jamaat back in
from the cold to help crush the secular opposition. The armed
forces are believed to retain close contacts with
fundamentalists.</p>

<p align="left">Ironically, the rest of the world first became
acquainted with the growing religious intolerance and creeping
fundamentalism in Bangladesh in 1993, when Muslim author Taslima
Nasrin fled the country after receiving death threats for being
critical about aspects of Islam in her writings. She returned to
see her dying mother in 1998, but was soon forced to flee once
more. Bangladeshi human-rights groups say the Harkat was behind
the threats against her and the attempted murder in early 1999 of
popular poet Shamsur Rahman, symbol of the nation's secular
identity. The 70-year old also chaired a national committee of
editors, writers and artists dedicated to resisting
fundamentalist forces opposed to individualism and democracy.</p>

<p align="left"><b>GOVERNMENT INACTION<br>
</b>But despite the clear evidence of creeping fundamentalism
over the past decade, successive governments, including the
current one, seem either unable or unwilling to tackle the
problem.</p>

<p align="left">Awami League leader Sheikh Hasina Wajed, whose
government was ousted at the October poll, said in mid-March that
the new BNP-led coalition government has created &quot;a reign of
terror across the country.&quot; Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, in
turn, accused the Awami League of being engaged in a
&quot;conspiracy to disrupt peace&quot; and pledged that her
government is determined to &quot;control terrorism with an iron
hand.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">The law-and-order situation must be tackled if
Bangladesh is to continue receiving the overseas aid it relies
on. But neither party seems to link the violence to a growing
fundamentalist threat--they blame each other for it and so fail
to address the root causes. Coalition government officials deny
there is any such problem while the middle class tend to dismiss
the fundamentalists as irrelevant. Begum Zia, responding to
opposition charges about her Jamaat cabinet colleagues, insisted
there were no Taliban in her government, according to a report in
India's The Hindu newspaper on January 11.</p>

<p align="left">The overseas community, while concerned about
increased violence, also seems to downplay the threat. Some
observers say this may partly be because their intelligence
channels are not very good, adding that most Western embassies in
Dhaka are aid-oriented. When British Prime Minister Tony Blair
visited in January--defying street protests--the war on terrorism
was high on the agenda and Bangladesh offered to join an
international security force in Afghanistan.</p>

<p align="left">But it seems the growing religious extremism and
intolerance within Bangladesh, and the rise of groups linked to
overseas militant groups, were not addressed in depth during his
meetings with government officials.</p>

<p align="left">For the time being Bangladesh's secular roots are
holding, but the fundamentalist cause is in the ascendant. And as
the rise of militant Muslim groups in Indonesia has shown,
economic collapse and political crisis can galvanize support for
extremists very quickly.</p>

<p align="left">The process is not irreversible, but if left
unchallenged for too long, Bangladesh could deteriorate and
become a new nest for terror. There is still time for a
counter-revolution.</p>
