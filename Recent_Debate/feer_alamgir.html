  <font size="6"><b>
  <p align="justify">W</b></font>hen the horrendous handling of the FEER article
  issue still attracting a lot of flaks, our Govt again went about the Danish
  Aid withdrawal issue in its most callous way, just what was expected from our
  political guardians? I just wonder if we are ever going learn the educated way
  of handling of things.</p>
  <p align="justify">The banning of FEER and taking them to court immediately
  without giving any look into the allegations have only brought shame to the
  country in the international arena. Now we are again going to the length of
  challenging the Danish Govt to prove their allegations. I hope the Govt
  don’t go to the length of taking Danish Govt to court on defamation charges.
  I just wonder why we can’t just be a little more rational and learn to
  handle such issues in a civilized way.</p>
  <p align="justify">I don’t believe just a FEER article can bring shame to
  our country if we are really not what as being reflected in the article, the
  truth is bound to prevail and we must have come out clean if appropriate steps
  being taken. It is rather the Govt’s unthoughtful reactions to these issues
  which is bringing added shame and unforeseen consequences, which can very
  grave, to our nation.</p>
  <p align="justify">I don’t wish to give any knowledge to our Govt which is
  pointless anyway but I just want to cite a couple of examples which can, I
  think, make our Govt and people give a rethink to their attitude. Malaysia has
  long been targeted by the US as everybody knows and the post 9/11 period was
  definitely not smooth for Mahathir.</p>
  <p align="justify">Two major allegations were made against Malaysia during
  that period which I believe were graver than the FEER allegation. Firstly
  Whitehouse sought to take over-n-covert actions in Malaysia (along with
  Indonesia), similar way in Afghanistan, alleging the presence of Al-Qaida
  cells inside their territory. What was Mahathir’s response, a cool one: We
  don’t think we need America’s assistance to fight terrorism; if they have
  any intelligence data we will definitely look into it.</p>
  <p align="justify">Second allegation was, when the CBI investigation found out
  a Malaysian national was closely involved in the 9-11 attack, white house came
  out with this sensation-creating allegation that ‘Malaysia was the
  launching-pad for the Sept-11 attack’. Mahathir’s reply was again simple,
  ‘I don’t think just one person’s involvement makes Malaysia the
  launching-pad for the attack when all the terrorist got their training and
  everything inside the US’. Of course Malaysia had arrested the terrorist
  even before America found his link to the attack.</p>
  <p align="justify">Even after such wild allegations, I believe Malaysia’s
  impression has only brightened to the world and even to Whitehouse after the
  Sept-11 tragedy and Mahathir getting frequent invitations and meetings with Mr
  Bush. I just wonder, if those kind of wild allegations were made against our
  country how our mindless Govt could have reacted! I just don’t understand
  why the judicious guardian of the country couldn’t initiate an investigation
  and ask FEER as well as the Danish Govt to assist in it instead of going for
  such wild and ferocious rejections of the allegations.</p>
  <p align="justify">After the investigation if we were truly clean FEER and
  Danish Govt must have withdrawn their allegations and we could prove it to the
  world. Now I think every door has been closed to show our cleanness with
  unknown consequences to hang on over our shoulder. We need those money and aid
  and with such uncivilized behaviour on display, who is going to come to show
  sympathy to our country. It’s twenty first century and I think it’s time
  we learn some civility and rationality. Else we are doomed to be an isolated
  state like the Taliban’s Afghanistan, Saddam’s Iraq or Khomeini’s Iran.
  Do we afford that?</p>
