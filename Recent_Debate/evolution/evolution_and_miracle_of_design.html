  <p>=====================================================</p>
  <p><span class="postbody">This post was brought to my attention by Avijit Roy,
  one of the personal friends of mine and the member of another discussion
  board. I was invited by him to accept the challenge of that interesting post
  on that site, and I mirror my response here.<br>
  <br>
  I'll first respond on moderator's introductory note, after that I'll make some
  comments on the Article &quot;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/6585">The
  miracle of design in the cell</a> written by Mr Yahya (posted by Dr. Alamgir
  Hussain). Moderator's note, as it is posted here, as rhetoric, not as
  argument. It consists of three&nbsp; “questions” (of creationist's) and a
  request for three definitions from evolutionists. I put the word
  “questions” in quotation marks because, as phrased, they are not really
  questions at all, but leading statements which bear little relationship to
  what is true. But, I will address them anyway.<br>
  <br>
  <b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff">Q1) So why is evolution given such
  a lofty status in science?</span></b></span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="postbody">Evolution is given status because it has turned
    out to be the central organizing principle of the biological sciences. There
    does not exist a single specialty of biology that makes sense without it. It
    (and ONLY it) effectively explains taxonomy, genetics, population genetics,
    comparative anatomy, botany, zoology, biostratigraphy, paleontology,
    biochemistry, ecology…. Do you want me to continue?<br>
    <br>
    Ideas achieve or lose “lofty status” in science based entirely on their
    explanatory power, and their ability to conform to the facts of nature
    better than competing ideas.<br>
    <br>
    Before the idea of evolution was understood, there really WAS no
    “biological science.” There was simply “<b>natural history</b>.”
    Since then, evolution and evolution based research has turned the biological
    sciences into one of the gems in the crown of human scientific understanding
    and achievement.<br>
    <br>
    In short, evolution has achieved its status as any scientific idea does. It
    has earned it because it is better at explaining the facts than all
    competing ideas.</span></p>

  <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff"><br>
  <b>Q2) Should not the theories of evolution be subjected to the same stringent
  tests as with true scientific theories?</b></span></span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="postbody"><br>
    This is not a question; it is actually a statement (and a false one at
    that). It is actually making the claim that the theories of evolution have
    NOT been subjected to the same stringent tests as other (the writer here
    misleadingly calls them “true”) scientific theories.<br>
    <br>
    Unfortunately for the moderator, as he put such statement as creationist's
    argument, is simply wrong in his contention. There are no scientific
    theories which have been more thoroughly tested, evaluated, and “put
    through the wringer” than the theories of evolution.<br>
    <br>
    What ARE all those biologists and paleontologists doing, if not testing
    these theories in their work every single day? What are ALL those articles
    in Science, and Nature, and Paleobiology about anyways, if not scientists
    testing these theories? How were able to reject Lamarck’s theory, and
    accept and improve on Darwin’s theory if we were not applying the “same
    stringent tests” as other theories?<br>
    <br>
    Obviously, one may further confused (as my friend logical sometimes appears
    as well) by the difference between fact and theory. Theories do not BECOME
    facts, theories EXPLAIN facts. <b>Evolution is both a FACT and a THEORY</b>.<br>
    <br>
    Darwin gave us a theory (natural selection) to explain a fact (descent with
    modification). It currently remains (with improvement and augmentation) the
    best theory we have to explain the fact of evolution. It may be further
    changed, modified or replaced, for science is tentative and progresses.<br>
    <br>
    In the same way, gravity is both a fact and a theory. Less than a hundred
    years ago, we watched one theory of gravitation (Newton’s) replaced by
    another, better theory of gravitation (Einstein’s), but apples did not
    suspend themselves in mid-air awaiting the outcome of the debate.<br>
    <br>
    Likewise, evolution has occurred and man has descended from apelike
    ancestors (and ultimately reptiles and fish) whether or not Darwin’s
    theory of natural selection ultimately proves to be THE right theory to
    explain it.</span></p>

  <b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00ffff">Q3) Why is evolution given the
  privilege such that even without definite proof, it is classified as science?</span></b></span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="postbody">This “question” rather than making a claim
    that is untrue (as in Q2) simply decides to abandon the understanding of
    science altogether. There does not exist a SINGLE idea in science that
    possesses what anyone might call “definite proof.” Science is tentative,
    always open to revision, always available to be falsified and improved.
    Ideas that claim to possess “definite proof” are not science, they are
    dogma.<br>
    <br>
    In reality, evolution and its theories enjoy no privilege with in science.
    They are of a status exactly equivalent to any other equally supported
    scientific ideas,<br>
    <br>
    Finally, the “challenger” presents three requests for definition. Only
    the first two of them are terms of science, but that’s okay, I’ll
    discuss all three.<br>
    <br>

  <p><span class="postbody"><b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ccffcc">D1.
  Define evolution.</span></b><br>
  <br>
  </span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="postbody">Although it has several definitions, it is clear
    that the author is looking for a definition relevant to this discussion, so
    that is the only one I will give.<br>
    <br>
    Evolution is the process by which living organisms are modified over
    multiple generations allowing for speciation and diversification and
    resulting (over longer periods) in dramatic genetic and morphological
    change.<br>
    <br>
    Put simply, it is the idea that all living organisms on the planet earth
    have descended from one, or a very few number of common ancestors.<br>
    <br>
    </span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span class="postbody"><b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ccffcc">D2.
  Define species.</span></b></span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="postbody"><br>
    A species can be defined either taxonomically or genetically.<br>
    <br>
    Taxonomically, a species is any population of organisms that share enough
    similarity to be included in the same binomial taxon. Example: our species
    is Homo sapiens. Orangutans are Pongo pygmaeus. Dogs are Canis familiaris.<br>
    <br>
    Genetically, a species is any population of organisms than can interbreed
    successfully and produce fertile offspring. For example, horses and donkeys
    are DIFFERENT species because their offspring (mules) are sterile. Kodiak
    bears and Grizzly bears are the SAME species, because their offspring are
    fertile. A species, therefore, is a unit composed of organisms that can
    successfully interbreed. Should a genetic barrier to reproduction arise
    between two populations of what was one species, then we now have at least
    one new species, and we say that “speciation” has occurred.<br>

  <p><span class="postbody"><b><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ccffcc">3. Define
  missing link.</span></b><br>
  <br>
  </span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="postbody">“Missing link” is not a scientific term. It is
    a newspaper term that was popularized by the commercial media during the
    last few years of the 19thtcentury. It was originally coined to refer to the
    “missing link” between humans and apes, and was regularly applied to
    fossil findings that fit the preconceived popular notions of what such a
    “link” might look like. So, Neandertals were once referred to as
    “missing links” (even though they had actually been found) as was
    Dubois’ Java Man (Homo erectus), Peking Man (Homo erectus), Leakey’s
    “Zinjanthropus” (Australopithecus boisei), Darts “Southern Ape Man”
    (Australopithecus africanus) and Johansen’s “Lucy” (Australopithecus
    afarensis).<br>
    <br>
    The biggest problem with the term “missing link” is that it assumes that
    evolution works in a linear, directional way. And it does not. But popular
    misconceptions of this type still find their way into the press accounts of
    paleontological discoveries, as well as into the rhetoric of creationists.</span></p>

  <p><span class="postbody">Now I I'll make some comments on the Article &quot;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/6585">The
  miracle of design in the cell</a> written by Mr Yahya. I again </span>thank&nbsp;
  Avijt, for sharing this fascinating example of creationist “gee whiz”
  literature. I call it “gee whiz” because it as a great example of the
  stock creationist “argument from ignorance.” The underlying message is,
  “<b><i>The cell is just SO amazing, that I can’t imagine how it might have
  evolved. And since I can’t imagine it, it must not have happened.</i></b>”<br>
  <br>
  I cannot tell you how often I find myself giving thanks that science and
  scientific progress is not limited by the “imaginations” of some of its
  detractors. I am grateful for all the imaginations better than my own that
  have delivered us the modern technological world in which we live. I
  certainly, as a child, could not have imagined much of what I now encounter
  routinely during my day. But I never for a second would have held MY
  imagination up as the standard for what was possible.<br>
  <br>
  The article, “The miracle of design in the cell,” depends on the reader
  accepting blindly a number of explicit assertions and some additional
  implications that are simply not true. All else follows from accepting those
  initial false premises. So rather than harp on the silly anthropomorphism that
  allows the author to call the cell membrane “conscious” and “wise,”
  I’ll concentrate on exposing the falsity of the premises on which the
  article is based.<br>
  <br>
  The author sets us up by claiming that “the cell is by far the most complex
  structure mankind has ever encountered, as is also agreed by the scientific
  community.” This is so far from the truth that I had to stop myself from
  laughing out loud when I read it. Some cells are VERY complex, true. Most are
  not. But if a cell is complex, wouldn’t a combination of two or more cells
  be at least twice as complex?<br>
  <br>
  I have never heard or read a single scientist make such a silly claim as this.
  I for one would vote for the human brain as “the most complex structure
  mankind has ever encountered,” but that’s just me. Any representative
  sampling of a dozen scientists would come up with at least three or four other
  candidates for the position.<br>
  <br>
  The author extends this claim of transcendent complexity with his “gee
  whiz” trump card. He writes, “In order for the cell to survive, all the
  basic components of the cell, each performing many vital functions, have to be
  intact. If the cell came into existence by evolution, then millions of its
  components had to simultaneously exist in the same place and they had to come
  together in a particular order and plan.”<br>
  <br>
  It is here that the author stakes his entire argument, and it is here that his
  argument completely falls apart, for this statement is simply, objectively,
  demonstrably not true.<br>
  <br>
  It is clear that cells did not (and did not NEED to) arise suddenly with all
  the current complexity of the most sophisticated cells already in place and
  fully functioning.<br>
  <br>
  They, like all other biological entities, can be shown to have developed over
  time in a stepwise, evolutionary process.<br>
  <br>
  The fact that there are different kinds of cells TODAY (some complex, some
  not) proves that a cell DOES NOT need all these components to exist, or to
  survive, or even to thrive. The complex cells of the type discussed by this
  author are only the end result of a lengthy evolutionary history that included
  stages when cells did less and were less complex.<br>
  <br>
  Look (for just one example) at the difference between Prokaryotes and
  Eukaryotes. Prokaryotes are living cells, and include Monera (simple bacteria)
  and Archaea. Simply stated, prokaryotes are molecules surrounded by a membrane
  and cell wall. Prokaryotic cells lack characteristic eukaryotic subcellular
  membrane enclosed &quot;organelles&quot;, but may contain membrane systems
  inside a cell wall.<br>
  <br>
  These cells do not need mitochondria, or golgi apparatus, or ribosomes, or
  chloroplasts, or even nuclei. They are VERY SIMPLE organisms, certainly not
  among the “most complex structures that mankind has ever encountered.”
  They lack MOST of the “components” and are unable to perform MOST of the
  “vital functions” that the author insists a cell requires “in order to
  survive.” Yet they survive quite well, and are arguably the most successful
  organisms on the planet. They’ve been around longer than any other living
  thing, they routinely kill and eat us more complex organisms by the millions,
  and while we often talk of an “age of reptiles” or “age of mammals”
  the truth is that we have had only one age on Earth, and it’s ALWAYS been
  the age of bacteria.<br>
  <br>
  The evolutionary pathway from prokaryote to eukaryote is actually becoming
  quite clear. Complex eukaryotic cells appear to be symbiotic communities of
  multiple prokaryotes. Mitochondria (for example) even have their own DNA,
  since they were almost certainly at one time independent organisms.
  Chloroplasts in plants appear to have a similar origin.<br>
  <br>
  But the point here is that it is NOT a valid argument to take a complex,
  eukaryotic cell as an example of a “starting point” for anything. It is
  (I’ll say it again) an end result of an evolutionary process that had much
  simpler cells in its past.<br>
  <br>
  This is where one is compelled to ask the question as to whether the author
  REALLY couldn’t imagine an evolutionary scenario, or whether they were
  simply being disingenuous. For seriously, how much imagination does it take to
  read a text on cell biology and SEE FIRST HAND (no imagination required) that
  there are still living simple cells that do NOT need to perform all the
  “vital functions” this author insists are necessary?<br>
  <br>
  Of course, at this time the author is likely to say, “Well, then BACTERIA
  are THEMSELVES too complex to have suddenly arisen with everything in working
  order.” To which I would counter, they DIDN’T “suddenly” arise either,
  but also came from less complex forerunners. Take a virus for example: We
  can’t even decide whether or not they’re actually alive, and all they
  consist of is a protein shell and a piece of genetic material.<br>
  <br>
  His description of the form and function of a cellular membrane is too
  &quot;over the top&quot; to really take seriously. Ignoring his insistence on
  conferring the cell membrane with such attributes as wisdom, consciousness,
  memory, decision making skills, and even (can you believe it) list keeping, he
  seems to have a vision of membrane performance that is at huge variance with
  reality. In fact, he seems to elevate simple osmosis to a status of artistic
  virtuosity that even a Picasso or a Beethoven would despair of achieving.<br>
  <br>
  Do cell membranes “never allow in more than what the cell needs?” No, they
  OFTEN let in more than what the cell needs.<br>
  <br>
  Is it true that “there is not a single unnecessary, purposeless molecule in
  a cell?” Of course not. Even most of our genetic material is “unnecessary
  and purposeless,” let alone the random chemicals and molecules that flood
  our systems (and our cells) from a purely environmental basis.<br>
  <br>
  Does the cell membrane “not permit even minor errors?” What nonsense is
  that? Every cell membrane permits many errors. Most cells can handle a certain
  amount of trauma, uncertainty and suboptimal performance. And those that
  can’t actually do die. All the time. Every day. By the millions.<br>
  <br>
  It helps no one’s argument to argue from fantasy, rather than reality. The
  author’s constant attitude of “gee whiz, isn’t that amazing” might be
  ameliorated just a little if he had a more realistic understanding of the
  object of his amazement.<br>
  <br>
  I guess in final analysis, the argument is false because it ASSUMES the act of
  creation rather than tries to prove it. When the author is saying that all
  these things had to come together fully formed at exactly the same time,
  he’s not saying that evolution is impossible, because evolution clearly
  doesn’t require that. His posited straw man of simultaneous, fully
  functioning, complex eukaryotes sounds a LOT more like creation than it does
  like evolution.<br>
  <br>
  And I would have to agree with the circular argument that for creation to have
  occurred, creation has to have occurred. But science does not insist of
  special creation for living cells, only this author does.</p>
