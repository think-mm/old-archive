  <p><font color="#0000FF">I went through the articles and information you have

  all of the articles in you publications are based on other people derivations

  here in USA, Florida some of the publication I reviewed for my desertation had
  wrong conclusion from the origional authors intetns. The understanding of the

  rather they were 180 degree opposite in meaning. Their conclusions were
  entirely different than the perspective of the originality of the origional
  author. In this liu I humbly ask Dr. Ajoy K. Roy to take a challenge from
  people like us and study the Quran first hand in Arabic and give us a better
  understanding of what it says rather than referring to the material who have
  extracted wrongly because of their improper understanding of the material, or

  <b>Subject:</b>&nbsp; Re: Mukto-mona Article about Islam on your website, need
  more help<br>
  </p>
  <p>Dear Mr. Husain:</p>
  <p>I appreciate for visiting our site and writing in Mukto-Mona.&nbsp;
  However, I am unable to figure out what exactly you are challenging and&nbsp;
  to whom your challenged is being referred to. You mentioned Dr. Ajoy K. Roy's
  name in you mail, but Dr. Roy does not debate on Islam. His area of interest
  is human rights violation and minority oppression in the subcontinent. He is
  more focused on current political affairs, and I don't think he wrote any
  piece criticizing Quran or Islamic scripture so far. So your challenge is
  misplaced and misdirected.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>However, we have some members who particularly write on Islam. Here I am
  enlisting three Bangladeshi prolific writers with whom you can debate. They
  are all distinguished scholars in their own discipline, authors of several
  books, and their scholarly articles on Islam (skeptic view) have regularly
  been published online dailies and&nbsp; many on line forums. You may want to
  check their pages:</p>
  <p><b>Abul Kasem:</b></p>
  <p><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/kasem/index.html">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/kasem/index.htm</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Syed Kamran Mirza:</b></p>
  <p><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/skm/index.html">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/skm/index.htm</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Mohammad Asghar:</b></p>
  <p><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/asghar/index.html">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/asghar/index.htm</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Please let me know whether you are interested in. Please also mention with
  whom and&nbsp; which particular topic you are interested to choose. You must
  specifically mention any of the author's article/s and the points of
  contention there in. If you are unable to decide please let me know. I will
  formulate a format for you.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Please do not dwell too much on original Arabic and Translation issue.&nbsp;
  Many of our authors uses widely accepted translation(s) of Quran. All these
  translators are recognized without dispute as well versed in Arabic and Islam.
  The Bangladeshi believers who propagate these views that translation is not
  accepted cannot be any more knowledgeable in Arabic than the respected
  translators like Dawood, Shakir, Pickthall, Yusuf Ali to challenge their
  translations as inaccurate.</p>
  <p>Secondly, A translator may differ in poetic/aesthetic/phonetic quality of
  the original Arabic, but CANNOT alter/twist the FACTUAL CONTENT of it. (Like
  &quot;4&quot; cannot change to &quot;3&quot;, or &quot;yes&quot; cannot change
  to &quot;no&quot;, or&nbsp; &quot;kill&quot; cannot be turned to
  &quot;kiss&quot; etc.)</p>
  <p>Thirdly, Language of hate, love, admire or cruelty is generic and
  universal, they cannot be twisted by misinterpretation and does not vary from
  language to language.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fourthly, The translations of Yusuf Ali, Shakir, Pickthall agree with one
  another.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Fifthly, Please Remember that Quran repeatedly claims to be a &quot;clear
  book&quot; (5:15) &quot;easy to understand” (44:58 , 54:22 , 54:32, 54:40)
  &quot;explained in detail&quot; (6:114), &quot;conveyed clearly&quot;, (5:16,
  10:15) and with “no doubt” in it (2:1). So I don't think lack of
  &quot;better understanding&quot; is any issue here.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you are still not satisfied by the logic stated above, I can arrange an
  Arabic speaking apostate for you, instead of Bengali origin. Please let me
  know in advance. Please also let me know which format you want for debate. One
  particular format is given bellow from Dr. Ali Sina's site ( Dr. Sina, BTW, is
  well-acquainted with Arabic and Persian language):</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/debates/Shahzad.htm">http://www.faithfreedom.org/debates/Shahzad.htm</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I am not interested to debate on particularly Islamic faith (though I have
  some articles on this issue too) at this moment, as my area of interest is
  science, rationalism, freethinking and metaphysics. If you want to have a
  debate with me then you are most welcome. You may want to check my page for
  reference&nbsp;:</p>
  <p><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/index.html">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/index.htm</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Please let me know whether you are interested. You might also want to check
  Dr. Jaffor Ullah, Aparthib, Alamgir Hussain, Imran Hossain, M RS, Mughal,
  fatemolla or anyone from the author section of our site for your interest.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A team of moderator will&nbsp; supervise the debate and the ground rules
  for the debate will be laid out clearly. Anyone contravening the rules of
  'engagement' will be declared the 'loser'. The transcript of the debate will
  be published in Mukto-mona serially and&nbsp; I will send to other dailies and
  forums as well.</p>
  <p>Best regards,</p>
  <p>Avijit<br>

  Dear Dr.Husain Bhai,<br>
  <br>
  I went through your message to Mukto-Mona.<br>
  <br>
  I noted many alphabets behind your name. You must be a scholar. Did<br>
  you have to study in Arabic to achieve the MS, MBA behind your<br>
  names? Plesae forgive my ignorance. What is PE? Did you have have<br>
  study that in Arabic too? If you did not, then why should one<br>
  understand Quran in Arabic only?<br>
  <br>
  I learned science and Maths in Tamil, my mother language. I learned<br>
  my trade in English, translated from German. I had no trouble<br>
  learning the gist. If one has to learn the Holy Quran only in<br>
  Arabic, then something has to be wrong with Quran!<br>
  <br>
  Listen my friend, you have challenged Mukto-Mona. I am taking you<br>
  on. I am not banned from computer anymore. I do not know Arabic;But,<br>
  I know Quran translated in English. Let us talk about Quran<br>
  only.Quran was delivered in a way for all the mankind to understand.<br>
  It is for all the mankind, and, I am a human being(My wife does not<br>
  think so, but, that's a different issue!). I am not interested in<br>
  Hadiths or Tasfirs.<br>
  <br>
  I will base my arguments on logic.Every Islamist say that Quran is<br>
  scientific, and, Logic is also a branch of scince.<br>
  <br>
  I am not an acadamic. If you think that I am too low for you to<br>
  debate, then you are lost. That means Quran has lost. Afterall, you<br>
  have to convince an oxymoron like me first before even thinking<br>
  about debating with the likes of Dr.Abul Kasem, Mr.Syed Kamran<br>
  Mirza, Dr.Ali Sina or Mr.Avijit Roy!<br>
  <br>
  Let us have the debate in Mukto-Mona. Since you are way more<br>
  qualified than me, you have to give me time to find suitable<br>
  answeres to refute your arguments.<br>
  <br>
  We have to have a price for this debate. It can not be free. If I<br>
  loose, I will abide to your will, which you must specify before the<br>
  start of the debate. If you fail, you must become an apostate and<br>
  join us, the atheists. Since you initiated the challenge, I am<br>
  setting the price.<br>
  <br>
  If you are too concerned about Arabic, I will request Dr.Ali Sian to<br>
  help me. But,that should not happen, because, if you insist, then,<br>
  Allah becomes the God of the Arabs only; not the Humankind other<br>
  than Arabs!<br>
  <br>
  Kind Regards,<br>
  <br>
  Raman.<br>

  <p>Although Mr. Ahmed has thrown his challenge at Dr. Roy, I am tempted to ask
  him: Has the challenger himself read the Quran in Arabic, and if he has
  understood its archaic Arabic, which even many Arabic speaking people find
  incoherent, nonsensical and inappropriate for their time.</p>
  <p>Secondly, can the challenger explain what has been happening to almost 80%
  of the non-Arabic speaking Muslims of the world? How they have been following
  their Islam, without understanding the true meaning of the Quran they read in
  their mother tongues? Is the challenger suggesting that like Dr. Roy, what all
  the non-Arabic speaking Muslims have been doing in their lives are wrong, and
  that they have been following the Islamic doctrines without really
  understanding them?</p>
  <p>I ask the challenger to answer the above questions before expecting any
  response from Dr. Roy, or others.</p>

  for your interest in our write-ups in the Muktomona site. Your comment: “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">other
  people derivations” </b>is simply ludicrous since we hardly used anything
  but scriptural ideas from Quran and hadiths. If you consider Quran and hadiths
  are <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">other people derivations</b> then
  you are telling us that Quran and Hadiths are not authentic for Islam! You
  also please give us exactly what are the things that should be <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">considered
  Islamic derivations?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></b><o:p>

  the comparison of your own flawed literature collections for your Master
  degree is unheard of. We also did our Masters and Ph.D., for which we had to
  collect hundreds of literature, but we never faced such strange thing like
  getting flawed literature, we never heard such things! Why should some body
  distort or misinterpret somebody else’s research work? What for? I consider
  nobody has any desire or any purpose to distort other people’s research
  work, period. I consider this was your own inability to collect proper and
  needed literature for your thesis.<o:p>

  is preposterous to suggest that we need to learn Arabic to get the real things
  from Quran.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Human being learned
  the past history of many thousands of years from translated books, learned
  science, discovered many civilizations by translating ancient scripts and
  books, but never had any problem of getting the truth of the past history of
  mankind. We never had to learn Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, or Hebrew languages to
  get ancient history. There are at least 20 different translated Koran in
  various languages. We did not find any translated Quran which is 180 degree
  different than the other, nor did we find any gross change/transformation of
  the Arabic texts due to translation. This is a pure lame excuse by you and
  many Islamists. Translation may change the poetry of the texts but never
  change the mathematics. You never can give us an example from the translated
  Quran that—the verse which asks believers to kill the infidels, actually
  asking to kiss the infidels in the Arabic texts of the Quran. Or, could you???<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Another question to you: could you ask Muslims to discard millions of
  Quranic translated copies from the market of the world, since you consider
  them all flawed?<o:p>

  <p>Dear Mr. Husain,</p>
  <p>Unfortunately I did not find anything new in your second message. In this
  mail, you have basically&nbsp; replaced Dr. Ajoy Roy's name&nbsp; with some of
  our Mukto-Mona member's name and the whole text is just a repetition of your
  previous mail. Even in one instance you forgot to change; So Dr. Ajoy K. Roy's
  name is still there. Again,&nbsp; your challenge is not clear. Please
  
  mention clearly what is your challenge, and basically what you are
  looking for from us. If you want to debate on specific, issues, article of any 
  author, please mention it very specifically. Some of our members responded to you regarding your accusation of
  &quot;<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="COLOR: black"><i>180
  degree opposite to the meaning of actual Arabic texts</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Reading Qur'an
  in Arabic</i>&quot; issues.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="color: black">Let me
  know your thought on these issues.</span></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="color: black">I have
  created a separate page regarding your challenge. You can find all messages there on the same
