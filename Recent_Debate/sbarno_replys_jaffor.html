<p>Dear Friends, </p>
<p>I would first like to ask Mr. Jaffor Ullah if the facts of truth brought 
forth by Noam Chomski (link:
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/5283">
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/5283</a> ) are &quot;dishonest&quot;. I'm 
bound to ask this question, because prof. Chomski's &quot;truths&quot; are in sharp 
contrast with prof. Fouad Ajami's &quot;truths&quot;. I urge Mr. Jaffor Ullah to give an 
explanation with his personal judgement. Now let me try to elaborate on why I 
personally think prof. Ajami's viewing of the issue is not straight (I won't 
like to make use of adjectives like honest or dishonest here). I shall like 
anybody and everybody to come forward with the right thing as and when I seem to 
be wrong. But I hope nobody will junk my arguments, drawn typically on the same 
lines as of prof. Chomsky's, simply by calling them of the &quot;communist type&quot;.<br>

  <p><br>
  <span style="background-color: #00FFFF">1.</span> Isn't this a fact that the 
  jewish land is overlapping with the traditonal habitat of a lot of Palestinian 
  Arabs? Well, say in the name of a gesture towards the jews who were 
  ill-treated by the Nazis, let us suppose a chunk of the land has been given to 
  them to make use as their fatherland, as described probably in some holibooks. 
  This is a land where at some point of the past the Jews used to live, but 
  later left behind in search of fortune all over the world. Now they started 
  calling on their brothers all over the world to come back and stay here. Well, 
  that's fine. We have given them a land of their own. But, by what ethical or 
  political logic the Arab (or, Palestinian) inhabitants of that land should 
  have to be evicted, in the name of maintaining the Jewish culture and spirit? 
  That is the main issue. In this sub-continent also, we have created India and 
  Pakistan. But once inside Pakistan, Jinnah declared and proclaimed the land to 
  be equally dear and legitimate for anyone who live inside it. Whether or not 
  Pakistan could maintain it or not is a different issue. The same is true for 
  the Indian constitution. Yes, in spite of that, the exodus happened and people 
  suffered. But we never think of glorifying that exodus even if some of us 
  sometimes support the partition. Why then this same logic should not be 
  applied to the fate of Palestininans who lived in the so called Jewish 
  territory?</p>
  <p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">2.</span> if the world doesn't 
  recognize the Palestine so far as a sovereign state, then against which Israel 
  is fighting a &quot;war&quot;? By what logic Israel's war should NOT be called an 
  occupation?</p>
  <p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">3.</span> If Israel, so far, has 
  all its rigth to retain a military, then why not Palestine too? In the 
  previous camp David effort, the Palestine was being denied that right? It was 
  being made to become a pseudo-state parasitically dependent on Israel. It was 
  supposed to be getting only internal police and no military to fight for its 
  own. WHY? By what definition such a state of Palestine could really be called 
  a state?<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">4.</span> If Arafat is not given 
  the power to fight, why is he, and how is he, caled upon to fight the suicide 
  bombers of Palestine?<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">5.</span> If occupation and 
  neo-imperialism is the cause of suicide bombing, how can it imagined to vanish 
  or subside without the occupation removed?</p>
  <p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">6.</span> The basic question is 
  whether the ocupation is legal or not? If not, why not a sequence like 
  &quot;retreat followed by no violence&quot; instead of the reverse?<br>
  <br>
  <span style="background-color: #00FFFF">7.</span> Why does a truly sovereign 
  Palestinian state pose a threat to Israel's existence and how? And even if it 
  does create a panic in Israeli mind, is that enough justification of keeping 
  Palestinian people under occupation?<br>
  </p>
  <p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">8.</span>If Arafat is a criminal 
  because he cannot reign in the bombers or even because he incites bombing 
  directly or indirectly, why not successive Israeli governments who bomb and 
  kill Palestinians? Is it just because Israel's military is legitimate and 
  Palestine's is an &quot;illegitimate militia&quot;? Does legitimacy connect only to the 
  formal structure of an army and not on how it operates and where it operates?<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">9.</span> Why is it that revolt 
  against occupation cannot involve force and violence if the occupation itself 
  is allowed to occur by force and violence?<br>
  <br>
  <span style="background-color: #00FFFF">10.</span> Why is occupation 
  politically correct, when pertrated with the help of guns, while revolt is 
  not?<br>
  <br>
  <br>

<p>I expect Mr. Jaffor Ullah or anybody else to give direct answers. If Mr. 
Jaffor Ullah has any way for forwarding my questions to prof. Ajami, i shall 
request him to oblige me by doing so.<br>
