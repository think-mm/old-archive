                  <p><b><i>1. Iraq was responsible for the 11 September attacks</i></b></p>
                  <p>A supposed meeting in Prague between Mohammed Atta, leader
                  of the 11 September hijackers, and an Iraqi intelligence
                  official was the main basis for this claim, but Czech
                  intelligence later conceded that the Iraqi's contact could not
                  have been Atta. This did not stop the constant stream of
                  assertions that Iraq was involved in 9/11, which was so
                  successful that at one stage opinion polls showed that
                  two-thirds of Americans believed the hand of Saddam Hussein
                  was behind the attacks. Almost as many believed Iraqi
                  hijackers were aboard the crashed airliners; in fact there
                  were none.</p>
                  <p><i><b>2. Iraq and al-Qa'ida were working together</b></i></p>
                  <p>Persistent claims by US and British leaders that Saddam and
                  Osama bin Laden were in league with each other were
                  contradicted by a leaked British Defense Intelligence Staff
                  report, which said there were no current links between them.
                  Mr Bin Laden's &quot;aims are in ideological conflict with
                  present-day Iraq&quot;, it added.</p>
                  <p>Another strand to the claims was that al-Qa'ida members
                  were being sheltered in Iraq, and had set up a poisons
                  training camp. When US troops reached the camp, they found no
                  chemical or biological traces.</p>
                  <p><i><b>3. Iraq was seeking uranium from Africa for a
                  &quot;reconstituted&quot; nuclear weapons program</b></i></p>
                  <p>The head of the CIA has now admitted that documents
                  purporting to show that Iraq tried to import uranium from
                  Niger in west Africa were forged, and that the claim should
                  never have been in President Bush's State of the Union
                  address. Britain sticks by the claim, insisting it has
                  &quot;separate intelligence&quot;. The Foreign Office conceded
                  last week that this information is now &quot;under
                  review&quot;.</p>
                  <p><i><b>4. Iraq was trying to import aluminum tubes to
                  develop nuclear weapons</b></i></p>
                  <p>The US persistently alleged that Baghdad tried to buy
                  high-strength aluminum tubes whose only use could be in gas
                  centrifuges, needed to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.
                  Equally persistently, the International Atomic Energy Agency
                  said the tubes were being used for artillery rockets. The head
                  of the IAEA, Mohamed El Baradei, told the UN Security Council
                  in January that the tubes were not even suitable for
                  centrifuges.</p>
                  <p><i><b>5. Iraq still had vast stocks of chemical and
                  biological weapons from the first Gulf War</b></i></p>
                  <p>Iraq possessed enough dangerous substances to kill the
                  whole world, it was alleged more than once. It had pilotless
                  aircraft which could be smuggled into the US and used to spray
                  chemical and biological toxins. Experts pointed out that apart
                  from mustard gas, Iraq never had the technology to produce
                  materials with a shelf-life of 12 years, the time between the
                  two wars. All such agents would have deteriorated to the point
                  of uselessness years ago.</p>
                  <p><i><b>6. Iraq retained up to 20 missiles which could carry
                  chemical or biological warheads, with a range which would
                  threaten British forces in Cyprus</b></i></p>
                  <p>Apart from the fact that there has been no sign of these
                  missiles since the invasion, Britain downplayed the risk of
                  there being any such weapons in Iraq once the fighting began.
                  It was also revealed that chemical protection equipment was
                  removed from British bases in Cyprus last year, indicating
                  that the Government did not take its own claims seriously.</p>
                  <p><i><b>7. Saddam Hussein had the wherewithal to develop
                  smallpox</b></i></p>
                  <p>This allegation was made by the Secretary of State, Colin
                  Powell, in his address to the UN Security Council in February.
                  The following month the UN said there was nothing to support
                  it.</p>
                  <p><i><b>8. US and British claims were supported by the
                  inspectors</b></i></p>
                  <p>According to Jack Straw, chief UN weapons inspector Hans
                  Blix &quot;pointed out&quot; that Iraq had 10,000 liters of
                  anthrax. Tony Blair said Iraq's chemical, biological and
                  &quot;indeed the nuclear weapons program&quot; had been well
                  documented by the UN. Mr Blix's reply? &quot;This is not the
                  same as saying there are weapons of mass destruction,&quot; he
                  said last September. &quot;If I had solid evidence that Iraq
                  retained weapons of mass destruction or were constructing such
                  weapons, I would take it to the Security Council.&quot; In May
                  this year he added: &quot;I am obviously very interested in
                  the question of whether or not there were weapons of mass
                  destruction, and I am beginning to suspect there possibly were
                  not.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i><b>9. Previous weapons inspections had failed</b></i></p>
                  <p>Tony Blair told this newspaper in March that the UN had
                  &quot;tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to get Saddam to
                  disarm peacefully&quot;. But in 1999 a Security Council panel
                  concluded: &quot;Although important elements still have to be
                  resolved, the bulk of Iraq's proscribed weapons programs has
                  been eliminated.&quot; Mr Blair also claimed UN inspectors
                  &quot;found no trace at all of Saddam's offensive biological
                  weapons program&quot; until his son-in-law defected. In fact
                  the UN got the regime to admit to its biological weapons
                  program more than a month before the defection.</p>
                  <p><i><b>10. Iraq was obstructing the inspectors</b></i></p>
                  <p>Britain's February &quot;dodgy dossier&quot; claimed
                  inspectors' escorts were &quot;trained to start long
                  arguments&quot; with other Iraqi officials while evidence was
                  being hidden, and inspectors' journeys were monitored and
                  notified ahead to remove surprise. Dr Blix said in February
                  that the UN had conducted more than 400 inspections, all
                  without notice, covering more than 300 sites. &quot;We note
                  that access to sites has so far been without problems,&quot;
                  he said. : &quot;In no case have we seen convincing evidence
                  that the Iraqi side knew that the inspectors were
                  coming.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i><b>11. Iraq could deploy its weapons of mass destruction
                  in 45 minutes</b></i></p>
                  <p>This now-notorious claim was based on a single source, said
                  to be a serving Iraqi military officer. This individual has
                  not been produced since the war, but in any case Tony Blair
                  contradicted the claim in April. He said Iraq had begun to
                  conceal its weapons in May 2002, which meant that they could
                  not have been used within 45 minutes.</p>
                  <p><i><b>12. The &quot;dodgy dossier&quot;</b></i></p>
                  <p>Mr Blair told the Commons in February, when the dossier was
                  issued: &quot;We issued further intelligence over the weekend
                  about the infrastructure of concealment. It is obviously
                  difficult when we publish intelligence reports.&quot; It soon
                  emerged that most of it was cribbed without attribution from
                  three articles on the internet. Last month Alastair Campbell
                  took responsibility for the plagiarism committed by his staff,
                  but stood by the dossier's accuracy, even though it confused
                  two Iraqi intelligence organizations, and said one moved to
                  new headquarters in 1990, two years before it was created.</p>
                  <p><i><b>13. War would be easy</b></i></p>
                  <p>Public fears of war in the US and Britain were assuaged by
                  assurances that oppressed Iraqis would welcome the invading
                  forces; that &quot;demolishing Saddam Hussein's military power
                  and liberating Iraq would be a cakewalk&quot;, in the words of
                  Kenneth Adelman, a senior Pentagon official in two previous
                  Republican administrations. Resistance was patchy, but stiffer
                  than expected, mainly from irregular forces fighting in
                  civilian clothes. &quot;This wasn't the enemy we war-gamed
                  against,&quot; one general complained.</p>
                  <p><i><b>14. Umm Qasr</b></i></p>
                  <p>The fall of Iraq's southernmost city and only port was
                  announced several times before Anglo-American forces gained
                  full control - by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, among
                  others, and by Admiral Michael Boyce, chief of Britain's
                  Defense staff. &quot;Umm Qasr has been overwhelmed by the US
                  Marines and is now in coalition hands,&quot; the Admiral
                  announced, somewhat prematurely.</p>
                  <p><i><b>15. Basra rebellion</b></i></p>
                  <p>Claims that the Shia Muslim population of Basra, Iraq's
                  second city, had risen against their oppressors were repeated
                  for days, long after it became clear to those there that this
                  was little more than wishful thinking. The defeat of a
                  supposed breakout by Iraqi armour was also announced by
                  military spokesman in no position to know the truth.</p>
                  <p><i><b>16. The &quot;rescue&quot; of Private Jessica Lynch</b></i></p>
                  <p>Private Jessica Lynch's &quot;rescue&quot; from a hospital
                  in Nasiriya by American special forces was presented as the
                  major &quot;feel-good&quot; story of the war. She was said to
                  have fired back at Iraqi troops until her ammunition ran out,
                  and was taken to hospital suffering bullet and stab wounds. It
                  has since emerged that all her injuries were sustained in a
                  vehicle crash, which left her incapable of firing any shot.
                  Local medical staff had tried to return her to the Americans
                  after Iraqi forces pulled out of the hospital, but the doctors
                  had to turn back when US troops opened fire on them. The
                  special forces encountered no resistance, but made sure the
                  whole episode was filmed.</p>
                  <p><i><b>17. Troops would face chemical and biological weapons</b></i></p>
                  <p>As US forces approached Baghdad, there was a rash of
                  reports that they would cross a &quot;red line&quot;, within
                  which Republican Guard units were authorized to use chemical
                  weapons. But Lieutenant General James Conway, the leading US
                  marine general in Iraq, conceded afterwards that intelligence
                  reports that chemical weapons had been deployed around Baghdad
                  before the war were wrong.</p>
                  <p>&quot;It was a surprise to me ... that we have not
                  uncovered weapons ... in some of the forward dispersal
                  sites,&quot; he said. &quot;We've been to virtually every
                  ammunition supply point between the Kuwaiti border and
                  Baghdad, but they're simply not there. We were simply wrong.
                  Whether or not we're wrong at the national level, I think
                  still very much remains to be seen.&quot;</p>
                  <p><i><b>18. Interrogation of scientists would yield the
                  location of WMD</b></i></p>
                  <p>&quot;I have got absolutely no doubt that those weapons are
                  there ... once we have the co-operation of the scientists and
                  the experts, I have got no doubt that we will find them,&quot;
                  Tony Blair said in April. Numerous similar assurances were
                  issued by other leading figures, who said interrogations would
                  provide the WMD discoveries that searches had failed to
                  supply. But almost all Iraq's leading scientists are in
                  custody, and claims that lingering fears of Saddam Hussein are
                  stilling their tongues are beginning to wear thin.</p>
                  <p><i><b>19. Iraq's oil money would go to Iraqis</b></i></p>
                  <p>Tony Blair complained in Parliament that &quot;people
                  falsely claim that we want to seize&quot; Iraq's oil revenues,
                  adding that they should be put in a trust fund for the Iraqi
                  people administered through the UN. Britain should seek a
                  Security Council resolution that would affirm &quot;the use of
                  all oil revenues for the benefit of the Iraqi people&quot;.</p>
                  <p>Instead Britain co-sponsored a Security Council resolution
                  that gave the US and UK control over Iraq's oil revenues.
                  There is no UN-administered trust fund.</p>
                  <p>Far from &quot;all oil revenues&quot; being used for the
                  Iraqi people, the resolution continues to make deductions from
                  Iraq's oil earnings to pay in compensation for the invasion of
                  Kuwait in 1990.</p>
                  <p><i><b>20. WMD were found</b></i></p>
                  <p>After repeated false sightings, both Tony Blair and George
                  Bush proclaimed on 30 May that two trailers found in Iraq were
                  mobile biological laboratories. &quot;We have already found
                  two trailers, both of which we believe were used for the
                  production of biological weapons,&quot; said Mr Blair. Mr Bush
                  went further: &quot;Those who say we haven't found the banned
                  manufacturing devices or banned weapons - they're wrong. We
                  found them.&quot; It is now almost certain that the vehicles
                  were for the production of hydrogen for weather balloons, just
                  as the Iraqis claimed - and that they were exported by
                  Britain.</p>
