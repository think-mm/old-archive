	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">JUST before he became pope, Cardinal 
	Joseph Ratzinger warned that Western culture was sliding toward &quot;a 
	dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as for certain 
	and which has as its highest goal one's own ego and one's own desires.&quot; In 
	his first encyclical, &quot;Deus Caritas Est&quot; (&quot;God Is Love&quot;), Pope Benedict XVI 
	does not use the word &quot;relativism,&quot; but he does fault modern people for 
	missing the transcendent meaning of love and instead caring for one another 
	just because we feel like it. <br>
	Is that relativism, and if so, is it wrong? Some varieties of relativism may 
	be confused, or even pernicious. But others are essential to any serious, 
	well-developed worldview — even the pope's.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Pope Benedict's worry is that individual autonomy has been elevated above 
	moral absolutes. But ethicists have long distinguished between what they 
	call defeasible and indefeasible moral claims. Defeasible claims are rules 
	of thumb that nevertheless can be overruled for countervailing moral 
	reasons. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Surely many moral duties are defeasible, and in that sense relative. We all 
	recognize that although lying is typically wrong, under certain 
	circumstances — to protect someone's life, for example — it is justifiable. 
	Yet the fact that one moral claim can sometimes give way for another does 
	not mean that the first claim is groundless, any more than traffic laws are 
	invalidated because ambulances can run red lights. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	This is a point the pope can appreciate. In November, he barred those who 
	&quot;practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies, or 
	support the so-called gay culture&quot; from entering the seminary or being 
	ordained. At the same time, the Vatican directive enjoined respect for gays 
	and left open to interpretation the distinction between &quot;deep-seated&quot; and 
	&quot;transitory&quot; tendencies, which has led some to speculate that it would 
	permit the ordination of a sexually mature, celibate homosexual.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Most significantly, it does nothing about current gay priests. If 
	homosexuality is, as the church's catechism holds, &quot;objectively disordered,&quot; 
	why not an outright ban? One reason might be the priest shortage in America. 
	An objectively disordered priesthood is better than none. Non-absolute 
	standards, anyone?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	The pope has used the term &quot;relativism&quot; to describe not only non-absolute 
	standards, but also uncertain ones. The alternative to certainty, however, 
	is not nihilism but the recognition of fallibility, the idea that even a 
	very reasonable belief is not beyond question. If that's all relativism 
	means, then it is hardly the enemy of truth or morality. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Accepting that we are fallible doesn't keep us from thinking that we're 
	right. It just keeps us from thinking that we couldn't possibly be wrong. 
	And that's a good thing. The ability to revise beliefs in light of new 
	information is part of what makes having a mind worthwhile. It worked for a 
	young German theologian who (according to his biographer, John Allen) in the 
	late 1960's began a transformation from Vatican II reformer to enforcer of 
	the faith. Even the church itself has been known to self-correct every once 
	in a while (see Galileo and Darwin).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	What Pope Benedict calls relativism are actually the values of secular 
	liberalism: individual autonomy, equal rights and freedom of conscience. But 
	it is easy to conflate what liberals affirm with the way they affirm it. 
	Liberalism tells us that our way of life is up to us (within limits), not 
	that the truth of liberalism is up to us. It entails that we tolerate even 
	claims that we doubt, not that we doubt even the claims of tolerance. Many 
	liberals themselves are guilty of this confusion, which can manifest as 
	all-values-are-equal relativism (especially common among freshmen in ethics 
	classes, at least until the instructor informs them that because all grades 
	are equally valid, everyone will be receiving a D for the course).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	True, secular values can turn a civilization inside out. In post-Christian 
	Europe, entire nations have been plunged into endemic health, skyrocketing 
	education and hopelessly low rates of violent crime. Indeed, it's hard to 
	build a decent society without secular values, and &quot;Deus Caritas Est&quot; 
	acknowledges this: &quot;A just society must be the achievement of politics, not 
	of the church,&quot; where politics is &quot;the sphere of the autonomous use of 
	reason.&quot; The role of the church is to &quot;bring about openness of mind and will 
	to the demands of the common good,&quot; not to &quot;impose on those who do not share 
	the faith ways of thinking and modes of conduct proper to faith.&quot;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Perhaps a future encyclical will concentrate on the truly harmful kind of 
	relativism. This is the misguided multiculturalism that keeps Western 
	liberals from criticizing the oppression of women, religious minorities and 
	apostates in Islamic societies for fear of being accused of Islamophobia. In 
	such cases we should not shrink from the ideals of autonomy and equality but 
	affirm them openly for what they are: objectively defensible principles of 
	conscience. <br>
	The important contrast is not between absolutism and relativism, as the 
	pontiff would have it, but between secular values and their traditional 
	religious alternatives. He can accuse secularists of believing in the wrong 
	things. But that's not the same as believing in nothing.</font></p>
