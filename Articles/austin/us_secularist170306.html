	<font face="Verdana">On my second day in Bangladesh, I was being driven 
	through the rice fields and banana groves outside of Keshabpur when our car 
	passed some graffiti on a wall in a small village. My guide, Shahriar Kabir, 
	explained that it was an Islamist slogan proclaiming that the Koran holds 
	the solution to every problem. We were on our way to address a gathering of 
	citizens who are fighting the rising tide of fundamentalism in Bangladesh. 
	Just before we arrived, we passed on long line outside a fertilizer shop. 
	The country was in the midst of severe shortages of fertilizer, water, and 
	electricity. Yet despite the hopes of the Islamist sloganeer, average 
	Bengalis were not trying to squeeze rice or water out of the Koran. They 
	knew to bring their problems to the government and to leave their souls to 
	religion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The response of the government, 
	however, provided only comic relief, as the prime minister denied the 
	existence of the shortages in an address to parliament. Later that day, 
	February 28, in the middle of my speech to a group of journalists and 
	community leaders in Khulna, the lights went out. Indeed, these are dark 
	times for secular democracy in Bangladesh. With nearly 100 known militant 
	organizations and perhaps as many as 64,000 Wahibist madrassas (only 20 
	percent are overseen by the government), for the last 20 years the country 
	has been undergoing Talibanization. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The previous day, in a meeting at 
	the Bangladesh Institute of Law and International Affairs in Dhaka, I had 
	appeared alongside Kabir, Professor Ajoy Roy, Professor Kabir Chowdhury, Dr. 
	Hamida Hussain, Justice K.M. Sobhan and Ambassador Waliur Rahman. Ambassador 
	Rahman, the author of one of the amendments to the constitution, read aloud 
	from his personal copy of the original 1972 version -- which he described as 
	poetry -- and said it brought tears to his eyes when he thought of what had 
	become of it. As an American, I praised the 1972 founding document as even 
	more secular than our own. While the US Constitution made no mention of God 
	and forbade establishment of a state religion, the Bangladeshi Constitution 
	went further to expressly ban religion-based parties. The recent history of 
	the Jamaat-e-Islami party makes all too clear the wisdom of this provision. 
	The secular heritage of Bangladesh makes all the more heinous the campaign 
	by a militant minority to turn the country into a theocracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The title of the meeting in Dhaka 
	was &quot;A call for global unity of secular humanists to resist fundamentalism.&quot; 
	I had come to deliver a message from secularists in the US and everywhere, 
	that the plight of Bangladesh would not go unnoticed. There is a worldwide 
	of network of people who are committed to the freedom of conscience and the 
	separation of religion from government, and who stand in solidarity with 
	Bangladeshis against theocracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This network has proven its 
	effectiveness in the past. In August 2001, Dr. Younis Shaikh, an instructor 
	at a medical collage in Islamabad, was convicted under Pakistan's blasphemy 
	laws and sentenced to death. Dr. Shaikh was known in international humanist 
	circles as the leader of a Pakistan-based organization called 
	&quot;Enlightenment,&quot; a member of the International Humanist and Ethical Union, 
	an umbrella organization comprising nearly 100 groups around the world. Upon 
	his arrest, the International Humanist and Ethical Union initiated a 
	campaign that eventually saved him from execution. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My organization, Center for 
	Inquiry-Transnational, had sent me to South Asia to attend the inauguration 
	of the Center's new branch in Hyderabad and to establish contacts in 
	Bangladesh. For the last twenty-five years, the Center for Inquiry has been 
	a leading advocate for scientific reason, freedom of inquiry, and secular 
	values in public affairs, with its magazines Free Inquiry and Skeptical 
	Inquirer read around the world. An early critic of contemporary Islamic 
	fundamentalism, the Center has brought together activists and intellectuals 
	from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, Russia, Europe, the 
	United States, and elsewhere. The black rivers of oil that flow from the 
	Gulf states and turn to poison in the ears of young Bengali madrassa 
	students do not observe national borders. So too must secular ideals cross 
	national, religious, and ethnic boundaries to resist intolerance wherever it 
	appears. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question I was asked most often 
	was why the US persists in regarding Bangladesh as a &quot;moderate&quot; Muslim 
	government, in the words -- now infamous among liberal-minded Bangladeshis 
	-- used by State Department official Christina Rocca. No doubt some in the 
	Bush administration were moved by the short-term strategic interest in being 
	able to claim at least one member of the Organization of Islamic Countries 
	as a backer of the war in Iraq. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I also couldn't help but wonder 
	whether America's own ambivalence about secularism at home is confounding 
	its relationship with secularists abroad. Thanks in part to the propaganda 
	of the Christian Right, secularism has become a dirty word in America, 
	conjuring up godlessness and amorality. As the journalist-historian Susan 
	Jacoby showed in her recent book, &quot;Freethinkers: A History of American 
	Secularism,&quot; religious conservatives have constructed a revisionist history 
	of &quot;Christian America&quot; that excludes the tradition of people like the 
	founding father Thomas Paine, the celebrated 19th century orator Robert G. 
	Ingersoll, the feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and the civil rights 
	activist A. Philip Randolph, all of whom reached outside of traditional 
	Christianity for sources of American democratic values. Today, it would be 
	political suicide for an elected official to self-describe as a secularist. 
	It is in the context of this political culture that we have to view the US 
	failure to push for strictly non-religious governments in Afghanistan and 
	Iraq. Could it be that like so many of our problems, America's religion 
	problems are being outsourced? </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While the US government is often no 
	friend to secular democracy around the world, I believe the American people 
	are and will be friends to the Bengali people, as they demonstrated in 1971. 
	As the Islamists' power swells, it is now more important than ever for 
	Americans to support the resistance in Bangladesh. This is not only a 
	prudent step to avoiding a new generation of terrorists, but also a 
	recognition of common moral principles. For while secular government may 
	have come first to North America, secular values of pluralism and toleration 
	go much further back in South Asia, from the world's most venerable 
	materialistic philosophical tradition, to the liberalism of the Shah kings, 
	and the humanism of Persian literature and music. Thomas Jefferson could 
	have learned a lot about secular democracy from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Back at the press club in Khulna, on 
	the eve of the 35th anniversary of the liberation war, I was listening to 
	former freedom fighters who were prepared to lay down their lives for 
	secular democracy. I'll never forget how after the lights went out, we were 
	led down the darkened stairs and outside by a young organizer with a single 
	candle. If the great promise of America's ideals is to be fulfilled, 
	Americans must walk with the Bengali people as they take their proud country 
	towards a bright, secular future. </font></p>
