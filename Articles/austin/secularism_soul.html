  <span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a recent survey by 
  the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, a majority of Americans believe it 
  is appropriate in general for public officials to rely on their faith when 
  thinking about policy decisions. President Bush in particular wins public 
  approval for consulting his conscience. Yet, curiously, the data also suggests 
  that when confronted with actual religious statements by politicians, many 
  Americans feel uncomfortable. What could this mean? Do we like deeply held 
  beliefs so long as they carry no political implications? (If so, how deep 
  could they be?) Or do we prefer deeply held beliefs whose political 
  implications we dissimulate in public? (Hardly a basis for public dialogue in 
  a democracy.)</span></p>

  <span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to secularism in America, 
  where this strange tension in attitudes about religion and politics is not 
  just a statistical oddity; it’s a public philosophy. Secularism per se is not 
  to blame. America’s strict separation of religion and state and freedom of 
  conscience remain among its greatest achievements—and its most precious 
  ideological exports. Rather, the confusion stems from a particular 
  interpretation of secularism, now the dominant view, which equates it with the 
  idea that conscience is a “private matter.”</span></p>

text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Schools and utilities 
  markets may be another matter, but when it comes to religion, liberal-minded 
  folks have embraced privatization with fervor. Their mantra: beliefs are fine 
  in private, so long as you don’t “impose” them on others. Prayer is vertical; 
  piety is personal. Indeed, Cornell </span>
  <span style="font-family:
  Verdana">University</span><span style="font-family:
Verdana"> historians Isaac Kramnick and Lawrence Moore, authors of <i>The 
  Godless Constitution</i>, link the rise of Western liberalism to the 
  privatization of religion: its “removal from the public realm, and its 
  transfer to the private world of individual freedom of conscience, belief, and 
  practice.” In political theory, the privacy argument can be traced at least to 
  the beginning of an intellectual era inaugurated by the late John Rawls in 
  1971. His monumental <i>Theory of Justice</i> articulated the view, which had 
  been emerging in American jurisprudence since the 1940s, that the state is to 
  remain “neutral” on all contested moral and religious claims, or “conceptions 
  of the good life” as they came to be known. Rawls’ equally influential <i>
  Political Liberalism </i>went further, defending an “ideal of public reason” 
  according to which public discourse about fundamental political questions 
  should appeal only to beliefs and values that are acceptable to all reasonable 
  citizens. “Private reasons” have no place in politics.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana">Unfortunately, the privacy model is almost 
  entirely misleading. What’s more, staunch secularists should be the first to 
  give it up. The last three years have witnessed an eruption of issues that 
  intersect with religion, ranging from sodomy laws, gay marriage, HIV-AIDS and 
  stem cell research, global family planning, and abortion to relations between 
  the U.S. and Islamic societies and the future of Iraqi democracy. In almost 
  every case, the privacy model confounds liberals’ own best efforts to critique 
  the cultural influence of theological conservatism. “Privacy” gets conflated 
  with subjectivity, and subjectivity implies immunity to criticism. If, as the 
  old joke goes, a liberal is one who won’t take his or her own side in an 
  argument, today’s secularists are those who can’t.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana">More fundamentally, the privacy model severs 
  secularism from theology. This is a recipe for incoherence, for the question 
  of the proper relation between religion and politics is as much religious as 
  it is politico-philosophical. That is nowhere clearer than in the democratic 
  stirrings in Iraq, which offer an illuminating mirror on our own secular 
  founding. The call for separation of mosque and state is dead unless it can be 
  made at Friday prayers. Even America, it turns out, could never have escaped 
  theocracy if our church-state fathers had believed that religious claims are 
  “private reasons.” John Locke, Roger Williams, and James Madison were not just 
  the public philosophers of secularism; they were also its theologians, who 
  believed in the accountability of conscience. Their successors would do well 
  to do likewise. This is not only a matter of simple intellectual clarity and 
  honesty. It is also the only way to do justice to the significance of 
  conscience and its proper place in the public discourse of a pluralistic 
  society.</span></p>

  <span style="font-family:Verdana">At William Pryer’s confirmation hearings in 
  July 2003, one would have been hard-pressed to discern that the confirmation 
  in question was a federal judicial appointment, not the Catholic sacrament. 
  When Democrats pressed Pryer on his conservative record, his Republican allies 
  accused them of anti-Catholic bias. The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director 
  of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, spoke for 
  privacy-secularists when he responded, “[c]oncern about Pryor’s nomination 
  focuses on his extreme legal agenda, not his personal religious beliefs.” Yet 
  on closer inspection this distinction appears artificial. Isn’t it plain that 
  the committee members were in fact concerned, among other things, about 
  Pryor’s religious beliefs? After all, here was a man who declared before a Ten 
  Commandments rally in </span><span style="font-family:
  Verdana">Montgomery</span><span style="font-family:
Verdana"> that “God has chosen, through his son Jesus Christ, this time, this 
  place for all Christians—Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox—to save our 
  country and save our courts.” Pryer’s opponents were wondering about the ways 
  in which beliefs like this might or might not affect the nominee’s actions as 
  a federal judge. Unfortunately, the doctrine of privacy collapses the logical 
  space between personal attack and good-faith inquiry, thereby fueling the 
  charge of bigotry.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">A key meaning of “private” 
  is “personal,” as in intimate matters to which access by others without one’s 
  consent may justifiably be denied. The notion is familiar in the idea of a 
  domestic sphere. A family meal at home is private because the family may 
  appropriately deny others participation in the meal or even information about 
  it without their consent. Most ethicists point out that private affairs have 
  moral importance not just because they give people power over each other, for 
  well or for woe (witness blackmail and or identity theft). The additional 
  moral value, they argue, is persons’ autonomy, or self-direction and 
  self-determination. By invading someone’s privacy we fail to respect, or we 
  diminish, that person’s autonomy. The ethical analysis accords with common 
  sense. It seems prima facie out of bounds to drag someone’s personal life in 
  public view. If religion is private (personal), then it falls into this same 
  sensitive sphere. As one American jurist wrote, “we of this country made it an 
  article of organic law that the relations between man and his Maker were a 
  private concern, into which other men have no right to intrude.”</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Obviously, in a free society 
  everyone has a right to access information <i>about religion</i>, as anyone at 
  your local library or The History Channel can tell you. So, that can’t be what 
  people mean by the privacy of religion. Perhaps what they mean is that you 
  can’t bring information about <i>my religiosity</i> into view without my 
  consent. But suppose I put it there in the first place. When President Bush 
  tells <i>Ladies Home Journal </i>that he takes great comfort from reading 
  Charles Stanley devotionals every morning, he has effectively invited the 
  public in for a look around the interior of his worldview. When the Pope urges 
  the world to seek peace, he can hardly accuse anyone of intruding on his<i>
  </i>private thoughts. Whenever citizens or politicians voluntarily present 
  their religious beliefs in politics, it makes no sense for secularists to 
  object on grounds of personal autonomy.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Even when it is motivated by 
  a spirit of toleration, the idea that conscience is personal can actually 
  hinder the possibility of respectful critical dialogue on religiously-charged 
  political issues. For if religion is merely personal, questioning a person’s 
  beliefs is questioning a person’s character. Thus, when <i>Newsweek </i>
  undertook to scrutinize Bush’s fundamentalist religion, it ended up slamming 
  his character. Religion scholar Martin Marty accused of Bush of arrogance for 
  thinking that he is doing God’s will. It may be easier for secularists to 
  label infallibilism a personality flaw rather than a flawed theology, but it 
  is certainly no more respectful or helpful. The notion that critical inquiry 
  about one’s religious beliefs is tantamount to bigotry could appeal only to 
  adherents of the most extreme form of identity politics. Or Rick Santorum. In 
  a letter to the <i>New York Times</i>, the chairman of the Senate Republican 
  Conference condemned the judicial committee’s treatment of Pryer by describing 
  any such questions regarding “deeply held beliefs inspired by religious 
  convictions” as “dangerous.” Were they to consistently apply their privacy 
  model of conscience, secularists would be forced to agree.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;When the Vatican finally spoke out against 
  violence against children (by which it meant gay adoption), secularists were 
  outraged. While a few actually came out and disagreed with Rome’s claim that 
  same-sex marriage constitutes the “legalization of evil,” most objected along 
  the same lines as editors of <i>The Boston Globe</i>, who opined, “[t]he 
  greatness of America is its pluralism, and neither president nor pope can 
  impose his religious beliefs on the public realm.” In so doing, they were 
  relying on yet another meaning of “privacy” in the slogan, “religion is 
  private matter”: Beliefs are private in the sense of sectarian, or not 
  endorsed by all.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">The appeal of this meaning 
  of privacy is not hard to appreciate. One important part (although not the 
  only part) of politics is the public discussion and justification of decisions 
  about what governments should do. In such discussions, citizens and officials 
  often present each other with reasons in support of this or that political 
  decision. But in a society characterized by a multiplicity of contested 
  religious, moral, and philosophical positions, the reasons that are endorsed 
  by one person or community may not be endorsed by another. Beginning in the 
  1990s, many political theorists followed Rawls in arguing that discourse in a 
  pluralistic society ought to be guided by an ideal of “public reason”: 
  participants may introduce only shared reasons, those that can be endorsed by 
  all citizens (or at least all “reasonable” citizens). In a deeply diverse 
  society, citizens must set aside their “private” convictions when seeking a 
  secure grounding for the political order.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:normal"><span style="font-family: Verdana">However, most experts 
  have since come to reject the Rawlsian ideal of public reason. First, as a 
  number of commentators have observed, it would unduly restrict the liberty of 
  religious citizens by requiring them to refrain from acting on their beliefs 
  in public. Freedom of conscience means nothing if it does not include the 
  freedom to speak and act socially and politically as conscience compels, even 
  when its conclusions are not universally shared. Second, the strictures of 
  public reason would cut against the nonreligious as well. A filter fine enough 
  to keep religious ideals and values out of political debate is likely also to 
  keep out fundamental <i>moral </i>convictions, such as the ideals of freedom, 
  fairness, or benevolence. Matters of morality, as much as matters of faith, 
  are subject to disagreements among sincere and sensible people. There is 
  therefore no rationale for singling out one but not the other for political 
  exile. Yet to exile both would leave citizens with next to nothing to discuss 
  with. Some would reply that religious differences should be singled out 
  because they are inevitably more divisive than differences of other kinds. But 
  that reply is without no empirical support. The bitter disputes surrounding 
  race relations, the environment, tax policy, or the war on terrorism, for 
  example are not theological in nature, but ethical, social, and factual. We 
  are left with the unacceptable choice between arbitrarily precluding religious 
  reasons only, or evacuating politics of all substantive normative and 
  philosophical disagreement. Something must be amiss with the political 
  philosophy that drives us to this dilemma.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 0in; line-height: normal">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">In a series of provocative articles, <i>New 
  York Times</i> columnist Nicholas Kristof has drawn elites’ attention to the 
  continuing influence of evangelical Christians in American and their growing 
  alienation from intellectual and scientific culture, popularizing the alarming 
  statistic that more Americans believe in the Devil than in evolution. However, 
  it is not always clear what he is worried about. He says, “I tend to disagree 
  with evangelicals on almost everything, and I see no problem with aggressively 
  pointing out the dismal consequences of this increasing religious influence. 
  For example, evangelicals’ discomfort with condoms and sex education has led 
  the administration to policies that are likely to lead to more people dying of 
  AIDS at home and abroad, not to mention more pregnancies and abortions.” Then 
  he goes on to chastise fellow secularists: “liberal critiques sometimes seem 
  not just filled with outrage at evangelical-backed policies, which is fair, 
  but also to have a sneering tone about conservative Christianity itself. Such 
  mockery of religious faith is inexcusable.”</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana">It seems we are being asked to object to the 
  “consequences” of conservative religion without objecting to the moral 
  precepts behind them, as though we could endorse the soundness of a norm while 
  renouncing the behavior it sanctions. What could be more appropriate than to 
  evaluate a system of beliefs on the basis of its consequences for individual 
  and social behavior? If causing more people to die pointlessly is not an 
  objection to a system of beliefs, I don’t know what would be. Once again, the 
  privacy model proves self-undermining to secularists’ aims. They must resort 
  to cognitive contortions in order to criticize another’s religion without 
  seeming critical of religion. Why? At the root of Kristof’s quandary we find 
  what is perhaps the deepest, and misleading, sense of “private”: the private 
  as the subjective, that which defies interpersonal examination and evaluation. 
  The <i>consequences </i>of conscience may belong to the public, empirical, 
  objective world we all share, but conscience “itself” lies in the realm of the 
  private, the mysterious, and subjective. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">The philosopher Thomas Nagel 
  once argued that the reasons we give for political decisions must make sense 
  to our fellow community members, because government actions have a direct 
  impact on their lives and behavior. Therefore, our reasons must meet a certain 
  standard of “higher-order impartiality” or objectivity. One must be prepared 
  “to submit one’s reasons to the criticism of others, and to find that the 
  exercise of a common critical rationality and consideration of evidence that 
  can be shared will reveal that one is mistaken.” The standard of impartiality 
  is not met, Nagel claimed, when “part of the source of your conviction is 
  personal faith or revelation . . . .” When political reasons fail to achieve 
  higher-order impartiality, political debate amounts to a mere “clash between 
  irreconcilable subjective convictions” rather than a disagreement in “the 
  common, public domain.”</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Nagel has an important 
  point, here, but it must not be overstated (as Nagel himself later conceded). 
  Leave aside the fact that many religious contributions to politics (for 
  example, nature law ethics) are thought to be based not in raw revelation but 
  in evidential considerations open to all. Just because you do not or could not 
  share a conviction does not mean that it is beyond your comprehension and 
  critical evaluation. My irrational fear of clowns (rooted in a childhood 
  experience, let’s say) can be intelligible and open to critical evaluation by 
  you, even though you lack it and the experience that produced it. The fact 
  that a belief originates in intuition or revelation does nothing whatever to 
  inoculate it against interpersonal criticism—remember Jim Jones, Heaven’s 
  Gate, and the Branch Davidians.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">So long as the reasons we 
  introduce into public discourse—religious reasons included—are regarded by all 
  as subject to public scrutiny, then Nagel’s concerns can be met. Ideally, 
  conversation in politics abides by the norms of all reasoned conversation: 
  civility, mutual respect, rationality, and consistency. If we are unwilling to 
  present others with reasons for what we say that are open to analysis by them, 
  then we are engaging in monologue, not dialogue. A serious, good-faith 
  religious proposal should be held to the same standards—like feasibility, 
  constitutionality, morality, or popular support—as any other proposal. 
  Susceptibility to criticism is the price of admission to public discourse. Of 
  course, it is a price that religious believers should be willing to pay, for 
  if their beliefs cannot be false or pernicious, then neither can they be true 
  or good. Call this the <i>accountability of conscience</i>.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">The stem cell debate has 
  provided good examples of the accountability of conscience. Ron Reagan, Jr., 
  in a letter to the New York Times on August 12, 2004 wrote: “Those opposed to 
  embryonic stem cell research are entitled to their beliefs. But those making a 
  moral argument are obliged to be morally consistent. If destroying even an 
  artificially created “embryo” in a petri dish is equivalent to murder, then I 
  would expect the White House to campaign vigorously against in vitro 
  fertilization clinics that routinely dispose of unused early-stage embryos by 
  the thousands.”</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Some believers unwittingly 
  adopt the subjectivism of the privacy paradigm. Patrick Scully, a spokesman 
  for the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Liberties, recently defended 
  Bush’s White House prayer sessions by analogizing Jesus-worshippers and sports 
  enthusiasts: “If they were . . . Baltimore Orioles fans,” he told ABC News, 
  “they would be able to talk about that without anybody freaking out.” God as 
  team—I root for mine, you root for yours. As Yale law professor Stephen L. 
  Carter observed in <i>The Culture of Disbelief</i>, this is a trivialization 
  of religion, the view that “religion is like building model airplanes, just 
  another hobby: something quiet, something private, something trivial—and not 
  really a fit activity for intelligent, public-spirited adults.” But if privacy 
  as subjectivity is an enemy of the faith, it is ironically no friend of 
  secularism either. If secularism is to fulfill its historical role as a check 
  on the social influence of illiberal creeds, it must exchange privacy for the 
  accountability<i> </i>of conscience.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana">America’s church-state fathers would not 
  recognize themselves in the secularists of today. They never maintained that 
  political discourse must be “neutral” on spiritual questions. In fact, their 
  flagship arguments for disestablishment were overtly theological. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">Roger Williams’ Rhode Island was perhaps 
  the most secular government that the world had ever seen. And yet the radical 
  Puritan separatist based his political philosophy in Biblical theology. 
  Williams inferred from scriptural-historical evidence that no actual nations 
  since Israel have possessed its special status as God’s nation. Since God no 
  longer makes direct covenants with nations, no government has the right to 
  represent itself as bearing the imprimatur of the divine.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">In formulating his 
  secularism, James Madison’s chief interlocutor was Patrick Henry, whose 
  proposed Virginia tax to support religious education provoked Madison’s 
  definitive <i>Memorial and Remonstrance</i> in 1785. Henry stood by the 
  ever-popular hypothesis that civil order cannot survive without a religious 
  populace (as evidenced by the lawless Denmark and Norway). Madision didn’t 
  challenge the hypothesis directly, instead taking issue with the assumption 
  that government is the best instrument for inculcating public religiosity. The 
  debate largely came down to the proper way to promote piety—a “private matter” 
  if ever there was one.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Madison’s basic premise was 
  the <i>voluntariness</i> of genuine belief. He thought state promotion of 
  piety is self-defeating because it operates by coercion, while authentic 
  belief must spring from free choice. This argument had been popularized by 
  dissident English Protestants such as Leonard Busher who in 1612 wrote: “as 
  kings and bishops cannot command the wind, so they cannot command faith.” John 
  Locke’s famous defense of toleration concurs: “Neither the profession of any 
  articles of faith, nor the conformity to any outward form of worship . . . can 
  be available to the salvation of souls, unless the truth of the one, and the 
  acceptableness of the other unto God, be thoroughly believed by those that so 
  profess and practice. But penalties are no ways capable to produce such 
  belief. It is only light and evidence that can work a change in men’s 
  opinions; and that light can in no manner proceed from corporal sufferings, or 
  any other outward penalties.” The voluntarist argument relies on a contested 
  Protestant theology of salvation that stresses inward persuasion, assent, and 
  experience of God’s grace.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Another great Madisonian 
  argument against establishment is that it is bad for religion: “During almost 
  fifteen centuries, has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. 
  What have been its fruits? More or less in all places, pride and indolence in 
  the Clergy, ignorance and servility in the laity, in both, superstition, 
  bigotry and persecution.” In his view, establishment degrades the spiritual 
  health of the flock by corrupting clergy with self&#8209;interest and 
  self&#8209;indulgence. It saps the dedication and drive of the laity by undermining 
  their confidence in its self-sufficient strength. The effect is to “weaken in 
  those who profess this Religion, a pious confidence in its innate excellence, 
  and the patronage of its author; and to foster in those who still reject it a 
  suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies to trust it to 
  its own merits.” Again, Madison’s case depends on a religious premise: the 
  value of a particular kind of spiritual flourishing. Far from insisting on the 
  separation of politics and theology, Madison and the other architects of 
  American secularism articulated a<i> political theology of separation</i>.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: .5in">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">Are their arguments still relevant today? 
  Just ask Sayyid Iyad Jamaleddine, an Iraqi Shiite cleric, and one of the true 
  revolutionaries calling for absolute separation of mosque and state in Iraq: 
  “I am a Muslim. I am devoted to my religion. I want to get it back from the 
  state and that is why I want a secular state. . . . When young people come to 
  religion, not because the state orders them to but because they feel it 
  themselves in their hearts, it actually increases religious devotion.” Madison 
  couldn’t have said it better.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family:Verdana">Those seeking a toe-hold for liberal 
  democracy in Islamic societies: “Secularism is not blasphemy. . . . The Koran 
  is a book to be interpreted [by] each age. Each epoch should not be tied to 
  interpretations from 1,000 years ago. We should be open to interpretations 
  based on new and changing times.” Cultural critics like Ibn Warraq and Pervez 
  Hoodbhoy contend that there can be no lasting democratic reform of Islamic 
  societies without doctrinal reform of Islam so as to embrace reason, science, 
  and free inquiry. Like Locke and Madison before them, these Islamic would-be 
  founders can construct their cases for secularism only by ignoring the 
  confines of the privacy model.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-family:Verdana">This is not to say that only 
  religious people can be genuine secularists. Madison himself was no orthodox 
  Christian, and Warraq is an unbeliever. Today secularists range from pious 
  Baptists and Jews to born-again atheists, and the great unchurched in between. 
  It is to say that the full defense of secularism inevitably involves 
  controversial religious claims. To the extent that secularism forbids public 
  deliberation about such claims, it becomes self-undermining.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Granted, 
  there is no doubt one sense in which it is unproblematic to say that religion 
  is a private affair. It is and ought to be a <i>non-governmental</i> affair. 
  The apparatus of state power should not be placed under clerical control or 
  used to favor any religion (or religion over irreligion). If <i>that</i> is 
  what secularists mean by “private,” they would do well to simply say what they 
  mean, and retire the troublesome concept of privacy.</span></p>

  <span style="font-family:Verdana">Nearly twenty years ago, Father Richard John 
  Neuhaus denounced the “naked public square.” As he saw it, religion was being 
  driven out of public life by secularism taken too far. Today, politics is 
  pious as never before, and it’s the secularists who find themselves with no 
  clothes.</span></p>

    <span style="font-family: Verdana">American secularism has reached an 
    impasse. In a post-theocratic but religious society, the project of 
    “privatizing” conscience can lead nowhere but into strategic blunders and 
    intellectual incoherence. With its ambiguity between the personal, the 
    sectarian, the subjective, and the non-governmental, the concept of privacy 
    is too crude a tool to properly frame secularist arguments. Yet by 
    relegating conscience to the world of subjectivity, the philosophy of 
    privacy insulates it from due public scrutiny. If they want to resist the 
    social agenda of theological conservatism, liberals will have to do better 
    than asking the devout to please refrain from speaking their minds. Better 
    to look to the philosophy of our church-state fathers, and the democratic 
    hopefuls of Islam. They remind us that for secularism to hold sway in a 
    religious society, it has no choice but to engage with the substance of 
    conscience.&nbsp; (The end)</span></p>
