		Kaafee Billah walked into his Gaithersburg office shortly before 9 a.m. 
		Tuesday. The 39-year-old sales representative, who had recently started 
		working at the medical company
		<a target href="http://financial.washingtonpost.com/custom/wpost/html-qcn.asp?dispnav=business&mwpage=qcn&symb=MEDI&nav=el">
		MedImmune Inc.</a>, made the first call from his desk at 9:02. Roughly 
		40 minutes later, he called 911 to say he needed medical help.<p>Almost 
		10 hours passed before someone found his body lying on the floor.</p>
		<p>Police say an apparent phone glitch sent emergency personnel to the 
		wrong address, leading them to believe that the 911 call was unfounded.</p>
		<p>&quot;There is no way at this time to say if he would have survived the 
		event if rescue personnel had reached him in a timely manner,&quot; the 
		police officer who documented his death wrote in a preliminary report. 
		&quot;The error is in the technology of the company phone system.&quot;</p>
		<p>Billah had a brief conversation with a 911 dispatcher, police said.</p>
		<p>&quot;He was able to communicate a few words before there was no longer 
		communication with him,&quot; police spokeswoman Lucille Baur said.</p>
		<p>Pete Piringer, a spokesman for Montgomery County's Fire and Rescue 
		Service, said: &quot;The caller struggled with the information. He did say he 
		needed an ambulance for chest pains.&quot;</p>
		<p>Billah was not able to provide an address, Baur said. When 911 
		dispatchers in Montgomery County are unable to get an exact location 
		from a caller or when they receive a call from someone who hangs up, 
		they make an effort to identify the location and send help.</p>
		<p>A dispatcher sent emergency personnel to the address determined by 
		computerized caller identification: 35 W. Watkins Mill Road, one of 
		several MedImmune buildings in the area. But Billah's office was in an 
		adjacent building: 25 W. Watkins Mill Road.</p>
		<p>The emergency personnel &quot;searched the premises but did not find the 
		victim,&quot; according to the police report. Piringer said they looked for 
		six to seven minutes.</p>
		<p>About 7 p.m., 911 dispatchers received another call from the 
		MedImmune building at 25 W. Watkins, this time from a worker who had 
		found Billah's body on the floor.</p>
		<p>The medical examiner's office in Baltimore said yesterday that the 
		cause of death remained under investigation. Police said there is no 
		evidence of foul play.</p>
		<p>Jamie Lacey, a spokeswoman for MedImmune, confirmed that an employee 
		had died but declined to discuss details.</p>
		<p>Baur said Billah worked in a private office.</p>
		<p>&quot;He wasn't in a cubicle in a public area,&quot; she said. &quot;His job 
		required travel and, because he was a new employee, he had not developed 
		close friendships with other employees who might have casually visited.&quot;</p>
		<p>Lt. Eric Burnett, a police spokesman, said emergency calls made from 
		some corporate phone systems are sometimes traced to the wrong address 
		because phone lines in multiple buildings are traced to a single 
		location.</p>
		<p>That is a problem that 911 dispatchers have struggled with for 
		several years, said Bill Cade, director of 911 services and 
		communications center operations at the Association of Public-Safety 
		Communications Officials International.</p>
		<p>He said large phone systems use technology that can make it hard for 
		emergency personnel to trace the exact location of a call in a business 
		campus or resort.</p>
		<p>&quot;Readers who work for big businesses might want to ask themselves, 
		'What's the impact on me if I were to have an emergency in one of these 
		locations?' &quot; Cade said. &quot;They're real issues, and they're everyday 
		issues. We don't know how many times it happens. But if it happens to 
		you, it's one time too many.&quot;</p>
		<p>He said several companies have been reluctant to invest in software 
		that allows emergency responders to trace phone calls in large corporate 
		settings to specific locations. Such programs cost about $10,000, he 
		said.</p>
		<p>His organization has given awards in recent years to universities and 
		other large institutions that invest in software and technology that 
		allows dispatchers to easily trace emergency calls.</p>
		<p>Billah's relatives could not be reached. Billah was an immigrant from 
		Bangladesh who obtained a PhD in agricultural economics from Cornell 
		University in 2002.</p>
		<p>&quot;He was a good student,&quot; said William H. Lesser, chairman of the 
		university's Department of Applied Economics and Management. &quot;I know he 
		kept in touch with the department on occasion.&quot;</p>
