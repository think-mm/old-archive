        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The
        incident of September 11 has affected a lot of people in many ways.&nbsp;
        However, I believe it has a long-term&nbsp;impact on the way the
        minorities will be treated in this country. For the first time in my
        life in the US, I am&nbsp;realizing the&nbsp;loneliness of being part of
        the&nbsp;minority group. As I hear&nbsp;more and&nbsp;more&nbsp;news of
        incidents of racial harassment, I feel embarrassed and ashamed.&nbsp; A
        friend was saying that he heard on the radio, someone suggesting that
        all Muslims in the US should be put in the concentration camps.&nbsp;Another
        friend had trash piled up in front of her apartment. My cousin who had
        moved to the USA 25 years ago when he was 10 years old and had married
        an American woman got death threat on the phone. My brother’s
        brother-in-laws got interrogated by FBI agents. One Pakistani gentle man
        was asked to leave the airplane right before it was ready to take off.
        It goes on and on. It is surprising to see&nbsp;that this one single
        incident of the World Trade Center has made some people of the ‘land
        of immigrants’&nbsp;to stereotype all Muslims/ South East Asians to be
        terrorists! <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">All
        these reports of racial bias are also changing the way I perceive myself
        in this country.&nbsp; Two days after the WTC incident, I went to the
        grocery store in salwar kamiz. Although this is nothing unusual,&nbsp;but
        I felt different this time. Being the only one in the store in a
        different outfit from the rest, I felt that some angry eyes&nbsp;were
        following me. I am used to people here asking me if I was from the
        Middle East or Pakistan.&nbsp;Could&nbsp;it be that because of my looks
        and outfit people were thinking I come from the terrorist groups – I&nbsp;ask
        myself?&nbsp; Maybe they&nbsp;were cursing me in their minds -- who
        knows. My looks and outfit perhaps were making them suspicious about me.
        <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">However,
        this stands in stark contrast the way I have been treated in my past
        years of life in the US.&nbsp;Not so long ago people&nbsp;would come to
        me and complement my sari or salwar kamiz. I always felt proud of such
        an elegant outfit called sari. But for the first time, I regretted&nbsp;not
        wearing jeans in a public place, and&nbsp;being the target of suspicions
        of many angry minds as a result. I feel that my skin color and name will
        never make me an American in the eyes of others no matter how hard I try
        to speak in American accent and no matter how long I live in this
        country. Maybe the racial ill feelings had always existed in the hearts
        of many people we see around.&nbsp; All it took was a&nbsp;catalyst for&nbsp;it&nbsp;to
        come out. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">My
        heart gets heavy as I think of all these possibilities. I got rid of all
        religious practices in my personal life long time ago and I am against
        all religious fanaticism especially Islamic terrorism but it is also
        true that I feel humiliated nonetheless. I feel sorry for myself for
        being a second-class citizen in the land of the affluent. I feel sad. I
        miss Bangladesh.</span></p>

  <p>Dear Friends,
  <p>I thank everybody who responded either on the forum or personally to my
  post, “I miss Bangladesh”. Special thanks to Sherry, Audrey and Penny who
  could see right through my heart even though they are not the first generation
  Americans like myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s
  people like them who make the world such a friendly place to live in. However,
  I would like to clarify a few points for the readers who might have
  misunderstood me.
  <p>I do know that racism exists in its full form in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi
  Muslims did break the temples when Babri mosque was demolished in India. Also,
  I do know that my Hindu friends are being routinely discriminated in
  Bangladesh. A significant part of my life was spent in the Chittagong Hill
  Tracts. What we have done to the innocent Chakma people starting from the
  building of the Kaptai dam until today is unforgivable. But the purpose of my
  write up was not to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the&nbsp;communalism&nbsp;in
  Bangladesh.
  <p>All these years, I only sympathized with the minority for the mistreatments
  they had received. But for the first time in my life, I can exactly feel what
  my minority friends regularly go through in Bangladesh. I cannot condemn the
  minority if one of them chooses to migrate to a place wherever he/she can live
  with dignity. Some of the Hindus have chosen to migrate to West Bengal. Does
  that mean West Bengal is free from any racism/communalism? NO. The Muslim
  minority is being discriminated in West Bengal. If racism in America fills my
  heart with sadness and makes me nostalgic for my birthplace, where I am not a
  minority, that does NOT imply that my birthplace does not discriminate against
  the minority living there.</p>
  <p>Any sort of racism, anywhere in the world is a deplorable act and should be
  protested!</p>
  <p>Warm Regards,</p>
  <p>Lopa Tasneem</p>

  Your feelings shared today are shared by&nbsp;almost all people&nbsp;from&nbsp;Muslim/south 
  Asian origin, everyone from&nbsp;someone who just bears an Islamic name to ones who 
  suddenly have to&nbsp;hide/defend their personal choices/practices&nbsp;&nbsp;(like those who 
  choose to wear hijab, on top of salwar kameez).</p>
  <p align="justify">But&nbsp;even faced&nbsp;with&nbsp;overt hostility, we have to&nbsp;remember, 
  just as&nbsp;the fanatics by their horrendous deeds have cast a shadow of suspicion 
  on the vast majority of population that happen to share their 
  ethnicity/religious background but in no way share their distorted views, the 
  acts of racial prejudice/hate crimes are committed by a small fraction of the 
  mainstream American community, that shouldn't be taken by us&nbsp;to be 
  representation of the mainstream. </p>
  <p align="justify">Here in San Antonio a local Persian restaurant was 
  vandalized (most likely not by &quot;patriotic americans&quot; teenage hooligans who 
  would be up to some other criminal activity if there were not doing this). 
  That is the negative. But the positive is since then, the restaurant is so 
  busy by the community to going there to eat to show support, there is an hour 
  wait now to get in. The Pakistani man who was pulled from the plane is now 
  showered with flowers/phone calls/ BTW, the man says he has no ill feelings 
  and has donated $5,000 to victim aid fund.</p>
  <p align="justify">Even though we have not experienced any backlash 
  personally, we are showered with questions/concerns if anything has happened 
  to us, are kids mean to my daughter at school etc. The neighbor who is a 
  policeman paid a special visit to our house so that we immediately report any 
  verbal abuse etc. A client called and asked if we experienced anything and 
  said &quot;I am so ashamed by the behavior of some of my countrymen.&quot; I assure all 
  that I have great faith in the average American citizen and we understand 
  these sporadic backlashes do not represent the average American, any more than 
  the terrorist represented the country/religion they hail from.</p>
  <p align="justify">I do understand those of us who live in a white collar 
  neighborhood and have a white collar job, and surrounded by educated and 
  informed people, are not facing anything near what a taxi driver in NY, 
  convenience store clerk in Miami, and countless other Asians/Muslims working 
  minimum wage jobs in high risk neighborhoods (even without the recent 
  incidents) are facing.&nbsp; I know at times like this one will long to be back 
  home and be one of the majority population and hot have this fear.&nbsp; But do I 
  wish to be back in Bangladesh to be part of the majority population again? </p>
  <p align="justify">Maybe for the time being. But from what I have seen 
  personally in Bangladesh and know about the subcontitent in general, our mob 
  reaction/lynch mentally and intolerance of towards ethnic&nbsp;minorities pales to 
  what is happening here pale in comparison. </p>
  <p align="justify">Throughout the history of mankind, it seems racial biases 
  are inherent in the genes of human kind, in some people they emerge when 
  situations are favorable for them to surface, just like cancer. But I would 
  rather be an ethnic minority in US than the majority in a lot other places in 
  the world.</p>
