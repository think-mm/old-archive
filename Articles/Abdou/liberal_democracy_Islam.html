	<div class="doc-layout-body">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Robin Wright and Bernard 
		Lewis both seem to address the question of whether there is an &quot;Islamic 
		Reformation&quot; going on now, and if there is, what content, direction, and 
		influence it is likely to have. The raising of this question betokens an 
		important shift in the way that Western observers view the Islamic 
		world. Wright and Lewis implicitly acknowledge that behind the 
		confrontations and violence that we witness today in many Muslim 
		societies, there lies a situation marked by some kind of pluralism and 
		opposition of ideas. In other words, there is not merely a fight, but a 
		debate. To recognize this is already to take a giant step away from the 
		familiar Western academic and journalistic stereotypes of Muslim 
		societies as places overwhelmed by religious fanaticism, rejection of 
		&quot;the other,&quot; and crises of identity. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">The dramatic importance of 
		the question under discussion should need no emphasis: Islam, one of the 
		major world religions, may be living through a turning point in its 
		history, one that will bring it face-to-face with the challenges of the 
		human condition at the end of the twentieth century. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Bernard Lewis proceeds 
		according to his well-known &quot;macrohistorical&quot; approach. He casts his 
		gaze across large spans of history, constitutive elements of Islamic 
		faith, and some features of Middle Eastern languages in order to 
		construct a grand schema that explains what is happening now and 
		illuminates its links with the mainstream of Islamic (and also Middle 
		Eastern) history. He draws on a larger arsenal of disciplines (history, 
		theology, linguistics) than does Wright, and discusses a greater variety 
		of subjects (religious beliefs, historical facts, [End Page 76] 
		linguistic usages and concepts) in order to create a highly seductive 
		synthesis of his own. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">While Lewis acknowledges 
		that the term &quot;Islam&quot; can be confusing, he himself is not always 
		sufficiently careful in his use of it. He goes back and forth from Islam 
		as a religion to Islam as a historical civilization, from detailed 
		observations to general remarks. He seems to be guided by the &quot;inner 
		logics&quot; that he sees lurking behind the observed data, molding 
		attitudes, behaviors, and ways of understanding. His conclusions about 
		the present situation point to a clash of such logics, one that pits 
		Muslim communities against their Western counterparts. These inner 
		logics are what he considers to be the true core of observed reality; 
		facts, which appear on the surface, manifest the core imperfectly, much 
		as the shadows that flicker on the wall of Plato's cave provide only a 
		crude representation of the realities that give them shape. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Robin Wright, in contrast, 
		adopts an approach at loggerheads with the one prevailing in specialized 
		academic circles. She prefers to try to understand the debate by 
		&quot;listening&quot; to two of its key participants: Iranian philosopher Abdul 
		Karim Soroush and Tunisian political leader Sheikh Rachid al-Ghannouchi. 
		Wright assumes that ideas, not conscious or unconscious determinisms, 
		rule human societies, which simply cannot be understood through external 
		observation or historical reconstruction alone. This, it would seem, is 
		why she has chosen, among living Muslim thinkers, to discuss two 
		prominent and highly controversial figures, each of whom is thought to 
		exert a large (and in all likelihood growing) influence on thoughtful 
		people in the Muslim world. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow"><b>Strange Companions</b>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">This approach, much simpler 
		than Lewis's and apparently without major risks, nonetheless raises a 
		troubling question: How and why did Wright choose her two subjects? In 
		posing this question I intend much more than the usual perfunctory 
		observation, to be completed by remarks about the complexity of the 
		situation, the availability of a large set of potential subjects, and 
		the unavoidable arbitrariness of choice. In no way can one say that the 
		two thinkers presented are minor, ordinary, or random specimens of 
		contemporary Islamic thought. Indeed, they are generally considered to 
		represent something close to opposite extremes on a spectrum: Ghannouchi 
		is a main representative of Islamist attitudes and thought (and faces 
		persecution from his government for that); Soroush is a formidable 
		intellectual opponent of Islamism (for which he, too, faces persecution 
		from his government). These considerations are by no means peripheral; 
		they must be taken into account in any analysis that groups these two 
		men together as workers in a single project. In fact, Wright's 
		surprising decision to group them together is not devoid of logic, but 
		it is a logic that she does not elaborate. [End Page 77] </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">In what way can we consider 
		both Ghannouchi and Soroush--the Islamist and the critic of Islamism--to 
		be representatives of an ongoing &quot;Islamic Reformation&quot;? Is the 
		opposition between the tendencies that they represent merely apparent, 
		or do we face two opposite ways of reforming Islam? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">It should be observed 
		beforehand that many controversies surrounding Islamic thought focus so 
		heavily on semantics, on names for ideas and persons, that the real 
		issues often disappear from sight. Many thinkers who are called or who 
		call themselves &quot;Islamists&quot; make such large concessions to the power of 
		unaided human reason that one may wonder what is left to render their 
		thought Islamic. On the other hand, many secularists, especially 
		nationalists, pay such reverence to Islamic dogmas that one may wonder 
		if reason has any role left to play in their thought. The whole 
		confrontation sometimes seems like so much posturing, where the real 
		choices are never clarified or faced. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Does this apply to Soroush 
		and Ghannouchi? Both, it is true, seem to accept Islam as a point of 
		reference and to concentrate their efforts in an attempt, as Wright 
		says, &quot;to reconcile Islam and modernity by creating a worldview that is 
		compatible with both.&quot; There is, however, an important difference masked 
		by their apparent allegiance to the same flag. For Ghannouchi, the 
		principal question is always how to free the community from backwardness 
		and dependence on &quot;the other.&quot; However significant his concessions in 
		favor of democracy and freedom of thought, the community--not the 
		individual--remains for him the ultimate reality and objective. 
		Democracy and freedom of thought are instruments that Muslims should use 
		to achieve their community's goals and defend its interests. They are 
		tools for raising the community of Muslims to the level of power and 
		efficiency that Western nations currently enjoy. Muslims can use these 
		tools, argues Ghannouchi, because they work and because they are not 
		opposed to Islamic principles, which remain the ultimate standard.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Soroush is not interested 
		in showing Muslims how to achieve a more advantageous competitive 
		position in the struggle with &quot;the other.&quot; For him, the main adversary 
		dwells within Muslims themselves, or rather within a complex of 
		traditions that has long barred Muslims from the free implementation of 
		reason and from direct contact with the sources of their faith. The 
		urgent task is therefore to free Muslims from Islam understood as a 
		social and historical heritage, as a set of overwhelming [End Page 78] 
		external conventions defining views and behavior, or, to use Henri 
		Bergson's expression, as a &quot;closed religion.&quot; 1 Soroush wants to make 
		followers of Islam more inwardly Muslim by enabling them to adopt a 
		piety based on free adherence and personal commitment rather than 
		custom, habit, and conformism. He argues further that this turn toward 
		Islam understood as an &quot;open religion&quot; represents not a radical 
		innovation, but rather a return to the original essence of the faith in 
		its purity. For him, the basic reality and objective is the person, the 
		individual believer. In this, Soroush is closer to modern humanism and 
		is a true reformer. Ghannouchi, by contrast, is not. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow"><b>Responses to 
		Secularization</b> </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Taken together, Soroush and 
		Ghannouchi illustrate the broad alternatives offered by the situation in 
		which Muslim societies now find themselves as they face the inescapable 
		challenges of secularization in the modern world. It should be stressed 
		that secularization is a comparatively recent phenomenon. It began in 
		Western Europe and has spread throughout the world. Its pace and exact 
		form have varied a great deal from place to place, depending on a host 
		of political, sociological, economic, and other variables. The world's 
		religions have adopted varying responses to it, usually featuring some 
		mixture of adaptation and self-defense designed to meet the new 
		conditions. In short, societies have shown different ways of responding 
		to the secularizing tendency. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Muslim societies have not 
		experienced secularization as an internal or autonomous move. (Some 
		scholars believe that such a move did begin within Islamic societies in 
		the eighteenth century, but was never allowed to unfold autonomously.) 
		External influences either started the secularization process or 
		disrupted it (another point on which historians disagree). But 
		secularization is already a reality in the Muslim world. No Muslim 
		society today is governed solely with reference to religious law; 
		religious traditions no longer possess absolute or near-absolute 
		predominance (except perhaps in some remote rural areas); and newly 
		emerging leadership classes are almost everywhere displacing or 
		marginalizing the clerisy of theologico-legal experts who used to 
		control meaning and organization in these societies. Yet even while all 
		this has been happening, Islamic reformation has not yet been 
		accomplished. In the Muslim world, secularization is preceding religious 
		reformation--a reversal of the European experience in which 
		secularization was more or less a consequence of such reformation.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Wright's examination of 
		Soroush and Ghannouchi offers us excellent examples of the responses 
		that this evolution has elicited. These responses point in two opposite 
		directions. There are voices, like Ghannouchi's, calling for a return to 
		the &quot;implicit constitution&quot; 2 that [End Page 79] Islam is supposed to 
		have provided (and which may not be opposed to democracy, or may even 
		find in it a good expression of some of Islam's requirements). These are 
		typically calls to resist &quot;Westernization&quot; and to return to the original 
		(and never fully implemented) Islamic constitution via a course of 
		general reform that usually involves the moralization of public affairs 
		and of political and social relationships. Appeals like these are 
		reminiscent of the &quot;natural and cyclical reflex&quot; to seek a purified and 
		more forceful version of Islam that the fourteenth-century Arab 
		historian Ibn Khaldun observed in Muslim societies whenever rulers 
		exceeded the limits of the tolerable. For all their sincerity and 
		effectiveness in terms of influence on the masses, such appeals grow out 
		of attitudes that are trapped in the past. They can in no way lead to a 
		real democratization of society. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">By refusing to make 
		religion the only means of reforming society, the other and opposed 
		response tries to free Muslims from the &quot;Khaldunian&quot; cycle of rigorous 
		reform enforced by an energetic outgroup, followed by the corruption and 
		enervation of the reformers. This view recommends the reform of 
		religious feeling and belief as the best means of making men free and 
		responsible, and of placing them on the surest path to ordered and 
		enduring liberty. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Soroush surely belongs to 
		what Wright describes as &quot;a growing group of Islamic reformers&quot; who &quot;are 
		shaping thought about long-term issues,&quot; and whom she contrasts to 
		&quot;reactive and proactive groups [that] address the immediate problems of 
		Islam's diverse and disparate communities.&quot; Ghannouchi, clearly, belongs 
		with these latter groups. If we adopt the comparison with what happened 
		in Christendom, the dividing line between Soroush and Ghannouchi is more 
		or less equivalent to the one that separated the Reformation from the 
		Counterreformation. </font></p>
