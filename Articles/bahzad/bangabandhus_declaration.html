	The purpose of this brief write-up is to present a counter picture as 
	historical facts against what is evidently going to be published in 
	different papers by the BNP-led government on the 26<sup>th</sup> March. For 
	years together, like many spectators, I have been watching some recycling 
	peculiar supplementaries in different papers, which is putting up a picture 
	of Late Ziaur Rahman (Zia) on the top of the page and cram with several 
	parroted and repeated write-ups and comments. Most of the writers 
	contributing to the supplementaries have nothing to do but to praise Zia as 
	the sole declarer of independence and to claim that it was only because of 
	him we are in the position of celebrating the 26<sup>th</sup> March and the 
	16<sup>th</sup> December. Among these reappearing writers there are people 
	who either have doctorate before their names or often act as pet-spokesmen 
	of BNP or have earned some kind of portfolio benefit by serving BNP. I have 
	no comments on these brainless protégés and stooges of BNP, because I am not 
	at all jealous if I find that the supporters of any party are glorifying 
	their leader. However, when this glorification attempts to distort the true 
	history of my country, I, as a conscious and non-partisan citizen, cannot 
	keep myself irresponsibly mum.</font></span></p>

	As the 26<sup>th</sup> March is approaching, we are dead sure that the 
	BNP-led government once again is going to publish a recycling supplementary, 
	inevitably portraying Zia as the declarer of independence and the sole 
	leader of our liberation war. Since the 26<sup>th</sup> March entails mainly 
	the issue of the declaration of independence along with certain new 
	fantasies of the recent past, I would like to concentrate on the true

	It has been claimed by some protégés of BNP that Zia was the first to 
	declare independence and it was his declaration that brought out mass people 
	for a liberation war. To be very straightforward, this claim is an utter 
	fallacy filled with sweet fantasies. In fact, even Zia in his lifetime never 
	claimed that he was the first to declare independence. In front Zia nobody 
	of BNP ever claimed or dared to claim that Zia declared independence. The 
	reason was that Zia had very strong personality as an army officer and was 
	uncompromising in his personal life about speaking the truth. He strongly 
	disliked people flattering him and that is why the stooges of today had no 
	access to Zia in his lifetime. I shall give you one example from many in 
	this short write-up. Mir Shawkat was very close to Zia. During Zia’s 
	lifetime he himself admitted that he heard the powerful voice of MA Hannan 
	announcing for the first time the declaration of independence on behalf of 
	Bangabandhu from Chittagong Radio on the 26<sup>th</sup> March 1971. Please 
	find his statement in the 15 volumes of historical accounts, which Zia 
	himself took very sincere initiative to compile and publish. I do not know 
	how people with political interest evaluate Zia about his honesty to the 
	liberation war, but his sincere and uncompromising efforts for the 
	compilation and publication of the 15-volume historical accounts of our 
	liberation war has truly made him an adorer of independence. And that is why 
	in the original version of those 15 volumes the declaration of independence 
	by Bangabandhu was included without any question, by Zia himself. If he 
	wished or had the declaration been a sceptical one, Zia could have easily 
	discarded that declaration from the volumes, but he did not do that because 
	of two reasons. Firstly, he knew about declaration very much, which he 
	himself learnt on the 26<sup>th</sup> March 1971 in Chittagong and secondly, 
	he was not at all craving for snatching any undue credits. But it is really 
	very ridiculous that after the death of Zia in 1981 a few crooked stooges of 
	BNP have been unnecessarily engaged in making him equivalent to Bangabandhu 
	– this is practically an absurd approach. We are quite aware why BNP is so 
	eager to pull Zia up to the level of Bangabandhu, which is just impractical, 
	but today I am not going to discuss on that. Rather let us see the events of 
	declaration of independence by Bangabandhu and others. In very brief let me 
	inform you that there are many authentic documents on the declaration of 
	independence by Bangabandhu available with me and I would mention a few 
	points here from those references.</font></span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Arial"><font size="3">
	First of all it is important to note that Bangabandhu believed in the 
	Gandhian philosophy of “non-violence” and wanted a bloodless, peaceful and 
	democratic solution for attaining absolute autonomy built on 6-points. He 
	was dead sure that the autonomy would have led to an independent Bangladesh 
	with popular support from international community. General Yahya also 
	assured Bangabandhu that an LFO would be formulated to give full autonomy to 
	East Pakistan and its people, and that is why Bangabandhu patiently waited 
	even until 25<sup>th</sup> March evening in 1971. However, with apprehension 
	he was also ready for any treacherous suppressive move by the Pakistani 
	junta, if Yahya had planned not to accept the framework of autonomy proposed 
	by Awami League. The preparation was like declaration of independence and 
	start of an all-out freedom-fight to counter any possible attack by 
	Pakistani armed forces. As part of this plan Bangabandhu got a pre-recorded 
	message ready for transmission as a counteraction against this type of 
	possible crackdown.</font></span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Arial"><font size="3">
	Unfortunately Yahya Khan opted for a crackdown instead of providing an 
	agreeable LFO. The apprehensive crackdown began at 11.00pm of the 25<sup>th</sup> 
	March 1971. Therefore, this time Bangabandhu had no other option but to okay 
	the transmission of the pre-recorded message of declaration. At around 
	11.30pm of 25<sup>th</sup> March 1971 this pre-recorded message went in the 
	air from a handy transmitter purposefully set up at Boldha Garden. Many in 
	Dhaka heard this message because it was cleverly transmitted on the 
	frequency very close to Radio Pakistan Dacca. The purpose of this 
	transmission was to inform the foreign journalists and diplomats listening 
	naturally to Radio Pakistan Dacca about the compelling action of declaring 
	independence against the crackdown by Pakistani army. This move was 
	successful because many heard the message very clearly, among whom was David 
	Loshak of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph of London, who was 
	then in Dhaka on duty. Back to London a few weeks after the 25<sup>th</sup> 
	March he published an authentic book called “Pakistan Crisis”. When this 
	book was published Bangladesh was still a couple of months away from 
	independence. So there should not be any dearth of doubt that Bangabandhu 
	made a declaration of independence – at least this is the book, which is 
	above any doubt – (even Zia certified this declaration during his reign). 
	Tikka Khan also mentioned about this declaration while giving an interview 
	to Musa Sadik and Rezaur Rahman (of Ain Adalat) during the SAARC summit in 
	Pakistan in the 1980s. Moreover, Bangladesh documents published by Foreign 
	Ministry of Indian Government also contains this declaration. To speak the 
	truth, although heard by small number of people, this was the very first 
	declaration of independence in the real sense by Bangabandhu. The message 
	read like this: <i>“This may be my last message. From today Bangla Desh is 
	independent. I call upon the people of Bangla Desh, wherever you are and 
	with whatever you have, to resist the army of occupation to the last. Your 
	fight must go on until the last soldier of the </i></font></span><i>

	Pakistan occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangla Desh and final 
	victory is achieved.” Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</font></span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Arial"><font size="3"> 
	The text of this message was also transmitted through EPR wirelesses 
	throughout the country all-over Bangladesh. However, it may be mentioned 
	here that in his historic 7<sup>th</sup> March speech he gave a clarion call 
	for independence and liberation war in a diplomatic language for technical 
	reasons.</font></span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Arial"><font size="3">
	Moreover, apart from signalling his men to transmit the pre-recorded message 
	Bangabandhu also dictated another message of declaration of war after 
	11.00pm of the 25<sup>th</sup> March. The dictation was given, among others, 
	to Dr Mazharul Islam, Col (retired) Osmani and Tajuddin Ahmed. After the 
	pre-recorded message was transmitted the second message was also given to 
	EPR for transmission all-over the country as well. The message read like 
	this: <i>“Pak Army suddenly attacked EPR base at Pilkhana, Rajarbagh Police 
	Line and killing citizens. Street battles are going on in every street of

	During that time the telecommunication system was not very efficient and 
	that is why some parts of the country received the first message while other 
	parts received only the second one. However, in some parts of the country 
	both the messages were picked up. </font></span></p>

	Anyway, whichever the message was, the contents were very clear to the 
	receivers – that Bangabandhu declared independence. After the receipt of the 
	message(s) instant measure was taken up by political leaders to announce the 
	declaration of independence by using loudspeakers. It is important to note 
	that when Bangabandhu gave his messages and instructions it was late night 
	of the 25<sup>th</sup> March 1971, but the mass people all-over the country 
	received this declaration on the next day, i.e. the 26<sup>th</sup> March. 
	That is why our Independence Day is observed on the 26<sup>th</sup> March.</font></span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Arial"><font size="3">
	Specially for Chittagong Bangabandhu’s strategy was different. As an initial 
	strike of the freedom-fight he wanted his people and armed forces to 
	liberate Chittagong and proceed to Comilla. Besides the above-mentioned 
	formal messages he also sent a couple of secret instructions in this regard 
	to Chittagong through telephone lines by Nayeem Gohor and Mosharraf Hossain 
	(presently energy and mineral resource minister). Bangabandhu wanted to make 
	sure that his instructions had been reached without any fail to the intended 
	receivers of Chittagong and that is why he opted for two persons at a time 
	to convey the same instructions through two different telephone lines.</font></span></p>

	In Chittagong many people received both the formal messages. They copied 
	them with carbon papers and in cyclostyles and distributed among the people. 
	Loudspeakers were also used to disseminate the contents of the messages. One 
	of the leading Awami League leaders of Chittagong MA Hannan took a 
	remarkably courageous step. For a brief period he managed to switch on 
	Chittagong Radio and broadcast the contents of the messages as the first 
	person to do so on behalf of Bangabandhu at 2.30pm on the 26<sup>th</sup> 
	March 1971. This was followed by similar repeated broadcasts quoting 
	Bangabandhu’s declaration in Dacca by the initiators of Swadhin Bangla 
	Biplobi Betar Kendra from Kalurghat. Almost all the leading global press and 
	broadcast media including those of India quoted these declarations on the 26<sup>th</sup> 
	and 27<sup>th</sup> March – Anil Bhattacharjiya of PTI was the man who 
	picked up the announcement of these messages and reported to Gouhati news 
	media. From there Akashbani, BBC and other news and press media came to know 
	about the declaration and broadcast its contents in their news items or 
	printed in their newspapers. Moreover, one Japanese ship anchored midstream 
	of Chittagong harbour also caught the message possibly from Shitakund 
	wireless station and informed the foreign countries about the declaration. 
	Radio Australia was the one to pick up and broadcast over the radio. 
	Australian newspapers also covered the news of Bangabandhu’s declaration of 
	independence. On the following day in the 27<sup>th</sup> March issue the 
	Statesman of India published the news that after the crackdown by the 
	Pakistani forces Sheikh Mujib declared Bangla Desh as Democratic Republic. 
	Moreover, the American Spot Report also mentioned that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman 
	declared East Pakistan a sovereign and independent People’s Republic of 
	Bangla Desh. Subsequently, many leading press media of the word covered the 
	news of declaration by Bangabandhu with his picture. Rest assured, I possess 
	all the references in regard to this declaration.</span></font></p>

	Ziaur Rahman as a Major of the 8<sup>th</sup> EBR of Chittagong also gave a 
	declaration on behalf of Bangabandhu on the 27<sup>th</sup> March 1971. He 
	was very spontaneous when Belal Mohammad Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra 
	requested him to give a declaration as a representative of military forces. 
	His first declaration was quite a long one which began with<i> “I Major 
	Ziaur Rahman do hereby declare the independence of </i></span><i>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">Bangladesh on 
	behalf of our great national leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman”</span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Arial">. 
	It was at 7.30pm on the 27<sup>th</sup> March – at least 40 hours after the 
	declaration by Bangabandhu and the start of mass resistance by common people 
	and Bengali armed forces. Therefore, against the facts mentioned herein 
	nobody has any scope of claiming that Zia was the first to declare the 
	independence of Bangladesh and it was his sole leadership that operated the 
	liberation war. Anybody claiming this would become a maker of ridiculous 
	fantasies. However, Zia’s declaration acted as immense encouragement for 
	those military personnel who heard it. We must also remember that it was 
	only in the name Bangabandhu our liberation war was carried out.</span></font></p>

	There is one more thing that is also brought forth linking the declaration 
	of independence issue. It is also claimed nowadays by BNP that it was Zia’s 
	declaration alone that gave a direction to an unprepared nation for a war. 
	This claim is also an utter fantasy. Very briefly, please be informed that 
	Bangabandhu was hundred percent prepared for a war, had the Pakistanis 
	compelled him to do so. Secretly before his 7<sup>th</sup> March Speech 
	India’s consent for all-out help was sought and ensured, MAG Osmani was made 
	the de-facto commander-in-chief of the liberation force, different sectors 
	were planned and divided, declaration of independence was recorded, meeting 
	between Indira Gandhi and Tajuddin was held on the 3<sup>rd</sup> April 
	1971, Bengali army officers met under Osmani’s command on the 4<sup>th</sup> 
	April for sector-wise encounters, and much more. Please read extremely 
	useful books like <i>Witness to Surrender, Muldhara Ekattur, Pakistan 
	Crisis, Emergence of a Nation, Bloodbath in Bangladesh, Swadhin Bangla Betar

	Finally let me tell you that the declaration of independence by Bangabandhu 
	is an absolute truth like the daylight. There is no scope of denying that, 
	because the events of the declaration are historical facts. Therefore, if 
	any quarter wants to discard these historical facts relating to Bangabandhu 
	and replace those with something imaginary or fantasies relating to Zia, 
	then the members have to make those particular days and time reappear and 
	fill those in with their imaginary events with action as they desire. 
	Practically this is just impossible, because without a time-machine the 
	historical facts of the past cannot be changed in any manner other than 
	telling some lies – and it is crime to replace truths with lies. So the 
	people who are engaged in discarding the declaration of Bangabandhu from the 
	annals of our liberation war are not only doing crimes but also dishonouring 
	a man, for whom we take pride on a glorious liberation war and are 
	honourably independent today on the globe. Moreover, we must remember it is 
	human quality to pay respect and gratitude to someone when one does a favour 
	for us. Even from that perspective these history distorters are lacking a 
	human quality to claim themselves as real human beings. On the auspicious 
	day of the 26<sup>th</sup> March I appeal to the nation, please crush the 
	evil attempts of distortion of our glorious history and disseminate the real 
	facts among common people, especially the new generation and children. We 
	must remember that our history is our pride and we must uphold this for our 
	respectful existence.</font></span></p>
