	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The age-old saying that truth shall 
	prevail does not prevail in Bangladesh. This has once again been proven in 
	the recent controversy of granting the presidential pardon to a double 
	murder convict, who has been an active leader of the BNP’s youth wing since 
	its inception and currently happens to be a leader of an overseas branch of 
	BNP. The pardon was granted by the President in accordance with Article 49 
	of the Constitution (Prerogative of Mercy) which says, “The President shall 
	have power to grant pardons, reprieves and respites and to remit, suspend or 
	commute any sentence passed by any court, tribunal or other authority”. 
	However, as outlined in Article 48(3) of the constitution, “save that of 
	appointing the Prime Minister (PM) and the Chief Justice, the President 
	shall act in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister”. This clause 
	would naturally lead any one to assume that the pardon was granted according 
	to the advice of the PM. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The crime of double murder was 
	committed in January 25, 1982, when the country, for the second time, was 
	under martial law and the verdict of a martial law court was proclaimed on 
	July 20 of the same year in which all four accused were awarded capital 
	punishment. Two of them were executed while the other two, including the 
	convict in question were absconding. None of the two victims had any direct 
	political links and as such, the double killing, probably, was not a 
	political motivated one nor the murder case against the accused was 
	initiated out of political acrimony. Although, the pardon was granted in 
	January 13, 2005 the incident caught public and media outcry only when an 
	opposition law maker raised the issue in a meeting of the parliamentary 
	standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs on July 21, 
	2005. In response to the accusation of impropriety of the Presidential 
	pardon, the law minister in turn accused the Home Ministry by disclosing, 
	“When they sent us the summary, asking whether the President can grant 
	amnesty, we just replied that the president has indeed the power to do it, 
	but it rests entirely on him whether to pardon one or not. We did not make 
	any comment for or against the amnesty.” If the matter had ended there, it 
	would, to certain extent, absolve the law minister from the subsequent 
	responsibilities and controversies. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In response to the accusation made 
	by the secretary to the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) that the law 
	minister had a direct hand in the arrangement and the process of managing 
	the Presidential pardon, the honourable law minister not only denied his 
	acquaintance with the convict but personally went to the court to initiate a 
	defamation suit against the secretary of SCBA. The court in turn went out of 
	its traditional practice by issuing an immediate order of warrant of arrest 
	against the Secretary of SCBA. The Home Ministry was very swift to dispatch 
	the police force which raided the house of the accused, not once, but twice 
	on the same night. In the following morning, after receiving the bail from 
	the High Court, the secretary to the SCBA opened the Pandora’s Box 
	publishing the pictures of the convict, not only with the law minister but 
	with the finance minister as well and the story behind the pardon that 
	linked the PM and other ministers as well. Upon caught red-handed for 
	obvious deception, the law minister, making a U-turn from his earlier 
	stance, has now aimed his irritations at the martial law courts which in his 
	own words were ‘illegal’ and ‘kangaroo courts’. He defended his support for 
	the pardon as an act of ‘upholding human rights and democracy’, a strange 
	proposition from a strong propitiator of the killing by ‘crossfire’, a 
	flagrant violation of basic human right and rule of law. Law minister’s 
	latest assertion about the martial law court raised more questions than it 
	answers and threw him more into hot water since the honourable minister 
	himself has wilfully and faithfully served both the martial law regimes and 
	played a pivotal role in orchestrating and piloting the 5th and 7th 
	amendments of the constitution through the parliament that legalized the 
	‘illegal’ acts of the both the extra-constitutional regimes. His utterance 
	has also shaken the legal foundation of both the political parties that grew 
	out of the ‘illegal’ martial laws of which he was an active propitiator. If 
	the leaders of the political party that he currently belongs share his views 
	on this issue, it is only imperative that both the 5th and 7th amendments of 
	the constitution should be declared null and avoid by the parliament and the 
	appropriate retribution should be granted to the kin of the hundreds of 
	victims of the so-called ‘kangaroo courts’, albeit the government does not 
	have the power to revert any one back to life. The law minister has found a 
	staunch ally, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law 
	and parliamentary affairs, in his newly-indoctrinated jihad to prove the 
	‘illegality’ of the martial law court. Ironically, this renowned lawyer and 
	current law maker belonging to the ruling coalition, who once as a amicus 
	curiae also provided the lone opinion of descent against the annulment of 
	the indemnity act of the 5th amendment, tooth and nail defended the 
	extra-judicial killing in the name of so-called ‘crossfire’ by RAB in a 
	recently held human right conference in London. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Article 49 of the constitution that 
	empowers the President to grant ‘mercy’ does not explain the situations 
	under which the President may exercise his prerogative power. It was 
	imperative that this power, equivalent to that of Almighty God, should be 
	exercised judiciously and should be offered to one with the highest degree 
	of remorse in addition to known and commendable service to the nation or to 
	the humanity or to one whose survival could potentially contribute immensely 
	to the cause of mankind. Commutation of death penalty of Colonel Taher, a 
	wounded and decorated hero of our war of national liberation, handed down by 
	a martial law court could have been an ideal case to follow the letter and 
	the spirit of the constitutional prerogative of mercy. Did the Honourable 
	President meet that implied expectation of the nation in granting the 
	pardon? The convict in his mercy petition did not glorify any of his 
	contribution to the nation or mankind, rather, in favour of his clemency, he 
	very candidly pointed out his ‘devotion to Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman 
	and his 19 points programs’ which incidentally were formulated during the 
	tenure of his martial law regime. If the same document, as pointed out by 
	the law minister that contained no recommendation to grant the mercy was 
	sent from the PM’s office to the President, then the lion share of the onus 
	rests with the Head of the state. In any democracy, where there exists even 
	a little semblance of accountability, citizens have the right to know from 
	the Head of the State himself the ground of the Presidential clemency. On 
	the other hand, in line with the verbal assurance of the PM to ‘redress the 
	convict from injustice’ while he personally met the PM in Geneva, then the 
	PM, the chief executive of an elected government, has a lot of explaining to 
	do to the nation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In any society where ethics is not 
	an endangered virtue, accountability is the principle cornerstone of 
	democracy and rule of law triumphs at all time, flip-flops of the government 
	involving the Presidential clemency would have induced a chain of 
	resignations, starting with the law minister, shaking the very foundation of 
	the government. Quite to the contrary, defamation suit has been initiated by 
	the law minister raising the natural query of whose fame has been defamed 
	any way? <br>
