	<font face="Verdana">The honorable finance minister of Bangladesh has the 
	reputation of being very candid in his disposition no matter if his remarks 
	carry any merits in logical arbitration. He is in the fore front of 
	government’s crusade against the news media, which, according to his views, 
	are the main culprits in tarnishing the image of the country. In reference 
	to the recent observations of the World Bank President that ‘corruption’ and 
	‘confrontational politics’ are the major impediments to Bangladesh’s 
	economic growth, the finance minister has promptly responded by 
	acknowledging, never done by any one in the past, that “the source of this 
	confrontation lies in 1971 since when the nation has been divided into two 
	camps -- the so-called pro-liberation and anti-liberation forces. It is very 
	difficult to reconcile these feuding sides.&quot; The finance minister is 
	considered to be the second person in the BNP hierarchy and as such, there 
	is no reason to believe that his opinions did not carry the endorsement of 
	his party. This time around, the minister has set his foot in an uncharted 
	territory, albeit most people believe that the nation is very much divided; 
	but no one ever suggested that the division took place in 1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Any nation that has liberated itself from the yoke of foreign domination, 
	either through an armed struggle or through a political negotiation, carried 
	the support of bulk of its citizens, though not the support of each and 
	every of its sons. There were collaborators with the occupation or colonial 
	powers at all times. Even during the Japanese and German occupations of the 
	countries of Asia and Europe during World War II, people collaborated with 
	the occupation forces. However, their numbers were so insignificant as 
	compared to the number of people who fought for and supported their 
	liberation that it was never considered that the nations were divided in 
	their quest for freedom. In the general election of 1946, prior to the 
	creation of Pakistan, the Muslim League got a majority support only in the 
	province of Bengal. Nevertheless, it was never argued that the people of the 
	provinces of the newly created State were divided in their pursuit for a new 
	homeland. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	In all the countries that achieved freedom through armed struggle, the 
	collaborators, more or less, met the similar kind of fate in the aftermath 
	of the liberation. In China, many of them met the firing squad after a brief 
	trial. In Singapore, those who were pardoned for their relatively light 
	crimes were never given any government position in the liberated country. In 
	a lecture to the current generation, the founding PM of Singapore Mr. Lee 
	Kwan Yew, once elaborated that the principal strength of Singapore’s 
	elevation from an underdeveloped country to a modern developed nation in a 
	span of thirty years, came from its determined policy not to involve those 
	traitors in the affairs of the State. In Europe and North America, Nazi 
	collaborators are still being haunted and sent back to the country for trial 
	where the crimes have been committed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	In the liberation war of 1971, there are varying degrees of estimates about 
	the percentage of people who directly or indirectly collaborated with the 
	occupation power. In the words of the Pakistani General Rao Forman Ali, “90% 
	of the people of Bangladesh were taken in by the magical power of Sheikh 
	Mujib, and they were ready to sacrifice their lives for the creation of 
	Bangladesh”. If this estimate had validity, there were 10 percent of people 
	who sided with the Pakistani forces. Out of theses people, only the 
	supporters of the Jamati Islami have publicly defended their actions. A few 
	years ago, one of the senior ministers belonging to the BNP certified that 
	the Jamat did not do anything wrong by their active opposition to the 
	creation of Bangladesh. On the other hand, many people who were either 
	indifference or even collaborated with the occupation forces in 1971 still 
	very often like to share the credit by their utterances, such as, “we have 
	achieved the independence through armed struggle”, in order to bolster their 
	right as the sole vanguard of the nation.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	If one looks at the histories of nations that liberated themselves from the 
	colonial dominations, very few had the parallel of such massive support of 
	its people as enjoyed by Bangladesh movement. However, the basic difference 
	that the other nations were able to hold on to the values and virtues that 
	worked as the principle guiding force towards achieving the freedom while 
	Bangladesh miserably failed to hold onto them. This turning point occurred 
	on the tragic night of August 15 of 1975 when the chief architect of 
	nation’s freedom was brutally assassinated and so were the virtues on which 
	the newly created State was founded. That was the sad beginning of a 
	backward journey. Over the decades, distortion, deception, destruction, 
	deviation and dichotomy have taken the centre fold in every sphere of the 
	national life. At this moment, it has reached a point where it would be 
	difficult for the members of current generation to reflect back why the sons 
	of this soil took up arms and sacrificed their lives in 1971. Over the 
	years, leaders (and those who write in their support) of all the non-AL 
	governments have delivered sermon to the nation not to recollect and reflect 
	too much of the happenings of 1971, which in their views, would further 
	divide the nation. It would be really candid, at this time, to admit that 
	they have been successful beyond expectation in their pursuance. A few years 
	ago when a Dhaka-based Pakistani diplomat attributed the conflicts of 1971 
	as the works of the AL thugs, the longest serving (in the government) 
	Bangladeshi party did not even condemn the utterly humiliating attribution 
	until the Pakistani government itself issued its dissociation from the 
	observation of its diplomat. The silence of the party, on an issue of such 
	fundamental importance, did not create any dent in its credential in winning 
	back the power in the election of October 2001. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Truthfully, today, not in 1971, the nation is divided into two clear camps 
	as indicated by the finance minister. For instance, in 1971 a few dozens 
	Bangalee residents of Toronto were able to march through the street of the 
	city carrying the large portrait of their leader and were in unison in their 
	demand from the international community to prevent the genocide in their 
	motherland and the release of their leader. In contrast, today, more than 
	thirty thousand Bangalees or Bangladeshis in Toronto helplessly look on when 
	thousand of Pakistanis or Indians parade through the streets of Toronto on 
	August 14 and 15 carrying the portraits of M A Jinnah and Mohatma Gandhi, 
	the founding fathers of their nations. Our failure comes from our inability 
	to recite our history that has been written and re-written multiple times 
	and it included not the truth, but what the rulers of the day wanted to 
	hear. If what the honourable finance minister has indicated is true, except 
	for the variation of time line, then it would only fair to identify the camp 
	that the minister, the person who even did not know who Syed Nazrul Islam 
	was, obviously leads. In fact, in my logical assertion, both the finance 
	minister and the PM are in a moral high ground to lead the campaign to 
	eliminate the line of divide. In 1971, the finance minister used to live in 
	UK and I have never come across any of the narrations that would suggest the 
	minister’s participation either for or against the creation of Bangladesh. 
	Like wise, it was never clear that the PM, the then the wife of a middle 
	ranking army officer (who at that time was not an indispensable identity), 
	was a prisoner or in protective custody during the war of liberation. There 
	are enough testimonies to endorse the accusation that she refused to join 
	her husband in India when several freedom fighters volunteered to carry out 
	the arduous task. If she were a prisoner, simple hind sight would dictate 
	that she would be grateful to her liberator, which was negated when she 
	failed to deliver even a message of condolence when General J S Aurora 
	breathed his last a few months ago. Quite to contrary, as the PM, she defied 
	all the protocol to send a message of condolence directly to the family of 
	the deceased Pakistani Army Chief of Staff who was stationed in Dhaka in 
	1971. This action of the PM added more merits to the hypothesis of her being 
	in protective custody. The well-known freedom fighters of her party, the way 
	they have disparaged the supreme leader of our independence while getting 
	indoctrinated in BNP politics, would be out of ambiguity if they publicly 
	confess (many of them supposedly and privately have done so) that they, in 
	1971, were on the wrong side of the history. The pace at which the history 
	is marching backward, the time is probably not far away when the Bangladesh 
	government would publicly apologize to Pakistan for the wrongdoings of her 
	sons in 1971. And who would be better placed than our current PM to lead 
	that government?</font></p>
