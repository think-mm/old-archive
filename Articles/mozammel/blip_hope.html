	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Affirming that it is our sacred 
	duty to safeguard, protect and defend this Constitution and to maintain its 
	supremacy as the embodiment of the will of the people of Bangladesh so that 
	we may prosper in freedom and may make our full contribution towards 
	international peace and co-operation in keeping with the progressive 
	aspirations of mankind,” reads the preamble of the constitution of the 
	People’s Republic of Bangladesh. It further continues, “this Constitution 
	is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of 
	the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution 
	and other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.” In the 
	backdrop of the alliance government’s incessant move to politicize the 
	judiciary, the recent epoch-making judgement of a bench the High Court only 
	reaffirms the supremacy of the constitution as embodiment of the people of 
	the Republic. In their judgement delivered on August 29, 2005 the honourable 
	judges have declared the fifth amendment to the constitution illegal, 
	meaning the rules of Khandker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sadaat Mohammad Sayem, 
	and Major General Ziaur Rahman from August 15, 1975 to April 9, 1979 were 
	unlawful. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	In the opinions of the constitutional experts, with the exceptions of those 
	who are either attached to or are obliged to portray the stance of the BNP, 
	the historic judgement has constituted a far-reaching milestone in the 
	nation’s stride for constitutional rule. However, the knee-jerk reactions of 
	the government leaders, especially those who belong to BNP, were both 
	contemptuous and devoid of any logical cogency. Their reactions, on the one 
	hand, included an attempt to absolving their founding leader from the 
	declaration of martial law while, on the other, terming the judgement as 
	‘valueless’, ‘a small part of a large conspiracy’ and so on. The verdict 
	included the observations that martial law as a whole was illegal and 
	unconstitutional and all the actions, laws, and rules made under martial law 
	were illegal. So the changes of the governments between August 15, 1975 and 
	before the national elections of 1991 were not carried out constitutionally.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	The BNP leaders in their reprehensions failed to recognize the rudiment fact 
	that the verdict of the high court was pronounced neither in response to a 
	writ petition by the AL nor the verdict was a political statement made by 
	any AL leaders. The observation is made by the nation’s highest court whose 
	principal responsibility is to interpret the laws and the constitution of 
	the Republic. Transference of the responsibility of the declaration of 
	martial law to some one else does not exonerate any of the three rulers, as 
	quoted in the judgment, regardless of their political affiliations, from the 
	delinquency of promulgation and subsequent execution of the ‘illegal laws 
	and rules’, of the said period. The BNP leaders also failed to take into 
	cognizance of the fact that the so-called ‘sepoy mutiny’, a barbaric act to 
	say the least, or the ‘referendum’ of legalizing an extra-constitutional 
	rule, as indicated in the verdict, is not neither a defined nor a recognized 
	constitutional process. In fact, the current BNP, though founded, in the 
	cognizance of the verdict, by ‘an illegal’ ruler, does not owe anything to 
	his legacy as far as its assumption to the State power at this time is 
	concerned. It could have taken an additional solace from the further 
	observations of the verdict that underscored, “although all government 
	activities between August 15, 1975 and April 9, 1979 have been declared 
	illegal, the history cannot be altered. Many of these illegal acts were done 
	in the public interest. From this perspective, the court 'condones' some of 
	these actions, including the orders cancelling the fourth amendment to the 
	constitution, which could have been done in line with the constitution.”
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	The government had the much-desired opportunity to bolster its faltering 
	image through its absolute indifference to the contents of the verdict since 
	it did not order the government to do anything other than handing over the 
	Moon cinema to the petitioner within a specified period of time. Instead, 
	the government went out of its way to obtain a stay order at midnight, 
	raising the natural query, on the one hand, of the importance of the verdict 
	in the current functioning of the Republic, while on the other, if similar 
	access to the chamber judge could be availed by any other citizen of the 
	Republic at such late hours of night. The law minister, who only on the 
	other day termed the martial law as the ‘laws of the jungle’ now took 
	another U-turn and termed the verdict as ‘valueless’, a highly contemptuous 
	remarks from the government chief spokesperson of the rule of law and the 
	sanctity of the judiciary. According to the news report, the government was 
	looking into the background of the judges whose bench pronounced the 
	verdict. The news report was proven to be true on the following day when, 
	surpassing all records of impropriety, the government sent its Special 
	Branch officials in the nation’s highest court who reportedly insisted to 
	meet one of the justices while he was the midst of a hearing. In spite of 
	attempts at dissuasion, they had their way as the judge came down from the 
	bench to move to his retiring room for a short while and talk. What could 
	have been a more exigent situation that warranted a suo motu order from the 
	Supreme Court? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	As reported in the media the government proposed to provide gun men to the 
	judges, apparently to ensure their security, an unheard of phenomenon in any 
	State, failed or (un)failed. The verdict of the judges was merely an 
	interpretation of the constitution and as such did not involve the 
	indictment or acquittal of any living persons. If it was so, what would the 
	identity of the potential perpetrators who would be emotionally aggrieved 
	enough to mount any attacks on the life of the sitting judges of the 
	nation’s highest court? Even during the tenure of the past government, when 
	one after another, nine judges of our highest court felt ‘embarrassed’ to 
	hear the appeal of the self confessed killers of the nation’s founding 
	father, none of them ever felt threatened to seek any protection from the 
	law enforcing authorities to ensure their security. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Over the last four years of the alliance rule, our judiciary, the last hope 
	of the citizens of a free society, has taken the worst hit in terms of 
	downright politicization, albeit not a single organ of the State has been 
	left unscathed. The current verdict of the high court, notwithstanding the 
	fact that it is very much academic in nature at this time, has emanated a 
	blip of hope in the valley of all out despairs, handing the nation an 
	acutely needed opportunity to re-establish its faltering image to a certain 
	degree, at both home and abroad. However, the government’s hasty actions and 
	the furies of its leaders signal that it is all out there to undo it.</font></p>
