	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Two commissioners appointed to give 
	the CEC majority”, read the headlines of the January 17 issue of the Daily 
	Star. The widely read English Language Daily further reported, “in the wake 
	of an impasse over preparing a fresh voter list, the government in a hasty 
	move yesterday appointed two more election commissioners apparently to win 
	the chief election commissioner (CEC) the majority in the commission.” The 
	‘clever government move’ gave the CEC the much awaited medicine to cure his 
	illness from which he was suffering for thirteen long days since the ruling 
	of a High Court (HC) bench issuing some very common sense directives for the 
	Election Commission (EC) to follow in the preparation of the voter lists. In 
	the wake of the ruling, the CEC was so sick that he was not even able to 
	entertain the telephone calls, a minimum courtesy, from his fellow 
	commissioners who tried unsuccessfully more than once to get through to him! 
	Now through the stroke of a pen of the honourable President of the Republic, 
	who naturally under the advise of the honourable Prime Minister, has 
	appointed two citizens of the Republic as election commissioners and the CEC, 
	himself an honourable judge of the highest court of the Republic has 
	miraculously given himself a clean bill of health to come back to work and 
	hold the much over due meeting, as directed by HC, of the EC to proceed 
	further with his agenda! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The two newly appointed Election 
	Commissioners, the salient features of whose credentials as appeared in the 
	news media are not any different from those of any other appointees, 
	executive or constitutional, under the current government since its 
	inception to the helm of the state some four years ago. Out of the two, one 
	of them was a highly talked-about ‘representative’ of the alternate centre 
	of power in the EC, and was dubbed, obviously, by many as a downright 
	adherent of the ruling alliance. His unflinching loyalty to his appointer 
	was scrupulously reflected in his vituperative, if not virulent, comments 
	about two of his senior colleagues (superiors a few minutes ago) when he 
	said, “they [Munsef Ali and Mohammad Ali] know nothing. They are illiterate. 
	They have tarnished the image of the election commission by talking 
	nonsense, which must be stopped right away.&quot; The other commissioner, who is 
	a retired judge of the HC, reportedly was an active member of the pro-BNP 
	lawyer forum and was rewarded with the appointment when BNP was at the helm 
	of the state in 1992. He, too, spared no time to jump at the fray of 
	criticisms, however, not explicitly directed to his colleagues, but to the 
	HC itself, of which he himself was a honourable judge until 2000. His 
	utterances, vis-à-vis the HC directives to EC, such as, “it's not a High 
	Court directive. It's its certain observations. It's absolutely [self] 
	contradictory and beyond its (the court's) jurisdiction”, challenge the very 
	jurisdiction of the court. The newly appointed commissioner further went on, 
	&quot;since the judgement is not lawful, the question of compliance does not 
	arise.” Here the retired judge portrayed himself as an arbiter, not 
	advocate, to pronounce the HC judgement of a writ of so much national 
	importance as unlawful. If his words carried any substance, then the HC was 
	not empowered with the authority to give any ruling pertaining to the 
	activities of the CEC or the EC for that matter. If that were so, the HC 
	should not have entertained the writ petition in the first place. This is a 
	serious constitutional matter and the nation’s constitutional experts and 
	its highest court should be dealing with it on an urgent basis. If the 
	retired judge, with his newly vested authority has stepped his feet into a 
	no-no territory, the HC, through its power of suo motu should be dealing 
	with the comments, which by all standards are contemptuous of the highest 
	order, to say the least. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The CEC, since his appointment, in 
	the face of the disapproval of the major opposition political parties, as 
	the principal vanguard to carry forward the most vital process of nation’s 
	democratic exercise has been mired with controversial and partisan 
	activities in line with the alleged blue print of ‘election engineering’ by 
	the ruling alliance. One after another, his indiscreet activities and 
	injudicious declarations, rather than alleviating the suspicions of the 
	opposition, have intensified their apprehensions that the CEC is destined to 
	carry out the agenda of the ruling alliance, the least of which is to hold a 
	fair and impartial election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Earlier, the CEC was creative enough 
	to discover 120 or so political parties to invite for dialogues and equated 
	AL, the largest political party of the country, with any other. His comments 
	about the AL were so imprudent that even it generated an irked advice from a 
	leader of a component of the ruling alliance during his meeting with him. 
	Even the PM, in her recent effort to stage a dialogue to tackle the national 
	crisis, could not find more than two dozens political parties that would 
	matter. The CEC went out of his way to support the appointment of the BNP 
	cadres as the Upazila election officers by the PSC, believed to be a far 
	fetched evil design of the government to implement its master plan of 
	‘election engineering’, as alleged by the opposition. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For long, it has been a national 
	consensus to make the EC independent from the executive branch of the state, 
	especially to make it free from the clutches of the PM’s office. The HC has 
	already issued a rule (January 2, 2006) on the government and the EC asking 
	them to explain why the functioning of EC Secretariat under the jurisdiction 
	of Prime Minister's Office will not be declared illegal. The HC ruling went 
	further by asking them to explain in three weeks why government's 
	formulation of rules for the EC will not be declared illegal and 
	unconstitutional as the Constitution and the Representation of the People 
	Order 1972 empower the EC to formulate its rules. Notwithstanding the 
	aforesaid HC ruling, the opinions of a few former revered CECs and the 
	common sense observations of the citizens from all spectrums of the nation 
	about the lack of independence of the EC, the CEC went out of his way once 
	again to declare that he did not find any lack of independence of the EC 
	under its present structure. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The CEC was not at all perturbed by 
	the news report that the ruling alliance cadres have been delegated to make 
	the new voter list, which he, disregarding the stiff opposition from the 
	other two election commissioners, initiated. An observation of the HC, a 
	part of the ruling of January 4, 2006, reiterated, “a fair voter list is the 
	prerequisite of a free and fair election and if any confusion is created in 
	public mind in this regard, the EC will be considered to have failed in 
	discharging its constitutional duties.” Notwithstanding the very explicit 
	ruling of the nation’s highest court, given in a very transparent and 
	unambiguous terms, the CEC, still a judge of the appellate division of the 
	supreme court chose to ignore and defy the directives. In the pretext of the 
	so-called illness, he was allegedly working behind the curtain to collude 
	with the government to appoint the two new commissioners to hand him the 
	majority in the commission to carry forward with his agenda. With a 
	dysfunctional parliament, a partisan President in the helm of the state, a 
	controversial to be chief of the future CTG and the PM’s refusal even to 
	discuss the opposition’s reform proposals as regard to the EC and the CTG, 
	the democracy in Bangladesh was already on notice to get ready of its 
	burial. With the appointment of two extremely partisan election 
	commissioners, believed to be in collusion with the CEC, the government has 
	hammered the last nail in the coffin of democracy. The CEC, with his newly 
	acquired majority in the EC and its unchallenged indemnity to defy the 
	ruling of the HC, is in the commanding seat to steer through all his ideas 
	and plans, which he alone considers lawful and appropriate for the benefit 
	of the nation’s arduous journey through the process of democracy! At the 
	end, it all boils down to the ordeal of how deviously the citizens of the 
	Republic, in particular, and the international community, at large, could be 
	fooled by the CEC and his patrons.</font></p>
