	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-CA">Thanks 
	are due to law adviser Mainul Hosein who has at last candidly expressed an 
	apprehension that the current CTG might fail and warned <span class="bd1">
	<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">all concerned to think about the 
	consequences should the government fail. However, instead of soul searching, 
	the adviser, in his usual style, has relocated the blames onto others. The 
	adviser went on to say, “it is the responsibility of the people in every 
	sector to help the government…But I find a lack of consciousness among the 
	intellectuals and the media people. They are not playing the role we expect 
	of them.” </span></span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="bd1">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="bd1">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">I am not sure how 
	much time the adviser devotes to read what are being ceaselessly written in 
	country’s news media by the columnists and editors of most of the credible 
	news dailies. On January 11, this government took over the rein of the 
	country not only with the backing of the Armed Forces but enjoying an 
	overwhelming support of the masses who did not want the scheduled one-sided 
	election of January 22 go through. It enjoyed the whole hearted support of 
	the columnists, news media and the members of the civil society who were 
	fighting tooth and nail against holding a farcical election as nefariously 
	planned by the then four party alliance. Never before since the first 
	government right after the victory of our liberation war, any government 
	enjoyed such good will of the masses and the media. Regrettably, only after 
	only 200 or so days it is no one but the self-assumed chief spokesperson of 
	this government himself had to issue the warning of failure. The realization 
	no matter however late is commendable but the responsibility is misplaced. 
	Ironically, the handful of columnists who were blindly in favour of holding 
	the January 22 election in the pretext of constitutional continuity have 
	metamorphosed themselves, over the last few months, into sycophantic 
	supporters of the government, in addition to some members of the so-called 
	16<sup>th</sup> division who kept themselves on the sideline during the 
	atrocious rule and the diabolical plans of electoral rigging of the last 
	government, while the erstwhile propitiators for creating a level playing 
	field before holding an election have become sceptics. The reasons are 
	multi-folds.</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="bd1">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="bd1">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Firstly, the 
	government actions in many cases are mired in lack of transparency and 
	accountability. These actions of the government have even impelled the US 
	charge d’ affairs suggesting ensuring that the corruption cases were 
	prosecuted fairly, transparently and without ‘selectivity or political 
	motivation</span><span lang="EN-CA">.’</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp; 
	Following the arrest of Sheikh Hasina on July 16 on charge of so-called 
	extortion which the law adviser himself had earlier termed ‘peculiar’ and 
	posed the question </span></span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color: #333333">
	&quot;why such a case will be filed against a former prime minister?”, the Daily 
	Star Editor Mahfuz Anam in his splendid commentary noting in point blank 
	(“for we think by arresting Sheikh Hasina …, the government has put at risk 
	all its achievements of the last six months”) the misguided agenda of the 
	government with the clear warning that “the fundamental mistake committed by 
	past proponents of &quot;command politics&quot; was to underestimate the wisdom of our 
	masses.” Notwithstanding&nbsp; such a bold warning from the country’s most 
	prestigious English Daily, how the honourable adviser can blame the media 
	and the intellectuals of their lack of consciousness? The adviser must have 
	also come across with the grim concerns his friend Rashid Suhrawrdy has 
	expressed in his article in DS. In any governance where an iota of 
	accountability and respect for the media exist, Mahfuz Anam’s commentary 
	(many of our compatriots foresee it to be considered a milestone in our 
	political history when the dusts settle) would certainly generate a response 
	from the government. Just like any other government in the past, it did not 
	happen. Yet, the law adviser lectured on “</span><span class="e11"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">to 
	establish a justice-based nation”</span></span><span class="bd1"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
	and asked the media and the intellectuals to point out their mistakes in 
	order for them to come out of any of their impending failures.</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="bd1">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="bd1">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Secondly, the law 
	adviser “</span></span><span class="e11"><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">wants 
	to run the government honestly abiding by laws so that an example could be 
	created.” Would it be worth emulating example of ‘abiding by laws’ the 
	honourable adviser, to deploy more than a thousand members of the law 
	enforcing agencies, some of them wearing bullet proof vest, with dog squads 
	to arrest a </span></span><span lang="EN-CA">unarmed near-60-year-old woman 
	isolated in her home<span class="e11"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
	and a democratically elected former PM at wee hours of night without any 
	warrant of arrest from the court of law? It was the mighty reflection of the 
	law of forces, not the force of law that the CTG is oath-bound to uphold.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	&nbsp;However, if this is the law of the land, then it must be abrogated in haste 
	if we are aspiring to promote ourselves in the community of civilized 
	nations. </span></span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="e11">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="e11">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Thirdly, the law 
	adviser accused the media for keeping themselves busy with the politicians 
	and lectured on upholding some values, a precondition for establishing a 
	‘just-based nation.” If one goes through the media briefings of the law 
	adviser, quite a contrary situation would emerge. It is the honourable 
	adviser who availed every opportunity to lecture the nation on the quality 
	of a ‘good politician’ and which leaders should be discarded for what 
	reasons, not only a clear overstepping of his boundary, but a blatant 
	violation of the oath of office which he solemnly made by affirming, </span>
	</span><span lang="EN-CA">“I will do right to all manner of people according 
	to law, without fear of favour, affection or ill-will.&quot;</span><span lang="EN-CA" style="color: teal">
	</span><span class="e11">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;The soft corner of 
	the government as a whole has been revealed in clear term for a party which, 
	notwithstanding, did not possess the records of quite an honourable past. 
	Moreover, it behaved more of a catholic than the Pope in the fiery 
	determination of its leader to go ahead with the de-railed January 22 
	election. Nevertheless the general secretary of that party was allowed to 
	leave the country while a former PM was not allowed to go out of the country 
	although cases of similar nature were lodged against both of them. Still two 
	advisers of the CTG merely shrugged it off as not a ‘double standard’. This 
	list could go on.</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="e11">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="e11">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Fourthly, 
	‘selectivity and political motivation’ of the government actions have been 
	so much self-evident as it seems that Sheikh Hasina was the immediate past 
	PM and her government was responsible for the most despicable governance 
	this country has ever experienced, her party colleagues are the ones 
	responsible for reckless looting and plundering national wealth in the last 
	five years and her political alliance’s ‘irresponsible acts’ led to the 
	declaration of emergency. This sort of selectivity in particular has created 
	rooms for speculations that led the political analysts to put forward 
	hypotheses, regrettably, not very&nbsp; much in conformity with the well meaning 
	intention of the January eleven takeover.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="e11">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span class="e11">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman">It is an open fact 
	that it is the credibility of the (the use of adjective ‘patriotic’ is not 
	only redundant but the worst form of sycophantism) Armed Forces of the 
	country that is at stake in the success and failure of this government. God 
	forbid, if its mission plunges in disarray, as has been apprehended by the 
	law adviser, it is the leaders of the Armed Forces who have to bear the 
	burnt. The advisers neither have any election mandate nor do have any 
	constituency to lean onto. They might share the credit, if any, but do not 
	have to partake the burden of failures since they are virtually no one so 
	far the people of the country are concerned. It may not be too late for the 
	power behind the throne to re-inscribe the obvious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
