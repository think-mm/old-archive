	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is now clear that the government 
	has negotiated with the BNP chairperson that she would leave the country 
	with her second son and other family members at any time (if it has not 
	happened already). At the same time government has issued a press note of 
	strong warning to the AL chief Sheikh Hasina not to return to the country 
	with a clear indication that she would be taken into custody upon her 
	arrival to any entry point of the country. These rumours of sending out the 
	two leaders were floating in the air since the declaration of emergency on 
	January 11. There were conflicting and at times, very unambiguous statements 
	from mostly two advisers of the current CTG about the fate of the two former 
	prime ministers, both of whom were elected through free and fair elections. 
	There are many queries that need to be addressed vis-à-vis the actions of 
	the government in this regard. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Firstly, why a citizen of a 
	civilized country, let alone the former elected PMs will be either forced 
	out of the country or will be barred from coming back to the country? If 
	Khaleda Zia has done anything unlawful during her tenure as PM, as is widely 
	believed, she should be facing an open court where the law of the land will 
	decide the validity of the allegations and if she is indicted, she should be 
	serving her sentence in the country’s prison, just like any other citizen of 
	the Republic. Since the proclamation of emergency, Khaleda Zia has never 
	publicly uttered a single word neither against the emergency nor against the 
	actions of the CTG. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The case of Sheikh Hasina, however, 
	is totally different. For the last two years or so, she has spearheaded the 
	political movement for reform of the Election Commission and the electoral 
	process and tried to avail all political and peaceful means, from parliament 
	to parleys, to compel the then ruling alliance to meet their demands, which 
	the current reformed CEC has spelled out as its primary goal. Her 
	conditional acceptance of the Professor Iazudddin’s assumption of the Chief 
	Adviser to CTG, in clear violation of the constitution, reflected her 
	statesmanship and muted her critics when she was accused of intransigency. 
	It is paradoxical that the government’s press note indicted her of carrying 
	out ‘non-stop street protest’. It is only natural to ask how the birth of 
	the current CTG would be possible without her alleged ‘irresponsible 
	agitation and disorderly acts’, a conventional political program in 
	Bangladesh. Were there any other means available to Sheikh Hasina to derail 
	the proposed January 22 farcical election? Did any one have any second 
	thought about the identity of the would be PM of the country if the January 
	22 election would go through? The current CTG should be grateful to Sheikh 
	Hasina and her alliance’s actions and sacrifices which have given the 
	opportunity for the CTG to carry out the reforms in tune with the wishes of 
	the people. Before leaving for US, Sheikh Hasina has even pledged to give 
	legal cover for the multi-prone reforms which are being implemented by the 
	CTG if her party is voted to power. Her observation of terming the CTG 
	‘unconstitutional and undemocratic’ warranted a legal and constitutional 
	explanation from the government rather than entertaining allegation of 
	extortion against her, that only provoked ridicules, and charges of murder 
	in a political program, which was an absolute mockery of justice. In fact, 
	it is extremely confusing to note the comment of the law adviser when he 
	says, “this government is supported by the armed forces”, disregarding the 
	fact the armed forces is an integral part of the government, not the other 
	way around. Is it not trespassing to make the comments that ‘election will 
	not be held until the top leadership’ of the political parties are changed?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Since its initiation on ‘one eleven’, CTG headed by Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, a 
	man impeccable record, the nation breathed a sigh of relief for saving the 
	nation from impending catastrophe due to the intransigence of the BNP 
	alliance. However, it would be a sheer lack of acumen to take their support 
	for granted, since support of the people is never static. Democratic reforms 
	do not entail any one to reinvent the wheel of democracy. The experiences of 
	our people in that regard are not very sweet either. General Moeen’s 
	suggestion on April 2 ‘to construct our own brand of democracy’ is alarming 
	not only for its content, but also because of the chequered past of a few 
	around the seminar, in their opposition to reform movement, they were more 
	catholic than then Pope, notably among them was the presiding officer (my 
	college mate) of the congregation, who as an active member of the infamous 
	Ayub-Monem’s students group NSF, was a vocal supporter of their own brand of 
	democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The proclamation of emergency had 
	created a new era of opportunity for the nation to reform not only the 
	electoral process but the political parties as well. However, this reform 
	must come from within the party itself. It can never be imposed from 
	outside. The anti-corruption drive initiated by the government has the broad 
	mass support, albeit the process must be more transparent and the due 
	process of the rule of law must be upheld. Moreover, anti-corruption drive 
	is not a five or ten year crush program; it is an ongoing process. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The nation could not agree more with 
	General Moeen when he talks about the national unity. In the last three 
	successive elections, Sheikh Hasina and Khaled Zia garnered more than 80 
	percent support of our people, although Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia should 
	never be considered two sides of the same coin. In the last five years of 
	unprecedented misrule, the support for Khaleda Zia and her party might have 
	dwindled but the same is not true for Sheikh Hasina. Moreover, bulk of 
	Sheikh Hasina’s supports come from the section of our people with firm 
	convictions about the values that her party nourishes and represents, in 
	spite of many lapses; the virtues that led us to carry through the struggle 
	with the culmination of the great war of liberation. It is beyond 
	comprehension how the much-desired national unity could be achieved by 
	forcibly driving them out of the country. If they are guilty of breaking any 
	law, they must be tried in the court of law. Barring their presence in their 
	homeland will least serve the cause of democracy, let alone the national 
	unity. Are we on the verge of missing yet another opportunity? </font></p>
