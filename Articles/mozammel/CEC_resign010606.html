	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;<font face="Verdana">Much have been written and 
	talked about the resignations of the CEC and his ‘partners of the crime’, 
	especially following the verdict of the full bench of the appellate division 
	of the Supreme Court. Two options were discussed regarding freeing the 
	Election Commission (EC) from the grapple of its current occupants: 
	voluntary resignations of the trio or their removal by the Supreme Judicial 
	Council (SJC). Voluntary resignations in most cases happened from ethical 
	consideration while the removal by the SJC comes under gross misconduct of 
	which ethics is certainly an important component. The CEC and his fellow 
	commissioner could likely be charged with five fundamental offences: 
	firstly, unethical conduct, secondly, fraudulent practices, thirdly, 
	breaking the oath of office, fourthly, illegal actions and finally, 
	deliberate misappropriation of monetary resources from the national 
	exchequer. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In philosophy, ethics defines what 
	is good for the individual and for society and establishes the nature of 
	duties that people owe themselves and one another. Though law often embodies 
	ethical principals, law and ethics are far from coextensive. However, as 
	there is a difference between law and ethics, just as there is a clear 
	relationship between the two. As US Supreme Court Chief Justice, Earl 
	Warren, observed nearly 40 years ago: ‘Law floats on a sea of ethics’. Such 
	an observation broadens the periphery of ethics far beyond the jurisdiction 
	of law. Obviously, the CEC and his cohorts have conducted themselves 
	unethically on many counts since his appointment to this position as the 
	principal vanguard to carry forward the most vital process of nation’s 
	democratic exercise. Following the HC verdict of January 4, 2006, in the 
	pretext of the so-called illness, he was allegedly working behind the 
	curtain to collude with the government to appoint the two new commissioners 
	to hand him the majority in the commission to carry forward with his 
	personal agenda, a grim example of his unethical act. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In all matured democracies, as in 
	Canada, there exists a constitutional post of ethics commissioner who is 
	empowered to investigate any allegedly unethical conduct of any 
	constitutional appointee, including the PM and the Governor General, and the 
	recommendation of the commissioner has an implicit binding on the executive 
	organ of the State. In the absence of such an authority, the resignation of 
	CEC and the other two ECs, no matter how strong is the demand from the 
	people, is absolutely dependant on their own conscience and ethical 
	standard. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The next offence, namely the 
	fraudulent practices of creating 15 to 20 million fictitious voters, was so 
	wide spread that it filled the pages of the news media in vivid details over 
	the last few weeks. However, publications of these detailed and specific 
	deceptive practices of the EC failed to perturb the CEC and his colleagues 
	even an iota. In fact, the CEC and the ECs tried to shield themselves from 
	the public media in such a way as if they were working for a highly 
	sensitive project of the Defence department. In addition to that, it came to 
	public disclosure of how the CEC resorted to deceitful practices in dealing 
	with the opinions and assertions of two of the recently retired ECs. 
	According to disclosures of those two erstwhile ECs, the CEC distorted the 
	content of the Minutes of EC meeting in which he fraudulently included that 
	a decision was taken to make the new voter list. In reality, both the ECs 
	had opined for updating the 2001 voter list and as such, both of them gave 
	notes of dissent to the file containing the Minutes of the meeting. 
	Nevertheless, the CEC’s lawyer has repeatedly presented to the court that a 
	decision to make the new voter list was taken (implied consensus) in the EC 
	meeting. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The third offence was breaking of 
	the oath of office. The oath avouches, “I … do solemnly swear (or Affirm) 
	that I will faithfully discharge the duties of my office according to law: 
	That I will bear true faith and allegiance to Bangladesh: That I will 
	preserve, protect and defend the Constitution: And that I will not allow my 
	personal interest to influence my official conduct or my official 
	decisions.&quot; Here again, defying the notes of dissent of the other two ECs, 
	the CEC through his lone decision appointed hundreds of assistant 
	registration officers, supervisors and enumerators from the ruling alliance 
	cadres to create the coveted new voter list with the sole purpose of helping 
	his appointers to carry out the alleged election engineering. In the face of 
	the severe criticisms from the media of these partisan appointments, the CEC 
	publicly defended his decision shrugging off with the comment, ‘so what if 
	they are partisan, they are qualified’. Taking cue from the ruling party 
	stalwarts, he blasted the media for destroying country’s image and termed 
	the EC as merely a post box. In the first by-election held under his 
	leadership, in response to the complaints made personally by the apparently 
	defeated candidate the CEC's comments that, &quot;I do not have miracle power to 
	redress the situation&quot; only reflected the synchronization of his words with 
	his deeds. However, if the CEC had a little time to go back to the pages of 
	history, he would have discovered a decision by a CEC named M Abu Hena, who 
	not only exercised his constitutional, not miracle, power to withhold the 
	result of a by-election contested by Kader Siddiqui against the then ruling 
	party candidate, but also initiated executive and legal action against the 
	returning officer. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fourth offence is the flagrant 
	violation of the electoral rolls rules, which do not authorize the EC to 
	make new voter list before every general election. The Honourable HC in its 
	judgement on January 4 interpreted the law, which was subsequently upheld by 
	the Nation’s highest court. In this part of the offence, two questions arose 
	vis-à-vis the conduct of the EC. Firstly, they deliberately defied the law 
	and secondly they wilfully contemned the directives of the court. For 
	defiance of the directive of the court, the CEC and ECs have been already 
	issued with a contempt ruling by the honourable HC. For defiance of law, an 
	important element of gross misconduct, the constitution empowers the SJC 
	(consists of CJ and two other senior judges), which according to Article 
	96(5) of the constitution says, “Where, upon any information received from 
	the Council or from any other source, the President has reason to apprehend 
	that a Judge (ECs are also in that category) - (a) may have ceased to be 
	capable of properly performing the functions of his office by reason of 
	physical or mental incapacity, or (b) may have been guilty of gross 
	misconduct, the President may direct the Council to inquire into the matter 
	and report its finding.” However, Article 48(3) of the constitution 
	restricts the power of President when it affirms, “in the exercise of all 
	his functions, save only that of appointing the Prime Minister pursuant to 
	clause (3) of article 56 and the Chief Justice pursuant to clause (1) of 
	article 95, the President shall act in accordance with the advice of the 
	Prime Minister.” The current extremely partisan President (I wish him well) 
	is following this clause of the constitution in its letter, not spirit. This 
	was reflected in his utterly indecent written speech in the august 
	parliament where he mentioned the name of the founding father of our nation 
	as ‘Mujibur Rahman’ instead of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (to even his greatest 
	detractor he was known as Sheikh Shaheb’), albeit I did not want him to be 
	shown the door for adding the widely used appellation Bangabandhu in front 
	of his name. In the same token, as the titular Head of State, he also, like 
	the CEC, could not spare a few minutes of his time to give an audience to 
	two outgoing ECs, both of whom had diligently served the nation for five 
	long years. The fifth offence is the wilful misappropriation of the 
	resources of the national exchequer to serve the vested interest. This act 
	was not an error of judgement; it was deliberately done with the intent to 
	achieve an evil objective. In the words of the former EC Mr. A K Mohammed 
	Ali, “I am expressing with heavy heart that the CEC and the other two ECs, 
	being the vanguard of the sacred and high powered Institution, through their 
	illegal activities have misappropriated such a huge amount of money of our 
	poor people. I am demanding with the clear term that the legal action must 
	be initiated against them for their illegal activities” (Prothom Alo, May 
	25, 2006). If SJC is the only body that could initiate investigation, it has 
	to depend on the President’s assent, which would be forthcoming if only the 
	PM advises him to do so. However, the BNP Secretary General does not 
	consider anything wrong (!) that the CEC and his colleagues have done to 
	warrant their resignations. Moreover, the appointment of the CEC and the 
	other two highly partisan commissioners were made at the advice of the PM, 
	allegedly with an ulterior motive to influence the outcome of the next 
	general election and they, accordingly, have, as a team, tried to meet that 
	end. One would be living in fool’s paradise if he expects that the PM will 
	order an SJC investigation against her own men. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In these scenario, the concerned 
	citizens of the republic in general and the opposition political parties in 
	particular are not left with any other options but to resort to street 
	demonstrations to free the EC from the clutches of the people who have lost 
	all their moral right and credibility to hold on to their positions. This 
	surly will result in more violence, hartal, and losses of human lives, 
	private and State properties in coming days. When (not if) that happens who 
	would be responsible for that catastrophic eventualities?</font></p>
