	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On September 11, 2005, the Premier 
	of Ontario, Canada's largest province, emphatically declared: &quot;Ontario will 
	reject the use of Shariah law and will move to prohibit all religious-based 
	tribunals to settle family disputes such as divorce.&quot; Sharia Court in 
	Toronto, Canada, was the first legal one in Western soil because of 
	political Islam's global ploy that the West was unaware of. His announcement 
	came after hundreds of demonstrators around the world protested a proposal 
	to let Ontario residents use Islamic law for settling family disputes.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, the fight between the 
	proponents and opponents of the introduction of Shariah law in Ontario, 
	Canada, has been going on since 2003 when a group of Islamic clerics led by 
	a Pakistani-born lawyer who set up a so-called &quot;Darul Kada&quot; (House of 
	Justice) in Ontario and subsequently appealed to the Ontario government to 
	give Darul Kada the arbitration power to settle the disputed among the 
	muslims. The word Shariah means &quot;the path to a watering hole.&quot; To its 
	proponents it denotes an Islamic way of life. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is indeed a matter of great pride 
	for the secularist Bangladeshi Muslims that the theological fight against 
	the introduction of Shariah law was largely led by the Muslim Canadian 
	Congress with its Director of Sharia Law, a Bangladesh born scholar, who 
	conducted extensive research to portray, to the Muslims and non-Muslims 
	alike, around the globe that very little of what is termed as Shariah is 
	divine order. The name of this humble man is Hasan Mahmud who resides in the 
	outskirts of Toronto. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hasan Mahmud participated in scores 
	of global TV and radio debates and international conferences,
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/jamal_hasan/debate_Qamruzzaman_fatemolla191206.html">
	the most recent of which was conducted over the phones by the Voice of 
	America</a> on January 18 against Jamaaat-e-Islami's Assistant Secretary 
	General<b> Mr. Kamruzzaman</b>, scoring important points over his opponents 
	who are bent on introducing Shariah law, in any society they rule or reside.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His numerous citations from the 
	authentic documents manuscripted by learned Islamic theologians from across 
	the globe have dispelled many of the myths of Shariah and have, in fact, 
	glorified the great religion, where the Holy Qur'an is believed to reign 
	over any other directives or declarations. A few very common and detrimental 
	anomalies, as cited by Hasan Mahmud through his tenacious research on the 
	Shariah law which most of the common people fallaciously perceive as 
	directives from the Qur'an, in the Shariah law as compiled by the Bangladesh 
	Islamic Foundation under the title <i>Bidhibaddha Islami Ain</i> (BIA, 
	Islamic laws) could be summarized as follows:<br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Shariah laws clearly do not 
	place men and women on level ground in seeking justice, acting as witness, 
	in inheritance and divorce. According to BIA, a husband can instantly 
	divorce his wife where witness is not a pre-requisite. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the contrary, the Qur'an in Sura 
	Baqarah in Verses 228-229 and Sura Talaqh Verses 1-2, clearly states: &quot;When 
	ye do divorce women, divorce them at their prescribed period and count 
	(accurately) their prescribed period (that delays finality of divorce for at 
	least two months) and take for witnesses two persons from among you.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Likewise, Article 576, Volume 2 of 
	BIA cites: &quot;Women's witness is not acceptable in hudad (killing, robbery, 
	adultery, etc) and kisas (eye for and eye, etc) cases.&quot; This is in direct 
	violation of verse 283 of sura Baqarah where it is affirmed: &quot;conceal not 
	evidences, for whoever conceals it, his heart is tainted.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Regarding dispensing justice for 
	killing of human beings, BIA in its Article 56, Volume 1, attests: &quot;If a 
	mulsim kills a non-muslim and non-muslim kills a muslim, in either case, the 
	killer must be given the capital punishment.&quot; However, Articles 914c and 64 
	of the third volume of BIA claims: &quot;If the head of state kills anyone or if 
	anyone kills his son, daughter or grandchildren, then the killers must not 
	be given the capital punishment.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, the Penal Law of 
	Islam on page 149 declares: &quot;In an Islamic state, no muslim should be given 
	capital punishment for killing a non-muslim.&quot; Bokhari in Hadith 283 of 
	Volume 4 supports the above dictum when it says: &quot;A muslim must not be given 
	capital punishment for killing a non-believer.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In contrast, the Qur'an is very 
	explicit in its declaration in Verse 33 of Sura Bani Israel where it was 
	revealed: &quot;Nor take life -- which God has made sacred -- except for just 
	cause&quot; and Verse 178 of Sura Baqarah which states: &quot;The law of equality is 
	prescribed to you in case of murder.&quot; No exception has been granted in the 
	Qur'an so far as the punishment for taking an innocent human life is 
	concerned. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One very despicable phenomenon that 
	is mostly prevalent in Bangladesh that a few clerics very often declare a 
	muslim as murtad (some who has renounced his faith) citing the violation of 
	specific Shariah law by the victim and promulgate a unilateral death 
	sentence to him. It is obvious that a person himself can only renounce his 
	own faith. It is like committing suicide. No one from outside can shoulder 
	that responsibility. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Qur'an in this case clearly 
	indicated in Sura Nisaa, Verse 94: &quot;And say not to any one who offers you a 
	salutation: thou art none of a believer!&quot; Verse 137 of Sura Nisaa went 
	further by declaring: &quot;Surely those who believe then reject faith, then 
	believe again and again reject faith, and go on increasing in unbelief, God 
	will not forgive them nor guide them.&quot; This verse clearly directs the 
	believer neither to proclaim any one murtad nor to take the law in one's own 
	hand to deal with the so-called murtad.<br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Qur'an is one out of at least 
	ten sources of Shariah law and it deals with only a very little segment of 
	it. However, the Qur'an itself in Verse 9 of Sura Hijr describes itself as a 
	&quot;book of advice,&quot; and as such, each verse of it may not be deemed to be a 
	directive. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Qur'an deals with only five 
	areas, where as the Shafi and the Hanafi books alone contain more than six 
	thousand laws. The laws illustrated by five madhabs (school of thoughts) are 
	numerous and in many cases they contradict each other. The existence of 
	different school of thoughts itself amplifies that there are hardly any 
	universality in them. In fact, Shariah law has, in many instances, tarnished 
	the universalism of the Qur'an by indulging itself in contradictory 
	interpretations. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Moreover, Sura Gashiya's verses 21, 
	22 of the Qur'an revealed, indicating to Prophet (SM): &quot;Therefore do thou 
	give admonition, for thou art one to admonish. Thou art not one to manage 
	affairs.&quot; The similar messages were delivered twenty eight times in the 
	Qur'an where it was revealed: &quot;I sent messengers only to convey my messages 
	of fear (to those who reject truth) and good news to the mankind.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For these reasons, probably, none of 
	the preachers of Islam ever applied Shariah law and the four Jurist Imams 
	never called their legal opinions &quot;God's Law.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The major concern of people critical 
	of Shariah law is that it is extremely anti-women and subject to 
	uncontrolled interpretation and evolution. There is virtually no formal 
	certification process to designate someone as being qualified to interpret 
	Islamic law. As it stands today, almost anyone can make rulings as long as 
	they have the appearance of piety and a group of followers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[Hasan Mahmud's Bangla website: 
	BanglarIslam.com is a great source of most authentic Islamic documents about 
	Sharia.] </font></p>
