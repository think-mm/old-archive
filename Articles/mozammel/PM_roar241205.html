	<span lang="EN-CA">In any democracy, politics is all about scoring political 
	points. In a nascent democracy, it is more so for the fact that success of a 
	politician largely depends on how adeptly one could fool his/her 
	constituents. In Bangladesh’s political landscape, this perception has 
	become more obvious in recent weeks in the backdrop of the PM’s letter to 
	the opposition political parties inviting them to sit for dialogues with the 
	intention to contrive a strategy to fight the recent spate of terrorist 
	attacks all across the country. Did the PM really believe that the 
	opposition would extend an olive branch in response to her invitation? The 
	answer is a big nay. Her sole objective was to score some political points. 
	The stage was skilfully set with all those, which were required to meet that 
	end. Score of journalists and TV crews were available on the spot when a 
	very low ranking official from the PM’s office came to the house of leader 
	of the opposition to deliver the letter of invitation. It was shown on TV 
	camera how impolite it was on the part of the opposition leader that a 
	(probably) servant of the house was there in front of the TV camera to tell 
	the letter carrier that there was no one in the house to receive the letter. 
	The government was fully successful in devising a perfect script and it 
	surely did score a few political points. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">However, the vantage of the government ended as soon as 
	the leader of her loyal opposition, Kader Siddiqui met with the PM and, in 
	line with most of the reliable media reports, squarely pointed his finger, 
	supposedly, towards the most important partner of the BNP in the coalition 
	government as the mastermind of the bomb attacks. The accusation of Kader 
	Siddiqui took the government off guard. The government made it imperative 
	that in any future dialogue with any opposition political party, who chooses 
	to respond positively, either through free will or by compulsion, no one 
	repeats the accusation. It was stringently maintained when the fallen 
	dictator, who allegedly had to divorce his young wife due to government’s 
	instigation, has been instructed by the PM’s office not to table the 
	accusation similar to the one laid out by Kader Siddiqui. With a dozen of 
	corruption cases hanging against him, the fallen dictator chose not risk his 
	freedom at this stage of the dialogue drama.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">If one goes through the opinions and commentaries as 
	published in the country’s printed &nbsp;news media, two clearly opposing views 
	have emerged vis-à-vis the necessity of a dialogue between the government 
	and the opposition. On one side, there were unconditional pro-dialogue views 
	largely expressed by those who so far were solidly behind the government in 
	denying the international media reports starting from Bertil Lintner’s 
	‘Bangladesh: A cocoon of terror’ to Eliza Griswold’s ‘The next Islamic 
	Revolution?”. They, in most cases, concurred with the government views in 
	blaming the opposition politicians and the secular intellectuals, both at 
	home and abroad, for their part in collaborating with those reporters with 
	the intention to tarnish the image of the country. In the home front, the 
	government spared no time in blaming the opposition and taking many of the 
	politicians and freethinking intellectuals into custody following any bomb 
	attacks, notwithstanding the fact that the attacks were &nbsp;targeted towards 
	the opposition rallies, personalities and the secular institutions. Only 
	after the unprecedented and simultaneous bomb attacks, not specifically 
	targeted towards the opposition, on August 17 in the 63 out 64 
	administrative districts of the country, the government did not directly 
	blame or arrest any of the opposition activists. However, the vocabularies 
	of the PM and a few other government leaders have been still lurking around 
	the ‘conspiracy to tarnish the image of the country’, ‘to make the country a 
	failed state’ or ‘to stop the country’s progress and development’, the terms 
	which are exclusively reserved for the main opposition, since the beginning 
	of its inception to the helm of the government. The militants, who are bent 
	on sacrificing their lives, are not making any bones to hide their intention 
	to transform Bangladesh into a theocratic Islamic state of their own 
	thought. The word ‘image’, tarnishing or edifying, is probably the last 
	thing in their mind since they are hardly worried about what the rest of the 
	world would think about their coveted State. It is not only that the bulk of 
	our people despise their objective, they abhor the violent means they are 
	using to meet that end and want the government to deal with them and to 
	bring them to proper justice. Does the government need any help from the 
	opposition to deal with the situation, which the government itself has 
	termed a ‘national crisis’?&nbsp; One must take into cognizance of the fact that 
	the crisis is an internal one and has been imposed upon the State by its own 
	citizens, notwithstanding the probable support of some external groups, not 
	of any State. The nation has not been subjected to any external aggression.

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">Here comes the other school of thoughts that labels the 
	proposed dialogue--a futile exercise. In a working democracy, to deal with 
	any national crisis, the best forum to discuss the issue is the parliament, 
	where the government can solicit support from the opposition to pass any new 
	law to deal with the crisis. However, with a dysfunctional parliament, where 
	even the carnage of August 21 was not considered serious enough to warrant 
	any discussions, and a huge numerical strength of the ruling coalition, the 
	government can pass any law and even can amend the constitution, as it 
	desires, without the support of the opposition. Other than criticizing or 
	supporting any enactment of a new law, the opposition has hardly any say or 
	control in the any of the following three broad steps required to be 
	undertaken to bring any of the perpetrators to justice. Firstly, it is the 
	members of the law enforcing authority, who decide who to arrest. It is the 
	public prosecutors, who decide whose bail petition has to be opposed.&nbsp; 
	Secondly, it is the investigating team who decides which material and other 
	evidences have to be used to frame a charge.&nbsp; It is only they, who decide 
	how strong a charge sheet should be or under which criminal code the charge 
	has to be framed.&nbsp; Although, one of the leading accused publicly disclosed 
	their determination (on TV) to throw away the constitution of the Republic, 
	no sedition charge has been brought against any of them.&nbsp; Finally, it is the 
	judges of the court, who would dispense the justice in accordance with the 
	strength of the charge sheet, validity of the evidences and in line with the 
	demand and argument of the public prosecutors. Each element of this system 
	has been absolutely politicized under the present administration and, at 
	this time, is under the full control of the chief executive of the Sate, the 
	PM. In addition, when the PM publicly reaffirmed her determination to keep 
	her four party alliance intact, the whole&nbsp; system gets the message who 
	should not be implicated in the process. The opposition could have scored a 
	few important political points by explaining these to the members of the 
	public and by demanding judicial investigations of each case by a tribunal 
	whose members had to be chosen through national consensus and the subsequent 
	public trials of the accused. A case in demand could have been to 
	interrogate publicly the former SP of Rajshahi whose action of providing 
	escort to Bangla Bhai and his entourage in their highly publicised parading 
	of the city street that made international headlines.&nbsp; All these obvious 
	demands would have acted as a two-way sword for the government. If the media 
	reports and the PM’s conversations with the editor of a Bangla Daily had to 
	be believed, one would find merit in the opposition’s accusation that the PM 
	knew all about it and that she was under the assurance that they would never 
	go out of her control. It was fine with her as long as they were directing 
	their violent activities towards her archrivals and none of these activities 
	was ever directed to BNP and its allies. </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">The political points that could have been easily bagged 
	by the opposition without even participating in the dialogue has been given 
	back to the opposition fold by the PM through her roaring speech of 
	desperation as uttered in the public meeting on December 21 at the Paltan 
	maidan. The fiery speech reflected multiple dimensions. Firstly, it has 
	exposed the lack of goodwill that was expected from the PM of a nation that 
	has fallen into a ‘national crisis’ due to government’s inaction, if not 
	encouragement. Secondly, it has disappointed the nation that had expected a 
	conciliatory tone from the PM to invoke the opposition to reciprocate. 
	Thirdly, it reflected a complete lack of perception of the PM of the history 
	of the democratic struggle of the land, which incidentally, she now rules. 
	What the PM needed around her, at this time, was a group of friends, not 
	sycophants, who would dare to feed her with the real picture of the most 
	reprehensible affairs of the State. The PM would be well advised to go 
	through the pages of history that was not very kind to the despots who had 
	ever dared to bring sedition charge against any of the popular politicians 
	of this land. All our national heroes from Sher-e-Bangla to Shurawardy and 
	Bhasani to Bangabandhu have been subjected to such charges more than once, 
	of course, without any degree of capitulation from any of them. One such 
	infamous sedition case transformed Sheikh Mujib into Bangabandhu and 
	consequently gave birth to Bangladesh. All those despots have been thrown 
	into the debris of history while all the accused heroes remain in the hearts 
	of the millions and would remain so for all time to come.&nbsp; Lastly, by 
	dismissing the demands of the opposition vis-à-vis their proposed reform of 
	the EC and the CTG, and her declared intransigence to hold the next election 
	under the current framework, the PM seems to have forgotten so easily the 
	humiliating end she herself had to meet in 1996.</span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">A democratic leader transforms to despotic when he/she 
	fails to listen to the voice of the people. A few months ago, one such 
	chorale was sung by the people of a southern city through their verdict in 
	the mayoral election. The similar message was once again loudly delivered by 
	the people of a northern district in a recent by-election. The fully 
	‘intact’ four party alliance was not able to save any of those days for the 
	honourable Prime Minister. Has the PM completely failed to listen to such 
	loud and clear voice of the people? Her speech of despondence, 
	unfortunately, reaffirmed so.</span></font></p>
