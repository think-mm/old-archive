	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1995 two reputed constitutional 
	lawyers of Canada while analyzing the legalities of the possible separation 
	of Quebec from Canada, observed, “after 1945, Bangladesh was the only 
	country of the world which successfully seceded from Pakistan through armed 
	struggle. However, the principal strength of that struggle came from the 
	unparallel election victory of Awami League led by its charismatic leader 
	Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The popular support he enjoyed was unheard of in a 
	Western Democracy”. The similar views were reverberated in the Capitol Hill, 
	throughout our liberation war, such as “Sheikh Mujib’s only crime was to win 
	a democratic election”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It could be affirmed in unqualified 
	term that the election of 1970 was the main source of our internal strength, 
	external support and the only legal basis of the proclamation of our 
	independence. Although the election was held under a legal framework, but 
	the people of the then Bangladesh did not really pay any attention to it. 
	Their main preoccupation was to drum up support in favour of the six point 
	program in order to give Sheikh Mujib an absolute mandate in dealing with 
	interest of the Bengaee people. It was not election in its actual sense; it 
	was a magna carta for emancipation. People, by and large, had no illusion 
	that it would be achieved under the framework of Pakistani state as 
	six-point was a formula for quasi-independence (two currencies and para-military 
	force formed the heart of that quasi). Hundreds and thousands of volunteers, 
	including the author of this piece, who moved from village to village, 
	mahalla to mahalla to invoke people to vote for Sheikh Mujib’s candidate 
	never hid the fact that the six-point would be transformed into ONE POINT if 
	the situation demands. Smooth and spontaneous transition from the demand for 
	autonomy to the struggle for independence on March 1, 1971 proved the 
	effectiveness of that calculated groundwork. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By taking part in the election, 
	Sheikh Mujib not only proved the farsightedness of his leadership but also 
	elevated himself from a politician to a statesman. Without taking part in an 
	election there is no other valid and trusted mechanism to prove the 
	popularity of a political party, its leader and the support for its 
	platform. There was a wide spread belief in the military camp and their 
	allies among Bengalees that Sheikh Mujib would not get more than 60% of the 
	national assembly seats allocated to East Pakistan. This was reaffirmed by 
	Yahya Khan to Henry Kissinger, who wrote, “I took the opportunity to ask 
	Yahya what would happen to powers of the President after the election. Yahya 
	could not have been more confident. He expected a multiplicity of the 
	parties to emerge in both West and East Pakistan, which would continually 
	fight each other in each wing of the country and between the two wings; the 
	President would remain arbiter of Pakistan’s politics”. (Ref: Henry 
	Kissinger: The White House Years). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The election results were a big 
	surprise for both the foe’s (including of course Yahya) and to some extent, 
	the friends of the Awami League. In the words General Fazal Muqueem Khan, 
	“the election results have placed the President on the horns of dilemma. The 
	scheme of things he has worked in his mind, with aid and advice of his 
	advisors, has been shattered. He had to make a fresh plan.” (Ref: Pakistan’s 
	Crisis in Leadership). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Following the massive election 
	victory, Mujib did not want to make any compromise with his six-point 
	program. In the words of General Rao Forman Ali, “Mujib asserted publicly 
	that even if the people of Bangladesh (not East Pakistan) have to face 
	bullets, they would achieve the victory of six-points. A few Awami League 
	leaders went as far as saying that if the President does not give consent to 
	the six-point based constitution, they would make unilateral declaration of 
	independence”. (Ref: How Pakistan Got Divided: Rao Forman Ali). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was mentioned earlier that the 
	six-point was a formula for quasi-independence. Maidul Hasan in his very 
	well documented book (Muldhara: 71) analysed the political options of the 
	Pakistani Ruling Junta in the aftermath of the Awami League’s landslide 
	victory in the election. “They had two options open to them: either to 
	accept six-point program thereby decentralizing the administration in order 
	to resurrect the mutual trust between the two regions or to clamp down naked 
	military actions disregarding the election results to establish direct 
	colonial rule over East Bengal. In 1971, neither of the alternatives was 
	absolutely free from the risk of disintegrating the country. However, the 
	former option could have resulted in relatively lower bloodsheds and lesser 
	loss of lives; likewise it could have prolonged the total separation of the 
	two wings. The Pakistani Junta, because of their professional attitude, 
	chose the later option that accelerated the demise of Pakistan”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">New York Times Magazine writer Peggy 
	Durdin who was in Dhaka since February 28, 1971 wrote an article under the 
	title, ‘The Political Tide Wave that Struck East Pakistan’ (Published May 2, 
	1971). She narrated, “All during March, Sheikh Mujib and his aides seemed to 
	be playing devious games and refusing to be candid about their aims and 
	strategy. In fairness it must be said that this was only tactic open to 
	them, since an open stand for independence would have made them immediately 
	liable to charge of treason... Sheikh Mujib never showed the slightest 
	interest in being a national leader of East and West, of taking the position 
	of the Prime Minister of an all Pakistan government that the Assembly 
	majority entitled him to.... In any case, he fostered a movement based on 
	separatist attitude and animosity to West Pakistan”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">James J Novak (who lived in 
	Bangladesh for 20 years since 1970) in his beautiful book entitled 
	‘Bangladesh: Reflections on the Water’ (Indiana University Press, 
	Bloomington, 1993) presented a brilliant depiction of Sheikh Mujib as the 
	politician and the leader of our independence. In the words of Novak, 
	“Sheikh Mujib brought some type of swiftness in politics. He never tired 
	people by shrewd politics or incomplete or abrupt steps. He had no weakness 
	for the government position. From his inception as a politician until his 
	arrest at the beginning of the independence war, he neither publicly uttered 
	nor wrote about independence, but every one knew and understood that he was 
	talking in favour of the independence. Shurawardy wanted reform within the 
	framework of Pakistan and Sheikh Mujib wanted Independence- that was the 
	difference between Shurawardy and Sheikh Mujib... Without giving the 
	ultimate declaration, he kept the Pakistanis guessing. They neither did find 
	any reason to put him to jail nor did they ever get the opportunity to 
	outweigh his moral superiority. During the whole period, Mujib was blinking 
	his eyes and smiling and telling about Bangla and Bangladesh as if, if he 
	wanted he could have enjoyed the scenario of hoisting the red-green flag on 
	his roof top”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">General Rao Forman, however, had 
	different views. He noted, “at last they (Bengalees) thought of the 
	possibility of ruling Pakistan. Mujib wanted to be the Prime Minister (of 
	Pakistan). (But after the postponement of the National Assembly) He came to 
	the conclusion that the combined forces of the Military and the PPP would 
	not let materialize his desire to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan. 
	Therefore, he decided to be the FATHER of a new nation.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, the ground for this 
	transition from six-point to one point did not happen in a day or a month. 
	In the words of Novak, “long before the war of independence, Mujib 
	successfully created the deep feeling among the masses of East Bengal that 
	they are the victims of cruel oppression and aggression of the Pakistanis. 
	As a result, the struggling Bengalees were always morally assured that they 
	are innocent and whatever they were doing was right... He was a known force 
	whose charismatic personality and activities were able to touch the deeper 
	organ of the Bangladesh’s thought. He was a boat on which people’s 
	aspiration could have an easy ride.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Referring to the election victory of 
	the Awami League, Novak wrote, “He could have been the Prime Minister of 
	Pakistan. Without going into that direction, he remained adamant regarding 
	his six-point. As a whole, this six-point was a formula for autonomy - 
	demand for independence.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The election results formed the core 
	basis of our formal and legal declaration of independence on April 10, 1971. 
	It read, “Whereas free elections were held in Bangla Desh from 7th December, 
	1970 to 17th January 1971, to elect representative for the purpose of 
	framing a constitution, and “Whereas at these elections the people of Bangla 
	Desh elected 167 out of 169 representatives belonging to Awami League... 
	“Whereas the Assembly so summoned was arbitrarily and illegally postponed 
	for indefinite period, and “Whereas instead of fulfilling their promise... 
	Pakistan authorities declared an unjust and treacherous war, and “Whereas in 
	the fact and circumstances of such treacherous conduct Bangabandhu Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman, the undisputed leader of 75 millions of people of 
	Bangladesh, duly made declaration of independence at Dhaka on March 26, 
	1971...” (Ref: Proclamation of Independence Order, Mujib Nagar). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To what extent the election results 
	were used to drum up support by many of the members of the US congress 
	against the hostile policy of the Nixon administration could be understood 
	from a few of the extracts enunciated below (Ref: American Response to 
	Bangladesh Liberation War: AMA Muhith): </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Church spoke (May 18, 1971), 
	“What has taken place in East Pakistan since the night of March 25, 1971, 
	when a bloodletting of untold proportion began is hard to comprehend, when 
	the talk between Yahya Khan and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the duly elected 
	leader of the Awami League broke down. This Bengali political party had just 
	won an overwhelming mandate: one hundred sixty seven out of possible 169 
	seats assigned to East Pakistan.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Kennedy on November 18, 1971 
	asserted, “Sheikh Mujib’s only crime was the winning of a free election 
	sponsored by a military regime that later refused to abide by the election 
	mandate”. Senator Church again made a strong statement in the Senate 
	(December 6, 1971), “In those elections the people of East Pakistan had 
	spoken in one voice. They had massively elected the candidates of the Awami 
	League, endorsing a platform, which called for autonomous East Bengal. 
	Bangladesh was the rallying cry in those elections, as it remains the 
	rallying cry today”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Congressman Gallahar on December 8, 
	1971 made a strong argument, “Quite simply, in my view, because India is 
	working closely with the legitimate government of Bangladesh. The Awami 
	League won 167 of the 169 seats contested in East Pakistan.... I am somewhat 
	astounded that some of my colleagues in the congress should so casually 
	dismiss an election victory of such an overwhelming magnitude. I am puzzled 
	that those of us who depend on the will of the people can overlook the 
	fantastic impact this win had on the people of East Pakistan”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Cranston (16 December 1971) 
	accusing the Nixon administration, uttered, “What did the United States do 
	in those 9 months? The administration did not make public peep about the 
	massacre of March 25. It has not made a single public protest about the 
	summary jailing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is accused of treason but 
	whose real crime against the Pakistani state was to win an election”. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Senator Kennedy pressing the demand 
	for the recognition of Bangladesh on February 1, 1972, argued, “All one has 
	to do is to look back to the election of 1970, where the Awami League Party 
	won 167 out of 169 seats, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had sufficient votes to 
	be elected Prime Minister of Pakistan. Those elections were held under 
	martial law, at a time when President Yahya Khan was having his agents 
	attend all meetings of the party. Mr. President, there has rarely been such 
	an overwhelming endorsement for a political party as we have seen in 
	Bangladesh, not only at the national level, but at the local levels as well, 
	in carrying some 285 out 300 districts. I do not think we have ever seen in 
	any of the western nations the kind of political support that Sheikh Mujib 
	now has”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is only rationale to conclude 
	that in the absence of the election mandate of 1970, our freedom struggle 
	would be absolutely devoid of legal, democratic and moral basis and it would 
	face the same eventuality as experienced by Biafra (of Nigeria). Any one, 
	including Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leading the nation to that self-inflicting 
	catastrophe would meet the same fate as mated out to Colonel Ojuku of 
	Biafra. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For all its fairness, Sheikh Mujib 
	was the undisputed hero of our struggle for emancipation, which culminated 
	in the war of liberation. He was the main force and spirit of the Bengali 
	nationhood. Any attempt to equate him with any one else is the reflection of 
	the naiveté of astronomical proportion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since his threatening speech of 
	‘Assalamualikum’ in Kagmari conference of 1956, even Moulana Bhasani’s 
	policy towards our autonomy vis-à-vis independence was one of incoherent in 
	nature. His only clear indication about the independence came in his speech 
	of March 9, 1971 (following Sheikh Mujib’s famous 7th March address) given 
	in Paltan Maidan. In his speech Bhasani told, “So, President Yahya, enough 
	is enough. It is needless to aggravate the animosity. Lakumdinukum wa 
	liaddinn. Accept the independence of East Bengal... If you do not concede to 
	the demands of Sheikh Mujib by 25th of March, I will join him (he accepted 
	Mujib’s leadership since he did not ask Mujib to join him) to create a mass 
	movement as was done in 1952&quot;. To assure people about Mujib’s leadership, 
	the Moulana went on in an emotional voice, “Mujib is like my son. I know 
	Mujib. He did politics with me. The germ of independence was in his head 
	since then. Unnecessarily, do not mistrust him”. (Ref: Ami Bijoy Dekhechi: M 
	R Akhter Mukul). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the same day, in front of Baitul 
	Mukarrom, Ataur Rahman Khan of the then Jatio League delivered, “The 
	independence of Bangladesh is the life-long dream of Sheikh Mujib. We 
	started the work at the same time. We lagged behind, but he has advanced 
	ahead. He has declared independence (referring to his 7th March address). I 
	am asking him to form an all party national government”. (ref: Ekaturrer 
	Ashojog Andoloner Dinguli: Najimuddin Manik). On the 23rd of March, Moshiur 
	Rahman, General Secretary of the NAP (Bhasani) admitted that his rival 
	(Awami League) has the full support of 75 million Bengalees (The Times, 24 
	March 1971). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the nine-month of genocide, 
	arm struggles and untold sufferings, Sheikh Mujib’s name glowed ceaselessly 
	to the hearts of the millions and he remained a demigod to the people of 
	Bangladesh. In the words of General Rao Forman Ali, “90% of the people of 
	Bangladesh were taken in by the magical power of Sheikh Mujib, and they were 
	ready to sacrifice their lives for the creation of Bangladesh”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I would like to cite the feeling of 
	one of our illustrious sons, Dr. Mohammed Younus, the then a Ph. D. 
	candidate at Vanderbilt University, about the leadership of Sheikh Mujib in 
	the darkest hours of the 27th of March 1971. In expressing his mind, Dr. 
	Younus wrote, “--while speculating what might have happened to Sheikh Mujib, 
	finally a news came that he has been arrested at Chittagong railway station 
	while he was fleeing from the army. We were in tears after hearing the news. 
	Until then we were making all kind of possibilities of Sheikh guiding the 
	nation at war from some underground bunker. All that the nation needed was 
	his live voice over the radio. Pakistan had no chance with all their 
	sophisticated fire-power against his voice”. (Ref: American Response to 
	Bangladesh Liberation War: AMA Muhith). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Last year, in the world-wide survey 
	of BBC Bengali service listeners, while he was voted the greatest Bengali 
	ever born, one of the listeners observed, “he was the bacon in the darkness 
	that befallen on the Bengalee people during the semi-colonial Pakistani era. 
	His political wisdom, uncompromising leadership for the cause of the 
	Bengalees united the Bengalee people, for the first time in history, not 
	only within the geographical boundaries of Bangladesh, but all over the 
	world, and gave them the nationhood. Bengalees all over then world, who 
	cherish the citizenship of Bangladesh, owe this nationhood to the leadership 
	of one person and he is no other than Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me conclude with an excerpt from 
	Novak’s book. In the words of Novak, “he was a very simple-minded human 
	being, who had some simple and straight beliefs and thoughts for his 
	people... But he failed. In spite of that, he is BANGABANDHU, the FATHER of 
	the NATION. These laurels are due to him. Not because he was a skilled 
	statesman, but because of his impeccable love and sympathy for his people... 
	He was elevated to the highest spectrum where a human being could ever 
	reach. How many of us could have done better than this any way”? </font></p>
