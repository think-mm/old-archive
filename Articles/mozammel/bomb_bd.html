	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The worst did not happen, but could 
	have happened. The perpetrators of the last Wednesday’s country wide bomb 
	attacks were some what kind for the fact that they did not use yet the 
	deadliest weapons as available in the arsenals of their international 
	comrades. If they had, there would have been a national catastrophe of 
	astronomical magnitude. The precision at which half a thousand or so bombs 
	were detonated in every district town of the country except one, with the 
	utmost accuracy in a time span of only thirty minutes, not only underscored 
	their superb technical know-how but reflected their disciplined and 
	synchronized net work as well. Next time around, God forbid, people of the 
	country may not be so fortunate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The act of unprecedented terrorism 
	that was inflicted on the nation on Wednesday might have caught the highly 
	politicised, just like any other organs of the State, intelligence agency of 
	the country by surprise, but not the concerned citizens, many local media 
	and to some extent the international media analysts those who bothered to 
	write about the impending danger of the rising Islamic militancy in 
	Bangladesh. But the current government since the publication of an article, 
	‘Bangladesh: A Cocoon of Terror’ in the Far Eastern Economic Review is 
	constantly in a state of denial. The Economists in its 16th June issue 
	commented, “the government makes it hard for foreign journalists to visit. 
	When they do, it tends not to like what they write, especially recent 
	suggestions that Bangladesh is witnessing a rise in Islamic extremism, and 
	becoming a haven for international terrorists.” In direct contrast to the 
	situations prevailing under the current government vis-à-vis those of its 
	predecessor, the Economist wrote, “Rich-country diplomats say that whereas, 
	three years ago, their main focus was on economic development, it is now on 
	defending democracy.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If there is one thing consistent 
	about our government, it is to be in a state of denial. This is why, all the 
	stories about the rising Islamic militancy, including the New York Times 
	Magazine’s unflattering story &quot;The Next Islamic Revolution?&quot; has provoked 
	the similar words of denial from the government so much so, that it 
	completely refused to acknowledge even a shred of authenticity in any of the 
	reports. Any one subscribing to the views of the international media were 
	dubbed as ‘unpatriotic’ and have been accused of undermining the ‘image’ of 
	the country. The media analysts were labelled Indian, Jewish or American 
	agents, who were all out there to ‘tarnish the image’ of the country. In 
	tune with the borrowed phrase of the government from an erstwhile US 
	ambassador that ‘Bangladesh is a moderate Muslim county’, some of our 
	expatriate compatriots, who enjoy their lives in free and democratic 
	societies, in joy and in grief, wrote pieces dismissing the vivid stories of 
	activities of the Islamic militants and potential threat they possess to our 
	traditional free society. Their envision of patriotism excludes the 
	cognizance of the forces who are identified as potential threat to our free 
	system and thought. These one-eyed patriots fail to comprehend the fact that 
	militancy and extremism do not engulf the nation in pursuance of the free 
	will of the people. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One after another, when the secular 
	institutions or personalities were targeted, the government not only accused 
	the opposition secular political parties for committing the crimes, but also 
	took their leaders into custody and inflicted inhuman torture on them. But 
	so far none of them has ever been indicted for any of the crimes and all of 
	the crimes, till date, including the carnage of August 21 remain unsolved. 
	Right after the current very well-orchestrated bomb attacks, the government 
	leaders took no time, in their traditional practice, to blame the opposition 
	AL for the heinous acts. Starting from the senior ministers to the leaders 
	of the youth wing of the BNP, they have not only blamed, “those who try to 
	tarnish the country's image have committed the heinous crime”, a phrase 
	commonly reserved for AL, but some youth leaders went as far demanding to 
	take some AL leaders including the leader of the opposition and former PM to 
	remand, a common practice initiated by the current government to treat the 
	opposition politicians. BNP’s partner, the Jamati Islami, was not as 
	ambiguous about the allegation since its Secretary General was very explicit 
	and squarely blamed the AL, which, in his words, “conducted the 
	unprecedented blasts as part of a blue print to make the country politically 
	unstable.” Without contesting the seemingly ridiculous logic behind the 
	allegations, it would be suffice to comment that if AL had such organized 
	power to carry out these massive and disciplined operations, there would 
	have been martyrs on both sides, not in the AL camp only, over last four 
	years of the alliance rule. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One might argue that the opposition 
	leaders are similarly blaming the government for the bomb attacks. However, 
	one has to take cognizance of the fact it is the government, which has all 
	the machinery under its control to prove that the opposition is wrong, it is 
	not the other way around. Opposition has no power to take any one on remand 
	or to interrogate any one to investigate the accusations and counter 
	accusations. Since both sides are accusing each other for the crime, an 
	opposition suggestion to invite a neutral body such as FBI to carry out the 
	investigations carries logical merits. This practice is followed in many 
	countries including Canada, in spite of the fact that it has a very well 
	powered de-politicized agency by the name RCMP to carry any criminal 
	investigation. This would be possible only if the government abandons its 
	policy of embracing any foe of AL as its friend. Some members of the 
	parliament and ministers of the ruling alliance belonging to the northern 
	area where Banglabhai and his comrades are trying to re-establish their 
	reign of terror flatly denied, even after the country wide attacks, the 
	existence of the thug leader, albeit the so-called Banglabhai has been 
	featured in a number of stories relating to Bangladesh in the international 
	media including the recent one in The Economist. Even their own government 
	has been doing mock attempt to arrest the person who was nonexistent in its 
	radar before his organization was banned. Some political analysts who are in 
	cohort with the government in its state of denial spared no time on casting 
	doubt on the ability of the Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), who 
	claimed the responsibility through leaflets, to carry out such massive and 
	well-orchestrated attacks, as if they are well aware of the nitty-gritty of 
	this organization. In fact, the credibility of the government leaders and 
	their cohorts has never been in such low ebbs. The more vociferous the 
	denial of the government, the greater the chance that the denied story might 
	just be true. It seems that only way one could find out if something has 
	gone wrong when the government leaders issue denials that anything has gone 
	wrong anywhere. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The dress rehearsal of the impending 
	danger should force the government to withdraw itself from the state of 
	denial. The danger is no more hypothetical and if, though already very late, 
	not taken seriously would destroy the foundation of the free society that 
	bulk of our citizens so much cherish. The lion share of the onus to protect 
	our value systems and democracy rests with the government, which, in the 
	first place, needs to pull itself out of the state of denial and protect it 
	with the help of the people, acknowledging the fact that the opposition 
	political parties are an integral part of the process. The stakes could not 
	be higher: the nation and the freedom of its people and the BNP and its 
	current allies have not been given the exclusive right to them. Dr. Mozammel
