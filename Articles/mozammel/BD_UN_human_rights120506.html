	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On Tuesday, May 9, Bangladesh was 
	elected to the newly formed Human Rights Council (HRC) of the United 
	Nations. Along with the other 46 member states, Bangladesh has been elected 
	from the Asian group that comprised 13 members. Out of the thirteen, four 
	elected for one-year term, four were for two-year and the other five for 
	three-year term. The terms were distributed simply by drawing the lot and 
	Bangladesh was fortunate to secure a berth in the three-year term. 
	Resolution 50/252 of March 15, 2006 of the General Assembly created the HRC. 
	Along with all other candidates, Bangladesh also made some pledges, which 
	were made available in UN website. Attributing the victory of Bangladesh as 
	a milestone in the achievements of Bangladesh's foreign policy the Foreign 
	Minister M Morshed Khan told a hurriedly called press briefing on May 10 
	that &quot;the victory of Bangladesh in the Human Rights Council elections 
	signifies strong international endorsement for the government's commitment 
	to upholding and promoting human rights in Bangladesh which is recognised by 
	the global community as well as by the regional and other interna-tional 
	communities. When a conspiratorial campaign is launched at home and abroad 
	trying to brand Bangladesh as a country of human rights violations, 
	Bangladesh's victory is an apt reply to the critics and campaigners.&quot;<br>
	In the words of the former Canadian Supreme Court Justice Ms. Louise Arbour, 
	the current High Commissioner of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), &quot;the 
	elections were more on the pledges than performances.&quot; Election of Saudi 
	Arabia and China, not two of the greatest iconic states for upholding human 
	rights, only attested the validity of her assertions. She further attributed 
	the formation of the council that replaces the Commission, as &quot;a historic 
	opportunity to improve the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms 
	of people around the world.&quot; The similar views were echoed by Secretary 
	General Kofi Annan when he said, &quot;now the real work begins. The true test of 
	the Council's credibility will be the use that Member States make of it. If, 
	in the weeks and months ahead, they act on the commit-ments they have given 
	in this resolution, I am confident that the Council will breathe new life 
	into all our work for human rights, and thereby help to improve the lives of 
	millions of people throughout the world.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In concurrence with the assertions 
	of two top most officials of the UN, every country who aspired to be a 
	member, was invited to ink her pledges and like all other candidates, 
	Bangladesh drafted a document highlighting a few points in support of her 
	candidacy. Those points reflected the universal aspirations of the people of 
	Bangladesh, irrespective of the government of the day. Two of them are as 
	follows:<br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. Bangladesh's deep commitment to 
	the promotion and protection of human rights of all of its citizens emanates 
	from its constitutional obligation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. At the national level, 
	Bangladesh, a democratic and pluralistic polity, is fully committed to the 
	principles of good gover-nance, democracy, rule of law and promotion and 
	protection of human rights and fundamental freedom of all her citizens, with 
	particular attention to the rights of women, children and minorities. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As voluntary pledges, Bangla-desh 
	(here the govern-ment's commitments came into play) would, in addition to 
	other things, (i) establish the National Human Rights Commission as soon as 
	possible; (ii) separate the judiciary and executive as soon as possible.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As an achievement, the document 
	highlighted the govern-ment's commitment to fight against corruption and the 
	formation of an Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), albeit the 
	real independence of which and any blip of success are yet to be felt by the 
	people. The body, in complete devoid of direction, has been in feud within 
	its own rank and file since its inception and the country, in the mean time, 
	proceeds uninterruptedly towards creating a few more world records, only 
	breaking the ones of its own. Citizens of the Republic have very little 
	knowledge of the formation of the promised National Human Rights Commission 
	(NHRC) while they have seen the dillydallying tactics of the government in 
	separating the judiciary from the executive branch of the government. 
	However, if the NHRC is at all formed during the rest of the tenure of the 
	government, its 'neutrality' may not be any better than that of current 
	Election Commission and its activities may not be any more pronounced than 
	the ACC. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question is how far the current 
	government has been successful to live up to the universal aspirations of 
	the people as outlined above. Is the govern-ment of the day adhering to its 
	constitutional obligations? Is the law-enforcing agency uphold-ing the rule 
	of law? Day after day, the government is telling the same fictitious story 
	of killing innocent (According to UDHR Article 11.(1) &quot;everyone charged with 
	a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty 
	according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees 
	necessary for his defence&quot;) people in the name of so-called 'crossfire' 
	knowing very well that the people of the country do not believe it. The 
	constitution is very explicit when it declares in its article 35 (3) that, 
	&quot;every person accused of a criminal offence shall have the right to a speedy 
	and public trial by an independent and impartial court or tribunal 
	established by law&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As regards the 'fundamental freedom 
	of her citizens', the brutal crimes of the members of law enforcing agency 
	committed to the people of Kansat reflected the atrocities of a barbaric 
	society and only on the other day, there would have been a repetition of the 
	same barbarism if the law enforcing personnel would only comply with the 
	order of the local lawmaker of the ruling alliance in Shanir Akhra. 
	Obviously, no legal action has been initiated against the said lawmaker 
	although the story of his unautho-rised order to shoot people was published 
	in all the major news dailies of the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many of the members of the current 
	government, including the PM, have the perpetual obsession of inventing 
	conspiracy in every action of the citizens that are critical of the 
	government's misdeeds, which very well and in most cases, include the denial 
	of the fundamental constitutional rights of the citizens. It was, as usual, 
	reflected in the comments of the foreign minister while expressing his 
	satisfaction over the election of Bangladesh to HRC, undermining the fact 
	that, in this electronic age, the brutal acts at Kansat or the police 
	atrocities at Chittagong were beamed from Cape Town to Canada within 
	minutes. The government leaders ignore the fact that the universal 
	aspirations of the citizens of the Republic as reflected in the constitution 
	(and as highlighted in her campaign for an HRC seat) is a national 
	commitment and that makes it obligatory for every citizen concerned to raise 
	concerns in any forums, national or international, to mitigate the 
	situation. It would be a good avenue to reassure our current government 
	leaders that when they would be out of the helm and if their political 
	adversaries inflict on them the similar torture and harassment as they 
	themselves have been subjected to over the last four and a half years, these 
	'conspirators' would be in the fore front to raise their voices to alleviate 
	their sufferings, exactly the way they are doing today. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, Bangladesh's election to 
	HRC is nothing new since Bangladesh has been an uninterrupted member of CHR 
	from 1983 to 2000, Vice-Chair of the Bureau of Human Rights Commission in 
	1998 and is a current member (2006-2008) of CHR as well. The new dimensions 
	come from the rejuvenated mandate of HRC that would replace CHR on June 19, 
	2006 and that includes the resolves such as, &quot;members of the Council will 
	undergo the Council's new universal review mechanism during their term of 
	membership. The General Assembly would have the right to suspend the rights 
	and privileges of any Council Member that it decides has persistently 
	committed gross and systematic violations of human rights during its term of 
	membership.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This resoluteness was reverberated 
	by the words of the General Assembly President Jan Eliasson, while declaring 
	the election results, &quot;I find it very important that all Member States have 
	made pledges and commitments to human rights which they are expected to live 
	up to, and also that they have accepted, by their membership in the Human 
	Rights Council, to be reviewed, that their human rights record is to be 
	reviewed.&quot; This mandate puts the council member states in direct human 
	rights radar screen of the UN vis-à-vis their pledges and commitments. From 
	this perspective, Bangladesh's election to HRC is indeed a reassuring news 
	for those who are genuinely concerned with the violations of human rights in 
	Bangladesh.</font></p>
