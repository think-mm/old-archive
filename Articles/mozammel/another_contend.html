	<span lang="EN-CA">The ongoing state of emergency saw the launching of yet 
	another political party as Ferdous Ahmed Qureshi on July 21 floated 
	Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) despite a ban on all kinds of political 
	activities. In his maiden press conference while announcing the formation of 
	party he declared that (DS July 22, 2007) “the PDP will contest all the 300 
	constituencies in the next general elections, which, he believes, will be 
	held by the end of 2008 and his party hopes to form the next government.”</span></font></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="color:#333333">Yet another politician, the most

	have been energized by his recent expulsion from the party that enjoyed the

	He went on to declare that “</span><span lang="EN-CA">the image of the party 
	has been destroyed in the last five years. So, sacrificing leadership would 
	be reinstated in the party and the corrupt and terrorist leaders will be 
	excluded</span></font><b><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #333333">.</span></b><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #333333">”
	</span><font face="Times New Roman">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="color:#333333">This is indeed a wonderful 
	resolution. However, does Mannan Bhuiyan hold the moral ground to lead the 
	crusade against corrupted elements inside the party?</span></font></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
	<span lang="EN-CA" style="color:#333333">Let us go back about a year from 
	today. </span><span lang="EN-CA">The TIB launched its corruption index on 
	July 5, 2006 where the LGRD and Cooperatives ministry came top in 
	corruption. It alleged that the ministry accounted for Tk 208.9 crore out of 
	a total of Tk 526.27 crore misappropriated at different ministries. In 
	response Mannan Bhuiyan threatened (DS July 11) the TIB, “i<span style="color:#333333">f 
	you [TIB] don't take the report back, there will be processions against TIB 
	in different districts and we will also take legal action.” He went further 
	sordidly aiming at our octogenarian conscience of the nation, “</span>who is 
	Mozaffar Ahmed? He was a minister during the military regime of late 
	president Ziaur Rahman. Allegations of corruption had been there against him 
	as well.&quot; &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA">Over the last few days, 
	through the courtesy of satellite TV, audiences all over the world were able 
	to see the palatial house of Mannan Bhuiyan transformed into a Mecca for BNP 
	politicians. They included many former MPs and ministers, whose stories of 
	wanton corruption filled the pages of the media before and after &quot;one 
	eleven.&quot; However, the most hypocritical aspect of Mannan Bhuiyan’s resolve 
	to clean ‘his’ BNP from the corrupt elements got revealed from his reported 
	request of M Saifur Rahman to take over the chairmanship of the party. If 
	the stories of credible media are to be believed, Saifur Rahman will 
	undoubtedly be crowned with a distinctive laurel of corruption that may not 
	be surpassed by very many in our corruption arena. Aside from tax evasion, 
	he abused his power to the extent of leasing 500 acres of land to his two 
	sons at a price of 5 taka per acre, an unparallel magnitude of power abuse 
	even by the standard of our depraved political history. H<span style="color:black">is 
	son riding on his own co-tail became an MP and was a notorious terror and 
	extortionist until he was put behind bar following the emergency. Yet, 
	Mannan Bhuiyan wants </span>to get the party rid of “<span style="color:#333333">corrupt 
	and terrorist elements<b>”</b></span><span style="color:black"> by 
	installing Saifur Rahman at the helm of it and form the next government!”
	</span></span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA" style="color:#333333">In 
	full tune with the affirmation of our people </span><span lang="EN-CA">
	Mannan Bhuiyan in his statement said, “<span style="color:#333333">the 
	country cannot go back to the situation before January 11 since it saved the 
	nation from a civil war like situation.” </span>Notwithstanding the 
	pathetically short memories of our people, it would not be difficult to 
	recollect the actions and deeds of the political party and their leaders who 
	bear the lion share of responsibility that contributed to the creation of 
	‘civil war like situations’. Those leaders are no other than the BNP 
	Chairperson Khaleda Zia and her second in command and the visible spokesman 
	Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. Mannan Bhuiyan after his long dialogue drama with 
	Abdul Jalil declared, bulldozing the high expectations of the people, on 
	November 2, 2006 that “the</span></font><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
	14-</span><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA">party coalition's 
	demand for restructuring the Election Commission (EC) is '<i>new</i>' to

	</span><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA">About the controversy 
	regarding assumption of the office of the chief adviser by the president he 
	said, &quot;the president took the charge constitutionally and by taking the 
	decision he saved the nation from a constitutional crisis.&quot; </span></font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;On October 28, 2006 Mannan 
	Bhuiyan bluntly lied to the ATN audience, from Teknaf to Toronto, at the 
	gate of the Bangabhaban that Justice Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury has refused to 
	take the responsibility of CA. However, the same TV channel revealed to its 
	audience on October 29 at 1:00 am that the <span style="color:#333333">
	former chief justice Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury reportedly told Bangabhaban 
	yesterday that he has no objection to assuming the post of the chief adviser 
	to the next caretaker government. On December 30, 2006 terming all the 
	demands raised by the alliance as <i>'resolved issues'</i>, he said, &quot;The 
	14-party wants to make issues of the resolved ones.&quot; On the same day, 
	rejecting the demands of Awami League led grand alliance, Abdul Mannan 
	Bhuiyan said “the question of resignation of the chief adviser of the 
	caretaker government does not arise at all.” On January 8, 2007 </span>
	Mannan Bhuiyan said, “the election must be held on January 22 and if the 
	Awami League led grand alliance has any demands unfulfilled, the next 
	government will fulfil them.”</span></font><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: black">
	</span><font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA">Alas, our Armed 
	forces did not give any opportunity to Mannan Bhuiyan to get a walkover to 
	the helm of the state to fulfil the ‘unfulfilled’ demands of the AL led 
	alliance!&nbsp; </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;Would it be unfair to ask 
	Mr. Bhuiyan if the corruptions that made his ministry the number one in the 
	TIB list and his consequent threat to take legal action against TIB were 
	instigated by the then PM of the country? In a similar token, would Mr. 
	Bhuiyan divulge to the nation if his betrayal in the dialogue drama with 
	Abdul Jalil and the his aforementioned comments leading to the creation of 
	‘civil war like situations’ before January 11, were carried out at the 
	instruction of his erstwhile party chief? </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;As it stands today only two 
	political leaders so far have expressed their hope to form the next 
	government. As for Mr. Qureshi, so far the political arena is concerned, he 
	neither possesses many assets to help materializing his dream neither is he 
	burdened with much liabilities that would desist him from making his wish 
	list, albeit those who are visible at his side at this time, borrowing the 
	words from Mahfuz Anam, “will not be worth the paper their names will be 
	written on.”</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<font face="Times New Roman"><span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;The second contender, 
	however, are sitting on a double edged sword. <span style="color:black">&nbsp;If 
	he succeeds in establishing his claim, a long shot indeed, of the mainstream 
	BNP, he has to shoulder the burden of the responsibility of the most 
	despicable governance this country has ever experienced. If he fails, the 
	most probable outcome if political parties’ past factional history is of 
	anything to learn from, he has to organize a new political party, which in 
	any pragmatist’s view would be a daunting task indeed. In either scenario, 
	he would need much more than the free and fair expressions of the will of 
	the people to form the next government. The mere fact that his counterpart 
	is languishing in jail, albeit while in power, no corruption story about him 
	or his ministry ever surfaced in any news media while Mannan Bhuiyan is a 
	freeman and more than two dozens AL men are in jail for attending a private 
	dinner party in Sylhet while he encountered no problem in holding a 
	political gathering amid chanting slogans by his supporters, displaying 
	banner and using microphones in front of national and international 
	electronic media glaringly reflecting that some are ‘more equal’ than the 
	others in the eyes of law. Only time will tell how far these extra supports 
	will translate into helping him forming the next government as he has wished 
	after his expulsion from the primary membership of the BNP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></font></p>
