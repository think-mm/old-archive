	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It started on the night of October 
	1, 2001 when it became clear that the four party alliance was on the verge 
	of winning the election. The targets were the members of the religious 
	minority community and the opposition workers. The scenario was not the one 
	of reflecting the magnanimity in the aftermath of a democratic exercise; the 
	way hell broke loose, as if it was an armed revolution overthrowing a 
	dictatorial government. Since then torture, killings and rapes continued 
	unabated. Newspapers were full of tales of depravity depicting the ruthless 
	crimes of the ruling party thugs and the obvious indifference of the law 
	enforcing agencies to their response to duty. Except for some isolated 
	incidents, this scenario was never present in the Bangladesh political 
	landscape even when two previous regimes, one of JP and another of BNP were 
	forced to relinquish power following two separate mass upsurges. Even after 
	the victory of our nine month armed struggle in 1971, very few of our 
	victors took the task in their own hand to deal with people who took part in 
	looting, killing and torturing our people. Had it happened, many of our 
	present day custodians would not be breathing today to rise to helm of the 
	State whose very creation they violently opposed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Custodial torture and death became a 
	regular phenomenon with the assumption of the power of the alliance 
	government. The brutal techniques of torture meted out to the adversaries of 
	the government, politicians and intellectuals alike, during the colonial 
	rule once again resurfaced. During the semi-colonial rule of Pakistan, 
	similar inhuman techniques of torture such as electric shock, blindfolded 
	beatings as were inflicted on Ela Mitra in Rajshahi jail and the accused of 
	the so-called Agartala conspiracy case inside Dhaka cantonment. According to 
	the statistics given by the Human Rights bodies, in the first three years of 
	the alliance rule alone, 115 people lost their lives in police custody. None 
	of the incidents has ever been investigated and no punishment has ever been 
	dispensed out to the perpetrators. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The UN declaration on Human Rights 
	is very explicit in its declaration on custodial torture when in its Article 
	5 it says, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or 
	degrading treatment or punishment”. Even during a war, article 3 (a) of the 
	Geneva convention explicitly prohibits, “violence to life and person, in 
	particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture”, 
	while on custody. It would be worth mentioning here an incident involving a 
	Syrian born Canadian citizen who was tortured in Syrian (an autocratic 
	state) custody as a terrorist suspect. Human Right organizations and 
	politicians all across Canada bitterly criticized the Canadian government 
	for its failure to prevent the torture and secure his early release. To 
	admit the government’s remissness, the Prime Minister of Canada went to the 
	residence of the victim and personally offered his apology on behalf of the 
	government of Canada. Only on the other day, the Canadian Ambassador in 
	Syria has been grilled in the House of Commons by the MPs from all political 
	spectrum for his failure to prevent the torture inflicted on a Canadian 
	citizen. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Probably the most despicable of all 
	the crimes committed by the government is termed by Human Right 
	organizations as ‘terrorism by the State’. These reprehensible acts, 
	ironically, are perpetrated by the government of a State that derived its 
	authority from a constitutional process. The guardians of that authority are 
	bound by their oath to defend its source, the constitution of the Republic. 
	According to the report of a Bangla Daily (October 13, 2005) which collected 
	the information from a number of sources, there were 56 deaths in the name 
	of so-called ‘heart attack’ in the operation clean heart carried out by the 
	members of the armed forces from October 16, 2002 to January 9 ,2003. When 
	the kin of some of the victims went to the court, in pursuance to their 
	basic rights as enshrined in the constitution, challenging the allegedly 
	fictitious story of the authority regarding the death of their loved ones, 
	the government passed an indemnity act, the second time in our 
	constitutional history, blatantly curbing the fundamental rights of the 
	citizens of a free State to seek justice. According to the same report, so 
	far 556 people have been killed in name of ‘crossfire’ by the members of the 
	police and the newly formed Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). These are glaring 
	cases of extra-judicial denial of right of to life by the State overtly 
	undermining the principal tenet of a just society that clearly manifests an 
	equal right to life for every person. Even the strongest proponents of 
	capital punishment in the modern day States never ever argue in favour of 
	utter and deliberate denial of life without recourse to judicial 
	proceedings. The UN Human Rights Charter in its Article 11 has made it 
	explicitly clear that, “everyone charged with a penal offence has the right 
	to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public 
	trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defence”. The 
	constitutions of all the present day states, including that of the People’s 
	Republic of Bangladesh in Article 35(3), have incorporated the very essence 
	of the aforesaid declaration. By engaging itself in the extrajudicial 
	killings, the government is putting itself in the dock on multiple counts. 
	Firstly, it is further jeopardizing its already shattered credibility since 
	the authority is attributing the cold-blooded murders as crossfire while the 
	people largely know that there is no existence of such an occurrence. 
	Secondly, every death in crossfire adds an extra count of no confidence of 
	the government on the judicial process thereby encouraging the proliferation 
	of anarchism in the society. Thirdly, it is a flagrant violation of the UN 
	human charter and the constitution of the Republic. Fourthly, the cabinet 
	ministers, one after another are not only lauding the so-called 
	extrajudicial denial of lives but also are reprehending the proponents of 
	basic human right and rule of law. Utterance of the finance minister that, 
	“if the killings by the killers are not human right violation, how can any 
	one term the death of killer a human right violation?”, has equated an 
	individual with the state, reflecting the sheer incomprehension on the part 
	of the minister of the rule of law. Only a few days ago, while elaborating 
	the successes of the government in the last four years, one of the senior 
	cabinet ministers categorically denied that no innocent person has ever been 
	killed by crossfire reflecting his absolute lack of perception of the 
	Article 11 of the UNHR charter and Article 35(3) of Bangladesh constitution 
	as outlined above. Finally, there are wide spectrum of condemnations by the 
	human right organizations and the international bodies around the globe, 
	which has placed the much-desired image of the country in the dock. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The atrocities of so-called Bangla 
	Bhai, which were are either aided by some leaders of the ruling coalition or 
	ignored by the central leaders of the government reflected a horrific state 
	of affairs of the State where the citizens of the republic were killed and 
	kept hanging on the trees. These horrid activities of an alleged criminal, 
	whose existent was constantly denied by the government leaders until 
	recently, albeit there were reports of his parading the streets of a 
	northern city along with his co-accomplices with police escort, attracted 
	media attention even outside our border. On several occasions, his followers 
	fought pitched battles with the members of the law enforcing agencies in 
	broad day light. The Bangla Bhai has now grown into a monster, as he was the 
	alleged mastermind of the unprecedented bomb attacks on August 17 and 
	October 3. How far the government is serious about bringing this so far 
	‘nonexistent’ criminal to justice is yet to be seen. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The age-old practice of appointing 
	our best talents to the University faculty has come to end with the 
	assumption of power by the four party alliance--indeed a far-reaching 
	consequence for the future of the nation. A candidate’s eligibility now is 
	determined by one’s allegiance to a particular political belief, a clear 
	case of discrimination as defined in the Human Right charter. Only on the 
	other day, the best student of both the Honours and the Masters Degree Exams 
	of a Dhaka university department was bypassed by the inferior ones only 
	because the said student’s brother is an activist of an opposition political 
	party. On a personal account, last month my own niece who topped the merit 
	list of both the Honours and the M. Sc. Exams and the recipient of multiple 
	gold medals of a department of Islamic University was not selected for a 
	faculty position although multiple appointments took place in the 
	department. My absolutely apolitical niece, the youngest child of a humble 
	widow, never had any time even to explore the difference between Bengali and 
	Bangladeshi nationalism. In any other democracies, this discrimination is a 
	serious human right issue and is rightfully dealt in the national human 
	right commission. In the absence of any such independent commission, and in 
	the alliance ruled Bangladesh when the executive acts as the judge, jury, 
	and executioner what type recourse is available to the citizens to redress 
	the gross violation of human rights any way?</font></p>
