	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Iajuddin Ahmed, the self-assumed 
	Chief Adviser (CA) of the caretaker government (CTG) spared no time in 
	installing four advisors to replace the four who resigned from the 
	government to protest his dictatorial, partisan and unconstitutional 
	behaviours in running the affairs of the state at the most crucial juncture 
	of nation’s history. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His mentor, the outgoing PM Khaleda 
	Zia over the last two years was delivering repeated sermons to the nation 
	that her opponents are involved in conspiracy and are all out there to 
	destroy the democracy and development that her government has so 
	painstakingly carried out over the last five years. Even today (December 13) 
	she called upon all to free the country from the hands of &quot;local and foreign 
	conspirators&quot;. She further alleged that her opponents have destroyed the 
	sanctity of all the constitutional institutions, such the EC, the Supreme 
	Court, the President and the Constitution. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Conspiracy as defined by Random 
	House Dictionary is ‘an evil, unlawful, treacherous or surreptitious plan 
	formulated in secret by two or more persons’. Whatever activities or action 
	plans that have been formulated by Khaleda Zia’s opponents as regard to the 
	above institutions are made public and are carried out in broad daylight 
	together with tens of thousands of attendees. So they could be termed 
	anything but conspiracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, the sanctity of those 
	institutions has been systematically demolished one after another, by the 
	BNP and its co-accomplices and on most occasions, it was done by 
	conspiratorial means. Let us concentrate our attention to each of them 
	separately. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Never before in the history of this 
	country, was the Election Commission manned by a group of partisan, 
	incompetent and people with absolute moral bankruptcy. Their ethical 
	standard is so low that they even lack the articulation to hide their 
	partisan feelings. In the words of the Dr. Akbar Ali Khan, ‘the EC became so 
	controversial that no one wanted to join the body’. Instead of alleviating 
	the situation, Iajuddin Ahmed has accelerated its sliding by appointing two 
	more birds of the same feathers by means, which truly fits the 
	characteristics of conspiracy as defined by Random House. Did the opponents 
	of Khaleda Zia play any part in that conspiracy? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Iajuddin Ahmed, as President of 
	the Republic, without exploring the three other options as stipulated in the 
	constitution, to appoint CA of the CTG, has appointed himself the CA of the 
	CTG. This was a flagrant violation of the constitution. The constitutional 
	stipulations in this respect are so clear that one does not have to be a 
	Kamal Hossain of constitution or a Harold Lasky of political science to 
	comprehend them. Even a person who did not pass the matriculation exam 
	should be having no difficulties to conceive the violation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here again, conspiracy was so 
	evident that the President’s office did not have time even to invite the 
	leader of the opposition of the erstwhile parliament in the oath taking 
	ceremony while the Presidential staff had enough time to invite even the low 
	level leaders of the BNP led alliance. Even the member of the public did not 
	know who was going to be their ‘saviour of democracy’ until it was announced 
	by the cabinet secretary seconds before the ceremony. If this was not a 
	conspiracy, then what was it? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The aggrieved political leaders 
	filed a writ petition in the superior court challenging the constitutional 
	legality of Mr. Iajuddin’s assumption of the chief of the CTG, a 
	conventional avenue in any Republic where rule of law and constitution 
	prevail. After due hearings, when the judges were about to deliver their 
	ruling, the Attorney General (AG), a henchman of the BNP, personally 
	delivered an order on a plain paper from the Chief Justice (CJ) staying the 
	delivery of ruling, an unprecedented phenomenon in the country’s legal 
	chronicle. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the past, the same CJ allegedly 
	dismantled the HC benches more that a dozen times whenever a ruling was 
	issued against the government. What the CJ did in collusion with the AG on 
	November 30, which the constitutional expert Dr. Kamal Hossain has 
	attributed as ‘killing his own baby’ is a classical example fitting the 
	exact definition of conspiracy (I could be charged with contempt!). Did the 
	opposition political parties have any hand in that conspiracy? If the person 
	occupying the highest constitutional office of the Republic violates the 
	constitution, where else other than the highest court of the land a citizen 
	could seek redress? The broken doors and windows of the Supreme Court 
	premises could be repaired rapidly, but the justice which was denied its 
	normal course, in an issue of such national importance, could be beyond any 
	redemption. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The office of the President was the 
	last hope of the people of the Republic when all the other organs of the 
	State have been politicized and made crippled by the five year’s of 
	atrocious governance of the BNP led alliance. They even drove their own 
	party man out of the office of the President as soon he tried to become the 
	President of all citizens of the State rather than that of the party alone.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The former President Dr. B Chowdhury 
	had no constitutional or legal obligation to resign when the BNP 
	parliamentary party asked him to do so. The constitution has empowered the 
	parliament, not any political party, to impeach the President under a set of 
	well defined circumstances, none of which was applicable for President 
	Chowdhury. His decision to resign from his position was absolutely based on 
	ethical consideration since he realized that he, any more, did not carry the 
	confidence of the electorates who have elected him. On the same token, Mr. 
	Iajuddin Ahmed’s acceptance of the Presidency was an unethical act, since he 
	knew very well the reasons behind his predecessor’s departure from the 
	highest echelon of the State. Did the opponents of Khaleda Zia have any 
	conspiratorial hand in demeaning the sanctity of the highest constitutional 
	office of the Republic? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I met Mr. Iajuddin Ahmed some thirty 
	years ago in the residence of his fellow soil science graduate in Illinois 
	and was not at all impressed with his intellectual standing on any issues 
	relating to politics and society. Since he was hand picked by his mentor as 
	the President, his numerous activities clearly portrayed him as his master‘s 
	voice. As titular head of state, he was obediently carrying the wishes of 
	his mentor. Depth of his moral depravity could be evidently extrapolated 
	from his utterance of the name of our founding father as ‘Mujibur Rahman’ 
	(even his arch political rival addressed him as Sheikh Shaheb) in his last 
	written speech in the parliament. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On October 29, when he declared 
	himself the CA of the neutral CTG, baring the fact he was a loyal party 
	follower, citizens by and large expected that he would rise on to the 
	occasion, at the fag end of his life and career, and conduct himself to 
	uphold the letter and spirit of the CTG. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Contrary to their expectation, 
	Iajuddin Ahmed has shrouded himself in secrecy (along with his BNP appointed 
	staff without any shred of accountability and transparency) and has been 
	carrying out the acts of conspiracy one after another to implement the blue 
	print of his mentor bypassing the council of advisers, all whom collectively 
	constitute the CTG . He has blinded himself with such a degree of 
	inclination toward his mentor that his actions only prove that he is more 
	catholic than the Pope. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He has humiliated and betrayed some 
	of the finest persons of this nation, who in every way are incomparably more 
	gifted than him, to the point that they, by the urge of their conscience, 
	had to resign from their responsibilities. He has replaced them with a group 
	of ‘nationalists’ who have allegedly agreed not to differ with him in any of 
	his future actions, completing the full circle of conspiracy. Their initial 
	statements to media reporters reflected that their level of ‘competence’ is 
	no different from that of their new boss. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Iajuddin Ahmed has positioned 
	himself in the course of a despot, absolutely guided by his mentor, not by 
	any inkling of conscience, and is bent on carrying out acts that defy the 
	constitution, rule of law and ethics, thereby completely destroying the core 
	objective of the caretaker system. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even Hitler or Mussolini could have 
	been taken aback by the statement such as, ‘criticism of my personal staff 
	is tantamount to interference of the activities of the State’. Here again, 
	what Mr. Iajuddin is carrying out, sitting in Bangabhaban, including reading 
	his speech crafted by his mentor, (which even he does not have the physical 
	ability to read properly) when the whole nation sleeps, is the best case 
	that fits the definition of conspiracy. Do any of the detractors of Khaleda 
	Zia have any hand in those conspiracies? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I was listening to his live 
	speech at 12:00 noon at Toronto local time, it reminded me of another 
	speech, full of distortion and deception, delivered on March 27, 1971 by 
	another self-declared chief executive by the name of General Aga Mohammed 
	Yahia Khan squarely blaming Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the Bengali people for 
	all what happened in East Pakistan to justify the crack down. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The nation had to pay the lives of 3 
	millions of her worthy sons to prove him wrong by throwing him in the 
	dustbin of history. Iajuddin Ahmed has himself set his destiny in the 
	history and there would not be many around to mourn his eventuality. The 
	cruelty comes from the fact that the nation is set on a horrible course to 
	pay a heavy price for the dreadful acts of a person who neither possesses 
	the prudence, conscience and wisdom warranted from its first citizen nor did 
	have an iota of sacrifice for its painful creation</font></p>
