	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet, it was one more record setting 
	news for Bangladesh, but as usual not a good one. “Chad, Bangladesh Are Most 
	Corrupt”, read the heading of the October 18 issue of the New York Times. 
	This was the flashing news in many news agencies around the globe as soon as 
	the Transparency International (TI), the Berlin based watchdog body on 
	corruption released its report on Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of 2005. 
	NY times further wrote, “in Bangladesh, government agencies siphoned off a 
	reported $68 million through corruption last year, with the communications 
	sector the worst offender, the group (TI) said in September. Government 
	officials and senior bureaucrats were blamed in 72 percent of the cases 
	involving misuse of public funds in the South Asian nation. In terms of 
	bribes and misuse of power, the police department was responsible for nearly 
	17 percent of money lost, the earlier report said”. The Globe and Mail, 
	Canada’s elite news daily that includes the top business leaders in its 
	readership, that seldom cares to report the happenings in the developing 
	world, did not neglect, this time, to feature the story circulated by the 
	Reuter News agency that read, “Bangladesh, Chad come bottom of corruption 
	list”. Although this dubious distinction has been uninterruptedly bestowed 
	on the nation since 2001, this year the news release attracted extra 
	attention since Bangladesh has already been in the news map due to the 
	unprecedented internal violent activities over the past year and the record 
	setting terrorist bombings of August 17. TI has been publishing its CPI 
	ranking report since 1995. Bangladesh, featured first time in its list in 
	1996 ranking, secured the fourth berth from the bottom placing itself above 
	Nigeria, Pakistan, and Kenya among the 54 countries listed in the survey. 
	The next time Bangladesh’s name came up in the list was in 2001, which was 
	incidentally at the fag end of the AL rule and right before the last general 
	election. The top leaders of the then opposition party exploited the 
	humiliating news to their fullest advantage granting all the credit for this 
	dubious distinction to their adversaries. They attributed the TI report as 
	‘timely and beyond question’ and ‘was done on the basis of international 
	indices and not made to denigrate Bangladesh’. Between 1997 and 2000, 
	Bangladesh’s name was not included since TI requires data from at least 
	three independent sources to publish the ranking. However, in 2001, though 
	three sources were available for Bangladesh, but the data were so much 
	statistically unstable that the TI report included the only footnote in its 
	report for Bangladesh that read, “Data for this country in 2001 was 
	available from only three independent survey sources, and each of these 
	yielded very different results. While the composite score is 0.4, the range 
	of individual survey results is from -1.7 to +3.8. This is a greater range 
	than for any other country. TI stresses, therefore, that this result needs 
	to be viewed with caution”. In my article entitled, “CPI index: Basis and 
	Validity” (DS 17 July 2001), I vehemently questioned the statistical 
	validity of the data. The sources of the data were Freedom House, Price 
	Water House Coopers and World Business Environment Survey of the World Bank. 
	The variations between data values were so large that it gave a standard 
	deviation of 2.9 and standard error of 2.0. No other country’s data in the 
	last eleven years of TI’s history has generated such a high standard 
	deviation. It further generated a range over mean ratio of 14 and a 
	coefficient of variation (CV) of 725 per cent. The same parameter (CV) for 
	Canada, India and Pakistan (whose data had the second highest CV value) were 
	6 per cent, 18 per cent and 72 per cent respectively. A lower CV value 
	indicates a higher objectivity and scientific validity of the data. In 
	conclusion, I reemphasized, “one does not have to be a Fisher of statistics 
	to discard these unstable data, let alone using them in any scientific 
	analysis”. To show the instability of the data, if, for example, one survey 
	result out of three was taken out, Bangladesh would have an average score of 
	1.5 instead of 0.4 that would have changed the ranking drastically. In 
	statistical jargons, these are known as ‘corrupt data’. My viewpoints were 
	partly concurred with in the response by Prof. Dr Johann Graf Lambsdorff (TI 
	Adviser and director of the statistical work on the CPI) published in the 
	Daily Star, while his disagreement with my observations was technically 
	untenable as was indicated by me in my reactions published in the DS as 
	well. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The TI report of 2005 included 159 
	countries as opposed to 91 in 2001. More over, the country such as Chad, 
	with which Bangladesh shared the bottom berth, Turkmenistan, Myanmar and 
	Haiti that ranked right above Bangladesh were not included in 2001. This 
	time around, the data for Bangladesh were drawn from seven sources and 
	incidentally, none of these sources provided data for Bangladesh in 2001. 
	Each of these sources carried out surveys in 95 to 155 countries. Out of 
	these the World Economic Forum provide data for three consecutive years-- 
	2003, 2004 and 2005 based on its survey of senior business leaders, domestic 
	and international companies. This year’s data for Bangladesh yielded a mean 
	score of 1.7, a 90 per cent confidence range of 1.4 to 2.0 and a standard 
	deviation of 0.41 and standard error of 0.154. These resulted in a range 
	over mean ratio of 0.35 (14 in 2001) and a CV of 24 per cent (725 in 2001). 
	Therefore, from the statistical perspective, there is nothing to contest so 
	far the validity and the stability of the data is concerned. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our politicians, especially those 
	who are in the helm of the State, try to invent conspiracy in every critical 
	report or review that either appears in the international press such as 
	Bertil Lintner’s one on rising Islamic fundamentalism in the Far Eastern 
	Economic Review or comes out of the foreign capital such as TI report on 
	Corruption. The unparalleled incident of August 17 and October 3 and the 
	subsequent bone-chilling revelations by the suspected mastermind only helped 
	to prove the accuracy of Lintner’s story. The day-to-day experience of the 
	people who are enduring the burnt of endemic corruption only validates the 
	findings of the TI report. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the TI report appeared in 2001, 
	the then government pointed its finger to a highly vocal trustee of TIB for 
	his alleged conspiracy to release the report right before the general 
	election notwithstanding the fact that the TI report was neither prepared 
	for nor intended to release in Bangladesh only. Ironically, a minister of 
	the present government whose ministry has been identified as the ‘worst 
	offender’ by TIB imputing the very individual as one of those who are trying 
	to portray Bangladesh as a ‘failed state’. The very politicians in whose 
	ears the TI report sounded like sweet music in 2001 became high-pitched 
	noise thereafter, not only once, but also for four consecutive years since 
	their ascendancy to power in 2001. Now the minister who once opined that the 
	TI report ‘was not made to denigrate Bangladesh’ is now brandishing the 
	organization as one whose ‘brain has to be examined’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although TI report is not intended 
	to make a comparative study of the performance of successive governments of 
	any country, consecutive ranking of Bangladesh at the bottom of the list, a 
	unique feat, does not bode well for the performance of current government in 
	reflecting its resolve to fight corruption vis-à-vis its predecessor. This 
	government published hundred of pages of white papers elaborating the 
	corruptions of its predecessor. However, neither the people of the country 
	nor the international bodies did find any trace of indications reflecting 
	any flattening trend of the positive slope of the corruption curve, let 
	alone reversing it, since the publication of the white papers. In fact, the 
	newspaper reports expose only a tip of the iceberg of the corruptions 
	stories that circulate around. None of the stories that involve the 
	corruption of the government leaders and their family members have ever been 
	contested or dispelled by the government through any credible investigations 
	or explanations. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A few comparisons involving the 
	current government and its predecessor in their public actions to arrest 
	corruption would be in proper order. During the tenure of the past AL 
	government, DIT plots were allotted mostly to the AL leaders, which the 
	newspapers dubbed as ‘Awami Village’. After severe criticisms from the news 
	media, the then PM, through an executive order, cancelled the allotments. 
	Exactly the same irregularities were repeated during the current government 
	when the DIT plots were allotted mostly to the BNP supporters. In spite of 
	the similar criticisms from the media, the present PM did not bother to 
	follow suit. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There was no alternate centre of 
	power during the tenure of the past government as it exists to day, and 
	which, in views of the government’s detractors, has stakes in most big 
	businesses and government contracts. The erstwhile PM’s son did not own any 
	business in the country; neither did he borrow any money from the country’s 
	bank. To the contrary, there are reports all over about the current PM’s 
	sons owning multiple businesses and big investments, at both home and 
	abroad. Only on the other day, the leader of the opposition accused the 
	government of writing off hundred of millions taka of interest of the loans 
	owed to PM’s sons by the nation’s bank. It was incumbent on a democratically 
	elected government with the slightest transparency and accountability to 
	contest the accusation, if it did not have any merit, specially when it came 
	from the official leader of the opposition and former PM. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A TIB trustee while publishing the 
	report at Dhaka has asked both the current and the former PMs to disclose 
	their assets publicly. The former PM has not only agreed to the suggestion 
	but has gone a step further by challenging that the assets of the PM’s son, 
	a political heir apparent, should be also included in the declaration. It is 
	now the turn of the PM to accept the challenge of her adversary and let the 
	people of the country as well as the international bodies know who amassed 
	how much wealth during their political career since both of them had humble 
	starts some quarter of a century ago.</font></p>
