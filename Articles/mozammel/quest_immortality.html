	<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-CA">Attaining immortality is a never 
	ending quest for mortal human being at all ages. Naming of institutions to 
	commemorate persons for their everlasting contribution to a society in 
	particular and mankind in general, is a well accepted practice followed in 
	every society. Kings, queens, politicians, scientists, philosophers, artists 
	and others those who, one way or the others made some long run differences 
	through their contributions to any specific arena of the society are usually 
	honoured affixing their names to institutions that closely identify their 
	fields of bestowals. In all societies, donors also occupy an important place 
	among the icons whose names glorify the institutions so named after them. 
	However, if any name, especially if the person is still actively living, 
	becomes reminiscence of any negative correlation with any positive virtue 
	that undeniably creates a very faltering image of the institution that 
	labels his name. &nbsp;Max Planck Institute certainly speaks volumes of the 
	scientific standing of the organization while the Rabindra Bharati 
	University amplifies manifolds the glory appended to that particular 
	institution.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-CA">In every society where ethics has not been totally made a 
	repugnant probity, a few norms are being practiced in naming the organs of 
	the body of national importance; especially when dealing with the names of 
	the politicians who still occupy the helm of power. In Western democracies, 
	no institution is ever carried the name of a sitting President or a Prime 
	Minister and for that matter, they are rare instances to honour even a 
	living former President or Prime Minister (PM) by affixing their names with 
	any institution, no matter how much their efforts were effective in bringing 
	out or flourishing of the body in question. A rare exception is only 
	exhibited in the United States where, as a traditional practice, a library 
	is set up in his home town, mostly with private donations, bearing the name 
	of the outgoing chief executive. The most illustrious Canadian Statesman 
	Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s name was never exhibited to any roads, public 
	buildings or organs of any academic institutions not only during his tenure 
	as one of the longest serving Prime Ministers of Canada or even thereafter 
	as a retired ombudsman of this great democracy, albeit his popularity as the 
	principal architect of the legendary Charter of Rights and Freedom, was 
	never surpassed. Only after his death a few years ago, a Montreal airport 
	was named after him and recently, University of Toronto, Canada’s largest 
	university, has glorified itself by naming an academic building after him.

	<span lang="EN-CA">Closer to home, there is not a single establishment in 
	Singapore that carries the name of Lee Kwan Yew, the architect of modern 
	Singapore. There was a proposal to name the Changi Airport of Singapore, 
	incidentally the best airport of the world for more than a decade and that 
	boastfully hangs the portrait a few Asian makers of history such as Mahatma 
	Gandhi, Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Min and Bangabandhu, after him which was 
	immediately turned down Mr. Lee himself. No government office or institution 
	ever carried the picture of Mr. Lee even when he was the PM. The pictures of 
	the President, no matter how titular the position is, always glorify the 
	walls of the government offices and its missions overseas. In Canada as 
	well, no one has ever seen the picture of the PM glorifying the walls of any 
	office or institutions. Turkey, a country which, like Bangladesh, has also 
	seen a lot of ups and downs in democratic practices, has an exemplary 
	tradition of hanging only the portrait of Mustafa Kamal, the father of 
	modern Turkey; while naming an institution after an activate political 
	leader is a far cry. Bangladesh is probably the only country among the 
	Westminster democracies where the current parliament has passed a law making 
	it mandatory for the government offices to hang the portrait of the PM, lest 
	people dishonour their elected leader! Incidentally, Sheikh Hasina deserves 
	the distinct honour among our PMs and Presidents whose portrait did not 
	dangle on the office buildings, nor did any institution bear her name, 
	during her tenure as the PM. In fact, her government’s decision to hang only 
	the portrait of Bangabandhu, the father of our nation, was a very prudent 
	one to bestow the long-deserved honour to the greatest national hero of the 
	land. </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-CA">During the Presidency of Late Ziaur Rahman, in addition 
	to two other widely-acclaimed virtues, namely the personal honesty and non- 
	adherence to nepotism, he strictly maintained the policy of not allowing any 
	one to honour him by naming any institution after him. Soon after his tragic 
	death, the government of the day went on a naming spree and according to a 
	statistics by early 1996, just before the fall of the BNP government, there 
	were around 500 institutions that carried Ziaur Rahman’s name. It was not 
	only the name of Ziaur Rahman, who must have been turning in his grave to 
	feel how all these cherished virtues, for which he is highly regarded, have 
	been nullified by his successors, his widow as the PM did not spare any 
	opportunity to inaugurate the institutions exhibiting her name. Most of the 
	universities, including the Rajshahi and the Islamic, which have a female 
	dormitory constructed during her tenure, brooked her name. Many of her 
	ministers were not lagging behind her either to glorify themselves by 
	ascribing their names to anything that was built during their rule. In my 
	visit to Dhaka in early nineties, I watched on BTV news that a minister was 
	inaugurating an auditorium bearing his name in his home town, 
	notwithstanding the minister was miserably defeated in the election in both 
	of his home ridings. Two years ago, in my journey through Dhaka city, I came 
	across a College bearing the name of a current cabinet minister whose name 
	in any way never rekindles even the minimum probity expected from a human 
	soul. </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-CA">The current controversy emanated from the proposed naming 
	of a female dormitory of Dhaka University after the name of the current PM 
	defying the long and highly acclaimed tradition of not naming any element of 
	this great university after the name of any living human being. The said 
	dormitory was allegedly proposed to be named during the tenure of the 
	erstwhile government after late Begum Sufia Kamal, an imminent female icon 
	of our nation. There are ongoing arguments and counter arguments, in which 
	who donated the state property for the dormitory, either the present PM or 
	the former PM came into play, as if it was their personal property. The PM 
	must be enjoying the debates since majority of the senate members are in 
	favour of her name; a great quest to reach immortality indeed!&nbsp; </span>

	<span lang="EN-CA">During the tenure of the last AL government, neither of 
	the names given by the preceding BNP government was renamed, although the 
	BNP government was once overthrown through a mass upsurge. The current 
	alliance government did not reciprocate that civilized norm practiced by the 
	AL government which went out of the helm only through a normal democratic 
	exercise. Even the M A Hannan airport and the Syed Nazul Islam (who was he?) 
	bridge were renamed. If the BNP ever has to evacuate the helm of authority 
	and if a non-BNP government pays them back in the same coin, what would be 
	BNP’s option to counter that tit for tat move? It might call hartal, as it 
	did when a pontoon bridge linking Ziaur Rahman’s mausoleum was removed from 
	the lake, or resort to a few street demonstrations. However, would it help 
	it to regain the lost moral ground? People in the helm of power seldom 
	address that question.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
