	<span lang="EN-CA">I read the abridged version of your address, entitled ‘If 
	I could be the chairman of the Anti-corruption commission’, through the 
	courtesy of an English language Daily. I am attributing the content of your 
	address a ‘Dream’, not a Utopia. At the outset, I must apologize for not 
	sharing your happiness and, according to your own claim, the happiness of 
	the citizens of the country at the formation of the Anti-Corruption 
	Commission (ACC). We have seen many such commissions, one even headed by 
	Justice Sultan Hossain Khan himself, over the years. However, the report of 
	any such commissions never saw the light of the day. It is a widely 
	conceived perception that the core of our corruption is situated at the 
	nucleus of the government, regardless of the party in power. Does one have 
	to be a graduate of the Kennedy school of government to apprehend that a 
	government, in its good sense, would create a commission to expose of and 
	punish for its own mischief? Nevertheless, I am giving you the complete 
	benefit of doubt that the ACC was formed with a noble intention to 
	annihilate corruption and you would be given the absolute authority to 
	choose your own human resources, including its Secretary, and you would have 
	the full authority to draw your required financial resources from the 
	national exchequer.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-CA">Your whole wish-list is based on a scenario that sounds 
	very much foreign to Bangladesh. While reading through it, I thought for a 
	while you must be dreaming yourself to be working in Helsinki or Singapore, 
	a much closer destination from geo-cultural consideration. It seems you are 
	very much indifferent (not ignorant) to unique position Bangladesh holds 
	among the community of un(failed) states. If you have the statistics under 
	your hold, you will discover that the lawmakers of Bangladesh spent the 
	highest amount of money, only next to US, to get elected to the parliament, 
	while a lawmaker in Finland (the least corrupt nation according to TI) or 
	Singapore (the least corrupt country in Asia) spends, on an average, a 
	meagre ten thousand dollars to get elected to serve the nation as a 
	lawmaker. Is there any country on the globe, which itself claims to be a 
	democracy, a person convicted for corruption and was guilty of aiding an 
	extra-constitutional usurpation of the state power through unconstitutional 
	dissolution of the parliament, appointed as the minister to the important 
	portfolio no less than the law and parliamentary affairs itself? This is a 
	country where the partisan zeal is so naked that a law professor, who 
	supposedly teaches law, writes columns supporting killing by so-called 
	‘crossfire’, a flagrant disregard for the rule of law. This is the country 
	where we find dearth of judges to try even the self-confessed killers of a 
	man whose voice, in your own words, ‘was strong enough to quell the 
	sophisticated fire power of the Pakistanis’. The people of this country are 
	so much forgivable (may be forgetful) that even the alleged war criminals 
	are voted to run the helm of the State within a short span of thirty years. 
	The list will never be an exhaustive one. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">In your model dream you have made a very flawed 
	assumption. Yes, every citizen supports the ACC as long as he himself is 
	outside the loop. Our people seldom cherish the concept of self-criticisms. 
	The most horrendous truth is that corruption is not a social stigma in our 
	society. The dignity and power of an individual is decided by the amount of 
	money he holds. If one has the money, he can acquire dignity and power; 
	people hardly care how the money was earned. A former dictator, who was 
	overthrown from power through a mass movement and was subsequently convicted 
	of corruption of multiple counts, a rare occurrence in our system, is still 
	a very worthy person and both the government and the opposition are trying 
	hard to court him. Recent inhuman and utterly uncivilized acts of the 
	government involving his wife only shows how much the government values his 
	presence in its fold. In any other society, where even the faintest civility 
	exists, he would be a man of oblivion.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-CA">In your dream plan you want to bring people back to the 
	fold of honesty through reward, an imaginative proposition indeed! In no 
	other society the proverb, ‘<i>chora na sone dharmer kahini’ </i>&nbsp;(‘black 
	will take no other hue’) is more appropriately applicable than in our 
	beloved Bangladesh. So that recourse of yours would be doomed only to elude 
	ridicules. Between two persons working in the same job, the one with honesty 
	(naturally poor) is considered a worthless ‘idiot’ even by his close family 
	members, let alone by the rest of the society. I am scared to death with 
	your idea to form ‘Sufferers Association’, you expect whose members to come 
	to ACC with evidence. Did you not know the fate the poor Nuruzzaman had to 
	endure by bringing a simple allegation of bribery demand by the son of a 
	minister? As a citizen, let alone an illustrious one, I did not read any 
	words of sympathy or protest from you to rescues Nuruzzanan from the 
	torturous arms of the State Machinery. It was no other than Irene Khan, the 
	chief of the Amnesty International, who had to issue statement of 
	condemnation in favour of the poor sufferer. How many of your citizens, who 
	you believe are your ‘human resources’, came out with any words of sympathy 
	or empathy, let alone coming down to the street to protest against the 
	torture? Do you still remember the name of a now obscured man, who as the 
	Secretary to the PM issued merely a memo ordering an investigation into an 
	allegation of irregularities, in which among others, the PM’s son was 
	allegedly involved? Did you or any other member of the so-called civil 
	society came out supporting his noble initiative or provide him any moral 
	support in his effort to rescue himself from the wrath of the government? As 
	a highly informed person about the affairs around the globe, you surely 
	remember how Mark Thatcher’s business deal was investigated without any fear 
	or fervour by the British government officials when his mother, the iron 
	lady, was the all powerful PM of the British Isles?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-CA">If there would be a mean to conduct any gall up poll in 
	Bangladesh, as it exists in any other democracies, and if there would be 
	such a poll to find the most corrupt individual in the country, there is 
	hardly any disagreement among the observers who that person would be. Did 
	the perceived notion among the people about his monumental corruption create 
	any dent in the ‘popularity’ of the party that he virtually leads? If the 
	answer is a nay, that by itself negates your statement that “<i>all the 
	people of </i></span><i><span lang="EN-CA">Bangladesh sincerely support ACC</span></i><span lang="EN-CA">”. 
	This obvious paradox once again attests that the people of Bangladesh are 
	your worst weakness, not the ‘biggest strength’.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">The most notable and encouraging exception to our all 
	pervasive society is our fourth estate, the media. They have kept our hope 
	alive by publishing stories compared to which the ‘Tahelka.com’ sounds like 
	a Robin Hood story, albeit these are only the tips of the iceberg of 
	corruption that has engulfed our nation. In the process Bangladesh has 
	become the most dangerous place for the journalists to work in the last 
	three years. But what difference does it make to any one, Professor Yunus? 
	After the publications of the stories of corruption of a senior minister of 
	hundred of crores of taka, a parliamentary committee, comprising the members 
	of his own party was formed to investigate the allegation. However, people 
	of the country have never known the fate of that committee or its findings, 
	if there are any. As if that was enough, only last year the same minister 
	donated thirty crores worth of a state property to an NGO headed by his wife 
	and publicly defended his ‘generous’ action in the face of severe criticisms 
	from many quarters. Only on the other day, an opposition MP was enticed to 
	join the main component of the ruling alliance in return for paying of his 
	invoice amounting to a staggering fourteen crores, which the government owed 
	him. If such a story would be published in the news media of any other 
	democracies, what would be the fate of the government, Professor Yunus? In 
	Singapore,&nbsp; a finance minister of the then PM Lee Kwan Yew’s cabinet 
	committed suicide when some financial irregularities involving the minister 
	appeared in the news media.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">I fully identify myself with your determination when you 
	say, “I would terrorise those areas so ferociously that people would have to 
	think twice before getting engaged in corruption” or “my big job will be 
	creating fear in the minds of the corrupt people, not for the time being&nbsp; 
	but permanently”. How would you do that, Prof Yunus? You have only jaws, but 
	not the teeth. Your mandate is limited to investigation and framing charges; 
	you have no power to prosecute any one. You must admit that an impartial 
	(independence is a frightening authority without impartiality) judiciary is 
	the minimum pre-requisite to dispense proper justice, since it could be 
	hardly overemphasized that the unflinching execution of law is the most 
	effective deterrent against potential defiance of it. Over the&nbsp; years the 
	anti corruption bureau has framed charges against hundreds of individuals, 
	but the people of the country have seen not many convictions. Many of the 
	cases have been withdrawn by executive orders while the rest of them have 
	been outright quashed by the higher court, apparently due to the absence of 
	merit, in the judgements of the judges, in the charges. Discounting the 
	complexities of evidences in many such cases, it is beyond the comprehension 
	of any ordinary citizen how a simple case in which the present PM allegedly 
	spent 8.6 million from the national exchequer to repair her private 
	residence was outright quashed by the High court as soon the PM regained the 
	state power. Another former PM (of the fallen dictator), who was convicted 
	in a corruption case in the lower court, is enjoying an eternal bail from 
	the high court. During his time in freedom, he took shelter in Australia and 
	collected welfare cheques from the Australian government, a great image 
	building exercise by a former PM for his motherland indeed! Over the last 
	few weeks, as a trusted friend of the current government, he has been seen 
	to be working as the king makers of the future government. With the highly 
	politicized judiciary on your side, you may be able to obtain, at best, a 
	conviction of a poor loan defaulter from some remote village of the country. 
	Unfortunately, the age-old saying that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ 
	is not more vividly applicable to any other place than Bangladesh.&nbsp; To the 
	contrary, during the long years of rule by oxford educated&nbsp; Lee Kwan Yew or 
	during the current Premiership of his worthy son Harvard educated Lee Hsien&nbsp; 
	Loong, it would be to rare to discover even a&nbsp; single case in the archive 
	which has been quashed by the court of law in Singapore. If we were 
	fortunate to have executive and judicial organs that could emulate those of 
	Singapore even to a little extent, you would have good reasons to feel 
	‘jealous of Justice Sultan Hossain Khan’. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-CA">Notwithstanding, if you would still go ahead to 
	materialize your plan and persist with your mission to investigate the 
	corruption of the rich and powerful, I apprehend two dreadful situations 
	waiting for you. In the more palatable of the two, you may meet the fate no 
	better than the President of the Republic, once a faithful party loyalist, 
	whose only fault was to obey the constitution of the Republic. In the other 
	scenario, God forbids, you could be the victim of some lethal grenade 
	attack, a very common phenomenon in today’s Bangladesh. If that misfortune 
	happens, leaders around the globe, including the UN chief, would send 
	messages of condolence and condemnation to the PM and would demand an 
	independent enquiry, even by FBI. If there would be a judicial enquiry, we 
	would know from the leaked information in the media that some unknown 
	foreign power was involved; the power which got envied with the respect that 
	Professor Yunus brought in the international arena for Bangladesh. However, 
	if there would be a police enquiry, a charge sheet would be submitted that 
	would probably involve an accused like Qayum of some obscured Upazilla, who 
	as aggrieved, planned to annihilate this internationally reputed son of the 
	soil, since as the Chairman of the ACC he ordered for an investigation of 
	his improper business deals. For Heaven’s sake we do not want that dreadful 
	tragedy to happen, Professor Yunus.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
