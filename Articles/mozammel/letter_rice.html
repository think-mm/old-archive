	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The alliance government of 
	Bangladesh and Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed who writes from the town of Princeton 
	have a number of things in common: both are in a state of denial, both are 
	in ostrich like attitude, both are in constant pursuit to invent conspiracy 
	whenever something is published outside our borders depicting the 
	reprehensible state of affairs of Bangladesh and both are in complete tune 
	in accusing our citizens of conducting smear campaign if one raises the 
	despicable human rights situation in the country in any international forum. 
	In an earlier write-up in the Daily Star (DS), he dismissed the NY Times 
	story of Eliza Griswold entitled, ‘Bangladesh: The next Islamic Revolution?’ 
	and inferred the whole story a conspiracy against Bangladesh. After what 
	happened on August 17, and the subsequent and ongoing startling revelations 
	in the news media including the DS, I was expecting that Dr. Fakhruddin 
	would make an apology to his readers for his incomplete perceptions about 
	the existence of the extremist elements and their evil designs. Quite to the 
	contrary, he has even gone one-step ahead of the government of Bangladesh in 
	cutting aspersion on the authenticity of the letter written to Dr. 
	Condoleezza Rice by sixteen distinguished lawmakers of the US congress. A 
	government spokesperson of Bangladesh has responded to the letter that 
	affirmed that the government did not have any doubt about its authenticity. 
	Even the PM in her recent speech, in commensurate with her usual 
	vocabularies, in Bangladesh Embassy in NY made an oblique reference through 
	her accusations that “the ill-campaigners are organising seminars and 
	meetings abroad to establish the one-sided and false allegations with the 
	help of politicians of foreign countries who are sympathetic to them”. The 
	letter visibly outraged Dr. Fakhruddin, which was obvious through his, 
	rather incoherent reactions. On the one hand, he blamed the Bangladeshi who, 
	in his view, orchestrated this anti-Bangladesh campaign, and took an 
	extremely critical views of the observations made in the letter, while, on 
	the other, raising the apprehension if the legislators ‘did actually sign 
	the letter’, an incredulity that overtly undermines the integrity and 
	accountability of some of the US politicians from both side of the political 
	divides, any of whom has the potential and prospect of becoming the next 
	President of the United States. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his research to find the 
	geographical identity of lawmakers, his conclusion was ‘bizarre’: ‘most of 
	the lawmakers come from the New England area and some one or some groups are 
	orchestrating anti-Bangladeshi smear campaign’. As a former Rhodes Scholar 
	Dr. Fakhruddin miserably failed to distinguish between the State and the 
	government. If the criticisms against the policies and the wrong doings of 
	the Bush Administration are considered smear campaign against America, then 
	Dr. Fakhruddin’s name should feature in the forefront of that list of the 
	‘anti-Americans’ and Fahrenheit 911 famed Michael Moore, who portrayed the 
	ugly face of the US government to the billions of audience around the globe 
	should be tried for treason. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Because of the Bush administration’s 
	ill-intended policies and attitude towards the rest of the world, albeit 
	George Bush is the elected President of the United States, respect for 
	Jefferson’s America is never been at such low ebb in the international 
	arena. Being disenchanted by the faltering image of their beloved country 
	and finding no other internal avenues to redress the situations, if a group 
	of Americans urge the UN to censure Bush Administration’s policy, will Dr. 
	Fakhruddin, presumably an American citizen, add his chore to those voices or 
	term their effort as an act of ‘smear campaign’ against US? The maverick 
	independent MP of the British House of Commons George Galloway in his 
	crusade against the labour party goverenment brought his case to the western 
	side of the Atlantic. Only the other day, he was cheered by thousand of 
	students of Canada’s biggest univerysity when he delivered a fiery speech 
	castigating the catastrophic policy of the Bush-Blair administrations. 
	Neither the British government nor any of its citizens ever accused Mr. 
	Galloway of mounting smear campaign aginst his motherland. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his own admission it is clear to 
	Dr. Fakhruddin that ‘those who stand to gain by Bangladesh becoming a failed 
	state promote and pereptuate the myth that Bangladesh is well on its towards 
	national suicide’. It would be natural to enquire the indentity of the 
	elements who stand to gain from Bangladesh becoming a failed state. Is he 
	pointing his finger to Senetor Kennedy, who travelled all the way to our 
	devastated land in 1971 to express his support and solidarity with our life 
	and death struggle for freedom, or to the freedom fighter who moved from 
	village to village in the occupied land with curbides in his shoulder to 
	free his mother land from the foreign occupation or to the school girl, who 
	happens to teach in Boston Univeristy now, donated his tiffin allowance to 
	the cause of Bangladesh’s creation? In fact, one does not have to be a 
	Rhodes scholar to concieve the hypothesis that those who opposed the 
	creation of Bangladesh stand to gain from its failure of becoming a viable 
	state in order to prove that the they did nothing wrong by opposing its 
	creation in the first place. It is worth noting that the debate of ‘failed 
	state’ started during the tenure of the current alliance government; it was 
	never featured even during the regime of martial or quasi-martial law, which 
	the people of Bangladesh, unfortunately, had to endure during half of its 
	life since its inception. Moreover, Dr. Fakhruddin should not be on the 
	receiving end of the lecture in identifying the perpetrators when a State is 
	considered failed. Are these the people who are in the helm of the State or 
	those who are out of it? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Fakhruddin commented that as in 
	neighbouring countries, political and religious violence are facts of life 
	in Bangladesh. In which other democracy in our neighbourhood when grenades 
	after grenades are thorown in the public rally, at broad daylight, pointing 
	to the leader of the opposition and former PM, killing and wounding 
	hundreds, law enforcing agencies, instead of rescuing the victims, would 
	fire tear gas? Whose interest was served by this nefarous acts of the police 
	force? How one could dismiss the natural inference about the collusion of 
	the authority with the perpetrators? Dr.Fakhruddin is irked by the 
	prominence that Slain Mr. Kibria received in the letter, overlooking the 
	full contents that Sheikh Hasina and British HC received due importance as 
	well. He also found fault with the lawmakers’ inaction as regard to the case 
	of Narinder Modi of Gujrat. In fact, Narinder Modi is already in the 
	criminal list of the state department who has been denied US visa. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is wrong with the US lawmakers’ 
	comments that ‘the lower courts are under the authority of the executive and 
	they lack independence’? Does Dr. Fakhruddin want to deny this well-known 
	fact? In fact, the US lawmakers did not touch on the Bangladesh’s higher 
	judiciary, which has been blatantly politicised by the current 
	administration. It was ridiculous that Dr. Fakhruddin drew a parallel 
	between the appointments of judges in US Supreme Court with those under the 
	current administration in Bangladesh. Most of the judges in the US Supreme 
	Court possess illustrious legal career with their formal education received 
	in Harvard, Yale or similar reputed education institutions. Their 
	differences come not from their affiliation to the Republican or the 
	Democratic parties; they differ on social and constitutional issues. In 
	addition, they are so much grilled during the Senate confirmation hearing 
	that the whole nation comes to know about their past records and their 
	standing on unsettled social and constitutional issues. They never felt 
	embarrassed to hear the appeal of the self-confessed killers of a victim as 
	because the victim incidentally believed in a political faith different from 
	their own. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In conclusion Dr. Fakhruddin asked 
	the Bangladesh government to verify the authenticity of the letter, which I 
	believe, the government with its multiple mission offices in US soil has 
	done so. The Daily Star possesses an extended periphery of readerships that 
	extends beyond the national boundary of Bangladesh. Only on the other day, 
	David Boster Jr., a US citizen, issued a rejoinder in response to a story by 
	Lawrence Lifschultz. On a similar token, my article questioning the 
	statistical validity of CPI data to declare Bangladesh as the most corrupt 
	country of the world in 2001 prompted a response from the Transparency 
	International head quarter in Berlin. We even did not have the perception 
	that fraudulency can occur in the communiqué that is customarily being 
	issued about the outcomes of a talk between two foreign leaders until we 
	read a protest statement issued by Senator Kennedy regarding his talk with 
	Bangladesh government’s minister of Home affairs. Being a US citizen and 
	residing at a vantage point in New Jersey, transparency of American 
	democracy should give him little trouble to verify the authenticity of the 
	letter. If his apprehension is not true, and if the statement was made ‘to 
	oblige the constituent', Dr Fakhruddin who seemingly possesses an 
	unflinching trust on the Bangladesh government’s records on Human Rights, 
	Liberal Democracy, Rule of Law, the RAB actions of extra-judicial denial of 
	right to life, dysfunctional parliament, total politicization of every organ 
	of the state, including the election commission and the higher judiciary, 
	surely he could obtain a few testimonials, ‘a routine service to their 
	constituents’, from his Senators such as Frank Lautenberg and Robert 
	Torricelli of New Jersey endorsing his own views on those burning issues. It 
	would be, indeed, a befitting reciprocation to counter the ‘anti-Bangladeshi 
	campaign’ allegedly waged by his compatriots residing in US soil!</font></p>
