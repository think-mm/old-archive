	conspiracies, any of which might have far-reaching social and political 
	implications if true. In a political sense, conspiracy refers to a group of

	political power. </span></font></p>
	<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN">During the Pakistani era the conspiracy theories were 
	frequently put forward against the politicians who were not ready to dance 
	in tune with the wishes of the vested rulers. The most famous (on infamous) 
	conspiracy case in our land was the so-called Agartala conspiracy case 
	brought against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 34 others Bengali civil and 
	military officers, which in total contrast with the design of the then 
	rulers, turned out to refuel the flame of our quest&nbsp; for independence. The 
	successive regimes of the independent Bangladesh have used the conspiracy 
	theories, at various extents, against their political opponents to malign 
	the intentions even of their genuine political agenda. The allegations of 
	conspiracy theories reached its peak during the past era of the BNP-Jamat 
	government. </span>The government would see the hands of conspiracy behind 
	all the big bomb blasts and political actions of the opposition in the 
	country and implicate reputed persons and politicians with charges that were 
	to eventually prove false and fabricated.</font></p>
	<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Bangladesh is currently under the reign of a unique government whose members 
	or its visible backers are presumed to have no political ambitions. It is 
	more or less a national consensus that the January 11 takeover was the best 
	course of action given any other possible options. The prime destiny of this 
	government is to transfer power to a government elected through a free and 
	fair election and the EC is believed to be working relentlessly towards 
	meeting the goal of their widely publicized roadmap. Any political party 
	that relies on people’s support to step into the helm of the government or 
	any individual desires or demands the country’s early return to democratic 
	rule will be only helping in its effort to accelerate its march through the 
	roadmap rather than destabilizing the government that could only create 
	hindrance to achieving its principal goal. Even a street urchin of 
	Bangladesh knows what awaits next if this government fails. In that 
	unfortunate likelihood, history tells us that the parties with no strong 
	mass footings or individuals possessing volatile and flimsy political belief 
	get the opportunity to flourish their fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most 
	serious challenge of the government came during and in the aftermath of 
	unfortunate Dhaka University incident. As promised by CA in his address to 
	the nation, a single member judicial commission was formed to investigate 
	the incident. It was believed that, departing from the ill-practices of the 
	past political government, the CTG would act according to the findings and 
	recommendations of the commission. However, to our utter disappointment, we 
	heard, even before the commission started its work, from no other than the 
	army chief that a ‘conspiracy’ was offing by “the evil forces to destabilize 
	the situation by creating anarchy and undermining the image of the 
	government.”&nbsp; Such a disclosure from the army chief before completion of the 
	judicial investigation greatly undermines the process, reflects its 
	redundancy and creates apprehension if the commission’s report would really 
	see the light of the day, if its findings contradict his assertions. The 
	government in an unprecedented move has already sued and arrested a number 
	of highly respected teachers of the universities, which no other government 
	ever endeavoured to do since the British left the subcontinent in 1947. All 
	the arrested teachers possess some sort of association or sympathy for some 
	major political parties, (my Canadian professor colleague is running for MPP 
	in the ensuing election) and it is obvious that their<span lang="EN-CA"> 
	favoured</span> party’s interest will be best served with the early and 
	proper implementation of EC’s roadmap, not by any means creating any 
	roadblock or destabilizing the government. A simple hindsight would negate 
	their involvement in any alleged conspiracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another 
	conspiracy theory has been popped up by the law adviser Mainul Hosein</font><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">
	</span><font face="Verdana">while</font><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333"> 
	r</span><font face="Verdana">eacting to publishing a cartoon in ‘Alpin’ of 
	Prothom Alo. The adviser asserted, “there is a conspiracy to create a 
	dangerous and unwanted situation; everyone has to remain united against the 
	conspiracy to destabilize the country.” His contention should have been 
	cautious to extinguish the flame of ignorance rather igniting it. After 
	living in the heartland of the Arab world, the birth place of our great 
	religion, for eleven years I have identified many of our ignorance vis-à-vis 
	the true doctrines and practices of Islam. Eluding any debate on the issue, 
	albeit the cartoon reflected a satire on ignorance rather than any ignominy 
	of religious spirit, it is beyond any comprehension why the country’s most 
	widely circulated Bengali Daily will indulge itself into a conspiracy 
	against the government that enjoys its most vociferous support. What benefit 
	the young cartoonist and the in-charge editor of the ‘Alpin’ would have 
	reaped from destabilizing the country, if at all that would be possible? The 
	editor of Prothom Alo, confessing the responsibility as the editor, has 
	publicly and personally apologized through various media and the matter 
	should be settled there. By the same token, the young cartoonist should be 
	freed since the lion share of the burden, if any, lies with the editor, not 
	the contributor of any published media. Reportedly a very similar cartoon 
	appeared in a monthly magazine published by Jamati Islami’s student wing in 
	November 1998. Neither did the then government initiate any legal action 
	against any one nor did any one make any hue and cry out of it.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p style="background: #F8FCFF" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Conspiracy theory is the reclusion of the morally weak and dejected rulers 
	and has never been a plausible hypothesis. Any government that boasts to 
	enjoy the support of the masses never has to resort to propagating an 
	implausible proposition. </font></p>
