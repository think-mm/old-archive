	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the otherwise dismal scenario of 
	communal amity one good initiative by Sant Gyandas of Hanuman Gardhi, the 
	biggest temple of Ayodhya, had come as a whip of fresh air. Three years ago 
	he invited the local Muslims for Roza iftar in the temple premises. He 
	repeated it the next year as well. Meanwhile to match these sentiments one 
	Babu bhai from Muslim community took the initiative of Hanuman chalisa 
	recital on Id Milan. One Madhuban Das, not to be left behind, went on to 
	distribute Ram Rahim chadars to people. The Muslim community which earlier 
	in the wake of the proposed Kar Seva was planning to abandon Ayodhya out of 
	fear felt reassured and stayed on. This year, under the influence of VHP a 
	section of Hanuman Garhi mahants filed a case in the court that such Roza 
	Iftar is against the by laws of the temple, and court ruled in their favor. 
	Also, many a VHP activists sat on a Dharna in front of Hanuman Garhi to 
	oppose the Muslims entry into the temple premises for the Roza Iftar party.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is the worth of efforts of the 
	likes of Mahant Gyan Das or various other groups who are trying to bring 
	different religious communities together through such festive occasions, 
	through mutual respect for each other’s sentiments? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A thriving democracy, needs the 
	principles of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity (community) as the base of 
	its existence. In India we have seen mauling of these values under the 
	impact of a politics, which derives its legitimacy from the religious 
	identity of the people. With rising pitch of communal violence the physical 
	and emotional polarization of communities along religious lines has been 
	taking place. In places like Mumbai, post 92-93 the Muslim dominated areas 
	have come to be called a ‘Mini Pakistan’, in Ahmadabad the Muslim majority 
	area is called, ‘border’ and one hears that Muslim localities are also being 
	called as Gaza strip. Post 92-93 Mumbai violence, a huge chunk of Muslim 
	population living in mixed localities shifted to places like Mumbra and 
	Jogeshwari, which are becoming exclusive Muslim areas. Similarly the 
	builders in previously mixed areas are refusing to sell the housing units to 
	minorities. In places like Gujarat the economic boycott of Muslim community 
	persists in substantial chunk of places. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One was aghast to know about the 
	conversation of two Hindu women, in Anand; Gujarat, when one said that she 
	lives in a good and clean locality the other one went on to say that she 
	lives probably in a better area as there are no Muslims at all in her area. 
	It is common place to hear such things like ‘Oh one is good despite being a 
	Muslim’, in Gujarat. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This Navaratri festival one was 
	pained to hear that in Indore, the local VHP has put a ban on the entry of 
	Muslim youth in the Garba dance festival, on the grounds that Muslim youth 
	will lure away Hindu girls, ‘our girls’. Those using religion on the 
	chessboard of politics are working overtime at a deep societal level to 
	create a wedge between the communities. At the same time the propaganda is 
	promoted to the effect that we the Hindus go even to the Sufi Dargahs but 
	the Muslims do not come to our temples. This has been a frequent question 
	fielded in the National integration workshops conducted by many of us. The 
	polarization along religious lines strengthens the communal forces; the 
	ghettoisation of minorities strengthens the fanatics of that community and 
	gives a free run to the Mullahs to dish out their fatwa’s on the community. 
	And the vicious circle begins. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The democratic nation state can only 
	be based on the values of Liberty Equality and Fraternity (community). The 
	national community is the basic pillar of the democracy. The country 
	fragmented on the lines of religion or caste can not stay together, cannot 
	progress. As such also most of the times the pluralism and diversity are a 
	matter of celebration till the vested political designs step in. India’s 
	rich syncretic traditions have seen the boundaries between religions as the 
	point of meeting of the people and not as the point of separation. The 
	interaction seeps into all aspects of social life, religion being one major 
	component of that. It is keeping this in mind that Dara Shikoh, who was a 
	scholar of Persian and Sanskrit, went on to write in his book Majma ul 
	Baharain that India is a great ocean, the meeting point of two seas, 
	Hinduism and Islam. The same is manifested in our religious traditions (Bhakti 
	and Sufi), in our food, dress, architecture, music, dance, literature and 
	what have you. This is what was envisaged by founding fathers of our nation 
	as the ground on which India was to stand. This was the base of our national 
	movement. This was in contrast to the ideas of communal stream, Muslim 
	League (Urdu, Muslim, Pakistan) and Hindu Mahasabha-RSS (Hindi, Hindu 
	Hindustan). The latter tendencies were rejected by the freedom movement, by 
	the people of India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With ascendance of Hindu right, the 
	exclusivist politics based on dominant culture is being asserted and brought 
	to the fore. The present trend of polarization, ghettoization is seriously 
	undermining the National integration. It will breed in to divisive trends in 
	sections of society. We need to choose as to in which direction we have to 
	go, direction of the efforts like that of Mahant Gyandas which can bring the 
	communities together or in the direction of VHP associates who under one or 
	the other pretext want to exercise the exclusionist politics. The Mahant, 
	rather than getting discouraged by the court ruling has decided to take out 
	Ram-Rahim yatra, which surely is the best way to continue his earlier 
	initiative at Hanuman Garhi. One can just compliment the efforts of Mahant 
	Gyandas, Babu bhai and their likes and hope that their tribe increases.</font></p>
