	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From 1987 Sangh (RSS) has activated 
	its offshoot Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram (VKA) into higher gear of activity. 
	Adivasis, the most neglected part of society are being wooed through newly 
	devised cultural mechanisms. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To begin with Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram 
	used the word Vanvasi, instead of the correct nomenclature, Adivasi. The 
	claim put forward by Hindutva is that these are parts of Hindu society who 
	went to jungles to escape the conversion by Muslim kings. Due to their long 
	stay in jungles they became untouchables and drifted away from the fold of 
	Hindu society. This assertion kills many birds in one stone. On one side it 
	tries to project that despite Aryans coming here from outside, Arctic zone, 
	are not foreigners like the Muslims and Christians. Then aggressiveness of 
	Muslim Kings is restated and the inner cruelty of Brahminical Hinduism is 
	hidden as Adivasi ‘problem’ is projected to be coming from outside. A 
	shifting of the ‘blame’ of inner ills to outside forces! Another aim 
	achieved through this formulation is to bring Adivasis to Hindu fold and 
	claim that its not a conversion but mere Ghar Vapasi, returning home, of 
	these wretched of the earth. At the same time for the political project of 
	intimidating the Christian missionaries working in the villages a ground is 
	prepared to attack them as foreigners. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The forays of Sangh in Adivasi areas 
	intensified from mid eighties when it was realized that by directly 
	attacking dalits, the way they were attacked in 1980 and 1986 in Gujarat 
	through caste violence, will be counterproductive at electoral level. The 
	strategy evolved was to ‘use’ them as foot soldiers against Muslim 
	minorities. At the same time electoral arithmetic brought to their attention 
	this substantial chunk of population of Adivasis trying to come up through 
	modern education and thereby disturbing the status quo, prevalent in the far 
	off villages. Its here that the Christian missionaries were perceived as a 
	big threat to the project of Sangh, which wants to maintain status quo vis a 
	vis Adivasis dalits and women. Through the network of schools spread in the 
	far off areas these Missionaries, whatever be their own motives, were 
	instrumental in getting a section of Adivasis empowered and in the process 
	the upper caste affluent base of Sangh was getting jittery. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The posting of RSS volunteers into 
	the forest work was very systematic. Apart from attacking the Christian 
	missionaries as foreigners the Ghar vapasi was brought in at a big scale in 
	all the Adiviasi areas scattered from Gujarat to MP to Orissa. Around this 
	time many a swamis, descended in these areas, Lakkhanand in Phulbani area, 
	Aseemanand in Dangs, Asaram disciples in Jhabau and many other such efforts 
	were unleashed. In Adivasi areas they resorted to intimidation, you are 
	Hindus, Hindu rituals are like this and so these have to part of your life. 
	Dilip Singh Judeo, of the ‘God is money’ fame, of Chattisgarhg, had the 
	record number of Adiviasis converted in to Hinduism by newly devised 
	baptizing techniques. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the same time Hanuman was 
	popularized as the God in this area and lately Shabri, the destitute women 
	who had the privilege of offering wild berries to Lord Ram is being 
	projected as the Goddess of Adivasis. The cultural symbolism cannot be 
	missed in the selection of these deities. Hanuman was the unquestioning 
	devotee of Lord Ram, with muscular power as the main virtue. He is capable 
	of flying while carrying a huge mountain. But all the more he is carrying 
	the mountain because he cannot identify the herb needed for treatment of 
	Laxman, Lord’s younger brother. This is what is the signal to Adivisis, 
	unquestioning loyalty to Lord Ram, no need to have education. So what are 
	the Christian missionaries doing here? Why should they be trying to educate 
	you? They are foreigners. So Pastor Stains is picked up for the treatment 
	which they want to meted out to the white robed priests and nuns. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shabri, the embodiment of poverty is 
	being glorified on purpose. Your great ancestress had the privilege to offer 
	wild berries to the Lord. She is your role model, poor, powerless and with 
	blind reverence and devotion for the upper caste. The recently held festival 
	in Subir, Dangs district of Gujarat, celebrated Shabri and lakhs of Advasis 
	were brought from neighboring Adivasi areas for the festival. The local 
	people were scared that Sangh’s festival may create the trouble and they may 
	try to forcibly do the conversions to Hinduism. It was declared that 
	Christians and Muslim are foreigners and are a threat to Hindu religion. 
	This Kumbh is meant to protect the Hindus from the foreigners. In the 
	beginning it was announced that conversions are the aim of Kumbh and than 
	silence was kept on this point once various groups questioned their motives. 
	This was boldly stated in the CD produced by Shabri Kumbh organizers. By the 
	time the court ruling came to ban this CD was given, lakhs of its copies 
	were already circulated and had the desired effect of threatening the 
	Christianity community. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Shabri samiti distributed 
	saffron flags to the villagers and spread the word that those who do not put 
	the flag will be regarded as anti Hindu, those who do not visit the Kumbh 
	will also be regarded as anti Hindu. In this intimidating atmosphere the 
	intervention of Human rights groups resulted in the Central government 
	sending its observers. Also the Adivasi leaders realized the game being 
	played by Sangh and mercifully a large section of native adivasis kept away 
	from the festival. But Sangh has succeeded in spreading the seeds of hate 
	and intimidation far and wide. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During Kumbh the inflammatory 
	speeches were delivered by different leaders of Sangh. It remains to be seen 
	as to what will be the long term impact of this festival. One thing is sure 
	that the whole Adivasi area at some level has been shaken by this festival 
	in which the major organizers were the city based traders, contractors and 
	other supporters of Sangh. The native Adivasi festivals and gods are being 
	undermined in various ways. Adivasis never used to have the temple or place 
	of prayer within the four walls, most of their Gods were in the open. The 
	festivals, dancing and feasting also were held in the open. With the new 
	influence things are changing. The rift between the ‘Hindu’ and ‘Christian’ 
	Adivasis is widening which surely will have adverse impact on the life in 
	the area. In pursuance of the same tactics, now summer festival and Anjani 
	mahotsav (festival) are being planned. Anjani, mother of Hanuman was never 
	the object of veneration. Now she will be occupying a place amongst the 
	deities. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the festival of Shabri (Feb 
	11-13) in Ghubadiya, a place near Subir, the graveyard was dug up, the 
	crosses on the graves were burnt. Not much notice of this has been taken in 
	the local media and administrative circles. The increasing influence of 
	Sangh and the religiosity is taking deeper turns. One understands that from 
	the villages young girls in the age groups of 14-15 are being picked up to 
	be trained as Sadhvis who can give recitation of Ramayana and other Hindu 
	scriptures. The whole emphasis is on the cultural manipulation and the basic 
	issues of Adivasis like land, education and health are being cleverly 
	sidetracked through this culturo-religious manipulation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One can see the social engineering 
	in practice. The positive experience is that it seems that intervention of 
	Human rights groups can partly change the direction of events in a healthy 
	direction. Just before the Kumbh, human rights teams had investigated and 
	put out a reort, which was taken note of by the authorities and local 
	leaders. This put the Gujarat Government and Hindutva forces on the 
	defensive. THeexpected turn out did not materialize and even the Ghar Vapasi 
	was muted. The scare amongst the minorities was a bit less and the event 
	passed off relatively peacefully as Hindutva forces had to be restrained. 
	Question is, are the human rights groups willing, do they want to bring the 
	real Adivasi issues on the social focus? Can we ask for social auditing of 
	the activities of the relgio-cultural groups working in these areas? Can we 
	halt the process of spreading hate against the minorities in these areas?</font></p>
