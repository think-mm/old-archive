	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not for the first time that 
    the followers of God-men rampaged when their Guru was asked questions or 
    doubts on the grounds of laws of the land. Brinda Karat, CPI (M) leader and 
    MP pointed out (Jan 04, 2006) that the medicines produced in Baba Ramdeo’s 
    factory in Haridwar contained animal and human parts. She stated this on the 
    basis of the version of the workers sacked from the factory. In response 
    hell was let loose and the supporters of Ramdeo attacked the office of CPI 
    (M) leading to the skirmish between the followers of CPI (M) and Ramdeo.
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ramdeo said that CPI (M) is not 
  nationalist, that it is a ploy of multinationals and that he is being defamed. 
  His strong support came from the Sangh Parivar followers, the hooligans of VHP 
  and Bajarang dal joined the attack on the office of CPM, while the BJP leaders 
  came out strongly to condemn CPI (M) for its insult of India’s culture. One of 
  them went to the extent of saying that whenever Indian (read Brahminic 
  Hinduism) culture is gaining prominence CPI (M) feels threatened. Many leaders 
  from other parties kept quiet or ‘supported’ Ramdeo. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The story, which has been undermined 
  in the din of hysteria, began with factory owned by Ramdeo where many a women 
  employees were exploited heavily and 133 women were sacked for demanding the 
  implementation of work norms in the factory. That’s how Brinda Karat, who 
  wanted to defend the rights of women employees, got to know about the factory 
  and got the samples analyzed. The issue was raised by her as a citizen and as 
  an MP. According the prevalent laws the Ayurvedic medicines cannot put any 
  human or animal extract in the medicines. The basic issue of workers right and 
  the ethics of production of Ayurvedic medicines both have been swamped by the 
  emotions roused because the owner of the factory has the halo of a God-man, 
  conducting shows of Yoga on TV. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The cover of Baba-dom is the best to 
  hide the things or to avoid following the laws relating to business and 
  industry. It is not too far back in the time that one Narendra Maharaj was not 
  allowed to violate the norms of security of air travel, as he was prevented 
  from carrying his dandam (Holy staff) along with him while traveling. The 
  whole hell was let loose; his followers were on the streets, rampage and the 
  usual venting of ire. It is touted that the God-men teach religious values of 
  tolerance, peace and non violence! Most of the occasions these followers go on 
  rampage when their Guru is not allowed to flout the laws with impunity, or an 
  uncomfortable question is raised about their activities. It is no different in 
  other religions. Once Asghar Ali Engineer, human rights activist of great 
  repute, questioned the delay in the flight due to late coming of Bohra High 
  Priest Syedna, this mild questioning was followed by the ransacking of his 
  house and office and he himself was beaten up mercilessly. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While nobody in the political circles 
  is picking up courage to raise the question regarding Ramdeo, can one presume 
  that those in the electoral politics believe that there are two sets of laws, 
  one for the ordinary mortals and another for the ‘divinely ordained’. The 
  association of saffron God-men with Hindu right is close and overt/subtle, 
  both at the same time. Recently Ramdeo attended the annual convention of 
  Rashtra Sevika Samiti a subordinate organistion of RSS (incidentally RSS does 
  not permit women to be its members). When Shankaracharya was arrested in the 
  Shankar Raman murder case, Vajpayee and Aasaram Bapu rubbed shoulders, to 
  protest against the arrest of the ‘holy seer’. The argument put forward was 
  that Shankaracharya represents Hindus and is revered by Hindus, so he should 
  be treated differently. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One has some general observations 
  about the God-men. During last several years they have been flourishing at 
  exponential rate. Most of them have done very well by the profane standards of 
  accumulation of wealth, chain of plush Ashrams, lakhs of devotees, infinite 
  money, foreign junkets and all the luxuries possible. You renounce the world 
  to get the best of it! Their prefixes also are very diverse and keep on 
  getting better and better with time. They do choose their prefixes and 
  suffixes. While other God men do it in their own way, Rajneesh had an 
  interesting trajectory of these. He began as Acharya, went on to become 
  Bhagwan (God!) and finally gave himself the title of Osho before he left this 
  planet. All of them have different strengths (! weaknesses), some one is more 
  for diamonds, someone likes cars and expensive clothes and yet another one 
  prefers videos of dubious distinction. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While many other politicians are 
  bowing to the popular pressure and defending Ramdeo, Sangh Parivar regards 
  them as the representatives of Hindu culture. What is Hindu about their 
  culture needs another investigation. One has seen the spartan life of Buddha, 
  Kabir, Nanak and Gandhi. Budhha in fact renounced his palace to take to jungle 
  and merge with all and sundry in their deprivations. The many from the current 
  genre, which in fact is a blot on the humane traditions of saints, are also 
  close to centers of power, Dhirendra Brahmachari, Satya Sai Baba, Chandraswami 
  and Jayendra Saraswati being some notorious examples. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ayurveda is being linked to Indian 
  Traditions. As such the development of the Ayurveda was halted, mainly by 
  Brahminical dictates. Ayurveda has lot of elements, which can be put on the 
  scientific foundations to make it more suitable to the human kind. The proper 
  research where critical reason is employed to make it better is not employed 
  in the Ayurveda as it is strongly linked to faith. No doubt multinationals may 
  have their own axe to grind in the whole story, but we need to look at the 
  proper investigation of facts and laws before the medicines produced by any 
  Baba, Acharya and Mahant, can be put to public use. Karat has just raised a 
  simple question, why is Ramdeo’s factory violating eh laws of the land? It is 
  a simple matter to investigate and set right. But since here the factory owner 
  has the hallow of God-man, radiating in the reflected glory of God almighty 
  how dare we the mortals raise such questions. The God-men are above the law is 
  the premise of their followers and supporters, whoever they be! So in a single 
  stroke Brinda Karat and her party are dubbed anti Hindu (Anti National, 
  against Hindu Nation) so how is nationalism defined? If you blindly submit to 
  the self proclaimed God-men, you are a nationalist else! Is one against the 
  indigenous system of practices? No way. The only demand is for ethical and 
  rational implementation of the therapies to avoid any one coming up and 
  putting in market medicines or methods which can be injurious to the health. 
  Social scrutiny of any thing and everything is called for. The cloak of 
  Holiness does not exempt one from the laws of the land and being subject to 
  the critical questioning of peers and others from raising questions about the 
  composition and techniques being put forward. The claims related to the 
  efficacy of the medicines and techniques have to be evaluated on the basis of 
  the criterion already developed by rational techniques. Subjecting traditional 
  systems to these rigorous methods will only make them more effective, 
  meaningful and will prune out the grain from the chaff. It will make them 
  above the subjective claims of those promoting it. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If Ramdeo has done no wrong, why this 
  emotional outburst and the misuse of label anti National against Karat? If he 
  has things to hide than this angry outburst is understandable, as it will harm 
  the proliferating business built up with such a meticulous mix of some 
  knowledge sprinkled with generous helping of emotions and faith which are 
  wonderful smokescreen for hiding one’s wrongs. This ‘faith’ can surely act as 
  an opium, the frenzied followers of Baba’s rampaging shows that time and over 
  again!</font></p>
