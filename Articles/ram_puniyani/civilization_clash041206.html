	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During last two decades World has 
	seen the rise of politics based on religious identity. Particularly after 
	the 9/11 2001 WTC disaster there is a widespread feeling that Samuel 
	Huntington’s thesis, that after the end of cold war the current time is the 
	one of Clash of Civilizations (Clash), is true. One has witnessed many a 
	controversies where religion has been dragged into the murky world of 
	politics. Osama bin Laden talked of Jihad and George Bush responded to the 
	WTC attack by uttering that it is going to be Crusade for him. He and his 
	associate Blair both gave divine reasons for attack on Iraq. Multitude of 
	controversies veered around Danish cartoons, Pope’s statement about Islam, 
	the banning of burqa in some Western countries, the rise of acts of terror 
	in the name of Islam with the epithet coming that all terrorists are 
	Muslims, has become popular in the social thinking at broad layers. 
	Superficially it is projected as if it is the clash between the Islamic 
	culture and the Western civilization. Here in India also attempts were made 
	and are underway to project Islam as a religion of violence and Muslims 
	being fanatics out to stick to the medieval social norms. The overall impact 
	of the events and acceptance of this Clash thesis by Huntington has worsened 
	the problem and is widening the intercommunity rifts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As such the term clash of 
	civilization was put forward by Bernard Lewis and later on converted into a 
	thesis by Samuel Huntington, whose essay in a journal, Foreign Affairs 1993, 
	became more popular after the 9/11 2001. At the end of cold war Francis 
	Fukuyama postulated ‘End of History’, which stood for &quot;What we may be 
	witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a 
	particular period of post-war history, but the end of history as such: that 
	is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the 
	universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human 
	government.&quot; (quoted from &quot;The End of History?&quot;, 1989) This was in response 
	to the philosophy of Karl Marx, whose Historical materialism propounded that 
	the struggle between the classes is the cause of progress of society, 
	leading to the classless society and end of History, i.e. beginning of 
	classless, commune based society, communism </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the backdrop of Fukoyama’s ‘End 
	of History’, Huntington postulated that while the age of ideology (Marxism, 
	classless society) has ended with the collapse of Soviet system, the World 
	has only reverted to the state of cultural conflicts. As per him the primary 
	axis of conflict will be along cultural religious lines. The principal 
	conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of 
	different civilizations. The clash of civilization will dominate global 
	politics and fault lines between civilizations are the battle lines of 
	future. As per him, “It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of 
	conflict in this new World will not be primarily ideological or primarily 
	economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of 
	conflict, will be that the cultural. Nation states will remain the most 
	powerful actors in world Affairs, but the principal conflicts of global 
	politics will occur between Nations and groups of different civilizations. 
	The clash of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines 
	between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many did approve of this thesis and 
	the accompanying classification, whose main criterion is religion. This 
	thesis did create an anxiety and confusion adding to the problems of the 
	nations all around. It is in this context that Kofi Annan, Secretary General 
	of UN launched an initiative co-sponsored by Prime Ministers of Spain and 
	Turkey for an Alliance of Civilization in August 2005. This initiative 
	nominated a high level group cutting across different religions and nations 
	to come up with an understanding of the world today and to recommend the 
	measures to restore the amity of civilizations, cultures and people of the 
	of the World. The report has been recently (Mid Nov2006) submitted to the 
	Secretary -General (http://www.unaoc.org/repository/report.htm)and it’s a 
	landmark in more ways than one. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It debunks the Clash thesis to bring 
	our attention to the alliance between different cultures, nations and people 
	at all the levels, social, political and economic. It is not only in current 
	times but since the times people started migrating and interacting that the 
	alliance has been the undercurrent of the societal life. The report points 
	out that Clash theory has distorted the terms of discourse on the real 
	nature of predicament the World is facing. The history of relations between 
	cultures is not only one of wars and confrontations; it is also based on 
	centuries of constructive exchanges, cross fertilizations and peaceful 
	co-existence. One is reminded here that India’s ex-president, Dr. 
	K.R.Narayanan, in response to the Clash thesis, said that Civilizations 
	don’t clash, it is barbarisms which clash. In Clash thesis, Cultures and 
	religions are identified with the religions of the kings and their wars are 
	presented as clash between religions or civilizations. The Hate ideology 
	spread by communal group’s right here in South Asia also bases itself on the 
	wars between Kings of different religions and these kings are presented as 
	symbols of that religion. The whole aspect of cultural interaction is 
	missing in this discourse. For example in India while the atrocities of 
	Aurangzeb are the core of building the Hate ideology, the confluence 
	articulated by Dara Shikoh as one can glean through his book Majma Ul 
	Bahrain, India being a confluence of different cultures, is missing in this 
	mindset. Similarly the rule of Muslim Kings in the subcontinent is taken as 
	the point for legitimization of Islamic nation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The worst part of this Clash thesis 
	is that by propagating that cultures are set on collision course, it helps 
	in turning the negotiable disputes into seemingly intractable, identity 
	based conflicts and this is what has taken control of popular imagination. 
	The report is based on the multipolar perspective and the UN Charter of 
	Human rights. Significantly it points out that there is no hierarchy amongst 
	cultures as each of them has contributed to the evolution of mankind. While 
	the core problem remains poverty and deprivation of vast sections of mankind 
	the rising trend of terrorism cannot be dealt with by seeing it as a mere 
	law and order problem or having its roots in religion. On the contrary 
	terrorism itself is a product of political circumstances, which need to be 
	solved on urgent basis. In societies if some groups are discriminated 
	against the violent repercussions come up and are perceived as libratory by 
	a section of people while the same is seen as anti national by the state and 
	other set of people. The durable solution to the causes of terrorism does 
	not lie in attacking some countries or increasing the role of armed 
	personnel in that area but in addressing the roots of resentment. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It traces the roots of current 
	violent responses in the partition of Palestine and formation of Israel, and 
	latter’s occupation of part of Palestine and other Arab territories, which 
	has come to be seen as a sort of colonialism by vast mass of people. While 
	Jerusalem remains Holy for Jews, Christians and Muslims, the support of 
	Western powers to Israel’s highhandedness is perceived as the collusion of 
	West with the expansionism of Israel. The committee is very clear on the 
	point that no cause can justify the killing of civilians, non combatants. It 
	does call for freedom of religions and takes a strong stand against 
	desecration of holy places, irrespective of the majority minority religions. 
	The report does recommend several measures in the arena of education, youth 
	programs, community actions aimed to promote alliance, peaking it with the 
	recommendation that a forum of alliance of civilization under the auspices 
	of UN should be established and this should be promoted at all the levels, 
	national, societal and what have you. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The humane spirit of the repot is 
	visible all through. However the point is, in current times when the very 
	authority of UN has been undermined by the powers that are arrogant, can we 
	look forward to the era of Alliance and Amity so that the real problems 
	gnawing the vast numbers of human kinds are properly addressed to, i.e. 
	march in the direction of better world, i.e. struggle for human rights. To 
	put it in another way, is it possible to think positively, to think that 
	‘Another World is possible’, a World where Human rights of all of us are 
	adhered to.</font></p>
