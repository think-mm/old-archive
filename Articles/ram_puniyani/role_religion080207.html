	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Current times are witnessing 
	violence of severe nature all around in which religion is projected one of 
	the reasons. It is also projected as a clash between people of two religions 
	and that people belonging to a particular religion are violent due to their 
	faith, also that some violence is a retaliatory violence to check the 
	activities of others who are out to convert the gullible people by luring 
	them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In India one has seen the 
	intensification of violence in the name of religion more so from last two 
	decades. After Babri demolition a wave of violence rocked the nation. In 
	1998, a Pastor working amongst leprosy patients was burnt alive along with 
	his two innocent sons. Anti Christian violence has been the marker of our 
	times. The burning of Sabramati express in Godhra followed by the massive 
	anti Muslim violence, the genocide, was another blot on the national life. 
	The 9/11 events, resulted in the death of close to three thousand people of 
	all religions. Along with this came the thesis that current time is the one 
	of clash of civilizations, the backward Islamic civilization is out to 
	destroy the advanced Western civilization. One can see the underlining 
	element of the attempt to relate the violence and religion in some form or 
	the other. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Along with this came the 
	misunderstanding about other religions. This misunderstanding has assumed 
	mammoth proportions today and it provides the base for the violence and the 
	policy of aggressions/acts of violence and terror. There is a clear need to 
	understand the difference between religion and politics, there is a need to 
	understand the rise of violence from these misconceptions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most of the religions came as a set 
	of moral vales to guide the people to cultivate the feelings of love for 
	mankind. There began a process of institutionalization of religions to 
	ensure that these values are sustained and percolated to the broad layers of 
	people. At the same time the emphasis on rituals began to be heavier while 
	the focus and emphasis on moral values took a back seat. There have been 
	numerous attempts to ensure that the basic unity between people of different 
	religions is sustained though the efforts of saints and others who preached 
	the values of humanism in right earnest. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today the vested interests have 
	launched the efforts to suppress the weaker section of society and weaker 
	nations for the sake of their material interests. As these attempts are 
	undertaken in the name of religion a feeling of alienation amongst people 
	overtakes the real spirit of religion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here at home those associated with 
	RSS and politics in the name of Hindutva have been spreading the hate 
	amongst different communities. The result is there for all to see. This hate 
	has been spread against Muslims and Christians both. Muslims have been 
	projected to be fanatics, aggressors, having more wives, converting through 
	sword and being more loyal to Pakistan. This has resulted in a broad social 
	common sense which sees Muslims as the ‘other’, their demonization, the 
	consequent violence at different places even on the smallest of pretexts, 
	the fear and insecurity leading to their ghettoisation. At global level the 
	US has been resorting to War against terror which is a ploy to attack the 
	areas in oil rich countries and to create a global Islamophobia. World wide 
	this hate against Muslims is on the rise. In India the problem is worst 
	confounded as the US goals worldwide and RSS goals at home match and worsen 
	the problem. In many a Muslim majority countries similar processes are going 
	on against the other religious minorities. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In India even the tiny minority of 
	Christians has been accused of conversions through allurement and fraud. As 
	a matter of fact the population of Christians is declining from last four 
	decades (1971-2.60%, 1981-2.44%, 1991-2.32% and 2001-2.30 %), despite that a 
	sustained scattered attacks on Christina missionaries is on the rise. 
	Similarly the myths against Muslim minorities have no truth but have 
	captured the minds of people, the destruction of holy places done by kings 
	in the past for the sake of power and wealth is being presented as the 
	insult of faith, the conversions in the past are being presented as due to 
	coercion, the demographic profile which is due to social factors is being 
	shown to be due to religion, the loyalty to other nations is a mere 
	propaganda meant to suit their political goals, and that all Muslims are 
	terrorists also does not hold any water as neither is terrorism due to 
	religion nor all terrorists belong to Muslims.(LTTE, ULFA, Khalistainis, 
	Irish Republican Army and so on) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The responsible people of different 
	faiths do realize that this is not in tune with the spirit of their 
	religion. They are watching helplessly this whole process of demonization of 
	certain religious communities and the social rifts being created due to 
	that. Faith in the values of humanism is paramount in the values of 
	religion. This current scenario is pushing back the aspirations of poor 
	people and so it is needed that the situation is overcome for the sake of 
	better world, for the sake of peace and amity. While the political forces 
	bent upon creating this mayhem are very powerful and almighty, have control 
	over resources of different types and on media, the people with genuine 
	faith in human values need to come forward to ensure that this dark phase of 
	human history is overcome in the spirit of dialogue. The need for inter 
	community relations and dialogue was never needed more than at present 
	times. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The isolation due to this political 
	process is not only creating emotional walls amongst different communities, 
	it is also resulting in the retardation of social development. The kernel of 
	present efforts for peace lies in the process of building bridges amongst 
	communities and that process can be started only by a genuine dialogue 
	amongst people of different faiths, by coming close to each other by 
	abolishing the artificial boundaries created by the politics of hate being 
	practiced by various forces, globally and locally. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These dialogues amongst different 
	religious communities are needed at all the levels, starting from the basti, 
	mohalla to the leadership of religions, scholars of religions, the activists 
	engaged in dispelling hate from the society, and those working for human 
	rights, all of them need to be involved in this process of dialogue. The 
	present impasse which is presenting religions as the separating points need 
	to be overcome and the understanding that religious differences and plural 
	ways of life are a strength not an obstacle to peace. The dialogue amongst 
	religions needs to be supplemented by the cooperation in the field of social 
	work to alleviate the pain and misery of the mankind, there is a need to 
	encourage and coordinate in the field of struggles for the human rights of 
	deprived sections of society. We aspire for peace and we remind ourselves 
	that the peace desired by us can not be achieved without justice for the 
	people. Justice is a mandatory prerequisite for peace. The spirit of service 
	to mankind has to prevail over the current assault on the basic human values 
	in the name of religion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We need to look into the recent high 
	level committee of UN which went on to counter the thesis of Clash of 
	civilizations put forward by the US professor Samuel Huntington. This thesis 
	forms the cover for US ambitions for its aggressions in West Asia. The UN 
	committee (http://www.unaoc.org/repository/report.htm)has put forward that 
	there is no clash between civilizations, as a matter of fact civilization 
	have an alliance for a better tomorrow. On the similar lines one will like 
	to say that there is no clash between the moral values of religions, it is 
	the alliance between these values that the human race can look forward to a 
	better future, a future which will eliminate poverty, hunger, disease and 
	misery from the world. It is this alliance which will ensure that the focus 
	of world policies has to be brought back to the issue of Human rights of 
	weaker sections of society. Nothing short of a genuine dialogue amongst 
	people of different faiths can overcome the obstacles created by the 
	political forces misusing the religious identity for their political goals.</font></p>
