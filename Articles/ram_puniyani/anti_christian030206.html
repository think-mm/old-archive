	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There has been a continuous rise in 
	the number of incidents of anti Christian violence since last one decade. 
	Currently this violence has become a regular feature in Madhya Pradesh and 
	other BJP ruling states in particular and in other parts of the country in 
	general. The first simmering of these incidents began from 1996, went on to 
	have a sustained presence all through. This violence has mainly been in the 
	remote places. Burning of small churches, Bibles, attack on congregations 
	and assembly of people around the Church have been some of these. The most 
	horrific of these was the burning alive of Pastor Graham Stewart Stains 
	along with his two sons, Timothy and Philip. The main pretext of this 
	violence is that the Christian missionaries are converting the gullible 
	Adivasis, who are called Vanvasis by them, and are projected as the Hindus 
	who had to flee to forests to avoid conversion by the invading Muslims 
	Kings. The ‘fear’ of conversion by now has become a pathological obsession.
    </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lets begin with the facts first. The 
	booklets brought out by RSS combine, operating in the name of Vishwa Hindu 
	Parishad, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and Bajrang Dal, pick up small pockets with 
	small percentage of Christians, and show as to how the Christian population 
	is rising by leaps and bounds. Dangs is a case in point. Here out of the 
	total population of nearly 1, 80, 000, close to 8000 are Christians. In 
	Gujarat as such the total population of Christians is less than 0.5%. The 
	overall national percentage of Christians is on the decline, (1971-2.60, 
	1981-2.44, 1991-2.34, and 2001-2.30). And this is what is supposed to be the 
	demographic danger for the RSS combine! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is it the conversion that Hindutva 
	politics is scared of or is there some deeper political and social agenda at 
	the back of the Anti Christian campaign which has been strengthened from 
	1996? Some observations are very pertinent. It is from 1987 that RSS 
	affiliates intensified their activities in the Adivasi areas. It is 1996 
	that the BJP led coalition first came to power at the center. The other 
	point is that the attacks are mainly in the remote places. In the cities 
	where major Christian institutions are located, such incidents are few and 
	far between. There seems to be no such fear that one’s children will be 
	converted by the time they pass out after few years in urban schools. Yet 
	another point is that by now this violence has consolidated Hindutva in 
	these regions and the states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, 
	Chattisgarh, the states where Adivasis have a significant presence; BJP has 
	been able to come to power. Another major state where Adivasis are in good 
	number, BJP ally Biju Janata Dal is the leading party. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The anti Christian violence is 
	slightly of a different variety than the anti Muslim violence. Initially 
	anti Muslim violence was mainly in cities; mainly in places where Muslim 
	artisans are traders were having a good deal of presence. Bhiwandi, 
	Malegaon, Meerut are some of the major ones’ in this category. Later this 
	did spread to places where communal forces gained strength due to 
	ideological indoctrination like Mumbai and Ahmadabad. The main pretext of 
	anti Muslim riot has been Muslims aggressiveness and their loyalty to 
	Pakistan, their being terrorists, their appeasement by the Government for 
	vote bank politics. While most of this is totally false, popular psyche was 
	flooded with this propaganda. Its percolation was smooth due to the lack of 
	effective counter awareness and spread of the truth about this disadvantaged 
	section of society. A distorted version of History was also selectively 
	projected to demonize the Muslims and the picture is complete with Osama bin 
	Laden’s alleged role in 9/11. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In case of Christians, no such 
	demonization is possible. As such Christianity is older than Islam, 
	Christian missionaries are in India from AD 52, and in most of the major 
	cities their institutions are older than a century or so. British were the 
	patrons of communal politics; British are identified with Christianity so it 
	becomes difficult for Hindutva propaganda machine to demonize Christians on 
	the basis of History. More so the historical method followed by Hindutva 
	communalists is based on the version propounded by British Historians in 
	pursuance of British policy of divide and rule so demonization of Christians 
	on this ground is difficult if not impossible. RSS propaganda making machine 
	resorts more to demonizing Christian missionary activities in today’s times. 
	The global links of Christian missions are restricted to the funds coming 
	from abroad, and mercifully the whole Christian community world over is not 
	linked up with the local missionary activity. One of the reasons of this is 
	that RSS ideology and politics is hands in glove with the imperialist, 
	colonialists, who happen to be Christians, so Christianity cannot be 
	demonized the way Muslims and Islam are. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To overcome this ‘handicap’ the total 
	focus is placed on the conversion into Christianity and Gobbesian propaganda 
	has been supplemented by the proactive cultural manipulation. The symbolism 
	is used to woo Adivasis. The fascination of being accepted by the upper 
	caste, the RSS followers gives a sense of false pride in a section of 
	Adivasis who surrender to the Hindutva symbols and takes up arms on its 
	behalf to finish off the ‘enemies of Hindu nation’ as witnessed in the role 
	Adivasis played in Gujarat carnage. Since this work is to be in the remote 
	places many a Sadhus, Aseemanand in Dangs, Lakkhanand in Orissa, have been 
	unleashed in these areas. The groundwork for communalization has been 
	prepared by the so called Achrayas, Babas and Bhagwans belonging to the 
	streams of Asaram, Morari, Pandurang Shastri and their tribe. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The violence against Muslim community 
	has come in huge bouts after the pretext of burning a train (Sabrmati) or a 
	family (Bane family) in Gujarat and Mumbai respectively. These ‘incidents’ 
	are than used to browbeat the whole community. In case of Christians, at 
	present, the violence is chronic, low intensity and sustained. While this 
	anti Christian violence is more in BJP ruled states or the ones’ where its 
	allies rule, other states are also not exempt. While the major anti Muslim 
	onslaught was built around Ram Temple, by the program to demolish Babri, the 
	antichristian campaign is being centered on building temples of the 
	forgotten Gods and Goddesses. The Shabri temple in Dangs is a case in point. 
	The overall result is by and large the similar one, to browbeat the 
	minorities into ghettoisation, intimidation and isolation. The anti-minority 
	violence results in polarization of communities resulting in the electoral 
	gains for BJP.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims and Christians, both these 
	minorities are on the chopping block of Hindutva politics. Christians do 
	have better advantage of modern education and better awareness of their 
	rights. But of course, that is no insurance against the violence against 
	them as being witnessed from last few years. The hatred for Christian 
	priests amongst the Adivasis is intense. Our team had visited Dangs to 
	investigate the Shabri Kumbh. While some of us were talking to the Adivasis 
	in one corner, the word spread that a team of Fathers has come from 
	Ahmadabad. One of the Adivasi volunteer blocked the road and said he will 
	not let us go till Aseemanand gives us permission, since we are Christian 
	fathers. Either he or we will survive the confrontation. Once Aseemanand’s 
	volunteers came and checked our antecedents, we were ‘permitted’ to go. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Identity is the central point of this 
	whole attempt of RSS. One thing uniform in the areas visited, in Gujarat and 
	Orissa is the stark poverty and the problem of land rights of Adivasis. But 
	what better way to ensure that they are fed the opium of religion so that 
	the supporters of RSS combine in these areas, the traders, contractors, and 
	land grabbers can have their cake and eat it too. By now the polarization in 
	the Adivasi areas is very intense and RSS has every reason celebrate as a 
	large chunk of Adivasis have started yielding to the threat of Gharvapasi, a 
	bath in hot spring or their feet being washed by VHP leaders, is picking up. 
	Also threats are subtly being dished out that if they don’t put the saffron 
	flags, or don’t take the holy dip or don’t eat the Prasad the consequences 
	will not be good. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The writer of these lines saw the 
	success of RSS agenda on the bodies of starving, naked, semiclad Adivis 
	children who have been taught to shout Jai Shri Ram! We need to think as to 
	how the worldly issues of Adivasis, land rights, bread, clothing, shelter 
	and education are brought in the center of social and political planning? </font>
