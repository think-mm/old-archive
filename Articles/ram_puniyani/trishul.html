	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a public function held in 
	Jabalpur, M.P. (Sept. 2005) five thousand trishuls were distributed under 
	the leadership Mr. Pravin Togadia of Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The function was 
	organized by Bajarang Dal, an affiliate of RSS. In the meeting a pledge was 
	administered, which stated that all will be done to bring in the Hindu 
	Rashtra. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The previous Congress government had 
	put a ban on trishul diksha and with the BJP Government coming to power the 
	ban has been lifted. Many a places Mr. Togadia’s entry has been banned so 
	far as his speeches heat up the atmosphere of communal hatred. Trishul 
	Diksha has been devised by VHP as a mechanism to use religious cultural 
	symbols for political mobilization of Hindutva. During the period of Rath 
	Yatra the use of stickers like ‘Garv se Kaho Hum Hindu hain’ and the one of 
	Lord Ram with an aggressive posture were used with effect not only to 
	mobilize Hindus but also to intimidate the minorities. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Hindu right has been cleverly 
	using the symbols and imageries to polarize the communities and one recalls 
	its culmination in the post rath yatra communal violence, demolition of 
	Babri Msajid and horrific riots in Mumbai, Surat and Bhopal. The use of 
	symbols with religious resemblance has been the strength of RSS progeny. 
	Just to recall few more in this direction, one has been the popularization 
	of Vinayaka idols and Ganapati festival in South, the other being Hanuman 
	and Shabri festivals in the Adivasi areas. Most of these act to give the 
	cultural channels especially to Dalits and adivasis to co-opt them into 
	Hindutva fold. The choice of Hanuman and Shabri for adivasis gives a very 
	precise message of their place in the Hindu fold. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is being said that Trishul is a 
	part of Hindu religious tradition. Interestingly one never heard of Trishul 
	Diksha earlier. It is a political innovation by VHP. Earlier Trishul has 
	been a symbol associated with Lord Shiva, it was not meant for use in social 
	gatherings. It was mostly used while traveling to pilgrimage sites and also 
	by the sadhus. Its role is not similar to that of Kripan, which is amongst 
	the five basic ingredients of Sikhism. The Trishul designed by VHP and used 
	for mass distribution is a disguised knife with sharp edges which have more 
	of destructive potential. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Madhya Pradesh has been having BJP 
	Government off and on. It also has a deep and powerful network of RSS 
	shakhas, Bajrang dal offices and Vanvasi Kalyan Ashrams, the latter spread 
	in the adivasi areas. It is here in Jhabua that attempt was made to give a 
	communal color to the rape and murder of a young girl by a miscreant in the 
	campus of a Christian school. It was in Jhabua region again that the 
	intimidation of Missionaries has been intense on various pretexts. The main 
	grudge has been the activities of missionaries in the remote places. In one 
	of the trips to Jhabau region, where the alleged conversions are going on, 
	the writer of these lines was made to realize the real motive behind the 
	attacks on Missionaries. One of the Principals of the missionary schools 
	told an interesting episode. His school is located in a township where, as 
	is usually the case, many RSS supporters also send their children for 
	studying, as a matter of choice. Same RSS supporters allege that the 
	missionaries are doing the conversion work through their schools in remote 
	area. The Principal told that one such parent of a child invited him for a 
	dinner. In the after dinner talk he appreciated the Principal’s work in 
	educating the children. But he also pointed out that the schools in cities 
	and town places are OK but why should the missionaries open the schools in 
	the remote places to educate those ‘animals’, meaning adivasis! The real 
	reason for opposing these activities happens to be to oppose this 
	empowerment of adivasis through education, which is not much to the liking 
	of the Hindutva forces. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The coming to power of BJP 
	Government in MP has opened the gates for intrusion of Hindutva in its full 
	aggressive mode. This Govt. first with Uma Bharati as the CM brought in Cows 
	and Sants in the physical vicinity of the rulers. Cow based economy was 
	envisaged as a panacea for the economic ills of the state. With Bharati's 
	Tiranga Yatra and her resignation, which came as a big respite for BJP, as 
	any way Bharati had become a good deal of embarrassment for the party. Later 
	Babulal Gaur stepped in. For various reasons, to win over the patron ship of 
	RSS, to keep his seat safe from Bharati, Gaur treaded the safe path of 
	handing over the policy making department to RSS, which now is determined to 
	convert MP into another laboratory of Hindutva, a la Gujarat. First the 
	Government went on to ensure that Vande Matram is brought in, in offices and 
	schools. The activities of Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram have been stepped up in 
	the Adivasi areas. With this tirshul diksha the intensity of the communal 
	polarization will go up tremendously. The issue is not just the insecurity 
	of minorities; the issue is of violation of the basic norms of democratic 
	society, law and order. The mass distribution of knives, disguised as 
	religious symbols, will step up the violent psychology and intensify the 
	polarization of communities. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is precisely here that prior to 
	election the Bhojashala-Maula Masjid issue was brought up for electoral 
	purposes. The anti Christian violence unleashed in Jhabua-Meghnangar region 
	had paid dividends and BJP got good deal of electoral advantage. While the 
	BJP government is ruling, the RSS affiliates have got a free hand to 
	intensify their Hindutva agenda. MP has traveled a far way during last year 
	and a half. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The intense violence in Gujarat was 
	preceded by a period of BJP rule in Gujarat where the VHP, Vanavasi Kalyan 
	Ashram had a free run. The issue of conversion and terrorism was manipulated 
	to doctor the social psychology, and the emotional distances between the 
	communities. The culmination of this into the violence and later 
	ghettoisation, this has become a ‘model’ pattern of Hindutva politics. What 
	begins as innocuous sounding phenomenon gradually takes the direction of 
	dividing communities along religious lines. It is conceded that BJP led NDA 
	government at the center did provided the cover to the local BJP government 
	in its communalization of society but even before the full fledged pogrom 
	was launched by Modi and company the religious divide in the state was 
	extreme. The communal violence played the role of driving the permanent 
	wedge in the same. Despite the claims to contrary the society in Gujarat is 
	getting vertically split with emotional ghettoisation preceding the physical 
	ghettoisation. The process in MP is going on in the similar lines and this 
	trishul diksha is yet another step in the ongoing process. Hope the central 
	government wakes up in time to put brakes on this divisive process being 
	permitted by Babulal Gaur Government.</font></p>
