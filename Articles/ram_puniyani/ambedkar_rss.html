  <img src="http://www.proxsa.org/inspiration/ambed.jpg" width="235" height="275"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When RSS Sarsanghchalak said that 
	Ambedkar supported RSS ideology (16th Oct. 2005), it was not for the first 
	time that a political movement was trying to fabricate lies to co-opt a 
	major thinker and political leader of totally opposite views, for its’ 
	selfish interests. Mr. Sudarshan was trying to buttress the RSS ideology of 
	opposition to reservations by saying that Ambedkar did not support 
	reservations as they are for political purposes. One recalls that 
	reservations were part of the protective affirmative clauses for the weaker 
	sections. The only point was that as per his scheme of things reservations 
	will be for ten years by which time the social disabilities would be 
	overcome and reservations will not be needed. Who could have foreseen that 
	the machinery already in place for implementation of the government policies 
	would partly sabotage the implementation of reservation policy in such a way 
	so that the desired goals would not be achieved? No society can be 
	democratic and strive to go in egalitarian direction unless the victims of 
	centuries old discrimination are given special protection and nobody 
	conceptualized it better than Dr. Ambedkar. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sudarshan’s assertion that Ambedkar 
	drafted a Western constitution under the pressure of Congress, insults Dr. 
	Ambedkar in a deeper way. He was not the one to buckle under pressure. He 
	had the values and ideas of his own, and the example of this was when he 
	resigned from the Cabinet because Hindu Code Bill drafted by him did not 
	pass through and also because he was side tracked in other matters of policy 
	and planning. It’s a comment which is derogatory to the thinker and leader 
	who did all possible to ensure that he stands for his values and ideas 
	rather than compromises for the sake of power and pelf. At the same time 
	Sudarshan seems to be promoting his own postulate that Indian constitution, 
	is based on Western values and should be replaced by the one based on Hindu 
	holy books. It is in that direction that BJP led NDA coalition appointed the 
	constitution review committee, which of course was a dismal failure, thanks 
	to the opposition of RSS formulation by most of the people of this country. 
	Ambedkar did not buckle under any body’s pressure while drafting the 
	constitution as he was committed to the democratic values of Liberty, 
	Equality and Fraternity (community), the one’s which have been enshrined in 
	this book. Also it was the constituent assembly, a reasonably accurate 
	representative body of Indian people, which guided the constitution and not 
	the Western influence. One can go on to say that the constitution itself was 
	one of the major contributions of Babasaheb. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sudarshan also asserts that Dr. 
	Ambedkar stuck to Hindu culture while embracing Buddhism. Nothing could be 
	farther from truth. By no stretch of imagination one can call all the 
	tendencies prevailing in India as Hindu. The dominant tradition, which 
	passes off as Hinduism is Brahmanism. Dr. Ambedkar called Hinduism as 
	Brahminic theology and went on to say that he was born a Hindu that was not 
	in his hands, but surely he will not die a Hindu. Buddhism is not a part of 
	Hindu culture. The central part of dominant Hinduism is caste system, while 
	Buddhism stands for social equality. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As per Ambedkar the clash between 
	Braminic Hinduism and Buddhism is the major part of Indian history. In his 
	understanding of Indian History he divides it into three parts. Part one 
	Revolution, i.e. coming in of Buddhism to oppose Brahmanic caste and gender 
	hierarchy. This is followed by counterrevolution, during which the 
	Brahmanism attacks Buddhism at ideological level through Shankaracharya and 
	at the social and political level by the onslaughts of kings like Pushmitra 
	Shunga and Shashak. It is due to this that Buddhism, became extinct from 
	India till Dr. Ambedkar brought it back. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He chose this religion, while 
	rejecting Hinduism, mainly because its values of Liberty, Equality and 
	Fraternity (Community). To present him as supporter of RSS and RSS ideology 
	is a clever deceit, a political move, to win over sections of Dalits to 
	RSS-Hindutva politics. </font></p>
