	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After going through the turmoil 
    created by Advani’s ‘Secular Jinnah’ statement, its controller, RSS decided 
    to get rid of him and finally appointed Rajnath Singh, a regional leader, as 
    the President of BJP. Rajnath Singh was not much known in the broader 
    circles and the views he held were practically not much known barring the 
    fact of his tenure as the UP chief minister, which had nothing much to write 
    home about. Now with his pronouncements coming one can understand why he has 
    been chosen as the President sidetracking others who are much more popular 
    in the political arena. Mr. Sing holds on to hard core Hindutva, which its 
    progenitor Lal Krishna Advani had to tone down in the light of BJP electoral 
    debacle and compulsions of electoral calculations. Singh in contrast holds 
    to those even now. In one of the functions recently he went on to give the 
    outline of his understanding about his political ideology. He reaffirmed his 
    belief in cultural nationalism, and said that, culture is the main driving 
    force of the nation, and that India is not a politico-territorial state but 
    geo-cultural state. He also compared India with Israel. While the belief in 
    cultural nationalism is not new, we have been hearing about it from last two 
    decades and more, his comparison of India with Israel was a new dimension to 
    the ideology held by Sangh. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In contrast to the values of India’s 
  freedom movement and the principles of Indian constitution, India as a secular 
  democracy, the Sangh combine projected that India is a Hindu Rashtra. It also 
  brought forward the notion of cultural nationalism, the earlier version of 
  which was Hindi, Hindu Hindustan. In contrast the Muslim communal version of, 
  Urdu-Muslim-Pakistan. These are both parallel but opposite concepts, mutually 
  boosting each other. Cultural nationalism was contrasted to the notion of 
  India as a nation state, as a geo political phenomenon, and carried the 
  saffron flag as a symbol and Ram Gita and Acharyas as the central rallying 
  cultural (religious) points. For this politics the religion became the sole 
  marker of culture. The rich concept of culture as the set of aspects of social 
  and political life got reduced to the values derived from the Brahminic 
  version of Hinduism. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religion, its particular elitist 
  version, as the central repository of culture is the hallmark of narrow 
  sectarian politics based either on race or religion. Hitler in his heydays did 
  usurp democracy from within by bringing forward the notions of cultural 
  superiority of Aryans. Interestingly he and Mussolini both brought forward the 
  concept of integral humanism for their political agenda. Just to recount these 
  twin markers of fascist poltics led their countries to the path of suicide. In 
  Germany the process of unleashing the agenda of cultural nationalism led to 
  the massacre of 120 lakh people, half of them being the Jews. It is not a mere 
  coincidence that he came for praise from the ideologue of Hindutva, M.S. 
  Golwalkar, “…to keep up the purity of the nation and its culture, Germany 
  shocked the world by her purging the country of the Semitic races, the Jews. 
  National pride at its highest has been manifested here. Germany has also shown 
  how well neigh impossible it is for races and cultures, having differences to 
  be assimilated into one united whole, a good lesson for us in India to learn 
  and profit by. (We or Our Nationhood Defined, p.27)”. It is no wonder that 
  Hitler found/finds a place of honor in the schools text book of BJP ruled 
  Gujarat. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Modern nation states have come in the 
  geopolitical zones, with the common pasts and divergent social groups mingling 
  with each other. Geo political regions are the base of nation states. Culture 
  has too many more aspects than one stream of a particular religion. Religion 
  does matter but only as one of the components of culture. Again the country 
  has many cultures, within the same political boundaries. In the democratic 
  polity these cultures supplement each other in providing the richness to the 
  life and ethos of the country. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Interestingly for the proponents of 
  cultural nationalism the problems related to the lives of people, related to 
  their existence hold a secondary place, if at all. Despite their using them 
  for electoral purposes here and there, the running thread of their politics is 
  around religious assertion, identity based politics, at the cost of economic 
  and social issues. In particular, the social reform and the concept of rights 
  of the marginalized, exploited, deprived sections are pushed to the backdrop 
  and the ones’ related to dress code for women, the respect for clergy and god 
  men, the promotion of religiosity and rituals comes to the fore. It is true 
  that at times earthly issues are also talked about, but in political sphere it 
  is the emphasis that matters. For the poltics based on cultural nationalism 
  the issues of bread, butter, housing, education, employment and health are non 
  issues. Be it Taliban, or Hitler, Sudarshan or- Rajnath Singh, the emphasis is 
  on the religious identity related matters. And in a way this is a conscious 
  ploy to undermine the needs of poorer sections of society, their rights and 
  their welfare. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During freedom movement the peddlers 
  of cultural nationalism, Hindu or Muslims, were not supported by the vast 
  sections of Indian people. They had a narrow base in the elite sections of 
  society which slightly broadened due to the communal propaganda over a period 
  of time. A tiny section of middle class intellectuals joined the 
  Landlord-Kings and produced the ideology of Hindutva and Islamism which drew 
  some more borderline segments of society and could mobilize some downtrodden. 
  Despite that, it remained marginal phenomenon but was potent enough to cause 
  the violence in the name religion. This politics with the ideology of cultural 
  nationalism (Muslim and Hindu both) played in the hands of British policy of 
  divide and rule resulting in partition of the country. In Pakistan, the 
  upholders of communal politics, the practitioners of this ‘cultural 
  nationalism’ were in power most of the time and their politics led to the 
  spilt, further partition of Pakistan into Pakistan and Bangla Desh. In Sri 
  Lanka similar politics played a crucial role in oppressing the Tamils leading 
  to the rise of LTTE. In India it has come up in stronger fashion from the 
  decade of 1980s resulting in the horrific violence against the minorities 
  geared around the Ram Temple issue. To reemphasize, the word used by Mr. 
  Singh, ‘integral humanism’, which incidentally is very popular in Sangh 
  combine, was also used by the fascist regimes of Germany and Italy to unleash 
  internal repression against minorities and to launch aggression against the 
  neighboring countries. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a way Mr. Singh is right when he 
  says that for Sangh combine, his concept of India is the one like that of 
  Israel. Israel came in to play a crucial role for the imperialist designs of 
  controlling the oil rich zone and has been operating on the principles of 
  Zionism, again a concept serving the elite Jews in today’s times. It was 
  presented as the Jewish homeland but it had support of just a small section of 
  Jews, the affluent ones’. Israel’s aggression against Palestinians runs 
  parallel to the internally repressive state. No wonder Mr. Singh sees it fit 
  to compare his notion of Hindu Rashtra, cultural nationalism, as an ideal to 
  be pursued. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Incidentally there are various 
  contradictory phenomena around the concept of nationalism doing rounds at the 
  same time. They are struggling against each other simultaneously. On one hand 
  we have the process of Globalization breaking the barriers between nations at 
  economic level, though it is highly loaded in favor of the rich nations. At 
  the same time in different states the sectarian concepts of nationalism are 
  coming up in a serious way. Even in U.S. the Nation is being identified as an 
  Anglo Protestant English speaking country. Samuel Huntington the one to give 
  ideological veneer to the US imperialist designs, has come out with a book, 
  ‘Who are we’? And quite like M.S. Golwalkar he too identifies elite section of 
  US as the defining axis of US, an Anglo Protestant English speaking nation. 
  The similarities between the sectarian ideologies cutting across different 
  nations is not just incidental. It articulates the ideology of affluent who 
  claim to own the country because of religion, caste or creed. One does not 
  know whether Huntington, the ideologue of “Clash of Civilizations”, ‘backward’ 
  Islam versus advanced West, has read Golwlalkar or not, but surely he will be 
  ‘delighted’ to see the similar wave length of the thought process. No wonder 
  Huntington happens to be favorite of the Hindu right! </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The boundaries of nations states 
  should be breaking and paving way for a borderless human society. The 
  sectarian but powerful sections, who strengthen each other, are seeing the 
  dangers of pluralism, boundary less world and so the narrow sectarian concepts 
  of Nationalism, appealing to the orthodox-upholders of status quo, are being 
  projected far and wide. It seems the progressive ideologies, the one's 
  standing for the interests of poor and deprived sections of World have to give 
  a deeper thought to enhance the rights of every living human being, to come 
  back to ideas and movements which can actualize the U.N. Charter of Human 
  Rights, to be able to march towards a more humane society, looking at all 
  human beings as equal irrespective of their religion, language, caste, gender 
  or creed. </font></p>
