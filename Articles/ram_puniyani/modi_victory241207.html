	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Surpassing many predictions, Modi 
	did very well in the recently held assembly elections, (Dec. 2007) bringing 
	his victory tally to the one close to post carnage elections of 2002. While 
	2002 elections were preceded by an unprecedented polarization of the 
	society, in the current one it appeared as if there are many a factors which 
	will go against Modi, the internal dissidents, the incumbency factor, the 
	efforts of secular groups and slightly better efforts by Congress. This gave 
	the impression that the results will be touch and go, but they turned out to 
	be similar to the previous one giving him a massive mandate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This makes many a things clear for 
	us. One, the polarization has seeped in very deep in the Gujarat society. 
	The observation is that after every communal-violence, the major player of 
	the violence, in this case, RSS affiliate, BJP, becomes stronger. In this 
	electiona also, as was the case in the last elections, BJPs performance has 
	been best where the carnage was maximum. In other parts of the country the 
	polarization is reaching towards the critical line from where the rupture in 
	fabric of society becomes irreversible. It seems that it has already become 
	so in Gujarat. Gujarat which began as a Hindu Rashtra laboratory seems to be 
	turning in to a factory of Hindu rashtra. One of the major success of RSS 
	combine has been that it has been able to propagate successfully that Hindu 
	Rashra is for the benefit of all the Hindus, there is a struggle between 
	Hindu and Muslim interests, RSS is on the side of Hindus, while others are 
	against the interests of Hindus. The real fact is that in the name of 
	Hinduism, RSS is merely playing with the identity of Hindus and enhancing an 
	agenda which is against the social transformation of caste and gender, which 
	is against the interests of majority of Hindus. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Further it has succeeded in 
	instilling the fear of Muslims in the majority community. The formula used 
	is that all terrorists are Muslims, baying for the blood of Hindus and RSS 
	combine is their only savior. The propaganda is that while so many terror 
	attacks are taking place all over the country, the Hindus in Gujarat are 
	safe due to Modi/BJP/RSS. The fact is in during NDA regime and also during 
	the rule of Modi major terror attacks have taken place including the attack 
	on parliament and Akshardham. This, so called attitude towards terrorists is 
	projected by RSS combine as Nationalism. Nationalism as such should mean 
	sticking to the values of freedom movement and Indian constitution. The 
	second illusion created is that of progress of Gujarat. As such Gujarat was 
	already amongst the leading developing states. Now it is being presented 
	that all this is due to Modi. Goebells is being beaten hollow in the 
	techniques of innovating the propaganda techniques. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sometimes what matters is not the 
	truth but as to what is propagated and made a part of social psyche. One 
	cannot but draw many analogies from Hitler who went on to create a fascist 
	state, and in due course do away with the democracy. This also led to the 
	disintegration of Germany and its terrible defeat the World War II, 
	rupturing the German national fabric. There also, one saw the charisma of 
	one person overshadowing the party. There also the polarization was brought 
	in and sustained by targeting one after the other community or social group. 
	In Gujarat one sees the targeting of Muslims followed by the Christians. 
	What will follow next will unfold shortly? The only difference between the 
	German and Gujarat analogy is that in Germany the nation came under the 
	impact of the fascist boots at a rapid pace in most of the parts of the 
	state, while here the trishuls are marching at different pace in different 
	states. In Gujarat the RSS agenda seems to have come close to the peak, 
	while in other states, the march is on and is in different stages of 
	intimidation of democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The journey of Hindutva fascism in 
	Gujarat began with the anti dalit riots of 1980-81, followed by anti OBC 
	riots of 1986. Both these crystallized the support base of Hindutva, the 
	upper caste, affluent sections. The NRI Gujaratis, the money order senders, 
	played no mean role in consolidating the native fascism. The alienated NRI 
	Gujaratis fed the local divisive politics with dollars and pounds, 
	aggravating the divisive politics. Conscious social engineering was deployed 
	to co-opt Adivasis and dalits into the Hindutva fold from late 1980s. For 
	co-opting Adiviais, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram campaigned against the miniscule 
	Christian missionaries and attacked the tiny Christian community. For 
	co-opting other deprived sections, including dalits, intense religiosity was 
	promoted, Pandurnag Shstri, Asaram Bapu and Morari Bapu etc. ploughed the 
	ground for BJP to reap the harvest. Section of urban people saw the benefits 
	of the type of intimidation brought in by RSS affiliate politics. While 
	Muslims and Christians were directly hit the major goal was to subdue the 
	dalts and Adivasis, to ensure that they remain where they are, that the 
	status quo is maintained. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With Ram temple movement, the 
	polarization along religious lines went on deepening. The state sponsored 
	genocide on the pretext of Godhra sealed the issue. The laboratory took 
	clear shape, all necessary instruments in place. The experiment began. 
	Carnage was conducted with RSS affiliates playing the coordinating role. No 
	rehabilitation for the carnage victims, no justice for those who suffered 
	violence and then their gradual marginalization from social sphere. The 
	relegating of Muslims minority as second class citizens has become an 
	established fact and a section of Muslims even started the campaign to 
	reconcile to their changed status. A large section of Muslims saw that the 
	only alternative for them is to be on the bent knees, to join in the victory 
	celebration of the murderer-in-chief of the genocide, which led to their 
	miseries. Yes life has to go on irrespective! Some sheep are beginning to 
	cultivate the illusion that wolf is their savior. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The indirect fall out of this was 
	the eventual ghettoization of the community in Gujarat and its fall out all 
	over the country was in the form of widening gulf between religious 
	communities. It set rolling the similar phenomenon all over the country. 
	While electorally BJP sounds weak at all India level, the seeds of communal 
	politics and polarization have been sown all over. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While comparing the BJP/RSS politics 
	with fascism in the decades of 1990 one was hard pressed to explain the 
	absence of a charismatic leader at the national level at that time. 
	Classically fascist movement has to have a charismatic leader at the helm. 
	While Advani was spearheading Hindutva agenda and Vajpayee was wearing the 
	liberal mask very cleverly, none of them had the requisite charisma to send 
	the crowd into frenzy to call for the extra judicial killing of a criminal. 
	Modi has filled the gap and that too very effectively. Not only he is 
	getting away with justifying the fake encounter, he is able to project it as 
	a sign of bravery and courage. With observations of Gujarat poll, with the 
	type of charisma, which Modi has cultivated, the analogy with Modi-Hitler, 
	Hindutva-Fascism is more or less complete. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">History does not repeat it self in 
	the same manner. In Germany Fascism rode all over Germany with uniform 
	speed, with speed which was blinding, and went on to target Jews to begin 
	with. RSS, the patriarch of all Hindu right wing organizations, began in 
	1925; it is from 1980s that is has been able to actualize its political 
	agenda in a serious way. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While Modi's victory will pave the 
	way for total abolition of liberal space in Gujarat, the party, BJP, has 
	already been overshadowed by one supreme leader. Those dissatisfied with him 
	are shown the door. The plight of minorities and weaker section is going to 
	be worse. A section of affluent middle class will shine while the majority 
	deprived sections' voices will be put under the carpet in the name of 
	Gauravi Gujarat, under the slogan of development. And of course development 
	will never reach them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At national level, the rising 
	communal forces will derive encouragement from this and in other states like 
	Karnataka; BJP will try with stronger assertion. The BJP ruled states will 
	strongly implement the Hindutva agenda i.e. emotive, anti minority and anti 
	poor policies in a more systematic way. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Modi's victory is a warning signal 
	of transition of sub critical fascism, transcending the critical line to 
	strangulate democratic values in an ideological form all over the country. 
	The disarray in the BJP will give way to strong optimism, to strive for 
	power at center. All this may take place sooner than later if the secular 
	movements do not wake up and broaden their reach. Even today those standing 
	for secular values are much more in number and strength than those who have 
	came under the spell of divisive forces, communal forces. The point is can 
	they come together to ensure that the country does go in the direction being 
	asserted by Modi/BJP/RSS type politics? Need that the vision of founding 
	fathers of India is brought back to the social and political arena, that 
	pluralism, justice and harmony is made the central focus of our movement.
