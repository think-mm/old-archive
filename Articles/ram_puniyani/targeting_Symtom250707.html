	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The terror attack in Glasgow (July 
	06, 07) has once again, brought to the fore the debate about the nature, the 
	problem of terrorism and how to deal with it. There are multiple responses 
	starting from Prime minister, Dr. Singh saying that we should not label 
	terrorists. Further adding that as a Sikh, he knows the pain of being 
	labeled. The section of liberal, progressive thinkers felt they can no 
	longer counter the immense pressure of associating terrorism with religion, 
	a particular religion, i.e. Islam. Right wingers reasserted that it is OK 
	that individual Muslims are put under scanner, and also that noose has to be 
	further tightened around the probable suspects from that community to 
	prevent acts of terror. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While there are multiple dimensions 
	of the debate, some of points arising from the debate need to be understood 
	in depth. First, let’s note that in the whole of this debate the historical 
	context is missing. Why is it that this phenomenon has become more painful 
	in last two decades? As to how do we see the difference in the nature of 
	expression, of these insane acts, the acts of terror, coming from the likes 
	of ULFA, LTTE currently and Khalistanis and Irish Republican Army in 
	yesteryears? Some observers point that it is only with Muslim terrorists 
	that they can draw something from their religion to legitimize violence, 
	while this is not the case with others. Is it true? Let’s recall that the 
	Khalistanis also resorted to religious identity in a very strong manner.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the debate is not put in the 
	historical context we don’t realize that when certain Muslims as part of 
	Palestinian resistance in the aftermath of their being thrown out from their 
	own land, resorted to terror, they did not invoke Islam Also the Kashmiri 
	terrorists never invoked Islamic identity till the decade of 1980, before 
	the Al Qaeda infiltrated into their ranks and used Islamic identity for 
	their political actions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As such not much attention is being 
	to the fact that the phenomenon of terrorism is just a symptom of a disease 
	lying deep in the belly of the contemporary global politics, the politics 
	aiming to control the oil wells at global level. This global political 
	agenda has the local associates in the form of politics, resorting to use of 
	Hindu religious identity, Hindutva, whose ascendance has transformed the 
	communal violence in to more systematic anti Muslim pogroms as witnessed in 
	Mumbai and Gujarat. The global actions of attacking the Iraq, Afghanistan 
	and then again Iraq, have resulted in the feeling of insecurity, persecution 
	and intimidation by large section of Muslims. The local pogroms have added 
	up to the process of some of Muslims falling victim to the traps of well 
	laid out terrorist outfits. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To trace bit of this trajectory, 
	with coming of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran, US encouraged Saudi Arabia and 
	its version of Wahabi Islam, which in a superficial way uses the concepts of 
	Jihad, Kafir and violence to achieve its political goals. It is a version of 
	Islam, followed by miniscule Muslim minority in the World, and this formed 
	the base of Madrassas set up to train Al Qaeda in Pakistan, duly sponsored 
	and than supported by US with its puppet Pakistani military regime in toe.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Mujahidin trained in these 
	Madrassas are being projected as the Muslims, the representatives of Islam. 
	The fact is not only are they small minority amongst the whole Muslim 
	community, they were deliberately promoted, and propped up to fight Russian 
	army which had invaded Afghanistan at that point of time. It is the same Lal 
	Masjid which Mian Musharaff lately realized is a den of terror, which was 
	the darling of military rulers of Pakistan till a while ago. It is this Al 
	Qaeda which after throwing out Russian armies from Afghanistan turned its 
	guns against its mentor in the White House, World Trade Center attack, now 
	against the military rulers of Pakistan. It also infiltrated Kashmir and 
	communalized the militancy, and the Kashmiriyat which was the base of the 
	alienated Kashmiri militancy, was replaced by Islam. As a matter of fact, 
	even Khalistani terrorism had a subtle encouragement from the powers that be 
	and it also invoked religion as the base of their actions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The points are also raised that the 
	nature of Islam is such that it can be used for terrorism. Most of the 
	religious tomes have been interpreted in multiple ways. The same books have 
	been used for promoting peace and the same ones’ have been misused for 
	spreading violence. It pertains not just to one particular Holy book. Whole 
	Mahabharata, the massive war between two set of cousins derives its 
	legitimacy from Gita, the holy book of Hindus. The same religion is used for 
	peace the way Gandhi did, and the same religion is invoked while undertaking 
	the pogroms, one’s which we have witnessed in Mumbai and Gujarat not very 
	long ago. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is also an argument that while 
	dalits have been oppressed they never retaliated by violence, while Muslim 
	in the face of violence resort to violence. Here the nature of two types of 
	attacks/oppressions is very different. The oppression of dalits was/is a 
	case where social norm was given the religious sanction by Brahminical texts 
	and dalits were made to internalize it themselves over a period of 
	centuries. This is more of a case of religious indoctrination associated 
	with the concept of reincarnation, paap-punyaa (sin-reward for noble act), a 
	long process, by no way comparable to the present attacks on section of 
	Muslim countries and communities which has got mixed up. Also the demise of 
	bipolar World has given rise to the identity politics and in current times 
	politics is wearing the garb of religion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is an intense discussion about 
	methods of preventing terrorism. By its very nature terror acts are 
	unpredictable. Preventing them is marginally possible at a very heavy price, 
	but due to the scattered nature of this phenomenon it is not realistic to 
	prevent it. You tighten one hole, the other will come up, and that’s what 
	has been the case so far. Can you keep over 1500 million people under 
	scanner? On one hand the Clash of Civilizations is made to be the ruling 
	ideology in the world politics, on the other insane variety of religious 
	traditions are consciously promoted for the goal of political agenda. In 
	such a scenario how does one address the issue? Surly no symptom of a 
	disease can be controlled unless the underlying disease is also addressed.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Globally what is being done to undo 
	the aggressions on Afghanistan, Iraq? What has happened to United Nations? 
	What has happened to the report of International Jury’s repots on US war 
	crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq? What justice has been meted out to the 
	victims of Mumbai riots, or Gujarat riots? Have we been able to create a 
	situation where Muslims in India can feel equal? Everywhere there is an 
	active propaganda that they are terrorists? The victims of Afghanistan and 
	Iraq, what ever their religion, will they not incite reaction amongst a 
	section of people, who will think of these insane methods of retaliation as 
	the path to avenge the wrongs done to ‘them’. There cannot be anything more 
	foolish than this but what does one do to the psychological processes 
	unleashed in the aftermath of aggressions and genocides? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It should be in the fitness of 
	things that global human community starts thinking of reversing the 
	processes unleashed during last two decades in particular. The attacks on 
	weak countries by mighty empires, the bypassing of United Nations, the 
	organized pogroms against minorities and all such massive violations of 
	human rights, that’s where the real disease is and that’s what needs to be 
	addressed. The dream of peaceful society, global and local, democratic 
	rights and values, projecting the humane aspects of religion and 
	strengthening the peace movement should mitigate the problem of terror in 
	the times to come. Else, demonization of a particular religion, further 
	alienating a religious community will only worsen their plight. A good 
	physician does not just think of symptoms, but focuses more on the 
	underlying disease in a holistic manner and treats the symptom accordingly!</font></p>
