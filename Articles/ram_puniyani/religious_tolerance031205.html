	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the ongoing debate on secularism, 
	one of the formulations being put forward is related to the relationship 
	between Hindu tolerance and secularism. India is secular because it is 
	Hindu. You can talk about secularism because majority of people are Hindus. 
	A point similar to this was made by Mr. Lal Krishna Advani recently 
	(Hindustan Times Lecture Series, Nov 2005) when he said that secularism 
	disappeared from many of our neighboring countries, while it continues to be 
	here in India. According to him the survival of secularism in India is due 
	to the Hindu ethos, its tolerant values. His hint towards Islamic Pakistan 
	and Bangla desh was too obvious; Islam and secularism don’t go together in 
	this hidden message. Current times are the one’s ideology of Samuel 
	Huntington’s “Clash of Civilization”, as per which it is the backward 
	Islamic civilization which is the threat to the Western values of democracy 
	and freedom. These sweeping generalizations are far from the truth and a 
	closer look at the state of politics all over the World and more so in South 
	Asia itself will tell a different tale. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the neighboring countries like 
	Pakistan and Bangladesh (Muslim majority), democracy has been an elusive 
	beloved, generally eloquent by its silence, present by its absence. The 
	reasons are to be looked at in the social processes of abolition of 
	feudalism rather than in Islam. There are many a Muslim majority countries 
	where democracy flourishes, Indonesia, Turkey being some of those examples. 
	Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country, has been in the grip of military 
	dictatorship, Sri Lanka another Buddhist majority country has been a 
	democracy to a good extent. Nepal, the Hindu Rashtra has not been able to 
	sustain democracy and the ruling dynasty there has seen the bloodiest feuds 
	for the sake of Royal power. Even in this microcosm of the World it is not 
	possible to link religion and democracy. World over different countries, 
	with diverse religious majorities have different systems of governance and 
	the reasons behind that are again historical and social one’s. The one’s 
	related to democratization, secularization (doing away with the hold of 
	clergy on the affairs of the state) land reforms and not to the prevalent 
	religion of that part of the World. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Hindu tolerance is glorified to 
	sow the seeds of intolerance and to attack secularism itself. The point made 
	is that, look Galileo and other scientists had to suffer at the hands of the 
	clergy when they went against the ideas propounded by the Church, but here 
	even people like Charvak, who opposed the dominant ideas held by Brahmins, 
	has been called Rishi (sage) Charvak. See this is the example of Hindu 
	tolerance. There is a good bit of distortion here. Even Charvak has been 
	deified much later in the typical Brahminical style, which goes on to co-opt 
	the people while rejecting their ideas. This is done by upholding the name 
	of the thinker and at the same time by burying his ideas. Currently that’s 
	what is being done by Hindutva to people like Gautam Buddha and Dr. Ambedkar. 
	Coming back to Charvak, Lokayat tradition, it was suppressed and wiped out 
	totally. Today we do not have access to the writings of this tradition, what 
	is inferred about it is from the writings of those who opposed it, who 
	criticized it and physically eliminated it. The ideas of that tradition have 
	been recovered from this criticism. Great tolerance! Lord Buddha also talked 
	of ethos, which opposed the caste system and the hierarchical notions of 
	society. Buddhism was wiped out by the Brahmanical counterrevolution, 
	Shashank and Pushyamitra Shung massacred monks and Buddhism was banished 
	from this country till Dr. Ambedkar, through his studies chose it as the 
	religion of his choice and himself converted in to it. Many a saints, who 
	came from low castes and were the vehicle of opposition to Brahminical 
	system were done to death, Tukaram may not be the sole one for whom the 
	plane came from to take him to heaven. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Ambedkar upheld the ideology of 
	democratic secularism and put it forward in several of his writings and 
	enshrined it in the Indian constitution. These ideas are being attacked 
	openly by saying that this constitution is based on Western values so should 
	be done away with. At the same time he is being called ‘A Great Hindu’ son. 
	Mahatma Gandhi, who took along most of the people for national movement, was 
	also done to death by a votary of Hindutva. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even in the West where great 
	intolerance was shown to the scientists by the clergy, the democratic 
	process came to be firmly established and these are amongst the places where 
	secularism has got rooted in a much firmer fashion. As such in the pre 
	industrial feudal societies the intolerance is imposed by the ruling clique 
	of landlord and clergy. Most of the traditions in the World, within most of 
	the religions can be broadly put in these two categories. The one related to 
	the ‘institution’ of religion, which goes hand in hand with the powers that 
	be and the second one of saints, who in turn are associated with the poor 
	and deprived masses, bound in the ideological chains imposed by religious 
	clergy and in the social and political chains imposed by the feudal powers, 
	system of kingdoms. All religions have tolerant and intolerant traditions. 
	To glorify one’s religion as tolerant and to compare them with other 
	religions intoreant one’s is a clever deceit to glorify ones’ own religion.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Democratization in its core is 
	constituted by doing away of the feudal lords, kings and their associates, 
	the clergy. It is also asserted that Hindus did not have a church like the 
	one in West. As such the clergy is there in all religions only its pattern 
	of organization is different. In Christianity it has come up as the most 
	well organized system, the Church. In Hinduism it is scattered, it is best 
	expressed in the Marathi word, shetji-bhatji (landlord-priest).Kings used to 
	have their Rajgurus (Royal Priest, teacher) In Islam as such there is no 
	place for a separate group of clerical elements, but Shahi Imams do come up. 
	In practice the matters are the same and a section of Mullahs and Maulavis 
	do play the same role as that played by any other clergy in other religions.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The pattern is not uniform. The 
	secularization, the reduction in the hold of clergy on social-political 
	affairs, runs parallel with the extent if democratic process. More the 
	democratization process, lesser is the influence; dominance of clergy. At 
	places clergy has also changed its social role depending on the social 
	situation. People like Swami Agnivesh; though in saffron robes are closer to 
	the deprived and destitute, addressing their problems. Ramakrishna Mission 
	was Swami Vivekananda’s contribution for a similar purpose. The whole trend 
	of liberation theology works in the same direction. A sincere implementation 
	of Zakat is aimed at the same. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The rooting of secularism in 
	countries is not due to any particular religion. It is there due to the 
	elimination/diminution of the powers of landlords/clergy. When it is claimed 
	that Hinduism is tolerant so we have secularism, it has nothing to do with 
	the truth. Secularism stands not only for equal citizenship rights of people 
	of all religions, it also stands for the abolition of caste/class and gender 
	hierarchy. None of the institutions of religion tolerate this equality of 
	caste, class and gender. These values of hierarchy, in the post colonial 
	phase have also assumed the form of politics in the name of religion, 
	fundamentalism of different hues. Most of the fundamentalist movements 
	emerging from different religions are opposed to the process of 
	transformation of caste and gender equations towards equality. Talking of 
	the things closer at home, India, one can see that Hindutva, the politics 
	based on Brahiminical tradition of Hinduism, is cleverer. It does oppose the 
	democracy and is trying to impose Hindu rashtra. It perpetuates intolerance, 
	while claiming to be tolerant. Mahtama Gandhi’s murder maybe half a century 
	ago, this act of intolerance was not a flash in the pan. Just a few years 
	ago Pastor Stains was done to death along with two innocent sons for the sin 
	of working amongst leprosy patients. The projection that our religion is in 
	danger is again a common denominator of all religion based politics. The 
	political goals of elite projected as the interests of that religion. So 
	Muslim League representing the interests of Muslim elite will call for Islam 
	in danger and so the call for violence. The empowerment of Adivasis through 
	education, by the Christian missionaries, is a threat to the interests of 
	Hindu elite so Hinduism in danger and so the burning of Pastor Stains. Proud 
	acts of tolerance! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India became secular through a 
	struggle for democracy. India became secular through the efforts for caste 
	and gender equality. It became secular through the efforts of those who 
	participated in the freedom movement irrespective of their religion. Those 
	opposed to democracy and the values of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity 
	stood by the side, Muslim League and Hindu Mahasabha; RSS, the embodiments 
	the politics based on the intolerant traditions of those religions. The 
	Hindu-ethos of saint tradition is tolerant and is the base of democracy like 
	their counterparts in other religions. The intolerant traditions of those 
	religions are represented by the politics which calls either for Hindu 
	Rashtra, Christian state or Islamic state. </font></p>
