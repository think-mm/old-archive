	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The violence in France has been 
	sparked off by the death of two youth. These young men were trying to avoid 
	being spotted by police as they did not have the proper identification 
	papers. Police was making a search in the aftermath murder of a white man. 
	The way the violence is spreading it seems as if the pent up frustration has 
	found an outlet. Nearly three hundred cities have been gripped by this 
	painful process. The immigrants, mostly Muslim are staying in the suburbs, 
	are the one’s who are more involved in the violence. Is it one more example 
	of Islamic terrorism? Does it reconfirm that wherever there are Muslims 
	there is violence? Gerard Larcher, the employment minister of France, 
	hinting at the involvement of Muslims, stated that (Nov 16, 2005) large 
	polygamous families sometimes led to anti-social behavior by youths who lack 
	father figure because of which the employers are reluctant to hire them. It 
	is also being said in the ruling circles that there is problem with 
	integration of immigrants and more importantly with their children. Also 
	their number is too big to be integrated in the society. Some of the 
	important public figures went on to abuse this section of French population 
	by calling them as scum, barbarians, gangrene and what not. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The section of population being 
	referred to is from the ex colonies of France, from different parts of 
	Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, Mali, Senegal and Algeria, the countries from 
	where a big section migrated to France in the decade of 50s and 60s. There 
	is also a substantial chunk of people who have come from Sudan, Ethiopia and 
	Somalia. They also include substantial section of Blacks. Most of these are 
	poor Muslims, who came to France in search of greener pastures. The 
	prevalent laws, norms and mores did not treat them on par as equal citizens 
	and they were discriminated against in jobs and other social facilities. 
	Their lot became that of a second class citizens and a ‘different France’ 
	came into being, which is not regarded as the ‘mainstream’. The rate of 
	unemployment amongst this section is three times higher than the national 
	average. Economically bypassed, socially ostracized and politically 
	sidetracked, these sections of society lapsed into ghettoes. The mentality, 
	which goes with deprivations, the conservatism of worst kind sets in, makes 
	it a fertile ground for the orthodox Ulema, underground criminals and even 
	the terrorist elements. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Interestingly the plan of 
	integration devised by French authorities laid out that, housing colonies 
	should have provided low rent housing to the extent of 20% of the units, so 
	that these immigrants can also stay in the main areas. Failing this, housing 
	colonies had to pay a fine. Most of the housing colonies preferred to pay 
	the fine rather than have these economically and socially deprived in their 
	vicinity. Identity becomes the main bulwark of the psychological makeup of 
	those forced to live in ghettoes. It is in this background that one has to 
	look back the at ‘desirable secular’ norms of uniforms in schools. 
	Authorities did not permit hijab and other Muslim identity symbols in 
	schools. It created yet another cause of giving the sense of humiliation.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such ghettoes become the hub of 
	underworld activities with high crime graph. Education takes the backseat 
	and religious identity takes the driving seat amongst such communities. The 
	whole process of social and economic deprivation triggered the process of 
	alienation. This was well reflected by one participant of the violence,
	</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“We hate France and France Hates 
		us, I don’t know who I am, and what I am. I do not have a house here; my 
		grand parents live in Algiers. France is humiliating us. We are like mad 
		dogs jumping to bite whosoever we see. If we don’t burn cars who will 
		listen to us. This is the only symbol of our unity with the deprived 
		masses. By doing this we are letting out our anger against the enemies.”
		</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This poverty through exclusion of 
	the particular sections of society has reached a critical limit bursting in 
	the form of the blind violence. One is sadly reminded of some of the 
	similarities with Indian Muslims, who being the inheritors of the legacy of 
	partition tragedy; victims of communal violence and social discrimination 
	have also been forced to live in ghettoes, ‘mini Pakistans’. Many a 
	similarities of the suburbs of Paris can be seen in the life of large 
	section of Muslim youth and Muslim community here as well. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At most of the times social 
	phenomenon appears to be obverse of what they are at the roots. The same 
	phenomenon can be seen in a different many ways. One, it is the deprived 
	sections indulging in the violence out of frustration; second, it is the 
	Muslims who are indulging in this. The latter is a more convenient view for 
	the ruling establishment. The point however is to look at the trajectory of 
	the events and the dilemmas of communities facing discrimination of one or 
	the other type. Even here the superficial observations lead one to think as 
	if polygamy and bigger families are the cause of the plight of Muslims. To 
	put it in the perspective it is because of discrimination, poverty of 
	exclusion, which in turn leads to the social backwardness, large families 
	etc. Tragedy is that such phenomenon is emerging world wide to give the bad 
	image to Muslims and Islam. It is from such superficial observation that the 
	likes of Samuel Huntington derive their thesis of ‘Clash of Civilization’. 
	The twin track demonization of Islam, through the training of Al Qaeda by 
	U.S. for its interests in the Middle East and the legacy of colonial 
	problems being reflected upon the Muslims of today in the form of 
	discrimination are contributing to this bad image. The truth is standing on 
	its head. Islam and Muslims are not the cause of these tragic events. These 
	tragic events are an outcome of the political processes, some coming from 
	present imperialist exploitation and some coming as the legacy of the 
	colonial rule of yester years.</font></p>
