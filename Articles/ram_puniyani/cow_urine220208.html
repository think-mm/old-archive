	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Recently the BJP ruled Uttarakhand 
	Government (Feb 2008) has announced that it will procure cow's urine, on the 
	pattern similar to the procurement of milk by dairies, refine it and sell it 
	to Ayurvedic pharmacies. Other BJP ruled Governments are also working on 
	similar lines. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Cow has been having a central place 
	in the political symbolism of RSS combine. The place of this symbolism may 
	be only next to Lord Ram. On these premises, so far cow has been projected 
	as mother. In its major campaign against minorities' right since 1950s, BJP 
	predecessor Bharatiya Jansangh, had undertaken a nationwide, *Desh Dharm ka 
	nata Hai Gau Hamari mata hai*(Cow is related to us through our religion and 
	nation as mother) and also *Janm Janm Ka Nata hai Gau hamari Mata hai* (Cow 
	is our mother in our every birth). Since Muslims, one does not know why 
	Christians were not targeted for it, are not prohibited from eating beef and 
	since many a butcher belong to Kasai (butchers) occupation, this fact has 
	been used to demonize the Muslim community. We worship cows, they eat, they 
	butcher cows! This has been used to rouse the sentiments of majority 
	community time and over again. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With Uma Bharati becoming the chief 
	minister of Madhya Pradesh (2005) for a brief while, she introduced cow 
	based economy, funds for Goshalas (cow sheds) were given from Government 
	treasury, and her official residence became the first such Goshala. Cow 
	based economy aimed at promoting cow products as the core of economy. The 
	present effort now transcends the earlier efforts as faith is being 
	transformed into blind faith. The Government's move to collect urine, to 
	procure it, refine it and sell it as a medicine defies all the logic of 
	science and medicine. It is converting the political symbolism into health 
	related prescription which is fraught with dangers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As such urine is a product excreted 
	through kidneys and contains the waste metabolites. It can also contain the 
	bacteria, bovine tuberculosis for example, and other harmful germs and 
	metabolic products. The biochemical studies of urine have clearly shown its 
	composition. There are some who claim magic healing powers of drinking one's 
	own urine, called Shivambhu, the most famous consumer of the same was 
	Morarji Desai. Some claim that it contains antibodies which act against the 
	harmful diseases affecting our body, but analytically and biochemical it has 
	not been proven so far. Physiologically kidneys do not let the antibodies 
	pass out of the body as the molecular weight of antibodies is much more than 
	the pore of the kidney membrane. Of course when kidney is damaged, these 
	antibodies can pass out, not when the cow is healthy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Murali Manohar Joshi, who as MHRD 
	minister initiated the introduction of faith based disciplines like 
	Astrology, Paurohuitya (Ritualism) also diverted some of the funds for doing 
	cow research. One CSIR lab went to the extent of obtaining a patent on a 
	pharmaceutical composition contating cow urine distillate and an antibiotic. 
	Another CSIR lab, in collaboration with a NGO undertook a study to see the 
	effectiveness of cow urine in cancer treatment. Our own ayurveda does not 
	mention any medicinal use of cow urine. Ayurveda as such has lot of valuable 
	empirical observations which can be deepened by rooting them on firmer 
	rational grounds but that is shrouded in mystery and faith and any 
	questioning of it meets angry protesters, who claim their faith is under 
	threat. Baba Ramdeo does claim that his 'Ramdeosim' is scientific but 
	forgets that the basic premise of science is peer review, facing the 
	questions and a constant transcendence of inadequacies in our knowledge 
	system. The faith based enterprise of Ramdeo is too individualistic, too 
	much dipped in faith and has too little to offer on rational grounds. Same 
	is the method of cow medicine, too much faith, and that too of blind 
	variety, too much assertion and zero scientific research. One will like to 
	explore the veterinary sciences to see if there is something drastically 
	right in cow's excreta in contrast to the excreta of bullock or buffalo or a 
	dog for that matter. Also one does recall the claims of the section that cow 
	dung has purifying effect. Impurity brought in by the shudras touching of 
	water was undone by mixing cow dung with the water touched by a dalit.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The basic difference between medical 
	sciences, empiricism, and grandma's medicine needs to be understood before 
	state Government investing and promoting cow excreta, urine, for human 
	consumption and application. Mercifully one has not heard so far of such 
	efforts to promote cow dung. The present effort by the BJP government is an 
	extension of RSS combine's cow politics. It is totally against the 
	understanding of modern medicinal sciences and also has no mention in the 
	traditional wisdom gained over a period of time. In a way it is the 
	translation of RSS combine's political understanding in to the arena of 
	application to human society. In some Islamic countries, on similar lines, 
	state sponsored research to undertake the study on djinns to solve the 
	energy problem. As per mythology djinns are supposed to be infinite source 
	of energy so why bother about oil and electricity when these blessed beings 
	can solve our problems for good. Surely these will also prevent the wars 
	which are taking place in the globe for controlling the energy reserves. And 
	not on a very different track, Christian right is asserting creation science 
	to oppose the theory of evolution. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These efforts have no rational and 
	scientific basis, something which our constitution ordains us to follow in 
	the public domain. Social auditing of efforts, which affect human health are 
	mandatory, control by bodies sanctioning the drugs and other medicinal means 
	are an absolute must for public safety, all the claims of politics 
	notwithstanding. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As such enough of politics has been 
	woven around cow. Just a few years ago, one of the eminent historians of 
	Ancient India, Prof. D.N. Jha, came out with a book on the dietary habits in 
	ancient India, which showed that beef was one of the major items consumed in 
	Ancient India. The move to project Cow as holy animal, mother, was a 
	response to the non violence propounded by Lord Gautam Buddha. With the rise 
	of agricultural society the cattle wealth was to be preserved. As people 
	started embracing Buddhism, the aggressive reaction of Brahmanism came up at 
	theological, social and political level. Cow was projected as the symbol of 
	rising Brahmanism, as a counter to the non-violence of Buddha, and has 
	remained so through centuries. Many a Mughal kings in deference to these 
	sentiments, to respect the feeling of the section of society, advised 
	against cow slaughter. Babar in his will writes to his son Humayun to avoid 
	the slaughter of cows. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Hindutva politics also there are 
	many streams. While Savarkar called cow as a useful animal, the other 
	sections ignited the emotions against Muslims around cow. Irrespective of 
	that many a poor Hindus and Adivasi did consume beef. Incidentally it is 
	amongst the cheapest source of protein for the poor. Many a surveys showed 
	that a vast number of Indian communities consume beef. RSS combine's 
	propaganda went on to assert that Muslims are violent and one of the reasons 
	is that they consume beef. This is so much against the pyschosoiological 
	understanding of the human mind and the violence. While one knows that beef 
	is a staple diet in major parts of the World, one also knows and modern 
	psychological theories demonstrate that violence does not emerge from diet 
	but from social and political situations. Beef can surely build muscle power 
	in conjunction with proper exercises, but violence is in the mind. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Undoubtedly one should respect those 
	regarding cow as their mother. RSS combines' many followers devote their 
	lives organizing fodder and other supports for Guashalas. Some of them, the 
	upholders of Cow as mother, non violence, go to the extent of justifying 
	violence against dalits on the ground that they were skinning a dead cow as 
	happened in the killings of dalits in Gohana. This cow urine in the pharmacy 
	shops defies all the logic and faith and is directly a threat to health of 
	people of the society. Faith can take such dangerous turns is to be seen to 
	be believed.</font></p>
