	<p align="justify">&nbsp;<font face="Verdana">Year 2005 turned out to be a 
    year of mixed fortunes for the right wing Hindutva politics. At surface it 
    seemed that it is crumbling but deep down its grip on societal affairs is 
    getting firmer at places. The electoral face of Hindutva politics, BJP, did 
    not seem to recover from its humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections 
    of 2004. In different moves and strategies adopted by BJP, its frustration 
    was writ large all through. The architect of Hindutva victory, Lal Krishna 
    Advani in a desperate action to project a brand new image for its party did 
    something unthinkable for Hindutva combine. In his trip to Pakistan, on the 
    mausoleum of Mohammad Ali Jinnah he quoted Jinnah’s speech in the Pakistan 
    assembly, where he exhorted the people to leave the communal past behind, to 
    regard religion as a private matter and to adopt the policy that people of 
    all religions will be equal in the eyes of law. As such it was a perfectly 
    correct quote and showed Jinnah’s thinking at that time. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The problem lay in the fact Jinnah had 
  been practicing communal politics for too long, leading the communal Muslim 
  League to play a divisive role in partitioning the country. The triad which 
  led to partition was British policy of divide and rule supplemented by 
  politics of the Hindu communalism, Hindu Mahasabha and RSS on one side and the 
  role of Muslim league on the other. Jinnah who began his career as a secular 
  politician, soon left the Congress as Congress was adopting the path of mass 
  movement, something alien to Jinnah’s elitist approach to the political 
  affairs of the country. The problem lay in the fact that after remaining 
  communal for so long you cannot suddenly wish away the communalists who 
  congregate around you. Also for RSS which had built its cadres on the “Hate 
  Jinnah, Hate Muslims”, it would have been a tactical disaster to look at this 
  aspect of Jinnah. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Advani was clear that the Hindutva has 
  paid rich dividends for increasing the electoral clout of BJP via the Babri 
  demolition and engineering of communal violence, but now it is impossible to 
  come to power again on the same plank. His efforts to change the ‘line’ of BJP 
  politics failed abysmally as RSS, the real controller of the BJP, disagreed 
  with this change and Advani has been forced to bid adieu to his long stint as 
  the strategist of the Hindutva politics in the electoral arena. One sidelight 
  of this was that some RSS swayamsevaks did project Jinnah as being good and 
  Gandhi being the villain, the person responsible for partition. Interestingly 
  some RSS sections have been cleverly using this argument to denigrate Gandhi 
  once again on the pretext of Jinnah controversy. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With Rajnath Singh taking over from 
  Advani, the signals are loud and clear of the supremacy of RSS line. RSS is 
  more concerned about continuing with its Hate Minorities tirade to keep 
  building its onslaught through the ground level work, through its different 
  children organizations. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This year also showed the holes in the 
  parliamentary credentials of BJP. On most of the issues related to the 
  problems of people, it shied away from the debate in parliament. Its only 
  method has been to stall the proceedings of parliament and to take delegations 
  to President as a substitute for its inability to be able to debate the 
  matters in Parliament, the forum of people. For those believing in Fascist 
  politics, Parliament and democracy is a mere means to achieve their goal of 
  authoritarian state over a period of time by eating through the foundations of 
  democracy either through force or through a take over of state apparatus.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Feb-March one video of the previous 
  Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee came to surface. In this Mr. Vajpayee is 
  ecstatic about the forthcoming events of 6th Dec.1992. His body language shows 
  assertion and glee, he says that did does not know, what will happen tomorrow 
  06-12-1992, and also that he has been told not to go to Ayodhya on that day. 
  In all probability the inference is that he was part of the cleverly planned 
  demolition where his role was reserved for the post demolition damage control. 
  With this probably the last mask the face of ‘liberal Vajpayee’ also fell to 
  pieces. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The nature of RSS has been a matter of 
  debate for many. It loves to project itself as the cultural organization. It 
  trains the young boys into the ideology of Hindutva, Hate minorities. This 
  year one research institute based in Virginia came out with its report, in 
  which RSS has been characterized as a terrorist organization and is clubbed 
  with the groups representing ‘new religious’ movements, like Al Qaeda. This 
  did create a good deal of ruckus but for reasons not told to the public it 
  kept quiet about this characterization of itself as a terrorist organization. 
  In a way the characterization is very appropriate as what the formations like 
  Al Qaeda achieve through bullets, RSS achieves similar goals through 
  ideological indoctrination of young minds. The logical trajectory of this is 
  again the same, violence at broad social scale at regularly occurring 
  intervals. The population of ‘others’ is rising, Hindus will be reduced to a 
  minority, India will become an Islamic state, (or a Christian state), has been 
  the core of RSS propaganda and indoctrination. In democracy as such it does 
  not matter as to what is the religion of the citizens. RSS probably does not 
  know this democratic norm. But for consolidating its politics it did misuse 
  the faulty demographics put out by the Census commission. In this prevailing 
  scenario the Census Commission’s faulty analysis that the rate of rise of 
  Hindu population has declined from 25.1% in the decades of 81 to 91 to 20.3% 
  during 91-2001 and the rate of Muslim growth has gone up from 34.5% during 
  81-91% to 36% during 91-2001, gave a good handle to RSS combine to beat the 
  minorities with. This ‘conclusion’ of Census commission came as the God’s gift 
  to the myth manufacturing machinery. Without wasting a minute various 
  functionaries of this RSS machine started pouring their venom out in the open. 
  Right next day a National newspaper came out with the analytic news that 
  Census commission has goofed and goofed badly. In the first ever report on 
  religions, it forgot that in the data put out in previous reports, data of 91 
  did not have Muslim majority Jammu and Kashmir in the data. So the comparison 
  and the supposed rate of rise sounded bigger. In real fact there is a decline 
  in the Muslim rate of growth to 29.3 i.e. a decline of 3.7%. The total 
  population of Muslims remains 13.4% while the Hindu population is 80.5%. At 
  the time of partition the Muslim population was 11.6%. Even in the current 
  data there are some holes. To begin with many an Adivasis have now got them 
  registered in the category, ‘other religions’, rather than the previous Hindu, 
  where they were placed automatically. This time Jains have also been put in a 
  separate category so this decline in the rate of ‘rise of Hindu population’. 
  The National Census commission did not highlight these intricacies of the data 
  analysis. It changes the interpretation in a very serious manner. Was it 
  deliberate? Shiv Sena branch of Dharampur in Bijnor, UP went on to declare 
  Jagrook (Aware person) award too few Hindu women who have more than five 
  children. To give a sanction to this agenda, the RSS supremo went on to advise 
  the Hindus to have at least 3 children and even to go up to 17 children to 
  stave off the “demographic threat” to the majority of Hindus. One is keenly 
  awaiting Mr. Sudarshan setting the precedent in this direction and junior 
  Sudarshans are very keenly awaited! It is also rumored that the vow of 
  celibacy which RSS Pracharaks have to take may be waived off in future so that 
  they can also contribute to the demographic cause of Hindus! With the sex 
  scandal tapes of these Pracharaks of RSS coming to the fore, it may be another 
  reason to lift this celibacy clause for Pracharkas of RSS. While releasing the 
  CD on the life of Laxmibai Kelkar, founder of RSS subordinate Rashtra Sevika 
  Samiti, Sudarshan did come out with the elaboration of RSS’s patriarchal 
  ideology. He stated that separate Rashtra Sevika Samiti was founded by Mrs. 
  Kelkar as Indian society does not approve of boys and girls working together. 
  He also said that this working together of boys and girls has adverse 
  consequences on the society! That is the reason that women in Hindutva fold 
  can be in Rashtra Sevika Samiti, Durga Vahini or BJP Mahila Morcha but not in 
  the hallowed precincts of the decision making RSS. Handling the Dalit issues 
  has been a major problem for Hindutva politics. While its ideologues like Arun 
  Shourie attack Ambedkar head on, its more deceitful ideologues have started 
  saying that Dr. Amedkar and RSS ideas were matching and that Dr. Ambedkar went 
  on to draft this ‘western constitution’ under the pressure of Congress. 
  Nothing can be farther from truth. But this is the constantly ongoing stream 
  in the manipulative politics of RSS, which for electoral and manipulative 
  reasons has started seeing the utility of distorting Ambedkar thought to suit 
  its political agenda. While at national electoral level Hindutva is in 
  shambles, its grass root work is deepening at the same time. The states where 
  BJP governments are ruling are gradually marching on the lines of Gujarat, 
  polarization of communities on religious lines is increasing, the state 
  sponsored activities are getting a deeper communal direction, the minority 
  ghettoisation is on the rise and acts of violence here and there are on the 
  upswing. The states where the local governments are sympathetic to BJP or are 
  its allies, the similar mechanisms are in progress, Orissa and other such 
  states are no exception. In some other states like Kerala RSS has consolidated 
  its ideological work and further consolidates the same through incidents like 
  the one which happened in Marad. The skeletons from the past continue to 
  rattle till the justice is done to riot victims. The tabling of Nanvati 
  commission report on Anti Sikh pogrom showed the same. The report does not 
  implicate the guilty in the way it should have and its recommendations area 
  also too mild to assuage the hurt of the Sikh community. The redeeming aspect 
  of this was that Prime Minister apologized for this pogrom in fair bit of 
  sincerity and some compensation is being expedited. Better late than never! 
  Gujarat by now is a “Hindu Rashtra in one state”. The aftermath of violence 
  has totally ghettoized the minorities, the polarization is to the extreme and 
  the feelings of biases against the Muslim and Christian minorities have peaked 
  to a great extent. The process of rehabilitation was totally ignored by the 
  state government and the relief measures were a private affair, at the mercy 
  of charity organizations. Legal remedy of the injustices has been a distant 
  dream. Zaheera Sheikh, who was paid 18 lakhs to turn hostile, was declared to 
  be the one lying on oath by a committee formed by Supreme Court. While this 
  case was slightly pursued, other such cases are lying unattended. It is 
  estimated that around 2000 such cases have not even been taken up at all. The 
  recently formed Nyay Pathiks are picking up the threads and are trying to 
  initiate the process of getting justice for those who suffered due to the loss 
  of their near and dear one’s, the physical humiliation and loss of property. 
  At the same time many a serious NGOs have initiated the steps for the 
  education and social welfare of the victims. The recovery of several skeletons 
  from the mass grave on the banks of Panam River in the thick of suburbs of 
  Lunawada (Pandharwada) shows the mirror to our society. The Police in order to 
  hush up the matter are claiming that all these bodies are accounted for, while 
  many of those who were declared as missing were buried here. The minority, 
  especially Muslims need an all round program not only to heal the wounds and 
  trauma of the Gujarat carnage but as such need to overcome the handicap of 
  discrimination in education and employment. At political level a large chunk 
  of Gujarat BJP had been opposed to the dictatorial methods of Narendra Modi. 
  Keshubhai Patel the previous Chief Minister called Modi’s rule as ‘mini 
  emergency’. Despite all this Modi continues to rule with the iron fist. His 
  opponents know the fate of Haren Pandya who deposed against him to the 
  citizen’s tribunal. In a polarized society of Gujarat Modi’s aggressive stance 
  has paid ‘rich dividends’ for his own self. In the scenario where fear has 
  been installed in the majority Hindus that Muslims are terrorists, it has been 
  successfully propagated that only a brusque person like Modi is the savior of 
  Hindu society. As such the social common sense in Gujarat is heavily dominated 
  by anti minority, (Muslim and Christian) sentiments and misunderstandings. 
  These myths have become deeper and more pernicious after the carnage. Some 
  social groups are making efforts to work against these but these efforts are 
  too little for the type of challenge which this state is facing at the moment. 
  The petty Muslim traders, richshaw drivers and the like are having a tough 
  time making a living due to the unwritten social boycott against them. The 
  continuing anti Christian violence is going at deeper social engineering of 
  Hinduising Adivasis. Shabri is being promoted as goddess amongst Adivasis and 
  Hanuman as the major deity. The same process is on in many a state where 
  Adivasis are in good number. In Gujarat massive Shabri Kumbh is been organized 
  in mid February 2006 to mobilize the Adivasis and to convert them into 
  Hinduism. Most of the development funds of Dangs are being diverted to provide 
  the infrastructure for this Kumbh, which is being organized by non Adivisasis. 
  RSS is putting full strength in this. It goes without saying that the 
  Christian minorities working and living in the far off areas are feeling very 
  insecure and also feeling intimidated due to this process, which carries a 
  subtle message against the Christian minorities on the pretext that conversion 
  activities are being done by the Christian missionaries. The sectarianism 
  cannot just be directed outside. The opposition to the Muslim boy Hindu girl 
  marriage had taken horrendous form when the Hindu girls were abducted from 
  their marital homes and the boys beaten up. Now a new outfit has been floated 
  by a VHP person, Babu Bajrangi, who is also the prime accused n the Naroda 
  patia carnage. Now, this Bajrangi has abducted 4 Patel girls who married non 
  Patels, the Maharashtrian Hindus. Sectarianism has its own logic; it just 
  cannot stop at Hindu-Muslim equation. The other states with BJP government 
  have devised different techniques to push forward the Hindutva agenda. In 
  Madhya Pradesh, while the political compulsions are resulting in the change of 
  Chief Ministers at regular intervals, the ground level communalization goes 
  unabated. Uma Bharati, the first Chief Minister one after the defeat of 
  Congress Govt. was heavily inclined to promoting cows. The CM's residence got 
  converted into a Goshala (Cow shed), with number of ‘saints’ giving company to 
  this holy animal. A cow based economy was conceived and efforts were made to 
  implement it. But meanwhile the Sadhvi Uma had to go. Trishul diksha which was 
  banned earlier has now become a regular affair with distribution of knives 
  disguised as Trishul being distributed at some price. This is accompanied by 
  intense communalization and feelings of hatred against the minorities. Keeping 
  in tune with the patriarchal notions of society, Maharani Laxmibai Girls 
  College, which was located in a Muslim majority area, has been shifted to 
  Hamidia College. This on the ground that during last few years over 400 odd 
  Hindu girls have been lured into marriage by Muslim youth. “Our” girls are 
  being taken over by “them”, the Muslims, has been the major ground for this 
  move, which will surely reduce the number of Muslim girls coming to the 
  college since it is being shifted to far off place and also many a departments 
  will have to be closed as Hamidia College does not have all the faculties. A 
  similar move was forced in Indore where Muslim youth were barred from 
  celebrating Navratri festival on the ground that they will be luring away ‘our 
  girls’. Indore also saw the state government totally supporting the hooligans 
  of VHP/Bajrang dal in breaking the security cordon at the Airport and 
  obstructing the take off of a flight. These hooligans were rampaging and 
  demanding the release of their coworkers who were arrested for rioting. The 
  intensification in the activities of Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram in the Jhabua area 
  has gone up since the Hindu Maha Sangam there couple of years ago. Trishul 
  Diksha has been spreading in different areas and it is reflective of the state 
  patronized communalization of society in the state. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rajasthan is another state where the 
  communalization process is very intense due to the BJP government’s direct 
  promotion of these activities. Apart from the frequent Trishul Dikshas, 
  communal violence in Banswada has been having a serious impact in the society. 
  Vasundhara Scindia has been encouraging the VHP, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram people 
  to go ahead with their agenda without any restrictions. The local MPs have 
  been pumping their funds for the spread of Sarswati Shishu Mandirs. A report 
  from Bhilwada indicated the rapid spread of Anti Muslim violence and attacks 
  on mosques. In Maandal a saffron flag was put on the mosque and a placard was 
  put with the slogan Jai Shri Ram. That the state complicity in these incidents 
  prevails goes without saying. Uttar Pradesh, the state where Ayodhya is 
  located has been the hotbed of communalism as such. With the declining fortune 
  of BJP the intensity of the problem is somewhat less. But here additionally 
  there are other things like Mulayam government being soft on Hindutva for 
  reasons which are overtly political. Here in Ayodhya Mahant Gyan Das has been 
  holding Roza Iftar in Hanuman Gadhi temple, the biggest one in Ayodhya. This 
  program which acted as the healing balm amongst the communities was well 
  appreciated by both the communities. This year the local VHP came in the way 
  of holding this function. It is a serious setback to the amity efforts in 
  Ayodhya. UP witnessed the riots in Mau. The riot was preceded and accompanied 
  by anti minority propaganda, the attack on their shops and religious places 
  apart from the attacks on their lives. The administration, despite the claims 
  of secularism and minority protection remained paralyzed on purpose, to let 
  the rioters complete their work of intimidating the Muslim minority. It also 
  showed the vulnerability of the Eastern UP, that the communal atmosphere is 
  prevalent here and that one may have to witness the repeat of the violence. 
  The matters are more complicated in places like Orissa for example. Here the 
  sustained work of VHP/VKA is sowing the seeds of hatred against the minorities 
  to a large extent. The real problems related to land, the Adivasi rights, have 
  been marginalized as in other Adivasi areas and the identity issues are 
  brought to the fore. Orissa was the state where Pastor Stains was burnt alive, 
  and that does reflect the reach of communal organizations, which persist and 
  are actively doing their work of communalizing the society. International 
  situation is adding on to the anti Muslim propaganda in a serious way. After 
  the invasion on Iraq, its occupation by U.S. armies continues. With lakhs of 
  U.S. soldiers still present on the Iraqi soil, the accompanying social and 
  political tensions continue to be serious. By now thousands of Iraqis and U.S. 
  soldiers have lost their lives. The incidents like the one of Abu Ghraib are 
  no exception and such events continue. Meanwhile George W. Bush dragged the 
  Lord almighty in its political project by stating that he decided to invade 
  Iraq on instructions from the Lord almighty himself. The regular resistance in 
  Iraq does come in the form of acts of violence against the U.S. occupation, 
  but due to the strong propaganda machine these acts are labeled as the terror 
  acts of Muslims. France witnessed the violence from the immigrant, alienated 
  Muslim youth living in the sub human conditions of Paris and other cities of 
  France. These are the youth who came to France to make some living. The 
  economic conditions have left no room for them to survive and their 
  frustration of theirs’ surfaced in the form of these despicable blind acts of 
  terrorism, but it was projected to be one more act of Islamic terrorist. At 
  home the United Progressive alliance prepared the Bill to control the communal 
  violence. The events of Gujarat have once again highlighted the fact that 
  state Government is accomplice to many of the tragic events. In Gujarat it was 
  on its display at its worst. The Bill submitted by the Government further put 
  more powers in the hands of state machinery. It is clear that the riots can be 
  controlled if the political will is there to do so. How that can be ensured is 
  a million life question which such bills can not answer. The basic mechanisms 
  need to put in place where the citizens are able to exercise their citizen’s 
  rights and demand for security and justice. The deeper malady of 
  communalization of social space and state apparatus needs to be looked. There 
  are some good measures which aim to declare a place as disturbed area, the 
  provision to shift the cases in a different state but lot more is needed to 
  modify this Bill before it can serve a suitable purpose. Many Human rights 
  groups are currently deliberating seriously to put forward suggestions which 
  can make the Bill close to what can be had under the present constraints. The 
  heartening bit of the adverse scenario has been the response of human rights 
  groups gearing up to face the challenge of communalism in a serious way. The 
  efforts to get justice for riot victims, to investigate the ongoing acts of 
  violence, to try to broaden the awareness about the threat to democracy have 
  some important tasks which many groups have taken up in all sincerity. And 
  that’s what gives hope for the future of democracy and secularism in the 
  society. The older ‘allies’ of BJP seem to be keeping a distance from it, but 
  one cannot trust these opportunistic formations, as to when they will sit in 
  the lap of BJP for political gains. BJP itself and its closest ally Shiv Sena 
  seem to be having severe leadership crisis. The very survival of Shiv Sena is 
  at stake. The BJP is embroiled in the revelation of various scandals, the cash 
  for question scandal, in which majority of MPs are those from BJP and that too 
  the one’s with RSS background. The video of RSS pracharak Sanjay Joshi may be 
  tip of the iceberg showing the deeper rot which is part of RSS system. The 
  popular image of BJP is taking a sharp nose dive. At the same time the deeper 
  communalization of society, the communalization of state apparatus and anti 
  minority sentiments is on the upswing. While RSS shakhas are drawing lesser 
  crowds, it work of cultural manipulation is going on stronger due to the seeds 
  planted in sections of print and visual media. Sangh organizations like 
  Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram are stronger in the Adivasi areas, discovering new Gods 
  like Hanuman and new goddess Shabri for the Adivasis. The Samajik Samrasta 
  Manch is trying to lure the Dalits into the trap of Hindutva politics. The 
  lakhs of Pracharaks and swaymsevaks of RSS are going on with their usual work 
  which has brought the communalism to the fore in India polity. </font></p>
