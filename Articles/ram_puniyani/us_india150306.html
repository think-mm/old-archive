	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When George W.Bush visited India, it 
	was a mixed reaction from this country. While the Government was laying 
	vacuum cleaned red carpet, its allies were protesting on the streets. A 
	section of progressive liberals was joining them and different shades of 
	Muslims protested under different banners. Most of media was jubilant, and 
	only a miniscule of commentators raised the question as to why after decades 
	of ignoring India why US administration is deciding to become pro India? One 
	recalls that India had to slog the hard way to build its industrial and 
	educational infrastructure without any help from the US. This biggest 
	democracy of ours was not in the right books of the US, so why this current 
	oozing of warmth from the mightiest of mighty nation? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The signing of the nuclear deal is 
	just a small part of the whole relationship. US is roping India into its 
	camp. Indian government, overwhelmed by the glamour and power of US might, 
	has a feeling that it is getting its due from the most powerful country. The 
	global equations are changing and this one marks the serious turn. So far 
	till the decades of 1980 US was battling and demonizing the USSR, which 
	happened to be the other mighty pole of World power. During the cold war era 
	US faced a stiff challenge to its agenda of World domination from USSR. US 
	did replace the declining colonial states like UK, France and Holland at 
	places. Its policies during this time mainly supported the dictators and 
	despots, it propped up the regimes which were dead opposed to democratic 
	values and went on to the extent of mauling the Vietnamese nationalism with 
	napalm bombs. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is another matter that Vietnam 
	turned the tide and US had to bite the dust in its hegemonic ambitions. US 
	is the only power in the World to have used the nuclear bomb so far. It had 
	unleashed a massive propaganda war against communism to back up its global 
	policy. It could smell a communist rat every where before it had to launch 
	its military cat to pounce on the independence of small and weak countries. 
	Examples abound, Iran 1953, Chile 1973 being two standing out and showing 
	the intent of US imperialism and its lust for global resources. Its policies 
	in due course led to rise of fundamentalism in various countries. In Iran 
	when it overturned Mossadeq and installed Raza Shah Pehlavi as the ruler, 
	whose policies in turn led to frustration and rebellion which got usurped by 
	Ayatollah Khomeini. Taliban was another outcome of US policies. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It propped up AL Qaeda to fight 
	against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. As per the Kissinger doctrine, 
	“Asians should fight Asians”. It did not want to repeat its mistake in 
	Vietnam and set up mechanisms to train the young Muslims as fighters under 
	the garb of Jihad. The support to Al Qaeda, Osama, its ally, was to the 
	extent of 8000 million dollars and 7000 tons of armaments including the 
	dreaded stringer missiles. With the defeat of USSR the subsequent events led 
	to the rise of Taliban. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">US intervention in the world, after 
	the collapse of USSR was much easier. It now floated the theory of ‘Clash of 
	Civilizations’, the battle between the advanced Western civilization and the 
	backward Islamic civilization. The intensity of propaganda and doctoring of 
	mass consciousness was intense and formed the base of US aggression against 
	Iraq (1991) Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). Now it is planning to occupy 
	Iran on one or the other pretext. The battle in the World is projected as 
	the clash of civilizations, religions to hide the basic aim of controlling 
	the oil resources and political hegemony. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islam is a threat to World is the 
	new slogan coined by US to occupy the oil rich zone, which also happens to 
	be Muslim. This slogan has replaced its earlier one of communism as the 
	threat to democracy and freedom, whose custodianship is supposed to be with 
	this friend-in-chief of most of the dictators. It has trampled UN, by 
	bypassing it to begin with and now by totally ignoring it in the new designs 
	as the World emperor. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The changing dynamics of development 
	is seeing that China is coming up strong and fast as a potential super 
	power. US will undertake every possible move to create and alliance which is 
	formidable and can take on the other superpower in case it comes in the way 
	of US designs on the political and economic control of the World. India by 
	now has come up with a substantial industrial and military prowess to act as 
	one of the junior partners of US in the new scenario. The new found love of 
	US for India is based on this practical calculation; it is based on its own 
	ambition to be bale to continue its domination on the World. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The section of Indian elite and 
	middle class is in total awe of this super bully. So from last one decade it 
	has been making all overtures to US to be accepted as its cohort. It offered 
	its bases during its aggression on Afghanistan and now has voted against 
	Iran on the nuclear issue. Not to see this long term interest of US to 
	checkmate China and to be overwhelmed by US gestures will be suicidal for 
	India’s interests in the medium and long term. The need is to strengthen the 
	global peace movement and to build a non aligned movement which can take on 
	the might of US, to strive for a global democracy amongst nations of the 
	World, by the revival and improvement in the norms of United Nations as a 
	potential World government, and also to bring back the aspiration of the 
	people of the World as enshrined in the United Nations Charter of Human 
	rights. </font></p>
