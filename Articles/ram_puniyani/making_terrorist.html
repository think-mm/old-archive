	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Defining terrorism and a terrorist 
	will remain as difficult as ever. The one non controversial part of the 
	definition will be killing of the innocents, to intimidate the political 
	powers and society at a particular point of time. Was killing of Indira 
	Gandhi by her body guards, who happened to be Sikhs, an act of terrorism? 
	She was involved in ordering the operation Blue star, the entry of army into 
	the holiest of holy Sikh shrines, the Golden temple. General Vaidya who was 
	Chief of army at that time was also assassinated, terrorism? When Rajiv 
	Gandhi was murdered by the ‘suicide bomb’, Dhanu, what type of act was that? 
	Rajiv Gandhi had sent the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), which the LTTE 
	regarded as a big obstacle to their politics. Did this tantamount to 
	terrorism? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bhagat Singh, the hero of millions, 
	the all time idol of the youths and revolutionaries, was part of the group 
	which killed Saunders. Bhagat Singh himself threw a bomb in Assembly, in 
	which no one was killed. He was labeled as terrorist by the British. While 
	on a lecture tour in Tamil Nadu one happened to give the example of LTTE as 
	the biggest terrorist organization in the World today to be confronted by 
	the section of audience, which felt that the LTTE is the organization for 
	freedom of Tamils in Sri Lanka. It is not too far back in the time that 
	Irish Republican Army decided to renounce the use of terror as a tactics to 
	gain its goal. Timothy McVeigh, the bomber who dropped a bomb in Oklahoma to 
	kill over 300 innocent people is still fresh in many a memories. While these 
	acts have there own place in the history of terror, the acts of terrorism to 
	stick to one’s mind are the ones by ‘Muslim’, terrorist groups, here and 
	there, all around. Last decade or so has been witness to many an acts of 
	insanity which have been indulged by Muslim individuals and Muslim groups.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The trajectory came to stark focus 
	with the 9/11 attack on World Trade Center, the London rail bombing, and of 
	course the scattered acts going on in Kashmir off and on. The recent act of 
	terror (October 2005) in Delhi sounded another tragic one in the same 
	series, adding on the stereotype that ‘All terrorists are Muslims’. Needless 
	to say that after each such act the search against all and sundry Muslims 
	goes up. Their demonization, that the Muslims are violent beings following a 
	religion, which teaches violence, Jihad is ongoing process. And they are the 
	one’s out to harass the innocent citizen’s of the World, becomes stronger by 
	the day. The Delhi attack has been the tragedy of a serious order. So many 
	innocents being maimed and butchered. The loss of innocent lives and 
	demonization of Islam and Muslims keep running in parallel. Some times one 
	feels that with these terrorists claiming to be Muslims and indulging in 
	such acts, Muslims do not need any other enemies. These elements are doing 
	their ‘best’ possible to get the whole community stereotyped in an adverse 
	way. Nobody can do a better job in demonizing Islam than the acts of these 
	insane elements. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why somebody takes up such an insane 
	path? Is it the teaching of religion, the parents of these terrorists, or 
	are there some other mechanisms which create these terrorists. There are 
	multiple routes by which one takes up the path of terror, killing of the 
	innocents. When anti Muslim pogrom was stalking the streets in Mumbai, one 
	did meet many a reasonable sounding Muslim youth who expressed their 
	explicit desire to take to the path of revenge through retaliatory violence. 
	After Gujarat anti Muslim pogrom, many a social scientists prophesied that 
	this pogrom will surely give rise to terrorists. In a vast community surely 
	there are going to be more than the critical mass of Muslims to take 
	recourse to ‘revenge’ through insane methods, terrorism being one amongst 
	them. This is the anger, hurt and the feeling that guilty will not be 
	punished which later gets channelized through conduits which dish out 
	terror. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Kashmir violence has belonged to 
	another genre of violence. It was the breach of agreement about the autonomy 
	of Kashmir, under the pressure from communal elements, that Government of 
	India started tightening the noose around the autonomy clauses inbuilt in 
	the treaty of accession. Nehru did advocate for winning over the hearts of 
	Kashmiris rather than the political means to reduce the autonomy. The arrest 
	of Sheikh Abdullah, when he complained against breach of treaty clauses 
	related to autonomy, and putting him to jail was the triggering point of 
	dissatisfaction amongst the Kashmiri youth which in due course led to the 
	thorny path of terrorism, of course duly assisted by the designs of 
	Pakistan. Just to recapitulate, it was Sheikh Abdullah who was instrumental 
	in getting Kashmir acceded to India and it was same Sheikh Abdullah who was 
	called a traitor by many who mattered including the Right wingers. The 
	dissatisfaction of Kashmiris in watching their elected Prime Minister (yes 
	he was Prime Minister of Kashmir) might have snapped many a links which help 
	in keeping the cool and sanity. These disgruntled elements were soon to be 
	joined helped by the trouble making designs of Pakistani Rulers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is just a bit later that US 
	started its agenda to fight the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan by the well 
	trained Al Qaeda outfit. The money and arms for this dreaded outfit were 
	routed through Pakistan, and the training to cultivate ‘Jehadis’, a 
	concocted misnomer for terrorists, was also outsourced to Pakistan. An 
	interpretation of Islam was manufactured to project that killing of 
	communists is Jihad as communists don’t believe in Allah. Islamic teachings 
	were mauled by the trainers to project that killing of innocents is also 
	part of the game in Jihad. As such, Islam, meaning submission to the will of 
	god, does not permit killing of the innocents. But the well designed 
	training schools of Pakistan and middle east which were playing in the hands 
	of U.S.’s CIA did not bother as to what the teachings of Koran, Islam mean. 
	Violence was dished out in the name of Islam and allurement of Jannat 
	(Heaven) shown to the young recruits in the path of Islam. This was the 
	group consciously trained to unleash terror, the bait being Islam and the 
	reward of going to Jannat. Many a Muslim youth were recruited and trained by 
	Maulanas in ‘Islam as violence’ and by CIA-ISI combine in to use of weapons 
	and other tactics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By this time the World started going 
	in the path of identity politics, the era of progressive radicalism, humane 
	struggles for rights of people started being replace by religion in the name 
	of politics. Religious identity became the core of politics and terror here 
	there and everywhere became the major phenomenon. This replaced the 
	struggles for Human rights of the decades of sixties and seventies, the 
	decades of progressive values. US President after President kept resorting 
	to the promotion of terrorism in the Middle East. George Bush the current 
	World emperor is most blatant in expressing the US designs and in this 
	direction he seems to have direct communication with the almighty God 
	himself. His communication system has reached right up to the Lord almighty, 
	who is designing the calendar of invading one after the other country. One 
	was not much surprised to hear his claim that it was on the instructions 
	from the God himself that he invaded Iraq, and now of course God is 
	preparing to give him the order to invade Iran and Syria in due course!
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One shudders to think of the times 
	to come. The global phenomenon to give boost to the US designs for 
	controlling the middle-east oil resources is overtly visible. Once the 
	identity of terrorism with Islam got established, courtesy the CIA run 
	training camps in Pakistan, now the job is comparatively easy for the World 
	emperor. Any where, the dispute can take the shape of terror; the politics 
	has already put on the veneer of religious identity. The real issues of the 
	World related to environment, poverty, hunger, disease and misery can be 
	shelved to the margins with ease and ‘social common sense’ can take resort 
	to the understanding that it is due to Muslims that the present sorrows and 
	miseries are happening. As Atal Bihari Vajpayee said, wherever there are 
	Muslims, there are problems. Where do we go from here? How can we ensure 
	that some youth do not take the path of terror? The underlying causes, at 
	multiple layers, need to be addressed if we want a terror free World-India.</font></p>
