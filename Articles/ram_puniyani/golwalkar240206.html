	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Beginning today, twenty Fourth 
	February 2006, RSS combine is going to undertake programs in different parts 
	of the country to celebrate the centenary year of RSS second Sarsnghchalak 
	(supreme dictator), Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, known in Sangh circles as 
	Shri Guruji. At a time when the communal common sense is seeping strongly, 
	propagating his ideology will definitely be detrimental to the democratic 
	values of the country. Golwalkar penned a small book, ‘We or our Nationhood 
	Defined’ (We…), which gives an outline of his ideology. Later his articles 
	were published as a compilation, ‘Bunch of Thoughts’. In both these books 
	and also in various other outpourings of his, he denigrates democracy and 
	pluralism on one hand and upholds fascist concept of nationhood and 
	sectarian version of culture on the other. His writing is most intimidating 
	to the minorities in particular. He was the chief of RSS for 33 long years 
	and was instrumental in giving RSS a direction, which assumed menacing 
	proportions in times to come, and strengthening the foundations of the ‘hate 
	minorities’ ideology resulting in the consequent waves of violence, 
	undermining the democratic norms in the society. He can also be ‘credited’ 
	in giving the sharp formulations which laid the ideological foundation of 
	different carnages in the country. Undoubtedly he had parallels from Muslim 
	communalism, embodied the people like Maulana Maududi etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Golwalkar praises Lord Manu as the 
	greatest law giver mankind ever had. It was the same law giver Manu’s book, 
	which was burnt by Dr. Ambedkar in his pursuit of getting justice for the 
	dalits. In current times, Golwalkars' successor also demanded a throwing 
	away of Indian constitution, to be replaced by the one which is based on 
	Hindu holy books, implying Manusmriti, off course. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His formulations of Hindutva Fascism 
	are so blatant that even his followers, the RSS combine, is running for 
	cover and claiming that this book, having a naked hatred for minorities and 
	eulogies of the likes of Hitler, We…, was not written by him. They avoid 
	owning these ideas. But one knows that this book was penned by him. In an 
	affidavit submitted to the charity commissioner, Rajendra Singh, a later 
	Sarsanghchalak pleaded, “With a view to give a scientific base to propagate 
	the idea-India being historically from time immemorial a Hindu nation-the 
	late Shri M.S. Golwalkar had written a book entitled ‘We or Our Nationhood 
	defined’, which was published in 1938.” (Quoted in Islam, Undoing India: The 
	RSS way) J.A. Curran in his classic study, RSS: Militant Hinduism in India 
	Politics- A study of RSS: points out “The genuine ideology of Sangh is based 
	upon principles formulated by its founder, Dr. Hedgewar. These principles 
	have been consolidated and amplified by the present leader (i.e. Golwalkar) 
	in a small book called “We or our nationhood defined”. It is a basic primer 
	in the indoctrination of Sangh volunteers… (Curran 1979, p.39). Since its 
	quotations have been brought to the notice of people, RSS publishing houses 
	have stopped republishing this book. What does Golwalkar say in this book?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this book he rejects the notions 
	of Indian nationhood, India as a Nation in the making. He rejects the idea 
	that all the citizens will be equal. He goes on to harp the notions of 
	nationhood borrowed from Hitler’s Nazi movement. He rejects that India is a 
	secular nation and posits that it is a Hindu Rashtra. He rejects the 
	territorial-political concept of nationhood and puts forward the concept of 
	cultural nationalism, which was the foundation of Nazi ideology. His 
	admiration of Hitler’s ideology and politics is the running thread of the 
	book and he takes inspiration from the massive holocaust which decimated 
	millions of people in Germany. He uses this as a shield to propagate his 
	political ideology. It is this ideology which formed the base of communal 
	common sense amongst a section of the population. “German national pride has 
	now become the topic of the day. To keep up purity of the nation and its 
	culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of the Semitic 
	races, the Jews. National pride at its highest has been manifested here. 
	Germany has also shown how well-nigh impossible it is for races and cultures 
	having differences going to the root, to be assimilated into a united whole, 
	a good lesson for us in Hindustan to learn and profit by.” (We…, 1938, p.37)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the Sangh circles this book is 
	regarded as their Gita. The implications for Indian minorities are presented 
	here in a forthright manner. Today the swayamsevaks brought up on this Gita, 
	do believe in all this but the language of expression is being made more 
	polished so that the poison is coated with honey and administered with ease. 
	Golwalkar goes on to assert, “From the standpoint sanctioned by the 
	experience of shrewd nations, the non-Hindu people in Hindustan must either 
	adopt the Hindu culture and language, must learn to respect and revere Hindu 
	religion, must entertain no idea but the glorification of Hindu nation i.e. 
	they must not only give up their attitude of intolerance and ingratitude 
	towards this land and its age long traditions, but must also cultivate the 
	positive attitude of love and devotion instead; in one word, they must cease 
	to be foreigners or may stay in the country wholly subordinated to the Hindu 
	nation, claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, for less any preferential 
	treatment, not even the citizen’s rights.” (Ibid p.52). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the Hindutva politics came up 
	in the late 1980s, in the beginning an unsuspecting observer could not 
	comprehend from where has the concept of Hindu nation come up suddenly, why 
	such an intense hatred for minorities, a glance at We… and one becomes clear 
	that those fed on this ideology cannot but be what they are, cannot do 
	anything else than what they did and have been doing since 1990, the Babri 
	demolition, the anti minority violence and an open violation of democratic 
	ethos of the country. These ideas were translated into the stories of 
	atrocities of Muslim kings, the myth of Hindus owning this land from times 
	immemorial and a lot of such make believe concoction. Irrespective of the 
	fact the freedom movement rejected this ideology and its formulations, it 
	was kept alive through the ideological indoctrination work in the RSS 
	shakhas going on ceaselessly. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Golwalkar was also faced with some 
	of the naïve swaymasevaks wishing to participate in the national movement, 
	more so after the massive Quit India movement was launched. That time 
	Golwalkar was the RSS chief and he dissuaded the people from participating 
	in the movement, and some of them who participated did it in their personal 
	capacity, some of them now claim that they also participated. (e.g. Atal 
	Bihari Vajpayee, who was onlooker in the anti British movement, was arrested 
	but wriggled out of the jail and later claimed to have participated in the 
	movement.) As matter of fact Golwalkar was very contemptuous towards the 
	anti British movement. There is no mention of presence of RSS in the anti 
	British movement even in most of the sympathetic accounts written about it. 
	Even Nanaji Deshmukh, the foremost leaders of RSS puts this question, why 
	did RSS not take part in the liberation struggle as an organization? 
	(Deshmukh, Victim of Slander, Vision Books, 1979, p.70) Since Golwalkar 
	propounded religion based nationalism, there was no place for anti British 
	stance. “The theories of territorial nationalism and of common danger, which 
	formed the basis of our concept of nation, had deprived us of the positive 
	and inspiring content of our real Hindu Nationhood and made many of the 
	‘freedom movements’ virtually anti-British movements. Anti Britishism was 
	equated with patriotism and nationalism. This reactionary view has had 
	disastrous effects upon the entire course of freedom movement…” (Bunch of 
	thoughts, 1996, p.138). In a frank defense of British colonialist he reminds 
	the people of RSS pledge, “We should remember that in our pledge we have 
	talked of freedom of the country through defending religion and culture. 
	There is no mention of departure of British in that.” (Shri Guruji Samgra 
	Darshan, Vol 4, p. 2) With allies like this British could merrily pursue 
	their policy of divide and rule! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No wonder British never repressed 
	RSS. Also the collusion between Religion based nationalism and colonialism 
	can be understood from such statements. Later the World saw that in tune 
	with this pro imperialist ideology, Golwalkar was to support the US 
	aggression on Vietnam and his successor Sudarshan defended the US aggression 
	against Iraq. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The murder of Father of the Nation 
	Mahatma Gandhi by a Hindutva follower Nathuram Godse not only shocked the 
	whole nation; it led RSS followers to celebrate this event by distributing 
	sweets. While RSS followers were celebrating, and the links of Godse with 
	RSS became apparent, RSS was banned and Golwalkar was arrested. They denied 
	that RSS had any links with Godse. At that time it was easy to claim so as 
	RSS had no written constitution and membership lists, enrollment register 
	etc. Godse was RSS Pracharak and later he joined Hindu Mahasabha and was 
	editing a newspaper, Agrani (leader), the subtitle of the paper was Hindu 
	Rashtra. In the court he denied any links with RSS. Later his brother Gopal 
	Godse, who was also an accomplice in the murder, in an interview given to 
	Times of India (25 Jan 98) stated that his brother Nathuram spoke a 
	deliberate lie in the court, “The appeasement policy followed by him 
	(Gandhi) and imposed on all Congress governments’ encouraged the Muslim 
	separatist tendencies that eventually created Pakistan…Technically and 
	theoretically he (Nathuram) was a member (of RSS), but he stopped workings 
	for it later. His statement in the court that he had left the RSS was to 
	protect the RSS workers who would be imprisoned following the murder. On the 
	understanding that they (RSS workers) would benefit from his dissociating 
	himself from the RSS, he gladly did it.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the wake of the murder of Gandhi, 
	RSS was banned and Golwalkar was jailed, from where he wrote a letter to the 
	Government of India offering to cooperate with the government in ‘dealing 
	with the menace of Communism’ in return for being released from the jail. 
	Incidentally it was also the period when US was on the witch hunt of 
	communists world over. Today, the global US agenda of demonization of Islam, 
	and Muslims world over matches with the RSS agenda, coincidence again? Is 
	this running parallel in the matching agenda US and RSS policies a mere 
	coincidence? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For him the notion of Hindu Rashtra 
	remained supreme and he could never reconcile to the secular values of 
	Indian constitution. Time and over again he kept on harping on how UnBharat 
	the constitution is and how Manu’s rules are more desirable and profound 
	one’s. The partition of India and the consequent tragedy was registered 
	through the Hindutva eyes, “Even to this day there are many who say, ‘now 
	there is no Muslim problem at all. All those riotous elements who supported 
	Pakistan have gone away once for all. The remaining Muslims are devoted to 
	our country. After all they have no other place to go and they are all bound 
	to remain loyal…It would be suicidal to delude ourselves into believing that 
	they have turned patriot overnight after the creation of Pakistan. On the 
	contrary, Muslim menace has increased a hundredfold by the creation of 
	Pakistan, which has become a springboard for all their future aggressive 
	designs on our country.” (Bunch of Thoughts, Bangalore, 1996, p. 177-78)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The way to look at Indian 
	communities as Hindus and Muslims as uniform monoliths continues to be 
	exhibited all through. Further he also goes on to label Muslims, Christians 
	and Communists as internal threats to Hindu nation. And this is the 
	‘ideological fodder ‘ of RSS shakhas and its practical unfoldment is visible 
	in the regular occurrence of attacks against Muslims and Christians. With 
	collapse of Soviet Union, the venom against communists has been given a 
	different turn. And in the third category secularist have also been added up 
	as a threat to Hindu nation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was Golwalkar again under whose 
	stewardship the RSS gave birth to other organizations to play the divisive 
	role in different arenas of social and political life. He was instrumental 
	in helping bring up Bharatiya Jansangh, Akhil Bhartiya Vidayarthi Parishad, 
	Bharatiya Majdoor Sangh, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, 
	amongst others. The infiltration of RSS cadres in different wings of state 
	apparatus; army, police, bureaucracy, judiciary, education and media was 
	another move initiated by Golwalkar, the effects of which are visible 
	prominently from last two decades. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While secular democratic elements, 
	activists have a long road ahead, we need to take care that in the already 
	vitiated atmosphere, the communal divide is not accentuated further by this 
	move of RSS and we put forward the values of humane plural and democratic 
	society and dispel the ideologies which have been playing a very divisive 
	role in the society. </font></p>
