	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The leadership of Congress has 
	apologized for the affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in the case 
	pertaining to the Sethusmaudram project. This project which was set off by 
	BJP led NDA regime, aims to make a canal from Palk straights to gulf of 
	Munnar. It involved dredging of Adams Bridge, also called as Ramar Setu. The 
	affidavit mentioned that the said bridge is not a man made structure and 
	also the Ram is a mythological not historical figure. This affidavit set the 
	emotive political streams rolling their political chariots, and hue and cry 
	that this statement of the Government is an act of blasphemy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Different agitations were already 
	planned at an RSS meet to oppose Sethusamudram project. Dharam Sansad 
	(religious Parliament, a VHP initiative) has been mobilized around 'faith', 
	on the ground that this project will destroy Ramar Sethu, the one which was 
	built by Vanar Sena (Army of Monkeys) to help Ram cross over to Lanka to 
	rescue Sita. The project was supported by most of the political parties in 
	the past, and cleared in particular by BJP led NDA, which is at the 
	forefront of making a political capital out of the issue now. The case of 
	worst abuse of faith for political agenda is on display! This project when 
	complete, will cut short the long journey of the ships from east coast to 
	the west coast, and vice versa. Like Panama Canal it has been conceived to 
	promote the transport, employment and trade. Half way now, it has been 
	facing two oppositions. The one is from the environmentalists, who are 
	worried about the destruction of flora and fauna and the dangers of silting 
	in the canal. These are the arguments which need to be taken seriously.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The other ground, the one based on 
	faith need to be dealt with at another ground. RSS and its affiliates are 
	promoting a view that building this Sethusamudram will involve be 
	destruction of Ramar Sethu which will be detrimental to our faith. The story 
	goes that Ravan; the King of Lanka had abducted Sita to avenge the insult 
	meted out to his sister Shurpnakha, whose proposal for marrying her was 
	turned down by the Lord Ram. Assisted by his loyal devotee Hanuman, the Lord 
	mobilized monkeys and built this bridge. It is claimed that this bridge is a 
	marvel of engineering achievements of the Indian engineers of that time. The 
	assertion is that it shows the acme of technological achievements of this 
	land, and that there are other noteworthy achievements like the advances in 
	aeronautical technologies like aero planes, missiles to name the few. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How do we understand these claims, 
	how do we comprehend this peep in to the past? How do we distinguish fact 
	from fiction, history from mythology? To reconcile history, science and 
	mythology are the complex questions in our public life. To begin with 
	history of events has some definitive characteristics, though their 
	interpretations do vary with the political ideologies. But what about 
	mythology? Here these accounts have been put forward as the fictional 
	accounts of the past. Some of these accounts have been associated with 
	faith. Faith to some extent is natural and sometimes it is being 
	manufactured and asserted for political goals. As far as Lord Ram's story 
	goes there are several versions of Ramayana, (Many Ramayanas, Richman, OUP). 
	Some of these are very popular like Valmiki Ramayana and Tulasidas 
	Ramcharitmanas. Surely the most popular one currently is the one from 
	Maharashi Ramanand Sagar's mega serial which captivated the nation for 
	couple of years. There are other versions, which have been undermined and 
	attacked mostly for political reasons. Sahmat exhibition on different 
	versions of Lord Ram's story was attacked few years ago. Some politically 
	motivated people could not bear one of the versions presented in this 
	exhibition. It showed that according to Jataka version of Ram Katha, in post 
	Brahminical Buddhist Dashrath Jataka Sita is both as sister and wife of Ram. 
	As per this version Dashrath is King not of Ayodhya but of Varanasi. The 
	marriage of sister and brother is part of the tradition of glorious Kshtriya 
	clans who wanted to maintain their caste and clan purity. This Jataka tale 
	shows Ram to be the follower of Buddha. Similarly in Jain versions of 
	Ramayana project Ram as the propagator of anti-Brahminical Jain values, 
	especially as a follower of non-violence. What do both Buddhist and Jain 
	version have in common is that in these Ravana is not shown as a villain but 
	a great soul dedicated to quest of knowledge and is a spiritual soul, with 
	majestic commands over passions, a sage and a responsible ruler. Popular and 
	prevalent 'Women's Ramayan Songs (of Telugu Brahmin Women), put together by 
	Rangnyakmma, keep the women's concern as the central theme and present 
	alternate perspective. These songs present Sita as finally victorious over 
	Ram and in these Surpanakha succeeds in taking revenge over Ram. Prof. 
	Victor Raja Mannikam, of Satara University points out (Times of India 14th 
	Sept 2007) that this epic dates back to 5000 years while Ramar Setu is over 
	a lakh years old. Prof. V.S. Sahay of Anthropology Department of Allahbad 
	University says that the society described in Ramayana represents Metal age 
	(5000-6000 BC) and Ram's Vanar army has not constructed the structure as it 
	belongs to Pleistocene Age which shows emergence of stone tools. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Marine experts tell us that the setu 
	itself is a marine structure over a lakh years old and not man made. It is a 
	natural occurrence of the continuity of sandstone sedimentation which 
	stretches below Dhanushkoti and isotope dating indicates that the deposition 
	is over a lakh years old (Prof. R. Mannikam). Thus one can conclude that 
	Ramar Sethu is a much older structure, called tombol, a sand deposition due 
	to natural process, connecting one land with another, and that it is from 
	times when human habitation is doubtful. The Geological Survey of India has 
	also ruled out its being the manmade (or monkey made!), construction. Same 
	way the inference from NASA satellite pictures is that it is due to 
	sedimentation of clay and lime stone. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many people dispute that the Lanka 
	mentioned in Ramayana is not the current Sri Lanka. Since mythology does not 
	require any proof it can be modulated and constructed in to a faith for 
	political purposes. Recently in the Shabri Kumbh held in Dangs in Gujarat, 
	the mythology was modulated in to the service of politics. It was said, and 
	that too with great amount of precision, that a particular hillock, which 
	was earlier called Chamak Dongar, which adivasis used to worship as Shivar 
	Deo (protector of crops), was the precise place where Shabri had offered 
	berries to Lord Ram. It was rechristened and a Shabri temple was built on 
	the spot. Nearby, a river six kilometers away, Purna was named as the one 
	where Guru Matang rishi use to take bath. On the mountain on the stone there 
	were three marks which are being presented as the marks where Laxman had 
	sharpened his arrows. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The one step back of Congress 
	leadership, Sonia Gandhi in particular, is to try to prevent giving an 
	emotional handle to RSS combine, who are desperately looking to build up 
	another emotive issue the way they constructed the politics around Babri 
	Mosque. The search for an issue is desperate as the Ram temple issue is no 
	longer en-cashable in the electoral arena, the primary concern of BJP. The 
	attitude of Congress leadership can be understood only in this light, else 
	the affidavit filed by Archeological survey is on the dot and scientific to 
	the core. One witnessed the similar display of retreat when Sonia Gandhi was 
	to become the Prime Minister. Faced with the threat of some BJP leaders 
	shaving their heads and eating just gram, and the emotive hysteria which had 
	the potential of engulfing the national politics, Mrs. Gandhi decided to 
	give up the post, deflating the whole game, depriving them of a issue and 
	depriving the nation of the sight of Sanyasin like leaders, with bald head 
	etc. One is not sure whether even now such a process of deflating the issue 
	in the initial stages is possible. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is easy to construct a fly over 
	to the future but difficult to prevent the formation of mythological bridges 
	of the past. Mythology can easily be constructed and planted in the people's 
	psyche as it is driven by political goals and rides on horse of emotion. 
	Reason and logic have no place in this scheme of things. One knows that some 
	Mullahs, having faith in the infinite power of djinns advocated their rulers 
	to invest in the research for making more djinns so that power crisis can be 
	solved. Also with the resurgence of fundamentalism one is hearing that 
	Creation science is back in the race to compete with the theories of 
	evolution. The question is, should we misuse faith, faith which can be an 
	assuaging balm, for building political agendas?</font></p>
