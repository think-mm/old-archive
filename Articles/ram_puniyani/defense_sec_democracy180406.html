		western countries are playing for Christianity, while Hindus have no 
		such country for them as India is, ‘Secularism in one country’. 
		According to him Indian state has/had equal contempt for all religions. 
		He presents the arguments of Hindutva politics in a sympathetic way and

	<p>-- <b><font color="#008000">Rejoinder to Should we Legalise Opium- 
	J.N.Bhagwati (Outlook April 10 2006)</font></b></p>
	<p>&nbsp;<font color="#800000"><b>In Defense of Secularism and Democracy </b>
	</font></p>
	<p>Ram Puniyani </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jagdish N. Bhagwti’s, “Should we 
	Legalise Opium” (Outlook, 100406) is flawed at both factual and conceptual 
	level. Let’s have a look at facts first. Contrary to what Bhagwati states, 
	the tragic death of 58 Hindus in Sabarmati express was not a massacre but 
	result of an accident, which Modi on purpose projected as the onslaught of 
	Islamic terrorists without any proof. The analysis of events, report of 
	Forensic Laboratory (Ahamedabad) and the Bannerjee Commission report have 
	shown this. The killings of Muslims in the post Godhra tragedy was not a 
	‘tit for tat’ killing but a planned pogrom by the BJP ruled state 
	Government, which has become indistinguishable from the outfit of RSS and 
	its affiliates. The missionary, who was burnt, Pastor Graham Stains, was not 
	proselytizing as shown by Wadhwa Commission report. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religious practices of all religions 
	were respected by the Nehruvian state. The Kumbh Melas were taken care of 
	and the Haj pilgrims were provided subsidies. Is it what Bhagwati calls as 
	‘contempt for all religions’? Bhagwati is disturbed by the fact that there 
	was appeasement of Muslim minority. What was this appeasement? In no way 
	their representation in cabinets and elected offices has shown any semblance 
	of appeasement. As a matter of fact in Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabhas the 
	proportion of elected representatives from amongst Muslims has been 
	declining constantly over a period of years, all over the country. The 
	Muslim representation in Judiciary and bureaucracy and police force is 
	abysmally low. One is surprised that an intellectual of his stature is 
	unaware of these basic facts! Surely the incidents like Shah Bano were the 
	one’s where the Muslim fundamentalists (section of Maulanas) were appeased 
	but the Muslim community as a whole has been sliding down on the indices of 
	human development. Gopal Singh Commission did bring it out. It is the 
	cleverness of RSS propaganda that they could let the Hindus at large believe 
	that Muslims are being appeased. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ‘Hindus are feeling agitated’ is 
	the constant propaganda of Hindu right wing organizations. It is a move to 
	deflect the social discontent in general. The idea is to show that it is due 
	to Muslim appeasement that Hindus are suffering. As a social phenomenon it 
	is not anything which is new. Hitler did similar manipulation of social 
	thought some decades ago. The overall dissatisfaction of German society was 
	attributed to the Jews and what happened next is too horrible to recount. 
	Currently also the rise of discontent in the earthly matters has been 
	shifted to the communal terrain. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indian state, the Nehruvian model, 
	was principally secular but the society was in the grip of religion, 
	religious clergy to be precise. In most of these matters the dichotomy of 
	Gandhi and Nehru has no substance. Though challenging this is going against 
	the grain of broadly accepted social thinking, the fact is that Nehru, a 
	socialist of sorts, did respect the religious feelings of people and Gandhi 
	while talking in the language of religion was secular to the core as far as 
	the polices of the state were concerned. Somanath temple reconstruction by 
	the state was opposed by both, though in different languages. Nehru saying 
	it is not the business of state to build the places of worship (incidentally 
	he also used the religious imagery while describing modern industries and 
	places of modern learning as the new temples of India), while Gandhi saying 
	that Hindus do not require the assistance of the state to build a temple.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As far as respecting the practices 
	of followers of different religions are concerned, it applied equally to 
	all. If at all, it were not Muslim, as pointed out by Bhagwati, but Hindu 
	norms and deities which entered in the secular space, police stations, 
	public places of various sorts, the practice of inauguration of new projects 
	by breaking coconut and having full Hindu rituals at such occasions. He 
	falls prey to the prevalent notions in an uncritical way to accept that 
	Muslim practices were respected at the cost of the practices of other 
	religions. As far as Hindu Code bill was concerned it was initiated by the 
	independent state not because they wanted to tamper only with Hindu norms 
	but because Nehru-Ambedkar duo wanted to set an example to all the 
	communities by beginning with the largest community, so that others take the 
	lead and initiate the same in their communities. It is because of the 
	opposition to this bill, and its subsequent dilution that they had to give 
	up. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While Bhagawati understands the role 
	of Pakistan, it needs to be added that Pakistan could promote terrorism in 
	Kashmir only because the democratic processes in Kashmir were strangulated 
	with the arrest of Sheikh Abdullah, who wanted the Indian government to 
	stick to the treaty of accession, which gave autonomy to Kashmir, and not to 
	trample on the wishes of Kashmiri people. Later US initiated and sponsored 
	Al Qaeda terrorists joined in to complicate the problem in Kashmir in 
	particular and India in general. The political backdrop of this is important 
	so that we do not reduce the political phenomenon into religious ones.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The psychology of NRIs who are 
	trying to show their long distance patriotism is very interesting 
	phenomenon. I will concede one of the factors for supporting Hindu right by 
	NRIs is that NRIs cannot digest the notion of gender equality, what ever be 
	its degree, prevalent in the lands where they inhabit. The other point, that 
	every person feels that a state should play for their religion, is a make 
	believe social common sense drilled in to the heads of section of Indians 
	and to alienated insecure NRIs. Religion and nationalism are two separate 
	entities. Bhagwati is committing a factual error to state that all Muslim 
	countries come together in their foreign policies. He seems to have 
	forgotten seven year’s long Iraq-Iran war and the divergent attitude of 
	Muslim countries to the US invasion of Iraq just a couple of years back.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hinduism is not a prophet based 
	religion, it is exclusionary because of its caste system so it is generally 
	not propagated, its’ not open for others to adopt it, so logically it has 
	major following in the country of its origin only, unlike Christianity and 
	Islam which spread far and wide. Earlier this ‘nation playing for my 
	religion’ was never a point of discomfort. Of course there is the Hindu 
	Rashtra of Nepal for those who want some state to play for Hinduism. Till 
	just decades ago it was difficult to say that the Britain and US are 
	Christian countries. It is unfortunate that setting up of terrorist outfits, 
	Al Qaeda, by US, to drive the USSR's armies away from Afghanistan, has taken 
	the logical course of promoting fundamentalism amongst it promoters 
	themselves, where by 9/11 and London tube blasts are taking place, giving a 
	fillip to fundamentalism in these democracies also. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It will be sweeping to call all the 
	Western democracies as mere religious Christian states and helpless Hindus 
	are just having India as the sole secular state, ‘Secularism in one state’. 
	The point is, secularization process which was on ascendance in the decades 
	of 50s and went on till 70s is being pushed back. Democracy-Secularism are 
	not fixed entities, they are in a state of flux depending on the interests 
	and opposition of diverse social forces Western democracies have 
	predominantly secular currents even today. The formulation of secularism in 
	one country as the tragedy of India is the ‘brilliant’ Hindutva formulation, 
	though no where near the truth. In the times when Godses’ concept of 
	nationalism seems to be coming to the fore, the learned Professor needs to 
	be reminded about what Gandhi, Godse’s victim, wrote on these matters, on 
	religious freedom and secular state, &quot;In India, for whose fashioning I have 
	worked all my life, every man enjoys equality of status, whatever his 
	religion is. The state is bound to be wholly secular…religion is not the 
	test of nationality but is a personal matter between man and God… religion 
	is a personal affair of each individual, it must not be mixed up with 
	politics or national affairs&quot;</font></p>
