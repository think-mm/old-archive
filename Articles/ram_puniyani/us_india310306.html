	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The visit of George W. Bush to 
	finalize the nuclear deal witnessed the anguish of people getting expressed 
	in massive protests from diverse sections of society, the followers of 
	progressive, left and different shades of Muslims groups. The large section 
	of English press and elite were ga ga about the ultimate realization of 
	their dreams, US-India alliance coming to fruition. Not too many critical 
	sections asked as to why has US, which never helped India with the 
	technology during the crucial period of its development, which never helped 
	India in any way in its technological foundations, which never supported 
	India on the issues of security and which had been putting sanctions on 
	India on this or the other pretext, has been surging with warmth and 
	camaraderie from last decade or so. No doubt Indian foreign policy has been 
	bowing to woo the US on every conceivable occasion, starting from supporting 
	its star war programs to offering military bases when it was attacking to 
	occupy Afghanistan, to its vote on Iran. The major hints were dropped from 
	US about its intentions to warm up its relations with India. No doubt US has 
	been the dominating influence on Pakistan’s policies as there are US 
	military bases and it has been supported by US in various ways. It is US 
	which has to take lot of blame for the Kashmir imbroglio which has been 
	tormenting the Kashmiri people. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India had been a victim of US 
	foreign policy in most of the areas from the decade of 50s to 80s. This was 
	the real period for the growth of the infrastructure based on which today 
	the economy is growing by leaps and bounds. During this era India resorted 
	to the public sector for the growth of its industries, and US point blank 
	refused to support India in any way. Globally, US kept allying with all 
	sorts of dictators and despots, had been planting many of them in various 
	countries. The language used by US during this period was that World is 
	facing the threat from communism. It presented its goals as defense of 
	freedom and democracy. Its policies, on the contrary, abolished and brutally 
	killed democratic governments in country after country. Iran 1953 and Chile 
	in 1973 being the foremost examples where the democratically elected 
	governments were finished off and the despots were installed as the rulers.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the cold was era US had to be 
	cautious as the might of USSR was quiet matching in various areas and it 
	could not steam roll its imperialist designs with ease. During this bipolar 
	World, many a countries could struggle to gain independence, under different 
	flags. Its atrocities in Vietnam to suppress the national aspirations of 
	Vietnamese will be the benchmark of barbarism of worst type in the history. 
	The might of colonial powers of yesteryears, Britain, France, and Holland 
	etc. declined and gave way to the US hegemony in the decades to come. US 
	arrival as the big bully was marked by its dropping of the nuclear bomb on 
	Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which were primarily aimed to assert its rise as the 
	super power in the World. It became the first and only country to use this 
	demonic Nuclear weapon killing lakhs of innocent human beings, showing the 
	barbarism of its policies. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With the USSR posing an alternate 
	pole of global power, many a countries could come out from the colonial yoke 
	to begin the foundations of their own development as independent countries. 
	The end of second World war, the war for the hegemony of the colonies, ended 
	in the defeat of one pole of imperialism, the axis powers, Germany and Japan 
	and also went on to sow the seed of the emergence of newer equations in the 
	form of formation of Israel, which was the perfect tool for US to operate in 
	the West Asia. The two giants of the international arena kept clashing and 
	dominating the global scene. Two heartening factors during this era were 
	that the group of nations came up as the Non Aligned nations, and the 
	development of regional endeavors of cooperation like European Union, SAARC 
	and the moral, ethical and political acceptance of UN as the arbiter of 
	World disputes. The seeds of industrial development of some of these 
	countries, which were colonies earlier, like China and India also started 
	sprouting during this period. Apart from other developments the manpower for 
	knowledge industry, IT sector was the major development in some of these 
	countries, more so over in India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The collapse of USSR was the major 
	turning point of the global equations. Now the World was left with a single 
	hegemonic nation, with insatiable appetite for ammunition, nuclear weapons, 
	and an expenditure on military purposes which runs into astronomical figures 
	and may be more than the total budget of many smaller countries put 
	together. US economy revolved more and more in the dealing of armaments and 
	reveled in selling arms to the warring factions, one of which was invariably 
	propped up by US itself. With the decline of USSR the multiple phenomenon 
	which came to fore were the intensification of adverse effects of 
	globalization in various counties including in India, the increased military 
	presence of US in West Asia, its propping up of Al Qaeda through the ISI of 
	Pakistan and the rise of fundamentalism in the region as a response to the 
	US policies of suppressing the local democratic aspiration. In India it was 
	also the period of rise of middle classes and the reversal of the 
	progressive values, which were replaced by conservatism of high order and 
	rise of faith based phenomenon, rise of religiosity, and emergence of 
	Hindutva as the major challenger to the Indian constitution and democracy.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With the Ayatollah Khomeini 
	revolution in Iran, which in a way was the long term impact of US act of 
	overthrowing Mossadeq and installing Raza Shah Pehlavi, US propaganda 
	machine came out openly to declare that Islam is the new threat to World 
	civilization. The McCarthyism, the projection of Communism as the threat to 
	freedom and democracy got gradually replaced by anti Islamism. The 
	theoretical formulation of US political need came form Samuel Huntington who 
	went on to propound the ‘Clash of Civilization’ thesis. As per this thesis, 
	the contemporary problem is that World is witnessing a clash between the 
	backward Islamic civilization and the advanced Western civilization. Put in 
	other words the hint was that advanced western civilization is the savior of 
	Humanity and the backward Islam is the obstacle to the path of World 
	progress, freedom and democracy. Interestingly colonialists, imperialists 
	project themselves above the religious identity. When British were rampaging 
	India, they periodized Indian history as Ancient Hindu period, medieval 
	Muslim period and Modern British period. The deceit of these forces is 
	unmistakable. The colonial powers, the oppressors, always need to project an 
	enemy to consolidate their hegemony. During cold war era US propaganda 
	machine succeeded in demonizing communism and currently it is Islam, the 
	Muslims which have been demonized through various mechanisms. The social 
	common sense in the previous decades was against communism, today Islam and 
	Muslims occupy that slot and all around one can hear the arguments about, 
	violence, terror and other attributes being inherent to Islam. Doctoring of 
	mass consciousness against Muslims is complete by now. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With collapse of USSR, US started 
	feeling easy and its focus on west Asia to control its oil wealth found the 
	expression in its aggressive foreign policy and its continuing blind support 
	to Israel. It did float Al Qaeda and brought in the word Jihad as a war cry 
	for Al Qaeda and for its attack on the communists in Afghanistan. In the 
	process it achieved the twin purposes of taking the revenge of its 
	humiliating defeat in Vietnam and at the same time bringing the oil rich 
	area under its military and political control. This period of World History 
	is dominated by the return of the language of religion in politics, the 
	conservatism in social life and rising differential between haves and have 
	not's. With all its drawbacks, the presence of USSR was not only a check on 
	the domination of US but also a provider of space for the development of 
	democratic values, the struggle to strive for substantive Liberty Equality 
	and Fraternity (Community). With world facing a single bully in the form of 
	US the progressive, democratic values and culture took a nose dive. Looking 
	from India one can see the cultural deterioration, rise of conservatism as 
	reflected in the Hindi films, serials, in thee rise of Babas, Acharyas and 
	their clan doing successful business. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religious identity and the politics 
	based on it, which had taken a back seat during the era of national 
	liberation, struck back strongly, mostly coming to center stage of the 
	national life in many a countries. US, which at home was having a good deal 
	of radical progressivism, started wilting under the multinationals policies, 
	and fundamentalism which was a phenomenon of 1930s started making a come 
	back, more so after 9/11. US schizophrenia of liberalism at home and 
	promotion of despots abroad started giving way to the logical trajectory and 
	today Christian right is a strong presence there, Bush being one of a sample 
	from this segment. Earlier Bush had manipulated his victory, this time God, 
	Gays and Guns were the essential component of the victory kit of George W 
	Bush, the contemporary World Emperor. The release of tape by Osama just few 
	days ahead of the polling date signified the deeper links of Al Qaeda and 
	Bush. These alliances do not remain in part they do try to become holistic 
	over a period of time and it is likely that US conservatism will become 
	stronger over a period of time. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Meanwhile the demonization of Islam 
	and Muslims picked up severely and in the aftermath of 9/11 Osama, terrorism 
	and Muslims are being projected as synonyms. The deeper issue of the 
	imperialist lust for oil and political hegemony has been cleverly put under 
	the carpet by the propaganda machinery, ever willing and capable of 
	Manufacturing Consent or doctoring mass consciousness. The parallelism of 
	these processes Worldwide and in India is too striking to be recounted. BJPs 
	coming to power at center not only manifested the retrograde degeneration of 
	democratic norms and values it also went into make a strong effort to 
	subjugate India’s foreign policy to the US. The ‘Fight against terrorism’ 
	became the slogan of Hindu rights’ campaign to consolidate its power by 
	demonizing the Muslims as terrorists. The BJP, as the political child of 
	RSS, aimed and aims to primarily suppress the rights of downtrodden, dalits, 
	workers, and women. Minorities in a way are the collateral victims of its 
	politics; Muslims minorities are being converted into the new untouchables 
	as the Hindu Rashtra of Gujarat demonstrates. Muslims world wide are the 
	sacrificial goats of the imperialist lust for control of oil and politics of 
	the World. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is in this background that the 
	tilt in US foreign policy has to be seen. It has enjoyed the status and 
	power of monarch during last two decades. Now the global equations are 
	shifting and China is emerging as a major economic and military power. 
	During US aggression against Iraq, barring the World peace movement, the 
	groups of scattered peace-lovers world over, there was no significant 
	opposition to the US unilateralism. When one is using the word US, UK is the 
	integral part of this word. It has to be kept in mind that it is during this 
	period that US chose to trample upon the United Nation and its political and 
	moral authority. All through during earlier times also it had protected 
	Israel when it blatantly violated the UN resolutions. Now as seen in the 
	cases of Afghanistan and Iraq it first bypassed and than swallowed UN in a 
	single gulp. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now with the rise of China, there is 
	a perception that it may emerge as the alternative pole of power. India not 
	only has the strategic location, it also is emerging as a fairly strong, 
	nation in its own right. Here one is using the term strong in the 
	conventional sense, military power, nukes and the affluence of the handfuls. 
	The real strength of the nation should come from the well being of all 
	citizens is another matter, not being taken up here as it does not command 
	battalions in the contemporary World. The present US worry is to preempt the 
	rise of China as the alternative pole, challenging its hegemony, which it 
	has become used to enjoying, dictating World policies from the White house. 
	Attacking and reprimanding weak countries at will and treating the concept 
	of democracy amongst the nations of the World, with contempt. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The bamboo curtain had already 
	served China well, to develop its strength by the use of controlled labor 
	market and violations of the norms of labor relations. Notwithstanding that, 
	it is emerging as a force which can take on US might some day. US has seen 
	that its concept of progress and development goes well where the section of 
	middle class prospers. It is those countries which ape at it and aspire to 
	associate with its glamour and exploitative political system. US knows, 
	India today is exactly in this state and by wooing it over to her side, it 
	will be creating a potential coalition in which it can continue to rule the 
	roost and also put at bay the possibility of China posing as a threat to its 
	imperialist lust in times to come. Bush couldn’t have been happier after his 
	visit to India, he got all he wanted and some protesters burning his effigy 
	everywhere may not be of much consequence to the mighty administration being 
	presided over by him. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Can we retrieve the ground? Can we 
	think of India’s foreign policy retrieving its non alignment and not just be 
	and act as a pawn in the hands of US designs of continuing to rule the 
	World? It may sound as if the protests have gone in vain, that US will 
	steamroll India’s foreign policy. It is a question of how the progressive 
	sections continue their pressure, how over a period of time they can sustain 
	the concerns of average people for the right to life and keep speaking for 
	policies which look at the human beings as the citizens, who deserve and 
	should get what is enshrined in the UN Charter of human rights. The bringing 
	together of different countries to face up to the onslaught of US foreign 
	policy is a must. It can attack country after country and get away with 
	giving explanations which are neither just nor acceptable to the World 
	community. This alliance of non aligned countries can come up with the 
	Global peace movement raising its voice against the adverse economic and 
	political policy of the World bully. Its time this becomes central agenda of 
	human rights groups.</font></p>
