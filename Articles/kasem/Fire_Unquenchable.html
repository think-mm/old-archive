  <p>Any reader, having the slightest conscience could not but be unnerved by
  reading the five episodes of ‘<b>Hishab Milena, Uttor Paina</b>' ( <b><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/minority/BARUA_Hishab.pdf">Part1</a>&nbsp;

  )</b>. Many readers have dismissed his language of outburst of emotion as
  tasteless, improper and unkind. It is true that he has used extremely coarse
  language to raise the ire in a section of Bangladeshi people of a particular
  religion. However, I do not think that his intention was to lump all the
  Muslims as the scum of society. His is extremely distraught, severely shaken
  and utterly in pain reminiscing some horrible chapters of minority persecution
  perpetrated by his own flesh and blood (I mean Bengali). I may not like the
  use of his coarse language, but I must concur with what he had written to be
  very much true. Why? It is because, I myself, had the experience to witness
  the hapless condition of the Chakma and other tribal people. This happened
  around 1972-73, immediately after the liberation of Bangladesh. During this
  period, I was posted as a site engineer to supervise the survey work for
  Karnaphuli irrigation project encompassing some major rivers and tributaries
  running around Chittagong Hill Tract district. My daily site supervision used
  to take me to places like, Bandarban, Rangamati…etc. Poverty in Bangladesh
  is endemic, but witnessing the dire poverty and the miserable living
  conditions of these Hill Tract tribal people was absolutely disturbing. I
  could not believe that a section of Bangladeshi people could endure such
  degrading living style. However, it was the charming smile and their affable
  nature that impressed me most. During that time, there was very little signs
  of religious persecution or land grabbing incidence sanctioned by the
  Bangladesh Government, although I came to learn from some of my local staff
  that the Government was drawing up a plan to resettle some Bengali in those
  mountain regions. My stint with these innocent natives was very short.
  Nevertheless, I always remember their good-natured greetings, hospitality and
  the infectious smiles they always offered me whenever I chanced to meet them.</p>
  <p>It breaks my heart when I read the stories of mindless persecution that is
  inflicted on our minority population, mostly by the Islamic goons. Staying in
  an infidel country as a minority within a minority (that is, a microscopic
  minority), I, sometimes wonder, what could I do, if suddenly, these infidels
  attack me or say, my neighbor starts vilifying me, knowing quite well, from my
  name that I could belong to Islam. But no, nothing has happened to me. No one
  has ever asked me where did come from, what is my name, what is my religion,
  where do I live……….? Imagine now, if I were a Buddhist/Hindu/Christian
  surviving in an Islamic Paradise. I would certainly be subjected to the
  torment that Mr Barua has described so vividly. <b>It is a shame on us, the
  entire Bangladeshi Muslims that we have failed miserably to protect the
  minimum rights of our own flesh and blood who, by chance, happen to belong to
  another religion that Islam hates to accommodate. </b>Mind you, historical
  records show that most Bangladeshis were Buddhists before Islam was imposed on
  them through various means.</p>
  <p>Let us look at the mirror. Let us look at our past. What do we see? Do we
  see how Pakistani Islamic army had treated us? Don’t you think that our
  army, in cooperation with the Islamic Jihadists, has indeed taken up the role
  of tormentor to these tribal people just as what Pakistani army did to us? Don’t
  you think that Islam has something to do with it? Don’t you realize that our
  armed force is now infested with the Islamic Jihadists? Where do they get
  their motivation from? Think of it. It will be foolish not to realize that the
  Islamists have a grand plan. The plan is to uproot the native people from
  their ancestral lands and establish Islamic paradise, first in this hill
  district. That is why most clandestine Islamic Terrorists training camps are
  located here.</p>
  <p><b>In his heart, Mr Barua has a fire. It is the same fire that I still
  possess deep inside me, the unquenchable fire that was kindled when my
  parents, my brother and my sisters were gravely humiliated by the Islamic
  Jawans of Pakistan army.</b> <b>How could I forget and forgive?</b> How could
  I ever reconcile when I vividly recollect those tormenting days of absolute
  terror! No, this fire will burn forever until all the perpetrators who had
  tormented my parents, tried to violate my mother and sisters and threatened to
  kill my brother are brought to justice.</p>
  <p>Has Bangladesh no conscience? Has Bangladesh forgotten its past? It is a
  shame on us. We do not deserve this freedom when we repeat what the Pakistan
  army did to us.</p>
  <p>No, Br. Barua can never forget and forgive, for sure.</p>
  <p>Beware of the rage and the revenge of a patient man.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>PS: It is very rare that I express my comment on any article/essay. But
    Mr. Barua compelled me to pen this short rejoinder. I am sorry that I could
    not write it in Bengali as I do not have the appropriate software.</p>
