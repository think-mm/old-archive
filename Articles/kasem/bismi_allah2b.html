	<br>
	</font></b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">So, where precisely Allah lived 
	before He sent Muhammad to Mecca? Since Arabia in particular and the Middle 
	East in general, are mountainous, we should not be surprised that Allah 
	loves mountains, especially the mountains of Arabia and its neighbouring 
	areas. No wonder, we find many verses in the Qur’an which say that 
	Muhammad’s Allah indeed lived in caves, before Muhammad was born. Here are a 
	few verses from the Qur’an.<br>
	<br>
	When Moses was close to the fire, a voice praised Allah and those 
	surrounding the fire–<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/027.qmt.html">27:8</a>.<br>
	<br>
	Muhammad was not present when Allah gave the command to Moses on the western 
	side of the Mountain–<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/028.qmt.html">28:44</a>.</font></span></font></p>

	loves to dwell in cities<br>
	</font></b><span style="COLOR: blue"><font size="2"><br>
	</font></span><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">Allah always has a great 
	fascination for large cities like Mecca. He cares very little about rural or 
	suburban areas. Nowhere in the Qur’an do we find examples that He ever cared 
	for the rural folks. This is understandable when we realise that Allah does 
	actually reside in a metropolitan city such as Mecca. This is the 
	birth-place of Muhammad, Allah’s greatest friend and compatriot. Naturally, 
	Allah would never like to depart from this location. Allah’s interest in 
	huge cities never ends. Some times He likes to destroy and redeem big 
	cities. Here are some sample verses from the Qur’an which tell us that Allah 
	sends messengers and warners only to cities.<br>
	<br>
	Allah will not destroy a population until an apostle is sent to a major city 
	(Allah sends His messenger only to a major town) as a warner–<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/028.qmt.html">28:59</a>.<br>
	<br>
	Allah sent an Arabic Qur’an to Muhammad to warn the people in the 
	neighbourhood of the city of Mecca (Islam is only for the Meccans, the city 
	dwellers)...<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/042.qmt.html">42:7</a>.<br>
	<br>
	Even today, Allah’s deep interest in gigantic cities lives on. That is why 
	he sends His soldiers to destroy mega cities like New York, London, Madrid, 
	Istanbul, Delhi, Baransi, Dhaka, Cairo–and so on to redeem their inhabitants 
	from their calumnies and to fully Islamise these cities.</font></span></font></p>

	<br>
	</font></b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">Here are a few ahadith which 
	say that Allah does have symbols (just like the Pagan idols).<br>
	<br>
	The early Muslims were reluctant to run between Safwa and Marwa like the 
	Pagans did; but Allah decreed that Safwa and Marwa were two sacred places 
	(2:158)–(Sahih Bukhari,
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/026.sbt.html">
	2.26.706</a>,<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/026.sbt.html">710</a>).<br>
	<br>
	Muhammad wanted to continue with the Pagan tradition, so Allah revealed (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html">2:158</a>) 
	that Safa and Marwa were two symbols of Allah. So it is all right to 
	ambulate <i>(Tawaf)</i> between them– (Sahih Bukhari,
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/060.sbt.html">
	6.60.22</a>).<br>
	<br>
	When the Ghassan asked Muhammad about circumambulation between Safa and 
	Marwa Allah revealed, “Verily al-Safa' and al-Marwa are among the Signs of 
	Allah”– (Sahih Muslim,
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/007.smt.html">
	7.2927</a>,
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/muslim/007.smt.html">
	2928</a>).<br>
	<br>
	Not only that Safwa and Marwa, the two mountains in Mecca are two physical 
	symbols of Allah, the moon and the sun are also Allah’s symbols. The Pagans 
	had been correct al along, Muhammad confirmed. Let us read this hadith.<br>
	<br>
	The Sun and the Moon are the two signs of Allah; they do not prostrate 
	because of someone’s death– (Sahih Bukhari,
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/054.sbt.html">

	</font></b><font size="2">The Islamists will find it extremely tough to 
	digest what is written in the above caption. But a careful study of the most 
	authentic sources of Islam reveal a great secret—Islam is deeply mired in 
	idolatry. As written before, no matter how much Muhammad had tried, he could 
	not, shake out his Pagan origin. He believed in the stones having life, in 
	the speaking powers of inanimate objects and in the ability of some rocks 
	(i.e. the rocks of Ka’ba) to become alive, with hands and eyes. <br>
	<br>
	The most eminent Islamic scholar, Imam Ghazali (many Muslims consider his 
	writings as next to the Qur’an and ahadith) wrote that the Blackstone (of 
	Ka’ba) is a jewel from Paradise. It will be raised on the resurrection day. 
	It will have two eyes and one tongue with which it will speak. It will bear 
	witness for everyone who kissed it and testified its truth (Ghazali, 1993, 
	p. 1.190). <br>

	Incredible though it might sound, even today, the single most revered object 
	in Islam is a piece of stone—the stone of Ka’ba. Faithful Muslims turn 
	towards it every day—five times, to worship—in the name of Allah. This was

	<font size="2">before that the concept of one–moon Allah was nothing new to 
	the Pagans of Mecca. They were absolutely familiar with this all-powerful, 
	almighty, benevolent (at times) and utterly destructive (at times) nature of 
	Allah. When the Islamist scholars talk about Allah, they would like to give 
	the impression that Allah was something unique that Muhammad alone knew 
	about. What the Pagans of Mecca did not like about Muhammad was that he 
	imposed on the easy–going, secular–minded gullible Pagans his own idea about 
	this powerful moon deity, Allah. With his invention of a new Allah, Muhammad 
	tried to ridicule the Allah these Pagans knew about for millenniums. They 
	used to name their children with Allah’s name. Even Muhammad’s father’s name 
	was Abd Allah. Here are a few comments from eminent scholars and from the 
	primary sources of Islam which irrefutably prove that the Pagans were ever 
	cognisant about Allah, that Muhammad simply confused those Meccans.<br>
	<br>
	Muhammad did not invent the concept of the unity of Allah; this concept was

	The Pagans thought that the angels were females and they (the angels) are 
	the daughters of Allah; Allah vehemently rejects this idea–<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/037.qmt.html">37:149-150</a>.<br>

	<span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a foot note on this

	<br>
	The polytheists believed in the existence of One Supreme Deity but they also 
	believed that there were some other deities also who were to be worshipped 
	besides them (Siddiqi, 2004, v.2, p. .704, foot note 1596).<br>
	<br>
	All those references prove, without any doubt, that the Pagans of Mecca had 
	no problem with Allah. They were very much devoted to their Allah without 
	any trouble whatsoever. They did not do any acts for which Muhammad should 
	despise them and declare war on them. So why was it that Muhammad had to be 
	so vicious towards them, to force them to believe in his version Allah? The 
	answer to this question is that Muhammad craved attention and praise. With 
	his lowly background and nothing to offer to the Quraysh he was searching 
	for a method—a pretext to ridicule, despise, insult and blaspheme the Meccan 
	Pagans and their religions to grab attention. A waif, deprived of love, 
	affection, care and protection during childhood, he simply hankered for 
	those exceedingly powerful human emotions. <br>
	<br>
	Muhammad, therefore, turned to Allah to seek His love and absolute 
	attention. He declared himself to be the greatest friend and confidante (as 
	if, Allah, too, hankered for his love and care) of the Allah of the Pagan 
	Arabs, whom all the Pagans revered with utmost ardour. This was a failsafe 
	method by which Muhammad could get what he missed out in his dejected, 
	lonely and featureless childhood.<br>
	<br>
	Sahih Bukhari provides the reason why, all on a sudden, Allah decided to 
	hate and deplore the Pagan Meccans. It was simply because Allah was in love 
	with Muhammad, while the Pagans did not love him. So Allah had to abandon 
	these Bedouin folks in favour of Muhammad. Muhammad became Allah’s most 
	favourite person. Let us read this hadith.</font></span></p>

	<font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">In the beginning Muhammad was not 
	sure of his Allah.<br>
	</font></b><font size="2">When we learn what Muhammad was up to with his 
	Allah, we can derive only one conclusion: confusion and hesitancy. In the 
	beginning, In the beginning Muhammad was not so sure who should be his 
	Allah—ar-Rahman, ar—Rahim, Allat, Uzza, Wadd, Hubal, Aziz–or any other 
	numerous deities that the Meccan Pagans used to worship. Besides Hubal, 
	Allah, Allat, Uzza, Manat–each tribe in Arabia, had their own favorite idol 
	or deity. This is confirmed from the <i>Sirah</i> (biography) of ibn Ishaq. 
	As an example, he writes that Hudhayl b. Mudrika b. Ilyas b. Mudar adopted 
	Suwa. Suwa was at Ruhat, a place near Yanbu. Kalb b. Wabra of Quba adopted 
	Wudd in Dumat al-Jandal (ibn Ishaq, 2001, p. 36).<br>
	<br>
	Even in the Qur’an we read the obsession of the Arabs with idols. Here are 
	two verses from the Qur’an which tell us about the worshipping of various 
	idols by the people of Noah.<br>
	<br>
	</font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">Noah complained to Allah that 
	people with money and children were the most corrupt on earth and they 
	refused to abandon their idols Wadd, Suwa, Yaguth, Yau’q and<br>
	Nasr –<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/071.qmt.html">71:21-23</a>.<br>
	</font></span><font size="2"><br>
	With so much idolatry in practice and with so many deities around, Muhammad, 
	in the beginning of his career as a Prophet, was utterly indecisive. He 
	tried a few other brands of Allah; was disappointed with the response from 
	his audience and changed his mind several times. In the end, he realized 
	that all the Pagans, despite their numerous idols, had one aspect in common: 
	all of them were wholly devoted to their moon God, Allah, because they 
	believed that Allah had the wherewithal to inflict punishment as well as 
	rewards. This last reason propelled Muhammad to turn to Allah to be his 
	succor. This worked wonderfully, since no Arab could reject their variety of 
	Allah, even tough they were also totally confused with the new version of 
	Allah that Muhammad was pushing to them.<br>
	<br>
	Here are a few comments on the hesitancy and confusion in Muhammad about his 
	Allah.</font></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana"><font size="2">First we read the Qur’an:<br>
	<br>
	</font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">None but Allah (Muhammad uses 
	another name, Rahman) protects during day and at night–<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/021.qmt.html">21:42</a>.<br>
	<br>
	Muhammad has no knowledge of Allah but he only gives warning plainly and 
	publicly; angels only bring Allah’s messages to him–<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/038.qmt.html">38:67-70</a>.<br>
	<br>
	Muhammad believed in all scriptures but he is commanded to judge between 
	other people's books; Muslims’ Allah and the Allah of the people of the 
	Books (the Jews and the Christians) are same...<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/042.qmt.html">42:15</a>.<br>
	<br>
	No Book was sent to the Pagans of Arabia to testify their claims of 
	ascribing partners to ar-Rahman–<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/043.qmt.html">43:21</a>.<br>
	</font></span><font size="2"><br>
	Then we read hadith.<br>
	<br>
	</font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">Muhammad considered himself to be 
	the messenger of ar-Rahman. The Meccans did not know of any ar-Rahman other 
	than the ar-Rahman of al-Yamamah. (ibn Sa’d, 1972, p. 1.189).<br>
	<br>
	The word 'ar-Rahm (womb)’ derives its name from ar-Rahman (i.e., one of the 
	names of Allah) and Allah said– (Sahih Bukhari,
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/073.sbt.html">
	8.73.17</a>,
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/073.sbt.html">
	18</a>).<br>
	</font></span><font size="2"><br>
	And, finally, comments from a few eminent writers:<br>
	<br>
	Was Muhammad, a warner, an admonisher or the messenger of Allah (Tabari. 
	1988, p. 6. xxxix)?<br>
	<br>
	The word “Allah” does not occur in the earliest passages of the Qur’an or 
	does so only rarely.The Jews and the Christians, when speaking about Allah 
	in Arabic, presumably used the word, “Allah” (Ibid, p. 6.33).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	<br>
	Regis Blanchere did the latest attempts of the chronological order of the 
	Qur’an in his French translation in 1949. In the first 17 suras, the word 
	Allah occurs only three times namely: (91:130, 10 (95:8), 16 (87:7). Instead 
	of Allah, we find “your Lord (rabbuka) in 96:13 or “we” in 94:14, The 
	Satanic verses indicate the confusion between Allah conceived 
	monotheistically and Allah as a “high Allah” (Ibid, p. 6.34).<br>
	</font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2"><br>
	</font></span><font size="2">Ar-Rab—the Lord, the Sustainer, the supreme. 
	3:44 (Allah) Allah is my Lord and your Lord. 18:14 Our Lord Rabb is the Lord 
	(Rabb) of the heavens and the earth; occupies the place of Hebrew Jehovah 
	(Hughes, 1994, p. 531).</font></font></p>
