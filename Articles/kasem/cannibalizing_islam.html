	ecent events in Iraq</span><span lang="EN-US"> and in some other Islamic 
	Paradises, like Darfur, Pakistan, Bangladesh, is unfolding a bizarre picture 
	of Islam—the picture of cannibalization of Islam! Bereft of any sensible 
	reasons, the Muslims are killing Muslims! How is this unthinkable 
	possible?—we might wonder in awe.&nbsp; After all, Islamic killing really means 
	wanton murder of the infidels, as had been amply demonstrated by 9/11, Bali, 
	Madrid, Jakarta, 7/7 and many other episodes of horrendous Islamic 
	genocides. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Having quenched, to some extent, its 
	thirst for infidel blood, it appears that Islam is now turning on itself. 
	After all, now-a-days, it is gradually becoming more difficult to murder 
	infidels in large number—as the <i>kafirs</i> have, slowly, but surely 
	become smarter, and have learnt their bitter lessons vis`-a vis` Islam. They 
	are now fully alert, cautious, stern and decisive in combating Islamic 
	terrorism. We no longer hear President George Bush exhorting, ‘Islam means 
	peace’, neither does Tony Blair say, ‘Islam is tolerant’. Instead, these <i>
	kafir</i> leaders are now loud and clear—saying without hesitation, ‘Islam 
	is an evil ideology’ used by the terrorists. These infidel lands are now 
	busy enacting tough legislations to call ‘spade a spade’. What we have been 
	writing for many years, is, finally being heeded by these infidels. This is 
	good for them, and is surely good for the entire humanity. But this is not 
	at all good news for Islam.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">You see, Islam cannot blissfully 
	thrive without red hot blood—the human blood. As a car cannot run without 
	petrol, so is Islam. The fuel that propels Islam is blood. When infidels’ 
	blood is difficult to shed, Islam spills its own blood. Blood is the 
	life-line of Islam, violence its hallmark, hate its foundation. Therefore, 
	when needed, Islam must cannibalize itself, just to run its own course, set 
	by Muhammad, the last Prophet. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This cannibalism is nothing new in 
	Islam. Islamic history is profusely replete with many such savage anecdotes 
	of cannibalization.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During the last few decades we have 
	witnessed much such Islamic cannibalism. The most recent event was the 
	Iran-Iraq war, in which millions of Muslims were killed, not by the infidels 
	(<i>kafirs</i>) but by Muslims. Undoubtedly, in not-too-distant a future, we 
	are bound to witness many such events of Islamic cannibalism.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here, I shall illustrate a few such 
	cases of Islamic cannibalism as was perpetrated during the nascent stages of 
	Islam, and ponder if we could learn few a few lessons from those gruesome 
	episodes.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The earliest example of Islamic 
	cannibalism, strangely, is found in the Holy Qur’an, in verses 9:108-110! 
	These verses refer to the gutting of a rival mosque on the instruction of 
	none but Muhammad (pbuh) when he was returning after his expedition to Tabuk, 
	a resorceful town in the Syrian-Byzantine territory. This Islamic incursion 
	story goes like this:&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<h1><span lang="EN-AU">The Destruction of an Opposition Mosque at Dhu Awan 
	by Muhammad--April, 631CE</span></h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Proceeding further from Tabuk on his 
	way to Medina, Muhammad halted at Dhu Awan at Quba (about 4 kms. from 
	Medina), an hour’s journey from Medina. There, an opposition Muslim group 
	had built a mosque. Previously, while Muhammad was making preparations for 
	the march to Tabuk, this group of Muslims approached him and said, “O 
	Messenger of God, we have built a mosque for the sick and needy and for 
	rainy and cold nights, and we would like you to visit us and pray for us.”
	</span><span lang="FR">(Tabari, vol.ix, p.61). </span><span lang="EN-AU">As 
	Muhammad was too busy with his preparations for Tabuk expedition, he excused 
	himself from visiting this newly-built mosque but assured the dissident 
	group that he would call on their mosque while returning to Medina (from 
	Tabuk).</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;When Muhammad halted at Dhu Awan, 
	he accused its builders of being unjust and sent a band of <i>jihadists</i> 
	to burn and destroy the freshly constructed mosque. He said to his band of 
	hooligans, “Go to this mosque whose owners are unjust people and destroy and 
	burn it.” </span><span lang="FR">(Tabari, vol.ix, p.61). </span>
	<span lang="EN-AU">His band of raging arsonists stealthily entered the 
	bustling mosque and set fire to it when it was filled with people assembled 
	for the evening prayer. The worshippers dispersed in utter terror. Allah 
	promptly sent down verse <b>9:107, 110,</b> justifying the destruction of 
	opposition mosques. To further validate his gutting of this mosque, Muhammad 
	concocted the story that he suspected that the builders of the ‘Mosque of 
	Dissent’ were planning to assassinate him.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Then he extolled the virtue of the 
	first mosque (known as <i>Masjid Takwa</i>) that was built by him at Quba 
	when he migrated to Medina and where he had asked his followers to pray<span style="color:#3366FF">.
	</span>This instruction is written in the Qur’an in verses <b>9:108-110</b></span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Here are those verses that had laid 
	the foundation of cannibalism in Islam:</span></p>
	<p><a name="009.107"><em><span lang="EN-AU">009.107</span></em></a><em><span lang="EN-AU">
	</span></em><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
	And there are those who put up a mosque by way of mischief and infidelity - 
	to disunite the Believers - and in preparation for one who warred against 
	Allah and His Messenger aforetime. They will indeed swear that their 
	intention is nothing but good; But Allah doth declare that they are 
	certainly liars. <br>
	<a name="009.108"><em>009.108</em></a><em> </em><br>
	Never stand thou forth therein. There is a mosque whose foundation was laid 
	from the first day on piety; it is more worthy of the standing forth (for 
	prayer) therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and Allah loveth 
	those who make themselves pure. <br>
	<a name="009.109"><em>009.109</em></a><em> </em><br>
	Which then is best? - he that layeth his foundation on piety to Allah and 
	His good pleasure? - or he that layeth his foundation on an undermined 
	sand-cliff ready to crumble to pieces? and it doth crumble to pieces with 
	him, into the fire of Hell. And Allah guideth not people that do wrong. <br>
	<a name="009.110"><em>009.110</em></a><em> </em><br>
	The foundation of those who so build is never free from suspicion and 
	shakiness in their hearts, until their hearts are cut to pieces. And Allah 
	is All-Knowing, Wise. <br>
	<br>
	These verses, when taken in true Islamic spirit, call for the devastation of 
	rival mosques. The most important question is: which mosques are genuinely 
	Islamic and which mosques are not so Islamic? Since there is no central 
	authority in Islam to decide on this, it naturally becomes a moot-point, to 
	say the least. It is therefore, a free-market in Islam when it comes to 
	destruction and bloodshed. Thus, Sunnis are free to destroy Shia mosques; 
	the Shias are permitted to destroy Sunni mosques; both these groups are free 
	to destroy Ahmedi or Kurdish mosques and so on. Within each group there are 
	sub-groups and they are also entitled to commit such depravities on other 
	groups. This is exactly what is going on in almost all Islamic Paradises. In 
	Iraq, Sunnis are destroying Shia mosques and murdering them. In Pakistan, 
	Sunnis are killing the Shias and burning their mosques. Then the Shias are 
	avenging this by destroying Sunni mosques. In Bangladesh, both the Sunnis 
	and the Shias are occupying Ahmedi mosques and setting them on fire. This 
	musical chair of mosque-burning and killing is proceeding unabated, each 
	groups claiming they are the true Muslims! Each group is adamant they are 
	absolutely following the Qur’an and <i>Sunna</i> (Muhammad’s deeds and 
	examples), the two principal sources of Islam.</span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-AU">Arguably, we might wonder why such mayhem must be 
	never-ending when the apologist Muslims, living in infidel lands 
	(especially, in the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia) are vociferous in 
	claiming ‘Islam is peaceful’ and Islam could never condone such murder and 
	violence. To solve this puzzle, we must, at first, find out the sect 
	structure of Islam. Simply stated, we must be aware of the various 
	sects/classes/denominations of Muslims.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">If we do a little <i>Googling</i> we 
	might discover the following main sects or branches of Islam:</span></p>

	<p><span lang="EN-AU">We already learned about the very first Islamic 
	cannibalism as mentioned in the Qur’an. Ever since then, the practice of 
	killing Muslims by Muslims is truly endemic. During the time of<i> Khulafa 
	Rashedin</i> (the rightly guided caliphs) this cannibalism took a serious 
	turn, sparing not even the two last caliphs, ‘Uthman and Ali. Both of them 
	were cruelly murdered by savage Islamic cannibals. Among these two cases of 
	Islamic cannibalism, perhaps the murder of ‘Uthman stands out to be the most 
	aghast. </span></p>
	<p><span lang="EN-AU">Here is how it was carried out, as described by Tabari 
	(volume xv):</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.5pt"><span lang="EN-US">After 
	the rebels laid siege on Uthman’s residence for 49 days (or 40 days, 
	according to another narration), they grew impatient. They had already set 
	ablaze the portico of his residence and had halted the supply of water. But 
	‘Uthman survived this peril—thanks to his secret guards. They sneaked in 
	water for ‘Uthman’s consumption. The dissidents became desperate to finish 
	‘Uthman. They hand-picked three experienced killers; dispatched them one 
	after another to assassinate ‘Uthman. Every time one of these professional 
	assassins entered ‘Uthman’s chamber, ‘Uthman adjured them for Allah’s sake 
	not to murder him—lest they too received Allah’s unbound wrath. Being really 
	fearful of this punishment of Allah, they could not strike their sword on an 
	aged emaciated ‘Uthman. One by one, they returned, having failed to 
	accomplish their mission. Frustrated, the rebels selected Muhammad b. Abu 
	Bakr (caliph Abu Bakr’s son), another cannibal, to murder ‘Uthman. Muhammad, 
	too found it extremely difficult to kill ‘Uthman, as’Uthman pleaded for his 
	life for Allah’s sake. So, Muhammad returned empty handed—without the blood 
	of ‘Uthman on his hands. </span></p>

	silver coin. When the fire was eventually extinguished, ibn al-Zubayr and

	[rebels] came in and attacked [‘Uthman]; one was striking him with iron tip 
	of his scabbard and another was beating him with his fists. A man with broad 
	iron-tipped arrows came and stabbed him in the threat, and the blood flowed 
	down on the Qur’an. Even as they did this they were afraid to kill him, but 
	he was old and lost consciousness. Still others came in, and when they saw 
	that he was unconscious they dragged him away by the leg. Na’ilah and her 
	daughters screamed. Al-Tujibi drew his sword to plunge it into [‘Uthman’s] 
	belly. Na’ilah shielded him, but [al-Tujibi] cut her hand, then he leaned on 
	[‘Uthman’s] chest with his sword. ‘Uthman—may God be pleased with him—was 
	murdered before sunset. Someone cried out, “How is it that his blood is

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;If you are troubled reading those

	of Muhammad (pbuh), the Hashim clan of the Quraysh. This example is the 
	epitome of true Islamic cannibalism.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The above Islamic cannibalism did 
	not end there. The cycle continued until Aisha (Prophet Muhammad’s dearest 
	wife), along with two of her brothers-in-laws, Talha and Zubayr set out to 
	avenge ‘Uthman’s murder. When she reached al-Basrah, a rebel stronghold, she 
	killed (by beheading) six hundred of the suspected rebels who ‘cannibalized’ 
	Uthman. Ali, being sucked into the vortex of this cannibalistic cycle, set 
	out to punish Aisha’s gang. The result: ten thousand Muslims, including 
	Talhah and Zubayr lay perished in al-Basrah, equal in proportion from both 
	sides. Aisha’s life was spared by the cannibals but her camel was hamstrung. 
	In Islamic history this is known as the Battle of the Camel. This is perhaps 
	one of the most moving examples of how ‘Islamic cannibalism’ really 
	perpetuates a never-ending cycle of violence and mayhem. This is the reason 
	why we shall, perhaps, never observe a let up to the succession of Islamic 
	cannibalism in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt or Sudan.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;The narration of this very 
	important chain of cannibalism will remain incomplete till we learn the fate 
	of all the participants sucked into this whirlpool of cannibalism and 
	counter cannibalism. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The following passages, adopted from 
	Tabari’s <i>Tarikh al-Tabari</i>&nbsp; (vol. xvii) illustrate, very briefly how 
	this cycle of Islamic cannibalism continued, and perhaps, continues even 
	today. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Muawiyah b. Abi Sufyan, the governor 
	of Syria and a close relative of caliph ‘Uthman demanded from Ali the 
	handing over of the killers of ‘Uthman. When Ali refused to comply with this 
	request, Muawayiah b. Abi Sufyan, and his right-hand man, ‘Amr b. al-‘As 
	(the deposed governor of Egypt), became open enemies of Ali. They gathered 
	forces and set off to attack Ali. Ali met this force at Siffin. Fearful of 
	defeat at the hands of Ali’s fierce and well-trained army, Muwayiah and ‘Amr 
	devised quite an innovative trick. Their soldiers attached copies of the 
	Qur’an at the tip of their lances and raised them high in air. Ali’s 
	soldiers went in stupor and were hesitant to charge their enemy, lest they 
	trample the Holy Qur’an. Both sides remained standstill—the battle became a 
	stalemate. In the end, both parties agreed to stop fighting and decided on a 
	speedy negotiated settlement by appointing an arbiter from each side. Having 
	mutually reached this agreement, both sides separated and returned. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;But not everyone on Ali’s side was 
	happy with Ali’s prompt decision. A faction of Islamist extremists thought 
	judgment belonged to Allah and Ali’s decision to appoint arbiters for a 
	peaceful settlement is contrary to Islamic principle. This dissident group 
	of Ali was known as the <i>Kharijites</i>. They insisted that Ali resume 
	fighting. But Ali could not renege on his treaty of a peaceful settlement. 
	The <i>Kharijites</i> declared Ali to be a sinner and asked him to repent. 
	Initial attempt by Ali for a reconciliation with the <i>Kharijites</i> met 
	with feeble success. So, ultimately, Ali had to cannibalize the cannibals. 
	He had to fight a major battle at the canal of Nahrawan, east of river 
	Tigris in Iraq. This battle ended with a merciless mass slaughter of the <i>
	Kharijites</i>. But this cannibalization did not completely eradicate the <i>
	Kharijite</i> problem. Many <i>Kharijites</i> survived this genocide, went 
	into hiding, and some of them returned to Kufa (Ali’s headquarter in Iraq) 
	stealthily. A few of them went to Egypt.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;Ali appointed Muhammad b. Abi Bakr, 
	the killer of ‘Uthman as the governor of Egypt, replacing the former 
	governor appointed by ‘Uthman. This appointment infuriated Muawiyah and 
	‘Amr. They plotted to assassinate Muhammad b. Abi Bakr and to replace him by 
	‘Amr b. al-‘As. On the instruction of Muawiyah b. Abi Sufyan, ‘Amr b. al-‘As 
	raised a battalion of 6,000 men and arrived at Egypt, ready to fight 
	Muhammad b. Abi Bakr. One of the commanders of this 6,000 strong army was 
	Muwayiah b. Hudhayj (no relation of Muawiyah b. Abi Sufyan) who lived in 
	Egypt. After surrounding Muhammad b. Abi Bakr’s forces, ‘Amr sent him the

	injustice and evil is great harm. Whoever sheds prohibited blood does not 
	escape retribution in this world or evil consequences in the next. We do not 
	know of anyone who was more persistent in injustice against ‘Uthman, more 
	shamefully wicked against him, or more fervent in opposing him than you. You 
	were among those who rushed against him in assault, and you were among those 
	who shed his blood. Then you thought that I would overlook or forget you to 
	the extent that you made yourself ruler (<i>amir</i>) over the land in which 
	you are a neighbor of mine, and majority of the people of which are my 
	supporters who share my views, heed what I say and call on me for help 
	against you. I have sent against you a band of men that is enraged against 
	you, seeks your blood to drink, and attempts to draw near to God by <i>jihad</i> 
	against you. They have given God an undertaking that they will make an 
	exemplary punishment of you, and if it were not that they intend for your 
	something more than merely killing you, I would not have warned you nor 
	given you notice. I would have liked them to kill you for your evil, your 
	breaking the bonds of relationship, and your enmity against ‘Uthman on the 
	day when he was pierced by your arrow heads between the bone that protrudes 
	behind the ear and his jugular vein. But it is abhorrent to me that I should 
	make an exemplary punishment of a Quraish, though God will never deliver you 
	from retaliation wherever you are. Salutations.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Muhammad b. Abi Bakr replied to

	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">p.155 (ibid)&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:57.5pt;margin-bottom:

	your letter in which you remind me of the matter of ‘Uthman, and I make no 
	apology to you regarding that. You tell me to withdraw from you, as if you 
	were a sincere advisor, and you try to frighten me with reference to an 
	exemplary punishment (<i>al-Muthlah</i>) as if you were sympathetic to me. I 
	hope that fortune will raise me up again over you and that I will sweep you 
	away in battle, but if you are given the victory and authority (<i>al-amr</i>) 
	in this world is yours, then, by my life, how many a Believer you will have 
	killed and mutilated (<i>mathlatum</i>). But both you and they must appear 
	before God, for all things return to Him, and “He is the most merciful of 
	the merciful and God’s help is to be implored against what you describe.” 
	Salutations.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Muhammad b. Abi Bakr lost the 
	battle, his army fled, and forlornly, he took shelter inside an abandoned 
	house. He was, completely exhausted, severely hungry, thirsty, and 
	hopelessly resigned to his fate. Soon, he was caught by Muawiyah b. 
	Hudhayj’s soldiers and was brought to Muawiyah b. Hudhayj’s presence. The 
	following conversation between Muhammad b. Abi Bakr and Muwawiyah b. Hudhayj 
	will demonstrate how savage those Islamist terrorists were:&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Here is the text of the conversation 
	as written on pp.157-158 (ibid):&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:57.5pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:54.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span lang="EN-US">Muhammad said 
	to them, “Give me some water to drink,” but Muawiyah b. Hudhayj answered 
	him, “May God not give him anything to drink if he ever gives you a drop. 
	You prevented ‘Uthman from drinking water until you killed him, while he was 
	fasting and in a state of ritual purity (<i>ihram</i>), and God received him 
	with choice sealed wine. By God I will kill you, ibn Abu Bakr, and God will 
	give you drink, boiling water and pus.”&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">And finally,&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:57.5pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:54.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span lang="EN-US">Muawiyah became 
	angry, had him brought forward, and killed him. Then he cast him into the 
	corpse of a donkey and set fire to it. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The chain of this Islamic 
	cannibalism will remain unfinished until we learn the fates of Ali, Muawiyah 
	b. Abi Sufyan and ‘Amr b. al-‘As.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As mentioned earlier, a few <i>
	kharijites</i> sneaked into Kufa and Egypt. Among them were the Islamist 
	terrorists, ibn Muljam, al-Burak b. Abdallah and ‘Amr b. Bakr. They took the 
	following vows: &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Ibn Muljam: to kill Ali (in Kufa)</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Al-Burak b. Abdallah: to kill 
	Muawiyah b. Abi Sufyan (in Syria)</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">‘Amr b. Bakr: to kill ‘Amr b. al-‘As 
	(in Egypt)</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;True to his promise, ibn Muljam 
	bought a menacing sword, sharpened and poisoned it a little over a month and 
	got ready to murder Ali. On the 17<sup>th</sup> day of Ramadan (the holiest 
	month in the Islamic calendar), very early Friday morning, he, accompanied 
	with another accomplice lay in darkness in the door of the mosque for the 
	arrival of Ali to lead the morning-prayer. When Ali approached the door of 
	the mosque, both the perpetrators stroke Ali with their swords. Ibn Mujlam’s 
	accomplice’s sword missed Ali; he fled in panic. But ibn Muljam’s sword hit 
	Ali right in his head. He was gravely injured, taken to his residence and on 
	the Saturday night he died of acute poisoning of the wound. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The people caught ibn Muljam on the 
	spot. He was calm, composed and expressed no remorse for what he had 
	done—everything was done Islamically. He did not break any Islamic rule—he 
	claimed. After Ali died, al-Hasan, Ali’s eldest son, beheaded him. Then the 
	people took ibn Muljam’s corpse, wrapped him in straw mats and burned him.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the same day Ali was struck down, 
	al-Burak b. Abdallah also attacked Muawiyah b. Abi Sufyan when he went to 
	the mosque to offer the morning-prayer. But his sword only cut the buttock 
	of Muwayiah. The sword was poisoned, so the doctor treated him with a 
	potion, the effect of which made Muawiyah infertile for life.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Al-Burak b. Abdallah was caught and 
	Muawiyah ordered him to be beheaded.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">As for ‘Amr b. al-‘As, he survived, 
	as he had stomach problem and could not lead the morning prayer. His 
	assailant, ‘Amr b. Bakr killed the acting imam, thinking him to be ‘Amr b. 
	al-‘As.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The killer ‘Amr b. Bakr was caught, 
	brought to ‘Amr b. al-‘As and was beheaded.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Please note that all those killing 
	missions were carried out almost simultaneously (those terrorists agreed to 
	conduct their mission in that manner—Tabari writes), at the same time This 
	is indeed strange, when we observe their uncanny resemblance of today’s 
	Islamist terrorists attack on infidels. They also conduct their murder 
	operations almost in chorus. Isn’t this the resurrection of the <i>Kharijits</i>? 
	&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Every time we switch on television 
	and watch those gory, despicable, horrific, gruesome and frightening scenes 
	in Iraq, Egypt, Sudan, Algeria, Darfur perpetrated by the Islamist <i>
	jihadists</i>, we are actually witnessing the playback of the past of 
	Islamic cannibalism. Every time we see those horrible scenes we are, in fact 
	watching re-enactment of the incidence of Uthaman’s murder and its 
	aftermath. Grasping this truth will enhance our perception of Islamic 
	terrorism, its depth, width and extent of savagery and why this barbarism is 
	not going to go away so soon. Do remember, the victims of these mayhems are 
	not infidels. They are truly Muslims, being cannibalized by truer Muslims. 
	One day we shall surely watch how these truer Muslims would be cannibalized 
	by the truest Muslims. It is just a matter of time before this cycle repeats 
	itself, if we were to learn any lessons from the episodes of Islamic 
	cannibalisms I illustrated from the earliest Islamic period. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<h1><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 18.0pt; color: blue">Conclusion:</span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Islamic cannibalism is a non-stop 
	musical chair which continues forever, or at least until Islam is 
	extinguished completely in the manner postulated by none other than Muhammad 
	(see above for the <i>ahadith</i>) himself. The concept of a single Islamic
	<i>Ummah</i> is simply a myth. When the killing of infidels becomes 
	difficult, Islam kills itself. Isn’t this a little piece of good news for 
	humanity? </span></p>
