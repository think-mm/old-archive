	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">HAT IS 
	THE ISLAMIC definition of oppression? Ask any Islamist this question and he 
	will certainly provide answers such as: Kashmir, Palestine, Afghanistan, 
	Iraq, Chechnya, Bosnia–.and so on. Think carefully, how true these 
	statements are. In fact, if one takes the trouble to read the blood-soaked 
	history of Islam, one could not help wondering why this label of oppression 
	not be imposed on Islam itself? The unprovoked, savage invasions by the 
	Bedouin Arabs, to subjugate, at the point of swords, the people of Iraq, 
	Persia, Syria, Egypt, Asia Minor, Armenia, Cyprus, Sicily, Crete, Spain, 
	Afriqiya (north Tunisia), India to their fascistic/Arab imperialism (peddled 
	as Islam) demonstrate a naked truth—that it was Islam who had started this 
	oppression.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Therefore, the charge that the Islamic mayhem in the current world is due to 
	what is happening (read oppression) in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and 
	Chechnya are just sham pretensions by the Islamists, the ideological gurus 
	of the Islamist terrorists and the suicide bombers. India, Bangladesh, 
	Pakistan, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkey, France, Denmark–have none of their 
	soldiers fighting in Iraq, yet these countries are not immune from the 
	Islamist terrorists’ attack. Did you ever wonder why?—why, not being 
	satisfied with the campaign of unremitting terror in the infidel 
	territories, the Islamist terrorists even have to terrorize the innocent 
	people of these Islamic Paradises. To find the answer to such a perplexing 
	issue please read on.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">One 
	fact stands out very clear from the hypocrisy of the Islamists. This fact 
	is: Islam is grossly offended/oppressed by any un-Islamic moves of the 
	infidels/not-so-good Muslims (like the Islamic Paradises I listed above). 
	This is simply because these Islamists audaciously believe that Islam is the 
	only religion in which each and every person on this planet must be 
	subjected to by hook or by crook—using terror, force and slaughter, if need 
	be. They have the Qur’an solidly backing them up. This is the major theme of 
	the Qur’an which is so eloquently supported by the cleric, quoted above.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">Here 
	are a few verses from the Holy Qur’an which are in 100% support of the above

	(infidels).</font></p>

	worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and dumb (unbelievers) 
	who do not understand Islam...8:22</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">How 
	about using (read sword) on those who refuse to convert to Islam or deviate 
	from Islam?&nbsp; After all, the Islamists are foaming: ‘Islam means peace’, 
	‘there is no compulsion in religion’ ‘killing one person is killing the 
	entire mankind’, and so on. Because of such misleading propaganda by the 
	Islamists and their bogies of western apologists of Islam, one might find it 
	impossible to believe that there could be anything in the Qur’an but 
	‘peace’, ‘love’ and ‘mercy’ for the infidels. Sadly, to the disappointment 
	of these gullible unbelievers, the Qur’an, in many verses, categorically 
	exhorts the true believers to use force preemptively to convert the 
	unbelievers to Islam. Here is a sample verse:</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBlockText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Allah sent down iron as a material for war and for other benefits; whoever 
	deviates from Islam is to be brought back with iron (i.e. with force, 
	meaning use iron (sword) to force people to Allah’s religion)...57:25</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">And 
	when all efforts to pursue the <i>Kafirs</i> to convert to Islam have 
	failed, or when the unbelievers resort to rejecting Islam openly, Islam 
	stipulates that they be crucified or maimed. Read this terrible verse from 
	Allah:</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBlockText" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Punishment for waging war against Allah (i.e. the unbelievers who reject 
	Islam) and His messenger is execution (beheading) or crucifixion or cutting 
	off of hands and feet from opposite sides or exile from the land...5:33</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">One 
	might still insist that the above verse is applicable only in war 
	situations, when Islam and its founder, Muhammad (or Muslims) are/were 
	attacked in a physical fight. Perish this thought, if you want to learn 
	about ‘real Islam’. The words, ‘waging war’, in the above verse has very 
	little to do with real combat (like Iraq, Afghanistan). Any action, 
	activity, remark, gesture, word/s, sound, utterance, look, manner, habit, 
	conduct, style and so on, which are not in conformity with Islamic percepts 
	are considered as blasphemous or ‘waging war’. Thus, even the slightest 
	criticism of Islam, Muhammad, Qur’an or <i>Sharia</i>, verbally or in 
	writing, might be treated as gross violations of Islamic tenets. These acts 
	are absolutely blasphemous, and are punishable by death (by beheading, the 
	Islamic method of slaughter). The conclusive proof of this dreadful 
	provision is the blasphemy laws enacted by most of the Islamic Paradises. 
	This is the meaning of freedom of thought in Islam—the freedom to mete out 
	capital punishment to those who dare to criticize Islam, in any manner 
	whatsoever. If anyone still has any suspicion of what I just wrote, let him 
	consult the blasphemy law of any Islamic state, which complies 
	one-hundred-percent with the Qur’anic verse I quoted above.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">Below, 
	I have listed a few innocuous activities, manners, social customs, 
	traditions and the daily way of life, which the <i>Kafirs</i> blithely take 
	for granted but which are extremely un-Islamic. According to Islamic morals, 
	customs and laws, these offensive activities/practices might be construed as 
	oppressive to Islam and, therefore, they are legitimate targets for 
	eradication, or they must be replaced by Islamic practices or Islamic 
	purification. The very small number of Islamists currently occupying (the 
	Islamists think that Allah has sent them to infidel lands to conquer it) the 
	infidel lands (camouflaged as economic migrants or political asylum seekers 
	or refugees) will fight tooth-and-nail, legally or politically, covertly or 
	overtly to remove such un-Islamic practices from the infidel lands which 
	they have occupied (migrated for Islamic occupation). They would, when 
	possible, lobby the simple and fair-minded <i>Kafir</i> politicians to enact 
	Islamic laws as a replacement for those infidel customs, traditions and 
	values. In their language, this process of Islamisation by stealth is called 
	‘elimination of vices and promotion of virtues’—a secret method of imposing 
	Islamic imperialism.</font></p>

	</ul>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">If you 
	have time to spend, I am certain you could find many other actions and 
	traditions of the infidels which are grossly offensive to the Muslims, and, 
	therefore, oppressive to Islam. Many of those examples cited above were from 
	my own experience—from real world. So be prepared to witness many such 
	examples in your land as well.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	above list is just a sample example of the extent to which the Islamists are 
	prepared to go to launch their agenda of globalization of Islamic 
	imperialism, which is basically Arab/Bedouin imperialism. Why should we 
	consider Islam as Arab/Bedouin imperialism? Here is the answer.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">You 
	see, the ultimate goal of the Islamists is the creation of a Pan Islamic 
	world, which must be ruled by a caliph (the Islamists call it the <i>
	Khilafat</i> movement) who will be responsible to enforce Islamic laws (<i>Sharia</i>) 
	globally. So, what are the requirements to be a caliph?—you might ask. 
	According to Islamic law, (ref: Reliance of the Traveler, published by Amana 
	Publications, Bettsville, Maryland, 1999, pp.640-642, law number o25.3) the 
	mandatory qualifications of an Islamic caliph are: <b>1. must be a Muslim 2. 
	must be a male 3. must be from the Quraysh tribe of the Arabs 4. must be a 
	freeman (i.e., not a slave) 5. must be of sound mind.</b> This provision of 
	Islamic law means that the world (the Pan Islamic world) must be ruled by an 
	Arab (from the Quraysh stock, probably from Saudi Arabia or Jordan) and no 
	one else. This also means that George Bush, Tony Blair, Jacque Chirac, 
	Vladimir Putin, the Chinese Prime Minister, the Japanese Prime Minister–.the 
	most powerful infidel leaders in the world and the not so powerful infidel 
	leaders must convert to Islam, declare their allegiance to the new 
	Arab/Quraysh caliph and become this Arab caliph’s governors. If they do not 
	comply with such Islamic demand then they must be removed by terror, 
	intimidation and force. Please stop laughing! I hope by this time you 
	clearly comprehend the reason of the Islamists terrorists of what they are 
	doing around the globe. The Islamists are absolutely serious in their 
	goal—the Islamic caliphate, and to assist them there is no shortage of Arab 
	charity money to finance their strategy and operations. This is the reason 
	why the Islamists, the Islamist terrorists, the Jihadists and the Islamist 
	apologists have no shortage of fund—the Arab/oil money is aplenty to finance 
	the establishment of a super Arab (Islamic) kingdom. This is what I mean by 
	Arab Imperialism when I say that ‘Islam is Arab/Bedouin imperialism’.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Terrified, threatened and in panic, the unbelievers might want to know when 
	this Islamic madness might end. I am afraid there is bad news for them. The 
	war against the infidel world is a perpetual war. Islam divides the entire 
	world/humanity into two—the world of Islam (<i>Dar al-Islam</i>) and the 
	world of warfare (<i>Dar al-Harb</i>). These two worlds are in permanent 
	confrontation, until Islam replaces the current civilization with its own 
	version, the Islamic Caliphate. This is what Samuel Huntington had ominously 
	postulated in his classic work, <i>The Clash of Civilizations.</i> This 
	inevitable clash is now on us, make no mistake on this.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">Here 
	are two verses from the Qur’an which clearly divide the civilization into 
	two categories: Islamic and un-Islamic, and the declaration of a perpetual 
	war against the infidels.</font></p>

	Conclusion:</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">As 
	exemplified from the most authentic source of Islam (Qur’an), Islam, truly 
	is intolerant to any idea/faith which does not endorse it as the only 
	religion for mankind. Once we understand this fascistic and imperialistic 
	nature of Islam, the fight against the Islamist terrorism becomes quite 
	simple and straightforward. It (the Islamic terrorism) is not at all a 
	political one—it is an ideological war—truly, the collision of culture and 
	civilization. But, in contrast to the battle among various civilizations, as 
	hypothesized by Samuel Huntington, this clash is between two worlds—the word 
	of Islam and the world of <i>Kufr</i> or unbelief. Let the PC politicians 
	pay heed to what the cleric above had said. He is 100% Muslim and 0% 
	politician/hypocrite.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	current world is about to be divided into two camps—the camp of Islam and 
	the camp of infidels, without any third-world between them. Thus, having 
	almost been polarized, a final showdown is gradually shaping up between 
	these two camps. It is just a matter of time when this showdown will result 
	in a massive loss of human lives—both Muslims and non-Muslims, unless 
	correct steps are taken to diffuse this cataclysmic time-bomb. Read the 
	Qur’an and the <i>Hadis</i>, to learn who will win this showdown, if the 
	showdown does really take place. You might be greatly surprised, if you were 
	to believe these Islamic scriptures.</font></p>
