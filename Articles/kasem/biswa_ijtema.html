  Ijtema venue on the bank of Turag River near Tongi, Bangladesh</font></b></center>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">I wrote this short essay because I read in
  today’s newspaper from Bangladesh that Biswa Ijtema or World Congregation
  will start from Friday Dec 13 and will continue until Sunday Dec 15, 2002.
  This hosting of marathon preaching session has a colorful history going back
  to 1950s.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">During our University days, we had a few
  friends who always used to pester us for praying, fasting, <i>Qur’an Tilawat</i>,
  going for <i>Jumma </i>prayer, and all other Islamic rituals to cleanse our
  souls.&nbsp; Whenever we used to see them coming to our rooms to distribute
  their ‘<i>Hedayat</i>’ and ‘<i>Bayan</i>’ to us, we used to slip away
  from our rooms just to avoid them.&nbsp; However, they were very clever to
  catch many of us when we were on the walk or even when we were on our way to
  communal shower or even to toilets.&nbsp; Such a vicious pest they were!</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">Who were they?&nbsp; Yes, they were none
  but the <b>Tabligh-e-Jamaat</b> adherents.&nbsp; Their headquarters was the
  Kakrail mosque, just adjacent to the famous Ramna Green (i.e., Ramna Park).&nbsp;
  Then this mosque was still under construction.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it became
  the nerve center for these diehard Islamists.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">What did they want from us?&nbsp; It was
  anyone’s guess why were they such persistent Islamic zealots.&nbsp; What
  motivated them?&nbsp; We simply had no clue.&nbsp; However, because they were
  sort of religious preacher/s we dare not confront them intellectually neither
  we would treat them with disrespect.&nbsp; We simply tried to avoid them as
  much as possible.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">That was the biggest mistake of our
  generation.&nbsp; When the freedom fighting came around in 1971, we found them
  to be on the side of the Pakistanis and were not at all ashamed to say that
  Bengalis were not true Muslims and that we deserved Allah’s punishment.&nbsp;
  Had we confronted them those days we could have nipped their secret agenda in
  the bud.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">Today, this Tablig-e-Jamaat has become a
  huge multi-headed Hydra.&nbsp; Many will say that they are innocent and pious
  Muslims preaching only the tolerant/moderate Islam; therefore, we should not
  be so alarmed at their growth.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">This is a very simplistic view of this
  movement.&nbsp; Make no mistake that the Tablig has the same agenda as any
  other Islamic Party in Bangladesh, that is, to establish an Islamic Paradise
  in Bangladesh.&nbsp; The only difference is that their methodology is much
  more subliminal, insidious, cunning and shrewd.&nbsp; They are bent upon
  totally changing the mindset of the Bangalees to 100% Islamic zeal.&nbsp;
  During our youthful days, the movement was completely a matter of this Tabligh
  party only.&nbsp; No Government of any color ever lent any support or provided
  encouragement to them.&nbsp; However, slowly, they had been able to change all
  this.&nbsp; It is now a multimillion-dollar religious business funded by the
  petro-dollar of the Middle East and now supported by most political parties in
  Bangladesh including the so-called secularist parties like AL and BNP.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook"><b>Now consider the following:</b></font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">1. Ijtema had been going on since early
  1950s in Kakrail Mosque funded by the Saudi Government.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">2. The venue was shifted to Tongi in mid
  1960s (1965 or 1966) because of its popularity.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">3. Two army despots popularized it to the
  point that more than 2 million (all estimate, no real head count) devotees
  attend it every year.&nbsp; If the head count is correct, then, this is the <i>Numero
  Uno</i> (Number One) Islamic congregation bypassing the Hajj ceremony.&nbsp;
  Still then, Dhaka's myriad newspapers call it number two congregation only
  after Hajj.&nbsp; These newspaper editors are too worried that if they bill
  Ijtema as number one gathering, then the sanctity of Hajj will be diminished
  and they can't let that happen.&nbsp; Therefore, they have to fib and there is
  nothing wrong in fibbing, huh?</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">4.&nbsp; The government and private
  business shut down during those 3 days making Bangladesh non-competitive in
  this age of globalization.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">5.&nbsp; Marathon preaching session goes on
  for 3 days brainwashing the people to work for <i>Akheraat</i> (next world)
  but not for this world.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">6. They have separate tents for foreigners,
  big bureaucrats, businessmen, and even for army high officials.&nbsp;
  Therefore, forget this concept of egalitarianism (<i>Shammobaad</i>).&nbsp;
  This is all in the Holy Book only. No reflection of this ever shows up in the
  Ijtema ground near Turag River.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">7. Through the <i>Tafsir-al-Qur'an</i>, <i>Bayan</i>,
  <i>Waz</i>, etc., they are making Bangladesh a backward nation.&nbsp; The
  Mullah’s preaching is anti women.&nbsp; Thus, if 50% of Bangladesh people
  are maligned by the dictums of these preachers, then why do we need this
  congregation?</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">Many may still argue that there is nothing
  wrong in preaching the peaceful Islam through Tabligh Jamaat.&nbsp; If we
  accept this childish view, then we may even say what is wrong with the 60,000
  or so madrassahs that have mushroomed in recent times in Bangladesh with the
  help of petro-dollars.&nbsp; Well, we are now reaping the bitter harvest from
  these religious seminaries, the harvest being the mindless
  terror/killing/bombing/ethnic cleansing and whatnot.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">Therefore, we can notice a clear,
  straightforward relationship between more peaceful Islam preaching and more
  terror activities.&nbsp; The more petro-dollar, the more Islam, the more
  Tabligh, the more bombing, the more destruction and the more ethnic cleansing.&nbsp;
  A vicious cycle has been established and there is very little clue how an
  impoverished nation like Bangladesh can get out of this vicious cycle.</font>
  <p><font face="Century Schoolbook">In conclusion, I say: we must stop this
  show of piety.&nbsp; Islam should be reduced to <i>Kalima</i>, <i>Namaz</i>, <i>Roza</i>,
  <i>Hajj</i>, <i>Zakat</i>, <i>Toupi</i> (only the round one!), <i>Zainamaj</i>,
  <i>Tasbih</i>, <i>Alkhalla</i>, beard, <i>Pagri </i>(Turban), <i>Surma</i>, <i>Attor&nbsp;</i>
  (fragrance) etc., at personal level.&nbsp; No public gathering should be
  allowed.&nbsp; Enough damaged has already been done in the name of Islam.&nbsp;
  Let us make Bangladesh society more pragmatic and in tune with this modern
  world rather than the Akherat.&nbsp; If one takes the Akherat part seriously,
  then the charm of Islam falls flat.&nbsp; The Mullahs attending the Ijtema
  won't let that happen.&nbsp; They will endlessly emphasize the <i>Akheraat </i>over
  this mortal world.&nbsp; That’s a sure thing.</font><br>
