	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">Further 
	information on this lustful marriage with a 19-year-old Jewish beauty with 
	60-year-old Muhammad is glimpsed from the narration of Ibn Sa'd. Please note 
	that before falling into the hands of Muhammad, this pretty lass was married 
	to a Jewish man. Muhammad had already killed Safiyaah's husband and her 
	father after subjecting them to brutal torture, and finally beheading them. 
	Having satiated his lust for blood, on the same night he killed her closest 
	relatives, Muhammad took Saffiyah into his tent to have sex with her.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We learn from Ibn Sa'd that Muhammad 
	purchased Safiyyah from Dhiyah for seven camels (around US$ 2,100). On the 
	same night that Muhammad took possession of Safiyyah, he hastened to his 
	tent to sleep with her. Here is what Ibn Sa'd writes:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;“….when it was night, he entered a 
	tent and she entered with him. Abu Ayyub came there and passed the nigh by 
	the tent by the tent with a sword keeping his head at the tent. When it was 
	morning and the Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, perceived (some body) 
	moving, he asked: Who is there? He replied: I am Abu Ayub. He asked: Why are 
	you here? He replied: O Apostle of Allah! There is a young lass newly wedded 
	(to you) with whose late husband you have done what you have done. I was not 
	sure of safety, so I wanted to be close to you. Thereupon the Apostle of 
	Allah, may Allah bless him, said twice: O Abu Ayyub! May Allah show you 
	mercy.” &nbsp;(ibn Sa'd vol.ii, p.145)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">To hide the 
	lascivious character of Muhammad, Muslim biographers often mention that he 
	married Safiyyah before he slept with her. But they forget to state that 
	Muhammad did not follow the rule of waiting period (three monthly periods) 
	to sleep with Safiyyah.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">We shall now see 
	how Muhammad had violated the rule of <em>idda</em> (waiting period) in 
	marrying a woman. These rules are stipulated in the Qur'an thus:</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">Before marrying 
	another man divorced women must wait three monthly periods...2:228</span></font></p>

	</em></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
	<strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves 
	for three monthly periods. Nor is it lawful for them to hide what Allah Hath 
	created in their wombs, if they have faith in Allah and the Last Day. And 
	their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if 
	they wish for reconciliation. And women shall have rights similar to the 
	rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree 
	(of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise&nbsp;</span></font></p>

	do. </span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">Clearly, when 
	Muhammad wanted to sleep or to have sex with Safiyyah, she was a widow, 
	technically, as Muhammad had already killed her husband. Therefore, as per 
	the Qur'an, Muhammad had to wait at least four months and ten days before he 
	could even touch her. But Muhammad did not at all observe this rule; 
	instead, he took Safiyyah, straight from the battlefield to his bed in the 
	war camp. Having spent the night with her, Muhammad took her to another, 
	safer location, stayed there for three days and consummated his marriage 
	with Safiyyah.</span></font></p>

	stopped to rest. I heard him saying repeatedly, &quot;O Allah! I seek refuge with 
	You from distress and sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from 
	miserliness and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being 
	overcome by men.&quot; Then we reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to 
	conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab 
	was described to him. Her husband had been killed while she was a bride. So 
	Allah's Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with him till we 
	reached a place called Sad-AsSahba,' where her menses were over and he took 
	her for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served on a small leather 
	sheet. Then Allah's Apostle told me to call those who were around me. So, 
	that was the marriage banquet of Allah's Apostle and Safiya. Then we left 
	for Medina. I saw Allah's Apostle folding a cloak round the hump of the 
	camel so as to make a wide space for Safiya (to sit on behind him) He sat 
	beside his camel letting his knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to 
	mount the camel. Then, we proceeded till we approached Medina; he looked at 
	Uhud (mountain) and said, &quot;This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by 
	us.&quot; Then he looked at Medina and said, &quot;O Allah! I make the area between 
	its (i.e. Medina's) two mountains a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a 
	sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (i.e. the people of Medina) in their Mudd and 
	Sa (i.e. measures).&quot;<br>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first such woman was none but 
	his first cousin-sister, Umm Hani bt Abu Talib. Muhammad passionately fell 
	in love with her, but for some unknown reason his beloved uncle, Abu Talib 
	did not give her hand to Muhammad when Muhammad requested. Instead, she was 
	married to a pagan, Hibayrah. But Muhammad's adulterous relation with Umm 
	Hani (real name Fakitah, also known as Hind) continued. He used to sleep in 
	her house, when no one was around. Such an incidence took place when 
	Muhammad returned from his failed mission at Taif, after the deaths of his 
	first wife, Khadijah and his uncle Abu Talib. Returning from Taif, he took 
	shelter in Ka'ba. But at nightfall, when all were asleep, he stealthily went 
	to Umm Hani's house and spent the night with her. When the people did not 
	find him at Ka'ba, they went looking for him and when he was discovered in 
	the house of Umm Hani, he was embarrassed, so was Umm Hani. To hide the 
	truth, he concocted the story of his night journey to Jerusalem and Paradise 
	from Umm Hani's house (more precisely, from her bed), which many converted 
	Muslims found too incredible to believe and left Islam. This made him sad 
	and withdrawn. Soon, after such an adulterous affair was leaked out, he left 
	Mecca and settled in Medina. But his undying love for Umm Hani remained 
	aflame.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Later, when Muhammad became 
	militarily strong and conquered Mecca, he went to Umm Hani's house and 
	stayed there overnight, praying and chit-chatting with her. Hubayrah, Umm 
	Hani's husband had foreseen the fall of Mecca and had fled to Najran. So, 
	Umm Hani was living in her house, separated from her pagan husband, and 
	Muhammad was there comforting her, in open transgression of the Qur'anic 
	code. (Please consult: Martin Lings, p.33, 101, 103-104, 299; Ibn Ishaq,

	The Jauniyya (a lady from Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house 
	in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An-Nu'man bin Sharahil, and 
	her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet entered upon her, he said to 
	her, &quot;Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift.&quot; She said, &quot;Can a princess 
	give herself in marriage to an ordinary man?&quot; The Prophet raised his hand to 
	pat her so that she might become tranquil. She said, &quot;I seek refuge with 
	Allah from you.&quot; He said, &quot;You have sought refuge with One Who gives refuge. 
	Then the Prophet came out to us and said, &quot;O Abu Usaid! Give her two white 
	linen dresses to wear and let her go back to her family.&quot; Narrated Sahl and 
	Abu Usaid: The Prophet married Umaima bint Sharahil, and when she was 
	brought to him, he stretched his hand towards her. It seemed that she 
	disliked that, whereupon the Prophet ordered Abu Usaid to prepare her and to 
	provide her with two white linen dresses. (See Hadith No. 541). <br>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">A pilgrim must 
	not marry and give someone in marriage in the sacred state (while wearing
	<em>ihram</em>)…(Sunaan Abu Dawud, 2.10.1837)</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><em>Sunaan Abu Dawud: vol.ii, Book 
	10, Number 1837</em></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nubaih b. Wahb, brother of Banu ‘Abd 
	al-Dar said: ‘Umar b. ‘Ubaid Allah sent someone to Aban b. ‘Uthman b. 
	‘Affan, asking him (to participate in the marriage ceremony). Aban in those 
	days was the chief of pilgrims, and both were in the sacred state (wearing
	<em>ihram</em>). I want to give the daughter of Shaibah b. Jubair to Talhah 
	b. ‘Umar in marriage. I wish that you may attend it. Aban refused and said: 
	I heard my father ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan narrating a tradition from the Apostle 
	of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: A pilgrim may not marry and give 
	someone in marriage in the sacred state (while wearing ihram).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But Muhammad did not have much 
	regard for the Qur'an or even to his own words when it came to marrying 
	women and having sex with them. So, when he went to Mecca, to perform the 
	Hajj, and a proposal of marriage was offered to him, he quickly accepted the 
	offer and married the woman even though he was in sacred state wearing <em>
	irham</em>.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is the <em>hadis</em> from 
	Sunaan Abu Dawud:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">Muhammad married 
	Maimunah while he was in the sacred state wearing <em>ihram</em>…(Sunaan Abu 
	Dawud, 2.10.1840) </span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><em>Sunaan Abu Dawud: vol.ii, Book 
	10, Number 1840</em>:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Prophet (may 
	peace be upon him) married Maimunah while he was in the sacred state 
	(wearing <em>ihram</em>).</font></p>

	Conclusion:</font></span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am certain the Islamist apologists 
	will employ many twisted tricks, convoluted logic and strange reasoning to 
	disprove all those historical records which I enumerated above.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fact is, no matter what they 
	say, the truth remains—the intelligent readers will have no difficulty in 
	separating the corn from the chaff. Muhammad, had on many occasions did 
	violate the Qur'an.</font></p>
