	<span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The reason why Muhammad had 
	to resort this marvellous trick to entice people to Islam is not difficult 
	to fathom. This sura is an early Meccan sura, the time when Muhammad was 
	very weak and just had about a score or so followers. The majority pagan 
	Quraysh, when asked Muhammad to describe his Allah, he failed. It was 
	because the pagans already had a version of Allah of their own (more on this 
	in a separate part). They could not accept Muhammad’s description of Allah. 
	Angry and frustrated, Muhammad simply rebuked the pagans for not accepting 
	his Allah and he resorted to cursing them with the denial of Allah’s 
	blessings. Please note in the previous section, we noted that Allah will 
	show His Shin to the infidels. One might wonder why Allah has to hide His 
	Face to the unbelievers when they could easily view Allah’s naked Shin. This 
	is, yet another enigma of the Qur’an. &nbsp;</font></span></p>

	a fire, spoke with Moses (27:9). On a spoken command from Allah, Moses’ 
	stick turned into a snake. Frightened, Moses turned tail; but Allah called 
	back Moses (27:9–10, 28:31). How was it possible for Moses to hear Allah’s 
	voice if Allah did not use the same language as a human would to communicate 
	verbally with Moses? If this is not convincing enough, there is more 
	surprises. The holy Qur’an says that a fearful Moses heard a voice from a 
	tree: it was Allah. Allah called Moses in His own voice. No angel or jinn 
	was there to convey Allah’s messages to Moses. Allah Himself spoke with 
	Moses (28:30). On another occasion, the holy Qur’an maintains, that Allah
