    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">This article delves
    into the very authorship of the Holy Qur’an—a new way of looking at the
    Holy Qur’an. An enquiry is made using logical reasoning and historical
    references on the authorship of the Qur’an. Thus this methodology is
    totally opposed to the blind believers who accept the authenticity of the
    Qur’an unquestionably. By analysing, dissecting and carefully interpreting
    the contents of the Qur’an, the <i>Ahadith</i>, Sirah (Muhammad’s
    biography) the author has identified several parties who had undoubtedly
    contributed to the composition of the Qur’anic verses. It was not Allah
    who wrote the Qur’an; it was not even Muhammad alone who did this either.
    The Qur’an is not the creation of a single entity or a single person.
    There were several parties involved in the composition, scribing, amending,
    inserting and deleting the Qur’anic verses. The most important
    personalities involved in the creation of the Qur’an were: Imrul Qays,
    Zayd b. Amr, Hasan b. Thabit, Salman, Bahira, ibn Qumta, Waraqa and Ubayy b.
    Ka’b. Muhammad himself was involved in the make-up of a limited number of
    verses, but the most influential person who motivated Muhammad in the
    invention of Islam and the opus of the Qur’an was, perhaps, Zayd b. Amr,
    who preached ‘Hanifism’. Muhammad later metamorphosed Zayd’s
    ‘Hanifism’ into Islam. Therefore, the assertion that Islam is not a new
    religion stands to be true. However, the important finding is that the
    Qur’an is definitely not the words of Allah—it is a human-made scripture
    which Muhammad simply passed up as Allah’s final words to mankind. Another
    important aspect of this essay is that among the ancient religions that the
    writers of the Qur’an incorporated in it, perhaps the practices of the
    Sabeans is crucial. In fact, the rituals of 5 prayers and the 30 days
    fasting were actually adapted from the Sabeans. Qur’an, thus, is a
    compilation of various religious books that existed during Muhammad’s
    time. Muhammad, not Allah, simply adopted, picked and chose from various
    sources and created the Qur’an. While many parties contributed to the
    Qur’an, Muhammad became its chief editor—to say it plainly.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><span lang="EN-AU" style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Introduction</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">According to Islam,
    questioning the Allah’s absolute authorship of the Qur’an is a serious
    blasphemy. A person may face death sentence simply for nurturing an atom of
    doubt on Qur’an’s authenticity. The Qur’an is above all. Nothing in
    the creation of Allah is holier than the Qur’an. However, human being what
    he is—ever inquisitive—I started doubting Qur’an’s authorship in my
    very childhood--when I was introduced in the recitation of this Holy
    Scripture in a very formal manner. I spent a couple of years learning a few
    introductory verses under the tutorship of a local ‘Hujur’ (Islamic
    religion teacher) in the local mosque. This ‘Hujur’ taught the Qur’an
    to a group of us by holding a rattan cane that looked quite shiny as he used
    to oil the cane every day before his ‘Murid’ (learners) arrived in the
    mosque. I can vouch that none of us ever liked to study the Qur’an—it
    was the most boring and the most painful task during our childhood. We
    simply memorised like parrots, certain verses without understanding a single
    word of them The ‘Hujur’ also did not know the meanings of those verses.
    Whenever we asked any question about any verse, the answer was a few stroke
    of the cane from the ‘Hujur’. The learning of the recitation of the
    Qur’an became associated with corporeal punishment and child-abuse. Thus,
    we developed a deep disdain towards the Qur’an recitation in particular a
    dislike for the Mullahs in general.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">Later, after I left
    my University and started working, a colleague of mine presented me with a
    copy of the translation of the Holy Qur’an by Abdullah Yusuf Ali. My
    colleague was a diehard ‘Tabligi’ (a religious proselytiser) and
    exhorted me to read the translation carefully. He vouched that after I had
    comprehended the true messages of the Holy Scripture my life will change for
    ever—for the better, he insisted. Reluctantly, I started to read the
    English translation—verse by verse, passage by passage. The more I read,
    the more I was shocked, disturbed, astonished, bewildered and resentful. I
    could not believe that a book which is supposed to be the handiwork of the
    most compassionate, the most merciful and the most forgiving Allah could
    contain such a terrible amount of hate, terror, call for murder, war,
    vengeance and most of all a blanket plea for the destruction of all those
    who do not subscribe to the Qur’anic view of the world. Of course, there
    were a few verses which were very poetical, beautifully crafted, rhythmic
    and sometimes rich in spirituality. Apart from those handful ‘good’
    stuff I found the vast part of the Qur’an simply nonsensical, and
    not-to-talk about the those incriminating verses exhorting the believers to
    murder and wage an unrelenting war (<i>Jihad</i>) against the unbelievers. I
    started questioning: how could a merciful, compassionate Allah write such a
    cranky book that is nothing more than a trash and a manual of terror, war
    and plunder? When my ‘Tabligi’ colleague asked how I was doing with the
    Qur’an, I simply told him I was doing fine—elaborating further that I
    discovered plenty of new astonishing materials in the Qur’an which I never
    thought existed in it. He simply smiled and said, “The Qur’an is
    wonderful, isn’t it?” I replied, “You said it!”</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;A few years
    later, I started to ponder deeply on the Qur’an. Using the works of other
    translators, as well as the <i>Tafsirs</i> (explanation), I read and re-read
    the Holy Scripture--several times to make sure that what they translated and
    explained were absolutely correct. The more I learned about the Qur’an the
    more I became distraught, disturbed and angry—angry because I felt that I
    was utterly let down by a killer religion which was imposed on me due to my
    birth. The stuff I read in the Qur’an jolted me so much that I wanted to
    find the answer to my perennial question—who really authored the Qur’an?
    It took me a long time and many years of painstaking work to arrive at the
    answer of that question. This article tries to answer that question. I had
    been planning this essay for a long time, and now, after writing it I feel
    it is for you to ponder too—‘Who authored the Qur’an?’</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">During my
    investigative phase I found that a lot of people were involved in the
    compilation and the construction of the Qur’an. Unknown to the vast
    majority of Muslims, and buried deep inside the Qur’an, <i>Ahadith</i> and
    Sirah there are copious evidence to reject, out of hand, the contention that
    the Qur’an is the creation of Allah. Making Allah the author of the Quran,
    I think, is the prime lie perpetrated on mankind for more than a millennium.
    We can, with certainty, say that it was not even Muhammad alone who authored
    the Qur’an.In fact, the major part of the Qur’an was actually either
    composed by or inspired and written by a few other individuals. Most notable
    among them were:</span></p>

    Pagan origin of Muhammad</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">It is an absolute
    fact that Muhammad was born of pagan parents. His father, Abdullah and his
    mother, Amina were both pagans and they used to worship many idols. His
    entire childhood (probably up to his teen) was spent in paganism. To day,
    many Muslims will find it extremely hard to digest this fact. However,
    Muhammad’s pagan origin is disclosed by Hisham ibn al-Kalbi. On page 17 of
    his important work, <i>Kitab al-Asnam </i>&nbsp;(The Book of Idols) he
    writes (Hisham al-Kalbi, <i>Kitab al-Asnam</i>, p.17):</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align="justify">‘We have
    been told that the Apostle of God once mentioned al-Uzza saying, “I have
    offered a white sheep to al-‘Uzza, while I was a follower of the religion
    of my people.” ‘</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">In the statement above Muhammad clearly
    admits his past adherence to paganism—the then religion of the Quraysh.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Initially, Muhammad even eulogized the
    important gods (or idols) of the pagans by agreeing with the Quraysh—at
    some point that these gods were the intercessors of Allah. On the same page
    Hisham ibn al-Kalbi writes:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The Quraysh were wont to circumambulate
    the Ka’bah and say:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">These were also called “the Daughters
    of Allah,” and were supposed to intercede before God. When the Apostle of
    God was sent god revealed unto him [concerning them] the following:</p>

    <br>
    &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">When Muhammad became an adult and
    started to attend the annual assembly of poets at Ukaz he was deeply
    impressed and moved by the thoughts, eloquence, sentiment, freethinking and
    humanism expounded by many of those poets. He started questioning the
    idol-worshipping and began to start preaching a new concept of one God, the
    creator—similar to the concepts of the Jews and the Christians of that
    time. Nonetheless, he was confused as to which God ought to be his God.
    Allah, a deity (a moon god--that is why the symbols placed at every mosque
    is a crescent moon) at that time, was the supreme God of the pagans. Their
    only fault was that besides Allah, they used to worship as the intercessors
    for Allah, the supreme other smaller gods/goddesses like: Hubal, Al-lat, Al-Uzza,
    Manat…etc. So, in the beginning of his new concept of an almighty creator
    Allah was out of his mind. Besides, at that time the magicians, the
    soothsayers, the sorcerers, and even the Satan worshippers used to vow by
    Allah. Thus, Muhammad found it utterly despicable to make Allah his God (ilah).</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">During those pagan days the people of
    Yemen used to worship another deity whose name was Ar-Rahman. <span lang="EN-AU">Muhammad,
    for a while, adopted the name Ar-Rahman for God in place of Allah.
    Coincidentally, Ar-Rahman was also the Jewish word <i>Rahmana</i> which was
    a name for God in the Talmudic period (Noldeke: <i>The Koran</i>, <i>The</i>
    <i>Origins of the Koran</i>, p.53). Muhammad cleverly thought that by using
    the word Ar-Rahman he ought to be able to attract to his new ‘religion’,
    the Jews as well as some pagans.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">However, when he declared <span lang="EN-AU">himself
    to be the messenger of Ar-Rahman, the Meccans, too, were at a loss and
    confused. The Meccans did not know of any Ar-Rahman other than the Ar-Rahman
    of al-Yamamah (some writers say Ar-Rahman was at Yemen). To verify
    Muhammad’s claim the Quraysh sent a delegation to Medina Jews, as they
    thought that Ar-Rahman, truly, was a deity in Yemen or Yamamah. Islamic
    Historian Ibn Sa’d (Ibn Sa’d, vol.i, pp.189-190) writes:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">“The
    Quraysh sent al-Nadr Ibn al-Harith Ibn ‘Alaqamah and ‘Uqbah Ibn abi
    Mu’ayt and others to the Jews of Yathrib and told them to ask them (Jews)
    about Muhammad. They came to Medinah and said to them (Jews): We have come
    to you because a great affair has taken place amidst us. There is a humble
    orphan who makes a big claim, considering himself to be the messenger of al-Rahman,
    while we do not know any al-Rahman except the Rahman of al-Yamamah. They
    said: Give the description before us. They gave his description, on which
    they asked them who were his followers. They said: The lowly people among
    us. Thereupon a scholar of from them laughed and said: he is the Prophet
    whose attributes we find mentioned in our Scriptures; we also know that his
    people will be most inimical to him.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">When we read, with an unbiased mind,
    the <span lang="EN-AU">first 50 Suras (in chronological order) of the </span>Qur’an
    <span lang="EN-AU">we note Muhammad’s confusion regrading Lord, Allah and
    Ar-Rahman. He was quite unsure of whom he should consider as his God (ilah).
    Here is a summary of the first 50 Suras regarding Muhammad’s idea of his
    God:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">This demonstrates Muhammad’s initial

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">In ancient Arabia
    poetry was a passion. Poets were highly regarded in society, and the words
    of many accomplished poets were regarded as next to god’s words. In a
    desert land, bereft of much entertainment and natural relaxation, the
    ancient Arabs used to find solace, peace, tranquillity and even the raging
    emotion of war and revenge through the mesmerising words of their poets.
    Poets supplied the Arabs with their mental food. Seven such poets had their
    verses permanently posted on the walls of Ka’ba. These verses were known
    as <i>Muallakat</i> or suspended.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><i><span lang="EN-AU">The Dictionary of
    Islam</span></i><span lang="EN-AU"> (Hughe’s Dictionary of Islam, p.460)
    writes that those verses were also known as <i>Muzahhabat</i> or the golden
    poems because they were written in gold. The authors of those poetical
    verses were: Zuhair, Trafah, Imrul Qays, Amru ibn Kulsum, al-Haris, Antarah
    and Labid.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">Among those seven
    immortal poets the most famous was Imrul Qays, the undisputed ‘king’ or
    the legend of Arabic poetry. He was a prince as his father was an Arab
    tribal king. Through his passionate devotion to love and poetry he irked his
    father and was banished from the palace. Thereafter, he lived a solitary
    life by tending the sheep and keeping alive his undying dedication to
    poetry. Eventually, he became a wanderer and led a melancholic life when his
    tribe was almost eliminated in a tribal war. He travelled around and finally
    arrived at Constantinople.&nbsp; It is said that he was put to death by the
    Roman ruler of Constantinople because he won the heart of a Roman princess
    through love and poetry. He died around the year 530-540 A.D., before
    Muhammad’s birth. His matchless verses were on the lips of many Arabs, and
    surely Muhammad had memorised many of his superb works. Muhammad is said to
    have declared Imrul Qais the greatest of Arab poets. No doubt then that he
    was keenly motivated to emulate Imrul Qais in the very early verses of the
    Qur’an.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">The chroniclers’
    of the Qur’an usually list Sura al-Alaq (the clot, Sura 96) as the first
    revelation of Allah to Muhammad. However, a systematic study of the Qur’an
    may reveal that that may not be the case at all. In fact, the <i>Dictionary
    of Islam</i> (Hughes Dictionary of Islam, p.485), citing Islamic sources,
    writes that some earliest Suras (before the first revelation, Sura 96) are
    most likely to be:</span></p>

    the author of the famous essay <i>The Origin of Islam</i> (The Origins of
    the Koran, pp.235-236), by comparing two passages from the <i>Sabaa
    Mu’allaqat,</i> finds close similarity with the verses from the Qur’an.
    Some of these verses are:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU"><br>
    Commenting on verse 54.1 W. St. Clair-Tisdall writes:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">‘It
    was the custom of the time for and orators to hang up their compositions
    upon the Ka’aba; and we know the seven <i>Mu’allaqat</i> were exposed.
    We are told that Fatima, the Prophet’s daughter, was one day repeating as
    she went along the above verse. Just then she met the daughter of Imrul Qays,
    who cried out, “O that’s what your father has taken from one of my
    father’s poems, and calls it something that has come down to him out of
    heaven;” and the story is commonly told amongst the Arabs until now.’</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">Thus, the
    relationship between Imrul Qays’ poems and some of the early verses of the
    Qur’an is pretty obvious. In this connection, W. St. Clair-Tisdall
    elaborates (The Origins of the Koran, p.236) further:</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;“The
    connection between the poetry of Imra’ul Qays and the Koran is so obvious
    that the Muslims cannot but hold that they existed with the latter in the
    Heavenly table from all eternity! What then will he answer? That the words
    were taken from the Koran and entered in the poem?—an impossibility. Or
    that their writer was not really Imra’ul Qays, but some other who, after
    the appearance of the Koran, had the audacity to quote them there as they
    now appear?—rather a difficult thing to prove!”<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">In fact, the word
    Allah is found in <i>Muallaqat</i> as well as in the <i>Diwan </i>of poet
    Labid. So when the Muslims claim the Qur’an to be the words of Allah, do
    they mean Allah copied the Qur’anic verses from Imrul Qays?</span></p>
