  <h3 align="center"><font size="5" color="#000080">George Bush Divides US or 
  us? </font></h3>
  <p align="center"><font size="4">By <a href="index.html">Abul Kasem</a></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When John Kerry, 
  after conceding his defeat in the recently held election, called President 
  Bush he reminded George Bush of the deep chasm that has engulfed the American 
  nation like nothing before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">George Bush agreed 
  with John Kerry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It looks like this 
  division is now spread all parts of the world, except of course, to the Muslim 
  World. The Muslim World was solidly behind John Kerry. Even the ex-Prime 
  Minister of Malaysia, who often chastises Western leaders for meddling in his 
  personal property (i.e., Malaysia), shamelessly harangued the Muslim Americans 
  not to vote for George Bush. To him, lecturing the citizens of the USA on how 
  to vote is not interfering in the domestic affairs of the US, but it is his 
  religious duty to rid the world of the disciple of the Great Satan. Did George 
  Bush admonish the self-appointed 21<sup>st</sup>. century Khalifa of the 
  Muslims? No, he did not. He simply kept quiet, preferring to let the American 
  people decide. Imagine what the new Caliph of the Muslim Ummah would do if 
  George Bush would have asked the Malaysians not to vote the ex-Prime Minister 
  during an election in Malaysia! &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the election 
  campaign Gorge Bush was portrayed as a liar, a war-monger, a Muslim-hater, a 
  Christian fundamentalist, a moron, the lowest I.Q President, a Texan Cow-boy 
  and whatnot.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So why did the 
  Americans vote in drove this Christian fundamentalist, a belligerent, a 
  non-apologist and a dunce for the White house for a second term? Let me ponder 
  on this matter, remembering the Australian election which was held just a 
  month ago (9<sup>th</sup> October, 2004).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While I may not be 
  very familiar with the American politics, I can, perhaps, relate this bizarre 
  American voter attitude from the example of the Australian voters. The 
  Australians re-elected John Howard’s conservative party (the Liberals) for the 
  fourth time defying the pundit’s prediction (from polls, of course) of a 
  comfortable, if not a land-slide, victory for the Labor Party of Australia 
  (ALP). The readers may draw an analogy between these two dominant parties of 
  Australia with that of the two major parties of the USA thus:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Australian 
  Liberal Party = the Republicans of the USA</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Australian Labor 
  Party = the Democrats of the USA. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The incumbent Prime 
  Minister John Howard was a Liberal candidate in this election. The opposition 
  was portrayed him as a liar, a war-monger, an enemy of the Muslims, a dullard, 
  a racist, a Christian bigot--simply because he refused to call back the 
  Australian troops from the war-ravaged Iraq. He is uncompromising in chasing 
  the Islamic Terrorists. He wants to catch them and punish them with full force 
  of the law. While the Australian Labor Party was somewhat ambivalent on 
  Islamic Terrorism, John Howard is absolutely unyielding in dealing with them. 
  He will not hesitate to go to war with his neighboring countries if Islamic 
  Terrorists attack Australia from their bases from any one of these 
  countries—that is his stand—crystal clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the election 
  result was announced John Howard won the election with more seats in the 
  Parliament than the previous poll. Not only that but he also won a comfortable 
  majority in the Senate which will enable him to pass new laws (to contain 
  terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism) with extreme ease. Seems like an exact 
  duplicate situation of the USA, isn’t it? &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the election 
  was over I heard many BD Muslims calling the Australians ‘stupid’ for electing 
  an enemy of Islam as the Prime Minister of Australia. They preferred Mark 
  Latham, the opposition Leader and a candidate of the Australian Labor party, 
  who, as a sign of his love for the Muslims, even nominated Ed Husic, a 
  ‘non-practicing’ Muslim as a candidate for a Sydney suburban electorate. For 
  the last couple of decades this electorate had always been won by a Labor 
  candidate. There was absolutely no way that this ‘non-practicing Muslim’ would 
  lose the election— every one thought. If that happened then Australia would 
  probably have its first ‘non-practicing Muslim’ in the Federal Parliament. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The result? Ed, 
  Husic the ‘non-practicing Muslim’ lost the election. He created a 
  history—because, hitherto, no Labor candidate for this area had lost election. 
  The liberal candidate, who is associated with Church-work won the election, 
  albeit, with a thin majority. This was a great windfall for John Howard to say 
  the least.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;So, why the 
  ‘stupid’ Australians re-elected to power a dullard, war-monger John Howard and 
  his party?&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Was it that John 
  Howard suddenly became the darling of the Australian voters because he is a 
  ’Christian Fundamentalist?’ After all, he is a regular church attendee and 
  espouses good Christian values. Of late, he became very unpopular on domestic 
  issues, such as: education, Medicare, taxation…etc. So, how such a 
  not-so-popular Prime Minister could get elected? &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The answer is not 
  difficult to fathom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You see, many 
  Australians who religiously voted for the Australian Labor Party on previous 
  elections changed their mind this time. They voted for the Liberal, forsaking 
  the better policies of the Labor on domestic matters. This time around, the 
  foremost concern in the minds of the most Australians was the issue of 
  security at home and the growing threat from the Islamic Terrorists. The 
  Australian electorate was savvy enough to realize the potential danger in 
  trusting a ‘flip-flop’ Labor party in dealing with the security of Australia. 
  At the top in the minds of the voters were the images of the Bali bombing of 
  October, 2002 and the recent terrorist bombing of the Australian Embassy at 
  Jakarta. How can the great majority of Australians, who had experienced the 
  barbarism of Islamic Terrorism hand over the matter security of their country 
  to a vacillating, non-focused, apologetic, compromising and unclear policies 
  of the Labor Party?—most Australians thought deeply. They were simply confused 
  and uncertain about the policies of the Labor party on internal security of 
  their peaceful country.<br>
  &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was such a 
  confused voter who eventually voted for the Liberal. In the last three Federal 
  elections I always voted for the Labor—no matter what policy they had. But 
  this time I changed my mind when the Labor declared that they would withdraw 
  the Australian troops from Iraq (if they won the election), would make 
  somewhat concessions to the terrorists (they called it reaching out for the 
  disgruntled and the oppressed). It was enough for me. I had to change my mind 
  because:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I traveled to 
  work by train I remembered the Madrid bombing.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I entered the 
  multi-storied office building I recalled the 9/11.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I entered a pub 
  or a busy restaurant I remembered Bali—Kuta Beach resort.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When my son, a 
  child, goes to his school I remembered Beslan massacre of the innocent 
  kindergarten children.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When my wife goes to 
  shopping in the biggest shopping complex in Sydney I worry about her return.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">………………………………….</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And so on.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such was the mental 
  anxiety for most Australian voters regardless of their party affiliation and 
  the principles they stood for. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They could not trust 
  a party which would compromise with the security of Australia.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That was why John 
  Howard was the clearest choice for the electorate. It was his indomitable and 
  uncompromising stand on the terrorists who want to kill the Australians with 
  merciless vigor and destroy their way of life, simply because they are 
  infidels. &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is interesting to 
  note that the Labor Party of Australia expected the new young voters to vote 
  overwhelmingly for them. But that did not happen either. The election result 
  demonstrated that the vast majority of the first-time voters--many of them 
  university ‘freshies’—a Labor vote-bank abandoned the Labor Party; instead, 
  they voted either the Liberals or the Greens, a small ‘environmental’ party. 
  This deprived the Labor the victory that they were almost certain.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many irreligious 
  persons, atheists, secularists, leftists, socialists, communists voted for the 
  Liberals too, knowing very well John Howard’s support for the Church and the 
  Christian schools. Previously, they could have never thought of voting for a 
  ‘dullard’ and a ‘dross’, Johnny--to put it mildly.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not surprising 
  that same pattern of voting was reflected in the US election.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As mentioned at the 
  beginning of this essay that the result of the Presidential election in the 
  USA has divided not only the US society but also the world. It is no wonder to 
  witness this division in many cyber forums like MM, Vinnomot, FFI just to name 
  a few. Some members of such forums openly supported John Kerry (or George 
  Bush) and transformed their website as an election propaganda platform. When 
  the Republicans won the election many members in the opposite camp were 
  disappointed, hurt and angry. Some of them even suggested that the re-election 
  of George Bush will encourage more terrorism, more Islamic fundamentalism. 
  This translates into more bloodshed and mayhem—according to them. Some of them 
  even suggest that President George Bush has turned himself into a Christian 
  fundamentalist waging Crusade against the Muslims. While I guess most 
  Americans are religious, still America is the most staunchly secular country 
  in the world. Same goes for Australia. Though the vast majority of the 
  Australians are Christians and quite religious, the secular nature of 
  Australia, including all its secular laws remain intact no matter which party 
  is in power. No party can change this status of Australia—not even John 
  Howard, even though he had a very good support from many Church based parties. 
  &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I think America 
  stands exactly in the same position. The secular nature of America can never 
  change—not even in a few centuries. Therefore, the thought of Christian 
  fundamentalism and Crusade are simply far-fetched and ill-motivated. George 
  Bush and John Howard are doing simply their duties to their citizen—protect 
  them at any cost—fight fire with fire, if need be.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I must say that if 
  anyone is responsible for the perceived rise of Christian fundamentalism it is 
  actually due to the ascent of Islamic fundamentalism for the last few decades. 
  When the Christians, the Hindus, the Buddhists find that they are being 
  attacked, killed, burned and tortured by the Islamic Terrorists they have no 
  choice but to turn to the parties that promise complete security to them. 
  Ordinary people cannot depend upon the incomprehensible hypothesis of the 
  liberals and the philosophical doctrines of the leftists. They need to protect 
  themselves first—even if that means to resort to the use of force. That is why 
  we see the rise of the Hindu fundamentalists in India in BJP and the rise of 
  the extreme rightists in other countries, such as Austria, the 
  Netherlands…etc. Violence begets violence—it is as simple as this. And it is 
  Islamic Terrorism that started it all.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Remove Islamic 
  Terrorism from the face of the earth and you will find no other religious 
  fundamentalism/terrorism. Christian, Hindu or Budddhist fundamentalisms are 
  the reaction of Islamic Terrorism perpetrated by the Muslim fundamentalists-- 
  let’s face this truth. Islamic Terrorism cannot be removed through dialogue or 
  negotiation. These terrorists do not believe in give-and-take--the very 
  fundamental of any negotiation process. In fact, the terrorists consider an 
  offer of negotiation as a sign of weakness—a time for a brief respite—a good 
  opportunity to re-plan and execute further genocide and mayhem to establish 
  Islamic Paradises in world. Anyone who offers an olive branch to the 
  terrorists is simply drawing more Trojan Horses into his backyard.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, I would 
  like to stress the importance of maintaining a bystander’s attitude in a cyber 
  forum. It is unwise for an Internet forum to be brazenly partisan. A forum is 
  not a political party. Members of these forums come from diverse backgrounds 
  and they are spread around the globe. Just because they are in agreement with 
  a few policies/ideas/philosophy does not mean that all of them must agree with 
  the political, cultural and domestic issues of any or all countries. As an 
  example: During the next Singapore election which political party should MM or 
  Vinnomot support—PAP (People’s Action Party) or the opposition Workers Party? 
  Surely, this is a contentious issue and it will be imprudent and childish to 
  openly advertise for any one party. If a certain member writes anything about 
  any party let that be only his personal opinion. The moderators and the key 
  members of the group should, as far as possible, keep silence on the election 
  issue. This, I think, should be a wise approach. It will prevent the 
  unnecessary, hurt feeling, anger, frustration and jealousy in the forum.
