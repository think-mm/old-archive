    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">During Muhammad’s time, a
    religious movement to counter paganism was taking shape. Led by a group of
    ‘freethinkers’, this group rejected paganism, and to fulfil their
    spiritual needs they were searching for an alternative religion. They were
    known as Hanifites or simply as Hanifs.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The <i>Dictionary of Islam</i>
    (Hughes Dictionary of Islam, pp.161-162) writes that the original meaning of
    Hanif was a convert or a pervert [sort of apostate--to say].&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The other meanings of Hanif are:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU">1. Any
    one sincere in his inclination to Islam 2. One orthodox in the faith 3. One
    who is of the religion of Abraham.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">W. St. Clair-Tisdall (<i>The Sources
    of Islam</i>, The Origins of the Koran, p.289) writes:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU">’The
    word Hanif, indeed, originally signified “unclean” or “apostate,”
    and was so used by the idolatrous Arabs of Zaid, because he abandoned the
    worship of gods.’</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Muhammad later used the word Hanif,
    first for the religion of Abraham, then for any sincere believer of Islam.
    Thus, the Muslims are supposed to be Hanifs—and truly speaking, the
    followers of Zayd! In the same essay W. St. Clair-Tisdal (ibid)) writes
    further, “The name pleased the Prophet and was used by him in a good
    sense.”&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">According to Ibn Ishaq (Ibn Ishaq,
    p.99) the most famous of those apostates (Hanifs) in Mecca during
    Muhammad’s time were:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <ol style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0in" type="1">
      <li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Waraqa b. Naufal: he became a
        Christian</span>
      <li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Ubaydullah b. Jahsh: he became a
        Christian after migrating to Abyssinia. His wife was Umm Habiba d. Abu
        Sufyan whom Muhammad married later</span>
      <li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Uthman b. al-Huwayrith. He later
        went to the Byzantine emperor and became a Christian</span>
      <li class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Zayd b. Amr b. Naufal left
        paganism saying that he worshipped the God of Abraham</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Waraqa was the cousin brother of
    Khadijah, Muhammad’s first wife. Some authors suggest that he was a Jew
    before embracing Christianity. Ubaydullah was the grandson of Abd al-Muttalib
    and Uthman b. al-Huwayrith was offered a high position in the Byzantine
    court of Syria.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Only Zayd b. Amr remained a diehard
    Hanif. He used to say (ibid, p.287), “I worship the god of Abraham,” but
    he blamed his people for having chosen the evil ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">According to W. St. Clair-Tisdal (<i>The
    Sources of Islam</i>, The Origins of the Koran, pp.229-230) Zayd worshipped
    yearly in a cave near Mecca, and no doubt influenced Muhammad who used to
    visit the same place for quiet and lonely contemplation.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Ibn Ishaq (Ibn Ishaq, pp.99-100)
    writes that when Zayd b. Amr faced the Ka’ba he used to say ‘Labbaka in
    truth, in worship and in service.’&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">When Zayd stood and faced Qibla he
    would say (ibid), “I take refuge in what Abraham took refuge.”&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Zayd also abhorred animal sacrifice
    to idols and condemned the pagan practice of burying alive new-born females
    (this, I believe, was a very rare practice--as not a single instance of live
    burial of a female baby is cited either in the Qur’an or in <i>Ahadith: </i>these
    books vaguely talk about this pagan practice without citing any specific
    case of live burial).&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Abu Bakr’s daughter, Amina once
    saw a very old Zayd bin ‘Amr in Ka’ba. On this, Ibn Ishaq writes </span>(Ibn
    Ishaq, pp.99-100):</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">‘Hisham b. Urwa from his
    father on the authority of his mother Asma d. Abu Bakr said that she saw
    Zayd as a very old man leaning his back on the Ka’ba and saying, ‘O
    Quraysh, By Him in whose hand is the soul of Zayd, not one of you follows
    the religion of Abraham but I.’ Then he said: ‘O God, if I knew how you
    wished to be worshipped I would so worship you; but I do not know.’ Then
    he prostrated himself on the palms of his hands.’</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Historical records do not mention
    clearly what eventually happened to Zayd b. Amr. However, Ibn Ishaq writes
    that Caliph Umar’s father, al-Khattab (Umar b. al-Khattab was Zayd’s
    nephew) used to severely harass Zayd b. Amr and he was finally killed. Who
    killed Zayd is a complete mystery. Here is what Ibn Ishaq (Ibn Ishaq, p.102)
    writes:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU">“When
    al-Khattab (Umar’s father) harassed Zayd bin ‘Amr so much so that he was
    forced to withdraw to the upper part of Mecca and he stopped in the mountain
    of Hira facing the town. Zayd could visit Mecca in secret only.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU">Then Zayd
    left Mecca seeking the religion of Abraham—went through all of Syria. Then
    Zayd returned to Mecca but was killed.”</span><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">As written previously, because of
    his uncompromising stand on Hanifite movement and because of his deriding
    remarks on paganism, the Quraysh expelled Zayd b. Amr from Mecca and he was
    forbidden to live there. He was a severely ostracised person, boycotted and
    utterly disdained by the larger section of the Quraysh. He had to live in
    the cave of mount Hira, opposite the city. Muhammad, being a forlorn person
    at that time used to meet Zayd in the cave of Hira.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Ibn Ishaq also writes that Gabriel
    used to visit Muhammad at the Hira cave. When we consider the fact that on
    many instances Muhammad had confessed that Gabriel, on many occasions had
    met Muhammad in the form of human beings it is quite likely that when
    Muhammad visited&nbsp; Zayd b. Amr many times to learn about the new
    religion of the ‘Hanif’ he might have thought Zayd to be the angel
    Gabriel. It is also quite probable that Zayd b. Amr took an interest in
    teaching Muhammad how to read (and write)—his poetry (or verses) that
    later became Qur’anic verses!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Ibn Ishaq (Ibn Ishaq, p.105) writes
    that Muhammad used to pray in seclusion in Hira every year for a month to
    practice ‘tahnanuth’, a pagan practice (thus confirming again
    Muhammad’s pagan background). According to the Quraysh, ‘tahannuth’
    meant religious devotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i><span lang="EN-AU">Sahih Bukhari</span></i><span lang="EN-AU">
    confirms that Muhammad had encountered Zayd b. Amr in the Valley of Hira

    Zaid bin 'Amr, but Zaid refused to eat of it and then said (to the pagans),
    &quot;I do not eat of what you slaughter on your stone altars (Ansabs) nor
    do I eat except that on which Allah's Name has been mentioned on
    slaughtering.&quot;</span></p>

    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU">The Prophet met Zaid bin 'Amr
    bin Nufail in the bottom of (the valley of) Baldah before any Divine
    Inspiration came to the Prophet. A meal was presented to the Prophet but he
    refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to Zaid) who said, &quot;I do
    not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols. I eat
    none but those things on which Allah's Name has been mentioned at the time
    of slaughtering.&quot; Zaid bin 'Amr used to criticize the way Quraish used
    to slaughter their animals, and used to say, &quot;Allah has created the
    sheep and He has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown the
    grass for it from the earth; yet you slaughter it in other than the Name of
    Allah. He used to say so, for he rejected that practice and considered it as
    something abominable.</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU">Narrated Ibn 'Umar: Zaid
    bin 'Amr bin Nufail went to Sham, inquiring about a true religion to follow.
    He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him about their religion. He
    said, &quot;I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me some thing about
    it.&quot; The Jew said, &quot;You will not embrace our religion unless you
    receive your share of Allah's Anger.&quot; Zaid said, &quot;'I do not run
    except from Allah's Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I have the
    power to avoid it. Can you tell me of some other religion?&quot; He said,
    &quot;I do not know any other religion except the Hanif.&quot; Zaid
    enquired, &quot;What is Hanif?&quot; He said, &quot;Hanif is the religion of
    (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used to
    worship None but Allah (Alone)&quot; Then Zaid went out and met a Christian
    religious scholar and told him the same as before. The Christian said,
    &quot;You will not embrace our religion unless you get a share of Allah's
    Curse.&quot; Zaid replied, &quot;I do not run except from Allah's Curse, and
    I will never bear any of Allah's Curse and His Anger if I have the power to
    avoid them. Will you tell me of some other religion?&quot; He replied,
    &quot;I do not know any other religion except Hanif.&quot; Zaid enquired,
    &quot;What is Hanif?&quot; He replied, Hanif is the religion of (the
    prophet) Abraham who was neither a Jew nor a Christian and he used to
    worship None but Allah (Alone)&quot; When Zaid heard their Statement about
    (the religion of) Abraham, he left that place, and when he came out, he
    raised both his hands and said, &quot;O Allah! I make You my Witness that I
    am on the religion of Abraham.&quot;</span></p>
    <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><span lang="EN-AU">Narrated Asma bint Abi Bakr:
    I saw Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail standing with his back against the Ka'ba and
    saying, &quot;O people of Quraish! By Allah, none amongst you is on the
    religion of Abraham except me.&quot; He used to preserve the lives of little
    girls: If somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would say to him, &quot;Do
    not kill her for I will feed her on your behalf.&quot; So he would take her,
    and when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, &quot;Now if you
    want her, I will give her to you, and if you wish, I will feed her on your
    behalf.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The first <i>Hadis</i> tells us
    something about Muhammad’s paganism—that, in the beginning, he probably
    ate the meat offered to the idols by the pagans (thus confirming Hisham ibn
    al-Kalbi—see Part1/5 of this essay), but Zayd b. Amr steadfastly refused
    to eat any meat slaughtered in the name of idols. Muhammad learned from Zayd
    not to eat the pagans’ meat (or <i>Haram</i> meat). The second <i>Hadis</i>
    apparently contradicts the first <i>Hadis</i> (7.67.407) on Muhammad’s
    consumption of ‘pagan’ or <i>Haram</i> meat. However, a little thought
    on this <i>Hadis</i> evidently shows that Muhammad followed Zayd with
    respect to <i>Halal</i> meat, and from Zayd he also obtained the idea of
    Allah to be his (Muhammad’s) God. Can we not, therefore, conclude that the
    idea of Islam really came from Zayd? In the biography of Muhammad written by
    Ibn Ishaq we find several verses of poetry written by Zayd that are quite
    similar to some verses of the Qur’an. Therefore, isn’t it sufficient to
    say that after the sudden, mysterious and untimely killing of Zayd Muhammad
    took up his mantle, philosophy, poetry and the zeal to propagate ‘Hanifism’?</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Ibn Sa’d (Ibn Sa’d, vol.i,
    p.185) writes that when Muhammad started his Islam, a convert told Muhammad
    about the words of Zayd ibn Amr and Muhammad replied, “I have seen him in
    Paradise drawing his skirts.” This proves that Muhammad acknowledged the
    piety and contribution of Zayd towards the concept of Islam or Hanifism.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The following excerpts from the

    disliked them. I went to Syria and its adjoining territories till I came to
    my strangeness with my people and my abhorrence for idol worship, Judaism
    and Christianity. He said to me: I see you are in search of the creed of
    Ibrahim. O Makkan brother! You are seeking a creed which is not practiced
    now a days. It is the creed of your ancestor, Ibrahim, and it is the true
    faith. He (Ibrahim) was neither a Jew nor a Christian. He used to offer

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">These verses are:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Evidently, the above verses were

    Zayd died Muhammad simply passed them up as Allah’s revelations to him.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Those examples demonstrate that Muhammad had copied

    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-AU" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">Labid</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Labid was another poet whom Muhammad admired a lot. We
    will now briefly review the contribution of this poet towards the authorship
    of the Qur’an.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Labid was the son of Rabiah ibn
    Jafar al-Amiri. <i>Dictionary of Islam</i> (Hughes Dictionary of Islam,
    p.282) reports that Labid died at Kufah in Iraq at the age of 157. As told
    before, Labid was one of the 7 magnificent poets of <i>Muallaqat</i>.
    Islamic historians claim that Labid embraced Islam when he saw the first
    verse of Sura al-Bakara (Sura 2) posted up at Ka’ba; he withdrew his
    verses and embraced Islam. This claim, of course, cannot be true, as the
    first verse of Sura al-Bakara is simply: Alif. Lam. Mim--the cryptic message
    which even Muhammad claimed that only Allah knew their meaning. Labid’s
    verse was: “Know that everything is vanity but God.” Muhammad said the
    same to Labid—the truest poet.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Even if one accepts the assertion
    that Labid became a Muslim after reading Muhammad’s verses then it is more
    palpable that it was indeed Labid who helped Muhammad to construct poetical
    verses that were, later, passed up as messages of Allah via Gabriel. Those
    verses which Labid wrote on behalf of Muhammad were mostly the verses
    dealing with piety, exhortation of good deeds, some narrations of Arab
    practices… etc.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">In <i>Ahadith</i> we find references
    of Labid. Here are some samples:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">I think Muhammad, in the beginning,
    wanted to be a famous poet by simply mimicking the style, the vocabulary and
    the rhythm of the poets of his time. However, his illiteracy proved to be
    the major stumbling block, until he met Zayd ibn Amr and Labid—his mentors
    who would completely change his course.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">In the beginning and before his
    marriage to Khadijah, Muhammad was probably more inclined to be a poet. He
    deeply admired the above three personalities, two of them were poets and the
    third (Zayd b. Amr) a humanist in to-day’s language. Nonetheless, after
    his marriage to Khadijah, and when he came in contact with several
    personalities related to her who were well-versed in religions other than
    paganism, Muhammad changed his mind. Now, he thought of introducing a new
    belief system. In fact, the Qur’an narrates that the Quraysh considered
    that Muhammad was trying to be a poet, but Allah scolded the Quraysh for
    their wrong assumption.</span></p>
