	<font face="Verdana"><b>A brief history of Allah<font size="2"><br>
	</font></b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">When we study Allah seriously, 
	the important feature to learn is that Allah has quite a fascinating 
	history. In ancient Arabia, during biblical time, many millenniums before 
	Muhammad was born, Allah was worshipped by the desert Bedouins of Arabia. 
	The ancient Arabs associated Allah with the moon which shone clearly in the 
	night sky of the vast and wild desert for most of the year. The reason why 
	Allah was treated as a moon god is not difficult to understand. The Bedouin 
	Arabs had a nomadic life. Living in a harsh, barren, desert–land, devoid of 
	any perennial river for irrigation and incapable of sustaining an 
	agricultural society, the Bedouin Arabs belonged to a pastoral society. They 
	were half-starved anarchic tribes (Rodinson, 2002, p. 17). Their meagre 
	livelihood grossly depended on grazing and tending cattle, conducting 
	frequent raids and plunder on other tribes or on the passing caravans. 
	Rodinson writes that the unruly Arabs vendetta is the pillar of Bedouin 
	society (Rodinson, 2002, p. 14). The Bedouins during those days also had a 
	life of unceasing cycles of plunder and revenge. Day-time travel was nearly 
	impossible due to the unbearable heat of the sun. Most journeys were 
	undertaken at night, on moonlight and beneath a sky bedecked with glittering 
	stars. They marvelled at the exquisitely beautiful night sky with the moon 
	at its centre of beauty. To them the emergence of the graceful moon was the 
	appearance of the king of the night sky. That is why those indigent Bedouin 
	Arabs were so intimately connected with the moon and its phases. Their lives 
	were literally governed by the moon.<br>
	<br>
	To them, the moon was their life-sustainer. They based their primitive 
	calendar on the movement of the moon; their religious and communal 
	ceremonies were all arranged according to the moon’s position and phases. No 
	wonder, that those desert Arabs considered moon as their highest deity—Allah 
	Taalaa–the supreme God. Professor of Arab History, the late, Phillip K. 
	Hitti, writes that the moon-worshipping is principally a pastoral society 
	and the sun-worshiping is chiefly an agricultural society (Hitti, 2002, p. 
	97). To the Arab Bedouin folks, moon was an absolute holy entity to be 
	worshipped and revered with utmost zeal. After Muhammad forced, at the point 
	of sword, Islam on these desert Arab indigents, these neo-</font></span><font size="2">Muslim 
	Bedouins still continued with the practice of their age–old belief that 
	their life was regulated by the moon.<br>
	<br>
	<span lang="EN-GB">Even today, we find that this obsession with the Arab 
	Bedouin moon is strongly prevalent in Islam. Islam is intimately connected 
	with the moon. All its rituals are based on the sighting of the moon or on 
	the moon calendar. No matter how much Islam advocates that it shuns idolatry 
	or Paganism, it has not shed off its past connection with Paganism and 
	idolatry. The truth is: Islam is still symbolised with the moon, especially 
	the crescent shape. Look at the spires of any
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.islamicity.com/Culture/MOSQUES/Madinah/PMO.htm">
	mosques</a>; you are bound to witness a dazzling crescent moon, sometimes 
	along with a star as well. Later, I shall provide the historical reason why 
	the star is also a symbol of Islam. To explicate further, look at the symbol 
	of Red Cross in Islamic Paradises. It is, of course, a crescent&#8209;the symbol 
	of Islam, which was the ubiquitous emblem of the moon god of the Arab 
	Pagans. Even the flags of many Islamic countries show either the crescent 
	moon and star together, or the crescent moon alone. Have a look at the 
	national flags of a few Islamic states, such as:

	Arabs. Even Muhammad kissed hugged it in his chest it with deep reverence, 
	Caliph Umar did the same and the Muslims are supposed to do this at least

	<br>
	Historians believe that that the Arabian Allah originated in Syria. The 
	Aramaeans inhabited Syria around 1300 BC. These Syrians used to worship 
	passionately a few deities, the principal among them were the storm-god 
	Hadad; the sky-god Alaha and the goddess Athargatis. The Syrians probably 
	got Allah (in some form of image) from the Sumer in the ancient city of
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.balaams-ass.com/alhaj/page15.htm">
	Babylon</a>. According to many historians, Alaha is the Syrian name of Allah 
	(Walker, 2004, p. 20). To them, Allah was a male God, the supreme God, who 
	had three daughters, Allat, Uzza and Manat. The Nabateans, the first-born 
	son of Ismail around Sinai Peninsula, were the first to bring Allah to 
	Arabia from Syria (Walker, 2004, p. 22) The Nabateans probably worshipped 
	Allah in other names as well, such as: <i>Elh and Alh</i> (ibid). Besides 
	Allah, the Nabateans also brought from Syria Hubal, a huge male idol. This 
	Hubal was later placed in the precinct of Ka’ba. Hubal was the greatest of 
	all idols in and around Ka’ba. The massive statue of Hubal was made of red 
	agnate in the form of a man with right hand broken off. The Quraysh received 
	Hubal in this form from Khuzaymah ibn Mudrikah, a Meccan who brought it from 
	Syria. Later, the Quraysh made for it a hand of gold. Hubal stood in front 
	of Ka’ba. The Pagan Quraysh considered Ka’ba for Hubal only (Rodinson, 2002, 
	p. 54). They used divination arrows to determine the legitimacy of a newly 
	born child (Al-Kalbi, 1952, p. 23). Many historians believe that Hubal was 
	the physical representation of Allah at Ka’ba. In his youth Muhammad helped 
	with the ritualistic preparations being ardently made for the ceremonial 
	installation of Hubal in Ka’ba (Walker, 2004, p. 42). Muhammad’s biographer, 
	Martin Lings, a Catholic convert to Islam, agrees that Hubal was from Syria 
	(Lings, 1983, p. 5, 11). Arab Historians believe that the mighty Hubal was 
	actually an ancient variation of Allah (Walker, 2004, p. 31). The word (Hubal) 
	is derived from the Semitic word <i>Hu,</i> which means ‘He’ or ‘He is’ with 
	the suffix <i>El</i>, which, of course, is another name for Allah. The 
	deified name of Hubal was ceremoniously invoked by the Quraysh during war 
	cry (ibid). Gradually, the concept of Allah, the God spread all around 
	Arabia. An inscription found in south Arabia bears the name of Allah. Allah 
	is Hallah in the Safa inscription. This was five centuries before Islam. The 
	Arabs used to invoke Allah during times of special peril. This all-powerful 
	Allah gradually became the supreme tribal deity of the Quraysh. Even the 
	holy Qur’an confirms this in verses
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/006.qmt.html">

	31:29</a> (Hitti, 2002, pp. 100–101). Other names by which Allah was known 
	are: the Babylonian and Assyrian <i>Ilu</i>, the Canaanite <i>El</i>, the 
	Hebrew <i>Elohim</i> and <i>Ilah</i> of central Arabia (Walker, 2004, p. 
	420). <br>
	<br>
	Another name of Allah was Wadd—the moon god which stood at the head of the 
	Minaean Pantheon. Allat, Uzza and Manat were the three daughters of Allah 
	for this Wadd (Hitti, 2002, pp. 97–98). <br>
	<br>
	An additional version of Allah came from Hadramawt in south Arabia. There, 
	Allah was known as <i>Sin</i>, the moon god. A famous south Arabian ancient 
	city was Saba, where the queen of Saba or queen Bilqis ruled. The Sabaeans 
	also worshipped Allah. People there called Allah as Almaqah (Hitti, 2002, p. 
	60). In the Qur’an we find the reference of queen of Saba in
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/027.qmt.html">
	sura 27</a> (sura an-Naml), where this ancient biblical city is called Sheba 
	and the queen Bilqis is referred simply as queen Sheba. Sabaean religion was 
	based on planetary astral system in which the cult of the moon was 
	prevalent. Invariably, the Sabaeans worshipped Allah as a moon God. However, 
	unlike the Pagan Arabs, they had no clear picture of their Allah and thought 
	Him to be a shapeless, male deity of supreme power. On this deity, Benjamin 
	walker writes:</font></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shadowy 
	ineffable deity, Allah was not represented by any image, nor did he enjoy 
	popular cult adoration, as did the lesser gods and goddesses. To distinguish 
	him from the other gods, he was given the title of Allah Taala, ‘God Most 
	High’ (Walker, 2004, p. 42).</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Besides Allah and other 
	Gods, the Nabateans also worshipped two other gods (probably lesser to 
	Allah), namely; ar-Rahman and ar-Rahim. Both ar-Rahman and ar-Rahim were 
	devoutly worshipped together in conjunction with honor and prestige. The 
	Qur’an, surprisingly, retains the names of these two Pagan deities, though 
	claiming that these two names belong to Allah. The very first sura of the 
	Qur’an (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/001.qmt.html">sura 
	Fatiha</a>) mentions these two names, just during the beginning. 
	Furthermore, sura 19 (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/019.qmt.html">sura 
	Maryam</a>) is dominated by the names of these two deities.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">According to Professor 
	Hitti, the Pagan Nabateans of north Arabia first introduced ar-Rahman and 
	ar-Rahim probably from southern Syria. Later these two names of Pagan gods 
	found their place in the pantheons of South Arabian temples (Hitti, 2002, p. 
	105). Muhammad’s competitor, Maslama (or Musaylima) preached in the name of 
	ar-Rahman, the south Arabian Allah (Rodinson, 2002, p. 67, 119). This could 
	probably be the reason why Muhammad, later abandoned ar-Rahman and adopted 
	the Allah of the Meccan Pagans as his only God.</font></p>

	According to Arab historians, Petra (north Arabia, close to Syria, the home 
	of the Nabateans), had a kind of Ka’ba with Dushara (Dusares), worshipped

	(Hitti, 2002, p. 72).</span></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">This very short history

	Jehovah</a> depicted in a German coin). Islam claims Moses worshipped the 
	same Allah as the Muslims. If the Qur’an is true then simple logic says: <b>
	Jehovah = Allah</b>. <br>
	As per historical records, <i>Jehovah</i> was a desert Allah, simple and 
	austere. His abode was a tent (Hitti, 2002, p. 40). Although the Jews admit 
	that <i>Jehovah</i> is their Lord, the Hebrew Allah, they avoid every 
	mention of it. <i>Jehovah</i> also means: “The great and terrible”, and that 
	is the reason why the Jews refrain from mentioning the name <i>Jehovah</i> 
	(Hughes, 1994, p. 226). Instead, Rabb—Lord, stands in the relative position 
	of the Jehovah (Ibid, p. 141). So, as far as the Qur’an goes, if <i>Jehovah</i> 
	is Allah then He must be the terrible Allah of the Jews.</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">The Bedouin Arabs’ 
	primary concern was with the moon Allah, their supreme deity and His 
	daughters, Allat, Uzza and Manat. As explicated before, the moon is the 
	central religious theme in a pastoral society. The illiterate, half–starved 
	and ill-informed Bedouin Arabs associated the moon with strength, vitality, 
	force, power and everything to do with masculinity. As such, the moon (and 
	Allah) was really a male God; there should be very little doubt on this (you 
	will read more on this later). So, how about the sun? Had the sun any 
	position as god in the Pagan society? The answer is yes. The Bedouins also 
	worshipped a sun god. Its name was <b>Baal</b>. Curiously, the Syrians and 
	the Phoenicians also worshipped Baal—Lord, an idol. It is believed that Baal 
	was worshipped in the days of Prophet Elisha (Hughes, 1004, p. 35). The 
	Egyptians adopted Baal as their Lord (or sun Allah). Baal (see Baal
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://gtae.users.btopenworld.com/godsB.htm">
	here</a>) was represented as a man with pointed beard and with horned 
	helmet. He was a god of war, sky, storm, fertility and good harvest. In 
	Qur’an we find the mention of Baal when Prophet <span lang="EN-GB">Elias 
	admonished his people for worshipping Baal (the sun Allah), instead of the 
	moon Allah, the best of creators (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/037.qmt.html">37:125</a>). 
	A contradictory version of the sun god is that the sun was a goddess, called 
	Shams (Rodinson, 2002, p. 23). Oddly, there is a sura in the Qur’an (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/091.qmt.html">sura 
	91</a>, a Meccan sura) whose title is <b><i>Shams</i></b> or the Sun. 
	Muhammad clearly preferred <i>Shams</i> to Baal, the Egyptian sun god. Not 
	surprisingly though, there is also a sura in the Qur’an titled <b><i>Qamar</i></b> 
	or the moon (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/054.qmt.html">sura

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Why Muhammad had a 
	profound dislike for the sun Allah, Baal? The answer is quite simple. The 
	sun is the principal source of an agricultural society. Therefore, it is 
	natural that an agricultural society will adopt the sun Allah, Baal as its 
	principal deity. That was why, Egypt, an agrarian society adopted Baal. 
	Muhammad, who belonged to a pastoral society, was not interested in 
	agriculture (more on this later)—so, why should he bother about Baal? Thus, 
	Baal, the sun Allah was not that popular in Muhammad’s Arabia.</font></p>

	the Meccan Pagans were very familiar with their moon Allah (read more on

	practiced to divide their offerings of crops to Allah and other idols, like: 
	Ammanas in the Khaulan country (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/006.qmt.html">6.136</a>) 
	(ibn Ishaq, 2001, p. 37). It was a customary religious system for the Pagan 
	Arabs that they had practiced for generations. Then <span lang="EN-GB">
	Muhammad started preaching, exhorting the Meccan Quraysh to worship Allah 
	only (kind of only Allah’s monotheism). Muhammad had now his own version of 
	Allah, which the Pagan Arabs found very confusing and distressing. He 
	started admonishing them for sharing their crop with other deities besides 
	Allah, Muhammad’s variety of Allah, to be specific. But the Meccan Quraysh 
	were tolerant. They let Muhammad preach whatever he wished. The trouble came 
	when Muhammad wanted to hit the Quraysh’s principal source of revenue, the 
	pilgrimage and the tourism which were closely connected with the visit of 
	their pantheon of many gods and goddesses. The Meccan Pagans even had the 
	images of Abraham, Jesus and Mary—just to attract Christian and Jewish 
	tourists. During Muhammad’s time, according to Phillip Hitti, the eminent 
	Arab</span> historian, Mecca had a colony of Abyssinian Christians (Hitti, 
	2002, p. 106).</font></p>

	disrupt severely their flourishing tourism’s attractiveness by creating 
	anarchy with Muhammad’s followers. Despite Muhammad’s harangues and tirades 
	they left him alone. Even the eminent historian al-Tabari admits that 
	Muhammad had very little sufferings from the Meccan Pagans. According to 
	Tabari, </span>Muhammad’s followers were largely young men, some of whom 
	were sons and younger brothers of the leading merchants. Muhammad had very 
	little suffering in the hands of the Quraysh, apart from little annoyance.

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">The main reason for the

	diminish the profit of the greedy Meccan merchants. These merchants also 
	felt that Muhammad was probably threatening their political control of the 
	Meccan affairs. The Quraysh were not particularly hostile to Muhammad until 
	he mentioned their idols. In particular, the rejection of Allat, one of the 
	daughters of Allah, affected the business of Taif merchants (Ibid, pp. 6.42,

	their children after it. She was at Qudayd, between Medina and Mecca. They 
	used to sacrifice before her—particularly Aws and Khazraj as well as the 
	inhabitants of Medina and Mecca. At the end of pilgrimage, when about to 
	return home, people would set out to the place of Manah, shave their heads

	53:20</a>. She was the goddess of the Hudhayl and the Khuza’ah. Ali

	swords—presented to Manah by al-Harith ibn Abi-Shamir al-Ghaassan, the king 
	of Ghassan. These swords were called Mikhdam and Rasub. Muhammad gave these 
	two swords to Ali. Dhu-al-Faqr was one of these swords. It was the sword of

	these two swords in the temple of al-Fals, the idol of Tayyi (ibn al-Kalbi,

	Here are a few more comments on the three daughters of Allah: Allat, Uzza

	Allat was the goddess of war, Uzza, the goddess of sacrifice and Manat, the 
	goddess of destiny or fate (Walker, 2004, p. 45).<br>
	Allat was connected with the moon, Uzza with the planet Venus and Manat with 
	the star Sirius (Ibid, p. 46).<br>
	The above information will clarify why Islam’s symbol is the crescent and a 
	star. Clearly, Paganism in Islam is still inherent, if we have to interpret 
	these symbols: Crescent—for Allah and the star (Venus)–for His daughter 
	Uzza.The third daughter of Allah, Manat is represented by the star Sirius. 
	Even the Qur’an says that Allah is the Lord of the Alpha Sirius. Here is the 
	Qur’anic verse on the star Alpha Sirius (Manat). Needless to say, the 
	Islamist scholars have a different version of interpretation of these

	Here Allah mentions the story of Maryam and her son `Isa, just after 
	mentioning Zakariyya and his son Yahya, may peace be upon them all. He 
	mentions the story of Zakariyya first, followed by the story of Maryam 
	because the one is connected to the other. The former is the story of a

	been barren and had never given birth when she was younger. Then Allah

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">We might be amazed at so 
	many different versions of Allah. But hold on. Does not the Qur’an say that 
	Allah has many names? If fact, the Islamic scholars insist that Allah has 
	ninety-nine names (including Allah, this makes it a century, to be precise). 
	Although we do not find any verses in the Qur’an which specifically spells 
	out this number (ninety-nine), we should not be surprised at so many names 
	(in reality, different versions) of Allah. The only problem is: if we read 
	the Qur’an carefully, cover to cover, several times, we might find many more 
	names of Allah than the ninety-nine as claimed by the Islamist scholars. We 
	should not be amazed if we note that there are around three hundred (yes, 
	three hundred) descriptions of Allah—to be exact.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">What should be most 
	startling is that all those Allahs (plural!) lived at different locations 
	but only within the boundaries of Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, 
	Babylonia and Iraq. Why should Allah choose only these places (Arab lands, 
	to say it bluntly) to live when the entire universe is His? This question is 
	not hard to answer when we figure out the depth of geographical knowledge of 
	those ancient Arabs, Sumerians and Babylonians. The fascinating point is: 
	having lived in those territories for many millenniums, Allah suddenly 
	changed His mind with the birth of Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. Islam 
	claims that Allah made Ka’ba 2 000 years before He created Adam (Ghazali, 
	1993, p. 1.190). There is evidence to suggest that Allah did, at least for a 
	while, live in Mecca. An inscription found during the digging of Ka’ba 
	foundation by Muhammad’s grandfather Abdal Muttalib read, “I am Allah, the 
	Lord of Bakka–” ( ibn Ishaq, 2001, p. 85).</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Having travelled through 
	all those desert lands, finally, when Allah learned about the birth of 
	Muhammad, He determined to settle permanently in Mecca, at Ka’ba, to be 
	specific. This should not surprise anyone. Because the other name of Ka’ba 
	is <i>Bait Allah</i> (Allah’s residence).<br>
	Therefore, it will be quite correct to say that Allah does have a permanent 
	physical abode (at least a temporary one) on earth, and it is Ka’ba. Every 
	year millions of Muslims travel to Ka’ba just for this reason—to meet Allah 
	in person, in the Ka’ba stone.</font></p>

	that here we are talking of Muhammad’s Allah. The Pagans of Arabia, for a 
	long time before Muhammad started his preaching, knew that Allah, along with 
	His consorts, daughters and companions lived in Mecca. What they could not 
	accept was Muhammad’s complete rejection of the associates of Allah, the 
	numerous idols which the Pagans believed interceded with Allah. Thus, they 
	betook Muhammad’s Allah as a new brand of God which they rejected out of 
	hand.</font></p>
