  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">On this day, 16th of December, many
  Bangalees are going to celebrate throughout the world our extremely costly
  freedom that we own from the brute Pakistani soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>There will be many functions, ceremonies and remembrances that may
  bring tears to many and smiles on many faces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In this brief recount, I am going to narrate to you some of the events
  that I saw with my own eyes and what I had experienced personally on that
  wintry day in 1971.&nbsp;</span></p>

                          <img border="0" src="../../Special_Event_/muktijodha_sm.jpg" width="565" height="337"></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">In the month of November and December
  1971, it was quite clear that the allied forces are going to win the war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In fact, towards the middle of November all stations of AIR were
  already giving the ultimatum to the Pakistani Army that they had no
  alternative but to surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  heard the speech given by the Indian force's chief General Sam Maneckshaw to
  that effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the
  Pakistan army never admitted their hapless situation and the Dhaka Radio
  predicted the eventual victory of Pakistan and the destruction of all the <i>Kafirs</i>
  and the <i>Munafiqs</i>. Very few Bangalees ever tuned to the broadcasting of
  the Pakistan radio knowing full well that those propagandas were nothing but a
  bunch of boloney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our most
  favourite radio station was the BBC and our most reliable person for accurate
  reporting was Mark Tally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
  were two sessions of the BBC Bengali service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>One was early in the morning and another one was at night.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess very few Bangalees ever missed any one of those
  sessions of the BBC. Therefore, the BBC was the heart and soul of the
  Bangalees in those turbulent times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
  will also never forget Serajur Rahman and Shyamal Lodh of BBC for their
  untiring, emotional and spirited reporting on the events in Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>For 24-hour news, everyone would tune to AIR whichever AIR
  station may be that (Calcutta, Delhi --- etc.).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We also heard the voice of Mrs. Indira Gandhi in the
  recognition of Bangladesh as a sovereign country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>These are the moments no Bangalees of my generation would ever forget
  and we will cherish these moments as long as we live in this mortal world.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Any way, by the end of November 1971,
  the Allied Air Force had the complete control of the azure sky of our
  homeland. Although there was curfew enforced for most of the day, very few
  people really bothered about that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People
  would venture out to nearby place for their shopping of their quotidian needs.
  Many people simply out of fear had dug trenches in their house compound for
  bomb shelter. However, most venturesome people preferred to go to their
  rooftops ignoring the danger that may come with it to watch the dogfight
  rather than going inside the trench to heave a sigh of relief. We had very
  little food to eat. But we were so happy that we forgot the food. I remember
  eating rice with only daal (lentil) and salt. But they even tasted so good!&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Just about a couple of weeks before
  the surrender of the Pakistan Army, the Indian airplanes dropped leaflets all
  around Dhaka (possibly all around Bangladesh too) in English, Urdu, and
  Bengali about the hopeless condition of the Pakistan Army and warned them of
  their consequences in the hands of the enraged Bangalee if they delay their
  surrender to the allied forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  leaflet also guaranteed the protection of the POW's (Prisoner Of War)
  according to the Geneva Convention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone
  could feel that war was coming to an end although all around Dhaka there were
  quite a few bombings by the Allied Air Force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Those bombings were strictly limited to the cantonment and airport
  area. There were very few civilian casualties due to those nonstop bombings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In fact, every one welcomed those bombings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>At night, we could hear constant barrage of machine gun fire and sounds
  of explosions. Those were the signs that our own <i>Muktibahini </i>freedom
  fighters are approaching to Dhaka and they will not let the Pakistani army go
  too easily.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Twenty-four hours before the
  surrender, there was a special announcement by all the stations of AIR that
  the Pakistan Army had decided to surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The official instrument of surrender ceremony will be held on the very
  place where Sheikh Mujib declared the freedom of Bangladesh almost nine months
  earlier on 7th.March, 1971. That is, the racecourse maidan. It was such an
  irony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The news of the surrender
  ceremony spread like a wildfire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quite
  predictably, the Pakistan Radio kept silence about the surrender ceremony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We got the confirmation of the surrender in the trembling but emotional
  voice of Serajur Rahman of BBC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  cannot describe my feeling (and the feeling of all the Bangalees) with that
  piece of news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We could not sleep
  the whole night waiting to witness the surrender ceremony in racecourse maidan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The AIR also warned people not to harm any retreating Pakistani soldier
  by shooting, throwing stones, etc. If anyone were caught doing that, he would
  be dealt with severely by the allied command. The announcement said that if
  any Bangalee finds any Pakistani soldier who is injured or in any way invalid
  then he must be taken to the nearest hospital or to the allied command
  immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With those
  announcements the allied force was able to restrain any desire by the
  Bangalees to take the revenge on Pakistani soldiers who were all but
  demoralized on that very day.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">At around 1.00 P.M of 16th December
  1971 we (my younger brother and I) started walking from our home at Lalbagh to
  the racecourse maidan. The surrender ceremony was scheduled for the late
  afternoon may be around 3:00 to 4.00 P.M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>When we came to the street, we saw throngs of people. People and
  people, people everywhere in the street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>For a moment I thought it was like another March 7th.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We saw many <i>Mukti </i>soldiers in plain clothes but with small
  machine guns hanging by their shoulder. People were simply hugging and kissing
  them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For one Mukti boy there
  were hundreds of people waiting just to touch him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>How may I forget those unforgettable scenes!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When we came near the medical college, we were surprised to
  see a column of Pakistani soldiers walking on foot with their automatic rifles
  on their shoulders. We also saw a person injured with gunshot lying on the
  street and a few people trying to carry him to the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We heard from them that the injured person threw some stones
  at the retreating columns of the Pakistani soldiers and they had no choice but
  use their rifles to protect themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
  far as I know, this was the only case of attack at the retreating soldiers by
  the Bangalees. It is really surprising how the Bangalees resisted their
  temptation to take their revenge on the retreating Pakistani soldiers after
  what these brutes have done to us in the last nine-month period. We followed
  to the letter the directives given by the allied forces concerning our fallen
  enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All Bangalees should
  remember this gentle and forgiving nature of ours.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">We finally made it to the racecourse
  at around 2.30 P.M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The area was
  already crowded with people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  saw a huge convoy of Indian soldiers who had surrounded the area where the
  surrender ceremony was about to be held.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We were quite lucky to find a place very close to the ceremony site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Everyone was hugging and kissing each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It was as if every one was born again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I saw that a few tables and chairs had already been placed where the
  ceremony was to take place. A few Indian army officers were sitting there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I saw General Jagjit Singh Aurora sitting at the centre chair. Other
  few army officers with many stars flanked him on both sides.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I guessed they must be some Brigadiers and Maj. Generals of Indian
  army. The Pakistani General A.A.K Niazi had not arrived yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Everyone was anxiously waiting for him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Many people chanted slogans like Joi Bangla, Joi Sheikh Mujib, Joi
  Indira, Joi Aurora, etc. These were impromptu slogans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I did not hear any slogan condemning Niazi and his actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>People were simply overwhelmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
  had forgotten the hate. They simply wanted to celebrate their victory for once
  and all.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">After about 20 minutes, an army jeep
  arrived at the site. It was the jeep that brought General Niazi and some of
  his Lieutenants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>General Aurora
  and his men stood up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I saw
  General Niazi and General Aurora saluted each other in <i>chost </i>military
  fashion. Then General Niazi took his revolver out of his holster and put it on
  the table. This, of course was a symbolic act. The two Generals then shook
  hands and to our great surprise they hugged each other. It was just
  unbelievable!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I never expected
  that to happen!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I thought I saw
  both the Generals eyes were wet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
  the gestures of General Niazi suggested that at last he was relieved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I thought that General Niazi was simply happy to surrender to the
  Indian army rather than dying in the hands of the <i>Mukti</i> boys. At last,
  he was on the hands of the professional soldiers who will ensure his safety
  and survival as per the Geneva Convention.&nbsp;</span></p>

  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Then we saw General Aurora requested
  General Niazi to sit beside him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  two Generals then chit chatted while exchanging pleasantry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>At times we even saw them laughing a little bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Then another Indian army officer brought some papers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I saw General Niazi sign on one of those papers first. Then General
  Aurora signed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both the Generals
  then stood up, saluted each other and hugged one more time. There was a
  thunderous clapping and cheers from the crowd.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Those were very very poignant moments for those who witnessed the
  scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Then we saw General Aurora ushered General Niazi in his (Gen.
  Aurora) military jeep. The two Generals then drove off the racecourse ground
  leaving the winter dust composed of mostly dead grass and fallen leaves. The
  surrender ceremony thus ended abruptly without any fanfare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It was really a very brief ceremony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>No pomp and circumstances to speak about. Everyone then started heading
  home.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">When we arrived home at around
  5.00P.M, we heard three chilling news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  first news was the death of Pintoo, our next-door neighbour at the hands of
  the Razakars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We went to his
  house to hear the details.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pintoos
  younger brother Montoo told us that both the brothers (Pintoo and Montoo) were
  taken away on the 9<sup>th</sup> December by a few sweet-talking Razakers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>They were held captive along with many other young students and some
  elderly people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were kept in
  a dark and dingy room and tortured regularly. The Razakars branded them as
  enemies of Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They wanted to
  know the whereabouts of many <i>Mukti </i>boys who were their friends and
  classmates. I saw the torture marks in Montoos body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I also saw a deep cut on his shoulder and his swollen eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Montoo then told us that the Razakars killed his brother (Pintoo) in
  front of him by shooting him in his head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The Razakars then warned to kill him (Montoo) too if he did not tell
  the whereabouts of his <i>Mukti </i>friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The Razakars also told him of theirs (Razakars) grand plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The plan was to kill all the University going students in Bangladesh
  before the Indian soldiers could enter the city of Dhaka.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>They even showed him an endless list of people they had targeted to
  eliminate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, Montoo
  managed to escape his captors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
  he did that is another story to tell.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The second piece of chilling news was
  the missing of Dr. Fazle Rabbi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
  house was just stones throw from our house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Dr. Rabbi was picked up from our area on the same night as Montoo and
  Pintoo were picked up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Montoo
  told us that Dr. Rabbi was tortured along with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>One day, the Razakars took Dr. Rabbi to another room and shot him right
  there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Montoo did not know what
  the Razakars did with Dr. Rabbi's dead body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We went to Dr. Rabbi's house to express our sorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>His wife was crying.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">I saw his brother typing a letter,
  stoically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guessed it was
  addressed to the UN Secretary General or something like that.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">The third chilling news was the
  kidnapping of my closest friend Badiul Alam who was the President of EPSU of
  the Ahsanullah Hall of EPUET (now BUET).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>He and I were also covertly involved with provision of financial and
  logistic support to our Mukti boys. Eyewitnesses told me that on the 13th of
  December 1971 a few people came in a jeep and told Badiul that they had some
  good news to give him about the <i>Mukti Bahini</i> and requested Badiul to
  join them in their jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of
  my friends told me that those people were members of the Islami Chatra Sangha
  of EPUET. I am not one hundred percent sure, though. Until today, no one knows
  what happened to Badiul. I am certain that his skeleton is in one of the mass
  graves that have been found all around Bangladesh.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU">Thus, I ended the 16th December 1971
  mostly with personal sadness, with some grief and a little bit of joy knowing
  that we have a separate homeland call Bangla Desh (yes, it was spelled that
  way throughout the turbulent days of nine month period).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I never knew that one day I would be asked by someone whom I
  met very recently in the cyber space to write about this day for posterity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Lest we forget, it was the day that engendered a new beginning for 75
  million proud people who call them Bangalees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We were told that this new nation is going to be a secular nation for
  all people irrespective of who is Christian, Buddhist, Hindus, and yes,
  Muslim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But after 31 long years,
  what do we see in the horizon?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever
  happened to our call for secularism?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
  did Bangladesh abandon the cherish goal of our founding fathers?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Isnt it a real betrayal?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
  are the mixed feeling that I have in this auspicious moment.</span></p>
