  <p class="MsoNormal">So at long last, Brigadier General (Retd) Syed
  Ashrafuzzaman admitted that there is no science in the holy <i>Qur’an</i>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">(<a href="http://www.vinnomot.com/Dhaka/AsrafQuranSC.htm">http://www.vinnomot.com/Dhaka/AsrafQuranSC.htm</a>).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">( <a href="http://www.shodalap.com/Quran_Science.htm">http://www.shodalap.com/Quran_Science.htm</a>
  )</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Bravo Mr. Brigadier General. You gave the <i>‘Harami’</i>
  secularists and repugnant <i>‘Muktomonas’</i> a signal victory, no doubt.
  It had taken us a long time to have such a laurel. Naturally, we should be
  happy about your sudden change of mind, but wait; before we claim victory I
  must clear certain cobwebs from the mind of a Military General who views world
  only wearing a colored glass of Islam.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Why is it that whenever the secularists and the
  rationalists criticize the religious scriptures, especially the <i>Qur’an</i>
  for advocating science in them, Military Generals, with Islamic garb suddenly
  become furious to acknowledge that it is futile to discover science in the <i>Qur’an</i>.
  In his own language the retired Brigadier General quipped, “Therefore,
  people like Mr. Avijit can be well advised not to look for scientific theories
  in the <i>Qur’an</i>.” What a great admission of defeat in logic! Why
  should not a person like Avijit search science in the <i>Qur’an</i>, may I
  ask such a question to you, Mr. Ashrafuzzaman? Have you heard of Dr. Maurice
  Bucaille, Mr. Brigadier. General? Have you read his book on science in the <i>Qur’an</i>.
  If this ‘quack’ scientist could discover plenty of science in the <i>Qur’an</i>,
  even to the extent of saying that he could not find anything in the <i>Qur’an</i>
  that is unscientific, then why not a trained engineer with vast knowledge and
  experience in scientific matters dig <i>Qur’an</i> and prove him otherwise?
  Why is it that when the charlatan occidental/oriental scientists discover so
  called science in the <i>Qur’an</i> the Islamists do not object by saying
  that ‘it is futile to discover science in the <i>Qur’an</i>?’ Is it fair
  for a retired Military General to practice such a double standard? Is this
  what Islam teaches to practice—impugn your opponent with epithets whenever
  you cannot confront him with logic and rationality?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Brigadier General Ashrafuzzaman then went on with his
  diatribe and harangued the likes of Avijit and <i>‘Muktomonas’</i> to
  refrain from delving in to <i>Qur’anic</i> matters else he will ‘expose
  the motive.’ What motive are you talking about, Mr. Ashrafuzzaman? You mean
  all of those who criticize Islam and <i>Qur’an</i>, <i>Hadis</i>, <i>Sharia</i>….etc
  are paid agents of India, RAW, Jews, CIA…etc.?&nbsp; If that is the case,
  then please count me as an agent of India and the Jews Axis.&nbsp; Is there
  anything wrong in becoming a stooge and a paid sleuth of these infidels when
  there are thousands of <i>M</i>a<i>drassa/Taliban </i>factories in Bangladesh,
  Pakistan, etc.? How about that Mr. Ashrafuzzaman?&nbsp; Are not the <i>Murids</i>
  of these <i>Islamic Industries</i> fed, clothed and trained by Saudi Arabia,
  the keeper of Islam to slaughter the infidels and the secularists?&nbsp; If
  someone can be the paid agent of Pakistan, and ISI, then why is it so wrong to
  be the paid agent of India and RAW. Further more, if someone can be a paid
  agent of Pakistan and ISI, then why is it wrongful to be the paid agent of
  India and RAW? Oh, come on Mr. Ashrafuzzaman; show some fairness, won’t you?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Brigadier General Ashrafuzzaman then had a prolix
  discourse on the translation, interpretation, infallibility, and the complete
  immutability of the <i>Qur’an</i>. He found all the translations (especially
  Bengali translations) are incorrect, if not down right wrong, except perhaps
  for the translation by Yusuf Ali, whom he found suitable for some selected
  verses that he (the Brigadier General) himself decided to pick. How funny!
  Brigadier General, you know how much mastery in Islam and the languages are
  required to be a translator of a religious scripture? How could you simply
  dismiss eminent translators including Maulana Muhiuddin as unreliable?&nbsp;
  You yourself claim that you do not know Arabic at all. Then, how do you know
  that Maulana Muhiuddin is wrong and Yusuf Ali is correct? In my opinion, Yusuf
  Ali’s translation is the most corrupt.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Simply, because he
  had translated the <i>Qur’an</i> for the Western readers of the <i>Qur’an</i>
  and the Western audience do not like any anti-woman and/or anti-humanist view.&nbsp;
  That is why Yusuf Ali had many insertions in brackets to placate the western
  readers of the <i>Qur’an</i>. Muslim’s Holy Scriptures, in its raw form
  are much more anti-woman, violent, barbaric and intolerant.&nbsp; If you think
  I am exaggerating, then get a transliteration of the <i>Qur’an,</i> get an
  Arabic dictionary, and judge for yourself. You will surely notice that what
  Maulana Muhiuddin had translated as to the provision of supply of women in
  paradise is completely correct. Yusuf Ali simply made it more palatable to the
  western readers by selectively choosing the ‘spouse’ instead of ‘women
  purified.’ In the same vein, I would now request you to prove to me that in
  the original <i>Qur’an,</i> in verse <b>4:34</b> there is a bracket that
  says (lightly) to beat one’s wife.&nbsp; Please do it to prove that you have
  the slightest fairness in you.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Brigadier General Ashrafuzzaman, then brought up many
  irrelevant matters that had very little to do with the title of his essay,
  viz., “COMMENTS ON “THE QUR’AN &amp; SCIENCE.”&nbsp; He brought up the
  topic of quoting the <i>Qur’an</i> ‘out of context,’ as if we are such a
  bunch of doltish people that we do not understand this idea. This is a very
  old broken record that Mr. Ashrafuzzaman is playing now. We have heard this <i>ad</i>
  <i>infinitum</i> and I have personally penned many rebuttals on this matter.
  Just to let you know, Brigadier General Ashrafuzzaman, that whenever we write
  any essay that delves in to Islam and <i>Qur’an</i>, we take extreme caution
  to inscribe a single word that we are not absolutely certain is correct.&nbsp;
  If you like to test my contention, then I would like you to search the
  archives of Vinnomot or NFB or FFI, take one of my articles that criticized <i>Qur’an</i>,
  read it thoroughly and prove to me that what I wrote was wrong, incorrect,
  illogical, and most of all, out of context.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Brigadier General Ashrafuzzaman’s essay does not really
  deserve a rebuttal. The reason why I wrote this short rejoinder is that I was
  deeply appalled at the vehement diatribe, personal attack and impugn that he
  has hurled on Avijit Roy. Besides using completely inappropriate language to
  describe Avijit’s scholarship, he shamelessly wrote:&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoBodyText2">“For him it is tactically inconvenient to
    criticize Islam while claiming himself to be a Hindu. In the garb of an
    atheist he can enjoy more freedom to criticize the Qur’an to prove that it
    is not the Words of Allah, it is a man made book full of mistakes and
    controversies.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Brigadier General. Ashrafuzzaman, why are you claiming
  that Avijit writes essays that are critical of Islam only? In his article,
  “Bigganmoy Kitab” he has vehemently criticized Hinduism and Christianity
  as well. Why don’t you assess his work in all fairness? How about SKM?&nbsp;
  How about fatemolla? How about Muhammad Asghar? How about Dr Ali Sina?&nbsp;
  How about Mughal? ……..Why don’t you dare to hurl your epithets to them?&nbsp;
  Is it not because you think that Avijit belongs to a minority community and
  you, being an ex-Military General can easily silence him with your
  ‘martial’ command?&nbsp; To show your petulant military temper, I shall
  quote from your essay once again. This is what you wrote regarding Avijit Roy:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">“He has
    only one motive, as set by his masters, in doing so. For all true Muslims
    the Qur’an is the only source of strength. Ninety percent of the people of
    Bangladesh being Muslims derive their national strength from the Qur’an.
    If their faith in the Qur’an can be shaken by writing articles like
    “Bigganmoy Kitab” Bangladesh will become a weaker state. In a situation
    like that the masters of Mr. Avijit will be very happy and more eager to
    patronize him and his cohorts with more resources. But by the grace of Allah
    that is not going to happen. Baraibari stands as a proof to that.”</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Is
  this the language you have learned in the Military Academy of Bangladesh or
  Pakistan?&nbsp; No wonder you are a total waste of taxpayer’s money. If this
  is the kind of Military General Bangladesh produces then I wish good luck to
  Bangladesh. Perhaps we are better off without having an army at all. You only
  know how to kill and torment the weaker sections of Bangladesh community as
  you have learned this skill from your Pakistan masters (like Yahya Khan).
  Pardon me for my acerbic language: it was tit for tat.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Are
  you hurt now, Mr. Brigadier General?&nbsp; Of course you are. This is exactly
  how a minority in Bangladesh feels when he/she reads (your) above statement.
  Calm down General!&nbsp; Don’t act like the proverbial Chicken Little
  thinking that the world is coming to an abrupt end because a solitary Bangalee
  writer has shown in the Net quite a few inanities in the <i>Qur’an</i>.&nbsp;
  It’s easy to find vacuity all over <i>Qur’an</i>.&nbsp; You just have to
  look for it.&nbsp; Oh, one more point, you have to remove your blindfold.&nbsp;
  Are you now ready to take the plunge?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
