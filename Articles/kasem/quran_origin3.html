    <p>An afterthought: After the posting of Part 2 of this series, some readers
    requested me to elicit the verses of Zayd b. Amr’s poems which I mentioned
    in <a href="quran_origin2.htm">Part 2</a>. I wrote that those verses have
    uncanny similarities with some Qur’anic verses. Previously, I did not
    quote those verses just to keep the length of this essay short and not to
    bore the readers (as well as not to break the copyright laws). Here are some
    sample verses from Zayd’s poem. For more details please refer to ibn Ishaq’s
    biography of Muhammad (see bibliography).---Abul Kasem<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Ibn Ishaq (pp.100-101)</b></p>
    <p>Zayd b. ‘Amr. B. Nufayl composed the following poem about leaving his
    people and the torment he received from them:</p>
    <p>Am I to worship one lord or a thousand?<br>
    If there are as many as you claim,<br>
    I renounce al-Lat and al-‘Uzza both of them<br>
    As any strong-minded person would.<br>
    I will not worship al-‘Uzza and her two daughters,<br>
    Nor will I visit the two images of the Banu ‘Amr.<br>
    I will not worship Hubal’ though he was our lord<br>
    In the days when I had little sense.<br>
    I wondered (for in the night much is strange<br>
    Which in daylight is plain to the discerning),<br>
    That God had annihilated many men<br>
    Whose deeds were thoroughly evil<br>
    And spared others through the piety of a people<br>
    So that a little child could grow in manhood.<br>
    A man may languish for a time and then recover<br>
    As the branch of a tree revives after the rain.<br>
    I serve my Lord the compassionate<br>
    That the forgiving Lord may pardon my sin,<br>
    So keep to the fear of God your Lord;<br>
    While you hold to that you will not perish.<br>
    You will see the pious living in gardens,<br>
    While for the infidels hell fire is burning.<br>
    Shamed in life, when they die<br>
    Their breasts will contract in anguish.</p>
    <p><b>Zayd also said: (143)</b></p>
    <p>To God I give my praise and thanksgiving,<br>
    A sure word that will not fail as long as time lasts,<br>
    To the heavenly King—there is no God beyond Him<br>
    And no lord can draw near to Him.<br>
    Beware, O men, of what follows death!<br>
    You can hide nothing from God..<br>
    Beware of putting another beside God,<br>
    For the upright way has become clear.<br>
    Merry I implore, others trust in jinn,<br>
    But thou, my God, art our Lord and our hope.<br>
    I am satisfied with thee, O God, as a Lord,<br>
    And will not worship another God beside thee.<br>
    Thou of thy goodness and mercy<br>
    Didst send a messenger to Moses as a herald.<br>
    Thou saidst to him, Go thou and Aaron,<br>
    And summon Pharaoh the tyrant to run to God<br>
    And say to him, ‘Did you spread out this (earth) without support,<br>
    Until it stood fast as it does?’<br>
    Say to him ‘Did you raise this (heaven) without support?<br>
    What a fine builder then you were!’<br>
    Say to him ‘Did you set the moon in the middle thereof<br>
    As a light to guide when night covered it?’<br>
    Say to him, ‘Who sent forth the sun by day<br>
    So that the earth it touched reflected its splendour?’<br>
    Say to him, ‘Who planted seeds in the dust<br>
    That herbage might grow and wax great?<br>
    And brought forth its seeds in the head of the plant?’<br>
    Therein are signs for the understanding.<br>
    Thou in thy kindness did deliver Jonah<br>
    Who spent nights in the belly of the fish.<br>
    Though I glorify thy name, I often repeat<br>
    ‘O Lord of creatures, bestow thy gifts and mercy upon me<br>
    And bless my sons and property.</p>
    <p>[(143) Ibn Hisham’s note (ibn Ishaq p.713): These verses really belong
    to an ode of Umayya b. Abu’l-Salt, except for the first two, the fifth,
    and the last verse. The second half of the first verse does not come via I.I.]</p>
    <p>Here is another sample verse of Zayd b. Amr (ibn Ishaq, p.102):</p>
    <p>And <b>Zayd said:</b></p>
    <p>I submit myself to him to whom<br>
    The earth which bears mighty rocks is subject.<br>
    He spread it out and when He saw it was settled<br>
    Upon the waters, He fixed the mountains on it.<br>
    I submit myself to Him to whom clouds which bear<br>
    Sweet water are subject<br>
    When they are borne along to a land<br>
    They obediently pour copious rain upon it.</p>
    <p>After Zayd b. Amr was killed, his comrade Waraqa b. Naufal b. Asad (i.e.,
    Khadijah’s cousin brother) composed this elegy over him (ibn Ishaq,
    p.103):</p>
    <p>You were altogether on the right path Ibm ‘Amr,<br>
    You have escaped hell’s burning oven<br>
    By serving the one and only God<br>
    And abandoning vain idols.<br>
    And by attaining the religion which you sought<br>
    Not being unmindful of the unity of your Lord<br>
    You have reached a noble dwelling<br>
    Wherein you will rejoice in your generous treatment.<br>
    You will meet there the friend of God, (3)<br>
    Since you were not a tyrant ripe for hell,<br>
    For the mercy of God reaches men,<br>
    Though they be seventy valleys deep below the earth (146)</p>
    <p>Footnote (3): The district of which ‘Amman was the capital. Ibn Hisham’s
    note (146): The first two verses of this poem are attributed to Umayya b.
    Abu al-Salt and the last verse occurs in one of his odes. The words ‘vain
    idols’ have not I.I..’a authority.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">[The reason of my quoting the elegy of
    Waraqa is to demonstrate the strong camaraderie between Zayd b. Amr and
    Waraqa which had propelled Muhammad to develop a deep respect and
    appreciation of what Zayd b. Amr sincerely believed, resolutely stood and
    eventually died for. He was determined to emulate Zayd b. Amr, the great
    confidante’ of Waraqa and hence Khadijah. Remember? Khadijah was Muhammad’s
    first wife and his only support.---Abul Kasem]<b><span lang="EN-AU" style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">&nbsp;</span></b></p>

    <h3><b><font size="5">Hasan b. Thabit</font></b></h3>
    <p>Hasan b. Thabit was Muhammad’s own official poet. He wrote the Diwan,
    the anthology of ancient Arabian poetry. When Muhammad migrated to Medina he
    made Hasan b. Thabit his own poet. Nonetheless, Hasan b. Thabit had his
    idiosyncrasies. Even though he was the personal poet of Muhammad he had a
    deep dislike for the Muslims. On page xxviii of Sirat Rasul Allah, the
    translator, Professor Alfred Guillaume writes, “Hasan b. Thabit disliked
    the growing number of Muslims. He considered the vagrant Muslims as
    unmitigated nuisance. He did not house any of the Muhajirin, nor was a
    brother to one of them.”</p>
    <p>Most likely, Hasan b. Thabit was a hired poet (a kind of journalist) of
    Muhammad—paid to compose poetry as per Muhammad’s specifications. This
    can be confirmed from Ahadith. Here are some examples:</p>
    <p><i>From Sahih Bukhari: Muhammad approved Hassan b. Thabit to recite
    poetry in a mosque…4.54.434</i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 434: </b>Narrated Sa'id bin Al-Musaiyab: 'Umar
      came to the Mosque while Hassan was reciting a poem. ('Umar disapproved of
      that). On that Hassan said, &quot;I used to recite poetry in this very
      Mosque in the presence of one (i.e. the Prophet ) who was better than
      you.&quot; Then he turned towards Abu Huraira and said (to him), &quot;I
      ask you by Allah, did you hear Allah's Apostle saying (to me),
      &quot;Retort on my behalf. O Allah! Support him (i.e. Hassan) with the
      Holy Spirit?&quot; Abu Huraira said, &quot;Yes.&quot; This Hadis,
      unmistakably shows that Hasan used to construct poems for Muhammad to be
      recited in the mosque. Can those poems not be some of the Suras of the Qur’an?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i>Muhammad instructed Hassan, the poet to lampoon the pagans…4.54.435</i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 435: </b>Narrated Al Bara: The Prophet
      said to Hassan, &quot;Lampoon them (i.e. the pagans) and Gabriel is with
      you.&quot; This Hadis demonstrates that Hasan b. Thabit used to compose
      poems as per Muhammad’s likes and dislikes—just the way the Qur’an
      is composed of Allah’s revelations via Gabriel. Hassan b. Thabit
      lampooned the infidels excluding Muhammad…4.56.731 Volume 4, Book 56,
      Number 731: Narrated 'Aisha: Once Hassan bin Thabit asked the permission
      of the Prophet to lampoon (i.e. compose satirical poetry defaming) the
      infidels. The Prophet said, &quot;What about the fact that I have common
      descent with them?&quot; Hassan replied, &quot;I shall take you out of
      them as a hair is taken out of dough.&quot; Narrated 'Urwa: I started
      abusing Hassan in front of 'Aisha, whereupon she said. &quot;Don't abuse
      him, for he used to defend the Prophet (with his poetry).&quot; Here are
      further evidence that Hasan b. Thabit was a paid scribe—a Qur’an
      composer of Muhammad Muhammad asked his poet Hassan to abuse the B.
      Qurayzah Jews through his poetry...Sahih Bukhari: 5.59.449</p>
      <p><b>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 449: </b>Narrated Al-Bara: The Prophet
      said to Hassan, &quot;Abuse them (with your poems), and Gabriel is with
      you (i.e, supports you).&quot; (Through another group of sub narrators)
      Al-Bara bin Azib said, &quot;On the day of Quraiza's (besiege), Allah's
      Apostle said to Hassan bin Thabit, 'Abuse them (with your poems), and
      Gabriel is with you (i.e. supports you).' &quot; This Hadis demonstrates
      further that Muhammad commissioned Hasan b. Thabit to compose poems as per
      his stipulations.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>Sahih Muslim</b></p>
    <p><i>Abu Talha gave his valuable property to his relatives, viz. Hassan b.
    Thabit and Ubayy b. Ka’b…5.2186</i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Book 005, Number 2186:</b> Anas reported that when this verse was
      revealed:&quot; You will not attain righteousness till you give freely of
      what you love,&quot; Abu Talha said: I see that our Lord has demanded from
      us out of our property; so I make you a witness, Messenger of Allah. that
      I give my land known as Bairaha' for the sake of Allah. Upon this the
      Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Give that to your
      relatives. So he gave it to Hassan b. Thabit and Ubayy b. Ka'b. That was
      how Muhammad rewarded Hasan b. Thabit for composing Qur’anic verses (via
      his poems, and helped by Gabriel) for Muhammad.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><i>After Hassan b. Thabit went blind he used to spend time at Aisha’s
    quarter. Aisha admired him as he used to write satirical rebuttal on be half
    of Muhammad…31.6077</i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Book 031, Number 6077: </b>Masruq reported: I visited 'A'isha when
      Hassin was sitting there and reciting verses from his compilation: She is
      chaste and prudent. There is no calumny against her and she rises up early
      in the morning without eating the meat of the un- mindful. 'A'isha said:
      But you are not so. Masruq said: I said to her: Why do you permit him to
      visit you, whereas Allah has said:&quot; And as for him among them who
      took upon himself the main part thereof, he shall have a grievous
      punishment&quot; (XXIV. ll)? Thereupon she said: What tornient can be more
      severe than this that he has become blind? He used to write satire as a
      rebuttal on behalf of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). That was
      how Hasan b. Thabit saved Muhammad and his Qur’an!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Here is another Hadis from Sahih Muslim that even claims that <i>Hasan b.
    Thabit’s poems were helped by divine power (Ruh-ul-Quddus) and were
    similar to certain Qur’anic verses:</i></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Book 031, Number 6081:</b> 'A'isha reported that Allah's Messenger
      (may peace be uport him) said. Satirise against the (non-believing amongst
      the) Quraish, for (the satire) is more grievous to them than the hurt of
      an arrow. So he (the Holy Prophet) sent (someone) to Ibn Rawiha and asked
      him to satirise against them, and he composed a satire, but it did not
      appeal to him (to the Holy Prophet). He then sent (someone) to Ka'b b.
      Malik (to do the same, but what he composed did not appeal to the Holy
      Prophet). He then sent one to Hassan b. Thabit. As he got into his
      presence, Hassan said: Now you have called for this lion who strikes (the
      enemies) with his tail. He then brought out his tongue and began to move
      it and said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall tear them with my
      tongue as the leather is torn. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be
      upon him) said: Don't be hasty; (let) Abu Bakr who has the best know-
      ledge of the lineage of the Quraish draw a distinction for you in regard
      to my lineage, as my lineage is thesame as theirs. Hassan then came to him
      (Abu Bakr) and after making inquiry (in regard to the lineage of the Holy
      Prophet) came back to him (the holy Prophet) and said: Allah's Messenger,
      he (Abu Bakr) has drawn a distinction in vour lineage (and that of the
      Quraish) By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall draw out from them
      (your name) as hair is drawn out from the flour. 'A'isha said: I heard
      Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying to Hassin: Verily
      Ruh-ul- Qudus would continue to help you so long as you put up a defence
      on behalf of Allah and His Messenger. And she said: I heard Allah's
      Messenger (may peace be upon him) saying: Hassan satirised against them
      and gave satisfaction to the (Muslims) and disquieted (the non-Muslims).
      You satirised Muhammad, but I replied on his behalf, And there is reward
      with Allah for this. You satirised Muhammad. virtuous, righteous, The
      Apostle of Allah, whose nature is truthfulness. So verily my father and
      his father and my honour Are a protection to the honour of Muhammad; May I
      lose my dear daughter, if you don't see her, Wiping away the dust from the
      two sides of Kada', They pull at the rein, going upward; On their
      shoulders are spears thirsting (for the blood of the enemy) ; our steeds
      are sweating-our women wipe them with their mantles. If you had not
      interfered with us, we would have performed the 'Umra, And (then) there
      was the Victory, and the darkness cleared away. Otherwise wait for the
      fighting on the day in which Allah will honour whom He pleases. And Allah
      said: I have sent a servant who says the Truth in which there is no
      ambiguity; And Allah said: I have prepared an army-they are the Ansar
      whose object is fighting (the enemy), There reaches every day from Ma'add
      abuse, or fighting or satire; Whoever satirises the Apostle from amongst
      you, or praises him and helps it is all the same, And Gabriel, the Apostle
      of Allah is among us, and the Holy Spirit who has no match. Muhammad
      rewarded this mercenary poet of him by awarding him a pretty, young damsel
      Sirin, who, along with Marriyah Kibtia was presented to Muhammad by
      Muyaqis, the then governor of Alexandria. Muhammad kept for himself
      Marriyah, the prettiest lass and donated Sirin to Hasan b. Thabit to be
      used as his sex-slave. Ibn Ishaq (Ibn Ishaq, p.652) writes that Sirin and
      Marriyah were sisters.</p>

    <h3><font size="5"><b>Salman the Persian</b></font></h3>
    <p>Salman, the Persian was originally a devout Zoroastrian from Isfahan,
    Persia. Then he converted to Christianity. Later, he was sold as a slave to
    a B. Qurayza Jew of Medina. When Muhammad arrived at Medina Salman met him
    there. Some 3 years later, with the help of Muslims he purchased his freedom
    from his master and converted to Islam--becoming an ardent companion of
    Muhammad. During the battle of Ahzab (the battle of the ditch) the trench
    digging was his idea. He was well acquainted with the books of the Persians
    (i.e., Zoroastrianism), the Greeks and the Jews. Ali said about him
    (Reliance of the Traveller, p.1093), “He was a man of us and for us, the
    line of prophetic house, and in relation to you as the sage Luqman, having
    learned the first knowledge and the last, read the first scripture and the
    last: an exhaustive sea.”</p>
    <p>Undoubtedly, Muhammad cleverly utilised Salman’s extraordinary talent
    to compose many verses of the Qur’an that deal with historical tales of
    the ancient Egypt, the Greek, the Romans and the Persians. As Salman was
    formerly a Zoroastrian, Muhammad learned, in detail many of their beliefs
    and practices and incorporated them in his Qur’an. Muhammad’s
    description of Paradise and hell are stunningly similar to that of the
    Zoroastrians. So those verses dealing with the punishment in Hell and the
    prize in Paradise were surely contributed by Salman, the Persian. It is
    interesting to note that Salman became a close member of Muhammad’s
    family. Aisha reports that Muhammad used to spend countless hours with him--
    discussing various religious issues, so much so, that Aisha thought that
    Salman would spend the night with Muhammad.</p>
    <p>Those who have read the Qur’an up close—many times, will be
    profoundly surprised with Muhammad’s absolute pre-occupation with the
    description of Paradise and hell. There are many verses in the Qura’an
    that, time after time, deal with this particular topic—that is, the purely
    sensual rewards of Paradise for the believers and the sadistic, odious
    punishment for the unbelievers. Most of these verses, no doubt, were
    inspired by Salman, the Persian and later, written down by Muhammad’s
    scribes at his dictate—passing them up as Allah’s revelations. Here I am
    citing just a few of such verses. To save space I have cited only the main
    message in the verse. For details please refer to the verse number quoted.</p>
    <p>The Qur’anic Paradise If the believers do not commit the most heinous
    (major sin) of the forbidden (idolatry) then God will forgive other sins and
    admit them in paradise...4:31 The believers will have easy life and will

    sustenance (in paradise), fruits, honor, dignity, garden of felicity, they

    fountain, crystal white delicious drink, no headache, no intoxication,
    chaste women…36:41-50 In paradise there will be every kind of fruit and
    there will be peace and security...44:55 There will be no taste of death in
    paradise for the believers except their first death...44:56 Slain Jihadists
    will be in paradise…47:6 God will readily offer paradise to the believers…50:31
    Near the boundary of Lote tree is the paradise…53:15 Class3 Those nearest

    garden in paradise is the width of heaven and earth...57:21 If you repent
    then God will remove ills and send you to paradise under which rivers flow;
    the believers’ light will radiate in front of them and on to their right
    side...66:8 God will reward the righteous with a garden (paradise) and
    garments of silk will be theirs for their patience...76:12 The believers
    will recline in garden (paradise) on raised thrones, no excessive heat of
    the sun; no excessive cold of the moon...76:13 The residents of paradise
    will enjoy wine mixed with Zaanzabil (zinger?)…76:17 The fountain in
    paradise is called Salsabil...76:18 Passed around will be vessels of silver

    freshness like pearls...76:19 There will be peace and tranquillity
    everywhere in paradise…76:20 Green garments of fine silk and heavy
    brocade, adorned with bracelets of silver; God will give everyone to drink a
    pure holy wine...76:21</p>
    <p>And the Qur’anic Hell The preachers of idolatry will be cut off from
    their followers and will be sent to hell...2:166 God casts terror in the
    hearts of unbelievers; they will reside in hell...3:151 Hell is a woeful
    refuge...3:162 The dwellers of hell will be covered with shame; there are no

    Unbelievers will be cast in fire, their skins roasted often, skin changed
    often for more roasting...4:56 The unbelievers will drink boiling water in
    hell...6:70 Each new entrant of hell will blame his ancestors for leading

    than cattle...7:179 The unbelievers will burn in hell...14:29 There are
    seven gates in hell each of special class...15:44 Hell is a prison (dungeon)
    for the unbelievers...17:8 When someone wants material things, God will
    bestow this first; then He will gather them in Gehenna (hell) to be burnt
    forever)...17:18 Unbelievers will be lying face down, will be dumb and deaf
    on the judgment day; God will increase the fierceness of hell fire...17:97
    Hell is an entertainment for the unbelievers...18:102 Those who are gathered
    in hell will lay face down...25:34 Zaqqum, the bitter tree in hell is for
    the unbelievers…37:62 Zaqqum springs out of bottom of hell fire…37:64
    The unbelievers will be led to hell in crowds; gates will be opened, the
    keepers will ask questions regarding the messengers sent…39:71 The people
    of Pharaoh will be brought in front of hellfire in the morning and in the
    evening...40:46 Those in hellfire will beg the keepers of hell to lighten
    the penalty at least for a day...40:49 The keepers of hell will admonish the
    inmates of hell for disobeying the messengers sent to them while they were

    and pus…69:35-37 To escape hell fire, the sinners will offer to sacrifice
    their children, wives, brothers.....everything on earth; but these will not
    be acceptable to Allah, and the fire will be plucking out right to the
    skull...70:11-16 Non-Muslim Jinns and the idolaters will be the fuels of
    hell fire...72:15 Hellfire changes skin colour...74:27-29 For the
    disbelievers, Allah has prepared shackles, chains and a blazing hellfire…76:4
    No coolness and drink in hell (gehenna)...78:24</p>
    <p>For brevity’s sake I did not include the historical references in the
    Qur’an that were undoubtedly told to Muhammad by Salman. Please spend some
    time searching the Qur’an and you will surely discover that they were
    purely man-made stories—not the stories told by Allah.</p>
