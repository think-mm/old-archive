	<p>Dear moderator; </p>
	<p>Although this message, strictly speaking, is meant for BN forum, I am 
	posting it at VM as there are important information on beating women as 
	prescribed in Islam. I hope you will post this message for all to learn 
	something new--that they, probably had not heard before. </p>
	<p>Abul Kasem </p>
	<p>--------------------------------- </p>
	<p>Someone asked the following question to a Mullah who issues fatwa (the 
	message was posted by Mr. Mohiuddin): </p>
	<p>&quot;And is it ever reported that Prophet Mohammad, sallallaahu alayhi wa 
	sallam, beat any of his wives? &quot; </p>
	<p>The Mullah reported, by citing Aisha, the Ummul Mumenin that Muhammad had 
	never hit any person with his own hands unless it was for Jihad. </p>
	<p>My response: </p>
	<p>Muhammad had personally beaten Bibi Aisha, his fevorite wife. </p>
	<p>Don't you believe this? </p>
	<p>Here is a Hadis from Sahih Muslim that clearly says that Muhammad punched 
	Aisha: </p>
	<p>When sleeping with Aisha Muhammad surreptitiously left his bed and went 
	to the graveyard at Baqi; Aisha spied and followed Muhammad; when Muhammad 
	learned Aisha’s misdeed he hit her (beat her) on her chest that caused much 
	pain to Aisha…4.2127 </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><b>Book 004, Number 2127:</b> Muhammad b. Qais said 
		(to the people): Should I not narrate to you (a hadith of the Holy 
		Prophet) on my authority and on the authority of my mother? We thought 
		that he meant the mother who had given him birth. He (Muhammad b. Qais) 
		then reported that it was 'A'isha who had narrated this: Should I not 
		narrate to you about myself and about the Messenger of Allah (may peace 
		be upon him)? We said: Yes. She said: When it was my turn for Allah's 
		Messenger (may peace be upon him) to spend the night with me, he turned 
		his side, put on his mantle and took off his shoes and placed them near 
		his feet, and spread the corner of his shawl on his bed and then lay 
		down till he thought that I had gone to sleep. He took hold of his 
		mantle slowly and put on the shoes slowly, and opened the door and went 
		out and then closed it lightly. I covered my head, put on my veil and 
		tightened my waist wrapper, and then went out following his steps till 
		he reached Baqi'. He stood there and he stood for a long time. He then 
		lifted his hands three times, and then returned and I also returned. He 
		hastened his steps and I also hastened my steps. He ran and I too ran. 
		He came (to the house) and I also came (to the house). I, however, 
		preceded him and I entered (the house), and as I lay down in the bed, he 
		(the Holy Prophet) entered the (house), and said: Why is it, O 'A'isha, 
		that you are out of breath? I said: There is nothing. He said: Tell me 
		or the Subtle and the Aware would inform me. I said: Messenger of Allah, 
		may my father and mother be ransom for you, and then I told him (the 
		whole story). He said: Was it the darkness (of your shadow) that I saw 
		in front of me? I said: Yes. He struck me on the chest which caused me 
		pain, and then said: Did you think that Allah and His Apostle would deal 
		unjustly with you? She said: Whatsoever the people conceal, Allah will 
		know it. He said: Gabriel came to me when you saw me. He called me and 
		he concealed it from you. I responded to his call, but I too concealed 
		it from you (for he did not come to you), as you were not fully dressed. 
		I thought that you had gone to sleep, and I did not like to awaken you, 
		fearing that you may be frightened. He (Gabriel) said: Your Lord has 
		commanded you to go to the inhabitants of Baqi' (to those lying in the 
		graves) and beg pardon for them. I said: Messenger of Allah, how should 
		I pray for them (How should I beg forgiveness for them)? He said: Say, 
		Peace be upon the inhabitants of this city (graveyard) from among the 
		Believers and the Muslims, and may Allah have mercy on those who have 
		gone ahead of us, and those who come later on, and we shall, God 
		willing, join you. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>End of Hadis quote. </p>
	<p>Not only that Muhammad, in verse 4:34, asked men to beat their wives, he, 
	at his last days, during last pilgrimage sermon, exhorted men to treat women 
	as domestic animals, deny them food (when necessary, to discipline them) and 
	and to beat them (just like the Bedouin Arab barbarians were used to beating 
	their cattle). </p>
	<p>Very outrageous? You do not believe this? </p>
	<p>Here is the excerpt from Tabari: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">“Now then, O people, you have a right over your wives 
		and they have a right over you. You have [the right] that they should 
		not cause anyone of whom you dislike to tread your beds, and that they 
		should not commit any open indecency (fahishah). If they do, then God 
		permits you to shut them in separate rooms and to beat them, but not 
		severely. If they abstain from [evil], they have the right to their food 
		and clothing in accordance with custom (bi’l-maruf). Treat women well, 
		for they are [like] domestic animals (‘awan) with you and do not possess 
		anything for themselves. You have taken them only as a trust from God, 
		and you have made the enjoyment of their persons lawful by the word of 
		God, so understand and listen to my words, O people. I have conveyed the 
		Message, and have left you with something which, if you hold fast to it, 
		you will never go astray; that is, the Book of God and the sunnah of His 
		Prophet. Listen to my words, O people, for I have conveyed the message 
		and understand [it]. Know for certain that every Muslim is a brother of 
		another Muslim, and that all Muslims are brethren. It is not lawful for 
		a person [to take] from his brother except that which he has given him 
		willingly, so do not wrong </p>

	<p>Want more? </p>
	<p>Here is Umar al Khattab, preaching that a man is not obliged to tell the 
	reason of beating a woman: </p>
	<p>Sunaan Abu Dawud: </p>
	<p>A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife...11.2142 </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><b>Book 11, Number 2142: </b>Narrated Umar ibn al-Khattab: The 
		Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: A man will not be asked as to why he 
		beat his wife. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Beat your wife if she is insolent but do not beat her like a 
	slave-girl...1.0142 </p>
	<p>This Hadis is quite long; I quoted only the relevant part: </p>
	<p>.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>I (the narrator Laqit) then said: Messenger of Allah, I have a wife 
		who has something (wrong) in her tongue, i.e. she is insolent. He said: 
		Then divorce her. I said: Messenger of Allah, she had company with me 
		and I have children from her. He said: Then ask her (to obey you). If 
		there is something good in her, she will do so (obey); and do not beat 
		your wife as you beat your slave-girl. I said: Messenger of Allah, tell 
		me about ablution. He said: Perform ablution in full and make the 
		fingers go through the beard and snuff with water well except when you 
		are fasting. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>End of Hadis quote </p>
	<p>....And I can keep going pages after pages elucidating examples to 
	demonstrate how Islam invokes the beating of women whenever necessary (albait 
	in the name of disciplining her). </p>
	<p>Are the Islamic apologists ashamed of their dearest religion, Islam? Of 
	course, they are. That is why they have to run helter-skelter to turn the 'beaing' 
	verse into a 'kissing' verse. </p>
	<p>Very clever ploy indeed. But this tactic is bound to fail. The world is 
	already aware of the 'golden' treatment women in Islam. </p>
