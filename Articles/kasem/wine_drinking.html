	AND LIQUEUR (including beer, whisky, brandy, Martini, vermouth, gin, vodka, 
	Champagne, Port, Sherry…) are great taboos in Islam. It is a great sin even 
	to hold a bottle of one of these dreadful stuffs, not to talk of dropping a 
	single drop of these <i>haram</i> liquids into one’s ( I mean, a Muslim’s) 
	throat. Ask any Muslim and he will surely attest to what I have diligently 
	written just now. There are severe prescribed (read Islamic) punishments for 
	the production, distribution, sale, trading and consumption of these 
	egregious products. Would you care to know that this is truly a sheer 
	hypocrisy in Islam? When one carefully reads the Qur’an one cannot but be 
	utterly shocked at the unbridled flow of supreme wine and dazzling 
	sex-damsels reserved for the best of the adherents of the faith, while 
	totally forbidding this ‘heavenly’ liquids in this world. Believe it or not 
	in Islamic Paradise it is only non-stop fountain of wine and unlimited 
	supply of women (read sex) for the pious believers (male, of course). If 
	these earthly drinks (wine) are so notorious then why Allah has to reserve 
	their exclusive pleasures for the after world? Why one (a Muslim) must die 
	first to enjoy these subsequent supreme delights? –one may legitimately ask.</font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">Most erudite Islamic scholars associate this verse with 
	the non-attendance in a mosque when intoxicated (or after having sex with a 
	woman). It is of course true that there is no use to attend prayers when one 
	is drunk. However, what these learned scholars forget to mention is that the 
	word ‘defogged’ does not necessarily mean a state of drunkenness. This state 
	could arise due to many reasons, such as: a family quarrel, a physical 
	fight, an over dose of sleep, suffering from a severe headache, a mental 
	disorder…..and so on. Therefore, relating this verse only to intoxication is 
	rather too simplistic, to say the least.&nbsp; In fact, in its literal meaning, 
	this verse has nothing to do with wine drinking. It even does not mention 
	the word wine or any intoxicant. Therefore, this verse cannot be used to 
	prohibit the consumption of alcohol.</span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">This is the verse the zealot Islamists often use to 
	justify the legal prohibition on all affairs dealing with alcoholic drinks. 
	Read this verse once again. There is no way this verse makes alcoholic 
	drinks illegal to consume, produce, distribute, sale or trade. Along with 
	other acts like, gambling, divination…etc. this verse merely declares the 
	danger of intoxicants. This is similar to the present-day government warning 
	on the dangers of smoking tobacco products. Despite severe warning notices 
	on every packet of cigarette sold, the habit of smoking continues. No 
	country (except perhaps Bhutan) has ever tried to ban or make smoking 
	illegal and a punishable offence—at least not yet, so far. The same argument 
	can be easily extended for the consumption of wine during Muhammad’s time. 
	You see, Allah (i.e., Muhammad) was quite a smart person not to force an 
	immediate ban on the consumption of wine, because He knew this would bring 
	immediate retaliation from His adherents who were so used to daily drinking 
	of wine. So, Allah merely advised His followers to eschew this bad habit 
	without He taking a clear stand on the outright banning of drinking wine. 
	While His injunction on the eating of pork and pork products was absolutely 
	unmistakeable, He was quite hesitant in taking such a decisive step on wine 
	drinking. If Allah chose He could have easily promulgated an outright ban on 
	wine. But He did not. Allah (i.e., Muhammad) simply took the step akin to 
	the steps taken by many of today’s governments regarding smoking.</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, why there is a 
	total ban on alcoholic drinks in Islam? The answer lies in <i>hadis</i>. You 
	see, all <i>ahadith</i> were compiled long after Muhammad’s death—at least 
	200 years later. In fact, very soon you will learn that many of those devout 
	Islamic Caliphs were habitual drinkers of wine before the dubious (and often 
	questionable) <i>ahadith</i> were used as legal codes to run the lives of 
	Muslims.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is very 
	little doubt that all these so-called Sahih <i>ahadith</i> do proclaim a 
	total ban on wine and any other alcoholic drink. Such <i>haram</i> drinks 
	cannot even be used in a medicine. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As told before, in 
	the holy Qur’an, wine (or any alcoholic drink) is largely treated as 
	harmful, although there might be minor benefits in it. Certainly, the Qur’an 
	did not proclaim a total ban on the consumption of wine, if we understood 
	the meaning of verse 5:90. It simply exhorted the believers to avoid this 
	harmful drink.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This means: if we 
	are to believe the <i>hadis</i>, then Qur’an is wrong or, alternatively, if 
	we take the Qur’an as the infallible words of Allah then all those <i>
	ahadith</i> dealing in alcoholic drinks are absolutely fabricated, if not 
	outright lies. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Did the companions 
	of the apostle of Allah drink wine? What a outrageous question is this!—you 
	may say. Here is the answer—though most Muslims will simply deny the truth.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You see, most of 
	Muhammad’s companions (except, perhaps Umar and Abu Bakr) were habitual 
	drinkers. Don’t you believe this? Here is a <i>hadis</i> from Sahih Bukhari 
	that tells us Hamzah, the ‘Lion of Islam’ was a real drunkard and womanizer 
	of the first order. In fact, while he (Hamzah) was drunk Muhammad was so 
	scared of him that he (Muhammad) dared not approach him. The arrant, violent 
	and unruly behavior of Hamzah, while drunken was one of the prime reasons to 
	motivate Muhammad to proclaim the avoidance of wine. Let us read this <i>
	hadis</i> from Sahih Bukhari</font></p>

	Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle, I had an appointment with a 
	goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa' to go with me to bring Idhkhir 
	(i.e. grass of pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its 
	price on my wedding party. I was collecting for my she-camels equipment of 
	saddles, sacks and ropes while my two she-camels were kneeling down beside 
	the room of an Ansari man. I returned after collecting whatever I collected, 
	to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their flanks cut open and 
	some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of my two 
	she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, &quot;Who has done this?&quot; The 
	people replied, &quot;Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib who is staying with some Ansari 
	drunks in this house.&quot; I went away till I reached the Prophet and Zaid bin 
	Haritha was with him. The Prophet noticed on my face the effect of what I 
	had suffered, so the Prophet asked. &quot;What is wrong with you.&quot; I replied, &quot;O 
	Allah's Apostle! I have never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked my 
	two she-camels, cut off their humps, and ripped open their flanks, and he is 
	sitting there in a house in the company of some drunks.&quot; The Prophet then 
	asked for his covering sheet, put it on, and set out walking followed by me 
	and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He asked 
	permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah's 
	Apostle started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and 
	his eyes were red. Hamza looked at Allah's Apostle and then he raised his 
	eyes, looking at his knees, then he raised up his eyes looking at his 
	umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at his face. Hamza then 
	said, &quot;Aren't you but the slaves of my father?&quot; Allah's Apostle realized 
	that he was drunk, so Allah's Apostle retreated, and we went out with him.

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span style="font-size: 12pt">While elaborating on the wine drinking habits 
	of some of the Caliphs of Islam, Phillip K. Hitti, the eminent historian of 
	the Arabs writes, “Khamr, made of dates was the favourite. Ibn Khaldun 
	argues that such personages as al-Rashid and al-Ma’mun used only nabidh, 
	prepared by soaking grapes, raisins or dates in water and allowing the juice 
	to ferment slightly. Such drink was judged legal under certain conditions by 
	at least one school of Moslem jurisprudence, the Hanafite. Muhammad himself 
	drank it, especially before it was three days old.” (History of the Arabs; 
	Philip K. Hitti, ch. xxvi, p.337)</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span style="font-size: 12pt">In case you thought that P.K. Hitti was an 
	infidel author, so his words cannot be trusted, here is a foot note that he 
	cites to back up his claims.</span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the same book,

	Ummayad Caliphs; such as:</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Clearly, all those 
	Caliphs (the protectors of Islam) knew Muhammad’s Islam exceedingly well, 
	because they ruled immediately after Muhammad’s death. If wine was <i>
	haramzed</i> by Muhammad they would have definitely refrained from consuming 
	such <i>haramized</i> stuff; since none of them was reported to have 
	consumed a single piece of pork and/or any other <i>haram</i> food.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The total ban on 
	the consumption of wine was truly enforced by the Abbasids, whose founder 
	Abu al-Abbas, having the sobriquet <i>al-Saffat</i> (the blood shedder) was 
	an absolutely cruel, deranged, despotic warlord who was bent to proclaim his 
	brand of extreme chastisement (read Islam) through mindless torture and 
	barbarism. It was during the Abbasid period that the first comprehensive 
	compilation of <i>hadis</i> (Bukhari) was completed. This was around 
	830-840—almost 200 years after Muhammad’s death. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question is: 
	who knew Muhammad’s Islam better—the Ummayad’s, who were in charge of Islam 
	soon after his death, or the Abbasid’s whose brand of Islam was instituted 
	after a long elapse of almost 200 years?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<span lang="EN-GB">Conclusion:</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> The Qur’an does 
	not at all proscribe wine drinking. The ban on alcoholic drinks was 
	certainly a later innovation by the Abbasids. They used questionable <i>
	ahadith</i> to institute such a ban. No one condones the harmful effects of 
	excessive drinking; but it is simply too harsh the Islamic penalty (from 80 
	lashes to death for the repeat offenders) for occasional indulgence in a cup 
	or two of red wine. As suggested by many cardiologists, this may even be 
	beneficial for health, While the infidels enjoy wine and beat the Muslims 
	hands down in maintaining good health and hygiene, the Muslims, on the other 
	hand, mostly suffer from ill-health and poor hygiene. They must reflect on 
	this reality and let those Muslims who like to drink in limited quantity do 
	so without fear or prejudice. This is a basic right of a citizen which is 
	often denied in Islamic Paradises. This forced inhibition on drink is 
	totally unfair and tormenting. The Qur’an confirms that they have the right 
	to consume alcohol—if they choose so.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
