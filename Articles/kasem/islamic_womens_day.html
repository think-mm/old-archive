	<p><font face="Verdana">The world just celebrated the 8th of March 2005 as 
	the International Women’s’ day (IWD). The print and the electronic media 
	remembered this day by publishing a plethora of articles, essays, features, 
	new reports…and what not. In a few newspaper reports I also noted some 
	Muslim women demonstrating in Kuwait, Turkey and Bangladesh demanding some 
	basic human rights that are denied to them by their male-dominated Muslim 
	societies. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">I was wondering how come this time around the 
	Islamists did not come up with a pure Islamic version of International 
	Women’s day? After all, you will surely notice that whenever the civilized 
	world invents, discovers or declares some events that benefit the humanity 
	the Islamists must, within a short period of time, devise an Islamic edition 
	of it. This they do to demonstrate openly the absolute superiority of Islam 
	over anything that the corrupt infidel world had thought to be beneficial to 
	the human race irrespective of color, creed, religion or gender. This 
	Islamic tactic is a clever political ploy by the Islamists around the world 
	to mark the clear division between a fanatic Islamic World and the rest of 
	humanity (the crooked Infidel World). Thus, we have Universal Declaration of 
	Islamic Human Rights (1990) in retaliation of the Universal Declaration of 
	Human Rights by UN in 1940. The other good examples are: Red Crescent 
	Society (in Islamic Paradises) in lieu of The International Red Cross, 
	Islamic Psychology, Islamic Chemistry, Islamic Engineering, Islamic 
	Refrigerators, Islamic Cola, Islamic Cell Phones, Islamic Paradise, Islamic 
	Hell, Islamic Toilet, Islamic Tank, Islamic Bomb, Islamic Jets, Islamic 
	Common Market….and so on. You just name an item or idea and you are bound to 
	find a clever Islamic version of it. Such is the craze and zealotry of the 
	Islamists. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">So, what about Islamic Women’s day? Is there going 
	to be such a day exclusively reserved for all the Muslimahs (female Muslims) 
	living in all the Islamic Paradises? I can bet my bottom dollar that within 
	a few years (possibly within the next 5 years or so) the Islamists will 
	declare another day (not the 8th of March—it is infidel’s calendar, so haram)—possibly 
	a date commensurate with the celebration of the killing of infidels by some 
	woman Jihadi suicide bomber (of course, the calendar to be followed will be 
	Arabic—the Allah’s calendar, no doubt) as the Islamic Women’s Day.. </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">What do you think the Muslimahs, living in Islamic 
	Paradises, will celebrate on this day of the Islamic Women’s day? </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Below, I have compiled some of the outstanding 
	features of Islam which are exclusively applicable to all Muslimahs. These 
	‘marvelous’ features of Islam have been collected from the most authentic 
	Islamic sources, viz. the Qur’an, the Hadis, the Sharia and Imam Ghazali, 
	whose book, ‘Ihya Uloom Ed-Din’ is considered next to the Holy Qur’an. This 
	list, of course, is not comprehensive. If you have time to skim through the 
	vast ocean of Islamic of literatures you will surely discover many such 
	incredible ‘golden ’ treatments of Muslimahs in Islamic societies. Please 
	peruse this list and decide whether the entire feminine gender of the world 
	should follow the Islamic world or not. </font></p>

	and the excerpts from al-Hadis, you may click at the links provided in the

	them in full from the book/s listed in the references.] </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Here is the compiled list of the ‘golden’ rights and 
	provisions for all the Muslimahs in the Islamic world </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The right to be treated as diseased and to be 
	treated as sex toys </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The Qur’an Menstruation is a disease; can't have sex 
	during a woman's period; after the period is over have sex in any manner, at 
	any time and at any place; God loves those who are pure and clean...2:222
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Sahih Bukhari Menstruation is a defect in women, for 
	they cannot fast and pray during their periods...3.31.172 </font></p>

	<p><font face="Verdana">The Qur’an Wives are tilths: sow in them in whatever 
	manner you like...2:223 </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The right to enjoy another husband after the third 
	divorce from the previous husband (hilla marriage) </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The Qur’an If the divorce is pronounced three times 
	then it becomes a final divorce and reconciliation is not possible without 
	the former wife going through a hilla marriage; the wife must be married to 
	another man and then he must divorce her, then only the woman is free to 
	marry back her former husband again; these are God’s laws…2:230 </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Sahih Bukhari An irrevocably divorced woman must 
	marry another man (hila marriage) and have sexual intercourse with him 
	before she can re-marry her former husband…8.73.107 The second husband must 
	have sex for the woman to get a divorce to marry her first husband (hilla 
	marriage)...7.63.187 </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The right to engage in Islamic prostitution through 
	Muta marriage </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The Qur’an Give a dowry for deriving a benefit 
	(sexual pleasure) from a woman and you can vary it mutually (muta 
	marriage)…4:24 can have sex with captive (wives of enemy) women even when 
	their husbands are alive (i.e., sexual intercourse with married with captive 
	women is allowed); dower can be varied with mutual agreement…4:24 </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Sahih Bukhari Muhammad granted permission for 
	contract/temporary marriage with women…8.3246, 3247, 3248 </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Sahih Muslim A cloak was sufficient for a contract 
	temporary marriage; Muhammad later asked that the women under contract 
	temporary marriages should be let off (similar to prostitution)…8.3252, 
	8.3253, 3258 </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The right to be treated as impure as a drunkard
	</font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The Qur’an You can't go to a mosque intoxicated or 
	after having touched a woman...4:43 </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The right to be treated as unreliable and 
	untrustworthy </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The Qur’an Do not break your pledge similar to a 
	woman who undoes her thread after she had spun it strong (i.e., women are 
	not reliable, they easily break their pledges)…16:92 </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">To uphold the inalienable superiority of men over 
	women and the right to be beaten by husbands—no questions asked </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The Qur’an Men are protectors and maintainers of 
	women; women must be devoutly obedient, if not then beat them...4:34 </font>
	</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">God asked Job to beat his wife with a green branch; 
	he was a true believer…38:44 </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">Sunaan Abu Dawud A man will not be asked as to why 
	he beat his wife...11.2142 A woman who complains about the beatings she 
	receives from her husband is not the best woman...11.2141 </font></p>

	Sharia, in his book, ‘Women in Society’writes: </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">A refractory wife has no legal right to object to

	<p><font face="Verdana">Abdur Rahman I Doi, the recognized authority on

	permission unless there is a necessity or legitimate reason for her to do 
	otherwise. However, it is his religious obligation to be compassionate and 
	not to unreasonably restrict her freedom of movement. If there arises a 
	conflict between this right of the husband and the rights of the wife's 
	parents to visit her and be visited by her, the husband's right prevails in 
	the wider interest of the family. Yet the Shari'ah recommends that he be 
	considerate enough to waive his rights to avoid shame within the family.

	exact the service of her husband who is a freeman, as this would amount to a 
	reversal of their appointed stations, for one of the requisites of marriage 
	is, that the woman be as a servant, and the man as the person served; but if 
	the service of the husband to the wife were to constitute her dower, it 
	would follow that the husband is the servant and the wife as the served: and 
	this being a violation of the requisites of marriage, is therefore illegal; 
	but it is otherwise with the service stipulated to be performed by another 
	free person, with that person’s consent, as this offers no violence to the 
	requisites of the contract; and so also in the case of service of a slave, 
	because the service performed by a slave to his wife is, in fact, performed 
	to his master, by whose consent it is that he undertakes it; and the same 
	with the case of tending flocks, because this is a service of a permanent 
	nature, and admitted to be performed for wives, and therefore, does not 
	violate the requisites of marriage; for the service of the husband to his 
	wife, as a dower, is prohibited only as it may be degrading to the former;

	<p><font face="Verdana">Conclusion: If you are appalled by patiently reading 
	what I diligently cited from the most authentic Islamic sources please bear 
	in mind that those uncivilised Islamic provisions are not mere rhetoric or 
	dead passages buried in the incredibly unfathomed depth of Islamic epics. 
	Those Islamic requirements are living laws enacted in many Islamic 
	Paradises, such as Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, certain 
	parts of Nigeria and Malaysia. They are compulsory for all the Muslim women 
	as well as for the infidel women living (in some Islamic countries like 
	Saudi Arabia) there. It is also feared that those barbaric Islamic customs 
	may soon be imposed upon the Iraqi women. Isn’t March 8th the most 
	appropriate time for all women in the world to raise their call to free 
	their Muslim sisters from such unimaginable, barbaric, middle-age tyranny? 
	There is no dignity, no respect and no basic human rights for women in the 
	Muslim world. They are living in a world completely devoid of reason, 
	justice, equality of gender and human dignity. Shall we not do something for 
	these wretched, hapless women? Are we not living in a civilised society?
