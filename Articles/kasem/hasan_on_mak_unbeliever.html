	Mr Abul Kasem<br>
	<br>
	Now now, what do we have here indeed. Lets see… hmm it’s a posting… a 
	posting in which you thought would inspire many of us misguided 
	&quot;fundamentalist&quot; to become non believers in a god. A mail in which you 
	thought would show the rest of us that we have a right to be embarrased of 
	our heritage and religon… hmm... Why don’t we have a look at what you said….<br>
	<br>
	You start your mail by talking about the Biswa Ijtemain <ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">Bangladesh</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> 
</ST1:PLACE>. Yet you ignore the fact that these countries are corrupt mainly by 
	the secular leaders. Crime at the majority of the time is commited by 
	disbelivers in an afterlife or people who have no morals or those who do not 
	think that they will be judged. You therefore have shown that in these least 
	developed muslim countries it’s the bad people who are on top not the good.<br>
	<br>
	You then claim Arabic is the language of Allah. As far as im aware Allah 
	knows all languages and every thing that is in existence. Arabic for your 
	information is not the languague of Allah it was the language of the arabs.<br>
	<br>
	And of course infidels are going to have it better its because this is there 
	paradise. However your forgetting the blessing of the entire muslim world 
	Allah has bestowed on them, in the example of providing them with oil, gas 
	plentiful of natural resources which many countries lack. Had the muslim 
	ummah followed the religon properly, poverty would not exist in the muslim 
	world, had they followed the law of God properly we woud be under the 
	khillafa and it would be the most powerful force on earth. This is what 
<ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">America</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> 
</ST1:PLACE>and the rest of the non believers or so called anti islamic named 
	muslims fear.<br>
	<br>
	They fear that the islamic state concept will distrupt 
<ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">Americas</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> 
</ST1:PLACE>and the west influence on the world and are therefore using the 
	likes of you and everything else to thrawth it. Obviously people fighting 
	for the islamic revolution to come back understand this, and are…... But 
	hold on I shall stop this sentence here as I know this may cause you and 
	others on this board many sleepless nights, so I will Shsssssssh here and 
	not disrupt your sleep!.<br>
	<br>
	You then go on to talk about floods. Hmm but when a country is corrupt such 
	as <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION 
w:st="on">bangladesh</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> </ST1:PLACE>is not surprising for 
	floods to take people away. If the country was an proper established islamic 
	nation, we would not have the corruption problems we face today and would be 
	able to deal with these natural disaster matters. But then again I doubt you 
	would ever understand this, as your knowledge on islam from what I read in 
	your mail is quite poor. But then again the problem is you may not 
	understand how if a person drowns he is considered as shaheed. Obviously 
	because you cling onto this life so much your concept of dieing is a scary 
	one!.<br>
	<br>
	You may think that individual who has drowned is at a loss yet in Islam 
	he/she has gained a wonderful life. For example he/she may not have the 
	chance of being misguided by those corrupt mullahs or by the likes of you 
	and other secularist. He/she has escaped the problems of life and is at a 
	better place. Maybe this is something you will never get but hey I cant 
	blame you. You seemed persecuted and a non believer in a god. Yet the way 
	the world has been created may have never entered your head and just like in 
	the belief of God may seem ridicolous by you, so does the scientific 
	theories on the creation of mandkind and the universe.<br>
	<br>
	You talk about <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION 
w:st="on">Iran</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> </ST1:PLACE>the shia nation. If the two 
	cases are true then surely it’s the so called &quot;mullahs&quot; who did this 
	injustice will also face simillar punishment in the afterlife. Oh but then 
	you may not believe in that, you may think you will come back recarnated 
	into an rat. So I better not scare you any further….as london has a huge rat 
	population, they say theres 2 rats per person in the country, I shall be 
	kind to not step on them when travelling on the underground.<br>
	<br>
	You then go on to talk about killing children is in Islam. Please PROOVE 
	your lie. Children and women are protected in JIHAD. What happened in BESLAN 
	was terrorism. In fact the true story of that disaster would never be known. 
	The fact that you think such is possible by Islam shows how closed your mind 
	is and how immature your mentality is. I think you been brainwashed.<br>
	<br>
	Quite interesting on your claims of tablique jamat. Although I do not follow 
	tablique beliefs, I do have to say you have again fabricated a lie where you 
	talk about them sanctioning the Dar ul Harb concept. I know for a fact they 
	don’t. Maybe the people you know were messed up. Maybe you attract those 
	type of people because of your own nature. Maybe you seek these types of 
	people because you yourself have never seeked the truth and have placed 
	yourself amongst these people.<br>
	<br>
	Maybe you have the problem? Ever thought of that? I mean quite tragic that 
	you have been persecuted in believing these thai girls were allowed for 
	pleasure. I am trynig to think, on this trip was were you gay at any point? 
	Cause boy if I didn’t believe in a god id go for a thai massage as well!! I 
	hear they are quite umm interesting…. Bit strange how you kept away from 
	that stuff… Boy you must have been gay or have some will power!... You see I 
	don’t understand how you can consider a person is practising Islam if they 
	have sex in brothels.<br>
	Quite confusing mind you have there.<br>
	<br>
	You then go on about being ashamed of telling someone you cant drink. Maybe 
	your next thing is that you should be ashamed of being a bengali because 
	your regarded as the &quot;miskeen&quot; by the rest of the world. Maybe your future 
	generation will be white skinned helped by you marrying a white girl so you 
	don’t have to have your brown skin interferring with your embarrasement of 
	what you were born. Maybe you have a problem with your whole origin and hate 
	being who you are. Maybe you just cant handle what you are and feel inferior 
	to the super white race. And maybe your ashamed as you have no guts to stick 
	up for a belief that you may have had. Hmm sounds a bit like the Hitler 
	propaganda here.<br>
	<br>
	You then talk about terrorism in <ST1:PLACE 
w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION w:st="on">iraq</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> </ST1:PLACE>, 
	and how these terrorist are killing people. Because you havent got a white 
	skin and you have a muslim name you then talk about how you try to hide your 
	face from your neighbours because you don’t like the way you was born. 
	Because of your cowardness to stand up against these terrorist in the name 
	of Islam, you rather hide away and say im not a muslim because I am being 
	judged for the action of others. But maybe if that’s the case then it’s a 
	problem with the others and not yourself. Maybe they should be aware that 
	muslims do not believe in this and that those acts are as barbaric as the 
	pilot dropping a bomb on a mosque or a school where many children and women 
	are blown apart! Maybe when your in that situation and your mum, your dad 
	your siblings and even children are taken away you can sit there and say, O 
	America, How I love you america!...<br>
	<br>
	You then again fabricate lies, by saying how a muslim son has to disown his 
	parents. Ermm right, so all the reverts to Islam in the world disown their 
	parents do they? Quite interesting lie you have said, considering that the 
	non muslim parents still have rights on a muslim son. The muslim son still 
	has to RESPECT his parents and as long as they don’t force him to do haraam, 
	such as forcing him to drink. Regardless of how they are the muslim son 
	still has to be kind to them .You then talk about the Hujur beating the 
	student. Yes well obviously in developing countries this will occur. 
	Solution is education that this practice should be abolished. But hold on!!! 
	The country is corrupt!!! How do we get the message across!.<br>
	<br>
	The people who are on the top and who don’t believe in Islam are too busy 
	filling their own pockets! They don’t have time for the country do they? 
	They don’t have time to educate the masses to they, nah instead they have 
	time to sing amar sonar bangla! That’s ok! As long as that happens we 
	bangladeshis are alright, wouldn’t be surprised if the next statement is Jai 
	Hind.<br>
	<br>
	You then talk about the arabic name. Well bengali names have moved a bit 
	from arabic name as we don’t have their system practiced in bangladesh im 
	sure your not the &quot;bin&quot; or &quot;ibn&quot; of your fathers name. In fact we are 
	following the western surname concept so this prooves you wrong again.<br>
	<br>
	You seem upset of the toilet habits as well and the hygiene, of course your 
	western friends who don’t wash their hands in the toilet or wipe the A$$ are 
	much cleaner than us. But of course they just contract sexual diseases, 
	typhoid and other stuff much less don’t they?. But maybe you don’t like the 
	cleaniness of the religion. Maybe you like to be dirty or your into smelling 
	your own production because the western clean white skin makes up for all 
	the dirt. Maybe its psychological problem with your skin colour, you feel 
	being brown means being dirty so being white and dirty seems better?<br>
	<br>
	You talk about the workers sent there to work in the streets of arabia. Talk 
	to the companies who send them there exploiting many of these workers. Talk 
	to the bengali uncles living it large in <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:COUNTRY-REGION 
w:st="on">bangladesh</ST1:COUNTRY-REGION> </ST1:PLACE>on these poor souls 
	working in these corrupt regimes. Blame our dynastical families for being so 
	corrupt and not putting their foot down on their abuses. Just like every 
	bengali, money rules, these arabs pay them off and they shutup. Ever thought 
	why the pakistnis are now being treated better in the arab states?.<br>
	<br>
	You again talk about your inferiority complex of being brown the tragic 
	brown colour, or shall I say the stuff that comes out of your backside. You 
	talk abot people considering arabs superior to you, even though Islam says 
	everyone is equal. Because of your own messed up mind and inferiority 
	complex you then question your faith due to your own misunderstanding of 
	race and due to your love of the white colour.<br>
	<br>
	I would say a person with this type of life seems quite tragic. I think you 
	yourself have been trully tramatised. I can see that you have lied quite a 
	bit on the religon. Tut.. Tut.. naughty naughty. I think you need help from 
	a shrink. It seems you have not just a problem of your religion you was so 
	wickedly born into (blame your parents, id say) but also your skin colour.<br>
	<br>
	Hey michael <ST1:PLACE w:st="on"><ST1:CITY 
w:st="on">Jackson</ST1:CITY> </ST1:PLACE>did the full shabang, why don’t you 
	just become a rich doctor and do the same!<br>
	<br>
	Maybe then you can rid yourself of your bengaliness and I wouldn’t have had 
	to waste my precious time responding to your joke<br>
	<br>
	Of course there is another solution. You may try taking some pills, and go 
	to the other side. I am sure then your questions and doubts will all go 
	away…<br>
	<br>
	Thanks to the advent of the Internet, people are also able to respond<br>
