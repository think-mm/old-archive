  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A few Neo-Razakars and some Pakistanis 
  are in the devious game again. They are trying to sow the seed of doubt in the 
  minds of new generation of Bangalees about the severity of 1971 Genocide. One 
  of these Neo-Razakars even had the audacity to say that only about few hundred 
  thousand (150 000 - 250 000) people were killed in Bangladesh. We know why 
  these people are suddenly active again when the Bangladesh election is just a 
  month away. One Pakistani even said that it is nearly impossible for the 90 
  000 Pakistani soldiers to kill 3 million Bangladeshis in just 9 months time. 
  Let us do some calculations to refute their well design plan. Let us take our 
  calculator and do some calculations based on international data. We shall do 
  this calculation and compare that with those of Cambodia, another land of 
  genocide.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Bangladesh </b></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1981, UN's declaration of Universal 
  Human Rights writes; &quot;Among the genocides of human history, the highest number 
  of people killed in lower span of time is in Bangladesh in 1971. An average of 
  6000 (six thousand) to 12 000 (twelve thousand) people were killed every 
  single day..........This is the highest daily average in the history of 
  genocide's.&quot; The occupation army of Pakistan committed this holy act for an 
  approximate period of 260 days (from the night of 25 March,1971 to their 
  surrender on the 16th. December, 1971). Using UN's figures multiply them with 
  260 days. What figures do we get? Please take a calculator and check this one out.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(1) Lower limit of Bangalee killed = 6 
  000 x 260 = 1 560 000 (1.56 million) Higher limit of Bangalee killed = 12 000 
  x 260 = 3 120 000 (3.12 million) We can take an average value of 2 340 000 
  (2.34 million)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(2) In 1971 there were around 75 
  million people in Bangladesh. The average size of a Bangalee family was around 
  5 (five) at that time. Divide 75 million by 5 which gives 15 million families 
  in Bangladesh in 1971. Number killed per family = 0.16 (2.34 million divided 
  by 15 million) Number of families affected with at least one family member 
  killed = 6.4 (15 million divided by 2.34 million).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is 42.7% (6.4 multiplied by 100 
  and divided by 15) of families. For simplicity, let us use a round figure of 
  40%. This means that 40% of Bangalee families were affected with the loss of 
  at least one family member. Of course, there were thousands of families where 
  the loss of family members was more than one. In many cases, the entire family 
  excepting a lone survivor was wiped out. If these facts are taken in to 
  consideration then the average percentage affected (40%) will change.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(3) Numbers killed by each Pakistani 
  soldier = 26 persons (2.34 million divided by 90 000 soldiers) in 260 days. I 
  have excluded the Razakars who joined the Pakistani soldiers later. An 
  approximate number of Razakars will be around 50,000 to 60,000 or may be 
  more. No one knows the real data). Do your own calculations if you want to 
  include the Razakars. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(4) Numbers killed by each Pakistani 
  soldier per day is 0.1 person. (26 divided by 260).</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That is, one Pakistani soldier killed 
  at least one Bangalee in every ten days. Is that an impossible job? Are these 
  numbers unbelievable? The 3 million people killed by the Pakistani soldiers is 
  not at all impossible. The above calculations clearly demonstrate this fact. 
  That was exactly what happened in Bangladesh. In fact, the September 1972 
  issue of National Geographic clearly writes that more than 3 million people 
  were killed in Bangladesh. This fact was revealed almost after a year of the 
  carnage. Therefore, the records are surely more authentic and free from bias.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Cambodia </b></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us now look in to another 
  genocide, which has no match in human history. This is the genocide by Khmer 
  Rouge in Cambodia. Official figure of genocide toll is 1.7 million (many 
  sources quote a figure of around 2 million. But let us work with the 1.7 
  million figure). This was not done in 260 days (like Pakistani soldiers) but within 
  a period of Khmer Rouge rule of 4 (four) years (from 1975 to 1979). Cambodia's 
  population in 1970 was 6.94 million and its population in 1988 was 7.87 
  million. The average population growth in Cambodia can be taken as 2.3% 
  (Source: Book of Vital World statistics; by The Economist Books (page 16). 
  Published by Hutchinson Business books Ltd. London, 1990). Using this 
  population growth rate we can calculate the following. The population of 
  Cambodia in 1974 (genocide year) would have been around 7.6 million (1.023 
  raised to the power of 4 then multiplied by 6.94 million). Number of 
  Cambodians killed = 1.74 million. Therefore, % of population killed = 22.8% 
  (in Cambodia) % of population killed in Bangladesh = 4% (using the 3 million 
  figure) I do not have the data for the average family size in Cambodia. So, 
  using the same assumption as in Bangladesh (5 members per family). Numbers of 
  families in Cambodia in 1974 = 1.52 million Numbers of people killed per 
  family in Cambodia in 1974 = 1.14 Number of people killed per day (for 4 
  years) = 1192</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, let us assume that the Khmer 
  rouge squeezed the time of killing to 260 days instead of 4 years. Then the number 
  of people killed per day (in 260 days) would have been around 7000 (seven 
  thousand per day). This figure is not very far off from the daily killings in 
  Bangladesh.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We can conclude the following </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The figure 3 million is not a pie in 
  the sky figure. It is quite an accurate estimate of the people killed in 
  Bangladesh in 1971. 90,000 Pakistani soldiers can and did kill the 3 million Bangalees in approximately 9 months time. It was not an impossible task as 
  suggested by some Pakistani. In terms of severity and the density of people 
  killed per family, the Cambodian genocide is far worse than Bangladesh 
  genocide. (1.14 per family in Cambodia vs.0.16 per family in Bangladesh). In 
  reality, the density of killing in Cambodia was about 7 times more ferocious 
  than in Bangladesh. Approximately 40% families in Bangladesh lost at least one 
  family member. Every family in Cambodia lost more than one family member. In 
  terms of speed of killing, Bangladesh genocide is the worst in history. An 
  average of 9000 (mean of 6 000 and 12 000 of the U.N figure) people killed per 
  day for 260 days versus approximately 1200 people killed per day (for 4 years) 
  in Cambodia. The big difference between the Bangladesh genocide and the 
  Cambodian genocide was this. Cambodia set up a People's Revolutionary Tribunal 
  in August 1979 to try Pol Pot and Ieng Sary. They were tried in absentia (at 
  least). This was the first genocide trial based on UN policy. No such trial 
  ever took place in Bangladesh. Do our politicians have the guts to do what the 
  humble Cambodians did for justice? To my mind, the answer is simply 'no'. All 
  our politicians are impotent. They are still hooked on 'Islamic brotherhood.&#65533; 
  The people must revolt and establish their own tribunal to bring justice. This 
  tribunal should also try our impotent, gutless politicians for failing to 
  deliver justice when they were in power. Is this possible in Bangladesh?</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Some afterthoughts </b></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The gratuitous and wanton killing of 
  astronomical number of unarmed Bangalees by marauding soldiers of Pakistan 
  should not go unpunished. We ask the International Tribune on Human Rights to 
  look into this crime against humanity seriously and do the needful. Some of 
  the officers are still in theirs sixties and seventies. Time is running out. 
  Some of these killers are respectable citizens of Pakistan who are collecting 
  their pension sitting in the comfort of their home. These killers should be 
  apprehended and bring to International Court of Justice in The Hague, The 
  Netherlands. If Awami League comes out victorious in this election of October 
  1, then there is a fair chance that a move could be made by the government of 
  Bangladesh to bring the Bangladesh Genocide into the fore. However, if BNP and 
  its Islamic allies win the race, then one can say good-bye to such move. BNP&#65533;s 
  leader Mrs. Khaleda Zia still has high regards for Pakistan. All in all, the 
  next election is very crucial for Bangladesh. The love for Pakistan is one 
  issue that can differentiate Awami League from BNP and her allies. Please do 
  your needful to spread the word that we demand a justice that had eluded the 
  Bangalees for the last thirty years.</font></p>

  THE NUMBER-GAME OF 3 MILLION. </span></font></b></p>

  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The number-game has popped up again in 
  NFB about our martyrs of 1971. While there are killer Maolanas and corrupt 
  politicians (almost al of ours) to play with this, I prefer not to take any 
  NFB-writer as any of them. While trust on our writers is important, distortion 
  or simply presentation of information has profound impact on the result. Far 
  from being a musician I am trying to clarify this with basic music-math, to 
  address an accredited musician-writer in his language of mind (mine too!).
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One change of NISHAD from KOMOL to 
  SHUDDHO changes Malkosh to Chondrokosh, an altogether different Raag with 
  complete different taste. One change of KOMOL GANDHAR to SHUDDHO GANDHAR 
  changes Bagesree to Ragesree, again a very different Raag with different 
  taste. Small changes in Raag Mollar create Meghmollar, Surmollar, Notmollar, 
  Mia-Ki-Mollar, Ramdashi-Mollar (there are others, dont remember now) etc, all 
  with very different impressions and impacts. Inclusion of NISHAD to Raag Abhog 
  transforms it to Bagesree, exclusion of KORhI-MA (MA as a whole) could not 
  stop Bhupali from being included in the KOLLYAN-THAAT. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Without any note-change, if the SA of 
  Bhupali is shifted to its own PA, then the Sargam changes from SA RE GA PA DHA 
  SA to SA RE MA PA DHA SA, which is nothing but Raag Durga, again with a very 
  different impact. EVEN WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF NOTES (information), ONLY 
  DIFFERENT MOVEMENT (presentation) OF THE TUNE CHANGES RAAG DARBARI TO 
  JOUNOPURI, AND RAAG BHUPALI TO DESHKAAR. Please correct if this non-musician 
  is wrong. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The spirit of 1971 has been victimized 
  form all the angles of the examples given above, by our own people. So the 
  spirit did the very right thing, it just evaporated. The recent number-game of 
  3-million resulted in confusion in peoples mind. We do have figures from 
  World Bank, foreign Universities, Newspapers and other establishments like 
  National Geographic, even from the UN-Human Rights Department, ranging from 
  0.25 to 3 million, thanks to Mukto-Mona, (NOT so called Murkho-Mona, Sir! 
  Let us break the nasty prison of name-calling and get out of it, all of us.) 
  That is a huge span, never academically addressed. These figures, though from 
  accredited institutions, do not enjoy the support of any documented research 
  in our vast villages. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Without any backing of formal research 
  and survey, 3-million always remained vulnerable though it went unchallenged 
  for many years and got its wide acceptability. Nobody, except a character of 
  Humayun Ahmeds TV-Drama, took the initiative of such an important follow up 
  of number-count of our genocide. Now as the wind has changed its direction, 
  there are innocent academic / ill-motivated efforts to verify / challenge it. 
  We must realize that it is only natural, unless our Govt. gives the job to an 
  International Institution (Uuuups! His Excellency The Mottya-Razakar &amp; Co. is 
  right there sitting in our Parliament!). Now we can only speculate, debate 
  endlessly, and get more confused about the seriousness of the genocide. 
  Keeping in mind that the criminals of 1971 and their supporters want that, the 
  only healthy way left for us now is to take 3 Million as not an absolute but 
  as an arbitrary number, because we need a number to address the issue of 
  genocide. ALL NUMBERS ARE NOT ABSOLUTE, WE DO USE ARBITRARY NUMBERS 
  EXTENSIVELY ALL THE TIME IN OUR LIVES. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the Quraan when God changes his 
  oneness to plurality, uses WE or US for Himself, the expression is only 
  SHOMMANARTH-E BOHUBOCHON, He is still one. When the young Prince criss-crosses 
  Seven Seas and Thirteen Rivers in search of the life-bird of the demon, he 
  only travels from horizon to horizon. When we pardon SHAAT KHOON of our dear 
  ones, we never mean seven killings. PONCHO BYANJON may not be exactly five 
  dishes; PONCHOBOTI may have fifty Bot-trees. SHOPTODINGA is only one 
  huge boat. DOSH NEKI or SOTTOR SAWAB is far from real numbers. SHOPTO 
  ASMAN does not exist at all. There are not seven but twelve different notes 
  in each SHOPTOK of a harmonium or keyboard, CHALSHE also may happen before 
  or after 40 years of age. You could buy ASHEE mangoes in fifties in the 
  mango market, which was really a hundred, and during the NEEL-time of 
  British Bengal the ignorant peasants actually had to pay 25 bundles of their 
  produce to meet the KURhI of the system. 3 million today is like the 
  existence of god. If one does not believe in it, there are proofs. If one 
  believes in it, there are stronger proofs. While it is so, in the absence of 
  a Judge why must we be lost in this endless debate where none but only the 
  killers win? </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I repeat, we need a number to address 
  the issue of 71s genocide. We may get an all-acceptable number if and when 
  the criminals will be dragged to the court and a formal investigation will be 
  done. Until then our best option is to regard 3 million as not an absolute 
  but an arbitrary number. </font></p>
