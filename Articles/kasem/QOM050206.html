	<p>MR RAIHAN is an occasional writer at VM and MM. Recently; he has been 
	posting regular, religion-based messages in these websites. Many of his 
	essays are quite thoughtful and deserve to be attended to. Of late, he has 
	confused the readers by his enigmatic stand, vis-à-vis Islam. I am quite 
	confused on his position with Islam, that is: whether he is a Quran-Only 
	Muslim, a newly converted Islamist, a critique of Ali Sina or a Bible 
	Basher. I read with interest his message to SKM which was written in 
	English. Although, Mr Raihan’s post was specifically addressed to SKM, I am 
	taking the liberty of expressing my candid opinion/s on four issues which he 
	had asked SKM to respond to. MM and VM are public forums for discussions on 
	controversial issues, and every member has the freedom to express his/her 
	opinion on any matter that is pertinent. </p>
	<p>This is what Mr. Raihan to SKM: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>[Mr. SKM,<br>
		</p>
		<p>Thanks for your feed back article. However, you have utterly failed 
		to comprehend my points. It is maybe mainly because of your hurried 
		answer! Yes, you did. <br>
		</p>
		<p>At the end of my article I have clearly written &quot;I would be grateful 
		if anyone point out my mistakes&quot;. Still you have accused me as a 'liar'. 
		You didn't differentiate between 'mistake' and 'lie'. I hate it. You 
		will not offer me some bucks for lying, right?<br>
		</p>
		<p>Anyway, I will try to write a rebuttle of your reply after having the 
		following answers from you. Please cite the exact verses on the 
		following points:<br>
		</p>
		<p>1. Temporal <b>Death Penalty</b> for the apostates.<br>
		2. <b>Stonning to Death</b> for the adulterer.<br>
		3. <b>FIVE-times prayer </b>and it's rules and regulations, the way 
		people do.<br>
		4. <b>Fasting from late-night-to-evening</b> without eating.<br>
		</p>
		<p>I could write more points but this is enough for me. Before citing a 
		verse please read it first. I am absolutely ready to accept the truth, 
		also said the same in my article.<br>
		</p>
		<p>Thanks<br>
		-Raihan]<br>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><span lang="EN-AU">Item 2: Stoning 
	to death for adulterers</span></b></p>
	<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">Of course, for adultery, there is no clear 
	cut, stand-alone verse of stoning in the Qur’an. This provision, which is 
	frequently carried out in some Islamic Paradises, is instituted as Hudud 
	(fixed) law, which no force on earth could change. The question is: why do 
	all the Islamic scholars (except for the microscopic Qur’an-Only-Muslims or 
	the submitters, Rashad Khalifa being their Prophet) are unanimous on stoning 
	for adultery? The straight answer is that: there are a few ahadith which 
	clearly prove that Muhammad had personally enforced stoning on a few 
	occasions which involved the cases of adultery. The evidence is also there 
	in the Sirah. In fact, there is a hadis in Ibn Majah (hadis number 1944) in 
	which Aisha claimed that a goat came to Muhammad’s house during his death 
	and it swallowed the paper (or leave) on which this stoning verse was 
	written. </font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">There are many Qur’anic verses which do 
	mention of stoning for various offences/activities.</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">Here are some examples:</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">The city of Lot (Sodom) was destroyed with 
	brimstones of baked clay (i.e. God destroyed Sodom with stoning) in 
	layers...11:82</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">The disbelievers threatened Shuib with 
	stoning but for his brothers and friends (family); they accused of being a 
	weak person and rejected him outright…11:91</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">Abraham’s father threatened Abraham with 
	stoning for forsaking idolatry, asked him to leave the parental home…19:46</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">The disbelievers threatened the three 
	messengers with stoning…36:18&nbsp;</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">One might legitimately say that those 
	stoning were from historical events. But wait. Does not Qur’an confirm that 
	what was done during those Prophets’ time is still valid? In fact, Allah, in 
	Qur’an, says that he had sent Muhammad to restore those old traditions and 
	practices—that is, the traditions of Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus…etc. Qur’an 
	even asserts that they preached what Muhammad was fighting 
	for—re-introducing Islam and Sharia, Those Prophets were, in essence, the 
	early Muslims or Islamists, before Muhammad. During the days of those 
	monotheistic Prophets, one of the methods of execution was by stoning and 
	the Qur’an does confirm this provision, and evidently, the offence of 
	adultery is included in Allah’s punishment.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">Please note that Allah’s (verse 11:82) 
	preferred method of destruction is by stoning. He loves to stone unbelievers 
	and transgressors (adultery included) to death! So, what more could one say? 
	If Allah is in favour of stoning why should Muhammad be different?<br>
	&nbsp;</font></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><b><span lang="EN-AU">Item 3: Five 
	prayers:</span></b></p>
	<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">Raihan’s rather blithe argument can be

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">Show us a verse in the Qur’an which 
	prohibits the Muslims to pray five prayers a day in the manner they do.</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">Any erudite and cognizant reader will attest 
	that this type of arguments and counter arguments are just dim-witted and 
	serve no purpose. Any dispute on Qur’an which asks one to prove that which 
	is not mentioned in the Qur’an is simply childish, to say the least. The 
	only outcome of such a mess is entering into an endless loop. So, let us 
	avoid this trap.</font></span></p>

	<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">This issue can also be addressed by saying 
	that nowhere does the Qur’an say a Muslim cannot fast the way he currently 
	does, simply because nothing is precisely detailed in the Qur’an. If fact, 
	one might correctly point out that the fasting here refers to refraining 
	from talking to people during the waking hours, as nothing is mentioned 
	about the partaking of food, since this was the method of fasting by the 
	Jews. But, I think Muhammad did not mean the fasting as was practiced by the 
	Jews. He, in reality, copied the ritual of fasting as was practiced by the 
	Sabians (a religious sect living in the northern Iraq). Historical evidences 
	suggest that they were used to 30-day fasting, not consuming any food from 
	dawn to dusk. Interested readers might like to consult my essay, Who 
	Authored the Qur’an which can be read at VM, MM or FFI website.</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">Here is a verse from the Qur’an which does 
	mention about not to eat during the fasting period (from dawn to dusk):</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">2:187. It is made lawful for you to have 
	sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts). They 
	are Lîbas [i.e. body cover, or screen, or Sakan, (i.e. you enjoy the 
	pleasure of living with her - as in Verse 7:189) Tafsir At-Tabarî], for you 
	and you are the same for them. Allâh knows that you used to deceive 
	yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. 
	So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allâh has 
	ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread 
	(light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of 
	night), then complete your Saum (fast) till the nightfall. And do not have 
	sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I'tikâf (i.e. 
	confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the 
	worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allâh, so 
	approach them not. Thus does Allâh make clear His Ayât (proofs, evidences, 
	lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, Allâh's 
	set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqûn (the 
	pious - see V.2:2).</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">So, the bottom line is: while the Qur’an 
	does not set forth minute details on many of the rituals practiced by the 
	current Muslims world-wide, this does not mean that what they are engaged in 
	are against the Qur’an.</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">That is why the entire Islamic community is 
	dependent on Hadis, Sunnah and other sources of Islamic practices.</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">
	<font style="FONT-SIZE: 10.5pt">The reality is: if we thought Hadis is 
	despicable, vicious and loathsome and the Qur’an is pristine, we might be 
	shocked that the Qur’an could be more damaging to Islam than Hadis and 
	Sunnah are. Qur’an will not save Islam’s shame. Time is on our side. We will 
	render Qur’an as useless as Hadis and throw it in the dustbin of history. We 
	have done this for Hadis, we will do the same to the Qur’an.</font></span></p>
