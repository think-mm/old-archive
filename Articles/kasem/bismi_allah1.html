	This essay painstakingly analyses Allah, the Islamic God. Allah is at the 
	core of religion of Islam. Every act, every ritual, every <i>Jihad</i>, 
	every Islamic incursion, every Islamic bloodshed, every Islamic law is 
	designed for only one purpose—to please Allah. Who this Allah is? Where did 
	He come from? Where does He live now? What are His daily activities? How is 
	His temperament? What are His likes and dislikes? Does Allah have an 
	Executive Office?—how does that office look like? Does Allah have a Throne? 
	Does Allah have a physical body or is Allah just amorphous—without any 
	corporeal existence –but only an invisible, incomprehensible, a 
	never–to–be–understood entity? These are extremely blasphemous questions. 
	None the less, these questions haunt every Muslim’s mind from the moment he 
	hears Allah’s name to the moment of his last breath. But he never gets any 
	satisfactory answers to these perennial questions. For eternity, Allah would 
	like to remain an enigma to the Muslims. Islamists always advance this 
	mysterious, elusive nature of Allah as the epitome of Islam—Allah has to 
	remain obscure, recondite and ephemeral—this is what makes Islam great—the 
	hide–and–seek game of Allah with His devotees. This essay is an attempt to 
	remove this antediluvian, outdated and irrational method to understand 
	Allah. The most surprising result of this enquiry about Allah is that: Allah 
	is not at all a mystery. He is just like any one of us—a living and 
	breathing human being, so to speak! Allah is not esoteric; neither is He 
	hiding from us. He lived, yes, with Muhammad, but did not die with Muhammad. 
	Based on irrefutable evidences, this essay will tell the story of Allah and 
	how Muhammad advanced Allah as a deity to be worshipped—just because he 
	wanted to be worshipped—in the name of Allah, in the manner the pagans 
	worshipped Allah. </font></font></p>

	</font><font face="Verdana"><b><span style="text-transform: uppercase">
	<font size="2">Introduction</font></span><font size="2"><br>
	</font></b><font size="2">The very first two words in every <i>sura</i> 
	(chapter) in the Holy Qur’an, are <b><i>Bismi Allah</i></b> (sometimes 
	written as <i>Bismillah or Basmallah)</i> which, translated into English 
	mean: <i>In the name of Allah</i>. The only exception is s<i>ura 9</i> (<i>Sura 
	Baraat</i> or <i>Sura at-Taubat</i>). The reason why these two words (I 
	mean, <i>Bismi Allah) </i>are missing from <i>sura 9</i> is that it is a 
	continuation of <i>sura 8 </i>(<i>spoils of war</i>)—during compilation of 
	the Qur’an (probably, during Uthmanic compilation), this <i>sura (sura 9)</i> 
	was separated out from <i>sura 8</i>. There are no word/words holier than 
	those two words. In Islamic parlance those two words are of supreme 
	importance in almost all religious rituals. Truly, <i>Bismi Allah </i>are 
	the key words which unravel the mystery of Allah.<br>
	<br>
	<b><i>Bismi Allah</i></b> words are routine incantation in Islamic rituals, 
	such as: attending a prayer, marriage, eating, drinking, reading, writing, 
	sleeping, waking up, walking down, seating down, standing up, running, 
	playing, urinating, kissing, copulating, sitting for an examination, 
	visiting a doctor, setting out on a journey–.and whatnot. The only times 
	these two extraordinarily holy words are not invoked are: Islamic beheading, 
	slaughtering an animal, waging a war (<i>Jihad)</i>, defecating and visiting 
	graves. The words used in these occasions are; <b><i>Allahu Akbar</i></b><i>.</i> 
	Thanks to the Islamist terrorists and the snuff videos on Islamic beheading 
	and decapitation shown in the Internet, I do not have to write much about 
	these two other hallowed words of Islam. The world has already associated 
	these two words (I mean <i>Allahu Akbar)</i> with terror, evil and murder. 
	Curiously, one might notice that the most consecrated words, i.e. <i>Bismi 
	Allah</i> are not announced during the cacophony of Islamic cry for prayer (<i>Azan).
	</i>Instead, we hear <i>Allahu Akbar</i> (three times) at the beginning and 
	towards the end.<br>
	<br>
	<i>Bismi Allah</i> words are not Muhammad’s invention. The pagans in Mecca 
	used those two sanctified words, though infrequently, in most of their 
	rituals as they also considered Allah to be their supreme deity or God. They 
	called this ritual <i>Tasmiya.</i> Its probable origin is from the Jewish 
	custom of invoking <i>HaShem</i> when they recited the Torah. It is not 
	clear, who invented this custom—but it is certainly Muhammad who steadfastly 
	instituted this tradition (invoking <i>Bismi Allah)</i> as a compulsory 
	universal practice for the Muslims. As you proceed diligently with this 
	essay, you will understand why Muhammad had made it obligatory to cite <i>
	Bismi Allah </i>in every occasion I mentioned previously.<br>
	<br>
	Thus, it is important that we meticulously dissect these two valuable words:
	<i>Bismi Allah,</i> which are the roots of all Islamic acts. This will help 
	us to understand the mindset of Allah, which in turn is the key in 
	understanding the state of mind of Muhammad and his religion, Islam. This is 
	the prime focus of this essay—to decipher an esoteric Allah and His 
	inseparable partner Muhammad.</font></font></p>

	<font size="2">Special Thanks<br>
	</font></span></b><font size="2">During the last few months I have received 
	many e–mails from readers who were very curious to know why I have been so 
	silent. I am so flabbergasted by their show of sincere warmth, unbound 
	encouragement and good advice, that I shall be doing injustice to these 
	readers if I fail to formally thank them for their genuine love, affection 
	and understanding. I never knew that my writings could move people. I 
	thought my essays were trash—to be thrown in the dustbin of history. The 
	only rewards, so far, I received were hate mails—hundreds of them and 
	threats to kill me—just for speaking my mind. So, when I read e–mails from 
	those readers who truthfully demonstrate their empathy for me, it brings 
	much ardor in me—the ardor to continue with my pen. I feel very emotional 
	reading those heartfelt e–mails. A few readers were concerned about my 
	safety when the Islamist terrorists issued death <i>fatwa</i> to slaughter 
	us. Their list also included me. To these genuine well–wishers, I would like 
	to extend a big thank.—You are the persons for whom I would like to leave 
	all my dedications—so posterity will not forget what we stood up for, –a 
	world devoid of religious anarchy and religious bigotry. You are the

	<font face="Verdana"><b>Allah is for real.<font size="2"><br>
	<br>
	</font></b><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">Muslims often think of their 
	God, Allah, to be someone who is omnipresent, omnipotent, shapeless, 
	infallible, ever&#8209;awake and rules the world through His absolute commandments 
	as enshrined in the holy Qur’an. According to many Islamist apologists, none 
	could comprehend the nature and extent of Allah, the Islamic God. Many of 
	these erudite scholars write prolix essays filled with Islamic drivels. They 
	will write, extolling various features of the invisible, vacuous, 
	incomprehensible and impenetrable Allah. Imbued with utmost devotion to 
	Allah, many Muslims, five times a day, will seek bounty and forgiveness from 
	Him. What do you think this mean? Obviously, there is some kind of 
	contradiction here. On one hand, during conversing loosely, they will 
	portray the concept of Allah as someone who is unreal and ephemeral, while 
	during prayer they will consider Allah to be like a real entity who has eyes 
	to see, ears to hear and has the physical means to deliver to the faithful 
	all their requests. So, what is the correct situation—a non-physical, 
	unreal, unseen, ephemeral Allah or a real, temporal, physical deity? Believe 
	it or not: when we search the Islam’s main sources: the Qur’an, Hadith, 
	Sirah (Muhammad’s biography) and Sharia, we invariably derive one simple 
	conclusion—that Allah, truly is for real, that He, Himself had written the 
	Qur’an with His own hands and that He, truly metes out justice and bounties 
	with His own hands. <br>
	<br>
	To begin with, an impeccable Islamic scholar, Ali Dashti contends that most 
	Islamic scholars believe that just </font></span><font size="2">like human 
	beings Allah has limbs and organs (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/068.qmt.html">68:42</a>).<span lang="EN-GB">This 
	means: Allah is anthropomorphic!—with real hands, eyes, ears, legs, feet and 
	body! Quoting from an immaculate Islamic source (Abu ‘Amer), Ali Dashti says 
	that according to real Islam Allah has limbs and organs like a human being. 
	Abu ‘Amer uses verse 68:42 to describe the true nature of Allah. Here is 
	what Dashti writes: <br>
	<br>
	Abu ‘Amer ol–Qorashi, a Moor from Majorca who died at Baghdad in 524/1130, 
	declared that it was heretical to understand the sentence “There is nothing 
	similar to Him” in verse 9 of <i>sura 42(osh–Showra)</i> (this is verse 
	42:11in the Qur’an translation of Yusuf Ali—author’s note) as meaning what 
	it says; it meant, in his opinion, that nothing resembles God in respect of 
	His divinity, because “God possesses limbs and organs like yours and mine.” 
	As proof of God’s possession of such limbs and organs, Abu ‘Amer ol-Qorashi 
	cited the description of the last judgement in verse 42 of <i>sura </i>&nbsp;68
	<i>(ol-Qalam)</i> “On the day when the leg will be bared and they will he 
	bidden to kneel but cannot,” and then slapped his thigh and said, “God has 
	legs just like mine.” </span>(Dashti, 1994, p.158)<br>
	<br>
	</font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="2">That’s right. Allah has limbs and 
	organs just like us—the human beings, which He had created with His own 
	hands. Here are those two verses which confirm that Allah is truly 
	anthropomorphic.&nbsp;</font></span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="line-height: 1.2" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Sourcing Imam Ahmad b. 
	Taymiya, one of the highest among the Islamic scholars, Dashti further 
	writes that he (Ibn Taymiya) repudiated Ghazali (the most celebrated Islamic 
	scholar—many Muslims consider Ghazali’s work as next to the Qur’an) who did 
	not have a clear idea about Allah—believing that Allah is not a physical 
	entity. Ibn Taymiya even called Ghazali a heretic. Ibn Taymiya strongly 
	believed that Allah is really anthropomorphic! He will step down from His

	<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Many Moslems, however, have 
	had rigid minds. Such men only accepted interpretations which are confirmed 
	by Hadiths, and they considered any use of reason in religious matters to be 
	misleading and impermissible. They took the above quoted Qur’anic phrases 
	literally and believed that God possesses a head, mouth, eyes, ears, hands, 
	and feet just like those of human being. In the opinion of Abu Ma’mar 
	al–Hodhali (d. 236/850), a preacher in Baghdad, anyone who denied this 
	belief was an infidel. Adherents of the school of the famous traditionist 
	and lawyer Ahmad b. Hanbal (164/780–241/855) have stuck to the same 
	unthinking literalism ever since. The school’s chief later exponent, Ahmad 
	b. Taymiya, was so fanatical that he called the Mo’tazelites infidels and 
	Ghazali a heretic; on one celebrated occasion, after quoting the Qor’an in a 
	sermon, he said to the congregation as he stepped down from the pulpit of 
	the Great Mosque at Damascus, “God will step down from His throne in the 
	same way as I am stepping down from this pulpit.” </span>.(Dashti, 1994, p.

	pronounced (loudly):&quot; There is no god but Allah, Allah is the Greatest.&quot; 
	Thereupon Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, you are not 
	supplicating One Who is deaf or absent. He said: Abu Musa or Abdullah b 
	Qais, should I not direct you to the words (which form) the treasure of 
	Paradise? I said: Allah's Messenger, what are these? He said:&quot; There is no 
	might and no power but that of Allah.&quot;</span>&nbsp;</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">‘Ubayy b. Ka’b (Allah be pleased with him) 
	reported that Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon&nbsp; him 
	said, “The first person with whom Allah will shake hands (on the Day of 
	Judgment), will be ‘Umar and he will be the first man to whom Allah will pay 
	salutation (say: <i>Assalamu ‘alaika</i>) and he will be the first man whom 
	he will hold with his Hand and make him enter the Paradise.</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2">According to Al-Zawa’id, its <i>isnad</i> is
	<i>&nbsp;daif.</i> It contains in it Dawud b. ‘Ata al&#8209;Madani and all the scholars 
	are unanimous about his <i>du’f</i> (weakness). The other transmitters are 
	reliable and sound. As&#8209;Suyuti has said, “Hafiz ‘Imad ud-Din b. Kathir in his
	<i>Jami al&#8209;Masanid has said: </i>This hadith is highly munkar (disagreeable) 
	and is not far from being a maudu (fabricated) <i>hadith</i>.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="line-height: 1.2" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">In case we are wondering about the content of 
	the second paragraph of this hadith, here is the explanation. According to 
	Ibn Majah, a person, named Dawud b ‘Ata al&#8209;Madani who is one of the 
	narrators of this hadith is not a very reliable narrator of hadith. The 
	other narrators are reliable and the text of the hadith is acceptable, 
	though this might be weak. Another opinion is that this hadith could be 
	fabricated.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="line-height: 1.2" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">The bottom line is: though this hadith might 
	be weak and controversial there is no compelling reason to reject this 
	hadith, out&#8209;of&#8209;hand, or render it totally un&#8209;authentic. At best, it is 
	controversial; at worst it is a weak hadith, but not completely 
	inauthentic.&nbsp;</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Here is another proof from 
	the holy Qur’an that Allah does indeed have physical eyes to see what His 
	Prophets are doing. In fact, Allah instructed Noah to construct an arc right 
	in front of His eyes. After inspecting Noah’s accomplishment, Allah vouched 
	the complete annihilation of the wrong-doers.</span></font></p>
