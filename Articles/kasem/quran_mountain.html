    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center" align="center">
    <font color="#800000"><b>By <a href="index.html">Abul Kasem</a></b></font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Of late, <b>
	<a href="KoranMountain.pdf">an unnamed Islamist posted an article (in 
	Vinnomot) on the Mountain building</a></b>---Qur’anic style, of course. He 
	even cited the works of an American Professor Emeritus and a former 
	President of the National Academy of Sciences to demonstrate that the Qur’an 
	is correct in asserting that mountains are implanted with pegs buried deep 
	under earth to stabilize the mother earth---so that it does not fly 
	away---so to say. I read the essay with hilarity and was amazed at the 
	chutzpah of the Islamists to play with their inane argument, hoping that the 
	gullible readers will not discover their tricks. Having taught Basic Geology 
	for a number of years I can demolish all of their contention by elucidating 
	the mighty theories of <b>Plate Tectonics</b> and <b>Continental Drift</b>, 
	the two primary forces that shape our planet: everything in it, including 
	all the mountains and the oceans. Unfortunately this scholarly discussion 
	will be too heavy for the general readers---they will soon lose interest 
	when the technicality and the science involved are presented. Here I shall 
	tell, very briefly, how nature forms mountains and shapes and reshapes our 
	landscape for eternity. In fact,&nbsp; even a High school kid will tell you that 
	the formidable force that creates our landscape are a series of convection 
	cells on the lithosphere that continually move up and down, taking along 
	with them magma and mantle from the outer core of the earth. This is a cycle 
	and what we see today on lithosphere is actually the result of activities of 
	these convection cells. Observe how water boils in a container---by the 
	continuous up and down movement of tiny water particles that circulate the 
	heat everywhere in the container---and you will understand how all the 
	Tectonic activities on earth’s surface take place. In the case of boiling 
	water the process is just a few minutes---in case of earth, it is millions 
	of years: this is the only difference.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;Observing this phenomenon, geologists 
	have formulated the theory of Plate Tectonic followed by the concept of 
	Continental Drift. Plate Tectonic activity can be viewed as the result of 
	the convection cells that causes land transformation, and Continental Drift 
	is the slow process of moving of land masses and the creation of mountains, 
	oceans, seas, lakes etc. Booth of these processes works together to shape 
	and –reshape our landscape. Except for occasional violent volcanic 
	activities, human life-span, unfortunately, is too short to observe or 
	experience any such formation: it takes millions of years for any such event 
	to materialize---and it is an extremely slow process—beyond our perception. 
	Weathering and denudation are other associated causes by which today's 
	mountains might disappear in a few million years.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;We teach Alfred Wegener's theory of 
	Continental drift to our students. This theory, along with the theory of 
	Plate Tectonics, forms the foundation of modern geology. If, what this 
	Islamists wrote, citing one Professor's opinion is to be taken as true then 
	the entire geology syllabus and all the current geology books become 
	completely redundant; instead, we have to teach the Qur'an and Hadith as the 
	basis of geology, come to think of it!</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;It is possible for a mountain to be 
	formed from the eruption/explosion of volcanoes in land or even under ocean. 
	Some geologists speculate that regular, huge volcanic eruptions do take 
	place under the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, the results of which may, 
	one day be, new land masses and mountains and the further drifting apart of 
	the African and the South American continents. If someone calls the 
	underside of these mountains as pegs then that is fine. It is similar to the 
	base of anything---even a tree has a base, same goes for any terrestrial 
	object---even the oceans have their bases! </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;On the other hand, a mountain can also 
	be erased by the relentless action of weathering, their base might remain 
	intact. When we drill out rock cores from underneath and study them closely 
	this truth emerges absolutely. As an example, the entire Sydney basin was a 
	mountain range, now has been rendered into a flat plain. How come Allah 
	forgot to mention how, He too, removes the mighty mountains---slowly and 
	steadily? The answer, of course is Allah had no knowledge of what Alfred 
	Wegener, the German geophysicist discovered and Allah was completely dumb on 
	the issue of omnipresent weathering actions that are in work forever to 
	change the surface of the earth. Therefore, how is it possible to maintain 
	stability if today’s mountain is removed?</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">I am curious why this Professor does 
	not write a new text book based on the Qur’anic theory of mountain 
	formation.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;As stated previously, the principal 
	cause/s that shapes our earth’s surface are two important geological 
	theories: Plate Tectonics and Continental Drift. These concepts are the 
	foundation of modern geology. Mountains are never viewed as the stabilizing 
	objects/forces. The highest mountain, like the Himalayan range was formed 
	when the Indian plate collided with the Asian plate around 50 million years 
	ago. It is believed that India was connected with Antarctica and 
	Australiasia about 300 million years ago. Then the plate separated and the 
	Indian continent started drifting northwards. When it collided with the 
	Asian plate the sea level rose and the mountain range formed from the bottom 
	of the sea. The evidence is that, high at the top of Himalayan the 
	geologists have discovered fossils of sea creatures, thus proving 
	conclusively that the Himalayan rose from the bottom of the sea. The other 
	truth is that the Himalyaya is the youngest mountain range in the world. It 
	is not finished yet--the height of Himalayan mountain- peaks are still 
	rising. This means that the seal level is rising. So how is it possible to 
	provide stability under this situation? Can we not therefore say that the 
	idea that the mountains provide stability to the land mass does not arise at 
	al?. Furthermore, based on the Continental Drift pattern the geophysicists 
	have even constructed how the earth landscape will look like fifty million 
	years in future. It is anything from what we see today, believe it or not! 
	The Australian continent will move closer to Japan, the Indian sub-continent 
	will mover further eastward and the Africa and South America will drift 
	apart further---increasing the expanse of the Atlantic and the Pacific 
	Oceans! Mind you, when the land masses move they move along with all their 
	mountain ranges, oceans, lakes---everything on them. So what happens to the 
	stability of the earth? May I ask this simple question to the unnamed 
	Islamist?</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;The anonymous Islamist wrote, without 
	any authentic reference: “Likewise, the modern Plate Tectonics holds that 
	mountain work as stabilizers for the earth.” I would request him to provide 
	evidence of such a claim by Plate Tectonics theorists.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&nbsp;There are excellent articles on Plate 
	Tectonic and Continental Drift in the Internet. Just type those two key 
	words in Google-search and you will find hundreds of articles with excellent 
	sketches and photographs. When you peruse one of these articles you will, 
	for sure, discover how false the Islamists’ claims are</p>
