	2<sup>nd</sup> pledge of Aqaba along with other ansars from Medina and was 
	one of the first persons in Medina to accept Islam. He was Muhammad’s 
	greatest confidante’ and a saviour in troubled times. Whenever Muhammad 
	would forget some verses of the Qur’an or he would want some explanation on 
	some verses he would seek the help of Ubayy. This dependence of Muhammad on 
	Ubayy reflects that he (Ubayy b. Ka’b) was the real writer of Muhammad’s 
	dictations, and Ubayy wrote whatever he fancied—subject, of course to 
	Muhammad’s approval. Residing in Medina, where a sizeable thriving Jewish 
	community lived, he was profoundly knowledgeable in Jewish scriptures and 
	Jewish laws. Most likely, he wrote many of the Medina Suras that deal with 
	Islamic legal provisions. These Medina Suras are not as poetically 
	enchanting as the Meccan Suras are. This is because Ubayy b. Ka’b was not 
	really a poet but a politician and a scribe. In fact, he wrote his own 
	version of the Qur’an which he refused to surrender when, during Uthman’s 
	time, all versions of the Qur’an, except that of Hafsa’s were proscribed and 
	burned. Ubayy b. Ka’b and ibn Masud refused to surrender their Mushaf 
	(Qur’an written on leaves) and kept them in secret.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-AU">Bibi Aisha was Muhammad’s most favourite wife. He married 
	her when she was just a child of six years and had sex with her when she was 
	merely nine years old. The youth, the vivacity, the tenderness, the 
	child-like innocence and the childhood exuberance—these were the ingredients 
	that consumed Muhammad’s mind in the adoration of Aisha’s gullibility. As a 
	child-bride Aisha was completely dependent on Muhammad’s maturity. Like any 
	other child of her age she believed in whatever Muhammad told her about his 
	divine inspiration. Muhammad claimed that he used to get revelations from 
	Allah only when he slept with Aisha. Why Gabriel did not bother to visit him 
	when he spent nights with other wives in his harem? This is a question very 
	few Islamic scholars/historians have answered. The truth is: except for 
	Aisha, all other wives of Muhammad were grown up, matured and had experience 
	with the trials, tribulations and crookedness of life in general. Some of 
	them already had grown-up children. It was not so simple for Muhammad to 
	convince this retinue of women about his communication with Allah via 
	Gabriel. They would not simply believe so easily in Muhammad’s made-up 
	stories. Although they were forced to live in his harem, nonetheless, they 
	could not, deep in their mind, endorse all the claims of Muhammad. So, 
	evidently Aisha, with her child-like simplicity and innocence became 
	Muhammad’s source of divine inspiration! Muhammad was simply playing with a 
	child’s mind which tends to believe all sorts of Ghost and Jinn stories, 
	Santa Klaus, winged horses, devils, monsters and all mythological and 
	fictional characters. The following <i>ahadith</i> from <i>Sahih Bukhari</i> 
	confirms that Allah communicated with Muhammad only when he slept with 
	Aisha:</span></font></p>

	<p style="margin-left:.5in" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-AU">The wives of Allah's Apostle were in two groups. One 
	group consisted of 'Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group 
	consisted of Um Salama and the other wives of Allah's Apostle. The Muslims 
	knew that Allah's Apostle loved 'Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and 
	wished to give to Allah's Apostle, he would delay it, till Allah's Apostle 
	had come to 'Aisha's home and then he would send his gift to Allah's Apostle 
	in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and 
	decided that Um Salama should request Allah's Apostle to tell the people to 
	send their gifts to him in whatever wife's house he was. Um Salama told 
	Allah's Apostle of what they had said, but he did not reply. Then they 
	(those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She said, &quot;He did not say anything 
	to me.&quot; They asked her to talk to him again. She talked to him again when 
	she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked her, she 
	replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, &quot;Talk to him till he 
	gives you a reply.&quot; When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then 
	said to her, &quot;Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do 
	not come to me on any of the beds except that of Aisha.&quot; On that Um Salama 
	said, &quot;I repent to Allah for hurting you.&quot; Then the group of Um Salama 
	called Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle and sent her to Allah's 
	Apostle to say to him, &quot;Your wives request to treat them and the daughter of 
	Abu Bakr on equal terms.&quot; Then Fatima conveyed the message to him. The 
	Prophet said, &quot;O my daughter! Don't you love whom I love?&quot; She replied in 
	the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested 
	her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who 
	went to him and used harsh words saying, &quot;Your wives request you to treat 
	them and the daughter of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.&quot; On that she raised 
	her voice and abused 'Aisha to her face so much so that Allah's Apostle 
	looked at 'Aisha to see whether she would retort. 'Aisha started replying to 
	Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at 'Aisha and said, 
	&quot;She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&quot; </span></font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">Ya'la b. Umayya 
	reported on the authority of his father (Allah be pleased with them) that a 
	person came to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as he was at 
	Ji'rana and he (the person) had been putting on a cloak which was perfumed, 
	or he (the narrator) said: There was a trace of yellowness on it. He said 
	(to the Holy Prophet): What do you command me to do during my Umra? (It was 
	at this juncture) that the revelation came to the Apostle of Allah (way 
	peace be upon him) and he was covered with a cloth, and Ya'la said: Would 
	that I see revelation coming to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon 
	him). He (Hadrat 'Umar) said: Would it please you to see the Apostle of 
	Allah (may peace be upon him) receiving the revelations 'Umar lifted a 
	corner of the cloth and I looked at him and he was emitting a sound of 
	snorting. He (the narrator) said: I thought it was the sound of a camel. 
	When he was relieved of this he said: Where is he who asked about Umra? When 
	the person came, the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Wash out the 
	trace of yellowness, or he said: the trace of perfume and put off the cloak 
	and do in your 'Umra what you do in your Hajj.</span></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-AU">That was how 
	Allah talked to Muhammad--through the ‘bleating’ of a camel!</span></font></p>

	<span style="font-size: 18.0pt">&nbsp;</span></b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lastly, as a final 
	proof that Muhammad corrected/inserted/deleted the contents of a verse as 
	situation demanded and/or as people requested, here is the example of Ibn 
	Umm Maktum, a blind man of Mecca. He requested Muhammad to correct a verse 
	to exempt a blind person to join in a <i>Jihad</i>. This blind man used to 
	listen to Muhammad’s preaching and wanted to discuss with him certain 
	aspects of Islam. However, Muhammad, at first, ignored him, but later he 
	became very remorseful for neglecting this blind man. So Allah, in Sura 
	al-Abasa (He frowned) (Sura 80, chronological order 24) reproached Muhammad. 
	Ibn Umm Maktum eventually converted to Islam and became a very close 
	companion of Muhammad. When Muhammad exhorted the superiority of those who 
	participates in Jihad or Holy war this blind man was reluctant to 
	participate in such fighting and wanted an exemption. During the writing of 
	this verse (4:95) Muhammad forgot about the blind man. So Ibn Umm Maktum 
	reminded him of his case. Accordingly, Muhammad quickly changed his verse.</font></p>

	a slaughtered camel) and inscribed it (the verse) thereon. The son of Umm

	<span lang="EN-AU">The Holy Qur’an is not authored by almighty Allah. Allah, 
	if He ever existed, must be busy with many other important matters. He has 
	no time to write an incoherent, ambiguous, repetitive, erroneous scripture 
	to guide mankind. A few ambitious and opportunistic persons, in the name of 
	Allah gathered together under the tutelage of Muhammad to construct the 
	Qur’an by adapting, amending and outright plagiarizing other scriptures and 
	heresy of the time. This they did to advance and perpetuate their political 
	ambition to dominate the then Arabian peninsula, and later, many other 
	peaceful countries. Qur’an is the handiwork of a few cunning persons—an 
	attempt to fool the gullible world—a deliberate effort to impose Arab 
	superiority. All Muslims must learn the Arabic language to be able to recite 
	the Qur’an and to offer prayers, adopt Arabic name and conform to Islamic 
	(read Bedouin Arab) culture. This is naked Arab imperialism in the guise of 
	propagating the message of the ‘Holy Qur’an’. Any Islamic Paradise will 
	confirm to what I have written just now. When the undeniable truth about the 
	authorship of the Qur’an and its hidden scheme is clearly understood, this 
	Arab imperialism by the stealth stands out to be the main agenda of the 
	Qur’an.</span></font></p>
