  Islam</font></h3>
  <p align="center"><font size="4">By <a href="index.html">Abul Kasem</a></font></p>
  <p>There is a new breed of Islamic writers gracing the Internet with their new 
  brand of a tolerant and companionate Islam. These new writers are mostly 
  western educated, live in western societies, work in western countries, and 
  raise their children in the West. They are sophisticated, articulate, smart 
  and knowledgeable. However, they are quite fiercely Islam minded. They write 
  extremely lengthy essays on Islam and spare no pain to portray Islam as a 
  religion of peace, tolerance, mercy, compassion, justice, humane and what not? 
  You just name the good adjective and it is there in Islam. Reading such prolix 
  essays could be strenuous and tiring, to say the least. However, if you have 
  the patience to go through these enormous writings, you may be confused to 
  think that these writers sound almost like secularists and freethinkers! In 
  fact, if they did not include the lengthy quotes from the holy books we might 
  even think that they are not really Islamists. Some of these Islamists even 
  blame the Hadiths for such a sordid state of affairs in Islam by saying that 
  it is the creation of human whereas, Qur'an is the creation of Supreme Lord. 
  Thus, according to these writers not all Hadiths are authentic. How 
  outrageous! Have they forgotten that rejecting a single word of Qur'an and 
  Hadith is an act of apostasy and punishable by death?</p>
  <p>So, why these new writers are so desperate to show to the world how 
  beautiful the religion of Islam is? Their background answers the question. You 
  see, by living in secular and freethinking western countries, they really 
  wished that their religion conformed to the principles of secularism, 
  democracy and freethinking. Alas! That is not an easy thing to expect from 
  Islam. When they see how much inhumanity, bigotry, irrationality and tyranny 
  is there in Islam, they simply feel ashamed of their religion. They know very 
  well that those images of Islam cannot simply be refuted. They have only two 
  choices, agree with these practices of Islam and turn into an Islamic 
  fundamentalist or defend Islam by whatever means. They have very little 
  courage to be a fundamentalist/ Jehadis because they like the creature comfort 
  of this western lifestyle. At the same time, they are afraid to go against 
  their faith. Therefore, they start to reinvent their faith. While they are at 
  it, they reinvent many things in their religion. They will quote those verses 
  from the holy books that are benign, tolerant, merciful, etc. These verses of 
  the Qur'an were actually from that period when Islam was weak and had a 
  handful of followers. The Muslims were then dependent upon the mercy of the 
  non-believers. And that is what is reflected in these rather tame verses. When 
  Islam became a bit stronger and the Prophet (pbuh) found that his dogma can 
  really be forced upon people through fear, intimidation and slaughter, the 
  verses of Qur'an became fiercer and frightening with no tone of mercy and 
  compassion, whatsoever. However, these new writers will never tell this truth 
  to the readers. If we quote those violent and cruel verses of Quran and seek 
  an explanation on them, these Islamists simply keep quiet or just ignore the 
  questions. But they do not fail to give their own interpretation many other 
  issues. An example is the case of Hila marriage. Readers have learnt plenty 
  about the Hila marriage by now through various sources and from the 
  fundamentalists. However, these neo-Islamists have come to their own 
  conclusions on this matter by saying that Hila marriage is not Islamic. What a 
  joke! Another issue is the death penalty for apostates. These writers are 
  really ashamed of this provision in Islam. Nonetheless, to save face they 
  simply ignore this issue and write that changing one's faith is not an act of 
  apostasy. The examples are communists, secularists, atheists, etc. They even 
  let you have the impression that a Muslim is free to choose any religion. Of 
  course, they are dead wrong on both these matters. Any person who spends a 
  little time searching the web (for example www.golshan.com) will find out how 
  wrong these new inventors of Islam are. In essence, these re-inventors of 
  Islam are actually issuing fatwas that suit their purposes. If this trend 
  continues, then there will be as many brands of Islam as there are Muslims in 
  the world! This is not an understatement either.</p>
  <p>If we ask these scribes who are the true Islamists and where can we find 
  them, we get strange answers. Is Golam Azam, a true Islamist? No. Saddam 
  Hussein? Rubbish. Talibans? Of course, not. Ayatollah? Hell, no! Maulana 
  Azizul Haq? What the hell you're talking about? . Maulana Fazlul Haq Amini? 
  Are you out of your mind? Is Saudi Arabia a true Islamic country? How absurd? 
  How about Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Sudan? No. No. No. True Islam has not 
  yet been invented! After the Prophet it seems that there were no true 
  followers of Islam and so far no true Islamic country have been established. 
  What these writers really want to say is that only they (the writers) are the 
  true followers of Islam. The rest are not. How do the readers feel with this 
  attitude of these new pundits? I can tell one truth, though. The truth is that 
  these professors of Islamic jurisprudence and Islamic history should consider 
  themselves very lucky indeed for residing and writing in a secular country. If 
  they happen to be in any Islamic country, they will surely have trouble with 
  the Islamic authorities for interpreting the religion in their own way and 
  possibly face harsh sentences.</p>
  <p>Let us not be fooled by these writers. They try to confuse those believers 
  of Islam who had no opportunity to learn the bitter truth about Islam and 
  still believe in the purity and the divinity of the religion. These writers 
  try to blur people's eyes from their twenty-twenty vision. They try to give a 
  mystic and kind image of Islam, which is non-existent, so that innocent 
  gullible people still cling to their age-old faith.</p>
  <p>How absurd it is that the neo-Islamists have recently coined a new term. It 
  is 'secular fundamentalism.' What a great display of intellectual apathy! To 
  be a fundamentalist one must be a strict follower of a Scripture be that holy 
  or unholy. I would like to ask these Islamists what is the Scripture that the 
  secularists hold as pure and holy? They have also invented a new term called 
  'religious (Islamic) science'. Oh my! What a great compliment to science! 
  After failing to defend the so-called scientific truths in Qur'an and Hadiths, 
  they had no other choice but to invent their own brand of science (read voodoo 
  science). They want to give the impression that the rigid methodologies used 
  by modern science to verify facts and to establish scientific principles and 
  laws are not Islamic. I would like to ask them a simple question. Please tell 
  us just one scientific principle that is disclosed in Qur'an. Please do not 
  use mumbo jumbo words and threadbare boring tricks of difficulty with 
  translation of Qur'an. We are fed up with these flimsy excuses. Tell us please 
  where in the Qur'an we can find the laws of gravitation, laws of planetary 
  rotation, principle of atomic structure of matters, the periodic table of 
  elements, principles of relativity, geological science and the modern science 
  of space/rocket technology and inter-planetary travel, and elucidation of 
  genetic code.</p>
  <p>Readers, have you noticed that these Islamists often resort to personal 
  attacks and flimsy pretexts when they cannot refute an argument by rational 
  thinking? Very often they will find spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, 
  punctuation errors and will delve in dictionary meanings of many words used by 
  the secularist writers. This had really happened to some of my essays. One 
  Islamist wrote to me that I had very little education since I made errors in 
  spelling the word 'hypocrate'. These people will not accept that typing errors 
  are very common. As for grammar, even Shakespeare made plenty of errors. How 
  about Qur'an? Are there any grammatical and/or spelling errors in the Qur'an? 
  I am not an expert in Arabic. So, I shall refrain from making any comment on 
  this. But I would like to have an answer to this question, if I may.</p>
  <p>Let us now turn to the other group of Islamists, that is the fundamentalist 
  Islamists. I hardly need elaboration on this because the whole world is 
  familiar with them. Humanity recognises them as the ultimate symbol of 
  backwardness, misogynist, intolerance, bigotry, terror and oppression. But I 
  must admit that these fundamentalists are absolutely honest in what they 
  preach and what they want to achieve. They do not deviate from the source of 
  all their actions, that is Qur'an and Sunnah (Hadith). In fact, these 
  fundamentalists have shown the truth about Islam without any pretext or using 
  intellectual summersault. They have exposed Islam plain and simple without any 
  apology. Amongst many other things, they have demonstrated that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A mosque is really a place for murder, execution and a depot for 
    hoarding arms and ammunition (Pakistan and Bangladesh) </li>
    <li>Women are nothing but child making machines (Taliban) </li>
    <li>Changing one's mind on Islam invokes death sentence (Iran, Taliban, 
    Sudan) </li>
    <li>Stoning to death for adultery (Iran, Taliban) </li>
    <li>Cutting off hands and feet for petty thieves (Taliban) </li>
    <li>Possession of Bible invites death sentence (Saudi Arabia) </li>
    <li>Premarital sex between Muslim couple is punishable with lashes, but 
    having sex with infidel women is okay </li>
    <li>Toilet paper is haram (don't laugh) even though our prophet used stones 
    for the same purpose. This is the recent fatwa from the Talibans. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>One can extend the above list to include more absurdities. There are many 
  more. It is quite easy to see why it becomes simple to deal with the 
  fundamentalists. Their thoughts and actions are very straight forward just 
  like the <i>Sirat-ul-Mustaqim</i>. They have no pretence of decency and smooth 
  talk. Their actions have produced worldwide condemnation. But they don't care. 
  They are blind to their faith and carry out their actions to the letter of 
  their Holy Scriptures. They are not wolves in sheep's skin. They are out and 
  wolves and it is quite simple to identify them and take necessary steps to 
  counter them. In a way these fundamentalists make the job of the secularists 
  and freethinkers simple and straightforward.</p>
  <p>But the neo-Islamists are different breed altogether. They really hate the 
  fundamentalists for tarnishing the beautiful image of Islam. They are 
  desperate to prove to the world that Islam is not what the fundamentalists 
  project to the civilised world. The neo-Islamists are absolutely bent upon 
  proving that Islam is in sympathy with secular thoughts. Thus, the fight to 
  free humanity from the clutches of Islamic slavery becomes difficult with the 
  presence of these Islamists. Many people may think that there may still be a 
  true Islam somewhere, which is not as savage as the fundamentalists 
  demonstrate. Clearly, these neo Islamists try to put a coloured glass in the 
  eyes of the ordinary Muslims to obscure their views from the clear and true 
  picture of Islam.</p>
  <p>Qur'an and Hadiths are so ambiguous that it is quite possible to prove 
  anything and possibly every thing by quoting from them. If you have time to 
  search, you can really find whatever you want from these sources. I do not 
  want to burden the readers by quoting endlessly from Qur'an and Hadiths about 
  the various issues I have raised in this essay. However, I cannot help but to 
  quote the following Hadith for the readers to judge the quality of mercy and 
  compassion practiced in Islam.</p>
  <p>Sunan Abu-Dawud Book38, Number 4348</p>
  <i>
  <p>&quot;Narrated Abdullah Ibn Abbas:</p>
  <p>A blind man had a slave-mother who used to abuse the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and 
  disparage him. He forbade her but she did not stop. He rebuked her but she did 
  not give up her habit. One night she began to slander the Prophet (p.b.u.h) 
  and abuse him. So he took a dagger, placed it on her belly, pressed it, and 
  killed her. A child who came between her legs was smeared with the blood that 
  was there. When the morning came, the prophet (p.b.u.h) was informed about it.</p>
  <p>He assembled the people and said: I adjure by Allah the man has done this 
  action and adjure him by my right to him that he should stand up. Jumping over 
  the necks of the people and trembling the man stood up. He sat before the 
  prophet (p.b.u.h) and said: Apostle of Allah! I am here master; she used to 
  abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her but she did not stop, and I rebuked 
  her, but she did not abandon her habit. I have two sons like pearls from her, 
  and she was my companion. Last night she began to abuse and disparage you. So 
  I took a dagger, put it at her belly and pressed it till I killed her.</p>
  <p>Thereupon the prophet (p.b.u.h) said:Oh be witness, no retaliation is 
  payable for her blood&quot;.</p>
  </i>
  <p>A few weeks ago, I met a friend of mine who had spent a lengthy period in 
  Saudi Arabia. Although not a fundamentalist Islamist, he is quite a religious 
  person. He told me that recently he went to Bangladesh and got his daughter 
  married there. Now he is trying to bring his brand new son-in-law to Australia 
  as a spouse of his daughter. I was very curious to know why is it that her 
  daughter did not follow her husband to Bangladesh so that the new couple could 
  raise a family in a proper Islamic environment. His answer was quite 
  interesting. He said, &quot;When we are in an Islamic society (like Bangladesh or 
  Saudi Arabia), we do not like Islam. We like Islam when we are in a 
  non-Islamic society (like Australia)&quot;. I must appreciate his honesty in 
  telling his inner feelings about Islam. Is not his statement a great tribute 
  to all the secularists and the freethinkers of the world?
