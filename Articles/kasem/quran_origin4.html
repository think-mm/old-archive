	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">Bahira was a 
	Nestorian Christian monk who lived in Sham (Syria). His Christian name was 
	Sergius or Georgius. It is believed that he was expelled from the monastery 
	for certain offences. To expiate it, he set out on a mission to Arabia. In 
	Mecca, he met Muhammad, became intimate with him and stayed with him. He had 
	confidential conversation with Muhammad, in which he surely told Muhammad 
	many facets of Christianity. The verses in the Qur’an dealing with 
	Christianity must have emanated from Bahira, the monk. Muhammad simply 
	re-wrote them with the help of his Qur’an collectors or scribes.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">It is believed that

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">It is not clear why 
	Bahira was expelled from the Syrian church. Could it be that he held views 
	on Christianity that was blasphemous to the Nestorian church? Or could it be

	of information on Christianity (apocryphal or main-stream) from this monk.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span lang="EN-AU">It is interesting to 
	note that Qur’an mentions itself that Muhammad was, in fact, taught by a 
	foreigner, but Allah tried to deny the truth by implying that the language 
	of Muhammad and the language of the foreigner was different! This obviously, 
	is completely untrue, as we note that Muhammad, during his trip to Sham 
	(Syria) had met Bahira, and had no difficulty in communicating with him. 
	Here is the verse that says that Muhammad was taught by a foreigner:</span></p>

	inhabited Syria. They were the followers of Seth and Idris. Sabeans fasted 
	for 30 days from night to sunrise, observed Eid and prayed for the dead 
	without prostration. Muhammad simply copied their system of fasting (only 
	change made was fasting from dawn to dusk) and retained the celebration of 
	Eid and the prayer for the dead in exactly the same fashion as the Sabeans. 
	Thus the rules on fasting as prescribed in verses 2:183-187 were actually 
	adapted from the Holy Scriptures of the Sabeans. In fact, the Qur’an 
	confirms itself that the system of fasting was a copy-cat from other faith, 
	but remaining coy about which religious scripture Muhammad copied from. Here

	the Holy Scripture of the Sabeans from Bahira, the monk and from Salman, the 
	Persian, because both of them had spent a considerable amount of time in

	a Jew, then converted to Christianity. He became a devout Christian and 
	reportedly translated the Gospel in his version of Arabic. His profound 
	knowledge and understanding of the mainstream Christianity, as well as 
	Judaism, must had had profound influence on Khadijah and Muhammad. So, it 
	will be quite reasonable to surmise that Khadijah, too, was a follower of 
	Christianity—at least inwardly. We find no reference anywhere that Khadijah 
	had ever prayed to any idol or had attended any polytheist religious ritual; 
	instead, we note (as told previously) that Muhammad was, indeed, a 
	polytheist when he married Khadijah. For 25 years Khadijah was Muhammad’s 
	support (financially) and counsellor. It was most likely that Khadijah 
	influenced Muhammad to change his religion—from polytheism to Christianity. 
	Waraqa and Khadijah used to discuss lots of Christian and Jewish stuff with 
	Muhammad that made him think deeply about his belief system at birth (i.e., 
	paganism). </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-AU">Muhammad’s neighbour was an-Nadr b. al-Harith. He also 
	used to write verses similar to the Qur’an. He was also a very good 
	story-teller--especially of the ancient fables. Whenever Muhammad gathered 
	people to listen to his tales in the Qur’an an-Nadr would entice the 
	audience of Muhammad with better stories than Muhammad. Due to an-Nadr’s 
	excellent proficiency in narrating the anecdotes Muhammad saw his audience 
	disappear. Muhammad considered an-Nadr’s act extremely loathsome and had his 
	revenge taken by capturing an-Nadr in the battle of Badr and later beheading 
	him.</span></font></p>
