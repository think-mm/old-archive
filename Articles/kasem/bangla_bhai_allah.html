	<p align="justify">Al-Hamd-Lillah, Rabbul al-Amin; </p>
	<p align="justify">This is a petition to the almighty Allah, the creator, 
	the most high, the most beloved, the most compassionate, the most merciful, 
	the strictest reckoner, the most hate-filled, the most jealous, the most 
	revengeful and the ultimate judge on the resurrection day. </p>
	<p align="justify">Assalamu Alaikum </p>
	<p align="justify">I am penning this epistle from a distant corner of 
	Bangladesh which is about to become the next Taliban country in the world. 
	It seems that Allah, Rabbul al-Amin has not read the recent article in the 
	New York Times that has categorically predicated the emergence of this new 
	Islamic Paradise. However, I, Bangla Bhai, the Commander-in-Chief of the 
	Mujaheddins is now facing certain impediments while fighting in the way of 
	Allah. Therefore, I decided to forward this petition to Allah elaborating my 
	background, the plans and the logistics in the creation of this Taliban 
	State. Of late, while conducting an Islamic raid on the evil villagers, a 
	few of Allah’s soldiers (Mujahiddins) were beaten to death. </p>
	<p align="justify">Look Allah, how we buried our dear martyrs. It was in the 
	same fashion as the martyrs of the Uhud were ritually buried by your 
	devotees 1400 years ago. Please refresh your memory of Uhud. The martyrs 
	were not at all clothed in burial dress. Instead, they were buried with 
	their bloodied bodies—the very way they were killed in the battlefield. 
	Isn’t this the most commendable way to put an ardent Jihadist to ultimate 
	rest? Allah, for doing this, we surely deserve much reward from you. Just 
	observe closely how we have smartly brought back the seventh century Bedouin 
	Islami Josh (Islami zeal) on the green pastures of Bangla. Allah, have you 
	read the classic science fiction, ‘The Time Machine’, written by H.G. Wells? 
	Don’t you think we are much cleverer than this infidel writer? We are, in 
	reality, operating a time machine. This time machine is incredibly efficient 
	in taking an entire nation on a time trip—in the past, of course. Our future 
	plan is to make sure that only the true Momeen (believers) remain alive; the 
	rest of the infidels and the hypocrites must be eradicated. That is how we 
	plan to turn the luxuriance of Bangla in to a ponderous red-carpet—drenched 
	and soaked in blood. Isn’t this what you wrote in your timeless tome, the 
	Qur’an? We are absolutely in the right track for your sake. Allah, in case 
	your memory has worn out, this is what you wrote regarding the supremacy of 
	Islam in your eternal Qur’an: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">Any religion other than Islam is not acceptable...<i>3:85
		</i></p>
		<p align="justify">Allah has perfected the religion of Islam and made it 
		the only religion for mankind…<i>5:3 </i></p>
		<p align="justify">Allah curses the hypocrites, the diseased hearts; 
		wherever they are found they will be seized and slain mercilessly…<i>33:60-61
		</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify">Allah, we may not be even 1% of the population of 
	Bangladesh. But, if we follow verses quoted above, our minuscule number is 
	not going to deter us from launching our Islamic killing operations (Jihad). 
	Allah, have you forgotten how, with only twelve Mujahids, led by the Islamic 
	Commander Ikthiar Uddin b. Bakhtiar Khilji, invaded Bangla and introduced 
	the beauty of Islam there? We are just like him. Our microscopic number will 
	never deter us from capturing once again, the fertile verdure of Bengal and 
	purify Islam once and for all. We shall surely get rid (by killing) of all 
	those who are not true Islamic—the real Islam, preached and practiced by 
	your dearest Prophet. </p>
	<p align="justify">Ya Malik ed-Dunia, look at my neatly grown, untrimmed 
	beard—grown and nurtured exactly to your specification. You will find it 
	precisely similar to the beard of Rasul-e-Karim. I even dyed my beard with 
	henna. Allah, please smell my handsome beard and you will be pleased with 
	the fragrance of musk—just the way our Nabiji used to do. Please send your 
	angels to monitor our toilets and food habits. They will be surprised to 
	note the incredible effort we have put in to emulate intimately, in every 
	aspect of our lives, our most beloved Prophet. For example, despite no 
	shortage of water in Bangladesh, we use clay stones to cleanse our private 
	parts after defecating in the open field—exactly to your specifications. 
	Even though we have primitive latrines we prefer to do our business in the 
	wide open field because that was how Nabiji did during his time. See, how 
	devoted we are to your dearest Apostle! In case your memory is lacking, 
	Allah, please read this Hadis from Sahih Bukhari, the Sunna of your Prophet 
	which is compulsory for every Muslim to emulate: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i>After defecating do not use bones or dung; use 
		stones to cleanse yourself…1.4.157 </i></p>
		<p align="justify">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 157: Narrated Abu Huraira: I 
		followed the Prophet while he was going out to answer the call of 
		nature. He used not to look this way or that. So, when I approached near 
		him he said to me, &quot;Fetch for me some stones for ' cleaning the privates 
		parts (or said something similar), and do not bring a bone or a piece of 
		dung.&quot; So I brought the stones in the corner of my garment and placed 
		them by his side and I then went away from him. When he finished (from 
		answering the call of nature) he used, them . </p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><i>Use odd number of stones to clean your private 
		parts...1. 4.162 </i></p>
		<p align="justify">Volume 1, Book 4, Number 162: Narrated Abu Huraira: 
		The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever performs ablution should clean his nose with 
		water by putting the water in it and then blowing it out, and whoever 
		cleans his private parts with stones should do it with odd number of 
		stones.&quot; </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify">Allah, please check your list of infidels. I am certain 
	you will find the name of Elsie Grizzly. Recently, this vile infidel woman, 
	wearing Islamic hijab, visited the pristine Islamic Paradise of Bangladesh. 
	We were so hospitable to her when she visited me in our secret den of 
	Jihadists. Wearing a black Burqa, she conducted an interview with me. I was 
	simply elated that a white Muslimah journalist from the land of Great Satan 
	would like to publish our ‘Kamiabi’ (success) in the top-notch daily, like 
	the New York Times. Due to extreme elation, I lost my sense and hurriedly 
	told her a lot of our secret plans to perfect the Taliban state in 
	Bangladesh. When this lady journalist published our incredible story in the 
	New York Times, the world was astonished. All the ‘Harami’s (the wicked 
	people) of Bangladesh were very angry and extremely agitated. Later, we 
	quickly learned from our secret agents that she had never converted to Islam 
	but simply used that ruse to trick us. Allah, please forgive me for 
	disclosing to this Kafir woman our plan for a future Islamic Taliban State 
	in Bangladesh. The truth, Allah, was: I really became infatuated with this 
	Caucasian Muslimah even though I never saw her face. Her shrill, sexy and 
	husky voice was good enough to raise my passion for her. Once I saw her 
	handsome, delicate, smooth, shiny, impeccably manicured wrist taking notes 
	of my statements I went wild. I was ecstatic. I dearly wanted to marry her 
	and make her my third wife—just the way our Prophet always fell in love with 
	whichever woman he chanced to meet. Allah, have you forgotten that your most 
	beloved friend only had three passions—women, perfume and prayer? I follow 
	the exact footsteps of our Nabiji. Alas! Elsie Grizzly’s visa did not allow 
	her to stay much longer in Bangladesh—otherwise, I would’ve surely made her 
	halal for me. She had to leave Bangladesh soon after the interview was 
	complete. Allah, please do not be angry with me. Retribution is coming to 
	her sooner than she might expect. I have already dispatched three Islamic 
	sleuths to New York to hunt her down and bring her back to me. As a 
	punishment for her utter depravity I shall surely treat her as a captive, 
	incarcerate her in a dingy chamber and make her halal for my lieutenants. 
	They will enjoy her by turn; day in and day out—just the way the Jihadists 
	enjoys the women ‘zindiq’ (freethinkers) prisoners in Iran, Sudan and 
	Nigeria. Allah, have a look at the Sunna of your Prophet: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i>Muhammad did not approve coitus interruption with 
		the captive women of Banu-al-Mustaliq, but he allowed their women to be 
		raped...5.59.459 </i></p>
		<p align="justify">Volume 5, Book 59, Number 459: Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: 
		I entered the Mosque and saw Abu Said Al-Khudri and sat beside him and 
		asked him about Al-Azl (i.e. coitus interruptus). Abu Said said, &quot;We 
		went out with Allah's Apostle for the Ghazwa of Banu Al-Mustaliq and we 
		received captives from among the Arab captives and we desired women and 
		celibacy became hard on us and we loved to do coitus interruptus. So 
		when we intended to do coitus interrupt us, we said, 'How can we do 
		coitus interruptus before asking Allah's Apostle who is present among 
		us?&quot; We asked (him) about it and he said, 'It is better for you not to

		Ali)?&quot; When we reached the Prophet I mentioned that to him. He said, &quot;O 
		Buraida! Do you hate Ali?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you hate him, for 
		he deserves more than that from the Khumlus.&quot; </p>

		we love property; what do you think about coitus interruptus?&quot; Allah's

	<p align="justify">Rabbul al-Amin, you will be extremely pleased that we 
	have lately formed the Rahmat Allah Battalion (RAB). Actually, most of the 
	members of this battalion are imported from Somalia Sudan and 
	Afghanistan—your dearest Islamic Paradises. This is the most closely guarded 
	secret in Bangladesh. Their commanders are Afghan Taliban Jihadists. In 
	reality, RAB is an assassin squad—exactly in the fashion of the killing 
	squads that your dearest Prophet formed to kill his critiques. We convinced 
	NPB (Nationalist Party of Bangladesh) to form RAB by citing the Sunna of our 
	Nabi Karim. RAB’s prime targets are the writers, singers, folk dancers, 
	artists, actors, academics, intellectuals, secular freethinkers, some 
	opposition leaders and the infidels. Allah, please have an intimate look at 
	the uniform and the head-gear of these soldiers of yours. Don’t you think 
	they look exactly like your soldiers in the Badr, Uhud, Hunayn and Khaybar…..? 
	Look at their pitch-black outer garment and their dark turban that is 
	tightly tied at the rear of their head. Rahman-ar-Rahim, in case you have 
	forgotten how you dressed your fighters 1400 years ago, please look at RAB. 
	It will surely remind you that before they went on killing missions, your 
	soldiers always wore black uniforms and tied their turbans in exactly the 
	same fashion as RAB. Allah, look at your current Iraqi commander, Musab al-Zarqawi. 
	Our RAB wears almost similar outfit like him. Most Bangladeshis are really a 
	bunch of dunces. They think the members of RAB are their own flesh and 
	blood. We simply laugh at their imbecility. We knew rather well that very 
	few ordinary Bengali soldiers or policemen will have the heart to shoot 
	their brethren for no good reason. That is why I cleverly advised our 
	current PM to import those heartless, cruel and blood-thirsty Islamic 
	Jihadists from some far distant Islamic Paradises. The beautiful reward from 
	the smartest Prime Minister in the world was that she carefully whispered to 
	the police to escort me to a safe haven, although, just to please the Great 
	Satan, she had previously issued an order for my arrest. Allah, don’t you 
	think I should have a good laugh when I reflect on the extraordinary talent 
	of this lady? See, how correct I am when I mentioned that the Bengali’s are 
	really asinine. I live amongst the very nose of the security people of 
	Bangladesh, yet they cannot even see or catch me! How wonderful! Allah, 
	isn’t this similar to Gabriel? When he visited Muhammad no one could see him 
	except Nabiji? Don’t you think I am just one rank below your dearest 
	Prophet? Allah, this is nothing but your Kudrat (blessing). Marhaba! Marhaba!
	</p>
	<p align="justify">Glorified Allah, would you believe how cleverly we have 
	formed two fronts of attack on the 99% ordinary, not-so-good, hypocrite 
	Muslims of Bangladesh? While RAB continues eliminating the intellectuals, 
	the upper class urban enemies of Islam, we have stealthily formed a cadre of 
	tens and thousands of nascent Jihadists entirely from the rural Madrassas of 
	Bangladesh. At dead of night we trained them in arms and explosive handling. 
	During day, they dutifully memorised the Qura’an. What a beautiful strategy, 
	come to think of it! I am certain you will be simply too happy that we 
	followed the exact footsteps of your most beloved creation (Muhammad). 
	Allah, do you recall that your best friend conducted military training at 
	his mosque and meted out your prescribed punishments, including beheadings 
	there? This is exactly what we plan to do in future. We will convert all 
	mosques in Bangladesh in to Islamic fortresses. From these ubiquitous abodes 
	of yours we shall deliver all judgments according to your law (Sharia). We 
	will establish a blood-bank in every mosque. These blood-banks will collect 
	the blood from those who will be beheaded or amputated right in front of the 
	cheering faithfuls. Every time we behead a ‘zindiq’ they will shout Allahu 
	Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar—three times—just to be precise with the 
	Islamic ritual of slaughter. You surely will be utterly pleased to witness 
	so much of blood—human blood. This is far better than sacrificing cows and 
	goats. We shall then export the blood thus collected. This will earn plenty 
	of foreign exchange for a desperately poor country like Bangladesh. The 
	flesh of those beheaded ‘zindiqs’ will be fed to the hungry wild dogs, the 
	foxes, the hyenas, the wolves, the lions, the tigers and the bears kept in 
	the zoos of Bangladesh. The leftover bones of these intellectuals of 
	Bangladesh will be used to manufacture fertilizer. See, Allah what a 
	beautiful plan we have for our beloved Islamic Paradise. For stoning to 
	death we shall recycle those stones that we had used for our toilet 
	purposes. How beautiful this Islamic recycling is! Nothing is wasted—not 
	even human flesh and bones! </p>
	<p align="justify">Ya Aziz, you may wonder why I am writing to you. You see, 
	as I mentioned at the outset of this epistle, we planned everything 
	meticulously. Following your command, we killed so many of those 
	intellectuals just to instil terror in the minds of the ordinary folks of 
	Bangladesh. Look Allah, what you wrote in your Qur’an Sharif: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i>Allah casts terror in the hearts of unbelievers; 
		they will reside in hell...3:151 </i></p>
		<p align="justify"><i>Strike terror in the hearts of the unbelievers; 
		smite the unbelievers at neck and cut off their fingers...8:12 </i></p>
		<p align="justify"><i>The unbelievers cannot escape Allah’s 
		terror...8:59 </i></p>
		<p align="justify"><i>True Jihadists (good Muslims) do not ask for 
		exemption from fighting with their persons and wealth (i.e., true 
		Muslims are terrorists)…9:44 </i></p>
		<p align="justify"><i>Allah stopped showing miracles because the 
		previous generations considered them as false; so Allah only sends signs 
		by way of terror...17:59 </i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify">Beloved Allah, I just quoted samples of those ‘terrific’ 
	verses. In case you have forgotten, please look carefully in your Qur’an and 
	you will find scores of such verses. The trouble is, most of these ‘Harami’ 
	(wicked) Bengalis do not accept our divine acts as your commandment to true 
	Jihadists. That is why we are now in trouble. Recently, while we were 
	earnestly conducting an operation to infuse terror in the hearts of a few 
	‘Harami’ villagers, a few of your soldiers were caught by the ‘Mushrekins’ 
	(hypocrite Muslims). With fuming anger and ‘Gono Pituni’ (mob lynching) the 
	villagers beat those soldiers of yours to death. We feel so frustrated, 
	fearing that you have abandoned us in the midst of this Jihad. Allah, please 
	help us now. Please send us the angels that you sent at Badr and Hunayn. We 
	implore you fervently that unless you send your divine intervention all of 
	us will soon become martyrs. But Allah, you see, almost all our cadre 
	consist of very young Madrassa-going teen-agers. They are unmarried, poor 
	and hungry. How could you make them martyrs so soon when they are yet to 
	taste the sweetness of their wives, take booty to be rich and have plenty of 
	delicious food to eat. After all, that was what you promised to all the 
	Jihadists. So, Allah, please do not disappoint us any more. Immediately send 
	us at least 5 000 angels (just like at Badr war). Kindly send us your sign 
	of intervention. Once I receive your unmistakable signal I shall, at once, 
	despatch my assassin squad to kill more ‘zindiqs’. This time your soldiers, 
	with the help of your angels, will kill, not by tens, but by hundreds and 
	thousands. You will be happy that eventually we shall be successful in 
	establishing an uncontaminated Taliban State in Bangladesh. Allah, don’t you 
	think that will be the best gift to you? You dearly love blood. We shall 
	offer you blood—plenty of it. Here is an ocean of blood for you—the blood of 
	the ‘Harami’ Bengalis. </p>
	<p align="justify">I remain steadfastly. </p>
