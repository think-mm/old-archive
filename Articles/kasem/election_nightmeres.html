		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Election fever is on again after 
		5 years of lull. One may recall that election in Bangladesh had never 
		bee a very pleasant affair. Blood has already been shed in the past few 
		days and much blood will be shed in the coming days. The foremost 
		question in peoples mind is to vote for which party? The majority of the 
		people will vote either <i><b>Awami league (AL)</b></i> or the <i><b>BNP-Islamist coalition</b></i>.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For the last few days, I thought 
		very deeply about consequences of BNP-Islamists led coalition coming to 
		power. The burning issue on my mind is the freedom of expression that we 
		enjoy today in writing and publishing in Internet newspaper like NFB or 
		in any print mainstream newspapers such as the Daily Star, The 
		Independent, The Bangladesh Observer, etc. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This glasnost or openness in 
		expression one's opinion has opened a Pandora's Box no doubt. There are 
		already threats by some quarters in BNP that NFB is crossing the limit 
		of freedom of expression and should be closed down. Those who talk in 
		this fashion are none other than the Islamic supporters of BNP. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They are simply frustrated at 
		the religious criticisms that are being published every now and then in 
		the popular Internet newspaper from Dhaka. These people forget one 
		simple truth and that is, the same cyber newspaper also publishes 
		freethinker-bashing articles almost on a daily basis. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img height="129" src="bshots.jpg" width="233" border="0"></p>
		<p align="justify">
		<img src="http://www.bangladeshobserveronline.com/new/2003/10/02/pag4.jpg"></p>
		<p align="center"><img height="194" src="131102.jpg" width="324"></p>
		<p align="center"><i><b><font face="Verdana">Picture: BNP-Islamist 
		coalition</font></b></i></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The freethinkers have never 
		objected to the publication of any of these freethinker-bashing articles 
		and have never ever want that the news forum should be closed down.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Have you ever thought if this 
		kind of free expression would have been possible if BNP-Islamist were in 
		power? To my mind it is almost an impossibility. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, this coming election 
		result will determine if the Bangladeshis will continue to enjoy this 
		unprecedented free-expression or will be gagged if they tried to speak 
		against any matter that one section of the population (especially the 
		religionists) may object. We must remember that BNP cannot form a viable 
		Government alone without some supports from the Islamists. And why 
		should the Islamists support BNP if they do not get what they want? So, 
		BNP have to negotiate a deal with its three partners. It is just a 
		matter of time when we will see that Islamic partners will push BNP to 
		agree an Islamic agenda. And that is for sure. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I thought on this issue, I 
		suddenly went back in 1971 and those days of the religionists (Razakars 
		and Al Badars .Pakistani/Bangladeshi Islamists) and I reminisced those 
		nightmarish days and nights that I (rather we) experienced personally. I 
		still shudder whenever I think of those days. Are we going back to those 
		dark and ominous days again? Here are some of my personal thoughts on 
		events that may take place in Bangladesh if BNP-Islamist coalition wins 
		the election. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All the imaginary events that I 
		am describing below are based on my personal experience when Bangladesh 
		was in the hands of the Razakars and the Islamic soldiers of Pakistan. 
		For those who were not born at that time or were too young to remember 
		those dark days and nights, these examples will be almost impossible to 
		imagine, Those who experienced those days but pretend that nothing 
		happened or those who have selective amnesia are simply deluding 
		themselves. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>These are my election nightmares:</b>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The BNP-Islamists will agree to 
		implement Sharia laws in Bangladesh. The Constitution of Bangladesh will 
		be changed to make Qur'an and Hadith as the only source of laws in 
		Bangladesh. Hudud laws will also be enforced in due course. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The popular NFB will be taken 
		over by the Islamists. Mr Tanveer Chowdhury will be tried in Sharia 
		court for sheltering the atheists, freethinkers, infidels and 
		blasphemers. He will plead that he sheltered the Islamists too. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, his plea will simply be 
		ignored. He will be found guilty of blasphemy and beheaded in the 
		compound of Baitul Mukarram mosque in Dhaka in presence of crowds 
		chanting Allahu Akbar and Naraye Takbir, Allahu Akbar, etc. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Islamists will turn NFB in 
		to a Sharia site. Only Qur'an, Ahadith and Islamic writings of such 
		personalities as Maulana Moudoodi will be published endlessly. The 
		current readership of 10,000 to 15 000 per day will dwindle to around 
		10-15 per day. Those Islamists who write in NFB will be the only 
		readers. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jaffor Ullah will probably be 
		kidnapped from America gagged and put into a jet plane by the Jihadis 
		and flown to ZIA International Airport in Dhaka. Like Tanvir Chowdhury, 
		he will be tortured and shot. His dead body will be displayed openly 
		near the Gulistan junction (where Mirjumla's Kaman is located). </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If the Jihadis fail to kidnap 
		Jaffor Ullah then they will gun him down at his doorsteps in America by 
		the hired assassin. The FBI and the U.S Government will have the 
		slightest clue in tracing the killers of the editorial board member of 
		NFB. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jamal Hasan will face a similar 
		fate. He will probably be lured by an Islamic Chameleon to have a 
		dialogue with a friend. He will never return home. His wife and kid will 
		frantically search for him without any success. The U.S. guards will 
		eventually find his decomposed dead body in a disused mining pool 
		somewhere in U.S with bullet marks and signs of torture on his person 
		(just like back in 1971 people used to find dead bodies in many swampy 
		and uninhabited areas). </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A death squad will be despatched 
		to several Western countries to track down and finish off with Fatemolla, 
		Abul Kasem, Syed Kamran Mirza, Satya Sandhani, Shabnam Nadiya, Khurshid 
		Chowdhury, Narayan Gupta, Avijit Roy, Taslima Nasrin, Shabbir Ahmed, 
		Habib Sarwar, Aparthib Zaman, Akash Jahed.....The death squad will be 
		successful in some cases and will fail in other cases. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Who will survive is difficult to 
		guess. It is certain that Shabnam will be raped before being killed. 
		(This was how it used to be done back in 1971. A death squad used to be 
		sent to the family whom the Razakars had targeted for elimination)
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The remainder of the Mujib 
		family (like Sheikh Hasina, Sheikh Rehana, their spouses and their 
		children) will be finished. The name Mujib and Bangabandhu will be 
		eliminated from the soil of Bangladesh. Any one with the name 'Mujib' 
		have to change his/her name to a more appropriate Islamic name much the 
		way that most Muslims do not want the name 'Israel'. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">General Ziaur Rahman will be 
		declared the &quot;Abbun Bangladeshis&quot; father of Bangladesh, and Khaleda Zia 
		will be the &quot;Ummun Bangladeshis&quot; mother of the Nation. Sheikh Mujib's 
		portrait displayed in public places will be removed and replaced with 
		the portrait of a smiling Gen. Zia some in military attire and other 
		with civilian western attire. The thin moustache of the great general 
		will be razor sharp and the leader will sport a youthful vigor with a 
		permanent smile on his face. Bangladesh's Ammajan will also look very 
		sharp in the portrait a la Babita hairstyle. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, right in front of Zia 
		International airport, Mrs. Khaleda Zia's larger than life portrait may 
		sport a Hijab to impress the visiting Sheiks of United Arab Emirate or 
		Saudi Arabia's King. The onetime despot Ershad will be the Brother and 
		Begum Rowshan Ershad will be the Sister of the nation. Golam Azam will 
		be brought back to politics; his title will be the Grand Mufti of 
		Bangladesh. Maulana Saikul Hadis will be the grand father of Bangladesh. 
		All of these may sound hilarious but make no mistake about it that it 
		may happen if BNP and her allies win this coming election. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All communists, socialists, 
		freethinkers and secularists will be hunted down and slaughtered in 
		Indonesian style. In Indonesia, about 1 million communists were killed. 
		The number of such people killed in Bangladesh will be 3 million. Before 
		killing these kafirs and enemies of Islam, their blood will be siphoned 
		off just like the way it used to be done by the Razakars in those 
		good-old-Islamic days of 1971. This blood will then be exported to earn 
		foreign exchange so that General Zia's Mazar in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar can 
		have a real gold dome. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In due course the time clock in 
		Bangladesh will revert back to 1971. All Razakars, Al Badars, Al Shams 
		will be resurrected. Ashrafuzzaman Khan who never returned to his 
		homeland after December 16, 1971, will be brought back to Dhaka with an 
		honor guard at the tarmac of ZIA International airport. Golam Azam 
		himself will be there with his entire Shura member to greet 
		Ashrafuzzaman at the airport. Along with him will come all the 
		distinguished member of CARE, ICNA, ISNA, and NABIC's office bearers. 
		All the Razakars who went hiding will be asked to come out of their 
		hideout. This time they will be issued with M-16 and/or AK-47 rifles and 
		plenty of plastic bombs. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Each Razakar will be assigned to 
		survey and monitor about 5 families. They will dictate every aspect of 
		family lives especially on religious matters. For example, if the adult 
		members of a family do not pray five times a day, then they will be 
		ordered to pray. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If they refuse to follow that 
		order, then they will be shot dead on the spot. Remember, when the Arab 
		invaders conquered Persia, they did exactly this. One Arab was assigned 
		to each family to control the livelihood of the Persians. That was how 
		the Arabic script replaced the original Persian script. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many Bangalee Military and 
		Police personnel will refuse to kill their own flesh and blood. These 
		security people will be gunned down immediately for refusing to follow 
		Islamic orders. To replace these renegade people, Islamic soldiers and 
		Jihadis will be imported from the Islamic brotherhood countries of 
		Taliban land (Afghanistan), Pakistan, and possibly from Sudan, and 
		Nigeria as well. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In total, about half a million 
		of these Islamic brothers will be involved in the search and destroy 
		operation. As added rewards for their pious duty each of these foreign 
		Islamic brother soldiers will be awarded at least two Bangalee women as 
		captives/and or booties. These women will be the mothers, sisters or the 
		wives of the murdered communists, socialists and free thinkers. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They will devour our women like 
		a starved wolf eats its prey (we saw this happening in 1971). These 
		Islamic soldiers will be handed over the land and properties of the 
		slain communists and free thinkers. Thus, they will have a great and 
		enjoyable life in Bangladesh. Many of these foreign Islamists will 
		become the adviser to the BNP-Islamist coalition Government and will 
		control every thing. Eventually Bangladesh will be become Pakistan 
		again. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our national anthem will be 
		replaced by one imported from Karachi, the seat of Urdu culture in 
		Pakistan. Of course, Dhaka's Islamic Foundation with the help of Dhaka's 
		poet &quot;philosopher&quot; Farhad Mazhar will modify it. Also, dHAKA-fame 
		eminent rock artist Mac (Maqsood) will be requested to set tune to the 
		Urdu-Bongo lyric in the fashion of Bollywood-Bangla-Bhangra fusion 
		music, which is his forte these days. To purify the adulterated new 
		culture of Bangladesh all works of Rabindranath Tagore and other Hindu 
		writers, all works of Humayun Ahmed and other secularists as well as 
		some selected writings of Kazi Nazrul Islam will be completely banned.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Any one found with any writings 
		of these writers will face a minimum of 100 lashes. All citizens will be 
		issued with the Islamic books written by Abul Ala Moudoodi and Golam 
		Azam. A condensed version of their writings will be printed in 
		pocket-sized format (like the red book of Mao); however it be bound by 
		green colored synthetic rubber to make it waterproof and to save the 
		book from torrential monsoon deluge. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Every person must always carry 
		this little green book in a way that one carries his driving licence and 
		credit cards. This pocket size green book will contain the solution of 
		all problems because it will be based on Qur'an and hadith. After all, 
		Islam is a complete code of life. It has the solution for all human 
		problems. Arabic will also become a compulsory language. Bangla scripts 
		will be gradually replaced by Arabic or Persian alphabet. The use of 
		Bangla alphabets will be severely discouraged since these are not the 
		alphabets of Islam. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Folks, wait and you will see 
		that Bangladesh will be declared an Islamic country where only the 
		Sharia laws will be implemented. This dear motherland of ours will be an 
		extension of Taliban ruled Afghanistan and the dictator ruled Pakistan. 
		The fundamental human rights will be abolished. Our dear budding 
		democracy will be killed in its infancy. The Universal declaration of 
		human rights will be replaced by the Islamic human rights. After 
		finishing off with the free thinkers, the BNP-led coalition will 
		introduce Islamic freethinking a concept propounded in NFB by a 
		pedagogue from Upper Volta University. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similar to other revolutionary 
		Islamic country, Islamic democracy will be established in Bangladesh. 
		The supreme head will be the Amir'ul Mumenin. The first Ami'rul Mumenin 
		will be Golam Azam. His words will be laws similar in ways of what we 
		find in Taliban land where the words of Mullah Omar are the laws. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is most likely that BNP will 
		agree to the imposition of blasphemy law in the same manner as in 
		Pakistan. BNP-Islamist coalition may also agree to the imposition of 
		mobile prison (Burqa) for our mothers, sisters and wives. It is very 
		likely that the mother of the nation, Umm Khaleda Zia must be in mobile 
		prison whenever she ventures out. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similar to Pakistan, there will 
		be hardly any minority left in Bangladesh. The current Hindu population 
		of around 10% (this used to be around 30 % before 1971) will quickly go 
		down to around 0.5% to 1%. Only a few thousand of Christians and 
		Buddhists will be in Bangladesh. All non-Muslims will be forced to wear 
		yellow star to identify themselves as non-Muslims (just like in Taliban 
		land). They (the minorities) will also be required to pay the infamous 
		Zijiya tax. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All the Budhhist statutes at 
		Mainamati (in Comilla district) and Mahastan (in Bogra district) will be 
		destroyed. BNP will first object to this destruction of our priceless 
		heritage but will finally surrender to the Islamists' demand due to the 
		pressure from the Arab Masters. Any one found with anything with the 
		slightest resemblance of a statute shall face death penalty. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In cultural arena, all zari, 
		sari, bhatiyali, murshidi, baul songs, polli giti, etc., will be banned. 
		These will be replaced with hamd, nat-i-rasul, and qauwali. Only modern 
		song you'll ever hear will be our new national anthem (Farhad Mazahr-Mac's 
		creation). Likewise, Dhaka University's Fine Arts building will be 
		closed forever and the building will be fumigated first and then 
		modernized to house Islamic arts and crafts such as display of decorated 
		swords, and rehels (for holding Qur'an above the feet level). Another 
		section will sport a display of fine Hizab, Nequab, Burqua, Chaddar, 
		etc. Shapely young girls will act as model to popularize Islamic female 
		dresses. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In another section of the 
		building, the fine arts of applying henna dye to color hand and feet and 
		yes coloring hair will be demonstrated too. Nearby, in another room a 
		barber will show to young man how to sport a chap dari a la Saudi style, 
		which is now very much in vogue in Hollywood movies. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All Bangalee intellectuals and 
		professionals like authors, poets, novelists, painters, newspaper 
		editors, architects, movie makers, engineers, scientists, doctors, 
		academics, teachers will be systematically and methodically eliminated 
		in Nazi style Gestapo and gas chambers. In this way, the unfinished job 
		of 1971 will be completed. This is sure way of transforming the Bangalee 
		society into a nation of beggars, fools, subservient and slaves of 
		Pakistani Islam. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Selective breeding will take 
		place between the true Pakistani Islamists and the half- Islamist 
		Bangalee women. This original plan of a few Pakistani Generals could not 
		be implemented in 1971 due to the rapid advance of our valiant Mukti 
		Bahini and the allied forces. This time however it will be a success.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, BNP-Islamist coalition 
		will welcome such innovative breeding idea or eugenics. Pakistani 
		soldiers, Afghan Pathans will have temporary marriages (mut'ah marriage) 
		with our selected women to breed a new race who will be true Islamists. 
		Eventually the whole Bengali race will change. This was the ultimate aim 
		of Major General Rao Farman Ali and General A.A.K. Niazi back in 1971. 
		This was how they wanted to make the then East Pakistan a true Islamic 
		State. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I know what you are thinking 
		after going through my dismal write-up. You are thinking that those 
		incidents can never happen in Bangladesh. Those are my wishful thinking. 
		Well, that is why this essay is named 'Election Nightmares'. But think 
		again. Those nightmarish events have every possibility of being 
		implemented in Bangladesh if the BNP-Islamist coalition wins this 
		important election and rises to power. My wishful/absurd thoughts are 
		all based on the tumultuous events of 1971. I earnestly hope that my 
		'election nightmares' remain just a nightmare and never become a 
		reality. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How can we forget the events of 
		1971 and all the blood that our brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers and 
		dear ones have shed for the Bangladesh that we cherish so much? The 
		freedom of expression that we take for granted today was achieved 
		through rivers of blood, sweat and tears. How can we let this priceless 
		gift of freedom slip away from us? Do not betray your blood. Please vote 
		carefully. </font></p>
