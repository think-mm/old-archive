		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dear Friends,&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Perhaps all of 
		us in this list remember the Netrokona suicide bombing in December 2005. 
		Such news disappears from the media and our memory too soon. A man on a 
		bicycle had carried a bomb to a crowd, killing and wounding many. 
		Perhaps none of us knew directly any of the victims. Only abstractly, we 
		knew that the people affected were real, that somewhere there was a 
		mother, a father, a brother, a sister.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No, it is not 
		that we must have a direct relationship with the victims to care about a 
		crime.&nbsp; Indeed, what sort of world would it be if we care about 
		injustice and oppression only when we are affected personally?&nbsp; And yet, 
		we know too that such considerations need a connection to people to 
		become real and true. Our concern and our condolences must be a hand in 
		support, an embrace, words heard by the aggrieved; and to understand the 
		news, to be with people, we need to see faces behind the reports. Thus - 
		a visit in January that I speak of below, if there are some who find it 
		of interest.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Netrokona, the 
		town I went to, is in the north east region of Bangladesh.&nbsp; You can go 
		there by car in about three and half hours from the capital.&nbsp; The road 
		is a strip of grey on a green landscape of cultivated fields spread all 
		the way to the horizon.&nbsp; In winter mornings a thick fog comes to hide 
		all that is a stones throw away.&nbsp; An overloaded truck, a packed bus, a 
		lone rickshaw – materialize out of absolutely nothing.&nbsp; In the summer 
		the rainfall in this region is among the heaviest in Bangladesh.&nbsp; All 
		these can make the journey a little difficult even in the best of times.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Once you are 
		there, after the road trip, it is peaceful and very quiet, as if on a 
		remote island. The town is about 50 thousand people. Small bungalow 
		homes lie in rows by the narrow streets.&nbsp; A short walk in any direction 
		gives way to the open fields of the countryside. It is very peaceful and 
		life has a certain simplicity. It is a gentler sort of life.&nbsp; Strangers 
		trust each other, the language is softer and, there is much hospitality 
		and kindness.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not a 
		backwater by any means.&nbsp; This area was a site of much activity during 
		the resistance against British rule in India.&nbsp; The Tebagha movement 
		happened here.&nbsp; A major three day All India Peasant Conference was held 
		here in 1945.&nbsp; Today many progressive groups like Bangladesh Nari 
		Progoti Songstha and Udichi are active here.&nbsp; Perhaps as much as 30% of 
		the population is non-muslim.&nbsp; With this diversity and history of 
		progressive culture it is not a mystery that this town became the target 
		of religious extremists.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In my visit I 
		met many people, victims of that infamous attack, families.&nbsp; Today I 
		want to speak of Shudipta Rani Paul. “Shelly” as she was known to her 
		friends, lived with her parents in a one room bungalow.&nbsp; On this morning 
		that I was there, the sun streamed in from a window though the branches 
		of a tree and the floor shone bright.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a small home but pretty, 
		clean, colorful, spare. The family belongings gathered in one room 
		underline the simplicity of their life: two beds, a bookshelf, a glass 
		almirah in which are framed a few pictures of Shudipta.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shudipta was a 
		beautiful vivacious young woman.&nbsp; In the pictures you see her youthful, 
		amongst friends, with family,&nbsp; in&nbsp; plays performed on stage, in a 
		once-in-a-lifetime trip to Kerala. She had had many friends.&nbsp; No doubt 
		her friends were gladdened by someone who rose above the plainness of 
		her surroundings in such enthusiasm for the arts, for her activism with 
		the women of the town, for her singing and indeed - for&nbsp; life.&nbsp; Plays 
		were her passion and Udichi was a good organization for her.&nbsp; Udichi is 
		one of the oldest cultural organizations in the country, mass based in 
		its music, drama, dance, fine arts and literature.&nbsp; The majority of its 
		performances are street plays.&nbsp; One - <i>Itihas Katha Kao</i> (“Speak, 
		History!”) has been performed over 1,050 times. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On this 
		morning, Shudipta’s mother entered the room. Grief was fresh on her 
		face. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">She was 
		sobbing. “The boy did not want to be left there.&nbsp; He cried and cried 
		begging me to not leave him there.” </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This boy she 
		was crying for is Shudipta’s younger brother.&nbsp; He is there in a picture, 
		perhaps late teens, handsome, a smile on his face.&nbsp; He had been 
		suffering from mental illness.&nbsp; In the non-existent mental health system 
		in Bangladesh, the only option after a point is to leave him in the one 
		“mental asylum” in the country that is little more than a prison. So 
		infamous is this institution that it is not known by its own name but by 
		the name of the town it is situated in, at another end of the country, 
		and that name is used in insults. So that is what had happened, after 
		Shudipta’s death, just before this bright morning of my visit.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shudipta’s 
		father is a slim, pepper haired man of perhaps little more than sixty.&nbsp; 
		A retired schoolteacher, frailer than his age,&nbsp; he recently developed 
		serious health problems. But on this day he could only speak of his 
		daughter:&nbsp; she was the only earning member of the family and she it was 
		who had cared for the entire family.&nbsp; All her small earnings from the 
		women’s&nbsp; NGO that she worked in went to support the family -&nbsp;&nbsp; mother, 
		father, brother. She used to love her work, her plays.&nbsp; She was born in 
		this one roomed house we were in today, and here it was that she had 
		grown up.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The room 
		didn’t have many things, but it had sunshine. Once this sunshine had 
		warmth, children’s laughter, happiness.&nbsp; Here a little baby girl was 
		born, spoke her first words, played with her dolls, did her school work, 
		grew up and cared for sick parents.&nbsp; And here, in this room, is one of 
		the oldest stories of humankind, a story repeated endlessly through the 
		ages and never the lesser, a story that has been told by others in far 
		better ways than I can, this tragedy unlike any for a mother and a 
		father: the child dies. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now - a 
		thousand memories in each corner of their home, overlapping one other as 
		the layers of a ruined city, each one evoking that which is no longer, 
		each calling a name that is no longer even a name.&nbsp; Now – the emptiness 
		of it!&nbsp; And yet, fate does not leave them alone. This home, where they 
		had lived so long, where their children were born, so heavy with 
		memories, tragic and familiar, this too may not be theirs anymore.&nbsp; The 
		landlord on whose land they rented this room, he is selling the land, 
		and the future for Shudipta’s parents is uncertain.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This morning, 
		in the Udichi bungalow nearby, the same one which was the target of the 
		bombs and where Shudipta suffered her fatal wounds – for she had not 
		died instantly, but lingered on with her broken body for almost a day – 
		people gathered to mark the 30 day passage of the atrocity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The room 
		was full of men and women.&nbsp; It was a subdued atmosphere, sorrowful.&nbsp; 
		People wept quietly.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was not much talk of bringing the 
		perpetrators to justice.&nbsp; Perhaps people despair of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The killer 
		destroyed himself.&nbsp; Alive are the real perpetrators of the crime, 
		anonymous and arrogant, the tentacles of their power assiduously 
		cultivated over decades today mixed in with the life blood of the 
		country, in the schools, in the police barracks, in the fashionable 
		homes of the power brokers of the elite.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But powerful 
		though they may be, these evil ones do not have the hearts of the people 
		of the land. Ordinary people, those who do not seek to be bribed by 
		power or money, they see today’s fascists for what they are. People 
		remember, too, those other atrocities that were perpetrated by the same 
		criminals at the very birth of Bangladesh. They can win if they consider 
		murder a victory, but they can not convince us, can not win us over, for 
		to do that they would have to have tolerance, reason and humanity on 
		their side, which is precisely what they lack. So long there are people 
		who oppose them and extend sympathy and help to our traumatized 
		communities, those enemies of the people have not won, for each of their 
		crime shout aloud their sub humanity.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For Shudipta 
		and all the other martyred activists of Udichi, may we pay homage with a 
		few lines from Neruda?<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
