	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On August 6 and 9 1945 the US

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;...the entry of the Soviet Union 
	into the war (against Japan) was the decisive factor that hastened the end

	the same.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(New York Times Aug 15 1945.) </font>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Or Roosevelt, who had realised as 
	early as 1943 that: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;With Russia as an ally in the war

	didn't we try it out under the auspices of the allied powers, to show its 
	tremendous effectiveness, and on that basis, send an ultimatum to Japan, and 
	throw the responsibility on to the Japanese themselves? Whatever the answer 
	to that question, if the aim of the atomic bomb lay in the fact that we had 
	to beat Japan before the Soviet Union could take part in the war (with 
	Japan), no experiment could take place.&quot; </font></p>

	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;There was never, from about two 
	weeks from the time I took charge, any illusions on my part, but that Russia 
	was our enemy, and that the project was carried out on that basis. I didn't 
	go along with attitude of the whole country that Russia was our gallant

	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We conclude that the dropping of

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Or even Churchill: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It would be a mistake to suppose

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Winston Churchill &quot;The Second World 
	War.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Churchill was one of those in on the 
	beginning of the atomic bomb plans. And at the time he helped to propagate 
	the myth: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It is to this atomic bomb more than 
	to any other factor that we may ascribe the sudden and speedy ending of the 
	war against Japan.&quot; </font></p>

	Commons, Aug 17 1945.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Or US Secretary for War Henry 
	Stimson, who wrote in his diary that the atomic bomb was: &quot;to persuade 
	Russia to play ball&quot; and: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The necessity of bringing Russian 
	orgn. into the fold of Christian civilisation... The possible use of S1 [the

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(From US Secretary for War Henry

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Russian entry will have a profound

	Stimson.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Or Eisenhower; when told by US 
	Secretary for War Henry Stimson that nuclear weapons were to be used on 
	Japan: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I voiced to him my grave 
	misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated 
	and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary... Japan was at that 
	very moment seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of face.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Dwight D. Eisenhower.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And later: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It wasn't necessary to hit them 
	with that awful thing.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Eisenhower.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Allied powers had agreed at 
	Yalta that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan on land in 
	Manchuria three months after the Germans were defeated in Europe. This was 
	to give the USSR time to move the Red Army half way around the world. The 
	German surrender was on May 8 1945, so the date for the Soviet attack was to 
	be August 8 1945, which they kept exactly to the day. Churchill called this:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;...another example of the fidelity 
	and punctuality with which Marshal Stalin and his valiant armies always kept 
	their military engagements.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Winston Churchill, House of 
	Commons.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the US wanted Japan to 
	capitulate to US occupying forces rather than Soviet. There was no time to 
	test the atomic bomb elsewhere, even though Kure, a military target, was 
	only 20 miles away, but was already damaged by conventional bombing and 
	therefore would not be suitable for an &quot;experiment.&quot; So Hiroshima, an 
	undamaged target full of innocent civilian guinea pigs, was chosen for the 
	&quot;experiment&quot; on August 6 1945. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It seems clear that, even without 
	the atom bomb attacks, air supremacy over japan could have exerted 
	sufficient pressure to bring unconditional surrender and obviate the need 
	for invasion... Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and 
	supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is 
	the survey's opinion that certainly prior to December 31, 1945 Japan would 
	have surrendered even if the atom bomb had not been dropped, even if Russia 
	had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or 
	contemplated.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(US Strategic Bombing Survey 4, The 
	Summary Report on the Pacific War.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;There was not enough time between 
	16 July when we knew at New Mexico that the bomb would work, and 8 August, 
	the Russian deadline date, for us to have set up the very complicated 
	machinery of a test atomic bombing involving time-consuming problems of area 
	preparations, etc... No, any test would have been impossible if the purpose 
	was to knock Japan out before Russia came in - or at least before Russia 
	could make anything other than a token of participation prior to a Japanese 
	collapse.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Thomas K. Finletter, Chairman of US 
	Air Policy Committee.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The Americans had no bombs to 
	waste. Apart from the static apparatus... There were just two bearing the 
	names &quot;The Thin Man&quot; and &quot;The Fat Man&quot;.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(US historian W. Manchester, in &quot;The 
	Glory and the Dream.&quot;) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No bombs to waste; the &quot;Fat Man&quot; and 
	the &quot;Thin Man&quot; had to be tested on live people and the Soviets had to be 
	kept in their place. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Japan was already effectively 
	defeated and had already offered to surrender. The Japanese had asked the 
	Soviet Union to mediate in surrender terms and peace negotiations as early 
	as March 1945. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It had been decided to use the atom 
	bomb on Japan as early as the beginning of July 1945; and Japan's offer of 
	surrender on July 22 1945 was therefore rejected. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;...the decision to use the atomic 
	weapon against Japan was taken at the beginning of July, 1945. The first 
	atomic bomb was dropped on August 6 and the offer of peace made by Japan on 
	July 22 was not accepted till August 10.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Attlee, in News Chronicle, Dec 5 
	1946.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The US were again informed on July 
	28 at Potsdam, before the bomb was used, that Japan was prepared to 
	surrender: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Stalin:&quot;I want to inform you that 
	we, the Russian delegation, have received a new proposal from Japan... 
	[Japan's note on mediation was then read out in English B.M.] ... Japan is 
	offering to cooperate with us. We intend to reply to them in the same spirit 
	as last time.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Truman:&quot;We do not object.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Attlee:&quot;We agree.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(At Potsdam Conference, July 28 
	1945) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Japanese also helped propagate 
	the myth that the bomb forced them to surrender by omitting to announce 
	their surrender offers to the Soviets: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Already the governing classes, 
	headed by the Emperor, are desperately trying to 'save their face' by 
	ascribing defeat to the atomic bomb, conveniently forgetting their request 
	to Russia to mediate with the Allies before the atomic bomb was used...
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The assertion that the new American 
	bombs brought the Japanese war to an end is a myth. As we know, weeks before 
	the appearance of the atom bombs, the Emperor Hirohito had already asked 
	Stalin to mediate; thus openly admitting defeat. In reality Japan had been 
	brought down by the interruption of her sea communications by Anglo-American 
	sea power and th edanger of a Soviet thrust across manchuria cutting off the 
	Japanese armies in Asia from home.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(The Times Aug 16 1945.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The entry into the war of the 
	Soviet Union this morning puts us in an utterly hopeless situation and makes

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why the rush to use the bomb?:

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(US Secretary of State James

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Churchill knew about the US atom 
	bomb plans. But they were kept secret from the USSR. When it was decided 
	eventually to tell Stalin Churchill showed nothing but deceitfulness and 
	contempt for a loyal ally: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Still, he had been a magnificent

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I am in entire agreement with the

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The last thing the US wanted was for 
	Japan to capitulate to the USSR. The US also did not want the Japanese 
	people to have the opportunity to opt for socialism: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Anxious as we were to have Russia 
	in the war against Japan, the experience at Potsdam now made me determined 
	that I would not allow the Russians any part in the control of Japan... 
	force is the only thing that the Russians understand.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(US President Truman, in his diary, 
	July 1945.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It is quite clear that the US do 
	not at the present time desire Russian participation in the war against 
	Japan.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Churchill, to Eden.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;[It is] now no longer necessary for 
	the Russians to come into the Japanese war; the new explosive alone was 
	sufficient to settle the matter. Furthermore, we now had something in our 
	hands which would redress the balance with the Russians... [Churchill could 
	now say to the USSR B.M.:] If you insist on doing this or that, well... [the 
	&quot;well&quot; and a pause meant an atom bomb B.M.] And then where are the 
	Russians!&quot; </font></p>

	war Field Marshal Lord Alan Brooke, talking about Churchill, in his war 
	diaries.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We should not need the Russians. 
	The end of the Japanese war no longer depended on the pouring in of their 
	armies... We had no need to ask favours of them... I minuted to Mr. Eden: 
	'It is quite clear that the United States do not at the present time desire 
	Russian participation in the war against Japan'.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Winston Churchill, in &quot;The Second 
	World War.&quot;) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This fear of Japan becoming 
	socialist is even more apparent when you consider that Japan's and Germany's 
	war debts and reparations were not only waived but millions of dollars of US 
	capital as &quot;Marshall Aid&quot; was pumped into these countries, as well as 
	Britain and the rest of Western Europe. This also helped to prevent the 
	possibility that these nations might have &quot;gone communist&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;If the bomb was dropped in a 
	desperate hurry on August 6, it must have been because Truman was determined 
	to drop it before the Russians had entered the war... But that was not all: 
	the bomb, as is so clearly suggested by Truman, Byrnes, Stimson and others, 
	was dropped very largely in order to impress Russia with America's great 
	might. Ending the war in Japan was incidental (the end of this war was 
	clearly in sight anyway), but stopping the Russians in Asia and checking 
	them in Eastern Europe was fundamental.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(British historian Alexander Werth 
	&quot;Russia At War.&quot;) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The bomb might well put us in a 
	position to dictate our own terms at the end of the war.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(US Secretary of State James 
	Byrnes.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The human cost of the US trying to 
	obtain a political position where it could dictate its own terms was right 
	from the start played down and hidden from view by the US; while subjecting 
	the human and physical remnants and survivors of the bomb to tests to assess 
	the effects of nuclear bombing. Medical tests were conducted by the US not 
	for the benefit of the Japanese victims, but purely for US military 
	experiments. Let no one be fooled by attempts to play down the effects of 
	nuclear bombing, such as radiation effects, which last for generations.

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I am an atomic bomb survivor 
	(Hibakusha) from Hiroshima. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On August 6, 1945, forty-two years 
	ago, an A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima by the USA. The bomb, containing 
	only 1 Kilogram of uranium but equal in power to 13,000 tons of TNT, fell on 
	Hiroshima with a bomb blast faster than sound and with heat rays exceeding 
	2,000 degrees centigrade on the ground within a radius of 600 meters. In an 
	instant it blew down buildings, houses and people in Hiroshima, destroying 
	everything... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the ground, numberless people had 
	fallen, groaning or crying for water, without anyone to help them. The 
	neighbourhood was so full of agonising cries, it was hell on earth. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That same day, some 9,000 
	12-year-old schoolboys were also engaged in work in the city, under the 
	national mobilisation law. In the instant of the A-bomb explosion, most of 
	them were charred to death. Those who narrowly escaped being killed were 
	left naked, their clothes burnt off. With their blistering skin peeling, 
	they tottered about in the sea of fire, and plunged into the river. When 
	they looked up from the water, they had already lost their sight. Embracing 
	each other by the shoulder, red and stripped of skin, they were washed away 
	toward the sea, crying &quot;Mama, help!&quot; The bodies washed toward the sea on the 
	seven rivers running through the city, turning the river surface dark, have 
	never been recovered. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even if the cry, &quot;Mama, help!&quot; had 
	reached their mothers, who could have helped them in that &quot;hell&quot;? The hell, 
	in which you could not save even your own children, that is A-bombing.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">People who survived the bombing, and 
	those who entered the city to search for relatives or help victims were 
	struck down by radiation and died after losing their hair and bleeding.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Three days later, on August 9, 
	another A-bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. The two A-bombs completely destroyed 
	the two cities, massacring the people without discrimination... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A-bombings allow us neither to live 
	nor die as human beings. A-bombs are... basically intended for total 
	destruction... which we human beings must never allow to exist. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the end of World War II, the 
	US occupational forces and the Japanese government tried to conceal the real 
	condition of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public by suppressing all 
	reports on the damage of these two cities caused by the A-bombs. This caused 
	delay in relief work for victims and prevented the effects of nuclear war 
	from being known to the world as well as formation of international opinion 
	for the banning of nuclear weapons... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We do not want anyone to ever again 
	go through the pain of nuclear war which we were made to suffer. &quot;Never make 
	hibakusha again&quot; - this is our hibakusha's heart-felt desire. This is our 
	wish to which we are determined to devote our lives. For that purpose, we

	the bombing have made 12 volumes collected by the women's peace committee of 
	the Buddhist organisation Soka Gakkai. One of the stories is of Mayumi 
	Yoshida; the long extract shows many aspects of life and what conditions and 
	government attitudes in the West are likely to be after a nuclear bombing:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I have written this for the sake of 
	my older sister, Yuriko, who has suffered a fate more cruel than death. I 
	have written in the hope that no other children like Yuriko are born into 
	this world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yuriko is one of twenty-two cases of 
	severe microcephaly caused in foetuses whose mothers were exposed at close 
	range to radiation from the atomic bomb. She limps because both pelvic 
	joints are dislocated. She has a speech disorder. Her body is the size of a 
	middle-school pupil, though she is thirty-six. Her mental abilities are 
	arrested at the level of a two-year-old... She is incapable of taking a 
	bath, going to the toilet, or doing anything else unassisted. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yuriko smiles when she is happy and 
	pouts when she is displeased... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Television movies are her greatest 
	joy... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why has she been condemned to such a 
	condition? Life is given equally to all. Who was it that twisted and 
	deformed my sister's life this way? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the day of the bombing, Mother 
	was happily anticipating Yuriko's birth. But, then, in a flash of fiendish 
	light, the bomb invaded even the sanctity of the womb and led a mother, an 
	unborn daughter, a whole family down a long path of suffering... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mother... had her baby boy, Masaaki, 
	strapped to her back... she was temporary blinded by a sudden flash of 
	light... the buildings and the fifty workers who had been there just seconds 
	earlier had vanished. Mother saw an immense fire... Before long a drizzle of 
	black rain began falling... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mother took Masaaki down from her 
	back, only to find that virtually countless slivers of glass were buried in 
	his bloody head... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mother fell ill a few weeks later...
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No one knew of atomic-radiation 
	sickness... On August 29 Masaaki died, but his name is not listed among the 
	atomic bomb victims since the cause of death was reported as gastric 
	obstruction... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The child growing in her womb was 
	some consolation for Masaaki's death. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was five or six years before her 
	death that Mother began complaining of pains... This was the beginning of 
	her struggle with the monster known as atomic-radiation sickness... </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One day, when Yuriko was sitting 
	next to her watching television, Mother stretched out her thin arm and took 
	her by the hand. Laying it on her side, she said, &quot;Yuriko, it hurts here. 
	Rub my side for a little while, won't you?&quot; There were tears in her eyes.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Is it very bad Mother - &quot; I started 
	to speak to her but stopped midway, realising that the tears were caused not 
	by physical pain but by love and worry for a child that would be left 
	behind... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[Yuriko B.M.] was born... apparently 
	a perfectly healthy baby </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yuriko's first and second birthdays 
	passed. My parents' third daughter was born, and still Yuriko neither spoke 
	nor walked... But when her younger sister was already prattling and toddling 
	about, Yuriko still showed no signs of development... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They went on hoping that one day she 
	would speak and walk normally... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Worried about what would happen to 
	Yuriko after their deaths, Mother and Father once sent a letter to the 
	United States government by way of the American commander of the Iwakuni Air 
	Force Installation, hoping to make arrangements to ensure Yuriko's 
	livelihood. The Japanese government had passed a nominal law related to 
	medical treatment for atom-bomb victims but showed no inclination to aid 
	them financially. This is why Mother and Father decided to apply to the 
	nation responsible for the bombing. Their request was shelved without 
	action... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In June 1968 Yuriko was at last 
	officially recognised as an atomic-bomb victim. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the hope that it would help the 
	drive to outlaw nuclear weapons, each August 6 Mother and Father took Yuriko 
	to the site of bombing and passed out leaflets... Some of the people to whom 
	I handed the leaflets looked annoyed and immediately threw the leaflets 
	away... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the middle of December, Mother 
	had grown weaker and could no longer see out of her left eye. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">About three days before her death, 
	the attacks of excruciating pain abated, and she grew so tranquil that we 
	were unable to tell the exact time of her death... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before the end she frequently said 
	that she had gone on living because of Yuriko. But at last her determination 
	and strength were exhausted. I shall never forget watching Yuriko, who did 
	not understand what death meant, sitting beside Mother and murmuring, &quot;Momma 
	sleep, Momma sleep.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On January 4 of the next year, 
	Father received a letter saying that, though Yuriko had been recognised as 
	an atom-bomb victim, Mother was not: she had not been sufficiently examined. 
	The letter was dated December 25, 1978, the day before her death... This 
	letter symbolises the heartlessness of government policy in dealing with 
	atom-bomb victims. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, sitting alone with Father, 
	Yuriko points to Mother's photograph and says over and over again, &quot;Momma 
	dead, Momma dead.&quot; Like a clock stopped forever at 8.15, the moment the bomb 
	fell... She and all others like her show how the misery of that abysmal 
	moment persists into the future. All the millions of words spoken and 
	written in the name of peace are necessary, but people should come to see my 
	sister and hear her murmur, &quot;Momma dead, Momma dead.&quot;&quot; </font></p>

	centuries ago. Very useful knowledge that! A sociology of the past perhaps? 
	But certainly not history in its most important sense; unless history is to 
	mean anything old or 'interesting' that you can do in evening classes, like 
	antiques, flower arranging or basket weaving. When instead I taught real 
	history, learning from the past in order to change the future, the 
	collective life-experience of humanity, I was got rid of. The head of the 
	history department complained that the students had remarked that I made 
	them think; which the head of history had probably never done in a lifetime 
	of teaching. I ended up washing and cleaning and emptying human surgical 
	waste in a hospital. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unless teachers learn to be brave

	aggrandisement and acquisition, causing the deaths and devastation of the 
	homes and lands of millions of people - the thousands of children under the 
	age of two who will die tonight through simple lack of food, clean water,
