	“Honorable Sirs, would you mind if I make you blind?” Probably you won’t

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-weight: normal">Those having the 
	experience of interrogation in the torture cell know, the torturers throw a 
	bright light on the face of the man to be tortured. And instantly the man 
	discovers, “too much light is another cause of blindness”. Today’s Cupids 
	are not in the torture chamber.&nbsp; they know&nbsp; themselves to have been free 
	citizens of democratic countries. (N.B.&nbsp; : We discard the case of the 
	Islamic countries. Their citizens are already ‘blind’ due to religion. 
	Absence or over presence of light does not matter anything for the blind 
	people). The Cupids of the developed countries cannot think of the corporate 
	bodies, specially the medias as torturers. That is exactly what happens to 
	men when they turn blind. </span></font></p>

	<span style="line-height: 150%; font-weight: normal">They do not know that 
	the medias blind the voters in election, the medias give wrong impression 
	about what happens in various countries, about what happens in the warring 
	countries, about who are responsible for the worsening situations in 
	different regions and so on so forth.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

	CONCLUSION :</span><span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Verdana">
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">One needs “eyes” to know the 
	reason of blindness. When someone is already blind due to the first, second 
	or the third reason, he loses the scope to know the reason. In the developed 
	countries, the strong corporate bodies and their stronger medias have 
	already blinded the common people. The people of the religious countries, by 
	all means, are blind. Those who, still do not have such strong medias can 
	see, how the medias play notorious roles in deceiving the common people. 
	They witness, how the “medias make the president of USA” and the blindfolded 
	people believe, “they have accomplished the great task”. </font></p>
