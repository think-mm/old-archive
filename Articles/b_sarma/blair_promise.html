					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>PROMISE OF THE 
					LEADER : </b>After the recent London bombing, in his 
					interview Mr. Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of UK promised 
					“NOT TO GIVE AN INCH” to the terrorists. Hearing incidents 
					of terrorism or seeing such scene on television, is in no 
					way comparable with the experiences of the victims who 
					suddenly hear the thunder and then find themselves trapped 
					in the underground tunnel hundred feet below the earth 
					amidst blood stained corpses and an environment with 
					decreasing oxygen. Expressing pity to see such incidents on 
					television is different from someone’s experience to know, 
					his son, daughter, wife, father, mother or brother all on a 
					sudden perished due to such an incident. In such a context, 
					Mr. Blair’s declaration “NOT TO GIVE AN INCH” to the 
					terrorists is the most expected decision from a statesman, a 
					leader, the democratically elected Prime Minister of a 
					country. Terrorism is a nasty trick that terrorizes innocent 
					citizens, causes immense damage to their persons and 
					properties and spoils the prestige of the nation. In such a 
					reality it is natural for the declaration by Mr. Blair 
					should be welcomed by all the citizens of the free world. 
					However, it is still a question that in the present context 
					how far he would be able to keep his promise and how. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>PROFITABILITY 
					FACTOR OF TERRORISM : </b>When a thief steals or a robber 
					robs, it is a loss for the persons robbed. But the same act 
					is profitable for the thief or the robber. Almost all the 
					actions deemed to be negative for some persons are, in one 
					or the other way ‘profitable’ for the others. The attack of 
					the terrorists on Pentagon and WTC on 9/11 was seen as a 
					loss for USA. Considering what happened afterwards the same 
					act may be adjudged to have been profitable for certain 
					persons. The US government imposed taxes on persons flying 
					in planes all over the world and earned a lot. We do not 
					know if returns from this account was less, equal or more 
					than what they monetarily lost in that incident. The 
					re-construction of the damaged Pentagon building brought 
					good earning to those who supplied materials and other 
					services. After the WTC building will be reconstructed, in 
					addition to the profit of those engaged in design and 
					construction, the owners would earn huge sum by renting 
					spaces at enhanced rate. There was no such scope of such 
					profit unless these buildings were destroyed and damaged. By 
					theses considerations, 9/11 may be taken to have been 
					“profitable” for a number of US citizens. And in case these 
					people were aware about the ‘profitability factor’ of such 
					an incident and in case they did not hesitate to have at the 
					cost of anything (including country’s prestige and a number 
					of deaths), there remains the possibility that they also had 
					‘contributions’ behind the incident. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>OUR EXPERIENCE 
					ABOUT THE USA</b> : CAPITALISTS OF USA : The people of the 
					US have come to the present state through experiences, some 
					of which were ‘unthinkable’ to the people of other regions. 
					Carrying men and women as cargo from another continent to be 
					used as slaves, selling men like animals in auction, in 
					“open-market” (was it the inspiration behind their “open 
					market economy” now being practiced over other countries ?) 
					in broad day-light etc. were some of the systems day 
					practiced. Till today, the rest of the world cannot be 
					credited or discredited to have followed any such system. I 
					know, some readers could not easily accept and probably 
					looked with disbelief when I wrote above, “And in case these 
					people were aware about the ‘profitability factor’ of such 
					an incident and in case they did not hesitate to have at the 
					cost of anything (including country’s prestige and a number 
					of deaths), there remains the possibility that they also had 
					‘contributions’ behind the incident”. I know, such a thought 
					is unnatural for a man. But is it unnatural for the men 
					whose ancestors used to sell and buy human being in auction 
					? </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>COMMON PEOPLE OF 
					USA : </b>When we say something about the people of USA, we 
					must be cautious. They are the people whose ancestors were 
					carried like cargo from Africa, who were sold in open 
					auction, whose dear sons died in Vietnam war and are now 
					dying in Iraq, who extended their support for the liberation 
					of Bangladesh from the grip of communal Pakistan, even 
					though their government not only supported, but also gave 
					arms and ammunitions to Pakistan government to kill us.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>THE GOVERNMENT OF 
					USA :</b> Not only we in Bangladesh, but the people of the 
					world outside USA fail to understand, what the Government of 
					USA is after, why this mighty government is acting so 
					queerly in its own land and the outside world. If they 
					discover any country governed by the most corrupt, tyrannic, 
					unpopular and mischievous type of government, they can be 
					sure, the government of USA is behind that government. If 
					they find a popular government of any country to fall due to 
					some mysterious activities, they can be sure, the government 
					of USA is behind those activities. Quite often the US-backed 
					governments act so tyrannically, so ruthlessly and so 
					foolishly that the suffering people use the term “son of a 
					bitch” to denote the head of such a government. And when 
					someone raise the natural question to the US, “Why do you 
					support this son of a bitch ?“, with a smiling face they 
					reply, “Well, if he is the son of a bitch, he is the son of 
					our bitch”. Ever since the second world war the government 
					of USA is transplanting the sons of their bitches in the 
					countries they can come across. We know, the US-government 
					is the government elected by the common people, who through 
					many decades were oppressed as slaves, auctioned as animals, 
					used as beasts and what not ? That reminds us, these men 
					know what is means by torture. It is natural for them to 
					elect persons who would honor their feeling. There is no 
					trace of their feeling in the activities done by the US 
					government in the world outside USA. That makes us to think, 
					probably due to a faulty system in their democratic (?) 
					election they in fact elect the persons selected by the 
					previous “human-auctioneers” who by this time have turned to 
					capitalists and who bear the major cost of election in the 
					caucus meeting. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>PENTAGON/WTC 
					INCIDENT AND THE US GOVERNMENT : </b>We, who are outside USA 
					believe, the Pentagon/WTC incident was painful for a large 
					number of US citizens, who lost their dear ones in the 
					buildings and the planes. Also a considerable number of 
					their citizen considers the incident as a ‘giant black spot’ 
					on the prestige of their fatherland. But we have a lot of 
					reasons to believe, the US-government thinks in a completely 
					different angle. USA is the country that entered in war in 
					Vietnam without any apparent benefit of their people or of 
					the country. In this war, the political influence, war 
					weapons and the capability USA were sufficient enough to 
					make the country winner within a period of maximum five 
					years. But what we found in reality was, the country fought 
					for long eighteen years, used arms and ammunitions several 
					thousand times of what was actually required, caused deaths 
					of millions of their enemies and thousands of their sons, 
					and finally came out defeated. Inside the country however, 
					the war-weapon manufacturers were making excellent business. 
					The common men grew unhappy because of the deaths of their 
					sons. (We have no information if only one son of the 
					weapon-manufacturers died in this war). Finally the 
					president listened to the cries of the common people and 
					came out of the wear. The war-weapon manufacturers could not 
					accept their loss in business and arranged his immediate 
					impeachment. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When we try to judge 
					the actions of the US government from our own experience, 
					quite often we are thrown in confusion. Quite often their 
					activities seems to us to be mysterious. But if we ask a 
					simple question “DOES THIS ACT SERVE THE INTEREST OF THE US 
					CAPITALISTS ?“ and we get the answer “YES” we can be sure 
					the US government would do that, even at the cost of deaths 
					of their citizens and curses of billions of men. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>CAUSE OF 
					TERRORISM :</b> In one of their statement the Al-Ahrami 
					said, &quot;Terrorism is a consequence of political ostracism,…. 
					It is fermented not in the mosques … or madrassas… “ etc. We 
					know there are million of mosques and madrasas all over the 
					world where no terrorism is practiced. At the same time 
					terrorism was practiced in a few madras in Pakistan and 
					Afghanistan. Who financed them and made them to appear as 
					Taleban ? It was the US government. Why ? We won’t 
					understand the reason. Definitely there was some financial 
					interest of their capitalists. Since then there has not been 
					any qualitative change in the election process in the USA, 
					such that we can take it granted that they still have the 
					same type of government. In such a situation, whatever the 
					US government may say against terrorism, we can be sure they 
					won’t really do anything fruitful till it serves the 
					interest of their financiers. Is not it strange that with 
					their most sophisticated equipments and gadgets the US 
					government cannot stop the man-slaughter in Iraq ? However, 
					if we think that the incidents in Iraq would create panic 
					among the Iraquis and people outside Iraque to such extent 
					that they would feel like carrying arms and ammunitions for 
					self-safety, (the news might bring hope for the 
					manufacturers) we might find reasons why the US government 
					is proving such apparent failure. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">USA AND UK : Long 
					before Mr. Blair declared war against terrorism, USA 
					declared the same with failure. We have discussed the basic 
					difference between the government of USA and other 
					governments. Whatever the US government may declare, they 
					would not do anything fruitful so long terrorism goes in 
					their financial interest. We know the objective of the UK 
					government cannot be the same. This government does not have 
					any obligation to satisfy the war-weapon manufacturers. In 
					such a situation the UK government can really stop 
					terrorism, if it intends so. In such program UK would have 
					to step alone or with countries suffering from similar 
					problems, or with like-minded countries, but NEVER with the 
					US government. If the UK government goes with the US 
					government, probably the US government would manipulate 
					their programs in such a way that the problem of terrorism 
					would not be solved, the sale of their light arms would 
					increase all over the world and finally, the UK government 
					would turn so unpopular and the UK-citizens would raise that 
					natural question “Why do you support this son of ….. ?”
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the greater 
					interest of his country and the countries outside US, I 
					request Mr. Tony Blair to keep his promise. I believe he can 
					do it only if he maintains wide distance from the US 
					government. And the reason is clear. </font></p>
