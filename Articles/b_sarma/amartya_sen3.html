  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">INTRODUCTION:</span></b></p>
  <p align="justify">Capitalization is an innocent word that means ‘to make the 
  best use of something’. Thus a man may capitalize his health for earning money 
  and fame, sporting capability for earning livelihood and so on. It should 
  however, be noted that a man cannot capitalize equally on all matters, and 
  that over capitalization on one factor is sure to negatively affect the 
  others. In the same way, a country may take a program to capitalize her 
  wealth. This is the act that we know as Capitalistic economy. Economics is the 
  subject in which Professor Amartya Kumar Sen is an authority. We know the 
  economists have suggested numerous ways to ‘capitalize wealth’. When USA, a 
  country of immigrants was suffering from the tremendous pressure of demands 
  for wealth from the fortune-seeker immigrants, their political leaders thought 
  of producing or having ‘more wealth’. By this time they were accustomed to 
  acquire wealth through ‘animal-like use of human being’ in the role of slaves. 
  The political leaders found the ways advocated by some economists (Adam Smith, 
  John Stuart Mill etc.) suitable to achieve this goal. That was how capitalism 
  as economic policy was adopted in the USA. The way Capitalism is defined as 
  ‘capitalization of wealth’ Democracy may be defined as ‘Capitalization of 
  welfare of the citizens’.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">After USA adopted this policy (e.g. by ‘capitalization of 
  factors like mechanized cultivation, irrigation, superior seeds and 
  fertilizers etc.), the country witnessed a boom in agro-production. The same 
  thing happened in industrial production due to ‘capitalization of factors like 
  division of labor, specialized machineries, mono-trained workers etc. However, 
  the country adopted other policies also for having wealth and we shall mention 
  those in the later part of this article. The world was amazed to witness the 
  tremendous success of capitalism in USA. As we mentioned, capitalization of 
  one factor eats up the fruit of another, happened in this case also. Their 
  capitalization of wealth capitalization earned success at the cost of 
  exploitation of human being. The time when Prof. Sen worked in that country he 
  saw or had to see ‘capitalism’ from one particular angle. Now it is time for 
  him to look at the same from various other angles, specially the one from 
  which we look at it. We confess, our outlook is narrow. Prof. Sen is the 
  person who can widen our angle of view.</p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">BEHIND THE SUCCESS 
  OF CAPITALISM:</span></p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">Even before the concept capitalism germinated in USA, the 
  country was quite ‘wealthy’ with huge land, animals, mineral resources and few 
  people. The country was further fortunate to ‘avail’ the African slaves as 
  cheap labor force. Industrial revolution tremendously helped the country to 
  establish the backbone of industrial production. As for cheap labor, illegal 
  immigrants fulfill that need. There supply is almost inexhaustible, because 
  when one group gets citizenship another group arrives. The country was 
  fortunate to ‘avail’ the scopes that were created by a number of wars abroad. 
  The country earned huge profit from her ‘war-economics’ in which wars or 
  war-like situations were created in various regions and war-equipments sold at 
  the highest price. These activities enriched the country to such extent that, 
  in case equally distributed, probably each of her citizens could become a 
  millionaire. Instead, however, only a few were made billionaires. The 
  confidence of the citizens on the government was firmly established by 
  assuring ‘allowance during no job period’ and a minimum standard of living. It 
  is interesting to note that this ‘minimum standard’ is much better than most 
  other countries. So, the citizens found no reason to complain even after they 
  witnessed that, ‘capitalism’ has stopped the fair play of democracy in their 
  land. Following the success of &quot;war-economics&quot; (it is an out of home policy), 
  the country adopted other out of home policies like WTO (World Trade 
  Organization), OME (Open Market Economy), WCF (Willful collapse of Firms) 
  etc., which do not hamper the interest of her own citizens, but is capable of 
  squeezing out wealth from abroad.</p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</p>
  </font>
  <p align="justify"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">EVALUATION OF 
  SUCCESS:</span></p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">Even a candid evaluation indicates, capitalism is not very 
  successful in the USA. Quite often the strong economy of the country is taken 
  as the criteria of the grand success of capitalism, but in fact it is not so. 
  A careful observation that the country earned most of her wealth not due to 
  their capitalistic system of agro-industrial production, but from the two 
  other sources viz. (a) few people and vast wealth and (b) ‘war-economics’. 
  These two are the greatest contributors to US economy. As a matter of fact, 
  many a times their capitalistic economy needed to have been and still being 
  subsidized from other sources. For example, (a) their improved and mechanized 
  cultivation raised the price of agro-products to such an extent that neither 
  local consumers nor external market could consume those. As a solution, huge 
  subside was given to the farmers by their government. This may be taken as a 
  failure of their ‘capitalistic agro-production system’. We should not forget 
  most of the large farmers are ‘capitalists’, who are the real masters of the 
  USA. (b) In the Industrial sector the modern plants were so efficient that, it 
  was difficult to find out markets for their ‘round the year production’. So 
  the industrialists have adopted a policy of periodic lock out, during which 
  time the workers are paid sustenance allowance by the government. In this 
  case, the laborers suffer due to less pay, but the industrialists enjoy profit 
  because the government pays the cost for the labor during no-work months. This 
  is another example of secret subside by the government. So, this also may be 
  considered as a failure of the ‘capitalistic industrial production system’. By 
  this time we already know, the owners of these industries are the 
  ‘capitalists’, the real masters.<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&nbsp;</p>
  </b></font>
  <p align="justify">We have already mentioned in another article why there is 
  no hope for democracy to have a fair play in a country where the exploitable 
  items lies in the hands of the few. It is known to all that this ‘few’ are the 
  capitalists, who enjoys the real political power by dint of their financial 
  status and do whatever goes in their favor. It is no wonder that they get they 
  always the result of the democratic election in their favor.</p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</p>
  </font>
  <p align="justify"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">RECENT EXPERIENCES:</span></p>
  <font face="Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</font></font></b>In the recent decades US firms are 
  advocating GMS (Genetically Modified Seeds) in the non-US countries. These 
  seeds are so harmful for the nature’s ecology that their own country does not 
  allow it. As for markets for exporting US products, the country is pressing 
  hard to get entry into other countries. To prove the ‘innocence’ in their 
  proposal they say, their markets also would be equally open for these 
  countries. It has been mentioned that many of their agro and industrial 
  products are in fact subsidized, which probably they could manage from their 
  income from war-economics. Whenever there would raise a question of 
  competitive price, how many non-US countries would be able to compete ? In USA 
  there are government specified rules regarding preparation, processing, 
  packaging and labeling of products, along with such provisions like whether 
  the producing companies used child labors, or their laborers have the right to 
  trade union and so on. The USA has reached in the present state as a result of 
  steady progress for a long period of time, during which their industries were 
  subsidized and served by cheap laborers like slaves or illegal immigrants. How 
  can the non-US countries with so different contextual background expect to do 
  that ? However, in the interest of their citizens the USA deserves the right 
  to ban any imported items in case the above conditions are not fulfilled. At 
  present they are not saying much about implementing those. But it is quite 
  likely that they would apply those ‘weapons’ to the country of their disliking 
  in right time. By this time, their dumped products in those countries would do 
  the targeted job, i.e. closing their productive industries.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">It is not difficult to discover that in the US governments 
  policy there is a tendency to indirectly transfer public money lying with the 
  government to the accounts of the capitalists. When war weapons are destroyed 
  and new weapons are purchased, the US citizens lose their children and hard 
  earned money deposited with the government as taxes. As owners of war-weapon 
  manufacturing firms, the capitalists enjoy the benefit. At times the US 
  government is found to be too generous in giving aids to poor countries. At 
  times they give loans, knowing fully well those would never be recovered. All 
  these aids or bad debts are deducted from the people’s deposit with the 
  government. The government follows this policy because in all such deals there 
  remains a clause of supply of equipments and products from US firms. So, while 
  the US citizens are deprived the capitalists are benefited from such aids and 
  bad debts. It may not be out of place to mention their latest invention. This 
  ‘invention may be called ‘Willful Collapse of Firms’ (WCF). It is known to all 
  that a number of renowned US firms have collapsed. With each such collapse 
  billions of people’s and other organizations’ money in fact secretly vanishes 
  in few accounts. Because of tremendous complexities in their financial 
  managements and policies the names and identities of the losers are not 
  readily known. But definitely there are losers both at home and abroad. And 
  the people working in those companies are both losers and sufferers. Probably 
  the government would not be able to pin point the cause and identify the 
  culprits behind such collapse of firms. At times innocent employees might be 
  held responsible. And on rare occasions the real ‘man’ may be seen behind the 
  bars. But probably the man won’t mind for that. By this time he has carefully 
  calculated and discovered that a few year’s jail term for several b/million 
  dollars is not a bad deal. So, whatever might happen to the workers, 
  share-holders, bankers or other financiers of these collapsed companies, more 
  and more such companies would be facing such willful ‘collapse’ in future. In 
  the coming days, intelligent brains employed by the capitalists would 
  formulate newer and much better inventions, which would take away billions of 
  dollars belonging to the people silently and intelligently. We would witness 
  those, but shall not be able to do anything, because we won’t have the power. 
  Those who would have the power (the government) would see those, but won’t do 
  anything, because of the fact that, &quot;in capitalistic economy, the 
  democratically elected government has to work as lobbying agents of the few 
  capitalists&quot;.</p>

  <p align="justify"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">CONCLUSION :</span></p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">We discussed the topics related to capitalism and their 
  role towards our countries to the best of our knowledge and ability. We know 
  Prof. Amartya Sen is a world-renowned expert and an authority in this 
  discipline. His writings and comments bear the weight, which no one can 
  surpass. But the important question is, whether he will be interested in these 
  topics. In view of the tremendous problem the non-US countries are now 
  suffering due to various US policies give us an idea that the capitalistic 
  policy the USA followed so long has been proved at least partial failure and 
  that is the reason why the country is extending its hands of exploitation 
  outward with motivated proposals and demands. It would be highly appreciated 
  if Prof. Sen could endeavor to find out the facts and enlighten us further.</p>
