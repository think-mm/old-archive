  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">INTRODUCTION: </span></b></p>
  <p>In the current article, by “Great men” I want to mean persons whom we now 
  consider ‘great’ because they have been adjudged great by the westerners. A 
  person awarded Nobel Prize for Economics by the westerners is no doubt 
  ‘great’. If the person hails from the west, he does not have any problem, but 
  prospects, because he has already proved the cause of his greatness. But when 
  this hails from the developing world, he faces problems if the cause of his 
  greatness in not proved in this region. This is exactly what has happened with 
  Professor Amartya Kumar Sen. After the award of such an honor from alien hands 
  Prof. Sen has got lots of works to do for his own country. We are to keep in 
  mind that his motherland could not yet decide, why this person is to be 
  considered great. Why ? Because they know, the honor Prof. Sen was awarded by 
  the west was ‘due to fulfilling the criteria set by them’. This is the great 
  problem that lies before Professor Amartya Kumar Sen, the 1998 Nobel laureate 
  in Economics. In this article I shall discuss some of the problems, this great 
  man still have to encounter.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">AMARTYA</span><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">
  </span><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">SEN</span><span style="background-color: #00FFFF"> 
  AND HIS WORKS:</span></b> </p>
  <p>The developing countries enable a person to have only limited access to 
  Prof. Sen’s works. In these works we have seen Prof. Sen’s comments, views and 
  explanations which mostly go in the interest of the governments of the 
  capitalistic countries. We do not wonder, because we know that was and is the 
  essential precondition of a person to be honored by them. For example, Prof. 
  Sen opined against those who are against Globalization, opined that democracy 
  does nor work under socialist or military rulers, maximum welfare of the 
  common people can be ensured under democratic system etc. While there cannot 
  be any dispute in the last one, it is time for Prof. Sen to rethink the two 
  others entirely from a different angle. In this article I shall discuss the 
  issues on Globalization only.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">‘GLOBALIZATION’, THE WRONGLY 
  USED TERM:</span></b></p>
  <p>I have seen Prof. Sen’s comments advocating that ‘globalization is a 
  natural process and no cool brain should think anything against it’. We are 
  aware lots of people in the developed and developing countries are at present 
  engaged in fights against globalization. When a world-renowned economist like 
  Prof. Sen opines like that the capitalist countries feel safe. I do not blame 
  the common men, for using the wrong term, it is natural for them to fail to 
  understand the difference between globalization and the thing they are 
  fighting against. I do not blame the capitalist countries also who appreciate 
  the use of the wrong term. Definitely they become benefited due to such 
  ‘wrong-use’. (I even feel tempted to believe that that the capitalists 
  themselves have encouraged to use the wrong term, such that the real enemy may 
  hide behind a harmless word). But we do not expect a world famous economist 
  like Prof. Sen to abstain from clarifying the points. They call it 
  ‘Globalization’. Let me continue using the same term till I can clarify the 
  point. The poor and working men from the developed countries shout against 
  ‘globalization’ because they say, it takes away jobs from their hands either 
  by taking away their working stations from their country or (ii) by importing 
  cheap labors from abroad. Similarly the industrial workers from the developing 
  countries cry against ‘globalization’ because, they say it stops their job 
  opportunities by closing their industries. The environmentalists in various 
  countries raise voices against ‘globalization’ because they say, it spoils 
  their environment.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN : </span>
  </b></p>
  <p>It is interesting to note that all these people use the wrong term (i.e. 
  ‘globalization’ ) to mean the right thing, which in this case is their 
  greatest enemy. Let us now investigate what these people indicate or really 
  mean by ‘globalization’. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(a) When the poor and working men from developed countries say, 
    ‘globalization’ takes away their jobs, they indicate a system in which the 
    large companies shift their industries and service organizations to 
    developed countries to utilize the benefit of ‘lesser wage’.</p>
    <p>(b) When the industrial workers from the developing countries say 
    ‘globalization’ turns them jobless, they indicate a system that constantly 
    closes their industries.</p>
    <p>(c) When the environmentalists in various countries raise voices against 
    spoiling of environment they indicate the situation in which the corporate 
    companies exploit their nature and resources beyond sustainable limit in 
    their own interest. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When the savage society with adult males and females and ample 
  opportunities of sex could not find peace, men invented marriage and family. 
  Families wanted a secure place to live, work and raise children. Rural 
  community, towns, cities etc. were the results of this endeavor. Later, 
  however, a state or country with its extents in terms of land, resources and 
  population was found to be the practical solution. Like a family devised its 
  own system of income, expenditure, security arrangement and administration, 
  individual countries also devised such means. What happens if the robust young 
  man of one family wants to enjoy the women, snatch the income and interfere 
  the administration of another family ? the answer is, “complete turmoil”. The 
  same thing is now going to take place in the community of countries when few 
  capitalist countries have chalked out a program to take the benefit of 
  ‘everything that is good and enjoyable’ in the weaker countries. And they 
  intend to do the same due to the provisions allowed in the ‘open market 
  economy’. This ‘open market economy’ also had been devised by them for 
  ensuring the interest of the capitalistic and powerful countries. It is 
  correct that no person with a normal and cool brain should ever say anything 
  against the “globalization” which is quite natural. In fact any war waged 
  against this innocent thing seems to have been a foolish act, isn’t it ? That 
  is the reason why the ventures of the sufferers of the developing and 
  developed countries and that of the environmentalists could not still reach 
  the targets. What these people want to fight against is in fact ‘certain 
  provisions kept in the open market economy’. It is so easy for any student of 
  economics to understand. Naturally it hurts me to see that a great man like 
  Prof. Sen does not reveal to the ‘facts’ to the sufferers, and continue using 
  the wrong term (i.e.‘globalization’).</p>
  <p>If ‘open market economy’ be allowed to continue with its present 
  provisions, it would result in numerous silent murders, where poor and working 
  people in the developed and developing countries would lose jobs, resulting in 
  early death, less marriage and inability to propagate. Also the same would 
  result in open murder when the environmental pollutions created by 
  multi-national companies would kill innocent people living around.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">BLESSINGS:</span></b> </p>
  <p>One blessing of open market might be ‘less sale of war weapons to the 
  states’. Battalion of armed forces, however, would have to be maintained by 
  the capitalistic companies to safeguard their properties. Since the countries 
  would have practically no control over import and export, movement of currency 
  and people, there won’t be any tussle or fight between countries. The war 
  weapon producers would definitely loose market. By this time probably they 
  have calculated their loss from this business and have discovered that the 
  income they can have from their ‘open market economy’ is going to exceed the 
  loss. </p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">OUTCOME : </span></b></p>
  <p>Believe it or not, in case open market economy is allowed to continue in 
  its present form, the current system of sovereign states and their 
  administrative governments would practically vanish. What would remain in 
  their place would be the estates and territories controlled and administered 
  by capitalistic lords by their own muscle men. The world has once witnessed 
  the curse of Feudalism. Open market economy is going to generate Feudalism in 
  another form in which the kings or emperors are going to be replaced by the 
  capitalists through their multi-national companies, in which the exploitation 
  of the common people in their interests shall remain in their hands, where as 
  the administration and taking care of the common people would be in the hands 
  of the government. They would rightly use the governments as their slaves, 
  because they would bear their costs.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">MORE CURSES FROM THE 
  CAPITALISTS:</span></b></p>
  <p>In their own interests, the capitalists would bring new provisions in 
  future under various names. Even if part of those come to the interest of the 
  common men that would be just coincidental. Never in the past the capitalists 
  considered it as their noble duty or obligation to solve the problems of the 
  common people, nor they would ever do. One such policy that is already in 
  vision is ‘collapse of multi-national companies’. A number of such companies 
  have already collapsed. It is because of tremendous complexities in their 
  financial managements and systems (please note, they have devised those 
  systems ensuring their own interests. Their governments endorse those because 
  they have the money to purchase the governments’ decision) it is not readily 
  known who loose their money and how. But you can be sure, the persons who win 
  are the capitalists. Even though at times they may be seen behind the bars, 
  they have carefully calculated and discovered that a say, ‘five year jail 
  term’ would ensure them physical rest along with ‘tremendous income’ (several 
  times of what they could earn by usual business during this period). So, 
  whatever might happen to the workers, share-holders, bankers or other 
  financiers of these collapsed companies, more and more such companies would 
  face willful ‘collapse’ in the coming days. I request Prof. Sen to take a 
  project to find out the facts behind the collapse of such companies and to 
  forewarn the probable victims. </p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">CONCLUSION:</span></b></p>
  <p>It is our great pleasure and honour that Prof. Sen has brought the rare 
  honor of Nobel Prize for himself and for all of us in India and Bangladesh. By 
  achieving this honour he has achieved such an elevated position that whatever 
  he now speaks, all in the east and the west have to hear his voice. I have 
  mentioned that Prof. Sen’s target to achieve such an honor by fulfilling the 
  criteria set by them is over. It is useless for him to go for another Nobel 
  prize, by ignoring the interest of his own people. In case he can forget 
  another prize from them, Prof. Sen can look at things un-biasedly, or with a 
  bias towards the welfare of his own country. Prof. Sen is our pride, we want 
  to be more proud with his future works, even though we know we can’t give him 
  any prize. But we can adore him as ‘our great man’. </p>
