  <p><b>INTRODUCTION : </b></p>
  <p>Intelligence indicates the capability of a man as expressed in thinking, 
  taking decision and working in the right and logical directions. This 
  capability primarily depends upon the quality and quantity of 'gray matter' 
  contained inside the skull. Men inherit those from their parents. Men acquire 
  knowledge, which is nothing but information and experience given by others. 
  Then, in the practical field man uses those also alongside his own 
  intelligence. The intelligence of a man develops due to the interventions of 
  numerous factors like formal education, parents' teaching, contribution of the 
  society etc. When we judge the intelligence of a man we judge both i.e. the 
  man's own intelligence plus his acquired knowledge and experience. It may now 
  be clear why an aged man of rural Africa is adjudged 'less intelligent' than a 
  ten-year old boy of USA. In order to be 'intelligent' a boy must be given full 
  freedom to develop his 'logical thoughts'. (Sometimes logical thoughts are 
  mentioned as scientific reasoning also). Religion, that forces men to 
  'believe' without '<i>any evidence or reason</i>' retards the development of 
  scientific reasoning that helps to develop intelligence. So, it is no wonder 
  that '<i>the religious believers are less intelligent than those who 
  disbelieve it</i>'. There are numerous examples and evidences to prove it.</p>
  <p>For inventing or creating anything new one needs intelligence. The people 
  of the countries having strong religious faith could not show excellence in 
  scientific inventions. Most of such countries rely upon items invented and 
  manufactured by the secular countries. Once upon a time the Muslim countries 
  conquered some European countries. These countries were rich in scientists and 
  scientific resources including numerous laboratories. The Muslims got all 
  those at hand, but they could not excel in it do much because of the conflict 
  between science and religion or the 'blockade' created in their brains by 
  religious faith.</p>
  <p>If one goes for a comparison of men on the basis of the above mentioned 
  criteria one may be left with the following types : <b>(a)</b> Non-Lesdebs, 
  i.e. men grown intelligent due to environment ensured for the development of 
  logical thoughts and <b>(b)</b> Lesdeb's, i.e. men grown less-intelligent due 
  to blockade applied on logical thoughts by religions. <i>The term 'LESDEB' is 
  a new invention, that indicates men with &quot;LESs DEveloped Brains&quot; due to 
  religion. We shall use these two terms through out this article.</i></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>WHAT MAKES A MAN 'LESDEB' : </b></p>
  <p>Let us now try to find out how Lesdeb's grow in this world. You can go to 
  Africa and tell to an illiterate rural man &quot;Look man, I know someone named God 
  has created this world&quot;. Probably the man would believe, because of his little 
  knowledge and his world that extends little beyond his village. You may tell 
  the samething to a ten-year old boy of USA. He would disbelieve and say 
  'impossible'. Why ? Because even at this age the boy has come to know how 
  large the world and the universe are. He can easily understand, it is not 
  possible for 'someone' to create it.</p>
  <p>Now you may try in another way. Quite often the Lesdeb intellectuals use 
  it. Tell the boy, 'well, god is not a person, but a force that has created all 
  these. Do you believe ?' The boy might say, 'well it may be possible'. Now 
  follow the style of the Lesdeb intellectual and tell him, 'You see, this 
  extremely powerful force is keeping record of everything happening in this 
  world. He is keeping a record of your actions also. He would punish and reward 
  you for your bad and good acts respectively'. At this the little boy would 
  smile and lose interest. While the matured Lesdeb's find this explanation so 
  'logical' and 'believable' a normal boy discovers mere 'laughing stock' in it. 
  The Lesdeb's forget the fact that, in the distant past some men with vested 
  interest fabricated things that might go in their own interest and also in the 
  interest of their descendants or disciples.</p>
  <p><b>GOD AND RELIGION : </b></p>
  <p>For the Lesdeb's 'God is a reality who would punish the crime-doer for his 
  act' (At the beginning they used to say, god would punish the crime-doers 
  right in this world. When men discovered it was wrong, the preachers told, the 
  punishment would be given after death. In this case they enjoyed the benefit 
  of doubt, because till today we do not know what really happens after death. 
  However, there is a strong possibility that everything ends up with death). 
  Let us cite some arguments frequently used by the Lesdeb intellectuals. They 
  say, 'well, God may be an imaginary thing. But even the scientists at times 
  use imaginary thing like 'x' to denote unknown number'. The intelligent reply, 
  however, is, the scientists imagine 'x' and finally arrive at a number from 
  it. What benefit the Lesdeb's get from god ? The Lesdeb's have a good 
  explanation. They say &quot;We endeavor to create good men by using imaginary god'. 
  I know, at this point my readers cannot help smiling to remember, what type of 
  men the Lesdeb's are, or what type of men their religions create. I won't cite 
  any example, because those are numerous. I must say, 'if you want to create 
  good men, you would need a good God. Can you say your God is good ?'</p>
  <p>Let us have a candid look at the Gods of some prominent religions. Suppose 
  I have committed a crime, say I have murdered a man. What the gods of various 
  religions prescribe for me ?</p>
  <p>Lesdeb : Well, the God (of A, B and C religion) would punish you. </p>
  <p>Victim : How can I get rid of it ? </p>
  <p>Lesdeb : According to A by praying to A-God, according to B by worshipping 
  to B-God, according to C by murdering an animal for C-God.</p>
  <p>Excepting Buddhism all the prominent religions give the above 
  prescriptions. Please think over the matter. I have murdered a man, the God 
  would relieve me from punishment if I can bribe him in by praising, praying, 
  offering materials etc. It is highly unfortunate that the Lesdeb's fail to 
  discover, by imagining God in this way they have in fact pictured him as 
  'bribe-taker'. </p>
  <p>I am citing another example. The Gods of the Lesdeb's want me to be a 
  perfect or good man. Is God himself good, perfect or impartial ? We know of 
  one God, due to whose wish God's own son died due to crucification. (At this 
  point the lay man asks, 'why should I ask for the help of someone who could 
  not save his own son ?' I won't ask that question because I know their 
  explanation that God's son would bear the pains of the sinners, such that the 
  sinners may get pardon). Look, Tom, Dick and Harry are doing crimes today, and 
  god's own son got the punishment in order to make them 'pardoned' . Could God 
  do justice to his own son ? If you call this justice, would someone tell me 
  which one is injustice ?</p>
  <p>In the above case God was over-cruel to his son. Another God has been seen 
  to have been too lenient to his favorite disciple. From authentic books we 
  know, this disciple did things like multiple marriage, marrying and divorcing 
  relatives, marrying close relative etc. The followers of that religion were 
  not allowed to do these, indicating those were not fair. But God allowed those 
  to his disciple, who by all means is to act as the pathfinder. And the 
  Lesdeb's fail to discover the grave inconsistency in it. And now the last 
  example. This is an imaginary dialogue between a little boy of a developed 
  country and an aged Lesdeb.</p>
  <p>Boy - I need to pass the examination. What should I do ? </p>
  <p>Lesdeb - Well, pray to God. He would give you success. </p>
  <p>Boy - Shall I have to read and write ? </p>
  <p>Lesdeb - Oh yes, you have to study hard. </p>
  <p>Boy - Well, if I study hard I know I shall succeed. Why then should I waste 
  my time and energy in praying to your god ?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>LOOKING WITH LESDEB'S EYES : </b></p>
  <p>A patient suffering from yellow fever finds yellow color everywhere. He 
  wonders why other people do not see it. Same is the case with the Lesdeb's. 
  They find intelligence only in the Lesdeb's works, even though they profusely 
  depend on items invented by others. While attacking the non-Lesdeb 's the 
  Lesdeb's even use the weapons invented by them. Being highly religious the so 
  called 'heroes of the 9/11' were Lesdeb's. Definitely their mission was to 
  glorify their own religion. Due to their act on September 11, the world 
  shuddered to see their cruelty, inhumanity and barbarism. Could they glorify 
  their religion ? Is their any reason to think, those people were intelligent ?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>CONCLUSION : </b></p>
  <p>In the contemporary world Lesdeb-ism is a disease. Frustration is its prime 
  symptom. In extreme frustration the patients usually reappear as suicide 
  bombers or terrorists. The contemporary world is having extreme sufferings 
  from Lesdeb-ism. It is an infectious disease. The two ways in which men may 
  remain safe from infectious diseases are : (01) Cure the patient and (02) Stay 
  away from such patient. So far we know, still today the non-Lesdeb's have not 
  been able to invent any medicine for curing this disease. In absence of 
  medicine they apply surgery, as they are now doing in Afghanistan, Iraq etc. 
  Even though effective, such surgery, however, takes too much blood from the 
  patient and so also from the surgeon. Let us hope, a good medicine would soon 
  be invented to cure this fatal disease.</p>
