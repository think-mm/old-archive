  also their aggressiveness of propaganda, techniques used, cooperation of the 
  political parties, persons employed in preaching, time and extent of broadcast 
  etc. Quite often we have seen&nbsp; prominent medias to present items like, “Bush 
  has got xx% rise in popularity in x days, Kerry had yy% decrease in y days” 
  etc. We did not believe those because we know how the medias fabricate or 
  manipulate those by using numerous techniques including using paid personnel.

  they do it not due to the influence of any media, but due to the activities of

  countries etc. They also could not accept the activities of one of their 
  ex-presidents for telling lies after taking oath and the failure of their 
  system to impeach the person. The case of ‘99.9% (this figure is wrong) of

  think, at last the country that is after other’s harm has got a ‘reward’. And 
  if there is any truth in Mr. Alamgir’s statement that ‘100.00% (this figure

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Mr. Bijon Sarma's article 
  in question took issues with recent US election and Bush's Iraq war policies. 
  He concluded that those, who supported Bush in the election and on Iraq war, 
  suffers from all kinds of blindness including a third one, the media 
  blindness. I requested him to give us an statistics on distribution of the US 
  media divided on the pro-Bush (rightist) and Pro-Kerry (liberal/leftist) line 
  during the <u>elction</u> or along the pro-War and anti-War line in general. 
  He came back here with a Mohabharat which is loaded with gibberish and his 
  personal opinions, from which I found hard to make up anything as far as my 
  request to him is concerned. He could simply present us with concrete data on 
  Media, instead of making us take a wasteful journey through his personal 
  thoughts and opinion on various issues, which is so common amongst <u>Bdeshi</u> 
  Public.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial"><br>
  It is very simple that during US election in particular, there were a deluge 
  of anti-Bush commentaries all over the US media as <u>comapred</u> to 
  pro-Kerry one. Amongst major media, Fox News is the one solidly Pro-Bush. 
  MSNBC is also inclined towards Republicans or centrist but I am not sure how 
  much media propaganda they do or did in favour of bush during the election. 
  All other media in the US had taken a neutral to pro-Kerry (pro-left/liberal) 
  stand throughout the election campaign. US print media in particular were 
  strongly anti-Bush and anti-War. If given a google search on US election on 
  the cyber-world, one always ended up with greater number of anti-Bush 
  commentaries within US.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;<br>
  The fact remains that there was less media publicity in favour of Bush than 
  Kerry's. There was never a case that 80-90% media propaganda was pro-Bush that 
  could blind Americans to support Bush. Outside US, the media was solidly 
  anti-Bush and anti-War. In </span>
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">Bangladesh</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">, 
  India, the media was 100.00% anti-Bush and anti-War. And Mr. Sarma and his 
  countrymen have higher chances to be blinded by the media than the American 
  would. 99.9% of <u>Bdeshi</u> people hate Bush is just a reflection of 100% 
  anti-Bush media brain-washing prevalent there. When I visited Bangladesh last 
  time, I had a chat about Iraq war with 5-6 friends. They were after the blood 
  of Bush &amp; the US because of the Iraq war. After I tried to explain to them an
  <u>alterntaive</u> view-point (from Pro-War or American perspective), atleast 
  2 of those friends are solid supporters of the war now, whilst others are

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp;<br>
  Given these facts, Mr Sarma's assertion that Bush supporters are blinded by 
  dominantly pro-Bush media propaganda is absolutely incorrect and a blatant 
  lie. Mr Sarma could have done better by not making such insulting comments on 
  greater majority of Americans and his small group of outside-US supporters 
  based on thoughtless assumption and unsubstantiated facts.<br>
