  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">INTRODUCTION: </span></b></p>
  <p>Even though Prof. Amartya Kumar Sen is basically an economist, from his 
  works it is clear how keenly he observes the relation of this subject with 
  various subjects like the government, politics. sociology etc. So far one can 
  understand him through his works, Prof. Sen he believes democracy to be the 
  ever best system of political administration. His criticism for the 
  communistic-socialistic cum military administration in China, that brought him 
  wide fame is known all over the world. He identified the lack of democracy as 
  a dominant factor behind the famines in China. However, any person with common 
  sense can understand, beyond communistic, socialistic or military forms of 
  governments there are numerous factors which eat the essential green leaves of 
  democracy-tree, before it can stand on its own backbone. The ‘context’ in 
  which Prof. Sen so long worked to prepare his scholarly works ‘probably’ 
  encouraged him to write against what that ‘contextual forces’ disliked. Since 
  Prof. Sen is now out of and away from that context he can look at these 
  problems impartially. We know he has a deep root in Indian soil, such deep 
  that the distress of his countrymen deeply concerns his feelings. By achieving 
  the highest honor in his discipline Prof. Sen he has placed himself in a 
  position where from he can make this world to listen what he thinks. This is 
  the most appropriate time for him to find out the real enemies of democracy. 
  In the current article I shall present a few of those for Prof. Sen’s kind 
  attention.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">COMMUNISM / SOCIALISM / MILITARY 
  RULES FOR THE PEOPLE:</span></b> </p>
  <p>The harsh truth of this world is ‘All men are not equal’. The plain meaning 
  of this line is, ‘neither all men are not created with equal capability, nor 
  all men’s needs are equal’. In such a reality ‘demanding equal works from all 
  and sanctioning equal provisions for all’ is a wrong concept. Even the 
  socialists who shout for ‘equality’ don’t endorse this idea (even though their 
  critics often say, say do). What they demand is ‘all persons would work to the 
  best of his ability and enjoy to the most of his need’. This is an impossible 
  proposition, because men would never acquire such noble and impossible 
  qualities. As a matter of fact it is never possible to quantify men’s 
  abilities and needs. Still the advocators of socialism/communism would expect 
  to do that. There is no doubt, they would have to apply ‘force’ in various 
  magnitudes to imply those. Thus socialism is an erroneous concept. The only 
  appreciable thing that lies in communism/socialism concept is, it is the 
  outcome of some men who earnestly wanted to find out a mechanism by which the 
  distress of the poorest men could come to an end. They observed the 
  administrative of various countries and discovered, most of the citizens are 
  oppressed and only a few are privileged. Naturally they thought, since the 
  administration of few privileged men cannot solve the problem of the majority, 
  definitely the administration of many would be able to do that. Democracy in 
  fact is the administration of the majority through a mechanism in which 
  people’s endorsements are conveyed through their representatives. Thus the 
  problem they encountered had the solution in democracy. At this context they 
  discovered a major weakness in democracy. They saw, the various concept of 
  impartial election in democracy is foiled by people who are capable of 
  manipulating the common people’s endorsements due to their money or productive 
  machines. Naturally they concentrated on two things : (a) Taking away all the 
  instruments that could be used by the public in manipulating fair election and 
  (b) Forming a ‘party’ with men with certain qualities and proven records of 
  dedication to work for the common men. Socialism-communism may totally vanish 
  from this world for genuine reason, but the intelligence, sincerity and 
  greatens shown by its advocators for the distressed minority of this world 
  would never vanish. The saddest part of Socialism-communism is, before its 
  advocators could finish the paper works, some army generals discovered an 
  excellent ‘provision’ in it. This provision is, in Socialism-communism there 
  is a post of the party chairman, who, for all practical purposes enjoy the 
  privileges of a dictator. Naturally, the army generals picked up this policy, 
  such that they could rule the country as dictator in the disguise of people’s 
  representative. However, even after a long time they failed to produce 
  ‘dedicated workers’ not to say anything about men with that rare qualities. On 
  the other hand, when the productive instruments were given in the hands of the 
  administrators, who were in need of ‘backing’ from the workers, those could 
  not show efficiency. The country under the dictatorship of the ex-military 
  general, however, demonstrated the discipline, steady progress and the type of 
  peace that any country under the military rule shows.</p>
  <p>The success of the military administration towards solving the problems of 
  the common men depends upon how far the ‘man on the top’ or the dictator feels 
  for the common men, how far his courtiers give him proper and how far his 
  deputies abide by his decisions. We know these are quite far and by now any 
  civilized country should consider military rule as a disgrace for the country.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">DEMOCRATIC RULE :</span></b></p>
  <p>When we intend to administer the people of a country who widely differ in 
  religion, sex, aspiration and ability to work, and when it is not possible to 
  get all the people at hand at the time of making laws and formulating 
  policies, the only workable solution to accomplish this ‘great’ job is to get 
  it done by their representatives. That is what ‘Democracy’ stands for. There 
  is no guarantee that the elected representative would do ‘the best’ for the 
  people. In case they ‘do not do that’ the people reserves the right to oust 
  them. What can be a better solution than this ? If the majority of people fail 
  to elect the ‘best’ representative, they would suffer from the consequences. 
  And if even the majority cannot find out the best for themselves, how can a 
  dictator, military general of chairman of a party should expect, they could do 
  the best ? So, till today Democracy is considered as the best system of 
  administration. However, the harsh reality is, this system has failed to 
  perform its role in any part of the world. Since we have no other option at 
  hand, it is high time for us to find out the reasons behind the malfunction of 
  this system and endeavor to eradicate those. First of all let us look at the 
  major types of ‘irregularities’ observed in democracy.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">DEMOCRACY IN THE THIRD WORLD 
  COUNTRIES:</span></b> </p>
  <p>In the present system of democratic system election to higher posts is a 
  costly affair. That indicates the first criteria to become elected is to have 
  affluence. And there is no hard and fast rule that intelligent, efficient, 
  honest and sympathetic person would be rich. Also no one should claim that a 
  rich man would have the quality and capability to lead a country. If a rich 
  man invests money for being elected, it is natural for him to make a big 
  profit out of his position. Needless to mention each such ‘profit’ is going to 
  cause heavy loss for the country. Now, say since a man willing to be elected 
  does not have the money and say, a rich man or company bears the cost of 
  election. What will be the outcome ? It will be worse because the elected 
  person will have to look at the interests of both. In the system of election 
  there is no provision for the state to assist efficient men in getting 
  elected. In such a context prevailing in the poor or third world countries no 
  one should expect Democracy to work. Well, one may trace ‘dishonesty of men’ 
  as one important cause also. In this case we observe, there was no provision 
  of creating good men in these countries.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">DEMOCRACY AND CAPITALISM:</span></b></p>
  <p>In spite of failure of democracy in the Socialist-communist countries one 
  must appreciate their endeavor, because of the fact that there was a sincere 
  attempt to eradicate the exploitable items from the hands of the probable 
  manipulators. It is pity that the capitalist countries could not still 
  understand the blunder in their system, they endeavor to call democracy. These 
  countries allegedly adopted democracy for political administration and 
  capitalism for economic development. In the capitalistic economy the 
  instruments of production are proposed to be in the hands of few, who could 
  make their best uses and the government is asked to patronize them in all 
  possible ways. Naturally, their economy suffers from a boom at the cost of the 
  suffering of the common people (because they are subjected to exploitation). 
  Even a school going boy may have the common sense that democracy or fair 
  election cannot in a situation where all the exploitable items are in the 
  hands of few. In addition the medias who play crucial role during election are 
  also owned by those manipulators. When the ‘guardians of capitalism’ rise to 
  power as a result of such ‘manipulated election’ whose interest would they 
  serve ? When several hundred millions of people fail to realize this simple 
  fact, we can guess the ‘brain-washing capability’ of their medias. I request 
  Prof. Sen to comment on whether or not democracy and capitalism can go 
  together. Whatever the experts under the influence of those brainwashing 
  elements might say, we know ‘capitalism reserves the inherent power to savor 
  the fruits of democracy’. That is why we see their there ‘democratically 
  elected government’ to waste people’s money in the name of (a) Self created 
  wars (Vietnam war, Iraq Kuwait war, Iraq war etc.), (b) Self created enemies 
  (best example, the Talibans), (c) Self created ego’s (for example, taking the 
  unnecessary responsibility of protecting Japan), (d) Self created trade loss 
  (example, trade imbalance with Japan) and so on.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">DEMOCRACY AND THE RELIGIOUS 
  COUNTRIES:</span></b></p>
  <p>Can democracy work in a religious country ? It depends largely upon the 
  nature of the religion. Democracy believes in equal rights for all, 
  irrespective of sex or religion. It is natural that in a mono-religious 
  country the government will follow the principles of that religion, because 
  that will be endorsed by the majority. Now the question is, does this religion 
  give equal rights to men and women ? Does it give equal status to men 
  belonging to any religion ? Or, whether it advocates killing of or conversion 
  of people from other religions ? ( It is not difficult to find it out. One may 
  just go through their authentic religious books). This is the reason why the 
  Muslim countries should not expect to have democracy till they can give it 
  higher position than their religion. Democracy cannot work in a country where 
  there are many religions with conflicting nature and where the people are 
  religious minded. In this case democracy might fail due to contradictions 
  between religious rules and democratic principles. Another important point to 
  note here is, the religions have failed to produce good-quality men.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">CONCLUSION:</span></b></p>
  <p>It has been proved beyond doubt that none of the poor, rich, capitalistic, 
  socialistic or religious countries in their present set ups can produce good 
  men, where as the first and foremost condition of success of democracy is 
  &quot;there must exist be good men in the country&quot;. By that consideration the 
  extent of democracy extends from mere fair election of representatives to 
  creation of good men. Religions have absolutely no hope of success in this age 
  of science and technology. It is a pity that they have no role to play in 
  democracy also. In this article I have endeavored to show what the men from 
  the eastern countries (who still boast of being away from the brain-washing 
  limit of the west) think about various aspects of democracy. We want to see, 
  how far Prof. Sen’s views differ from these. Since Prof. Sen is now above and 
  beyond the limits of blinding curtains, we believe he can easily express the 
  truth.</p>
