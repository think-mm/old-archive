  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">INTRODUCTION:</span></b></p>
  <p align="justify">I remember Prof. Amartya Kumar Sen once opined that he does 
  not believe in religion, but he respects those who work for the welfare of 
  human being even in the name of religion. I must say, this is one of the 
  truest and still noblest gestures towards religion. Whatever we expect to 
  accomplish, in case we expect to have the best we need good men. And the harsh 
  reality is, in this age the number of good men are on decrease. The eyes of 
  the westerners are blindfolded by wealth and they are increasing losing 
  interest in good men, noble character, morality and so on. If the trend 
  continues, a day would soon come when they would consider it profitable to 
  sell their young daughters to ‘bad quarters’ then to unnecessarily bear their 
  expenses. In spite of such non-scientific ideas people in the east love to 
  stay with religion for one strong reason, they dislike the western trend. For 
  centuries religion has been regarded as the subject dedicated to creation of 
  good men. However, the recent experiences, as revealed in the activities of 
  people belonging to certain religion have made people all over the globe 
  skeptical about the positive contribution of religion. Even though Prof. Sen 
  lived in the west for a long time there is no reason for him to know the 
  positive affects of religion, because he himself is an excellent product of 
  this religion. At the same time, in this age no enlightened man with common 
  sense can believe in such baseless ideas like ‘someone called created this 
  world, god would punish men for their deeds, god’s punishment can be averted 
  by financing the religious leaders’ etc. The most important question in this 
  juncture is, in absence of religion how would human society produce good men, 
  who are so essential for the peace and progress of this world, including 
  success of democracy.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">WHO CREATES GOOD 
  MEN ?</span></b></p>
  <b></b>
  <p align="justify">Two things which contribute to creation of good men are : 
  (a) Religion and (b) Literature. In this article we shall discuss religion 
  only. From the experience of the eastern countries we know, good men are the 
  products of religion. They teach their followers to love others, to be 
  sympathetic, to speak the truth, to speak honestly and so on. There are, 
  however, deviations in the later religions. In order to collect followers by 
  any means some of these religions even teach ‘killing people of other religion 
  is virtuous, snatching away wealth of men belonging to other religions and 
  surrendering certain percent is endorsed’ and so on. They even speak of 
  alluring things in the imaginary heaven. The affects of such preaching cannot 
  be good and the world is now witnessing the same. The common story behind 
  most, if not all, of the religions is : ‘God has created this world. He is 
  keenly observing our deeds. After death men would be rewarded for good acts 
  and punished for crimes in their after-lives after death. Even if one commits 
  mis-deeds he can avert punishment by gratifying the religious people’. The 
  major positive and negative contributions of religion may be summarized as (a) 
  Religion attaches various good qualities with the concept of god and by that 
  way endeavors to culture these qualities in men. For example, religion teaches 
  the children that god punishes those who speak lies and thus urges upon them 
  from telling lies. (b) Religion teaches un-scientific blind faiths that retard 
  development of scientific minds. (c) Some religions spread hatred against men 
  belonging to other religions or no-religion. (d) The alluring items promised 
  by some religions in the heaven make men greedy. (e) The concept that god’s 
  punishment can be averted by gratifying the religious organizations or leaders 
  encourages men to commit crimes. Some of the preaching of religion have been 
  formulated entirely for financial benefit. The preaching that punishment for 
  crime may be averted by gratification is one good example. The story that 
  someone called god has created this world is baseless and unscientific. This 
  is however preached with an explanation that the preacher in question is 
  either his relative or agent and can manage ‘his blessings’ in return of 
  money. Lastly, the attachment of good qualities with the concept of god does 
  not last in multi-religious or scientific societies. All these prove that in 
  this age, religion is not only useless, it is even harmful. Now think of the 
  vast properties now enjoyed by various religious organizations in the name of 
  ‘creating good men’. If one looks at their products one may be tempted that 
  this vast investment is another name for waste.</p>
  <p align="justify"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">&nbsp;SUBSTITUTE FOR 
  RELIGION :</span></b><tt><br>
&nbsp;</tt></p>
  <p align="justify">When considered on the basis of outcome, religion cannot be 
  considered as a subject to continue. Naturally, a scientifically advanced 
  country like USA has practically abandoned religion. But since they did not 
  provide any substitute arrangement for growth of good human qualities, they 
  are facing even harmful situations. It is possible they the citizens may not 
  understand the difference, because they are deeply immerged in a system and 
  their government, great men (most of these great men are puppets of the 
  capitalists) and the medias have successfully taught them to consider their 
  system to have been the best. But Prof. Sen has got the privilege of having a 
  neutral outlook. Even after being taught about numerous gods and their 
  miraculous activities since boyhood, Prof. Sen expressed his clear idea about 
  gods. The pragmatic persons must appreciate his courage and transparent 
  attitude. In such a context, it is high time for us to think of a substitute 
  for religion, or more precisely speaking ‘substitute for the positive 
  contributions of religion’. I would request Prof. Sen, who has such a 
  wonderful, excellent and transparent idea about religion, to think of a 
  substitute. This substitute must not allow the growth of any idle community 
  who loves to live on ‘believers money’ and this must be based on scientific 
  facts. All the good qualities that a society might think is essential for 
  maintaining peace, progress and harmony will be included in this subject. 
  Naturally this subject will vary from one country to another. The subject will 
  be called ‘Ethics’. It will be taught as compulsory subject in schools, 
  colleges and universities. In it the students will be taught that they must 
  speak the truth, act honestly, behave correctly because ‘he is a man’ and 
  because ‘those ensure peace and happiness in the society’. There will be no 
  concept of punishment or reward after death, but the society will look that 
  the moral qualities are followed in the society. Whenever there is a deviation 
  the society will enforce its measures.<b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">DEMOCRACY AND 
  RELIGION:</span></p>
  <font face="Arial" size="2"><font face="Arial">
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</font></font></b>We have already mentioned elsewhere 
  why democracy cannot work in a religious country. When looked in further 
  details one may see democracy cannot work in a country with many religions of 
  conflicting nature. What happens in case of mono-religious countries ? 
  Democracy believes in equal rights for all irrespective of sex or religion. 
  Since this country is religious it would be the obligation of their government 
  to follow the principles of that religion. Does this particular religion give 
  equal rights to men and women belonging to other religions ? Or, it advocates 
  killing or conversion of people of other religions ? It may now be easy to 
  understand why the Muslim countries cannot expect to see the fair-play of 
  democracy.</p>
  <p align="justify">Still today we have not seen any religion that allows the 
  basic requirement of democracy which is equal status for all men. Without a 
  single exception the religions advocate their followers to have been the best. 
  In case the introduction of ethics as a subject of knowledge be introduced in 
  the educational institutions and the society with its administration and 
  legislation come forward to maintain the ethical qualities, religion will 
  practically be redundant. In such case all the establishments now being 
  enjoyed by the religious organizations may be brought under the government and 
  be used for ‘culture of democracy’. In another article we have mentioned that 
  in order to find success democracy must not be kept limited in periodical 
  elections only, but be cultured throughout the year.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <b>
  <p align="justify"><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">CONCLUSION :</span></p>
  </b>
  <p align="justify">Men, who have born in this world would live for a period of 
  say fifty to eighty years. They have born with equal rights on the wealth of 
  this world. The term ‘equal’ however has to be taken only loosely. The complex 
  economic principles, political administrations and other systems through which 
  we are now going cannot ensure ‘equal’ opportunities for all. And there is no 
  need for it even, because a considerable section of men are not that greedy to 
  claim their full share. It is the noble duty of the ruling government that 
  each citizen are provided with the basic necessities. Democracy should fix 
  this aim as the prime target But we know, ensuring this condition will not 
  bring peace in the society. For that purpose we would need good men. Religions 
  have proved, they have failed in that venture. In this article we have 
  proposed ‘ethics’ as its substitute. Prof. Amartya Sen, our pride may think of 
  a much better substitute. Professor Sen’s greatness has already been proved in 
  the west. We are hopeful he would come forward to prove his greatness in the 
  east, among his countrymen through his concern and works for these poor souls.</p>
