  all the meteors vanish in the sky. Some can manage to reach the earth. If 
  those are of minute size one may not be able to detect those. But the remains 
  of some meteors are quite large and capable of bringing profuse changes. Along

  poets have eyes, differing from those of the common people. The 
  biologist/botanist know flower as the genital mechanism of plants. For the 
  poets, however, flowers are gifts from the heaven. In case our Nobel laureate 
  poet could see the two meteors in two different lands today, he would have 
  seen those differently. Be they curse or blessing they belong to one common 
  class, the meteor. Our poet probably could see them as “Socialism”, because 
  socialism also played such dual roles. Like these meteors, socialism also 
  vanished, but not without remains. Various countries still enjoy or suffer 
  from its remains in various magnitudes.&nbsp; The poet opined, “It sparked, it flew 
  and got lost, that was its great delight.” In case of Socialism the poet’s 
  observation could have been “It appeared, it burnt houses and fried meats, and 
  then it disappeared”. Those whose house were burnt still curse it with filthy 
  words. Strangely, those whose ‘meat’ it fried, do relish the roasted meat. But 
  do they really know, why and how they were rewarded with these benefits ?

  Capitalization is an old concept. From time immemorial the experts advised for 
  ‘capitalization of a single item’ as the surest key to success. Suppose a man 
  is taking a program to achieve top level successes in the fields A, B, C and 
  D, second level successes in E, F, G and H and so on. When the resources are 
  limited and situations are not in full control, it is quite doubtful if the 
  man would at all success in his program. But if he stresses upon one and only 
  one item, say A, there is wide possibility that he would come out successful. 
  This is capitalization. In the above program, say&nbsp; the man is after 
  capitalization in only one field ‘A’. It is obvious that he would succeed, of 
  course at the cost of other fields, viz. B, C, D, E, F, G etc. ‘Specialist 
  professionals’ have capitalized on only one item, where as the ‘generalists’ 
  have done the same on many.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>

  aware, the rich won’t like to lose their interest. So, they thought of 
  motivating the people whose interest this system would serve. These people are 
  the laborers of production houses and agricultural growth-farms. They thought 
  of ‘strong communes’ of the working people. They also thought of the process 
  in which the working people could form communes and the communes could grab 
  state power. Thus, where ‘socialism’ remained as the objective, they planned 
  for the ‘rule of the communes’. For the time being their&nbsp; process of achieving 
  the target turned to ‘Communism’. </span></font></p>

  of all was a chairman. Once elected, he would in fact held ‘dictatorial power’ 
  for certain period of time. (In the presidential form of democracy in the US, 
  the president also have similar power). They observed, if such a party can 
  grab the power, they would run the bureaucracy with the help of the 
  representatives of the communes. They observed, it sounded like 
  ‘dictatorship’. They honestly named it ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’, 
  where proletariat means ‘the working people’. They targeted for improving 
  democracy and now they ended up with a dictatorial system. However, they had

  have any sympathy for communism. In course of their invading program to 
  liberate countries from the grip of some tyrant dictators, a few ‘generals’ 
  all on a sudden discovered, vast land was under their authority. They could 
  not think of following the path of the previous administrators, because they 
  wanted to avoid being called “neo-dictators”. So, their problem was, they 
  wanted to be dictators but wanted to be known by some honorable&nbsp; name. At this 
  state, they pleasure-fully discovered, in Socialism/Communism there is a post 
  of&nbsp; ‘party-chairman’, who by all means could act as dictator. It is no wonder 
  that they immediately accepted Communism. Even though communism advocated for 
  experienced organizers and party workers to held important posts, now 
  ex-generals were in those posts. The administration, however, was quite 
  efficient because it was formed with the experience of ‘military
