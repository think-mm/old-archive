  REMEMBERING OUR ANCESTORS : WHY AND HOW ? </span></font></b></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana">INTRODUCTION : Have anybody ever seen an animal to do 
  something to indicate ‘the animals endeavour to remember its ancestor ?’ In 
  the animal world parents or better ‘pairs’ are seen as instrument for 
  breeding. Even though initiated exactly with ‘animal-like culture’, men later 
  deviated and developed a very different type of culture. The human culture 
  differs from that of the animals in numerous aspects. Some of these are : (a) 
  Marriage, (b) Taking care of the elders, (c) Cumulative storing of knowledge 
  and experience, (d) Aspiration to be better, (e) Endeavouring to remember the 
  ancestors etc. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">From time immemorial men have endeavoured to remember 
  their ancestors. In the ancient world large Pyramids, mummies, shrines etc. 
  were developed to achieve this goal. In the contemporary society grave, tomb, 
  mausoleum etc. serve the same purpose. However, as days are going on people 
  are increasingly facing problems to remember their ancestors. This article 
  would discuss among others, the ‘why and how’ to remember the ancestors.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">CULTURE OF MAN AND ANIMAL : We shall present a brief 
  discussion of a few special characteristics of the human culture, like (a) 
  Marriage, (b) Taking care of the elders, (c) Aspiration to be better etc.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">MARRIAGE is characterized by the following factors : (i) 
  Consent to marriage by the concerned man and woman. (ii) Oath by the two in 
  front of distinguished people including parents. (iii) Some sort of written 
  documents to this effect. The ‘ideal marriage’ means, marriage between two 
  unmarried man and woman without no prior sex-experience. The relation is to 
  stay for a period till death. Such marriage may be seceded by mutual consent 
  and a re-marriage may be arranged. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">The various countries and communities, however, have 
  changed the ‘ideal marriage’ as per their convenience and wish. Thus some 
  communities advocates numerous wives for one man, some maximum four wives per 
  man, some prescribe quickest cessation by uttering few words and so on. There 
  have been changes in the premarital requirements also. In order to stop 
  probable agitation of the young people some countries have endorsed or rather 
  encouraged pre-marital sex or open sex. Experiences (and statistics) reveal, 
  countries with open sex have less violence among the young generations in 
  comparison to those where such act is prohibited. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">In some countries the political parties have meant 
  ‘Democracy’ synonymous to ‘Freedom of men’. As an interpretation of the same 
  they have allowed, introduced and encouraged acts like adultery, living 
  together, same sex marriage etc. in the society. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">(b) TAKING CARE OF THE ELDERS : In the animal world, 
  the mother and at time the pair take care of the offspring. In human culture, 
  as additional duty the children take care of the parents and relatives in 
  their old age. Some countries however, have relieved the children from this 
  moral duty. Such a system has been a matter of pleasure for the young 
  generation. It has also created fortune for the manufacturers by creating 
  fresh demands for house, furniture, consumer items etc. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">(c) ASPIRATION TO BE BETTER : Because of their 
  difference from the animals in points of thinking ability, men in general 
  aspire to be better. They also expect the same for their offspring. For this 
  purpose they store their knowledge in written form in libraries. In the 
  societies where the parents live with the children, the parents endeavour to 
  transmit their life-long experience to the children. In societies where this 
  tradition is absent, the experience of the matured parents cannot reach the 
  children and the political parties or medias fill the vacuum. They teach the 
  young generation whatever they think proper or whatever serves their purposes. 
  “A man who strives to live in this earth for his own sake only” is an 
  extremely dangerous person. Such a man can do anything good, bad, extreme or 
  heinous, because he does not care for what others might think of him, and 
  because he has no responsibility to anyone other than him. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">WHY TO REMEMBER ? Men in different communities have 
  different notions about the deceased relatives. The Buddhists think, the 
  deceased men take re-birth to take punishment or reward. The Muslims and the 
  Christians think, men would take re-birth on the final day of judgement. The 
  Hindus think, after death what would enjoy the punishment or reward is man’s 
  spirit (or ‘Atma’, a fictitious thing). They arrange cremation and rituals 
  through graves, coffining, burning etc. In this age of science we know, there 
  is no god or after world and there cannot be any case of rebirth. Each and 
  everything relating to a man comes to an end with his death. Remembering the 
  dead relatives, showing honour or weeping for them matters nothing to them. 
  The same however, matters much for those who witness such acts. They instantly 
  feel what it is meant by “a good man”. When a man finds the children of a 
  deceased man to remember their ancestors with honour, their neighbours to weep 
  to remember his good deeds, there is a possibility that this man also would be 
  inspired to do good deeds, such that his descendants might remember him in the 
  similar way. This is the reason why we should remember our ancestors. Such 
  acts do not go in the interest of the dead men, but for the living ones.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">HOW TO REMEMBER ? In the Eastern and Middle Eastern 
  countries there are endeavours to remember the dead persons by constructing 
  structures (tomb or mausoleum) over the grave or burning site. This scope is 
  limited only to the affluent class. Whatever strong the structure might be, it 
  has limited life. And what is more true is, in view of the ever-increasing 
  cost of land it is doubtful how long such tombs or mausoleums can be 
  maintained. On the other hand, all men, irrespective of affluence or other 
  statuses want to me remembered by the descendants. In such a context, I shall 
  present here a proposal for consideration of all, specially the people’s 
  representatives and mayors of the cities. In addition to keeping the dead 
  persons in the memories of their relatives and neighbours this proposal also 
  incorporates tools that may be of help in creating better quality men. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">PROPOSAL : (i) The walls of the premises of the 
  people’s representatives (in case of Bangladesh Mayor, Ward commissioner, 
  Chairman etc.), public parks etc. would be used to display the names and brief 
  information of the diseased person living in that area. The walls will be 
  prepared for placing small stone tablets (say, size 1 Ft X 1.5 Ft.). Each 
  tablet would contain the name of the deceased person, his/her educational 
  qualification, parents’ names, names of children (maximum three elders), date 
  of birth and date of expiry and a code number. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">(ii) A room in the adjacent office (in case of park a 
  building may have to be constructed) will contain small lockers (say, size 1 
  Ft X 1 Ft X 1.5 Ft) with code number. Each of the locker will be designated to 
  the stone tablet with the corresponding number. The locker would contain 
  detail curriculum vitae, writings, wills, ashes (where applicable) 
  information, photographs, used artefacts etc. of the dead person, as supplied 
  by his relatives. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">(iii) A room of space in the adjacent area shall be 
  arranged, such that the relatives or neighbours of the dead person can arrange 
  memorial service as per prior arrangement and on payment of cost. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">(iv) The basic structure for this project would be 
  constructed by the city or urban authorities as a sign of their kind gesture 
  to the citizens. Affluent persons would be charged two to five times of the 
  actual cost. The excess amount would be deposited in a bank account and shall 
  be utilised for the poor persons. The areas with stone tablets would remain 
  open for most of the hours of the day for all to visit. The relatives and 
  friends would be permitted to see the documents on payment of nominal fee.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">(v) The tablets and documents will be preserved for a 
  certain period time (say, fifty years), after which those shall be preserved 
  in the achieve, unless the relatives wish else way and bear further the cost.
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">(vi) The local authorities would prepare their own 
  rules and regulations regarding the criteria of persons be entertained. Thus, 
  persons with any criminal record should not be entertained. Persons having 
  bachelor degree and above should be given a special place, where as those 
  below this level should be treated as commoners. The names of only three 
  children of the deceased person may be recorded. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana">CONCLUSION : In a democratic country the citizens own 
  the country they serve. Naturally, such a relation places upon the country 
  certain responsibility towards the citizens and keeping the member in memory 
  of the city in one of them. The recent changes like non-availability of land, 
  high cost of construction, children’s inability to bear the cost etc. have 
  made it increasingly difficult to keep the deceased persons in memory for a 
  longer time. In such a context the democratic governments should come forward 
  to materialize this noble mission. If this project is realized, there are 
  possibilities that it might inspire the citizens to become interested in 
  education, non-interested in crime, attracted to family planning and to work 
  in a manner such that the future generations might show honour to them after 
  they are gone. </font></p>
