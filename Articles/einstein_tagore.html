	<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
	<p><b>TAGORE: </b>You have been busy, hunting down with mathematics, the two 
ancient entities, time and space, while I have been lecturing in this country on 
the eternal world of man, the universe of reality.</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN:</b>&nbsp; Do you believe in the divine isolated from the world?</p>
<p><b>TAGORE:</b>&nbsp; Not isolated. The infinite personality of man comprehends the 
universe. There cannot be anything that cannot be subsumed by the human 
personality, and this proves that the truth of the universe is human truth.</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN:</b> There are two different conceptions about the nature of the 
universe - the world as a unity dependent on humanity, and the world as reality 
independent of the human factor.</p>
<p><b>TAGORE:</b> When our universe is in harmony with man, the eternal, we know 
it as truth, we feel it as beauty.</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN: </b>This is a purely human conception of the universe.</p>
<p><b>TAGORE</b>:&nbsp; ThE world is a human world - the scientific view of it is 
also that of the scientific man. Therefore, the world apart from us does not 
exist; it is a relative world, depending for its reality upon our consciousness. 
There is some standard of reason and enjoyment which gives it truth, the 
standard of the eternal man whose experiences are made possible through our 
experiences.</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN: </b>This is a realization of the human entity.</p>
<p><b>TAGORE:</b>&nbsp; Yes, one eternal entity. We have to realize it through our 
emotions and activities. We realize the supreme man, who has no individuaL 
limitations, through our limitations.</p>
<p>Science is concerned with that which is not confined to individuals; it is 
the impersonal human world of truths. Religion realizes these truths and links 
them up with our deeper needs. Our individual consciousness of truth gains 
universal significance. Religion applies values to truth, and we know truth as 
good through own harmony with it. EINSTEIN Truth, then, or beauty, is not 
independent of man?</p>
<p><b>TAGORE: </b>No, I do not say so.</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN:</b>&nbsp; If there were no human beings any more, the Apollo 
Belvedere no longer would be beautiful?</p>
<p><b>TAGORE:</b>&nbsp; No!</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN:</b>&nbsp; I agree with this conception of beauty, but not with regard 
to truth. </p>
<p><b>TAGORE</b> Why not? Truth is realized through men. </p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN</b> I cannot prove my conception is right, but that is my 
religion. </p>
<p><b>TAGORE</b> Beauty is in the ideal of perfect harmony, which is in the 
universal being; truth is the perfect comprehension of the universal mind. We 
individuals approach it through our own mistakes and blunders, through our 
accumulated experience, through our illumined consciousness. How otherwise can 
we know truth?</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN:</b> I cannot prove, but I believe in the Pythagorean argument, 
that the truth is independent of human beings. It is the problem of the logic of 
continuity.</p>
<p><b>TAGORE :</b> Truth, which is one with the universal being, must be 
essentially human; otherwise, whatever we individuals realize as true, never can 
be called truth. At least, the truth which is described as scientific and which 
only can be reached through the process of logic - —in other words, by an organ 
of thought which is human. According to the Indian philosophy there is Brahman, 
the absolute truth, which cannot be conceived by the isolation of the individual 
mind or described by words, but can be realized only by merging the individual 
in its infinity. But such a truth cannot belong to science. The nature of truth 
which we are discussing is an appearance; that is to say, what appears to be 
true to the human mind, and therefore is human, and may be called maya, or 
illusion. </p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN</b> It is no illusion of the individual, but of the species.</p>
<p><b>TAGORE: </b>The species also belongs to a unity, to humanity. Therefore 
the entire human mind realizes truth; the Indian and the European mind meet in a 
common realization.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN: </b>The word species is used in German for all human beings; as 
a matter of fact, even the apes and the frogs would belong to it. The problem is 
whether truth is independent of our consciousness.</p>
<p><b>TAGORE:</b>&nbsp; What we call truth lies in the rational harmony between the 
subjective and objective aspects of reality, both of which belong to the 
superpersonal man.</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN: </b>We do things with our mind, even in our everyday life, for 
which we are not responsible. The mind acknowledges realities outside of it, 
independent of it. For instance, nobody may be in this house, yet that table 
remains where it is.</p>
<p><b>TAGORE: </b>Yes, it remains outside the individual mind, but not the 
universal mind. The table is that which is perceptible by some kind of 
consciousness we possess.</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN: </b>If nobody were in the house the table would exist all the 
same, but this is already illegitimate from your point of view, because we 
cannot explain what it means, that the table is there, independently of us. Our 
natural point of view in regard to the existence of truth apart from humanity 
cannot be explained or proved, but it is a belief which nobody can lack - —not 
even primitive beings. We attribute to truth a superhuman objectivity. It is 
indispensable for us - —this reality which is independent of our existence and 
our experience and our mind - though we cannot say what it means.</p>
<p><b>TAGORE:</b>&nbsp; In any case, if there be any truth absolutely unrelated to 
humanity, then for us it is absolutely non-existing.</p>
<p><b>EINSTEIN:&nbsp; </b>Then I am more religious than you are!</p>
<p><b>TAGORE: </b>My religion is in the reconciliation of the superpersonal man, 
the universal spirit, in my own individual being.</p>

MODERN PHYSICS, MUSIC ETC.</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><i><b>Excerpted from &quot;Three conversations: Tagore Talks 
with Einstein, with Rolland, and Wells&quot;&nbsp; (ASIA 3/1931, p.139-143,196 f.)</b></i></font></p>
	<p><b>TAGORE</b>: I was discussing with Dr. Mendel today the new mathematical 
discoveries which tell us that in the realm of infinitesimal atoms chance has 
its play; the drama of existence is not absolutely predestined in character.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: The facts that make science tend toward this view do not say 
good-bye to causality.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Maybe not, yet it appears that the idea of causality is not in 
the elements, but that some other force builds up with them an organized 
universe.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: One tries to understand in the higher plane how the order is. 
The order is there, where the big elements combine and guide existence, but in 
the minute elements this order is not perceptible.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Thus duality is in the depths of existence, the contradiction of 
free impulse and the directive will which works upon it and evolves an orderly 
scheme of things.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: Modern physics would not say they are contradictory. Clouds 
look as one from a distance, but if you see them nearby, they show themselves as 
disorderly drops of water.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: I find a parallel in human psychology. Our passions and desires 
are unruly, but our character subdues these elements into a harmonious whole. 
Does something similar to this happen in the physical world? Are the elements 
rebellious, dynamic with individual impulse? And is there a principle in the 
physical world which dominates them and puts them into an orderly organization?<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: Even the elements are not without statistical order; elements 
of radium will always maintain their specific order, now and ever onward, just 
as they have done all along. There is, then, a statistical order in the 
elements.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Otherwise, the drama of existence would be too desultory. It is 
the constant harmony of chance and determination which makes it eternally new 
and living.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: I believe that whatever we do or live for has its causality; it 
is good, however, that we cannot see through to it.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: There is in human affairs an element of elasticity also, some 
freedom within a small range which is for the expression of our personality. It 
is like the musical 
system in India, which is not so rigidly fixed as western music. Our 
composers give a certain definite outline, a system of melody and rhythmic 
arrangement, and within a certain limit the player can improvise upon it. He 
must be one with the law of that particular melody, and then he can give 
spontaneous expression to his musical feeling within the prescribed regulation. 
We praise the composer for his genius in creating a foundation along with a 
superstructure of melodies, but we expect from the player his own skill in the 
creation of variations of melodic flourish and ornamentation. In creation we 
follow the central law of existence, but if we do not cut ourselves adrift from 
it, we can have sufficient freedom within the limits of our personality for the 
fullest self-expression.</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Pic: Tagore and Einstien : A 
memorable moment. (<i>Courtesy : Ms. Sabina Chowdhury</i>) </b></font></p>
	<p><br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: That is possible only when there is a strong artistic tradition 
in music to guide the people's mind. In Europe, music has come too far away from 
popular art and popular feeling and has become something like a secret art with 
conventions and traditions of its own.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: You have to be absolutely obedient to this too complicated music. 
In India, the measure of a singer's freedom is in his own creative personality. 
He can sing the composer's song as his own, if he has the power creatively to 
assert himself in his interpretation of the general law of the melody which he 
is given to interpret.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: It requires a very high standard of art to realize fully the 
great idea in the original music, so that one can make variations upon it. In 
our country, the variations are often prescribed.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: If in our conduct we can follow the law of goodness, we can have 
real liberty of self-expression. The principle of conduct is there, but the 
character which makes it true and individual is our own creation. In our music 
there is a duality of freedom and prescribed order.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: Are the words of a song also free? I mean to say, is the singer 
at liberty to add his own words to the song which he is singing?<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Yes. In 
Bengal we have a kind of song-<i>kirtan</i>, we call it-which gives freedom 
to the singer to introduce parenthetical comments, phrases not in the original 
song. This occasions great enthusiasm, since the audience is constantly thrilled 
by some beautiful, spontaneous sentiment added by the singer.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: Is the metrical form quite severe?<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Yes, quite. You cannot exceed the limits of versification; the 
singer in all his variations must keep the rhythm and the time, which is fixed. 
In European music you have a comparative liberty with time, but not with melody.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: Can the Indian music be sung without words? Can one understand 
a song without words?<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Yes, we have songs with unmeaning words, sounds which just help 
to act as carriers of the notes. In North India, music is an independent art, 
not the interpretation of words and thoughts, as in Bengal. The music is very 
intricate and subtle and is a complete world of melody by itself.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: Is it not polyphonic?<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Instruments are used, not for harmony, but for keeping time and 
adding to the volume and depth. Has melody suffered in your music by the 
imposition of harmony?<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: Sometimes it does suffer very much. Sometimes the harmony 
swallows up the melody altogether.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Melody and harmony are like lines and colors in pictures. A 
simple linear picture may be completely beautiful; the introduction of color may 
make it vague and insignificant. Yet color may, by combination with lines, 
create great pictures, so long as it does not smother and destroy their value.
<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: It is a beautiful comparison; line is also much older than 
color. It seems that your melody is much richer in structure than ours. Japanese 
music also seems to be so.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: It is difficult to analyze the effect of eastern and western 
music on our minds. I am deeply moved by the western music; I feel that it is 
great, that it is vast in its structure and grand in its composition. Our own 
music touches me more deeply by its fundamental lyrical appeal. European music 
is epic in character; it has a broad background and is Gothic in its structure.
<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: This is a question we Europeans cannot properly answer, we are 
so used to our own music. We want to know whether our own music is a 
conventional or a fundamental human feeling, whether to feel consonance and 
dissonance is natural, or a convention which we accept.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Somehow the piano confounds me. The violin pleases me much more.
<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: It would be interesting to study the effects of European music 
on an Indian who had never heard it when he was young.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Once I asked an English musician to analyze for me some classical 
music, and explain to me what elements make for the beauty of the piece.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: The difficulty is that the really good music, whether of the 
East or of the West, cannot be analyzed.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: Yes, and what deeply affects the hearer is beyond himself.<br>
<b>EINSTEIN</b>: The same uncertainty will always be there about everything 
fundamental in our experience, in our reaction to art, whether in Europe or in 
Asia. Even the red flower I see before me on your table may not be the same to 
you and me.<br>
<b>TAGORE</b>: And yet there is always going on the process of reconciliation 
between them, the individual taste conforming to the universal standard. </p>

comment:</span></font></b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font color="#0000cd">The question of meaning of reality was the central 
	subject of a fascinating dialog between Einstein and Tagore. Einstein 
	emphasized that the science had to be independent of the existence of any 
	observer. This led him to deny the reality of time as irreversibility, as 
	evolution.&nbsp; On the contrary Tagore maintained that even if absolute 
	truth could exist, it would be inaccessible to the human mind. Curiously 
	enough, the present evolution of science is running in the direction stated 
	by great poet.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

COMMENT ON TAGORE'S MYSTICISM:</font></b></p>
<p>Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970), the great philosopher of the modern era, 
wrote after hearing Thakur's lecture on 'The realisation of Brahma':</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font color="#0000cd">Here I am back from Tagore's lecture, after walking 
	most of the way home. It was unmitigated rubbish- cut-and- dried 
	conventional stuff about the river becoming one with the Ocean and man 
	becoming one with Brahma. The man is sincere and in earnest but merely 
	rattling old dry bones. I spoke to him before the lecture afterwards I 
	avoided him.'</font></p>
	<p><font color="#0000cd">Russell had more such strong and strenuous 
	commentson Thakur and as quoted recently in the work of Krishna Dutta and 
	Andrew Robinson:</font></p>
	<p><font color="#0000cd">'I regret I can not agree with Tagore. His talk 
	about the infinite is vague nonsense. The sort of language that is admired 
	by many Indians unfortunately does not, in fact, mean any thing at all.'</font></p>

	<p><font color="#0000cd">Dear Mr Russell</font></p>
	<p><font color="#0000cd">Thanks for your kind letter. I will ask Dr Seal to 
	pay you a visit at Cambridge, when you will have an opportunity to know him. 
	I read your article on the Essence of Religion in the last issue of the

	baffled. Yet he who knows the joy of Brahman (the Infinite) is free from all

	<p><font color="#0000cd">Through knowledge you cannot apprehend him; yet 
	when you live the life of the Infinite and are not bound within the limits 
	of the finite self you realize that great joy which is above all the 
	pleasures and pains of our selfish life and so you are free from all fear.</font></p>
	<p><font color="#0000cd">This joy itself is the positive perception of 
	Brahman. It is not a greed which authority imposes on us but an absolute 
	realization of the Infinite which we can only attain by breaking through the 
	bonds of the narrow self and setting our will and love free.</font></p>
