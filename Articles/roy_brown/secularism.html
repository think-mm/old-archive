	I have been reading with interest the <a href="../avijit/secularism_MM.html">
	debate on your website about the meaning of the word Secularism</a>. The 
	problem is that the word has come to have two distinct meanings: as the 
	basis for state neutrality in matters of religion, and as the basis for a 
	society free from religion (synonymous with Atheism).</font></h1>

	<h1 align="center" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.3pt">
	<font size="3" color="#000080">In the United Kingdom, the National Secular 
	Society tries to encompass both meanings but, in my view, with limited 
	success, having become identified as the voice of Atheism in the public 
	arena. The response of the Vatican to the &quot;threat&quot; of Secularism - and it 
	was one of the first statements to emanate fro the new pope - has been to 
	demonize all secularism as anti-religious. Yet it is well known that the 
	first enemy of any religion is not Secularism but every other religion. Most 
	secularists and humanists believe strongly in freedom of religion and belief 
	as long as religion remains a private matter. The tragedy of modern society 
	is that for many religious people there is only one true religion - theirs ( 
	whichever religion it may happen to be) - and they want to see it imposed on 
	the whole of society. </font></h1>

	</b>As a Humanist, I have a duty of respect to every individual - to their 
	privacy, dignity and autonomy, regardless of their religion - because we all 
	share our common humanity. <b>But</b> <b>how can I respect any religion that

	does nevertheless safeguard the most important human freedom.&nbsp; State 
	neutrality if properly applied would, for example, prevent funding of any 
	faith-based initiative or support for any religious activity that was not 
	also extended equally to non-religious groups. We heard from Lars Gule at

	from imposing its worldview on the rest of society. The secular safeguards 
	must therefore be not merely legal, but constitutional. A law lacking 
	constitutional safeguards could easily be overturned by a simple majority in 
	the legislature.</span></font></p>

	industry in particular. In reality his targets were all and any liberals who 
	attempted to defend freedom of conscience or freedom of speech. His methods 
	were those of the typical demagogue: any one who opposed him was by 
	definition guilty of “un-American” activities. Hundreds of lives and 
	livelihoods were ruined, and today, 50 years later, the smell still lingers 
	on and liberal bashing has become even more overt. To be deemed a liberal is 
	to be doomed to failure in public life. To be deemed a <i>Secular Humanist</i>

	One Nation Under God</i>, the pressure on the Constitution has been 
	mounting. <i>E Pluribus Unum</i> accurately represented the America of 
	immigration and immigrant communities. From wherever they came, they all 
	became Americans. The melting pot was a wonderful metaphor for that America. 
	But today we have a new America. The risk with any melting pot is that the 
	scum will rise to the top. Today’s America is a tyranny; a tyranny of
