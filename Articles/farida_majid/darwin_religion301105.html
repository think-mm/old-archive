	Kennedy echoed my sentiments when he expressed annoyance and ennui at the 
	Islam-bashing group. Pointing to their abysmal lack of knowledge of anything 
	and their incompetence, towards the end of his piece he encouraged them to

	Mr. Kennedy, but it is useless to suggest any educational improvement to 
	this closed-minded lot. No good counsel can put a damper in this group’s 
	campaign of self-aggrandizement. In their Talibanite fervor they religiously 
	refuse to read any book other than the Qur’an and Hadith. They should verily 
	be called “The Qur’an-Hadithwallas.” Never did I believe in my wildest 
	imagination that I would have the misfortune of falling into such an 
	aggressive bunch of people who call themselves “secular” and read nothing 
	but Islamic religious scripts, and write, in atrocious English, endlessly on

	they think that Darwin must have been an atheist. How could he have come up 
	with the theory of evolution otherwise? Exactly in the manner of the

	fluent prose, his wonderfully agile and probing mind, his life and his 
	personality. Although I had only skimmed the <i>Origin of Species</i> before 
	1972, it was the year that I bought myself a copy of <i>Darwin and the 
	Beagle</i> (Penguin Books, 1971) by Alan Moorehead, the famed author of <i>
	The White Nile</i> (1960) and <i>The Blue Nile</i> (1962).&nbsp; Moorehead’s 
	book, though meticulously researched, is written in easy narrative style for 
	a general audience, and the Penguin edition is magnificently illustrated by 
	paintings, drawings and sketches made by artists who, in lieu of latter-day 
	photographers, accompanied Darwin in this expedition in 1831-36. It is one 
	of the most prized books in my possession and to which I love to return from 
	time to time for inner inspiration. Our Qur’an-Hadithwallas would not

	bubbling with enthusiasm at the offer of the post of a naturalist on the 
	long voyage round the world.&nbsp; He had just graduated from Cambridge 
	University’s Christ’s Church, and was about to enter the Church as a country 
	parson when this astonishing offer came to him through the recommendation of 
	his Professor of Botany, John Stevens Henslow, himself a clergyman.</span></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 
	September 5, 1831, Darwin was summoned to London to meet Robert FitzRoy, the 
	aristocratic captain of HMS <i>Beagle</i>, a small but very well outfitted 
	ship with a splendid, experienced crew. The two young men got along famously 
	at that meeting, and thus, despite youth, inexperience, and against all 
	odds, Darwin embarked on the greatest adventure of his life – the voyage of 
	the <i>Beagle</i>. It was the voyage, Moorehead reminds us, “that became, as 
	it were, the origin of the Origin of Species, and the basis of those ideas 
	which have since changed all our lives.”</span></font></p>

	this expedition with two missions: first to continue the charting of South 
	American coast, and secondly to get a more accurate fixing of longitude. But 
	there was another unstated mission. Robert FitzRoy was a deeply religious 
	man who believed every word in the Bible absolutely. It was not unusual to 
	take a naturalist on board a voyage such as this, but FitzRoy had a special 
	object in view, a religious object.</font></p>

	many evidences of the Flood and the first appearance of all created things 
	upon the earth.&nbsp; He could perform a valuable service by interpreting his 
	scientific discoveries in the light of the Bible. Darwin, the young 
	clergyman-to-be, was very ready to agree.&nbsp; He too, did not in the least 
	doubt the literal truth of every word in the Bible at this time – it was 
	part of the world he accepted and liked so well – and if he could be of use 
	in this way, well then, that made the prospect of the voyage all the more 
	exciting” (25).</span></span></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darwin was fortunate also in his family 
	background. His father, Robert, was a doctor and made a small fortune in 
	Shrewsbury, and grandfather Dr. Erasmus Darwin made a great name both as a 
	doctor and as a writer of verse with scientific and evolutionist themes. 
	Darwin later denied that he was influenced by any of his grandfather’s poems 
	in any way. His mother was aWedgwood, the famous family of potters, and he 
	married his first cousin Emma, the daughter of Sir Josiah Wedgwood, his 
	maternal uncle. Charles and Emma had ten children, seven of whom survived, 
	and they lived a genuinely happy family life. The Darwins, in other words, 
	were upper class Whigs and Liberals, very different than the aristocratic, 
	rigid and conservative Tory background of FitzRoy, the captain of the <i>
	Beagle</i>.</font></p>

	appreciate the full extent of Darwin’s achievement and his good sense and 
	indomitable courage, we should try to get an idea what “creationism” 
	consisted of in Victorian England. It was markedly different than the 
	post-Darwin creationism, about which I will have to say more later.&nbsp; By a 
	series of mystical calculations and computations, Archbishop Ussher and Dr. 
	John Lightfoot of Cambridge University had fixed the actual date of the 
	creation of the world – it was 9 am on Sunday, 23 October in 4004
	<span style="font-variant:small-caps">b.c.</span> – and this extraordinary 
	pronouncement was printed with all the authority of the Gospel itself in 
	many copies of the Bible that were in circulation at the time.&nbsp; There may 
	have been theological arguments about the interpretation of the facts; but 
	the facts of the Bible were sacrosanct: the world had been created in six 
	days, man was made in His image, all the creatures of earth had sprung into 
	existence at the same instant, and they all survived the Great Flood because 
	Noah had taken two of each species, one male and one female, aboard his 
	Ark.&nbsp; In those days such beliefs were at the heart of nearly everyone’s 
	consciousness. If you took away those beliefs, you could shake the very 
	foundation, destroy the society, and mock God Himself! This was unthinkable!</span></font></p>

text-indent:36.0pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Darwin 
	had to be extremely cautious.&nbsp; I admire the manner in which he exercised 
	caution and his consideration for people’s preparedness to receive his 
	ideas. Would that our Qur’an-Hadithwalla “secularists” had the sense to 
	emulate Darwin’s civility. Ever since his return from the voyage, Darwin had 
	been busy writing up, editing, and revising the materials gathered from the 
	long trip. Full ten years’ labor was exerted to edit five volumes of <i>
	Zoology of the Beagle</i>, after that, there was <i>Geology of the Voyage of 
	the Beagle</i> in several parts. His <i>Journal</i> when it came out in 
	1839, apart from its scientific value, was regarded as one of the best books 
	of travel and adventure ever written. It was translated and published all 
	over the world. But Darwin delayed, and waited for more than twenty-three 
	years before publishing his heretical theories on the origin of the teeming 
	species on earth. In my opinion, he delayed, not because he might face 
	ostracism in England, and on the Continent he might easily have been 
	arrested and tried at some Inquisition-like court, but because he did not 
	want his beautiful scientific discovery to be ridiculed, degraded and 
	discarded by the world.</span></font></p>

text-indent:36.0pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Here, I 
	have to draw the attention of all our Islam-bashing so-called secularists to 
	the fact that persecution of heretics is extremely rare in Islamic history 
	and civilization. Islam expressly forbids a clergy, and unlike Catholicism 
	or the Church of England, it does not have a central religious authority.&nbsp; 
	If you don’t have a designated central authority, who is to say what is 
	heretical and what is not?&nbsp; Moreover, Islam was a truly global religion 
	within a few centuries of its emergence, with the result that a great deal 
	of improvisation had to take place.&nbsp; Take the example of our premier 
	medieval poet, Sayyid Sultan of 17<sup>th</sup> century Bengal.&nbsp; In his 
	magnum opus, <i>Nabi-Bangsa</i>, he blithely includes Brahma-Vishnu-Maheswar 
	as being part of our Nabi’s genealogy.&nbsp; To Sayyid Sultan, as long as he puts 
	Adam as the first, and Muhammad as the last prophet, he was free to chose 
	his pantheon of nabis (prophets) in between. There had been a marvelous 
	number of Muslim heretics over the ages, so many that Tariq Ali devoted a 
	whole chapter—The Joy of Heresy—in his recent book, <i>The Clash of 
	Fundamentalisms</i> (2002). There are however, not many Joan of Arcs, 
	Giordano Brunos or Galileo Galileis in Islam. The case of the Sufi maestro 
	Mansur al-Hallaj’s execution in 922 AD in Baghdad is a rare example, but 
	even that had more to do with his rattling the self-interests of Shia and 
	Sunni political establishments of the time than for committing religious 
	heresy. In light of this, as several Muslim and African intellectuals 
	(including Nobel Laureate, Wole Soywinka) pointed out at the time, what 
	Ayatollah Khomeini did with the issuance of the Rushdie fatwa was not only 
	utterly un-Islamic, but a bad, risible imitation of a Christian Pope or an 
	Archbishop.</span></font></p>

text-indent:36.0pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Back to 
	the Galapagos Islands. It cannot have been easy for Charles Darwin to accept 
	the discoveries that he was making and the conclusions he was forced to draw 
	against the very grain of his own religious upbringing. Over the five years’ 
	duration of the <i>Beagle </i>voyage, Darwin knew he was diverging further 
	and further away from the simple views held by FitzRoy.&nbsp; The two men agreed 
	to disagree and remained friends, obviously because Darwin did not push his 
	ideas too hard on FitzRoy. “Disbelief crept over me,” wrote Darwin, “at a 
	very slow rate but was at last complete.&nbsp; The rate was so slow that I felt 
	no distress, and never doubted even for a single second that my conclusion 
	was correct” (qtd by Moorehead, 205).</span></font></p>

text-indent:36.0pt"><font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The 
	“disbelief” that Darwin is referring to is not exactly what our “suddenly 
	modern” deshi Qur’an-Hadithwalla secularists ignorantly presume it is. As a 
	man of his time, he could not have thoroughly abandoned the idea that the 
	laws of nature might reflect some higher purpose and design of God. Darwin 
	was saying, or at any rate suggesting, that the world had not been created 
	in a week, and certainly not in the year 4004
	<span style="font-variant:small-caps">B.C</span>.&nbsp; It was inconceivably 
	older than this, it had changed out of recognition and was still changing, 
	all the living creatures had changed as well, and man, far from being 
	created in God’s image, may have begun something much more primitive. Darwin 
	did not exactly say that man had descended from an ape, in fact what he did 
	believe was&nbsp;&nbsp; modern man and modern apes had diverged in pre-history from a 
	common line of ancestors. These “lines” are not straight, not even crooked, 
	they are sometimes interrupted, severed, but yet strangely continued, and in 
	some cases, stopped dead on the track, vanished from the face of the earth.

	Darwin’s waiting game had its own danger. His theory could be forestalled by 
	another naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, who was thinking upon the same 
	lines himself. Then, suddenly, in June, 1858, Darwin received a letter from 
	Wallace with an enclosed essay entitled <i>On the Tendencies of Varieties to 
	Depart Indefinite from the Original Type</i>, and a request to send it on to 
	Sir Charles Lyell, the famous geologist, if Darwin thought it was any good.&nbsp; 
	Darwin, as usual, behaved magnanimously. Risking the prospect of his own 
	brilliant theory’s originality smashed and all his work towards it rendered 
	worthless, he sent on Wallace’s article to Lyell with high recommendation 
	without any hesitation. Fortunately, Lyell and the scientific community knew 
	enough of Darwin’s work, and they persuaded him to present a joint paper 
	with Wallace. Next year, in 1859, Darwin published his book, <i>On the 
	Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection, or the preservation of 
	favoured races in the struggle for life. </i>The first edition of 1250 
	copies sold out on the first day of publication.</span></font></p>

	lineage with animals and the Church, as expected, was thoroughly aroused. 
	The clergy came out in full force to do the battle at the famous meeting of 
	the British Association in Oxford in June, 1860. Darwin was not well enough 
	to attend, but his old teacher, Professor Henslow headed the team of 
	Darwinist scientists. Moorehead gives an amusing account of this meeting, 
	and the book has large reprints of caricatures (by “Ape” from the magazine,
	<i>Vanity Fair</i>) of Darwin, T.H. Huxley, the great naturalist who 
	supported Darwin, Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, and Richard Owen, an 
	anatomist in the clergy camp. “There is something anachronistic,” muses 
	Moorhead, “even absurd, about the whole controversy; it seems to belong, not 
	to the last century, but to Middle Ages, and one has to make a conscious 
	effort of the mind to believe that it really happened”(208).</span></font></p>

	which produced a galaxy of star-quality Muslim scientists, physicians, 
	astronomers and philosophers, one can not fail to notice that none of them 
	went through this kind of ordeal or clash with the establishment arm of 
	their religion. Mistaking religious myths as the source of scientific 
	information was never a part of Islam’s ethos as it obviously had been in 
	the Christian faith all the way up to the nineteenth century. “God speaks in 
	metaphors,” emphasizes the Qur’an many times. The celebrated Qur’anic verse 
	from Sura Nur (24), from which Islamic mysticism has derived much gnosis and 
	illuminations, from Mansur al-Hallaj to Imam Ghazzali, ends with these 
	words: “…[W]a yadhribu Allahu-l-amthala li-nnas, wa Allahu bi-kulli sha’i 
	‘alimun” (And God strikes similitudes for men, and God has knowledge of 
	everything. Tr. A. J. Arberry). My own bangla translation (used in one of my 
	poems): “Manusher kacche allahr prostab koto na upoma majhe, allah-i je 
	sarbo bishoye sarboggo.”&nbsp; The utter inability of our NFB’s Quran-Hadithwalla 
	“secularists” to understand that there could possibly be, even if they 
	cannot see it in plain view, symbolic or metaphoric meanings of a religious 
	scripture, makes them bedfellows of these creationists of nineteenth century 
	England and twenty-first century Evangelical Americans.</font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana">No paean to Charles Darwin 
	should be complete these days without paying a tribute to Stephen Jay Gould, 
	who, to my great sorrow, passed away last year at the age of only 63. This 
	Harvard paleontologist was exceptionally brilliant from a very young age, 
	and I remember attending a lecture of his, already a recognized authority on 
	his subject, when I was a freshman at NYU back in 1964, when he could not 
	have been much older than me. Like his beloved guru Darwin, he had a 
	facility with language.&nbsp; Written with clarity needed to explain complex 
	concepts to a general audience, combined with a superb scientific 
	understanding, his numerous articles and books succeeded in making Charles 
	Darwin a household name to the educated American public. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana">In his article titled 
	“Nonmoral Nature” (<i>Natural History</i>, vol. 91, no. 2, 1982), for 
	instance, he tackles a highly controversial issue – the religious “readings” 
	of natural events. Gould opposes the position of the creationists who 
	insisted that the Bible’s version of creation be taught in science courses 
	as scientific fact. His primary point in this essay is that the behavior of 
	certain animals in nature, like the ichneumon wasps who inhabit a live 
	caterpillar as parasites, ruthlessly inflicting pain on a helpless prey, 
	should not be judged by our human moral terms. This issue has presented 
	theologians with an exacting dilemma: if God is good and if creation reveals 
	his goodness, why do nature’s victims suffer? Gould explains how the 19th 
	century naturalists saw the acts of these wasps as comparable to the acts of 
	human thugs who toy with their victims. By applying Darwinian logic, Gould 
	succeeds in showing how to appreciate the wasps for their efficiency for 
	survival. In this way, he asserts, the act of predation can be seen as 
	nonmoral, that is, neither good nor evil. He says, the ichneumon wasps are a 
	detail, and since natural selection is the law that is regulating details, 
	asking the question “why such cruelty?” is one that is posed only in “our 
	terms” and not considering the fact that nature has its own terms to deal 
	with the issues of survival of creatures. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana">Towards the end of his 
	essay, Gould has remarks on creationists and secular humanists that is worth 
	quoting in full:</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">It is amusing in this context, or rather ironic since 
	it is too serious to be amusing, that modern creationists accuse 
	evolutionists of preaching a specific doctrine called secular humanism and 
	thereby demand equal time for their unscientific and discredited views. If 
	nature is nonmoral, then evolution cannot teach any ethical theory at all.&nbsp; 
	The assumption that it can has abetted a&nbsp; panoply of social evils that 
	ideologies falsely read into nature from their beliefs – eugenics and 
	(misnamed) social Darwinism prominently among them. Not only did Darwin 
	eschew any attempt to discover an antireligious ethic in nature, he also 
	expressly stated his personal bewilderment about such deep issues as the 
	problem of evil. …[I]n words that express both the modesty of this splendid 
	man and the compatibility, through lack of contact, between science and true 
	religion, Darwin wrote to Asa Gray*,</font></p>
