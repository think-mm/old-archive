		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The long and expensive trial of 
		the French-Moroccan, Zacarias Moussaoui, the &quot;20<sup>th</sup> hijacker&quot; 
		of the 9-11 attacks in the United States, finally ended on May 4, 2006, 
		when he received a life sentence instead of the death penalty sought by 
		the prosecution. Unless it was false bravado, Moussaoui had taunted the 
		court during his trial, seeming not to care about the possibility of 
		death. Leaving a legacy of martyrdom may have been on his mind. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Given the incredible emotional 
		pressure generated by the 9-11 attacks, the death penalty would not have 
		been a surprise. Yet the American criminal justice system, with all its 
		imperfections and biases, worked as it should. All of the constitutional 
		safeguards for the protection of criminal defendants were applied to 
		Moussaoui's trial. Above all, Moussaoui received the most fundamental of 
		rights – the right to be heard and treated like a human being whose 
		freedom and life could not be taken unless convicted under the strictest 
		standard in American law – something far more than Moussaoui was 
		prepared to give to those he had planned to kill. The very system 
		Moussaoui sought to destroy ensured him the dignity and security of a 
		public trial and in the end, even spared his life. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Moussaoui trial naturally 
		raises a troubling contradiction with the treatment of prisoners being 
		held in legal limbo by the United States at Guantanamo Bay. Some of 
		these prisoners may well have been involved in terrorism. If so, they 
		must be charged and brought to trial, or otherwise released, in keeping 
		with American law. This is the only resolution the international 
		community should accept. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is profoundly ironic that 
		this expensive Moussaoui trial was paid for by the American taxpayers, 
		the very people Moussaoui had come to kill and whose suffering he 
		reveled in during his courtroom outbursts. This irony reveals the 
		intellectual and moral gap that exists between the Islamists' world view 
		and the secularism they seek to destroy – a gap that is perhaps 
		unbridgeable. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Moussaoui, a Muslim who 
		clearly came to kill &quot;infidel&quot; Americans, received the constitutional 
		safeguards guaranteed under American law, it is reasonable to ask what 
		rights a non-Muslim defendant, accused of the attempted murder of 
		Muslims in a Muslim nation, could have expected under an Islamic legal 
		system? For that matter, what rights in general does Islamic law, when 
		unchallenged by secular law, offer non-Muslims under its jurisdiction?
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islamic Shariah law, based on 
		the Koran and the words and deeds of Mohammad (&quot;Hadith&quot;), is a vast, 
		complex and archaic legal system, with four main legal schools and 
		countless jurists, often in significant disagreement. However, what is 
		undisputed is that it is a status based system under which a person's 
		legal rights are determined by their gender and faith. This is not 
		dissimilar to the treatment of the poor in Europe and America during 
		capitalism's early period or in the post- civil war American South, when 
		class and race determined legal status. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Regardless of Islamic law's rich 
		complexity, it is clear on one critical point – non-Muslims are not 
		accorded the same legal status as Muslims. This fact is a cornerstone of 
		Islamic law that no amount of political correctness or apologetics can 
		get around. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Under Islamic law non-Muslims 
		are forced into second class citizenship – inferior and subservient to 
		Muslims and Islam. Much is made by western liberals of Islam's tolerance 
		and protection of Jews and Christians, the &quot;peoples of the book&quot;. 
		However, what is almost never clarified is that these minorities, when 
		they find themselves under Islamic law, are treated as second-class 
		citizens or &quot;Dhimmi&quot;, with very inferior social, political and social 
		rights. For example, whereas, a Muslim may freely marry a non-Muslim 
		woman, a non-Muslim man cannot marry a Muslim woman. The &quot;Dhimmi&quot; are 
		allowed to live provided they pay special taxes (not imposed on Muslims) 
		but their inferiority and humiliation must be permanent, until and 
		unless Islam is accepted. The Koran is quite clear on this point: &quot;Fight 
		them...until they pay tribute out of hand and are utterly subdued&quot; (Sura 
		9:29). The financial inducement to accept Islam is evident. The 
		condition of other minorities who are not &quot;of the book&quot; is even worse, 
		for they are merely pagans without even the &quot;protection&quot; offered to the 
		Dhimmi. Hindu or Filipino workers in Saudi Arabia for example have 
		virtually no legal status or protection and can be readily deported.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pursuant to Islamic law, 
		non-Muslims, whether Dhimmis or otherwise, cannot testify against 
		Muslims. They may only testify against other Dhimmis or other 
		non-Muslims who are temporary visitors (&quot;Musta'min&quot;). The oaths of 
		non-Muslims are not valid in Islamic courts. According to the jurist 
		Muraghi, the testimony of a Dhimmi is not accepted because &quot;God will not 
		let the infidels (kafir) have an upper hand over the believers.&quot; This of 
		course means that a non-Muslim who has been wronged by a Muslim better 
		have friendly Muslim witnesses since non-Muslim testimony will be 
		barred. This is easily remedied if the non-Muslim plaintiff is prepared 
		to convert to Islam, for then Islamic law recognizes his new-found 
		credibility at once. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even more confusing is the law 
		covering killings. The Hanafi School of Islamic law regards the killing 
		of a non-Muslim by a Muslim, or vice-versa, as equal crimes, carrying 
		the same penalty. Other schools are far more hostile and do not regard 
		the killing of a non-Muslim by a Muslim as real murder but rather only 
		as manslaughter invoking only the blood price penalty. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In direct contrast to 
		status-based Islamic law, Western secular law is based upon a political 
		conception of justice whose foundation is the equal treatment before the 
		law regardless of race, class, gender and faith. Moussaoui should have 
		thanked his lucky stars that as he was a Muslim facing trial in a 
		secular country and not a non-Muslim facing Islamic justice. His parting 
		comments claiming he had won and America had lost, clearly showed he had 
		not learnt the difference. Rather he now becomes another casualty of 
		radical Islam, a loss, that the imams who radicalized him and sent him 
		to kill others should be held responsible for. </font></p>
