	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">President Bush in his recent trip to 
	India mentioned Gandhi, Tagore and Nehru in that order as thinkers who 
	shaped the destiny of India. These three names indicate a certain mode of 
	representative ideology of the Indian establishment and also the politics of 
	ideological representation. A few years ago the University Grants Commission 
	of India recognized Gautama Buddha, Gandhi, Ambedkar and Nehru as the epoch 
	making thinkers of India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It also directed the Indian 
	universities to institute special chairs and research centres in their 
	names. Evidently these names are a product of intensive deliberations. In 
	these four names one can see the globally known positive system built by 
	Buddha, who established an alternative Sangha system, that gradually emerged 
	as the Buddhist religion in ancient India. As against the names of Kautilya 
	and Manu, Buddha alone was seen as a thinker to be recognized as the epoch 
	making thinker of that period. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the modern period, Gandhi 
	undoubtedly is credited as one of the epoch making thinkers. Even though one 
	may not agree with many of his ideological positions one does not dispute 
	his role as an epoch maker. Ambedkar occupies the second place in the modern 
	period as an epoch maker because he played a political, ideological and 
	philosophical role to abolish caste- slavery and untouchability in India, a 
	role that is comparable to that of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King. 
	Both Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King are seen as epoch makers in 
	American history. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nehru is recognized as an epoch 
	making thinker because he steered the Indian administrative set-up through a 
	colonial phase into an independent one with administrative acumen. Thus, 
	Gandhi, Ambedkar and Nehru are identified as epoch making thinkers of modern 
	India. How does Rabindranath Tagore figure in President Bush’s speech and 
	how is Ambedkar ignored ? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Delhi the Bengal lobby is quite 
	strong. It influences the central Government’s culture in many ways and 
	Tagore was the tallest figure of Bengal. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bengali writers projectTagore as the 
	tallest individual of India and deliberately avoid Ambedkar as a significant 
	figure of modern India, leave alone as an epoch making thinker. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most visible and recent example 
	of such Bengali intellectual tradition is Amartya Sen’s international best 
	seller ---The Argumentative Indian. In this book Gandhi, Tagore and Nehru 
	figure as the thinkers who shaped modern India. In Sen’s scheme in ancient 
	India it was Ashoka, but not Buddha who figures as an epoch making thinker. 
	In early modern India, Akbar is projected as a thinker of unmatched 
	intellect. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Theory for liberation </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fact that Ambedkar does not 
	merit mention even though he constructed a theory for the liberation of the 
	most exploited underdog of India and sought to liberate that untouchable 
	underdog is a travesty of intellectual representation. Ambedkar’s name is 
	mentioned by Sen on only four times and that too for his position as the 
	chairman of the drafting committee of the constitution -- but not as a 
	visionary. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore is a poet, but not a thinker 
	with a liberative ideology. No one has any objection if he is recognized as 
	a great poet of modern India. Let us not forget the fact that Bush had to 
	mention Martin Luther King even in his speeches, who has played a similar 
	role like that of Ambedkar in India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Any nation would have a respectable 
	representation of intellectual tradition if the national psyche recognizes 
	those intellectuals who represented the most oppressed people of a given 
	society. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why do Americans think that Abraham 
	Lincoln was their greatest president and Martin Luther King was their 
	greatest civil libertarian? Both of them got that national and international 
	stature because they stood for abolition of slavery and racial 
	discrimination. Ambedkar should have got a similar stature if the national 
	elite were to develop any sense of shame of the institution of caste and 
	untouchability which have worse characteristics than the racism of America 
	and Europe. But that was not to be so. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore’s greatest poem is Gitanjali. 
	What liberational message does it have for the oppressed Dalit-Bahujans? A 
	philosophically aesthetic poem like the Gitanjali must have got India the 
	first Nobel prize. But that in itself did not re-shape India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The millions of suppressed and 
	exploited masses of India do not revere him. If he does not figure in school 
	text books his name would not have been known among the masses at all.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ambedkar’s name has a different 
	value. That value did not come to him because his name was pushed through 
	the officially written school text books. He is seen as a thinker who keeps 
	on liberating the oppressed masses on a continuous basis. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The projection of this kind of a 
	liberative thinker among the intellectual internationally and 
	socio-political circles would have given an impression that this country has 
	an open mind and principled value for human freedom. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If India does not abolish caste and 
	untouchability using all the ideological tools that Ambedkar had handed down 
	to this country what does freedom that Bush is talking from Purana Qila mean 
	to these oppressed masses?</font></p>
