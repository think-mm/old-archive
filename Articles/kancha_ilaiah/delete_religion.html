	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a child when I followed my 
	illiterate shepherd father, neither my parents nor my village social forces 
	knew what India meant, where its borders began and where they ended. This 
	was true of many village communities all over India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whether the social mass in the 
	village India was free or was bonded was decided on the caste position 
	within the village but not based on nationality of that mass. The nationhood 
	of India was not existent for them. For them, the notion nation had no 
	meaning whatsoever. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If somebody was born in an upper 
	caste, he/she had more freedom and more respect of self and of the other 
	than those who were born in lower castes. If somebody was born in a Madiga/Chamar 
	family, he/she was born bonded and untouchable. His/her self was untouchable 
	to all the castes above that one. For any village being, the social location 
	in the caste system gave both power/wealth or powerlessness/poverty. For a 
	long time the nation with its power or powerlessness did not peep into our 
	lives. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The real villages were not like Karl 
	Marx's imagined villages. They were neither self sufficient independent 
	entities within themselves nor were they socially and economically connected 
	to one another so intimately. They were messy places in plains adjacent to 
	forests. The connection between village and village was limited. People's 
	connections were within their respective castes even of other villages. 
	Social life was stifled and economic life was primitive and precarious.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With a Government school coming into 
	the villages in early Sixties, the nation began to connect with the village. 
	Child education became a symbolic dream of their nationalist modernity. 
	Education landed in our village like a helicopter of election season. In any 
	early formative linguistic state, a beginning of modern education in a newly 
	fashioned nationalist language—Telugu, Kannada so on—setting aside the 
	caste-tribal languages, in which social groups were communicating with each 
	other was cultural long jump. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">School brought into our life symbols 
	of nationalism—quite innocently the religious symbols of the dominant 
	castes, as they wrote the lessons in the image of their culture: the culture 
	of Hinduism. A Muslim child was to learn that culture as his/her—though not 
	of his/her—as national. Rama and Krishna were put in our lives as national 
	heroes but not as religious heroes of particular religion. Rig Veda and 
	Bhagavad Gita were said to have been the most inspiring nationalistic books.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The born bonded children—I mean the 
	Dalit children—were not yet entering into the school but here and there, 
	there were Muslim and Christian children in early days of education. If a 
	Dalit family became Christian, the nationalist teacher would allow that 
	family's child to sit in the class as touchable. But while teaching about 
	Hindu God's image as nationalist image there were no doubts in the mind of 
	teacher that religion and nation were two different things. If there was a 
	Muslim or Christian teacher he/she could not dare to say that Quran or Bible 
	was a nationalist book too. Thus, nationalism and Hinduism became 
	synonymous. Naturally who got empowered morally and ideologically in that 
	environment? A Hindu nationalist. Neither a Muslim nor a Christian nor a 
	Dalit-Bahujan self got constructed as nationalist. Naturally hardly any 
	power had flown into their mind. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But that nationalism had no social 
	basis of establishing a level playing field wherein the caste and religious 
	barriers could be erased and a secular self could be created out of all 
	human beings where humanism could operate at a larger social scale. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In those days, we did not realize 
	that by reading those text books we were going to produce a crippled mind 
	that would push us into a culture of indignity of labour. We hardly 
	understood labour was basically responsible for the advance of science and 
	technology, as our parents who were involved in labour constantly were 
	abused as foolish. We too developed hatred towards that labour. We too 
	thought labour and education were inimical. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If we fail in our further studies we 
	had no place to go back because shepherding, tilling, pot making, shoe 
	making and so on were not supposed to be taken by educated as they were not 
	considered to be nationalist professions. Many of us did not realize that 
	that mode of nationalist education was going to make us powerless in 
	otherwise imagined India of empowerment. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our education in regional language 
	slapped us on the face to say that ``you are misfit in an Anglicized 
	universal India''. The prospects of power came here via a convent school 
	that an ardent Hinduwadi would also go to preferably to a school of St 
	Joseph or St Mary. We suddenly, at that late age, realized that national 
	empowerment takes place through Self-Empowerment and that comes through 
	English. And it was operating through a theoretical twist, of course, that 
	English had come here through a conspiracy of Macaulay and we should be 
	careful in allowing all to learn it. To enter into that linguistic domain 
	and to learn the tongue twisting theory, we were too late in age and too 
	weak in mind. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A nation cannot become an empowered 
	nation if an exceptional being like the present President of India who could 
	become a scientist having gone through hardships of Tamil education or like 
	the present Prime Minister who is said to have studied under street lights— 
	perhaps in Punjabi medium to start with—and became an economist of his 
	stature and moved into that position. Nowhere exceptions empowered a nation.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Only when the social mass gets an 
	empowering education that empowers the nation. As of now our education 
	system had not produced a social mass that can translate their parental and 
	communitarian historical science and technological experience into modernist 
	science and technology. The religion-centric nationalist education kept all 
	the religious identities on the national table to drive daggers into each 
	other. The caste-centred cultural spheres made us treat each caste an enemy 
	of the other. A real secular self, with an inbuilt sense of dignity of 
	labour, is yet to be born. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A scientific temper that can 
	challenge, our very neighbour, China, if not the West, may spring up if we 
	recognise English as necessary national language to be taught on par with 
	every regional language in every state from class one to every child. We 
	must—and must—take out all forms of religious content from text books and 
	teach dignity of labour on compulsory basis. Perhaps India then begins to 
	empower itself.</font></p>
