	<font face="Lucida Sans">GPD (<i>Who's Afraid of Buddhadeb?</i> ,EPW May 
	20,2006)'s observation that the communists <i>&quot;may have come back to power 
	in West Bengal but some still think they have failed to change with the 
	times. The feeling is that Buddhadeb has his economics right but has to 
	carry a dated party with him&quot; </i>reflects the opinion of the elite that 
	wants a Left with armchair revolutionism.<br>
	<br>
	The Left Front has not only become a pink front but gradually also underwent 
	a steady embourgeoisment. The CPI(M)'s over-emphasis on parliamentarism 
	reminds one of Marx's famous phrase in the Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis 
	Bonaparte (1). From the very beginning, CPI(M) has been shifting towards 
	parliamentarism. From incorporation of section 112 in the original party 
	programme - laying down bounds of participation in a government - to present 
	justification of capitalism, the shift remains irreversible. <b>Even the 
	slogan, <i>&quot;West Bengal is a colony of the Central government&quot;, </i>coined 
	by so-called hardcore Stalinist Promode Dasgupta in the 1971 elections, was 
	to maximize electoral advantage. It was a straight copy from Sheikh Mujibur 
	Rahman's one point slogan - East Pakistan, a colony of West Pakistan - that 
	helped Awami League to win all but three seats from East Pakistan to the 
	Pakistan National Assembly in 1970 and majority in the PNA.</b><br>
	<br>
	In 2004, West Bengal state committee of CPI(M) issued a party letter, 
	exclusively for party members, on modalities of organizing the unorganized 
	workers and strategy of struggle. <i>&quot; We want to undertake a survey of 
	every region. CITU in districts will have to take the help of Krishak Sabha 
	to do that. In towns and villages, the survey has to be booth-based 
	(emphasis added)&quot;.</i> (2) The emphasis was on polling booths instead of 
	mouzas or wards. Thus the motto of organizing the unorganized is 
	subordinated to electoral goals.<br>
	<br>
	That apart, ever since Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had moved into the shoes of 
	Jyoti Basu as the chief minister, he has been trying to woo investors 
	including MNCs, going beyond the party line and he got full support from the 
	late Anil Biswas, the state party chief since 1998 (until his death in the 
	last week of March. <b>In an interview to the Kolkata edition of the 
	Statesman just after his return from Singapore in August last year, 
	Bhattacharjee openly said (3), &quot;Globalisation is a must. Nobody can stop it. 
	And we have to&nbsp; admit it.&quot; Biswas dished out a strange concept that the 
	development activities under the Left Front in &quot;a form of class 
	struggle&quot;(4).</b><br>
	<br>
	The two West Bengal leaders - both members of polit bureau - deviated from 
	the CPI(M)'s line at its 18th Congress in New Delhi. The essence of <i>&quot;the 
	present phase of globalization&quot;,</i> the party thinks, is <i>&quot;rapacious 
	drive to maximize profits by removing restrictions on the movement of 
	capital.&quot; </i>On the neocons' global strategy, species, &quot; given the fact 
	that globalization seeks to undermine, if not nullify, national economic 
	sovereignty our effort should be directed to protect and strengthen 
	sovereignty.&quot; Needless to say, no party member can cross the bounds set out 
	by the last party congress in the political-organisational report.(5)<br>
	<br>
	GPD may note that but workers - even employees of state government and state 
	PSUs - are getting increasingly frustrated with the LF government's patch-up 
	with capitalism, despite Bhattacharya's pre-poll gesture. &quot;We are trying to 
	be friendly with the capitalists&quot; - what does it mean? You want investment 
	and they want profits. This is understandable, in fact a question of mutual 
	interest. But where does the question of friendship arise?&quot; he told at press 
	conferences(6). On the one hand, he made it clear that socialism was not on 
	the agenda - perhaps not even in the perspective, the media-happy CM did 
	shed crocodile tears for the working class. &quot;In the context of capitalist 
	globalisation, we continue to firmly hold on to that belief. We think about 
	the workers of closed factories. Although a pittance, we have decided to pay 
	them five hundred rupees allowance. Has any other state in the country done 
	this?&quot;. (7) <b>There is a fallacy in the statement. Not all workers of 
	closed or locked-out factories (for over a year) get this allowance. 
	Secondly, this pittance is stopped once a worker completes 58 years. 
	Thirdly, workers of closed/locked-out factories are very often deprived of 
	gratuity on plea that they do not apply for the same within 30 days of 
	closure/lockout but there is no legal bar against payment of gratuity on 
	30-day ground.</b><br>
	<br>
	Workers generally hope that their factories will reopen. So the claim that 
	the LF government is worker-friendly is not free from doubts. Let's have a 
	glimpse of the plight of workers and employment trends. In 2003, 9120 
	persons got employment in factories while 635,000 workers had lost their 
	jobs in 432 locked-out companies/factories. Provident Fund dues of 
	employers, payable to staff and workers had gone up three-fold between 
	1989-90 and 2003-04 in West Bengal. Between 1990 and 2004, ESI arrears went 
	up from Rs 35 crores to Rs 203 crores. All these are from published data, 
	mostly available in the annual publication, Labour in West Bengal, brought 
	out by the Government of West Bengal. Despite all this, when the CM says, 
	&quot;From the ideological standpoint, I firmly believe that capitalism is not a 
	finality&quot;, it sounds like pathetic quibble.<br>
	<br>
	Bhattacharjee repeatedly assured the captains of industry in their fora of 
	intolerance to &quot;labour militancy&quot;, as if in such a worrisome situation 
	working people should not launch militant labour movement. The CPI(M) 
	biggies and capitalists equate 'militancy' with 'terrorism'. Unfortunate 
	indeed. Small wonder, the US Ambassador sent greetings to Bhattacharya in no 
	time, as perhaps never in the past. George W Bush has no reasons to be 
	worried as the LF government is not in the way of capitalist path. The basic 
	opposition to capitalist way of development in the CPI(M) party programme 
	reduces to a verbal missile.<br>
	<br>
	Let's look at the state of share-croppers or Bargadars. The CPI(M) and the 
	LF government had the moral right to be proud of Operation Barga (OB),which 
	in fine accorded legal shield against eviction of Bargadars. But now the 
	CPI(M) and its largest mass front, state unit of All India Krishak Sabha 
	wants to abolish Barga or share-cropping system. At the 20th conference of 
	West Bengal state conference ( 22-25 February 2002), the party delegates 
	unanimously expressed resentment that &quot;the peasant front took no effort to 
	put an end to Barga system.With the entry of capitalism, Barga system is 
	bound to be a thing of the past&quot;.(8)<br>
	<br>
	GPD however rightly concludes that 'the truth probably was or ought to be 
	that Buddhadeb knows his economics right but has to carry a dated party with 
	him. We cannot possibly say if this reading of the situation is right. But 
	there is one pleasant, cheerful question in the air. Who is afraid of 
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharya?&quot; . Neither the bourgeoisie nor the landlords are 
	afraid of CPI(M) in West Bengal, least of all Bhattacharjee or his 
	enthusiastic commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, a central committee 
	member of CPI(M). Lastly, the LF government has welcomed the Salim group of 
	Indonesia to invest in a number of projects like a motor cycle factory at 
	Uluberia in Howrah district and a cluster of projects including a knowledge 
	park and health city in South 24 Parganas district. Let's forget about the 
	murky past of Indonesian group as an associate in the CIA-backed massacre of 
	over a million of communists and members of mass front of Communist Party of 
	Indonesia (PKI) in 1965 and thereafter. The group doesn't have an easily 
	accessible website and its falilure and bankruptcy in trade, industry and 
	banking is wellknown.(9) An interested analyst wrote to Asian Times 
	recently, &quot;Folks..I am looking for information on Salim Group, Indonesia. 
	The Chief Minister from the State of West Bengal (India), is visiting 
	Indonesia currently, and understood to have signed a deal with this Group 
	for investment in West Bengal. Obviously the info required is for 
	intellectual purpose. There are many questions on the background of this 
	Group&quot;.(<a href="http://forum.atimes.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3428">http://forum.atimes.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3428</a>)<br>

	(<font size="2">1)The perspective was different as Marx blamed the 
	bourgeoisie wholly for parliamentary opportunism to pave the way for the 
	lumpen Bonaparte. &quot;It took this parliamentary cretinism for those who had 
	destroyed all the conditions of parliamentary power with their own hands, 
	and were bound to destroy them in their struggle with the other classes, 
	still to regard their parliamentary victories as victories&quot;( Chapter V of

	4. However, it will not be fair to blame the West Bengal leadership of CPI(M) 
	for emphatic parliamentarism. A document, New Situation and Tasks, issued by 
	the party's central committee in 1967 revealed that para 112 or first party 
	programme of CPI(M), adopted not at the 1964 at the Seventh Congress - 
	rather the first of the new party - but immediately thereafter as an 
	amendment. The resolution, moved by the minority at the 16th Congress in 
	Calcutta -5-11 October 1998- ( led by Jyoti Basu and Harkishan Singh Surjeet) 
	on participation at the United Front government in 1996 stated that this was 
	&quot;necessitated by the situation obtaining then. Immediately after the Party 
	Congress, the Party in Kerala had to face elections. The issue arose whether 
	being a major alternative or not&quot; (Political Organisational Report, adopted 
	by the 16th Congress of CPI(M), p 42). At that time, the party leadership 
	used to buck up the party to be prepared for an armed revolution as the 
	bourgeoisie might not voluntarily give up power, even after parliamentary 
	defeat. The debate on this was a compulsion for the party after his 
	explosive interview with M J Akbar, carried in Asian Age on 1 January 1997 
	that the party made a 'historic blunder' by not joining the UF government. 
	It was through at the PB but knocked down by the central committee. The 
	rejection was endorsed by the 16th Congress by an overwhelming majority of 
	delegates. Yet Basu never gave up his position In November 200 he told PTI, 
	&quot;I still think it was a historic blunder because history doesn't give 
	chances&quot;, Basu told PTI on 5 November 2000 (Party committed historic blunder
