	<p><b>========================================</b></p>
	<p><b>Toronto Star </b></p>
	<p>'<b>No Sharia law in Ontario' </b></p>
	<p>KEITH LESLIE CANADIAN PRESS </p>
	<p>Sep. 11, 2005. 09:34 PM </p>
	<p>Ontario will not become the first Western jurisdiction to allow the use 
	of a set of centuries' old religious rules called Sharia law to settle 
	Muslim family disputes, and will ban all religious arbitrations in the 
	province, Premier Dalton McGuinty told The Canadian Press on Sunday. In a 
	telephone interview with the national news agency, McGuinty announced his 
	government would move quickly to outlaw existing religious tribunals used 
	for years by Christians and Jews under Ontario's Arbitration Act. </p>
	<p>&quot;I've come to the conclusion that the debate has gone on long enough,&quot; he 
	said. </p>
	<p>&quot;There will be no Sharia law in Ontario. There will be no religious 
	arbitration in Ontario. There will be one law for all Ontarians.&quot; </p>
	<p>McGuinty said religious arbitrations &quot;threaten our common ground,&quot; and 
	promised his Liberal government would introduce legislation &quot;as soon as 
	possible&quot; to outlaw them in Ontario. </p>
	<p>&quot;Ontarians will always have the right to seek advice from anyone in 
	matters of family law, including religious advice,&quot; he said. ``But no longer 
	will religious arbitration be deciding matters of family law.&quot; </p>
	<p>Last December, a report from former NDP attorney general Marion Boyd 
	recommended the province allow and regulate Sharia arbitrations much the 
	same way it does Christian and Jewish tribunals, setting off a firestorm of 
	protests. </p>
	<p>Homa Arjomand, the women's rights activist who organized a series of 
	protests across Canada and Europe last Thursday to convince McGuinty to 
	abandon Sharia, was elated when she heard the news late Sunday. </p>
	<p>&quot;I think our voice got heard loud and clear, and I thank the government 
	for coming out with no faith-based arbitrations,&quot; said Arjomand. &quot;Oh, I am 
	so happy. That was the best news I have ever heard for the past five years.&quot;
	</p>
	<p>A representative from Ontario's Jewish community expressed disappointment 
	and shock over McGuinty's decision. </p>
	<p>&quot;We're stunned,&quot; said Joel Richler, Ontario region chairman of the 
	Canadian Jewish Congress. </p>
	<p>&quot;At the very least, we would have thought the government would have 
	consulted with us before taking away what we've had for so many years.&quot; </p>
	<p>Richler said the current system - in place since 1992 - has worked well 
	and saw no reason for it to be changed for either his or other communities.
	</p>
	<p>&quot;If there have been any problems flowing from any rabbinical court 
	decisions, I'm not aware of them,&quot; he said. </p>
	<p>Despite calling for an end to all religious arbitrations, Ontario's New 
	Democrats were not happy with the way McGuinty handled the Sharia debate.
	</p>
	<p>&quot;By merely sitting on the issue, and by hiding his head in the sand, 
	McGuinty allowed the debate to in fact fester and grow pretty ugly,&quot; said 
	NDP justice critic Peter Kormos. &quot;That was not helpful to anything in this 
	multicultural community of ours.&quot; </p>
	<p>Opposition leader John Tory agreed with the NDP's position that McGuinty 
	mishandled the Sharia debate. </p>
	<p>&quot;One of the tests of leadership in a diverse society is that you not 
	allow issues like this - which are complex - to boil over into angry, 
	polarized debates,&quot; said Tory. </p>
	<p>&quot;By letting it go on, and suddenly ending it mysteriously on a Sunday 
	afternoon, is not probably the best kind of leadership that one could show.&quot;
	</p>
	<p>Currently, Ontario's Arbitration Act allows civil disputes ranging from 
	custody and support to divorce and inheritance to be resolved through an 
	independent arbitrator, if both parties agree. </p>
	<p>Catholics, Mennonites, Jews, aboriginals and Jehovah's Witnesses, among 
	others, have - until now - used the act to settle family law questions 
	without resorting to the courts. </p>
	<p>But those who opposed permitting Sharia family arbitration argued that 
	the reforms would give legitimacy and an unenforceable appearance of 
	oversight to a legal code they say is - at its heart - unfair to women. </p>
	<p>McGuinty said the debate around Sharia gave his government time to &quot;step 
	back a little bit&quot; and look at the original decision to allow religious 
	arbitrations in Ontario. </p>
	<p>&quot;It became pretty clear that was not in keeping with the desire of 
	Ontarians to build on common ground . of one law for all Ontarians,&quot; he 
	said. </p>
	<p>The premier said his wife Terri had not raised the Sharia law issue with 
	him during the lengthy debate, but noted the 17 women in his Liberal caucus 
	urged him to reject the idea. </p>
	<p>Just hours before McGuinty's announcement, a group including author 
	Margaret Atwood, activist Maude Barlow, writer June Callwood and actresses 
	Shirley Douglas and Sonja Smits issued an open letter to the premier on 
	behalf of the No Religious Arbitration Coalition. </p>
	<p>During last Thursday's protests, angry demonstrators outside the Ontario 
	legislature likened McGuinty to Afghanistan's former extremist Taliban 
	leaders for even considering Sharia. </p>
	<p>Speakers in Toronto called McGuinty naive for saying women's rights would 
	not be trampled if Ontario allowed Sharia, while 100 people braved the rain 
	in Montreal to protest the use of Sharia law in Ontario. Similar rallies 
	were held in Ottawa and Victoria, while smaller protests were held in 
	London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dusseldorf, Germany. </p>
	<p>Tariq Fatah, head of the Muslim Canadian Congress, which has called for 
	reforms within Canada's more traditional Muslim organizations, called 
	McGuinty's surprise announcement &quot;a great victory for all Canadians, but 
	particularly Muslims in Canada, and a defeat for Islamic fundamentalists and 
	those who are preaching it in Canada.&quot;</p>
