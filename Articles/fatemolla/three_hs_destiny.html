  Three Hours of Destiny </span></font></b></p>
  <p align="center"><b>fatemolla</b></p>
  <p>This is not the story of Shiraj-Clive Meerjaffar. It is of those 3 hours 
  that forever shaped the destiny of a billion people of today, including us. 
  How? Words are not enough; we have to see the drama ourselves. Let us go 
  there, to &quot; Lokkho - Baag&quot;, the Mango-orchard of Palassey, on 22nd June 1757.
  </p>
  <p>Lord Clive, not “Lord” yet, is there, anxious, restless, under great 
  tension and stress. Starting as a clerk in East India Company, he emerged as 
  the founder of an enormous British Empire of India. Now with his tiny strength 
  he is face to face with the huge army of the Nabab Shiraj-Ud- Doulla. </p>
  <p>Clive has only 3000 soldiers, the Nabab has 30,000. He has only 8 Kamans of 
  6 pounds each, the Nabab has 53 Kamans of 18, 24 and 32 pounds. It is no match 
  ! Is he going to commit suicide? No, he is not. He and his stars know it very 
  well that his real strength is not the number of soldiers or mortarss. His 
  real strength is the group of Meerjaffar, Manikchand, Umichand, Rajballav, 
  Raydurlav, Krishnaballav, Nandakumar, Jagatsheth gong. The snake is waiting 
  for a perfect bite. The air of Bengal is heavily polluted with the deep 
  conspiracy of these people against the Nabab. </p>
  <p>You can no blame them. Isn’t it the Nabab himself who slapped Jagatsheth to 
  the ground right in the Darbar in front of everybody? Isn’t it him who removed 
  his aged father-in-law Meerjaffar from the position of Army-chief? And put a 
  much younger Mohanlal in that position? Isn’t it he who ordered everybody 
  including Meerjaffar to salute Mohanlal in Darbar? Is this not the reason why 
  Meerjaffar stopped coming to the Darber? </p>
  <p>And according to &quot;Siarul Mutakhkharin&quot; of Golam Hosain, the authentic book 
  referred to in many books, </p>
  <p>&quot;&quot;The character of this Nabab was not any better than that of Nero, the 
  torturous king of Rome. And what says Jinn Law’, the French warrior, who 
  himself tried to save the Nabab ? &quot;His character was the worst….famous for 
  womanizing, …..everybody knew about his extreme cruelty…..used to drown the 
  boats in the river….with women and children…used to enjoy it sitting on the 
  bank……..&quot; ( See ref ). In the destined footsteps of time, a boat was drowned 
  in the midnight of June, 1760 in the Buriganga, killing 70 relatives of the 
  Nabab including his wife Lutfunnesa and mother Amena Begum. It was 
  deliberately done by the order of Meerjaffar. Let us come back to Palassey.
  </p>
  <p>Morning of 23rd June, 1757. The battle started at 8 AM. The big chunk of 
  the army under Meerjaffar stood idle, the smaller ones under Mirmadan, 
  Mohanlal and in their support the small French army under Sinfrey totally 
  cornered Clive’s soldiers in the orchard. And then it rained heavily. This is 
  the rain in Bengal which turned the history upside down. All the gun powder of 
  the winning team got wet, they had to pause. But even then, Clive’s defeat was 
  definite and visible. The conspirators did not sit idle. They convinced the 
  Nabab to stop the fighting for the day. Nabab agreed. He ordered his winning 
  soldiers to stop. </p>
  <p>Do you remember the disaster of British Army in Dunkirk in 2nd world-war ? 
  When Paris fell to Hitler in 17 /or 19 days ( The plan was to take Paris in 90 
  days !), the best of British Army, 300,000 soldiers with huge ammunition were 
  sent under the command of Lord Gort to recapture France from Germany. The 
  moment they crossed the English Channel and landed in Dunkirk, they 
  unexpectedly saw themselves absolutely surrounded by Germans, under the paw of 
  death. The only way to save life was to run back to England, crossing the 
  English Channel again, leaving everything behind. The way the British nation 
  used everything possible to save their soldiers, is written brightly in the 
  history. The amount of ammunitions they had to leave behind was enormous. ( A 
  whole war could be fought by those…- Churchill ). Hitler could have killed 
  them by bombing on the English Channel. But surprisingly he stopped the 
  attacking German bombers from doing that. This is one of the mysteries of 
  world-war 2. Long back I went through a voluminous research of Sayad Muztaba 
  Ali on this mystery ( He studied in Germany to get his PhD ). Also many others 
  worked on this issue. </p>
  <p>For the Nabab, the fight of &quot;next day&quot; never came. In the midnight, Lord 
  Clive, major Watson and major Kilpatric launched a sudden unexpected attack, 
  Meerjaffar and Co. joined them, Nabab's soldiers became scattered, The Nabab 
  ran away in panic. He straight ran to the Palace of Murshidabad, took wife 
  Lutfa and daughter Zahoora with him and started to north in a boat in the 
  river Mahananda. From the unseen the destiny of Bengal / India was looking at 
  him in the shape of his golden shoe which he put on. ( He was identified due 
  to this shoe, and got captured, a popular story says). </p>
  <p>He started towards north. Why to north? Because he was trying to reach 
  Patna. Why Patna ? Because few months back he had sent and posted his loyal 
  50,000 soldiers there. Why he did that ? Because at that time, Ahmad Shah 
  Abdali from Iran attacked and captured Dilli. Nabab had a plan to resist him 
  in Patna in case Abdali attacks Bengal. Now he was trying to reach his loyal 
  soldiers there in Patna. By then the news of Palassey reached everywhere. From 
  Bhagalpur, Bihar, French captain Lalley had already started for Murshidabad 
  with his troop to help the Nabab. Before some months, Clive cunningly had 
  convinced the Nabab to exile Lalley to Bhagalpur. Before leaving, Lalley told 
  the Nabab in tears, </p>
  <p>&quot; Nabab, you are heading to a wrong direction of politics&quot;. </p>
  <p>The time-distance between the soldiers of Lalley and the Nabab to meet each 
  other was only 3 hours. After that Shiraj would get the strong shelter of 
  Lalley. Lalley would reach him to his loyal cheerful 50,000 soldiers in Patna. 
  With a tremendous strength the Nabab would come back like a devastating storm.
  </p>
  <p>No further mistake he would do, no more blunder he would commit. Because by 
  then he knew all the faces of friends and foes. Like a wild buffalo he would 
  crush the palace of conspiracy of Clive-Meerjaffar. He would uproot the East 
  India Company from Bengal, for ever. Bengal would not be a British colony. The 
  whole India would not be molested under British-boots for 190 years. The 
  mass-killing of Jalianwalabag would not happen, Hundreds of Ram Muhammad Sing 
  Azads would not be born. Thousands of Rashid Alis, Shurjya Shens, Matongini 
  Hazras and Fuleshwaris would not be killed. Netaji would not leave in darkness 
  to snatch the sun of independence. Millions of &quot;Mukti- Pagol&quot; patriots, both 
  men and women, would not be burnt in the huge fire of tremendous effort of 
  freeing the motherland. The ‘Keyamat’ of ‘Neel’ would not destroy the 
  peasants, thumbs of Moslin-weavers would not be cut in Bengal. We would not 
  have a blood-bath in 1971. </p>
  <p>Centuries have passed. Those spellbound, anxious 3 hours are still waiting 
  on the bank of Mahananda in search of the lost Nabab.</p>
