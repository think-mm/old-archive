  <p>I raised some concerns and questions about the Qura’an, THE BOOK of 1.2 
  billion people from one side. And it will only be honest to deal with some 
  aspects of the same book, which kept many, even some unbelievers, spellbound 
  for all the time. Not too many, but only 3 of those will be cited, 2 of them 
  will be echoed from the posting of a Brother (sorry, forgot the name, should 
  not have, pardon me) in NFB. Those may be repetition and boring, but heavy and 
  yet to be answered.</p>
  <p><b>1. How many books are there in the world altogether?</b><br>
  Innumerable. Is there a single book, which is completely memorized by a single 
  person? The answer is a B-I-I-I-G “NO”. Any devout fan of Tagore or 
  Shakespeare can not even dream of memorizing a single book, though they 
  understand the writings. What about the writers themselves? Sorry, they also 
  do not dream of it. <b>The Qura’an, is THE ONLY book which is memorized ‘DOT 
  TO DOT’ </b>(a) by millions; (b) by 12 years olds (I have a cousin in my 
  village); (c) without understanding a word of it. And that is not a joke. If 
  we would not have seen it, we would never, never believe it. But it is fact. 
  Are these Hafizes super humans or ETs? Nope! They are commoners, not at all 
  extra talented or gifted in any way. Many a times they are even more “Dull’ 
  than us. Then how they can do it? No doubt, there must be a force behind it, 
  which enables extreme commoners to achieve this impossibility, again, without 
  understanding a word of it. What is that force? Here we are talking about 
  860000 (not a typo) components of the Qura’an. Many a times when I looked at 
  these tiny little boys/girls playing with balls/dolls, I had to light a 
  cigarette in utter disbelief. Point of<br>
  <b><i>note: - </i></b>I promised my same Hafiz-cousin a radio-cassette 
  recorder as a gift (A dream<br>
  for a 12 years old village boy) if he could memorize “Shesher Kobita” or<br>
  “Porosh Pathor” of Tagore. He tried hard for weeks, but never succeeded.<br>
  <b>Critics, please explain the memory-process of this boy and come up with 
  only<br>
  one example of anybody memorizing any book, even a thin one, even if written<br>
  by herself/himself, anywhere, anytime.</b></p>
  <p><b>2. In Sahi-Sitta including Sahi Bokhari, we get hundreds of exact quotes 
  of the Prophet’s (SA) sayings. Those contain words and sentences as he said, 
  and were reported by different Sahabis, Tabeyeens, Taba-Tabeyeens. The words 
  used, the constructions of sentences, and the modes of expression is the same 
  in all those Hadises.</b> And those are constantly and extremely different 
  from those of the Qura’an. In Bangla we have 2 very different styles of 
  writings from the same man; one as Shomoresh Boshu (Bibor, etc.) and Kaalkut ( 
  Srworno Shikhor Pranggone”, “ Amritokumbher Shondhane- cinema made with Uttom 
  Kumar). Both are the same person. Same with Bhanushingho. But here the 
  difference is incredible and beyond any<br>
  explanation, and it happened before 1500 years.</p>
  <p><b>3. We all have a unique style of expression in our choice of words and 
  construction of sentences in talking and writing, in different moods. </b>This 
  style slowly changes with time. A considerable change becomes apparent in 5 
  years. In 10 years, the difference becomes strongly apparent and 
  visible.(Please don’t ask for reference of this, I never thought it would be 
  needed anytime, so I did not keep it). And here is a book, kept<br>
  flowing continuously for long 23 years in one and only one constant tune.</p>
  <p><b>4. When we look at the words/sentences of our own language before 300, 
  500, 800 years, the evolution becomes apparent. </b>Though our own mother 
  tongue, its very old scriptures are just not understandable by none but 
  ourselves, the Bangalees. The Buddhist Chorjapods, discovered from the palace 
  of Nepal by Pondit Horoproshad Shastree are good examples. Some more are handy 
  here now, but quoting those will only make it longer. Shakespearian English is 
  a dream to understand ( for commoners like fatemolla). Like all the languages 
  of the world the Arabic also must have evolved significantly in long one 
  thousand five hundred years. But how the Qura’anic language<br>
  stood immune to that evolution? How it is still, and will stay evergreen? This 
  is the only<br>
  religious book in the world, where the Creator talks to His creation as “I” 
  and “You”, in first and second person. Apart from the violence and other 
  contradictions, the dignity,<br>
  highness, depth, majesty, eloquence and melody of its wordings and expression 
  transcend the limitation of time, defeats the effect of time on it. What force 
  is working behind this only one book of the world?<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>The Qura’anic debate is not a fare debate. Because, the critics are in 
  an<br>
  advantageous position. </b>In this debate, the believers has to prove that the<br>
  Qura’an from cover to cover is without a shadow of mistake/contradiction.<br>
  That is like a solid wall painted without a scratch. Their job is impossible 
  with such a huge book with so many complex parameters and allegories. It is 
  not a history book though it records lots of history. It is not a book of law 
  though it deals with crime-punishment. It is not a mythology though it 
  mentions lots of myths. It is not a book of economics though it establishes 
  certain financial regulations. It is not a “Mohakabbyo” (what is the English 
  word of it?) though its poetic beauty and melody is<br>
  indisputable. It is a kind if its own. It cannot be read in the way all other 
  books are read.</p>
  <p>On the other hand it is enough for the critics to prove a single small hole 
  in the wall. That is like a fly in a bucket of milk. That is easy, especially 
  after all those thousands of killed Sahabis during the civil wars of Muslims 
  resulting in innumerable killed Sahabis/Muslims, burning “Gilaf”/broken wall 
  of the Kaba ( by Muslims), the cancelled Hajj from<br>
  1906 to 1911, genocide of 1971 in Bangladesh and Afghanistan today.</p>
