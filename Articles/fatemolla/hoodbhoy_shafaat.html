				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although I am yet to 
				read Dr. Hoodbhoy’s book and cannot relate it to 
				<a href="../hoodbhoy/book_review_islam_science.html">Dr. Ahmad Shafaat’s review</a> 
				of it, I am taking the opportunity to comment on some general 
				aspects of the review. Forceful, and probably correct in certain 
				sections, the review also seems quite misleading in some 
				aspects.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For starters: blindness 
				of “religious orthodoxy” is not an assumption, but hit and heat 
				of the day. A copy is blind by its attribute. Any religious 
				orthodoxy’s claim of “purity” of their interpretation of Islam 
				is but a copycat of a distant past. Inordinate amount of time, 
				energy, attention, devotion and other resources are spent 
				combing through volumes of information, only to confirm who did 
				what 1400 years ago. Those findings are imposed on us as Islam, 
				as if past people’s thought and behaviour, except Prophet’s 
				(SA), builds Islam. In that process personal choices and even 
				camel riding of the Prophet (SA) take the essence of Islamic 
				faith as Sunnah for some Muslims, so much so that even the water 
				of Jamjam and Arabian date offer some Sawab. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				About the Nobel Laureate Dr. Abdus Salam, suffice to say that a 
				fish can never understand a bird’s life. To experience an 
				inferno is quite different if being there and if watching it in 
				TV. When 15000 of one’s own people are butchered and raped in 
				three days (1953 Lahore, Pakistan), religious places are 
				destroyed and right of religion is abolished, the “grey area” 
				disappears and everything becomes black and white. Salam’s 
				“cure” of “the second class of ‘ulama`” is not easy. Maybe Dr. 
				Shafaat is able to prescribe one to develop a “not so hopeless” 
				tool to deal with the Saudi Chief-Educationist who claims 
				“Slavery is Islam’s part;” the Spanish Maolana’s book teaching 
				how to beat wives without leaving scars on their bodies; the 
				NWFP’s parliament-decision to ban women on TV/radio from 
				advertisement/singing/dancing; Dubai’s law of beating wives; 
				Malay-court’s acceptance of instant divorce by leaving message 
				in answering machine; French Maolana’s support of wife-beating 
				and <i>Raj’m</i>; Bangladesh-Maolanas’ roar of killing 
				university-professors; Sudan-parliament’s law of excluding women 
				from jobs that need gender-mixing, without keeping some jobs 
				only for women; UK-Maolanas’ declaration of Jihad and 
				celebration of 9/11 etcetera. Lest we forget human rights are 
				not negotiable, even in the name of Islam. Lest we forget human 
				rights don’t have to pass the test of scriptures. Rather, 
				scriptures have to pass the test of human rights. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We may not sweat our 
				heads for qualification of condemnation of takfir (a tool for 
				declaring others as Apostates?) because it is already qualified 
				by the holy Qura’an: see Suras Munafiqun 3, 4 – Tawbah 66, 78 - 
				Nahl 106 – Nisa 137, - and especially Yunus 99, plus by the 
				Prophet, see Sirat of Ibn Hisham/Ishaq page 667 and Sahi Bukhari 
				(of Muhsin khan, Medina Univ.) Vol 1 Hadiths 122, 130. Note that 
				the word “Ridda” (root-word of Murtaad) signifies a 
				self-inflicting act like “Suicide”; none from outside can do it. 
				Dr Shafaat concludes, “Hoodbhoy's perspective on &quot;Islam and 
				Science&quot; comes from a lost faith”. I don’t know if Dr. Hoodbhoy 
				declared his “lost faith” openly and clearly. If not, then Dr. 
				Shafaat missed the elemental conception of the Qura’anic 
				message, and Prophet’s examples shown above, by taking the 
				unIslamic authority to declare “lost faith” for others. This 
				practice of “Owning Islam” has caused immense bloodshed in 
				Muslim history and continuing, as the Jamat Chief of Bangladesh 
				declared on April 1 that criticizing Jamat tantamounts to 
				criticizing Islam. Both the Chief and Dr. Shafaat seem to have 
				missed the Islamic ethics that people’s lives and beliefs are 
				not anybody’s toys to play with, even in the name of Islam.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Shafaat asked - 
				“Does not a group, whether religious or secular have the right 
				to define itself”? No, if the group in question is named after 
				Islam, certain Qura’anic codes must be observed without 
				tampering. Those codes don’t have flexibility. Besides, the 
				world has the right and obligation to oppose it when an insane 
				group imposes its brutality on others. That is why we and good 
				people of other faiths screamed at burning widows in India; that 
				is why we and good people of other faiths scream about genocide 
				in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Gujarat and Bosnia. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not only Imam Hanbal 
				(assassinated) but also most of our Imams were tortured and 
				killed by political power. Imam Hanifa was imprisoned and 
				poisoned to death, Shafi’i was imprisoned, Malik’s hand was 
				severed in public, Taymiyah was imprisoned and killed, Bukhari 
				was sent to exile to die, et. al. Muslim history is filled with 
				heroes, villains and their hybrids; it is often difficult to 
				make clear demarcation between the persecutors and the 
				persecuted on the basis of ideology. Jamal and Siffin wars are 
				good examples. <br>
				Whether the great library of Alexandria was burnt by Omar (RA) 
				or by Christians may be debatable. But we cannot ignore our own 
				records. By referring to Muslim history I by no means demean our 
				second Khalifa, but stress on reconciling our contradictory 
				Islamic documents. An honest question has good merit. According 
				to Muslim history Omar was well-known for his hot temper. 
				Prophet’s acknowledgement about it is recorded in Sahi Bukhari; 
				for the same reason people objected to Abu Bakar when he 
				selected Omar as the next Khalifa. One may not like the 
				information, but documents say Omar effected the first selection 
				of Khalifa in a highly questionable manner (Sahi Bukhari, Tarikh 
				Al Tabari Vol X last pages and Vol XI pages 1–3). Islam was not 
				to be spread by sword; yet, without any provocation he invaded 
				Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Iran engendering genocides of 
				significance. He never punished Khalid Bin Walid for committing 
				genocide of 30, 000 people in Madhar, Iran, that earned the name 
				“Blood Canal” for big flow of human blood (Tabari Vol. 11, page 
				24) and 100,000 in Al Firad (Ibid, page 115). These I quoted 
				from THE earliest history of Muslims, as Dr. Shafaat stressed on 
				timeline being the yardstick of confidence on historical 
				documents. Tabari (839–923) recorded the history centuries 
				earlier than did Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406). </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				And what about the famous “Omar’s Pact” of 6 conditions that he 
				imposed on conquered Syrian non-Muslims? Non-Muslims were (1) 
				not to build monasteries, churches, convents, or monk’s shells, 
				and not to repair the existing ones; (2) not to teach the 
				Qura’an to their children; (3) not to manifest their religion 
				publicly or convert anyone but not stop anyone from embracing 
				Islam; (4) to rise from sits when a Muslim entered; (5) not to 
				resemble Muslims in names, garments or way of behaviour; and (6) 
				not to display their scriptures publicly – (“Islamic Roots of 
				Democratic Pluralism”-Dr. Abdulaziz Sachedina). Imam Shafi’i 
				used this document to prepare his own version that includes 
				wearing visible strap (and we blamed poor Talibans for imposing 
				the same on Afghan non-Muslims!). Also, Omar is recorded as not 
				giving a government job to the best candidate only because he 
				was non-Muslim, on the ground that “It would be a betrayal to 
				the Qura’an”.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				We can argue over these documents ad infinitum; yet the fact 
				remains it was Islamic Orthodoxy that not only generated 
				contradictory documents but also made some blunderous decisions. 
				A bright example thereof: “According to the Jurists the tolerant 
				verses are abrogated by the Sword Verse, Tawbah 29” – (Ibid, 
				page 48). The following quote is from page 1081 of “SUMMERIZED 
				SAHIH AL BUKHARI” By Al Imam Zain-Ud-Din Ahmad bin Abdul Lateef 
				Az-Zubaidi, translated by Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan, Islamic 
				University Al-Madina Al-Munawara. QUOTE: </font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Then after that He 
					made (Jihad) &quot;Fighting&quot; obligatory against all those who 
					fight you (Muslims). So Allah ordered: - And fight in the 
					way of Allah those who fight you..... (V 2:190). Then Allah 
					revealed in Sura Tawbah the order to discard (all) the 
					obligations (covenants etc.) and commanded the Muslims to 
					fight against all the Mushrikun as well as against people of 
					scriptures (Jews and Christians) if they do not embrace 
					Islam, till they pay Jizya with willing submission and feel 
					themselves subdued (as it is revealed in Verse 9:29). So 
					they (Muslims) were not permitted to abandon &quot;the fighting&quot; 
					against them (pagans, Jews and Christians) and to reconcile 
					with them and to suspend hostilities against them for an 
					unlimited periods while they are strong and are able to 
					fight against them (non-Muslims). ....As it is now obvious, 
					at first &quot;the fighting&quot; was forbidden, then it was permitted 
					and after that it was made obligatory - (1) against them who 
					start &quot;the fighting against you (Muslims)&quot; (2) and against 
					all those who worship others along with Allah - as mentioned 
					in Sura Bakarah, Al-Imran and Tauba and other Sura. 
					-UNQUOTE. </font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus orthodox Islam 
				declared a permanent informal war against world’s non-Muslims. 
				In reality of this, how we can claim Islam as a religion of 
				peace. In the current version the paragraph is reported to have 
				been taken out for obvious reason. Sanitation continues with 
				Imam Ghazali as well in recent editions, especially in parts 
				dealing with women’s rights. What does it tell us? Dr. Shafaat 
				often refers to Western scholars (that we habitually condemn) 
				but conveniently bypasses our own documents, such as 
				Bukhari-Muslim-Masnad-Muatta-Tirmidhi-Abu Dawood-Nisa’i, Tarikh 
				Al Tabari, Sirat (Ibn Hisham/Ishaq), Maghadi of Wakidi, Tabaquat 
				of Ibn Sa’ad, etc that are among the earliest of Islamic 
				records. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				Next let’s review Dr. Shafaat’s opinion about Imam Ghazali, 
				whose specialty was multi-nested classifications of conceptual 
				phenomena such as Ilm, Akidah, education, soul, worship, 
				devotion, and Sawab, etc., which cannot be either proven or 
				unproven. This is by no means to denounce the respected Imam but 
				to consider him a fallible human scholar, not a divine entity. 
				Dr. Shafaat’s comment: “a large number of other statements by 
				al-Ghazali that point in the other direction” clearly show 
				serious self-contradiction of the Imam. He also comments: 
				“al-Ghazali had a similar criticism for sciences of Shariah” and 
				“He went through an agonizing ordeal in search of truth”. Next 
				it seems that, in the end, Ghazali’s “Truth” leads Muslims to 
				serious violation of human rights in unacceptability of 
				non-Muslim doctors’ witness, in cases of medical legalities (Ulum 
				Al Deen, Vol. 1) and, in Vol. 1: “A wife goes into slavery of 
				her husband after marriage,” “A wife’s gratitude to her husband 
				cannot be fulfilled even if the husband’s body is covered with 
				pus and the wife licks it”, - “A husband is owner, so he has to 
				be concerned about the subjects, women”, - “One has to divorce 
				his wife if his father dislikes her” …indeed a long list. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				We don’t accept this violence towards our women. Yet for far too 
				long we have been inspired by our Ghazalis, playing gods in our 
				women’s lives in the name of Islam. It must end now. Here are 
				some more: </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">FROM VINNOMOT.COM: - The 
				Ashariyya led by Ghazali and Rumi rejected the rationalists 
				Mutazilis whom, in their view, had forsaken religion and had 
				detracted from God and his revelation. Thus rational objectivism 
				was quashed, the books of rationalists such as Zakaria Razi were 
				destroyed and they themselves had to hide for their safety. Thus 
				most likely the Islamic Renascence that was about to be born 
				1000 years ago did not. We shall never know the extent of the 
				harm that these celebrated religious zealots caused to mankind’s 
				civilization. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Shaffiee Kadkani 
				wrote: “If it wasn’t because of Ashariyya our history might have 
				evolved differently”. [Creation and History, (Afarinesh VA 
				Tarikh, p.50) - Massoume Price). When Ibn Khadon in his 
				‘Introduction (Mogadameh) mentioned that Africans are black 
				because of geographical and environmental conditions, it was the 
				Ashariyya who ended such scientific observations by declaring 
				people are black because God created them as such. When 
				Physicians tried to find the connection between the brain and 
				hand’s movements, it was Ghazali who mocked scientific inquiry 
				and stated “hands move because God wants them to move” (Alchemy 
				of Happiness, Kimiyaya Saadat). </font>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Shafaat did not 
				disclose that, although the Imam described mathematics and 
				medicine as Fard-E Kefaya, (Ibid, Vol, 1) he decisively placed 
				those as secondary to religious-Ilm. Thus Ghazali needlessly 
				made one branch of knowledge compete with another. He subtly 
				glorifies poverty in the name of worship; see bellow. Following 
				are quotes from pages 36 - 37 of “Criminals of Islam” - By 
				Shabbir Ahmed M.D. referring to Ghazali’s famous book Ehyaul 
				Ulum - “THE RENAISSANCE OF ALL KNOWLEDGE” (Ahmed says the name 
				should have been “THE DEMISE OF COMMON SENSE”).</font></p>

					</font></li>
				</ul>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We can indeed continue 
				about the Imam. A champion of revelation over reason and a 
				mesmerizing orator, he killed the Mutazilite’s approach of 
				rationality and virtually blocked Ijtihad. But we should be more 
				concerned with not what the Imam said, but with his impact on 
				Muslim-society. About the mystic Dr. Iqbal mentioned in Dr. 
				Shafaat’s article I want to add one unrelated fact. As the 
				President of All India Muslim League Conference in Allahabad in 
				1939, he for the first time formally adopted the conception of a 
				sovereign Muslim country in free India, (for prosperity of 
				Indian Muslims) but in his plan for areas of that dream-country 
				he did not include Bengal, where 39% of Indian Muslims lived. 
				Probably a human error impacting millions; no pun intended to 
				the close-to-heart mystic poet. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				About secular humanism for social governance, Dr. Shafaat makes 
				several comments:</font></p>
				<blockquote>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
					“The author seems unable to admit the possibility that 
					religion might be able to provide a better alternative to 
					secular humanism”…. “As for the list of the bloody battles 
					in which followers of various religions have been involved, 
					certainly secularism has not prevented people from similarly 
					bloody wars”. … “Well, many religious groups also claim that 
					if a true form of their religion was in practice somewhere 
					they will not do some of the wrong things that they now do”… 
					“There is here the same &quot;absolute belief&quot; in the 
					&quot;superiority&quot; of secular humanism that religions are 
					criticized for.” </font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My comment: Religions 
				have had a very long time to prove their worth in social 
				governance. Human experience of god’s law is extremely scary, to 
				say the least. Memories of European Church-states, Indian Temple 
				states and violation of human rights by Sharia the so-called 
				Allah’s Law that violates the Qura’an and justice still chill 
				our spines. We don’t want to play that losing game anymore. With 
				so many religions around, secularism is not a choice but 
				mandatory in today’s world. True that through secular democracy 
				we saw rising demons in the shape of the foreign policies of the 
				USA and UK. But it is likely it can be worked out. The concept 
				of secularism is relatively new. For centuries we experimented 
				with tribalism, feudalism, communism etc. to get here. 
				Secularism must be allowed time to come of age. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Secular humanism may not 
				be the only way but religious theocracy is certainly not any way 
				at all. One may wonder how Dr. Shafaat missed the big difference 
				between &quot;absolute belief&quot; in the &quot;superiority&quot; of secular 
				humanism and &quot;absolute belief&quot; in the &quot;superiority&quot; of 
				religions. The former is by the people, of the people and for 
				the people--to create and update social rules according to 
				changed circumstances. On the other hand “absolute belief&quot; in 
				the &quot;superiority&quot; of religions is the property of few clergies, 
				who claim to represent the will of Allah. Normally those 
				clergies are void of poetic approach to life, valuing scriptural 
				letters over human life. Muslim countries are in general 
				illiterate; people are mortgaged to clergies so despicably that, 
				even after realizing the atrocities in Islam’s name, they are 
				not allowed to question it. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rationally we can’t 
				afford to allow it because no human institution can claim to 
				represent Allah’s wish on earth. A secular state permits people 
				of all religions to practice their religion in safety and 
				harmony, with special privileges for, and discrimination 
				against, none. From this comparative it is fundamentally 
				different from all major religions, in not wishing to impose its 
				worldview on every individual. <br>
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Shafaat concluded 
				with -“Islamic civilization, after its present ruin, will once 
				again vibrate with life as an authentically Islamic 
				civilization, not only overcoming some of its deep problems but 
				also guiding humanity to a vastly better alternative to the 
				existing world order”. What he missed is that a civilization 
				that can flourish and decline cannot be “Islamic” because by 
				calling it Islamic we run the risk of defaming Islam when the 
				civilization collapses. Human civilizations are not consequences 
				of faith-systems; those have existed with or without faith. Even 
				Islam’s enemy Firaun created one of the greatest civilizations 
				that built the wonderful Pyramids. But does it make his ideology 
				better than Islam’s? A civilization can be human or even Muslim, 
				but surely it can’t be an Islamic civilization. Islam is about 
				moral guidance; it’s not about birthing civilizations. Islam is 
				complete with or without, before or after any civilization. By 
				claims of “Islamic Civilization” we inadvertently encourage 
				Christians and Jews to claim the present civilization to be 
				“Christian” or “Judeo-Christian”. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><br>
				<font face="Verdana">Dreams are life’s driving forces. It is 
				good to have a dream. But the super-dream “Islam wants to 
				eliminate all other governments from the face of the planet and 
				establish the power of Islam in their stead” (Jihad in Islam – 
				Mawdudi, page 6) is not “guiding humanity.” Rather, it is 
				suicidal for Muslims and a threat to humankind. </font></p>

				Salaam to all. </font></p>
