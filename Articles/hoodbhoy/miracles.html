  On the morning of the first Gulf War (1991), having just heard the news of the 
  US attack on Baghdad, I walked into my office in the physics department in a 
  state of numbness and depression. Mass death and devastation would surely 
  follow. I was dismayed, but not surprised, to discover my PhD student, a 
  militant activist of the Jamaat-i-Islami’s student wing in Islamabad, in a 
  state of euphoria. Islam’s victory, he said, is inevitable because God is on 
  our side and the Americans cannot survive without alcohol and women. He 
  reasoned that neither would be available in Iraq, and happily concluded that 
  the Americans were doomed. Then he reverentially closed his eyes and thrice 
  repeated “<i>Inshallah</i>” (if Allah so wills). Two weeks later, after the 
  rout of Saddam’s army and 70,000 dead Iraqis, I reminded him of his 
  predictions. He stumbled an explanation but soon gave up. Years later, soon 
  after earning a reasonably good doctorate in quantum field theory and 
  elementary particles, he quit academia and put his considerable physics skills 
  to use in a very different direction. Today he heads a department that deals 
  with missile guidance systems in a defense organization that makes nuclear 
  weapons and precision missiles.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  Belief in miracles, and that ones’ prayers can persuade divine intervention in 
  matters of the physical world, is an integral part of most cultures and 
  beliefs. In Pakistan today – where the bulk of the population has been through 
  the Islamized education initiated by General Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980’s – 
  supernatural intervention is widely held responsible for natural calamities 
  and diseases, car accidents and plane crashes, acquiring or losing personal 
  wealth, success or failure in examinations, or determining matters of love and 
  matrimony. In Pakistan no aircraft – whether of Pakistan International 
  Airlines or a private carrier registered in Pakistan – can take off until 
  appropriate prayers are recited. Wars certainly cannot be won without Allah’s 
  help, but He has also been given the task of winning cricket matches for 
  Pakistan.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  The last mentioned is serious business, lest anyone think otherwise. And it 
  makes the Almighty’s job a particularly difficult one whenever there are 
  Muslims playing on the other sides’ team. Hafizur Rahman, an astute observer 
  of Pakistani cricket, recalls that when the Pakistan team won a test match in 
  South Africa some years ago, to the amazement of the spectators, all team 
  members prostrated themselves on the cricket ground to thank Allah. But this 
  was a minor event compared to the national frenzy induced by the World Cup in 
  Australia; the erstwhile prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, called upon the 
  entire nation to pray for a final win. Even the clergy, who normally condemn 
  cricket as frivolous entertainment, joined in the hysteria. When Pakistan lost 
  the match, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who became prime minister in 2004, had an 
  interesting explanation. In his view, “the PTV (Pakistan Television) song that 
  boasted that we would win, did not contain the word <i>Inshallah</i>. That is 
  why we lost.”</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  Drought may not be as important a matter as cricket, but last week the 
  government of Pakistan issued a warning – the rivers are running dry, water 
  reservoirs are nearing the danger mark, and hydro-electricity production may 
  soon be discontinued. Even as I type this paragraph on a Friday afternoon, 
  millions of the faithful in mosques across Pakistan are obeying the 
  government’s call for ‘<i>namaz-i-istisqa</i>’ (prayers for rain). Next year – 
  instead of building dams, lining canals, embarking on water conservancy 
  strategies, or doing something to control Pakistan’s exploding population – 
  the government will presumably put the pressure on God again by summoning the 
  masses.</p>

  <b>Will It Rain If You Pray?</b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  The history of myths and miracles in pre-Reformation Christianity, of their 
  growth in earlier phases, and their decline under Renaissance thinking, is an 
  extremely interesting and relevant subject for those who wish to understand 
  the state of science and society in Muslim countries today. The fundamental 
  question then was, and remains today, the following: does God suspend the laws 
  of physics in response to the actions of human beings (in which case miracles
  <i>can</i> happen)? Or has God turned over the day-to-day matters of running 
  the universe to the laws of physics that he put into place at the beginning 
  (in this case miracles <i>cannot</i> happen)? </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  Following the lead of European Renaissance thinkers, Muslim reformers of the 
  19<sup>th</sup> century, particularly Syed Ahmad Khan, argued that miracles – 
  as commonly understood – cannot and do not happen. As a religious scholar who 
  wrote a <i>tafseer</i> (interpretation) of the Qur’an, Syed Ahmad Khan 
  insisted that the miracles mentioned in the Qur’an must be understood in broad 
  allegorical terms rather than literally. Following the Mutazillite tradition 
  of early Islam he, together with various 19<sup>th</sup> century Arab 
  modernists, insisted on an interpretation of the Qur’an that was in conformity 
  with the observed truths of science, thereby doing away with such commonly 
  held beliefs as the Noah’s Great Flood and Adam’s descent from heaven. It was 
  a risky proposition that brought them closer to modern scientific thought, on 
  the one hand, and severe condemnation from the orthodox of those times. But 
  those 19<sup>th</sup> century battles appear to be forgotten today. Looking at 
  these old writings, one wonders how those Muslim thinkers dared to engage so 
  boldly in such controversial matters. But they did, and today we dare not. 
  This is an indication of the profound philosophical and intellectual 
  regression of the Muslim world over the last two centuries.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  My discussion in a recent seminar in Lahore of the history of miracles, 
  cause-and-effect in ancient Islam (there was greater acceptance then than 
  today!), and description of rainfall as a physical process that cannot be 
  influenced by prayer, drew an angry reaction from a professor at an elite 
  university. Subsequently, an email was circulated to the entire student body 
  and beyond, an excerpt of which is reproduced below:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">&nbsp;</p>

inter-ideograph"><i>The fact that rainfall sometimes is caused in response to 
  prayers is a matter of human experience. Although I cannot narrate an incident 
  directly, I know [this] from the observations of people who would not 
  exaggerate…. . The problem is that Dr Hoodbhoy has narrowed down his mind to 
  be influenced by only those facts that could be explained by the 
  cause-and-effect relationship. That's a classic example of academic 
  prejudice…. Our world is not running on the principle of a causal 
  relationship. It is running the way it is being run by its Master. Man has 
  discovered that, generally speaking, the physical phenomena of our world 
  follow the principle of cause-and-effect. However, that may not always happen, 
  because the One who is running it has never committed Himself to stick to that 
  principle.</i></p>

  <span style="font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></span>Prof. X admits that he has never personally witnessed rain fall 
  in consequence to prayers, but confidently states that this is ‘a matter of 
  human experience’ because he thinks some others have seen unusual things 
  happen. Well, there are people who are willing to swear on oath that they have 
  seen Elvis’s ghost. Others claim that they have seen UFOs, horned beasts, 
  apparitions, the dead arise, etc. Without disputing that some of these people 
  might be sincere and honest, I must emphasise that science cannot agree to 
  this methodology. There is no limit to the power of people’s imagination. 
  Unless these mysterious events are recorded on camera, we cannot accept them 
  as factual occurrences. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">
  <span style="font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></span>Rain is a physical process (evaporation, cloud formation, 
  nucleation, condensation). It is complicated, because the atmospheric motion 
  of gases needs many variables for a proper description.&nbsp; However, it obeys 
  exactly the same physical laws as deduced by looking at gases in a cylinder, 
  falling bodies, and so forth. Personally I would be most interested to know 
  whether prayers can also cause the reversal of much simpler kinds of physical 
  processes. For example, can a stone be made to fall upward instead of 
  downward? Or can heat be made to flow from a cold body to a hot body by 
  appropriate spiritual prompting?&nbsp; If prayers can cause rain to fall from a 
  blue sky, then all physics and all science deserves to be trashed.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">
  <span style="font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></span>I am afraid that the track record for Prof. X’s point of view on 
  rain is not very good. Saudi Arabia remains a desert in spite of its evident 
  holiness, and the poor peasants of Sind have a terrible time with drought in 
  spite of their simplicity and piety. Geography, not earnestness of prayer, 
  appears to be the determining factor.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">
  <span style="font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></span>Confidence in the cause-and-effect relationship is indeed the 
  very foundation of science and, as a scientist, I fully stand by it. Press the 
  letter ‘T’ on your keyboard and the same letter appears on the screen; step on 
  the accelerator and your car accelerates; jump out of a window and you get 
  hurt; put your hand on a stove and you get burnt. Those who doubt 
  cause-and-effect do so at great personal peril.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: -.25in; margin-left: .75in">
  <span style="font-family: Symbol">·<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></span>Prof. X is correct in saying that many different people (not 
  just Muslims alone) believe they can influence physical events through 
  persuading a divine authority. Indeed, in the specific context of rain-making, 
  we have several examples. Red Indians had their very elaborate dances to 
  please the Rain God; people of the African bush tribes beat drums and chant; 
  and orthodox Hindus plead with Ram through spectacular ‘yagas’ with hundreds 
  of thousands of the faithful. Their methods seem a little odd to me, but I 
  wonder if Prof. X wishes to accord them respect and legitimacy. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <b>Why Science Does Matter</b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  Specious theological beliefs, together with reliance on miracles and 
  superstitions, have acted as a brake on social progress and often rendered 
  peoples vulnerable to the depredations of science-based imperialism. Muslims 
  have been the worst sufferers.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  Suffocated by Western colonizers on the one hand, and the weight of tradition 
  on the other, 19<sup>th</sup> century Muslim modernizers across the Muslim 
  world sought new ways to revive their societies. Reconciling Islamic theology 
  with science was an important challenge because, for these pioneering 
  individuals, science was the key instrument for promoting rational thinking on 
  political and social matters. Mohammed Abduh, Rashid Rida, Jamaluddin Afghani, 
  Syed Ameer Ali, Syed Ahmad Khan, and other intellectuals, sought to deal with 
  issues such as polygamy and purdah in Islam, the question of slavery, the 
  permissibility of interest, etc. Their success – limited as it was – was 
  important in eventually creating a large Muslim elite that broke with 
  traditional norms and forms of social behaviour. </p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  But today Islam is once again regressing into pre-scientific thinking and 
  behaviour – thousands of websites on science and Islam promote the most 
  egregious examples of scientific crackpotism. But Muslims are not alone. A 
  similar regression is evident on a global scale with anti-scientific thinking 
  neatly dovetailing with, and providing justification for, aggressive forms of 
  social and political behaviour. </p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  This primitivism is starkly evident in George Bush’s America which promotes 
  Creationism and Christian notions of the human foetus. According to the 
  National Science Foundation's biennial report (April 2002) on the state of 
  science understanding: 30% of adult Americans believe that UFOs are space 
  vehicles from other civilizations; 60% believe in ESP; 40% think that 
  astrology is scientific; 32% believe in lucky numbers; 70% accept magnetic 
  therapy as scientific; and 88% accept alternative medicine. This vast base of 
  ignorance allows for the rise of American neoconservatism and the blueprint 
  for the New American Century; preparations for Armageddon; and for General 
  Boykin in Somalia to say “my God is bigger than theirs”. </p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">In 
  India, superstitious beliefs were actively cultivated by the BJP and its 
  allies. These included the creation of astrology departments, promotion of 
  “Vedic” mathematics and cosmology, and a revamping of the school curricula. 
  Mass hysteria – promoted by orthodox Hindus – accompanied the sighting of the 
  “Monkey Man”, followed by Muhnochwa the “Face-Scratcher”, and then the 
  elephant-like Lord Ganesh’s alleged drinking of milk. Charged with the notion 
  of Hindu superiority, and of wild notions that Hindu deities had been born 
  under certain mosques, Hindutva forces organized the razing of mosques and 
  tombs, and massacred Muslims and Christians. </p>
  <p class="MsoTitle" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">In 
  Israel, orthodox Jews have been the pillars of a state that is built on the 
  notion of religious exclusion. Israel’s drive for total military superiority, 
  and a strong tradition of Jewish secularism, have so far kept the orthodox at 
  bay. But it is unclear whether this can persist indefinitely. For example, 
  certain American cattle tycoons have for years been working with Israeli 
  counterparts to try and breed a pure red heifer in Israel, which, by their 
  interpretation of chapter 19 of the Book of Numbers, will signal the coming of 
  the building of the Third Temple. If they were to succeed, it could intensify 
  the already strong movement within Israel to rebuild the Temple, the event of 
  which would ignite the Middle East, as any new Temple must be built on the 
  Temple Mount current home of the Dome of The Rock, a Muslim holy site.<span style="color:black">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  <span style="color:black">Zealots of all persuasions – Muslim, Hindu, 
  Christian, and Jewish – welcome attacks on science and reason. Social 
  constructivists, postmodernists, and even some feminists, have unwittingly 
  given them yet more ammunition by inventing specious arguments. Improvement of 
  the human condition demands a return to critical reasoning and scientific 
  analysis, a rejection of cultural relativism, and willingness to accept 
  still-evolving universal norms of ethics and human behaviour. </span></p>
