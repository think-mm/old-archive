				In this book, Dr. Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist, eloquently and 
				usefully draws attention to the plight of science and technology 
				in the Muslim world and to the need to do something about it. 
				The book also makes some other helpful insights here and there 
				about why, after centuries of brilliant achievements, science 
				suffered such a fate in the Muslim world. But the book also 
				suffers from some very serious flaws in its view of Islam and 
				analysis of Islamic history.&nbsp;</p>

				<b><span style="font-size: 16pt">VILIFICATION OF “RELIGIOUS 
				ORTHODOXY”</span></b>&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				To begin with the book shows insufficient appreciation of the 
				fact that rationality and irrationality are almost always found 
				together in every culture or group or individual, from Nobel 
				laureate scientists to man on the street and therefore 
				rationality has to battle within each of them. Failing to do 
				justice to this self-evident fact, the author makes a sharp, 
				almost black-and-white distinction between two tendencies in 
				Islamic history, one irrational and represented by the 
				“religious orthodoxy” and the other rational and represented by 
				philosophers and scientists.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				The tone for this outlook is set first in the subtitle of the 
				book and then in the foreword, written by Prof. Abdus Salam, the 
				renowned physicist. The subtitle, “Religious Orthodoxy and the 
				Battle for Rationality”, assumes that religious orthodoxy is a 
				blind force committed against rationality and is something to be 
				battled. We are not told what defines “religious orthodoxy”, but 
				it seems that for the author it means religious beliefs and 
				practices taught by the ‘ulama` (religious scholars), including 
				those that are also found in the teachings of the Prophet and 
				his companions.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				When we move from the title to the foreword, we find Salam 
				condemning the ‘ulama` without mercy and without any 
				qualifications. Although this review is about Hoodbhoy’a book, 
				yet because of the stature of Salam as a physicist and the 
				weight that some people might give to his views, it seems 
				worthwhile to examine the foreword in some detail.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Salam divides the ‘ulama` into two categories. “First, there are 
				the lay preachers whose major task is to lead prayers in the 
				rural mosques and who earn their living by performing such 
				functions as officiating marriage, death, and circumcision 
				ceremonies and looking after the upkeep of the mosques.” With 
				undisguised disdain the Nobel laureate suggests the following 
				way to deal with them: “This is a professional class who should 
				have scant interest in fundamentalist persecution once their 
				livelihood is secured. If this can be guaranteed them … they 
				would not retard the progress of science and technology.” What a 
				brilliant solution! Classes that retard progress should be 
				guaranteed livelihood so that other classes may be encouraged to 
				retard progress!&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				“The second class of ‘ulama` is the damaging one. These are men 
				(without spiritual pretensions) who claim to interpret the Holy 
				Qur`an, issue excommunication fatwas&nbsp; …&nbsp; and give their view on 
				all subjects – politics, economics, law – in their Friday 
				sermons. … The arrogance, the rapacity, and the low level of 
				common sense displayed by this class, as well as its tolerance, 
				has been derided by all poets and writers of any consequence in 
				Persia, India, Central Asia, and Turkey.” For this second 
				category of ‘ulama, Salam suggests no brilliant solutions. 
				Apparently, their case is hopeless.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Salam makes <i>takfir</i> (which he translates as 
				excommunication and means declaring someone a non-believer or 
				outside the fold of Islam) as the starting point of his analysis 
				of what is wrong with the Muslim world and what to do about the 
				promotion of science and technology there. Like the ‘ulama`, he 
				condemns <i>takfir</i> without any qualifications. “What is the 
				remedy that <i>takfir</i> does not recur”? <i>Takfir</i> is 
				viewed here as bad without any exceptions. Yet is this position 
				rational? Does not a group, whether religious or secular have 
				the right to define itself? Can we not form a group by setting a 
				basis in belief and practice for membership. And can we then not 
				expel those members who have radically departed from that basis? 
				A negative answer to these questions is the presupposition of 
				Salam’s comments, which is clearly irrational. Indeed, <i>takfir</i> 
				is not too different from Salam’s decision not to write a 
				foreword for Hoodboy’s book (p. ix) if it did not agree with his 
				views. Nobody can object to the condition that Salam imposed for 
				writing the foreword. Similarly, no body can object to the right 
				of a group to impose certain conditions for membership in it.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				The disgust with which Salam treats a whole class of people and 
				his categorical and unqualified rejection of the very idea of <i>
				takfir</i> is not understandable on any rational grounds. But it 
				begins to make sense once we keep in mind that Salam belongs to 
				the Qadiyani sect which is one of the very few sects, if not the 
				only one, that Muslims have, with a level of unanimity rarely 
				achieved in Islamic history, declared outside the fold of Islam. 
				This makes him lose sight of two very obvious facts: 1) groups 
				do have the right to decide what they stand for and insist that 
				people either subscribe to their foundational principles or 
				leave; and 2) a whole class of people cannot be so uniformly 
				disgusting as Salam makes the ‘ulama` to be.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				The vilification of the ‘ulama` started in the foreword by Salam 
				is continued in the book by Hoodbhoy, although while Salam 
				demonizes the ‘ulama because they declared the Qadiyani sect to 
				be outside the fold of Islam, Hoodbhoy’s motivation comes from a 
				negative attitude towards religion itself.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Hoodboy presents as “heroes” (p. 107) some Muslim scientists and 
				philosophers who supposedly held very unconventional views about 
				Islam such as al-Kindi, al-Razi, Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, and Ibn 
				Khaldun while he turns other brilliant leaders and thinkers such 
				as ‘Umar bin al-Khattab and al-Ghazali into villains. This 
				strict division between villains and heroes, as is often the 
				case, proves to be mistaken under scrutiny. Thus one “orthodox 
				villain” Ibn Taymiyyah considered another “orthodox villain” 
				al-Ghazali as misguided. Similarly, Ibn Khaldun, one of 
				Hoodbhoy’s heroes, condemns another of his heroes Ibn Sina as 
				anti-religious. Furthermore, if “villains” like al-Ghazali seem 
				to discourage the study of some sciences, then so do “heroes” 
				like Ibn Khaldun who opposed the science of chemistry and Ibn 
				Rushd who said: “books written by scholars should be forbidden 
				to the ordinary person by the rulers.”&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Likewise, there is no clear demarcation between the persecutors 
				and the persecuted on the basis of ideology. Both the “orthodox” 
				and the “rationalists” could be persecuted or be the persecutors 
				if circumstances so conspired. Thus Hoodbhoy’s villains suffered 
				some hardships as did his heroes. The rationalists Mu‘tazilites 
				were in power when the “orthodox” Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal and 
				others were tortured for their views on the nature of the Qur`an 
				and eventually killed. Later, the “orthodox” were in power and 
				they seized one Abd al-Sallam in whose house were found books on 
				philosophy, witchcraft, astrology, cults of the stars, and 
				prayers addressed to the planets. At least the orthodox did not 
				physically torture him, much less kill him. They simply burnt 
				the books in his possession and cursed in public those who wrote 
				them or believed in them. What is most interesting is that Imam 
				Ibn Hanbal was also cursed because Abd al-Sallam was his 
				grandson and was regarded as one of his disciples. That Ahmad 
				ibn Hanbal could be considered a teacher of a philosopher with 
				books on witchcraft and worship of the stars and then could be 
				cursed by the “orthodox” shows how blurred were the distinctions 
				between the “orthodox” and the “rationalist heretics”. Also, 
				without doubt many of Hoodbhoy’s heroic philosophers and 
				scientists would have agreed with their “villainous orthodox” 
				counterparts in rejecting astrology, witchcraft, worship of 
				stars and planets.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				But Hoodbhoy’s book <u>has</u> to sharpen the distinction 
				between the “orthodox” and the “rationalists” to the point of 
				making it black and white. Having no original approach in his 
				analysis of Islamic history, he simply sees it in terms of the 
				conflict in Western history between the Chruch and science and 
				between the Chruch and the state. Since in Islam there is no 
				central organized authority comparable to the Church 
				establishment, something like the “religious orthodoxy” had to 
				be given the place of the church in order to force the model of 
				Christian history on to the Islamic history. Likewise, since 
				over against this “religious orthodoxy” there were no scientists 
				in clear opposition, he has to pick some Muslim philosophers and 
				scientists as heroes comparable to Galileo and other European 
				scientists. And since the diagnosis of the problem is imported 
				from the West, then the solution also comes from there. As we 
				shall see, the solution according to the author is secularism, 
				separation of religion and state.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				In order to paint a negative image of the “religious orthodoxy” 
				Hoodbhoy lists a number of incidents that supposedly establish 
				such an image (p. 95-107). We have already referred to one such 
				incident, that involving Abd al-Sallam. As we have seen this 
				incident only points to the difficulty of sharply distinguishing 
				the orthodox from other Muslims. Another incident mentioned is 
				about “the orthodox sultan, Khawarism Shah.” When a word was 
				brought to him of a land of the midnight sun, the sultan 
				regarded the report as pure heresy, for if such information were 
				accurate it would put into question the prayer times. Later, the 
				sultan accepted the report when the well-known Muslim scientist, 
				Al-Biruni, who then lived at the court of the sultan, assured 
				him of its accuracy. Now, we may ask: where, in this story, is 
				that blind force of irrationality that the orthodox are supposed 
				as a rule to manifest and which rationality has to battle? We 
				can accuse the sultan of limited intelligence or of rushing to 
				judgment -- by no means rare human qualities in any time, place, 
				and group -- but there is no blind opposition to rationality 
				here. The sultan keeps company with the likes of al-Biruni and 
				when the great man of learning explains the matter to him, he 
				listens to reason.</p>

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Another example of the blindness of the religious orthodoxy is a 
				tradition about ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, one of the towering 
				figures of human history. Hoodbhoy taints the name of ‘Umar by 
				quoting the tradition that when Muslims conquered Persia their 
				commander Sa‘d bin Abi Waqqas came across a very large number of 
				books. He asked ‘Umar what to do about these books and received 
				the reply: “Throw them in the water. If what they contain is 
				right guidance, God has given us better guidance. If it is 
				error, God has protected us against it.” The tradition is quoted 
				as part of the examples on p. 95-107 of the blindness of the 
				“religious orthodoxy”.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Hoodbhoy clearly does not know that this tradition is a total 
				fabrication and that it is <u>known as such to scholars, both 
				Muslims and non-Muslims</u>. The story is first mentioned by Ibn 
				Khaldun (1332-1406), that is, seven centuries after the time of 
				‘Umar. We have an earlier story, but this one is not about 
				throwing in the water a large number of books in Iran but 
				burning by fire a similarly large number in Alexandria, Egypt. 
				The earliest mention of this Alexandrian version of the story is 
				also late, about six centuries after the time of ‘Umar. During 
				these six centuries voluminous books of history were written not 
				only by Muslims but also by Christians and Jews. Yet not a hint 
				of burning of any library in any land conquered under ‘Umar is 
				found in any of these books, not even those written by Ibn 
				Khaldun, who mentions it in his sociological work, 
				al-Muqaddimah. Moreover, there is evidence that the Alexandrian 
				library was destroyed earlier by Christians before Islam and in 
				the time of ‘Umar there was no library in the Egyptian city to 
				burn! The legendary character of the story is so obvious that 
				any writer who has some academic standing and has examined the 
				story from a historical point of view has rejected it, including 
				Gibbon, Butler, Victor Chauvin, Paul Casanova, Eugenio Griffini, 
				Carlyle, Hector, Renan, Sedillot, Devanport, Gustav Lebon, Will 
				Durant, Bernard Lewis, Shibli Nu‘mani, and the Iranian scholar 
				Murtada Mutahhari. Had Hoodbhoy examined the reliability of this 
				report in anything like a scientific spirit, he would have 
				quickly discovered the above mentioned facts and reached the 
				obvious conclusion that the story has no basis in historical 
				fact.</p>

				<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				If Hoodbhoy never suspected anything wrong in a report casting 
				aspersion on a person like ‘Umar, although even a Christian 
				writer in the 17<sup>th</sup> century wrote that the report does 
				not ring true (Eusèbe Renaudot, <i>History of the Patriarchs of 
				Alexandria</i>), then it is only to be expected that Hoodbhoy 
				would jump on any words of lesser representatives of the 
				“religious orthodoxy” if they would paint them as blind. For 
				this crime of religious orthodoxy,&nbsp; Hoodbhoy singles out 
				al-Ghazali as the worst culprit. In doing so he uses English 
				translation of the German translation by Goldziher of the Arabic 
				works, and possibly also that Orientalist’s analysis. It is well 
				known that Goldziher at times misunderstood Arabic texts he 
				used. A well known example is a text by al-Zuhri which Goldziher 
				misinterpreted to mean that al-Zuhri admitted fabricating hadith 
				in order to please the rulers.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				More importantly, Hoodbhoy quotes only the passages where 
				al-Ghazali seems to discourage the study of science and 
				philosophy. Violating basic principle of rational scientific 
				inquiry, he completely ignores a large number of other 
				statements by al-Ghazali that point in the other direction, 
				e.g.&nbsp;</p>

				rejected scientific propositions of the philosophers even when 
				those propositions were true, simply because some of their other

				(non-Shari‘ah sciences). To the latter belongs mathematics and 
				medicine, which he describes as praiseworthy sciences.&nbsp; They are 
				considered <i>far<u>d</u> kif</i>a<i>yah</i>, that is, it is a 
				collective obligation of the Muslims to train enough members of 
				the community with expertise in these fields so that the needs 
				of the Islamic society are fulfilled. This implies that every 
				Muslim would be committing a sin if there was a shortage of 
				experts in these sciences. To be sure, in the same book, 
				al-Ghazali also criticized unnecessary studies in mathematics 
				that do not have practical applications. But clearly we have to 
				understand the two positions in the light of each other. It 
				should also be noted that al-Ghazali had a similar criticism for 
				sciences of Shariah. Thus he blamed the students of 
				jurisprudence for their indulgence in minute details of the 
				Shari`ah. The context indicates that according to al-Ghazali it 
				would be better to study medicine instead of specializing in 
				issues in jurisprudence that might never prove to be of any 
				benefit. In a later book, <i>al-Mustasfa min `Ilm al-Usul</i>, 
				al-Ghazali seems to be much more negative towards mathematical 
				fields (arithmetic and geometry). But this is probably a case of 
				an author going too far in expressing one concern – in this case 
				a concern to warn against certain false teachings of the 
				philosophers – at the expense of other concerns.</p>

				</span>Al-Ghazali’s criticism of the philosophers is not a 
				criticism of rationality, for he himself uses the rational 
				method in the criticism. He wrote two books to refute the 
				philosophers: <i>Maqasid al-Falasifah</i> (The Aims of the 
				Philosophers) and <i>Tahafut al-Falasifah</i> (The Incoherence 
				of the Philosophers).&nbsp; In the first book he objectively set down 
				what Muslim philosophers were saying in his time. As he himself 
				says: “I thought that I should introduce, prior to the <i>
				Tahafut</i>, a concise account that will include the story of 
				their aims (<i>maqasid</i>) which will be derived from their 
				logical, natural and metaphysical sciences, without 
				distinguishing between what is right and what is wrong, without 
				additions and along with what they believed as their proofs.” (<i>Maqasid</i>, 
				p. 31) This conscious attempt to present an objective account of 
				the thought of adversaries is more rational than Hoodbhoy’s 
				biased and selective representation of al-Ghazali’s thought. It 
				was followed by the <i>Tahafut</i>, which subject the views of 
				the philosophers to logical criticism within a set of shared 
				assumptions.</p>

				5)<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-family: Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</span>Al-Ghazali is aware that there are more sciences within 
				reach of human beings than existed in his time. “It appeared to 
				me through clear insight and beyond doubt, that man is capable 
				of acquiring several sciences that are still latent and not 
				existent” (<i>Jawahir al-Qur’an</i>).&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Al-Ghazali gives reasons why certain type of pursuit of some 
				sciences may not be desirable. These reasons are: a) what is 
				true in some sciences may lead one to accept what is false in 
				those or other related sciences; b) some sciences have no use; 
				and c) pursuit of science is wrong if it is motivated by wrong 
				intentions such as “attaining worldly ends, securing its 
				vanities, acquiring its dignities, surpassing your 
				contemporaries”.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Al-Ghazali’s views here, although not entirely unjustifiable are 
				clearly in error. But we must keep in mind that science is not 
				defined by its conclusions but by its methodology. There has 
				never been a scientist who did not hold fundamentally erroneous 
				ideas. Consequently, if we required that a thinker should hold 
				only valid ideas before we can put him on the side of 
				rationality and science, then no human will fit the bill. One 
				can even be critical of science and rationality and yet be 
				completely scientific and rational. It is also true that a 
				person can make excellent contributions to a very specific area 
				of science and yet may be very irrational and unscientific in 
				his views generally. The way al-Ghazali debates the issues 
				qualifies him as a rational and scientific man. He was certainly 
				wrong in considering certain sciences useless, but it is 
				possible to argue with him with evidence to the contrary and to 
				change his opinion. He was also wrong in his estimation of the 
				spiritual dangers of pursuing studies of some fields, but again 
				it is possible to argue with him otherwise and change his 
				positions. The tragedy for Muslims has not been that there arose 
				men like al-Ghazali in the Muslim world but that ‘ulama in 
				general did not continue to argue like them, so that when 
				abundant evidence piled up in favor of the tremendous usefulness 
				and even indispensability of many areas of science they did not 
				encourage Muslims to pursue them as <i>far<u>d</u> kifayah</i>.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
				It is also interesting that one of the recent Islamic 
				philosopher and thinker, Allamah Muhammad Iqbal has also 
				frequently made negative statements about intellectual knowledge 
				(<i>‘ilm</i>) which he contrasts with seeing (<i>na<u>z</u>r</i>) 
				and about reason (<i>‘aql</i>) which he contrasts with heart 
				(Urdu: <i>dil</i>). He has said that modern education brings 
				with it disbelief (<i>ilhad</i>). Yet no reader of Iqbal thinks 
				that he was against a vigorous pursuit of intellectual knowledge 
				and the sciences. Al-Ghazali’s negative statements about 
				philosophy, mathematics etc can probably be evaluated 
				similarly.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
				Hoodbhoy does not at all mention Iqbal in his book. This 
				omission at first sight seems surprising, considering that Iqbal 
				is such an influential thinker, especially in Pakistan, a 
				country to which Hoodbhoy pays special attention. But the 
				omission is quite understandable: Because of Iqbal’s status, not 
				only among the general public but also among the very educated 
				people, Hoodbhoy could not present him as a villain, and yet 
				Iqbal says all the things that the author’s villains say. Any 
				treatment of Iqbal would have exposed the artificiality of our 
				author’s sharp distinction, in terms of darkness and light, 
				between orthodoxy and philosophy/science. </p>

				<b><span style="font-size: 14pt">Al-Ghazali’s Views on 
				Cause-Effect Relation and Free Will</span></b>&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				One reason al-Ghazali is put squarely against rationality is 
				Hoodbhoy’s understanding of the term. Following Nietzshe, 
				Hoodbhoy defines “rationality” as “a matrix of connections which 
				assigns cause to effect”. In this form, the definition can 
				hardly exclude any one from rationality, since almost every 
				human being, from the primitive man living in jungles to the 
				most sophisticated researcher, in some way accepts the validity 
				of cause and effect relationship. Even animals must at some 
				level have a notion of this relationship, for otherwise they 
				could not function as living organisms. The difference lies in 
				the degree to which the relationship is viewed as deterministic 
				or necessary. Hoodbhoy often seems to assume -- and make part of 
				rationality -- a strictly deterministic connection, that is, 
				every event (with the possible exception of the big bang?) can 
				be assigned a set of causes that uniquely determine that event. 
				The problem with this view of rationality is that it has 
				identified rationality with a particular position on the 
				cause-effect relationship. A satisfactory definition of 
				rationality, however, should leave room for questioning all 
				positions including a position on the cause-effect relationship. 
				The irreducible minimum of such a definition should consist only 
				of: a) a belief in the general intelligibility of the universal 
				order, b) some rules of logic, and c) use of observations and 
				experiments in validating all models of the universe.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				If one must connect rationality and the acceptance of a cause 
				and effect relation, the connection should be expressed in 
				probabilistic terms. One could, for example, say: Rationality 
				assigns probabilities to possible effects resulting from a given 
				set of causes, consistent with whatever observations we do 
				possess and whatever analysis of those observations we are able 
				to conduct. We become irrational when we assign probabilities 
				(including 0 and 1) to effects without regard to available 
				observations.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				To get back to our author, Hoodbhoy condemns al-Ghazali for 
				denying that the cause-effect relationship is sufficient for 
				explaining events in the universe and for accepting the belief 
				in predestination. What Hoodbhoy fails to realize is that even 
				if these positions are wrong, they are not irrational or against 
				science, since logic and science cannot prove them false. 
				Al-Ghazali said that “the conjunction (<i>al-‘iqtir</i>a<i>n</i>) 
				between what is conceived by way of habit (<i>fi al-‘</i>a<i>dah</i>) 
				as cause and effect is not necessary (<i>laysa <u>d</u>aruriyyan</i>).”&nbsp; 
				Many centuries later the philosopher David Hume will argue a 
				similar position. This position can also be justifiably derived 
				from modern quantum physics, which admits the possibility that a 
				given state of the universe may lead in any future moment of 
				time one of several possible states. If so, then just as 
				al-Ghazali said, cause-effect relationship is not necessary.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				As for al-Ghazali’s belief in predestination, it can be 
				justified by the assumption, perfectly reasonable, that human 
				thoughts and actions are events in the universe and are subject 
				to laws according to which the universe functions. This leads to 
				two possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				First, we may assume a deterministic universe in the sense that 
				there are laws, discoverable through science, according to which 
				one state of the universe completely determines all future 
				states. In particular, all human activities are completely 
				predetermined by the past states of the universe. There is 
				nothing inherently irrational about such a deterministic view of 
				the universe. Indeed, it is a reasonable deduction from the 
				cause-effect relationship, so important for Hoodbhoy, and has 
				often been assumed by philosophers and scientists, especially in 
				the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century. Buoyed by the 
				initial successes of science to explain the data available at 
				the time, some scientists believed that everything that happens 
				in the universe, including human feelings, thoughts, choices, 
				and actions can be explained, at least in theory, in terms of 
				the motions of various particles in the human body and elsewhere 
				in the universe and therefore can be predicted, at least in 
				theory, using some boundary conditions and the mathematical 
				equations of physics. There is no real difference between this 
				view and the belief in predestination, except that the term 
				“predestination” suggests that human actions are predetermined 
				not by some boundary conditions and mathematical laws but by 
				some intelligent agent or God.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Second, we may assume a non-deterministic universe of the type 
				described by quantum physics. In this case, we can reasonably 
				argue that while a given state is not completely determined by 
				the past states <u>according to the laws discoverable by science</u>, 
				it is nevertheless <u>uniquely determined</u> in the sense that 
				“it will be what it will be, and could not be anything else”. 
				This is again equivalent to predestination.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Hoodbhoy again and again stresses the importance of belief in 
				the freedom of will and in a strict cause-effect relationship. 
				But there is a contradiction between the two beliefs. For, if a 
				free exercise of human will is an event within the observable 
				universe, it cannot be assigned a sufficient cause, for 
				otherwise it cannot be “free” in any reasonable sense. On the 
				other hand, if free will operates somewhere outside the 
				observable universe, then the actions resulting from this 
				operation of will, which clearly take place within the 
				observable universe, cannot be assigned a sufficient cause 
				within that universe. In either case the belief in freedom of 
				will implies that there are events in the observable universe 
				that cannot be assigned sufficient causes within that universe, 
				that is, we cannot at the same time affirm belief in the freedom 
				of will and belief in a strict cause-effect relationship 
				governing the observable universe.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				In the light of above comments, one can conclude that Hoodbhoy’s 
				pronouncements against al-Ghazali are somewhat superficial, 
				since they do not proceed from a proper study of al-Ghazali and 
				of the philosophical and scientific issues connected with 
				predestination, free will, and cause-effect relationship.</p>

				While reading the book, I got the impression that the author is 
				reluctant to deal with “Islam and Science” from the point of 
				view of Islam not only because he might not have sufficient 
				knowledge and understanding of Islam but also because for that 
				very reason he does not have a really positive view of religion. 
				A few positive statements about Islam that he does make seem to 
				be a concession to the reality that Islam is a fact of life in 
				the Muslim world. This impression was confirmed when I came 
				across the author’s article on <b>“</b>Muslims and the West 
				after September 11” (downloaded from the Internet on July 1, 
				2002). In that article he states:&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				“Our collective survival lies in recognizing that <u>religion is 
				not the solution</u>; neither is nationalism. Both are divisive, 
				embedding within us false notions of superiority and arrogant 
				pride that are difficult to erase. <u>We have but one choice</u>:
				<u>the path of secular humanism</u>,<u> based upon the 
				principles of logic and reason</u>. <u>This alone offers the 
				hope</u> of providing everybody on this globe with the right to 
				life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				The author formulates here in clear terms a position that was 
				probably present in his mind in some form when he wrote the book 
				under review, about a decade earlier (in 1991).&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				In the article he also repeats his attack against “religious 
				orthodoxy” becoming somewhat harsher:&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				“Science flourished in the Golden Age of Islam because there was 
				within Islam a strong rationalist tradition, carried on by a 
				group of Muslim thinkers known as the Mutazilites. This 
				tradition stressed human free will, strongly opposing the 
				predestinarians who taught that everything was foreordained and 
				that humans have no option but to surrender everything to Allah. 
				While the Mutazilites held political power, knowledge grew. But 
				in the twelfth century Muslim orthodoxy reawakened, spearheaded 
				by the cleric Imam Al-Ghazali. Al-Ghazali championed revelation 
				over reason, predestination over free will. He refuted the 
				possibility of relating cause to effect, teaching that man 
				cannot know or predict what will happen; God alone can. He 
				damned mathematics as against Islam, an intoxicant of the mind 
				that weakened faith.” (Hoodbhoy, “Muslims and the West after 
				September 11”).&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent2" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				Clearly, Hoodbhoy has not learnt very much over the past ten 
				years, since his criticism of al-Ghazali and religious orthodoxy 
				reflects the same lack of understanding of the writings of 
				al-Ghazali and the complexity of the issues connected with 
				predestination, free will, and cause-effect relationship that he 
				manifested in his book.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				As for the secularist position, Hoodbhoy seems to assert it on 
				the strength of its present popularity and dominance rather than 
				on the basis of any rational analysis. We find only the 
				following sweeping generalizations:&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" align="justify">
				“Islam—like Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, or any other 
				religion—is not about peace. Nor is it about war. Every religion 
				is about absolute belief in its own superiority and its divine 
				right to impose itself upon others. In medieval times, both the 
				Crusades and the Jihads were soaked in blood. Today, Christian 
				fundamentalists attack abortion clinics in the US and kill 
				doctors; Muslim fundamentalists wage their sectarian wars 
				against each other; Jewish settlers holding the Old Testament in 
				one hand and Uzis in the other burn olive orchards and drive 
				Palestinians off their ancestral land; Hindus in India demolish 
				ancient mosques and burn down churches; Sri Lankan Buddhists 
				slaughter Tamil separatists”&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
				Here the author fails to notice that his criticism of religions 
				applies to his own secularist position. Notice the absolutist 
				statements: “we have but <u>one choice</u>: the path of secular 
				humanism …”; “<u>this alone</u> offers the hope …”. There is 
				here the same “absolute belief” in the “superiority” of secular 
				humanism that religions are criticized for. The author seems 
				unable to admit the possibility that religion might be able to 
				provide a better alternative to secular humanism.&nbsp; As for the 
				list of the bloody battles in which followers of various 
				religions have been involved, certainly secularism has not 
				prevented people from similarly bloody wars. Hoodbhoy would have 
				to claim that this is because the existing secularist countries 
				like the USA and UK ceaselessly wage war because they are 
				nationalistic and not sufficiently secularist-humanist and that 
				if we can have a perfect humanist secular society, it will not 
				engage in bloody wars. Well, many religious groups also claim 
				that if a true form of their religion was in practice somewhere 
				they will not do some of the wrong things that they now do.&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px">
				There is no substantial difference between the mentality 
				Hoodbhoy manifests and those of the religious people whom he 
				criticizes. He has simply replaced religion with his favored 
				ideology. It seems fair to say that Hoodbhoy has become or is in 
				the process of becoming a fundamentalist secularist-humanist.</p>

				<b><span style="font-size: 16pt">IN CONCLUSION, </span></b>
				Hoodbhoy’s perspective on “Islam and Science” comes from a lost 
				faith and from a somewhat immature rationality. For this reason 
				he cannot see what some other thinkers such as Allamah Iqbal 
				could see: Secular humanism or any other similar set of ideas is 
				not the “only way”. Islamic civilization, after its present 
				ruin, will once again vibrate with life as an <u>authentically</u> 
				Islamic civilization, not only overcoming some of its deep 
				problems but also guiding humanity to a vastly better
