				Lal Masjid</font></p>
				<p align="center"><font size="4"><a href="index.html">Pervez 
				Hoodbhoy</a> </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many well-known 
				Pakistani political commentators seem bent upon trivializing Lal 
				Masjid. Although the mosque's bloody siege has now entered into 
				its fifth day, for them the comic sight of the bearded Maulana 
				Abdul Aziz fleeing in a burqa is proof that this episode was 
				mere puppet theatre. They say it was enacted by hidden hands 
				within the government, expressly created to distract attention 
				away from General Musharraf's mounting problems, as well as to 
				prove to his supporters in Washington that he remains the last 
				bulwark against Islamic extremism. The writers conclude that 
				this is a contrived problem, not a real one. They are dead 
				wrong. Lal Masjid underscores the danger of runaway religious 
				radicalism in Pakistan. It calls for urgent and wide-ranging 
				action. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That the crisis could 
				have been averted is beyond doubt. The Lal Masjid militants were 
				given a free hand by the government to kidnap and intimidate. 
				For months, under the nose of Pakistan's super-vigilant 
				intelligence agencies, large quantities of arms and fuel were 
				smuggled inside to create a fearsome fortress in the heart of 
				the nation's capital. Even after Jamia Hafsa students went on 
				their violent rampages in February 2007, no attempt was made to 
				cut off the electricity, gas, phone, or website - or even to 
				shut down their illegal FM radio station. Operating as a 
				parallel government, the mullah duo, Maulana Abdul Rashid Ghazi 
				and Maulana Abdul Aziz, ran their own Islamic court. They 
				received the Saudi Arabian ambassador on the mosque premises, 
				and negotiated with the Chinese ambassador for the release of 
				his country's kidnapped nationals. But for the outrage expressed 
				by China, Pakistan's all-weather ally, the status quo would have 
				continued. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For a state that has not 
				shied from using even artillery and airpower on its citizens, 
				the softness on the mullahs was astonishing. Even as the writ of 
				the state was being openly defied, the chief negotiator 
				appointed by Musharraf, Chaudhry Shujaat Husain, described the 
				burqa brigade militants as &quot;our daughters&quot; with whom 
				negotiations would continue and against whom &quot;no operation could 
				be contemplated&quot;. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But this still does not 
				prove that the fanatics were deliberately set up, or that 
				radicalism and extremism is a fringe phenomenon. The Lal Masjid 
				mullahs, even as they directed kidnappings and vigilante squads, 
				continued to lead thousands during Friday prayers. Uncounted 
				thousands of other radically charged mullahs daily berate 
				captive audiences about immoralities in society and dangle 
				promises of heaven for the pious. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What explains the 
				explosive growth of this phenomenon? </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Imperial America's 
				policies in the Muslim world are usually held to blame. But its 
				brutalities elsewhere have been far greater. In tiny Vietnam, 
				the Americans had killed more than one million people. 
				Nevertheless, the Vietnamese did not invest in explosive vests 
				and belts. Today if one could wipe America off the map of the 
				world with a wet cloth, mullah-led fanaticism will not 
				disappear. I have often asked those of our students at 
				Quaid-e-Azam University who toe the Lal Masjid line why, if they 
				are so concerned about the fate of Muslims, they did not join 
				the many demonstrations organized by their professors in 2003/4 
				against the immoral US invasion of Iraq. The question leaves 
				them unfazed. For them the greater sin is for women to walk 
				around bare faced, or the very notion that they could be 
				considered the equal of men. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Extremism is often 
				claimed to be the consequence of poverty. But deprivation and 
				suffering do not, by themselves, lead to radicalism. People in 
				Pakistan's tribal areas, now under the grip of the Taliban, have 
				never led more than a subsistence existence. Building more 
				roads, supplying electricity and making schools - if the Taliban 
				allow - is a great idea. But it will have little impact upon 
				militancy. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lack of educational 
				opportunity is also not a sufficient cause. It is a shame that 
				less than 65% of Pakistani children have schools to go to, and 
				only 3% of the eligible population goes to universities. But 
				these are improvements over 30 years ago when terrorism was not 
				an issue. More importantly, violent extremism has jumped the 
				educational divide. The 911 hijackers and the Glasgow airport 
				doctors were highly educated men and were supported in spirit by 
				thousands of similarly educated Muslims in Pakistan and the 
				world at large. It is not clear to me whether persons with 
				degrees are relatively more or less susceptible to extremist 
				versions of Islam. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above, as I have 
				argued, are insufficient causes although they are significant as 
				contributory reasons. There are more compelling explanations: 
				the official sponsorship of jihad by the Pakistani establishment 
				in earlier times; the poison injected into students through 
				their textbooks; and the fantastic growth of madrassas across 
				Pakistan. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But most of all, it has 
				been the cowardly deference of Pakistani leaders to blackmail by 
				mullahs. Their instinctive response has been to seek 
				appeasement. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had suddenly turned Islamic in 
				his final days as he made a desperate, but ultimately 
				unsuccessful, attempt to save his government and life. A fearful 
				Benazir Bhutto made no attempt to challenge the horrific Hudood 
				and blasphemy laws during her premierships. And Nawaz Sharif 
				went a step further by attempting to bring the Shariah to 
				Pakistan. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such slavish kow-towing 
				had powerful consequences. The crimes of mullahs, because they 
				are committed in the name of Islam, go unpunished today. The 
				situation in Pakistan's tribal areas is dire and deteriorating. 
				Inspired by the fiery rhetoric from mosques, fanatics murder 
				doctors and health workers administering polio shots. They blow 
				up video shops and girls schools, kill barbers who shave beards, 
				stone alleged adulterers to death, and destroy billboards with 
				women's faces. No one is caught or punished. Pakistan's civil 
				society has chosen to remain largely silent, unmoved by this 
				barbarism. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This silence has allowed 
				tribal extremism to migrate effortlessly into the cities. Except 
				for the posh areas of the largest metropolises, it is now 
				increasingly difficult for a woman to walk bare-faced through 
				most city bazaars. Reflections of Jamia Hafsa can be found in 
				every public university of Pakistan. Here, as elsewhere, a 
				sustained campaign of proselytizing and intimidation is showing 
				results. In fact, it would do little harm to rename my 
				university, now a city of walking tents, as Jamia Quaid-e-Azam.
				</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On April 12, to terrify 
				the last few hold-outs, the Lal Masjid mullahs declared in their 
				FM radio broadcast that Quaid-e-Azam University had turned into 
				a brothel. They warned that Jamia Hafsa girls could throw acid 
				on the faces of those female university students who refuse to 
				cover their faces. There should have been instant outrage. 
				Instead, fear and caution prevailed. The university 
				administration was silent, as was the university's chancellor, 
				General Musharraf. A university-wide meeting of about 200 
				students and teachers, held in the physics department, 
				eventually concluded with a condemnation of the mullahs threat 
				and a demand for their removal as head clerics of a 
				government-funded mosque. But student opinion on burqas was 
				split: many felt that although the mullahs had gone a tad too 
				far, covering of the face was indeed properly Islamic and needed 
				enforcement. Twenty years ago this would have been a minority 
				opinion. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Lal Masjid crisis is 
				a direct consequence of the ambivalence of General Musharraf's 
				regime towards Islamic militancy. In part it comes from fear and 
				follows the tradition of appeasement. Another part comes from 
				the confusion of whether to cultivate the Taliban - who can help 
				keep Indian influence out of Afghanistan - or whether to fight 
				them. One grieves for the officers and jawans killed in the 
				on-going battle with fanatics. It must feel especially terrible 
				to be killed by one's former friends and allies. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What should the 
				government do after the guns stop firing and the hostages are 
				out, whether dead or alive? At least two immediate actions are 
				needed. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First, those who 
				publicly preach hatred in mosques and call for violence against 
				the citizens of Pakistan should be denied the opportunity to do 
				so. The government should announce that any citizen who hears 
				such sermons should record them, and lodge a charge in the 
				nearest designated complaint office. The guilty should be dealt 
				with severely under the law. In the tribal areas, using force if 
				necessary, the dozens of currently operating illegal FM radio 
				stations should be closed down. Run by mullahs bitterly hostile 
				to each other on doctrinal or personal grounds, they incite 
				bitter tribal and sectarian wars. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Second, one must not 
				minimize the danger posed by madrassas. It is not just their 
				gun-toting militants, but the climate of intolerance they create 
				in society. Where and when necessary, and after sufficient 
				warning, they must be shut down. Establishment of new madrassas 
				must be strictly limited. Apologists say that only 5-10 percent 
				of madrassas breed militancy, and thus dismiss this as a fringe 
				phenomenon. But if the number of Pakistani madrassas is 20,000 
				(give or take a few thousand; nobody knows for sure) this 
				amounts to 1000-2000. Although all are not equally lethal, this 
				is surely a lot of dangerous fringe. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The government's 
				madrassa reform program has fallen flat on its face, and future 
				efforts will do no better. It was absurd to have assumed that 
				introducing computers or teaching English could have transformed 
				the character of madrassa education away from brain-washing and 
				rote memorization towards logical behaviour and critical 
				thinking. Did the adeptness with which Lal Masjid managed its 
				website really bring it into the 21'st century? Madrassas are 
				religious institutions; they cannot be changed into normal 
				schools. It is time to give up wasting money and effort in 
				attempting to reform them and, instead, to radically improve the 
				public education system and make it a viable alternative. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Lal Masjid battle is 
				part of the wider civil war within the Islamic world waged by 
				totalitarian forces that seek redemption through violence. Their 
				cancerous radicalism pits Muslims against Muslims, and the world 
				at large. It is only peripherally directed against the excesses 
				of the corrupt ruling establishment, or inspired by issues of 
				justice and equity. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Note that the Lal Masjid 
				ideologues - and others of their ilk - do not rouse their 
				followers to action on matters of poverty, unemployment, poor 
				access to justice, lack of educational opportunities, corruption 
				within the army and bureaucracy, or the sufferings of peasants 
				and workers. Instead their actions are concentrated entirely on 
				improving morality, where morality is interpreted almost 
				exclusively in relation to women and perceived Western cultural 
				invasion. They do not consider as immoral such things as 
				exploiting workers, cheating customers, bribing officials, 
				beating their wives, not paying taxes, or breaking traffic 
				rules. Their interpretation of religion leads to bizarre 
				failures in logic, moral reasoning, and appreciation of human 
				life. </font></p>
