  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a severe and long-standing 
  crisis in higher education. But, until the present military government took 
  the initiative, there was no rehabilitation plan. Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman, 
  appointed as chairman of the Higher Education Commission, was the wonder-man 
  charged by General Musharraf with turning the situation around. He was quick 
  to make a powerful pitch for vast increases in funding. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Foreign donors, worried about the 
  implications of Pakistan's sinking educational system, obliged. The higher 
  education budget zoomed by twelve times (1,200 per cent) over three years, a 
  world record. A number of new and innovative utilization schemes were 
  announced. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some solid achievements did emerge. 
  Internet connectivity in universities has been substantially expanded; 
  distance education is being seriously pursued through the newly established 
  Virtual University; a digital library is in operation; some foreign faculty 
  has been hired; students are being sent abroad for PhD training (albeit 
  largely to second rate institutions); some links with foreign institutions now 
  exist; and money for scientific equipment is no longer a problem. No previous 
  Pakistani government can boast of comparable accomplishments, and the HEC 
  chairman deserves congratulations. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the HEC is also setting into 
  motion very dangerous, potentially catastrophic, systemic changes. In this 
  article I will look at the problems in our higher education system and why the 
  HEC reforms are set to make a bad situation worse rather than better. In a 
  subsequent article, I will suggest some modest steps that may offer a way 
  forward. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pakistan has almost a hundred 
  universities now. Not one of them is world class. Truth be told, not even one 
  of them is a real university, if by a university one means a community of 
  scholars engaged in free inquiry and the creation of knowledge. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Take for example the Quaid-i-Azam 
  University in Islamabad, reputed to be Pakistan's best. Academic activities 
  common in good universities around the world are noticeably absent. Seminars 
  and colloquia, where faculty present for peer review the results of their 
  on-going research, are few and far between. Public lectures, debates, or 
  discussions of contemporary scientific, cultural, or political issues are 
  almost non-existent. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The teaching at QAU is no better. Rote 
  learning is common, students are not encouraged to ask questions in class, and 
  courses are rarely completed by the end of the semester. This university has 
  three mosques but no bookstore. It is becoming more like a madressah in other 
  ways too. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was not always this way. The global 
  intellectual ferment of the late 1960's and 70's had a stimulating impact on 
  Pakistani campuses. Intellectual, scientific, cultural and literary activity 
  flourished. Young Pakistani scholars gave up potential careers in the West to 
  come to Pakistani universities. But in November of 1981, just days after three 
  QAU teachers had been caught with anti-martial law and pro-democracy 
  pamphlets, General Ziaul Haq thundered on television that he would &quot;purge the 
  country's universities of the cancer of politics&quot;. He succeeded. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A quarter century later, the faculty 
  are more concerned with money and promotions than research, teaching, or 
  bringing their knowledge to bear on the myriad issues facing our society. 
  Among the students there are many burqas and beards, but minuscule 
  intellectual or creative activity. All student unions are gone, and 
  ideological disputes have evaporated into the thin air. Instead of left vs 
  right politics there is simple tribalism. Now Punjabi students gang together 
  against Pakhtoon students, Muhajirs versus Sindhis, Shias versus Sunnis, etc.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some campuses are run by gangs of 
  hoodlums and harbour known criminals, while others have Rangers with machine 
  guns on continuous patrol. On occasion, student wolf packs attack each other 
  with sticks, stones, pistols, and automatic weapons. There are many campus 
  murders. Most students have not learned how to think; they cannot speak or 
  write any language well, rarely read newspapers, and cannot formulate a 
  coherent argument or manage any significant creative expression. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dumbed down, this generation of 
  Pakistanis is intellectually handicapped. Like overgrown children, students of 
  my university now kill time by making colourful birthday posters for friends, 
  do &quot;istikhara&quot; (fortune telling), and wander aimlessly in Islamabad's bazaars.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Understanding the scale of the failure 
  is important. Compare Pakistan's premier university with those in its 
  neighbours' capitals. First to the east: Jawaharlal Nehru University, and the 
  Indian Institute of Technology, in Delhi. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Their facilities are simple and 
  functional, nothing like the air-conditioned and carpeted offices of most 
  professors at QAU. And, more important, every notice board is crammed with 
  notices for seminars and colloquia, visitors from the very best foreign 
  universities lecture there, research laboratories hum with activity, and pride 
  and satisfaction are written all around. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Conflict on campuses does exist - 
  communist and socialist students battle with Hindutva students over the Gujrat 
  carnage, Iraq, Kashmir, and the BJP doctoring of history. Angry words are 
  exchanged and polemics are issued against the other, but no heads are bashed. 
  While lecturing at these institutions during a recent visit, I was impressed 
  by the fearlessness and the informed, critical intelligence of the students 
  who questioned and challenged me. I cannot imagine an Indian professor having 
  a similar reception in Pakistan. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now to the west: Teheran's Sharif 
  University of Technology, and the Institute for Theoretical Physics and 
  Mathematics, are impressive institutions filled with professional activity, 
  workshops, and seminars. Even as they maintain good academic standards, 
  Iranian university students are heavily political and today are spearheading 
  the movement for freedom and democracy. Iranian students make it to the best 
  US graduate schools. Although it is an Islamic republic, bookshops are more 
  common than mosques in Tehran. Translations into Farsi appear in just weeks or 
  months after a book is published in the western world. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Driven by the unfavourable comparison 
  with neighbours, the need for university reform finally became an issue. The 
  first big idea was that Pakistan needed more universities. So today all it 
  takes is a piece of paper from the HEC and some paint. Some colleges have 
  literally had their signboards taken down for repainting, and been put back up 
  changed into &quot;universities&quot; the next day. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By such sleight of hand the current 
  tally of public universities, according to the HEC website, is now officially 
  47, up from the 23 officially listed in 1996. In addition, there are eight 
  degree awarding public sector institutes. Unfortunately, this is merely a 
  numbers game. All new public sector universities lack infrastructure, 
  libraries, laboratories, adequate faculty, or even a pool of students 
  academically prepared to study at the university level. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The HEC's &quot;generosity&quot; extends even 
  into largely illiterate tribal areas. There are so-called universities now in 
  Malakand, Bannu, Kohat, Khuzdar, Gujrat, Haripur, and in many other places 
  where it is difficult to detect the slightest potential for successfully 
  establishing modern universities. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another poorly thought-out, and 
  dangerous, HEC scheme involves giving massive cash awards to university 
  teachers for publishing research papers - Rs 60,000 per paper published in a 
  foreign journal. Although these stimulants are said to have increased the 
  number of papers published in international journals by a whopping 44 per 
  cent, there is little evidence that this increase in volume is the result of 
  an increase in genuine research activity. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fact is only a slim minority of 
  Pakistani academics possesses the ethics, motivation, and capability needed 
  for genuine scientific discovery and research. For the majority, the HEC 
  incentives are a powerful reason to discover the art of publishing in research 
  journals without doing research, to find loopholes, and to learn how to cover 
  up one's tracks. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Established practices of plagiarizing 
  papers, multiple publications of slightly different versions of the same paper 
  in different research journals, fabricating scientific data, and seeking out 
  third-rate foreign journals with only token referees are now even more common. 
  The HEC has broadcast the message: corruption pays. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The casual disregard for quality is 
  most obvious in the HEC's massive PhD production programme. This involves 
  enrolling 1,000 students in Pakistani universities every year for PhD degrees. 
  Thereby Pakistan's &quot;PhD deficit&quot; (it produces less than 50 PhDs per annum at 
  present) will supposedly be solved and it will soon be at par with India. In 
  consequence, an army of largely incapable and ignorant students, armed with 
  hefty HEC fellowships, has sallied forth to write PhD theses. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although the HEC claims that it has 
  checked the students through a &quot;GRE type test&quot; (the American graduate school 
  admission test), a glance at the question papers reveals it to be only a 
  shoddy literacy and numeric test. In my department, advertised as the best 
  physics department in the country, the average PhD student now has trouble 
  with high-school level physics and even with reading English. Nevertheless 
  there are as many as 18 PhD students registered with one supervisor! In the 
  QAU biology department, that number rises to 37 for one supervisor. HEC 
  incentives have helped dilute PhD qualifying exams to the point where it is 
  difficult for any student not to pass. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The implications of this 
  mass-production of PhDs are dire. Very soon hundreds and, in time, thousands 
  of worthless PhDs will be cranked out. They will train even less competent 
  students. Eventually they will become heads of departments and institutions. 
  When appointed gatekeepers, they will regard more competent individuals as 
  threats to be kept locked out. The degenerative spiral, long evident in any 
  number of Pakistani institutions, will worsen rapidly, and become infinitely 
  more difficult to break. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">REFORMING PAKISTAN'S UNIVERSITIES -- 
  II by Pervez Hoodbhoy (Dawn 04 Jan 2005) </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For three decades Pakistani education 
  planners toyed with grand plans to build MITs and Harvards in the country. 
  Nothing materialized. But three years ago the first serious effort to deal 
  with Pakistan's chronically ill universities was finally initiated. 
  Unfortunately, this effort by the Higher Education Commission has now become 
  mired in an intense, growing controversy. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The immediate cause centres on the 
  award of fake degrees and the flourishing of substandard higher education 
  institutions, as well as on the HEC's head, Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman, having 
  personally punished the whistle-blower who brought this important issue to his 
  (and the public's) notice. While unpleasant, this controversy is important 
  because it addresses the deeper underlying question of the quality and 
  credibility - rather than just the quantity – of higher education. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the previous article, I explained 
  how badly the existing university system has been broken and how the current 
  university reform strategy is compounding the problem by concentrating on 
  glitzy things like internet access, digital libraries, virtual learning, etc., 
  while ignoring basic problems. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Allowing these &quot;reforms&quot; to continue 
  will destroy what little there is today. On the other hand, it will be a 
  tragedy for Pakistan if the current HEC attempts collapse in a heap of dust. 
  So, how to proceed if we are serious in trying to improve our universities?
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The policy don'ts are clear. Some have 
  already been discussed earlier: stop the creation of worthless new 
  universities; stop funding and rewarding research that really isn't research; 
  stop dishing out useless PhDs; stop playing the numbers game; and stop feeding 
  academic corruption. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The do's are far more than can be 
  discussed here. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into two mutually 
  distinct sets. One set must deal with raising the level of general competence 
  of teachers and students by ensuring that they actually have an understanding 
  of the subject they teach or study, and with increasing the amount of research 
  in specific disciplines. Universities everywhere prepare engineers, doctors, 
  economists, business managers, and other professionals needed to fulfil the 
  stringent demands of a modern society. Pakistani universities obviously need 
  to do the same. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The second set relates to the broader 
  function of universities - to create thinking minds, pursue research in 
  subjects that are important but are not of immediate economic utility, to 
  create and organize discourses on social and political issues, and to raise 
  the cultural and aesthetic level of society. Whereas the Soviet and Chinese 
  models concentrated exclusively on the first set of goals, western 
  universities - or at least the good ones among them - successfully synthesized 
  both sets and were far superior. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is a mistake to believe that 
  inadequate financial resources have prevented Pakistani universities from 
  achieving the goals of the first set. In fact, the real need is for deep 
  administrative and organizational reforms, together with the strong political 
  will needed to handle the counter-reaction they would inevitably provoke.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First, there must be university 
  entrance examinations at the national level to separate individuals who can 
  benefit from higher education from those who cannot. No such system exists in 
  Pakistan. Only local board examinations - where rote memorization and massive 
  cheating are rampant - are used to select students. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But, on our borders, both Iran and 
  India have centralized university admissions systems that work very well. 
  Although corruption in India is perhaps as pervasive as in Pakistan, 
  admissions to the IITs have nevertheless retained their integrity and 
  intensely competitive nature over several decades. Honest examinations are 
  presumably also possible in Pakistan, provided extreme care is taken. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having such university entrance 
  examinations would be important for another reason as well - they would set 
  the goal posts for colleges and high schools all over Pakistan. In the US, the 
  Scholastic Aptitude Tests, centrally administered by Princeton, are extremely 
  useful for deciding student aptitude for university education. The &quot;A&quot; level 
  examinations in Britain have similar importance. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the PhD level, if the HEC is at all 
  serious about standards, it should make it mandatory for every Pakistani 
  university to require that a PhD candidate achieve a certain minimum in an 
  international examination such as the GRE. These exams are used by US 
  universities for admission into PhD programmes. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Given the state of student and teacher 
  knowledge, and the quantity and quality of research in Pakistani universities, 
  selection through GRE subject tests would have the welcome consequence of 
  cutting down the number enrolled in HEC indigenous PhD programmes from 1,000 
  per year to a few dozen. The present safeguard of having &quot;foreign experts&quot; 
  evaluate theses is insufficient for a variety of reasons, including the 
  manipulations commonly made in the process of referee selection. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Second, we need to test those who 
  would be university teachers. The system has remained broken for so long that 
  written entrance tests for junior faculty, standardized at a central facility, 
  are essential. Without them, universities will continue to hire teachers who 
  freely convey their confusion and ignorance to students. Most teachers today 
  never consult a textbook, choosing to dictate from notes they saved from the 
  time when they were students in the same department. No teacher has ever been 
  fired for demonstrating incompetence in his/her subject. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Third, the recruitment of 
  non-permanent foreign faculty, whether of Pakistani origin or otherwise, is 
  essential. Although this country is home to 150 million people, there are 
  perhaps fewer than 20 computer scientists of sufficient calibre who could 
  possibly get tenure-track positions at some B-grade US university. In physics, 
  even if one roped in every competent physicist in the country, it would not be 
  possible to staff even one single good department of physics. As for 
  mathematics: it is impossible to find even five real mathematicians in 
  Pakistan. The social sciences are no better. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this grim situation, it is 
  fortunate that the Higher Education Commission has initiated a programme for 
  hiring foreign faculty with attractive salaries. But the success of this 
  programme is uncertain. Jealousy at salary differentials, and a fear that 
  local incompetence will be exposed, have led local teachers and university 
  administrations to block the hiring of faculty from abroad. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is another problem: Pakistan's 
  image as a violent country deters most foreigners from wanting to come and 
  live in Pakistan for any considerable period of time. Therefore, westerners 
  are almost totally absent from the list of those who have applied under the 
  foreign faculty hiring programme. Apart from Pakistani expatriates in the 
  Middle East, the bulk of applicants are Russian speakers from the former 
  Soviet Union countries. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One wishes it could be otherwise. It 
  would be a major breakthrough if Indian and Iranian teachers could be brought 
  to Pakistan. Indians, in particular, would find it much easier to adapt to 
  local ways and customs than others and also have smaller salary expectations. 
  The huge pool of strong Indian candidates could be used to Pakistan's 
  advantage - it could pick the best teachers and researchers, and those most 
  likely to make a positive impact on the system. In the present mood of 
  rapprochement, it is hard to think of a more meaningful confidence building 
  measure. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fourth, we need better, more 
  transparent, and accountable ways to recruit vice-chancellors and senior 
  administrators. What we have now is a patronage system that appoints 
  unqualified and unsuitable bureaucrats or generals as vice-chancellors, and 
  that staffs universities with corrupt and incompetent administrators. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While a tenure-track system for 
  faculty is currently under discussion and may allow for breaking with the 
  system of life-long jobs independent of performance, there is no corresponding 
  system being contemplated for the top leadership. But without good leadership, 
  and people who can set an example, no institution can be reformed. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, it is crucial to bring back 
  on to the campuses meaningful discussions on social, cultural and political 
  issues. To create the culture of civilized debate, student unions must be 
  restored, with elections for student representatives. They will be the next 
  generation of political leaders. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such a step will not be free from 
  problems - religious vigilantes rule many Pakistani campuses although all 
  unions are banned. Extremists would surely try to take advantage of the new 
  opportunities offered once the ban is lifted. Political parties have also been 
  less than responsible. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the reinstatement of unions - 
  subject to their elected leaders making a pledge to abjure violence and the 
  disruption of academic activity - is the only way forward towards creating a 
  university culture on campus. Ultimately, reasonable voices, too, will become 
  heard. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To condemn Pakistani students as 
  fundamentally incapable of responsible behaviour amounts to a condemnation of 
  the Pakistani nation itself. If students in our neighbouring countries can 
  successfully study, as well as unionize and engage in larger issues, then 
  surely Pakistan's can do so as well. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The task of university reform has not 
  yet seriously begun. Nor can it do so until issues of the purpose and 
  philosophy of higher education and of the goal of the reforms are squarely 
  confronted. It is time to decide whether we are serious about education being 
  something more than merely giving out certificates. Do we want to build 
  institutions for creating knowledge and helping students to be informed, 
  critical, active citizens? Or not? </font></p>
