  <p>Motarunnesa Maternal and Infant care (MMIC) was established in June2002 as an 
	NGO g in sadar union of Chuadanga district. It is exclusively organized for 
	providing health care services to the rural disadvantaged population. A 
	large portion of population specifically the&nbsp; impoverished, because of their economic 
	condition and detrimental social 
  norms are lagging behind to receive the Medicare services from the government 
  health resource centers at the time of their need. Although enough provision 
  of health services for the poor are kept in papers but because of powerful 
  evil underhand dealings the poor are deprived of getting the benefit of health 
  services and that takes many of them at the door step of death. Amongst these 
  left behind patients in the rural areas the condition of the poor expected 
  mothers and their new born child are most severe. The founder of MMIC is elderly 
  man of village Belgachi of Chuadanga district. He has long been dreaming to 
  mitigate the sufferings of these expected mothers and their new born child of 
  this village and the surrounding. To fulfill his dreams he started 
  constructing a 10 bed mother-child centre at this village Belgachi in the name 
	of his deceased mother <i>Motaharun Nesa</i>. He duly shared his dreams with his 
  relatives, nearest friends and energetic young people. They all appreciated 
  their advice and renamed his mother-child care centre &quot;Motaharun Nesa Mateenal 
  and Infant Care' (MMIC) as NGO. The NGO was then duly registered with 
  Department of Social services after completing all formalities of a NGO. It 
  was discussed in a general meeting of MMIC. </p>
  <p>That MMIC would work in tha field of (1) Primary Health Education 
  (2)provide Medical facilities to the expected mother mothers and their new 
  born child.</p>
