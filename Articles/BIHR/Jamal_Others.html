  After watching the torture of others Jamal says me that I will die if they hit 
  me like this and then Jamal touch the foot of those perpetrators and Jamal 
  also call them Father. The level of their torture was so dangerous that I 
  thought that I will not alive. Jamal was a good boy and also had good moral
