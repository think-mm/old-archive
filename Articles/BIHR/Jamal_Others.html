  After watching the torture of others Jamal says me that I will die if they hit 
  me like this and then Jamal touch the foot of those perpetrators and Jamal 
  also call them Father. The level of their torture was so dangerous that I 
  thought that I will not alive. Jamal was a good boy and also had good moral 
  character and his tea stall was situated at the turn nearer to the bus stand 
  and that is why it was a very tea stall. And Jamal earns considerable money 
  from such tea stall. i was shocked when I heard the news of death of Jamal
