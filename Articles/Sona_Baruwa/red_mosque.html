											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being a Muslim is a 
											state of universal mind. Some are 
											locked in war raging around 
											political, ethnic identity and in 
											July 2007 Pakistan launches 
											operation against radicals in 
											Islamabad’s Red Mosue (Lal Masjid), 
											seeking to end a month-long stand 
											off that has turned bloody in recent 
											days. Unfortunately talks on 
											peaceful ending apparently stall. 
											The government had earlier been 
											hoping to pressure the students to 
											leave the Red Mosque peacefully, but 
											those negotiations appeared to have 
											been broken down. Those who were 
											killed are innocent students who 
											were for getting Islamic education 
											in the Red Mosque. The Taleban, Al-Quida 
											or the Islamic fundamentalists 
											should understand that the triumph 
											over prejudice and ignorance is a 
											triumph for us all. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Humanity is like the ocean. Radical 
											Islamic clerics or nobody could 
											divide it in the name of religion or 
											Islam, thinking “I will glorify my 
											own Islamic religion by using bombs 
											and violence in destroying others.” 
											In doing so he or she injures his or 
											her own religion more gravely. Greed 
											and hatred are the roots of many 
											problems of human beings.&nbsp; To solve 
											these problems it is necessary to 
											bring greed and hatred under 
											control. Some white-supremacists 
											delve deep into Islamic and Asian 
											philosophy, ethics and civilizations 
											not for edification, but for 
											destructive criticism and 
											disparagement. But the universal 
											minds show, “Truth or Allah alone is 
											victorious.” </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											The Islamic tradition is rooted in 
											thought and debate, a tradition 
											going back to the prophet Muhammad 
											himself. Today’s Muslims like other 
											people who live in Muslim societies 
											pay only lip- service to the notions 
											of piety and faith as well as they 
											often disguise materialist greed 
											with religious face and fashion. In 
											course of time Muslims have been 
											victimized by colonialism, political 
											Islam and its fundamentalists create 
											wall of division and rule. 
											Concerning the secularism Professor 
											Talal Asad explained, “The word&nbsp; 
											(secular or almaniyy), yields the 
											abstract noun <i>almaniyyah</i> to 
											mean secularism or laicism.”
											<a name="_ednref1" title href="#_edn1">
											<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Professor Talal Asad,&nbsp; M. Mutahhar, 
											Asghar Ali Engineer, Hasan and other 
											Islamic scholars’ articles indicated 
											very well about the glimpses of 
											Islamic values and scriptures 
											including the Shariah or the code of 
											law. Islam was started with the 
											secular idea that human beings are 
											representatives of the almighty God. 
											In Islamic political thought, the 
											rulers are the Khalifas or 
											successors of the Prophet Muhammad. 
											Concerning secular ideas Prophet 
											Mohammad declared, in his last 
											sermon “There is no superiority for 
											an Arab over a non – Arab nor for a 
											non – Arab over an Arab.”

											<b><u>History of Secularism in Islam</u></b>:</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											&nbsp;Medieval Europe was enthralled by 
											Muslim civilization. Islam has been 
											encouraging its followers by 
											preserving classic philosophy, 
											promoting science, mathematics and 
											rational thought. They were : 
											Averroes (Ibn-e –Rushd), Avicenna 
											(Ibn –e – Sina)Alkhwarizmi (famous 
											for Algrithms), ibn –e – Haitham and 
											Ibne- e – Khaldoun were Muslims 
											among a long list of philosophers 
											and secular thinkers. It is also 
											remarkable that one of the greatest 
											medieval geographers Al Idrisi was 
											not only an Arab Muslim, but also a 
											citizen of Sicily.<a name="_ednref3" title href="#_edn3"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="justify">
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Muslim does understand 
											there is spilt between the secular 
											and spiritual. Professor Talad Assad 
											explained <i>ijtihad</i> concerning 
											the secularism comes into operation 
											precisely in the Islamic world. Are 
											there reasons for Muslims to support 
											secularism? Not as an absolute. 
											Sensitivity to the unnecessary 
											suffering that human beings on 
											fellow men has been characteristic 
											chiefly of people who are also 
											unusually sensitive to the evil of 
											imposing such suffering on other 
											people. </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="justify">
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great 
											scholars including Hasan’s notes on 
											Sharia, faith, promise etc will 
											provide several good materials for 
											the pulpit of the general rights 
											from the declaration providing 
											references from the traditional 
											Islamic scriptures. But there are 
											actions and reactions are equal as 
											writer Demi’rel explains so highly 
											of Ataturk’s push to secularization 
											in Turkey.&nbsp; Relating to maturity of 
											religion subordinates this 
											determinism to the omnipotence of a 
											God acting outside of time and 
											space. One appeals exclusively to 
											reason, the other to feeling. Even 
											early Medieval Spain also cites 
											Muslim tolerance, which was true in 
											its day. </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="justify">
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the 
											authors could not find freedom in 
											Muslim countries. But Islam’s 
											principal messages, however, are of 
											justice and peace.&nbsp; The authors have 
											surveyed the Muslims in confronting 
											democracy and communalism that have 
											led them back to the Qur’an. There 
											is the identity crisis in the Muslim 
											society the Muslim countries. Change 
											has come from within. Until that 
											happens, many of the bullies, the 
											bigots and the bad of the world will 
											listen to the cries of Islam. God 
											does not involve with time and 
											space. Human beings are limited by 
											time and space. There is a visible 
											body and invisible mind. Universal 
											love is a religion.<a name="_ednref4" title href="#_edn4"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:200%" align="justify">
											&nbsp;After violence and destruction 
											secular minds have been developing 
											in the Muslim community. Several 
											scholars observed that for Muslims, 
											every thing must be viewed through 
											the prism of the Qur’an. But Talad 
											Asad mentioned, “Even though 
											Islamism is situated in a secular 
											world – a world that is presupposed 
											by, among other things, the 
											universal space of <i>the social </i>
											that sustains the nation – state – 
											Islamism cannot be reduced to 
											nationalism.”
											<a name="_ednref5" title href="#_edn5">
											<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a> 
											It is also most remarkable that when 
											Islam is secure, independent and 
											confident, so are its nation. The 
											ideal government in a Muslim country 
											mirrors the fate of Islam.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:36.0pt;line-height:200%" align="justify">
											&nbsp;<b><u>Secular ideas in the Qur’an</u>:</b></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
											&nbsp;</p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="justify">
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secular nature of 
											humanity is underlined in the Qur’an. 
											God’s blessings and compassion take 
											in everyone, <i>all creatures</i>. 
											God or Allah can’t be only for any 
											particular religion and community. 
											Even the Qur’an declared, “You can’t 
											abuse other religion (6:109).” But 
											many Muslims and non-Muslims abuse 
											other religion. The Qur’an warned. 
											“No religious place should be 
											demolished. (22: 40).”<a name="_ednref6" title href="#_edn6"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a> 
											There are problems in understanding 
											the universal Islam and sectarian 
											Islam. There are big Islam and 
											little Islam. Little Islam creates 
											trouble between state and church. 
											Therefore, The Qur’an may t<a name="_ednref7" title href="#_edn7"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a> 
											be understood in numerous ways. 
											Universal principles apply to 
											societies through time and space. 
											Spirit of the Qur’an is universal 
											and its study is both challenging 
											and elevating. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Human traditions and civilizations 
											are fleeting and illusory, God alone 
											is real. So the Qur”an proclaimed, “ 
											Everything is perishing but His 
											face.” (28 : 88) Men who act both 
											God’s perfect God servants and His 
											perfect vicegerents. Concerning the 
											Secularism the Qur’an explained, “… 
											God loves not corruption. (2 : 
											205).”<a name="_ednref8" title href="#_edn8"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a>

											<b><u>Europe Against Islam:</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
											<i>Islam in Europe</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pages 
											159 - 181</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Professor Talal Asad wrote a famous 
											book entitled “Formations of the 
											Secular.”&nbsp; There is the writer’s 
											(Talal Asad’s) article : Europe 
											Against Islam : Islam in Europe. 
											There are two major points are given 
											below:</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(1) As we read in this chapter 
											entitled “Religious Criticism in the 
											Middle East”. Islamic societies are 
											now in crisis. Therefore, Islamic 
											tradition is in crisis. When that 
											crisis is characterized by 
											radicalism of many Islamic political 
											movements in recent times, it is not 
											a product of mainstream historical 
											tradition of Islam. It is a product 
											of the modern politics and the 
											modernizing state whose project is 
											the transformation of the totality 
											of society through the process of 
											continuing industrial, technological 
											and corporate production.</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(2) There was a state in the Muslims 
											countries but not in the modern 
											sense of the term in Islamic history 
											(or pre – modern history). There 
											were princes and dynasties (dawla is 
											extension of the classical Arabic 
											word for dynasty) whose headed 
											institutions that secured law and 
											order and that collected tax etc. 
											However, their was no state in the 
											modern sense of a sovereign 
											structure that stands apart from 
											both those who govern and those who 
											are governed which is the 
											governments duty to maintain. 
											Muslims and the western orientalists 
											who are calling for an Islamic state 
											take it for granted that politics 
											and religion were indissolubly fused 
											together during the rise of Islam in 
											the seventh century and that later 
											Muslim history has fallen away from 
											that model. This is wrong. The 
											prophet Muhammad did not seek divine 
											authority for all his political 
											actions. Many of his followers 
											argued with him and they were not 
											called apostates. He relied on his 
											ability to persuade them and on 
											personal loyalty to keep his 
											followers because he did not possess 
											coercive state institutions that 
											enforced or framed his political 
											actions. According to the Islamic 
											history it was Abu Bakr who was 
											first turned against fellow Muslims 
											in a military way and then insisted 
											that they had to be subordinated to 
											a centralized political authority in 
											the form of an Islamic prince. But 
											the principle of subordination to an 
											Islamic prince does not constitute 
											an Islamic state in the modern 
											sense. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Talal Asad gives the example of how 
											Europeans have picked up on the 
											division of the world of into the 
											“House of Islam” and the “House of 
											Unbelief or of War” that is found in 
											the Islamic legal tradition. 
											Europeans have used this as a way to 
											question how loyal Muslims in Europe 
											can be to non - Muslim government 
											and non-Muslim political structures. 
											In other words, that European 
											Muslims can be loyal to the European 
											states in which they live. Talal 
											Asad makes these points in arguing 
											against the association of Muslims’ 
											politics with an essential or 
											original politico – religious Islam.
											</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Referring to this example of legal 
											tradition (that of the division of 
											between the House of Islam and the 
											House of Unbelief or war) in order 
											to question the loyalty of Muslim 
											European citizens implies several 
											things. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(1) That Muslims are going to be 
											guided by ancient legal tenants 
											(Shari’a) even if have no 
											institutional backing in Europe. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(2) That Muslims are not open to 
											reinterpretations of these tenants 
											or principles even though the 
											Christians have been able 
											reinterpret their legal traditions. 
											(3) It ignores the fact that large 
											numbers of colonial Muslims in 
											Africa and Asia have lived as 
											subjects of European governments. 
											And only very rarely has their 
											opposition to these governments 
											invoked these doctrines.</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											&nbsp;(4) Any attempt to demand the 
											absolute and exclusive loyalty of 
											Muslim immigrants by European 
											Nationalists ignores the bankers, 
											trade – unionists, intellectuals, 
											scientists and artists that have 
											personal and professional 
											attachments that transcend the 
											borders of the nation state. Jews 
											and Catholics and recent immigrants 
											all have loyalties that are not 
											completely contained by the 
											constitutional demands of the nation 
											state. Why should Muslims in Europe 
											be different? </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											<b><u>Formations of the Secular</u>:&nbsp;
											</b><i>Christianity, Islam &amp; 
											Modernity.</i>&nbsp; Pages 181 - 205</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Talal Asad remarks that Muslims are 
											present in Europe and yet absent 
											from it. What does he mean? The 
											incorporation of Muslims in European 
											society (even to U.S.A. or North 
											American Society) is thought be very 
											difficult because Muslims are 
											brought up in a culture that is 
											foreign. European nationalists 
											believe that Muslims cannot commit 
											themselves to the values of modern 
											Western principles because of their 
											attachment of Muslims to Islam. For 
											example, this belief has been 
											aggravated by the following three 
											examples:</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(a) The Islamic rejection of the 
											principle of secular republicanism 
											the kind of secular republicanism 
											that is present in France, which is 
											most vividly exemplified by “ <i>I 
											affaire du foulard.”&nbsp; </i>&nbsp;</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(b) By the Islamic rejection of the 
											freedom of speech as exemplified in 
											the Salman Rushdie Affair.</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											&nbsp;(c) By the rise of violence in 
											North Africa. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											These events have led even the most 
											liberals who stand for tolerance and 
											for an open society; to question 
											whether Muslims can indeed by 
											accommodated into European society. 
											So how can contemporary Europe 
											represent a culturally diverse 
											society in which Muslim migrants are 
											now taking on an increasing role?
											</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											To answer this question we have to 
											understand first how is Europe 
											defined and represented by those who 
											consider themselves to be authentic 
											Europeans and what kind of universe 
											does Europe represent to Europeans. 
											There are some contradictions in 
											Europe’s sense of uniqueness and 
											privilege. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											If Muslims civil disobedience 
											threatens the very core of Europe or 
											what it is to be a European do the 
											military conquests and genocidal 
											policies of the Nazi state.&nbsp; For 
											example also problem -making 
											Germany’s European-ness or European 
											– like mentality? Does the 
											continuing and extreme violence 
											between and within European states 
											delude their European-ness?</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Is the Bosnian community external to 
											the essence of Europe so that we 
											constantly hear about the 
											co-existence of the Muslim community 
											of Bosnians with the rest of 
											Europeans? Even when they&nbsp; (Bosnian 
											Muslims) live in a secularized 
											society? </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Then I have the argument, why did 
											Muslims expel from the narrative of 
											what Europe is? How is the narrative 
											of Europe based on a non – 
											negotiable essence?</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											There are ten most important points 
											are listed &amp; given below:</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(1) Europe is considered not merely 
											a continent but more importantly, it 
											is considered civilization whose key 
											influences have been the Roman 
											Empire, Christianity, the 
											Enlightenment and industrialization. 
											(2) European history is the history 
											of European or Western civilization, 
											homogenous space and linear time. 
											What do belong to Europe are things 
											that are taken up and creatively 
											worked or elaborated by Europe. In 
											other words, things belong to Europe 
											because Europeans appropriate them 
											and cultivate them. So, European 
											history has to the history of what 
											Europe has appropriated. (2) 
											Europeans obtain their individual 
											identity from the character of 
											European civilization and not the 
											other way round. European 
											civilization is not formed by the 
											character of the individual 
											identities of its citizens. That’s 
											why not all individuals in Europe 
											are <i>real</i> or full Europeans. 
											Russian and Bosnian Muslims, 
											European Jews are extremely marginal 
											Europeans. Medieval Spain is being 
											seen as outside Europe. (The 
											medieval Europe, pura-sangre, 
											mysticism in Spain afterwards, 
											French calls it Africa).</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(4) With respect to Medieval Spain 
											and the Arabian culture as well as 
											civilization that were founded 
											there, it is never looked at 
											something that was proper to the 
											Arab cultures. &nbsp;Arabic numerals are 
											said to be really Indian. Therefore 
											Arabs carried all sciences, 
											mathematics and etc. into Spain. But 
											Muslims could not get any credit for 
											the scientific contribution. 
											European appreciated Greek, not 
											Muslim, not Islamic as such was 
											carried into Europe where Aquinas 
											with the help of other Europeans 
											made it Christians and therefore 
											European. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(5) Despite Islam’s long presence in 
											Europe, it is being opposed to that 
											of Europe and simultaneously of 
											Christianity. And it is represented 
											as (a) attempting to suppress 
											Europe’s spiritual and material 
											power (b) as the corrupting 
											environment in which Europe must 
											struggle to overcome. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											&nbsp;(6) Europe’s colonial past is not 
											understood as a time of oversees 
											power that is now absolutely over. 
											It is part of the reason that Europe 
											has become what it is today. It is 
											not possible to represent Europe 
											without calling up this history.</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											&nbsp;(7) The European Community’s slogan
											<i>unity in diversity</i> reflects 
											the understanding that there is a 
											single history that encompasses 
											European civilization.</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											(8) European borders are said to 
											separate civilized culture from 
											violent culture. Violent culture 
											remains outside of Europe in which 
											is inherently or essentially non – 
											violent.</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											&nbsp;(9) Minorities are defined 
											histories of exclusion in which are 
											still relevant today. Even at the 
											situation of France, where Le Pen 
											(leader of the extreme right wing 
											opposition) led his whole campaign 
											on the right of France to remain 
											French to protect its distinctive 
											character, its republican and 
											Jacobin ideals.</p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											&nbsp;(10) The majority’s right to be 
											French precludes the minority’s 
											rights to equal treatment. “We not 
											only have the right but the duty to 
											defend our national personality and 
											we too have our right to be 
											different.” It is also remarkable 
											that to be a French citizen is to be 
											an individual a collective 
											personality that was founded in the 
											French Revolution and is embodied in 
											the French Republic. Readers 
											observed complex space, critical 
											time and multiple traditions. </p>

											<b><u>Secularism &amp; Dr. Fazlur 
											Rahman:</u></b></p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0pt" align="justify">
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Dr. Fazlur 
											Rahman explained his ideas on the 
											secularism in his book entitled 
											“Islam and Modernity.” The subtitle 
											of the book : <i>Transformation of 
											an Intellectual Tradition</i>. The 
											author encouraged the readers to 
											work with time, what is subject to 
											change. Blind attachment towards 
											religious books and ideas create 
											violence in our daily life of today. 
											It is also most remarkable that 
											Professor Fazlur Rahman has made a 
											perspective analysis in his book 
											entitle <i>Islam and Modernity</i>. 
											He asserted that the conservative 
											Ulema of today are far more 
											uncompromisingly conservative than 
											their predecessors of the 17<sup>th</sup> 
											or 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. Even 
											the teaching of Arabic had been 
											banned by the reforming zeal of 
											Ataturk, hence the only link with 
											Islam left was the Ottoman language 
											and the ottoman history and older 
											sciences that had been enshrined in 
											the language.”

											book. In all communities, even in 
											those days that are or claim to be 
											based directly on a religious vision

											society, there are always 
											indifferent or secular forces, and 
											Muslim society is no exception. </p>

											According to the secularists and

											These are various pre-Islamic or

											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											There are many higher educated&nbsp;&nbsp;

											Muslim world. There is a new 
											approach re-interpreting religious

											Afshari writes,&nbsp; “My fear is that

											reinterpretation, like the state’s

											<b><u>Conclusion </u></b>: <i>A 
											Timely Nobel Message to the Muslim 
											World.</i></p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Truth triumphs alone. Ethics don’t 
											come in packages of religion. Iran’s 
											respected female professor of Law 
											Mrs. Shirin Ebadi, first female 
											justice of Iran, drew praise for 
											championing of Human Rights, 
											international law, democracy, 
											secularism, displaced refugees, 
											children and the community 
											development. As she&nbsp; (Iranian 
											Advocate) was announced the awarding 
											of the 2003 Peace Prize to the&nbsp; Law 
											Professor (of the University of 
											Tehran ) of peace working to defuse 
											conflicts in Iran. Sincere Muslims 
											have protested against the terrorism 
											at anywhere of the world. This is 
											the first time in our history 
											Western society paid respects to the 
											Iranian Muslim lady who is a secular 
											and dedicated to secularism and 
											Human Rights. Man biologically is 
											one species. Out of compassion for 
											the world, the Nobel laureate 
											indicated that good and bad 
											qualities are not the monopoly of 
											one class or religion. And how men 
											and women have to judge by the 
											standard of righteousness and 
											secularism. This is a timely Nobel 
											message to the Muslim world. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											Implementation of dynamic concepts 
											in the field of secular and 
											secularism in Islam requires 
											efficient debating and negotiating 
											efforts. It is essential now to use 
											it more efficiently. Far from being 
											a matter of form, the institutional 
											and the procedural aspects of the 
											negotiating bodies have a direct 
											impact on the very contact of the 
											work. They may provide or on the 
											contrary, deprive the negotiating 
											machinery of the necessary 
											instruments to mobilize the 
											political will of Muslim and non 
											Muslim States. In this respect, the 
											conduct of negotiations outside 
											political alliances, which by 
											definition stimulate mistrust and 
											confrontation, is of special 
											importance. </p>
											<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" align="justify">
											This goal can only be reached by the 
											mobilization of governments, 
											political organizations and social 
											forces favoring secularism in Islam. 
											Every Muslim and non - Muslim 
											institution can make a major 
											contribution to developing 
											international action in order to 
											reach this goal. </p>
