											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ethno-religious and Dalits 
											minorities in India are subjected to 
											relentless persecution and 
											unspeakable violence. Reader’s voice 
											can help to put an end to this 
											continuing saga of violence, 
											persecution (in the name of Vedic 
											Caste system:1. Brahmin 2. Kshatriya 
											3. Vaishya and 4. Shudra), and 
											relating to crimes against the 
											humanity. Recently India gets its 
											first Dalit chief justice K. G. 
											Balkrishnan –who becomes the first 
											Dalit – the former untouchables who 
											are the lowest in India’s caste 
											hierarchy, to rise to the position 
											of the highest dispenser of justice 
											in India. Indian news media reported 
											on racist slurs on the humanitarian 
											aspects of Indian wisdom not only 
											free men from all castes and 
											different backgrounds and enjoy 
											equal status as followers of the 
											non-violence. So we have to 
											remember, “Rare is birth as human 
											being, hard is the life of mortals, 
											do not let slip this opportunity.”&nbsp; 
											This is the message of humanity here 
											and now.</p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
											In 1927 Dr. Ambedkar publicly burned 
											the Manusmriti itself.&nbsp; It is quite 
											wrong that the India’s Supreme Court 
											and the ancient religious system 
											tolerate racist abuse and behavior 
											from Brahmins mafia and rulers and 
											we believe it is as issue that 
											should be addressed immediately by 
											today’s Hindu professors, 
											intellectuals, enlightened minds, 
											monks, scholars and Government of 
											India. </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
											Recently racist slurs against Dalits 
											– the oppressed people of South 
											Asian in Indian newspapers caste war 
											in Maharashtra” news reports have 
											snowballed into a major row of Dalit 
											communities at home and abroad. 
											Misunderstood towards any religions 
											is a curse to mankind. In caste 
											society a young widow become a 
											victim of ridiculous customs made 
											her an outcast or people are 
											oppressed. Despite movies including
											<i>the Water</i> and <i>the Baabul
											</i>widow remarriage still a far 
											cry. Films have not achieved much 
											success in changing the attitude of 
											caste people towards widows. Caste’s 
											old customs and belief are still 
											deeply rooted in the Indian society. 
											According to a survey conducted by 
											India’s national census in 2001, 
											there were more than 34 million 
											widows. The 1856 Hindu Widows’ 
											Remarriage Act gave women the legal 
											right to remarry and the Hindu 
											Succession Act of 1956 gave women 
											the same inheritance rights as men. 
											However, those rights are rarely put 
											into practice. But Hindu politicians 
											are proud of women power and pray to 
											Goddess Durga, Kali and Laxmi. 
											Unfortunately, their widows are 
											still seen as a curse. Without 
											compassion and wisdom any religion 
											including Hinduism is a curse to 
											mankind. There is a book entitled 
											“Untouchables” by Narendra Jadhav. 
											When the ‘Caste’ meets with the 
											ocean of mankind then man is a 
											mysterious being with inconceivable 
											potentialities. </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
											Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar (1891 – 1956) 
											M.A., PHD., D.Sc. LL.D., DLITT., 
											Barrister-at-law&nbsp; is the father 
											(Babasahed) of the Dalits or human 
											beings oppressed who have no human 
											rights in India. He encouraged us 
											that human right is a moral issue, 
											not a political football.&nbsp; He 
											defended the 250 million Dalits who 
											have been inspired by the message of 
											Dr.Ambekar.&nbsp; Brahmin mafia and caste 
											Hindus socio- political surroundings 
											tend to generate doubt and hatred 
											towards the Dalits or untouchables. 
											Ambedkar has discovered for Dalits 
											the way to freedom. Later he became 
											the champion of human rights, 
											liberator of the Dalits, Minister of 
											Law and <b>principal architect of 
											India’s constitution.</b> He was 
											inspired to heal the poor Dalits’ 
											wounds after millennium years. 
											Ambedkar’s single most important 
											quality was the ability to make bold 
											decision to be converted as 
											Buddhists with 500, 000 people in 
											Nagpur dated October 14, 1956 for 
											the welfare of the oppressed. 
											Buddhism was originated in the Indus 
											civilization and Vedic history 
											misrepresented Buddhism that Gautama 
											Buddha only one Buddha of its Hindu 
											God. Buddhism opens its universal 
											door to all to create a 
											compassionate society on the Earth.
											</p>
											<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 
											Chairman of the drafting committee 
											of the Constitution, Ambedkar did 
											his job with both distinction and 
											efficiency. In the last session of 
											the assembly, he was showered with 
											extravagant praise. In the cultural 
											sphere, the conflict between 
											tradition and modernity offers 
											interesting challenges, and the need 
											for building a new style of life 
											drawing on traditional values, and 
											yet meeting new exigencies is an 
											issue facing all religions. Above 
											the observations, we have to 
											understand on the human nature 
											orientations become equally 
											relevant, specially the search for 
											an ethic of permanence and peace.</p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
											Change has to come from within. 
											Until that happens many of the 
											bullies, the bigots and the bad of 
											the world will listen to the cries 
											of human beings in India. Later 30<sup>th</sup> 
											November 2006 during protests across 
											Maharastra following the alleged 
											destruction of Bharatratna Dr. B. R. 
											Ambedkar’s (1891 – 1956) statue in 
											Kanpur. Several months ago killing 
											of a Dalit family at the village of 
											Khairlanji situated in the Bhandra 
											district. Justice was denied and 
											persecution directly conducted by 
											district authority and caste 
											politicians. Dalit people regret to 
											say that the Maharashtra 
											government’s response to this 
											genocidal campaign appears to be 
											negligible and higher officers of 
											government authority have done 
											nothing to stop the killings, rapes, 
											brutality and intimidation that 
											continue to be meted out to the 
											Dalit population of India. Caste 
											religious fanatic people including 
											public administrative systems have 
											created a wrangle. They behaved like 
											insurgents, making sneak attack on 
											the security of Dalit Buddhists in 
											India. In this incident only, which 
											amount to the concealment of the 
											Dalits’ problem do not end. It will 
											grow more and more seriously until 
											at the end is beyond remedy. The 
											responsible authorities have already 
											done it this way generation to 
											generation in the ancient tragedy of 
											the caste system in India. </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
											In Mandrayar’s film each character 
											represents a different kind of widow 
											abuse that is still experienced 
											different levels of tortures: (1) 
											social ostracism (2) abandonment by 
											children (3) raped by in-laws and 
											(4) sexual exploitation by Hindu 
											priests, Brahmin Mafia, and 
											politicians.&nbsp; All human beings want 
											peace and happiness in their daily 
											lives. Hinduism means (Om Santi) 
											peace in mind and external world.&nbsp; 
											But power hungry Hindu politicians 
											made it as their weapon to kill 
											fellow human beings in a name of 
											religion.&nbsp; </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
											Bihar’s fertile soil is rich in 
											mineral resources, but the rulers 
											oppress the poor peoples who have no 
											any power. They are exploited, 
											tortured and persecuted by private 
											armies and local police. There can 
											be no peace for man as he desires 
											and thirst. Offensiveness alone does 
											not amount to hate and violent 
											responses to offended sensibilities 
											cannot justify the suppression of 
											Dalits. Murder, extermination, 
											enslavement, deportation and other 
											inhuman acts done against any 
											civilian population, or persecutions 
											on political, racial or religious 
											grounds, when such acts are done or 
											in execution or connection with any 
											crime against peace. We want India 
											to be seen round the world as a 
											country of fairness and a country of 
											tolerance. The Indian government is 
											accountable on the Dalit killings 
											field in India issue as it is an 
											arrangement with an individual, but 
											the government is committed against 
											racism. </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
											As the India’s Ambedkar Mission 
											reported that Indian nation will pay 
											homage to Bharat Ratna Babahsahed 
											Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on his 106 
											birthday anniversary on April 14, 
											2007 in India and abroad and people 
											from all walks of life will pay 
											homage to Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on this 
											auspicious occasion. We have to 
											remember that Hindus are brothers 
											and sisters of Dalits. All human 
											beings are our relatives and cousins 
											irrespective of religions, color, 
											political systems and geographical 
											boundaries. </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
											Recently peace loving people all 
											over the world will have been 
											shocked upon reading the news in 
											your Weekly Voice and its headline 
											was “Hindu Judge Takes Oath with 
											Quranic Prayer” dated March 31, 
											2007. There is freedom of religions 
											according to the constitution of the 
											Islamic Republic of Pakistan. In the 
											Holy Qur’ran’s Sura Bakhara no. 213 
											All Mighty Allah declares, “ALL 
											HUMAN BEINGS ARE IN A ONE NATION.” 
											But the Pakistan Government divides 
											humanity in a name of universal 
											ISLAM. Islam is not domestic way of 
											selfish reason, it is universal. 
											Anyone finds light in Islam. But the 
											political greedy minds destroy 
											universal love and compassionate 
											meaning of Islam. But Pakistan 
											Supreme Court abused the power of 
											Islam as a Hindu judge Rana 
											Bhagawan’s oath reciting, 
											“Bismillah” as the Pakistan news 
											media reported. Water is pani or 
											different names in different 
											languages but essence is one. God, 
											Allah, Bhagavan,etc mean only the 
											Truth or All mighty. Today’s 
											Pakistan does get any historical 
											lesson relating to why did East 
											Pakistan become Bangladesh? Racism 
											creates all problems. There are no 
											genuine and elected democratic 
											systems in Pakistan. Pakistan 
											government has no right to abuse 
											humanity in the name of Islam. Being 
											a Muslim is state of universal mind. 
											Some locked in war raging around 
											political and ethnic identity. 
											Concerning the secularism in Islam 
											Professor Talat Asad explained, “The 
											word (secular or alamaniyy) yields 
											the abstract noun almaniyyah to mean 
											secularism in Islam.” Our great 
											Prophet declared in his last sermon, 
											there is no superiority for an Arab 
											over a non-Arab nor for a non-Arab 
											over an Arab.” </p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in">
											Is there is rule of law in India? If 
											so, the triumph over prejudice and 
											ignorance is a triumph for us all. 
											Humanity is like the ocean. Indian 
											caste system could not divide it in 
											the name of religion and the Supreme 
											Court in the Buddha’s land of 
											compassion and wisdom. Why the 
											Indian Supreme Court Suspends Caste 
											Quota Plan? As the Indian News media 
											reported that the Supreme Court 
											suspended on March 29 a government 
											policy to reserve more college 
											places for lower castes, a plan that 
											had sparked protests from students 
											around the country. There are no 
											human rights in the caste system of 
											Indian society. Caste system is the 
											root of all evils in India. Why so? 
											Racism should be opposed in all 
											forms including India’s caste 
											system.</p>
