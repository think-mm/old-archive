		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The 
		members of the generation who were mere children during our liberation 
		war and who finished their major parts of their schooling in the post 
		1975 era and the generation afterwards are deprived of the true history 
		of our liberation war. As a member of one of such generations, I 
		consciously feel &nbsp;how the misguided distorted history has succeeded to 
		rot us dividing the nation into pro and anti liberation<i> shibirs</i>. 
		This, in turn, politically put the country in a turmoil and volatile 
		state as we perceive now. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">
		&nbsp;1971 united the whole nation (except a few collaborators of the 
		Pakistani army) with the spirit of liberation war. People of all walks 
		of life became freedom fighters in one way or another. Some actively 
		joined the war and millions other, though did not take part directly in 
		the war, gave moral support to our war of independence. These are the 
		people, in fact, are the silent freedom fighters among whom many 
		sacrificed their lives, wealth and efforts for the great cause. In 
		essence we may claim that the emergence of Bangladesh was possible due 
		to the collective efforts of the people of the soil. So, naturally, 
		after the liberation, these collective efforts should have led 
		Bangladesh to a prosperous one, following the spirit of the liberation 
		war as envisioned by many. Ironically, Bangladesh has miserably failed 
		to achieve the very objective of the liberation.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">To 
		unveil the causes behind this failure, we need to shed light on the 15<sup>th</sup> 
		August, 1975, the blackest day of our national history. The 15<sup>th</sup> 
		August, 1975 can be marked as a turning point for our country, from the 
		light to the dark-- from the hope to the despair. On this day, with the 
		brutal killing of Bangabondhu Sheikh Mujib, the monumental icon of 
		independence and founding father of Bangladesh, the nation had to burry 
		all the spirits of the liberation war. So, in the independent 
		Bangladesh, in 1975 the freedom fighters were defeated and the enemy of 
		the liberation war, the collaborators of the Pakistani army won 
		reversing the history by implementing their well designed conspiracy!&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">
		Customarily history of a country is written by the victors, if we 
		closely analyse then it can be ascertained. For instance, the British 
		historians, during the reign of the British Raj assailed the character 
		of Nawab Sirajuddoula of Bengal objectively. Nawab Sirajuddoula as a 
		vanguard of the independent Bengal in 1757 AD fought against the East 
		India Company, the forerunner of the British regime. Unfortunate defeat 
		of Sirajuddowla and the victory of the Robert Clive led the British 
		regime to write the biased history demeaning Siraj and his associates. 
		Similarly, the victors of 1975, the defeated forces of 1971 of 
		Bangladesh objectively distorted the history, especially that of our 
		liberation war. In fact, the enemy of our country, the collaborators of 
		Pakistani occupying forces are very shrewd. And so after the fall of the 
		patriotic freedom fighters in 1975, they started to fabricate the 
		history of liberation in their own ways. Indeed they were aware of the 
		implication of the history and its long term impact on the nation. They 
		knew that the exposure of the true history of our liberation war would 
		trash them in the dustbin and eventually they never would be able to 
		come to the power centre. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The 
		process of history distortions has been initiated during post Mujib era, 
		especially in the texts of school and college. They knew that if the new 
		generations, who have not witnessed the war of independence could be 
		kept in the dark concerning our history of the liberation then one day 
		they would be in a state of success. Their forecast has been deemed to 
		be true at the later phases. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The 
		new generations have learned the biased history in the text books as 
		fabricated by the victors of 1975. This history has not revealed all the 
		truth; rather it has created smokescreens surrounding 1971, the glorious 
		event of the Bengali nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in our history text in the 
		school, we have read the freedom fighters fought against the occupying 
		forces in 1971, but who were the occupying forces, there is no answer 
		there. Similarly in the text we have seen the role of Sheikh Mujib in 
		the liberation war is limited to only two or three sentences. Rather the 
		role of the late president General Ziaur Rahman (the then major of the 
		Pakistan Army) has been overemphasised depicting him as the key 
		organiser of our war of independence. This over emphasis has been marked 
		to such an extent that one may think that unless Zia declared the 
		proclamation of our independence, the emergence of Bangladesh would not 
		be possible. Shamelessly our history text deleted the fact that Ziaur 
		Rahman announced the said proclamation on behalf of Sheikh Mujib. (Even 
		if Ziaur Rahman were alive then he must have been felt ashamed realising 
		this fabrication of the history!) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">
		Again the text of our history books in the school has not revealed the 
		roles of Jamat-i-islami and its infamous leaders like Golam Azam, Motiur 
		Rahman Nizami, and Al Mujahid who notoriously collaborated with the 
		Pakistani army in 1971. Even studying the history in our student life we 
		have not learned the role of the former president General Ershad in our 
		liberation war who as a chairman of a special tribunal in Lahore 
		cantonment tried the freedom fighters from the stranded Bengali army in 
		the then West Pakistan who tried to flee to India with a view to 
		participating in our war of independence. Had the true roles of the 
		above stated heinous people in our liberation war &nbsp;been &nbsp;reflected in 
		the text of the history then certainly they had not been able to come to 
		the power centre of the country.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Our 
		history courses, in our student life has utterly failed to teach us the 
		background and the spirit of the liberation war. This history has not 
		indicated that the war of independence was in fact a continual struggle 
		from 1952 to 1971. Our history texts either at the school or at the 
		college levels have not focussed on the historical 6 points or 11 points 
		demands which can be regarded as the charters of independence. The 
		fabricated history does not address the Agartala Conspiracy case against 
		Sheikh Mujib which in turn transformed him into Bangabondhu. Even in the 
		history which we have learned in our student life has not indicated the 
		significance of the address of the 7<sup>th</sup> March of Bangabondhu 
		which can be compared with the address of Gettysburg delivered by 
		Abraham Lincoln, the great leader of America.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">
		Nationalism, secularism and socialism were the major spirits of our 
		liberation war. Abandoning the much hatred two nation theory in 1971, 
		people of this land embraced the Bengali nationalism and secularism as 
		basic mantras for the salvation. But in our history texts this reality 
		has not been reflected at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The 
		manipulated history as designed by the beneficiaries of 1975 and the 
		collaborators of 1971 has successfully confused the generations. Perhaps 
		due to this confused state, the people from the younger generations who 
		missed to be witnesses of 1971 voted and elected (as the lion share of 
		the voters are from these generations) &nbsp;the identified collaborators of 
		1971 as the members of the Parliament. For the same reason people did 
		not raise their voice much when the war criminals like Motiur Rahman 
		Nizami or Al Mujahid emerged as ministers in the last alliance 
		government.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The 
		change in 1/11 and subsequent vibrant utterance of the army chief 
		General M U Ahmed have instigated rays of hope among the conscious 
		citizen of the country. The incumbent army chief has categorically 
		mentioned the urgency of honouring Bangabondhu at the state level as 
		well as the installation of the true history of the liberation war. 
		Moreover, pointing at the war criminals of 1971 he has also become vocal 
		to bring them behind the bar. However, we are not sure whether his 
		utterances are merely a political stunt or these reflect his sincere 
		obligation to the nation. Only the time will reveal the truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
