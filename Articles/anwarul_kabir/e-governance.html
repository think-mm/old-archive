		Introduction: </font><br>
		In 1999, during my way back to Bangladesh from the UK , the immigration 
		officer at Heathrow while checking my passport looked at his computer 
		screen and suddenly asked me “Did you lose your passport?... anyway, you 
		got it afterward.” Instantly, I could not remember the event. However, 
		in one or two minutes I could recall that once I put my passport in a 
		bag inside the boot of my uncle’s car and later I forgot to collect it 
		duly. After a few days, when I needed the passport, my memory completely 
		betrayed me to locate the passport. In despair, I phoned the Home Office 
		(immigration department) that I lost my passport. Luckily, within few 
		days, my passport was discovered from the boot while the car was being 
		cleaned. Accordingly, I informed the Home Office immigration department 
		that my passport was found. The very objective of sharing my personal 
		experience is just to shed light on how effective and efficient 
		Information storing and retrieval systems could be implemented and 
		operated by the government organ to deal with its client.<br>
		<br>
		During 1995-96 as I worked as casual interpreter for the British Home 
		Office, I had close contact with some personnel working there who 
		facilitated me to observe the part of their information system closely. 
		Being a software engineer, I was really amazed at the design strategy of 
		their distributed database system. In designing, they could successfully 
		align the system with the mission and vision of the Home Office. Even 10 
		years back from now, strategically, they emphasized on the concept of 
		e-governance in designing their system. They realized that the 
		implemented systems would not be only for the internal use for the Home 
		Office personnel. They had the vision that eventually their system would 
		be used by many other government organs including concerned citizens of 
		the country. I believe, their system has gained maturity with the 
		support of more efficient cutting edge technologies by this time.<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#0000FF">e-Governance Revisit: <br>
		</font>With the advent of Internet technology (more technically wide use 
		of TCP/IP protocol) in the early part of the last decade of the last 
		century, the developed countries coined the concept of e-governance. The 
		policy makers of the developed countries envisioned that new 
		developments in ICT and especially the TCP/IP protocol would pay a 
		significant contribution in achieving objectives of good governance. So, 
		the term e-Governance can be defined as efficient and effective use of 
		modern ICT technology with a view to establishing good governance for 
		any country. From the management and technological perceptions, the 
		e-governance can also be defined as Electronic State Management System 
		based on information and communication technologies (ICT), including the 
		Internet technology.<br>
		<br>
		Broadly, the government, citizen and business concerns (which include 
		NGOs, corporate and also different professional bodies) are the three 
		major actors in the e-government as shown in the figure. Depending on 
		their interactions components of e-governance can be featured as 
		follows:<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#0000FF">1. G2C (Government to Citizen): </font>deals with 
		interaction between individual citizens with the government. Examples of 
		G2C are payment of utility bills or applying for passports through 
		relevant website of the e-Governance system. Good governance always 
		stresses on participatory and democracy concepts. Citizen should not be 
		isolated from the government. Using appropriate website of the system 
		citizen can also be interactive in different development processes of 
		the government.<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#0000FF">2. G2B (Government-to-Business):</font> involves 
		interaction of the business establishments with the government. These 
		business establishments may be corporate, NGOs or other professional 
		bodies. The example of G2B is submission of tax assessment by any 
		business establishment to the department of Taxation of the government 
		through the Internet.<br>
		<br>
		<font color="#0000FF">3. G2G (Government-to-Government): </font>involves 
		interaction among government officials, whether within a government 
		office or within different organs of the government. The example pf G2G 
		may be a request of allocation of budget by any department of the 
		government<br>
		<br>
		Ultimate objective of e-Governance is to establish a good governance. 
		The attributes of the good governance can be identified as follows: a. 
		Honesty b. Efficiency and Effectiveness (in terms of time space and 
		money) c. Justice d. Reliability e. Participatory and Democracy f. 
		Accountability g. Accessibility and Transparency h. equity i. visionary 
		in decision making. All of these attributes can be achieved through 
		proper implementation of e-governance using the state of the art 
		technologies.<br>
		<br>
		It has been proved that the corruption levels in the public sector have 
		dramatically fallen in the countries where e-Governance has been 
		initiated. <font color="#FF0000">A survey in India has revealed that the 
		states where e-governance has been established even partially, the 
		corruption rate has dramatically reduced. The survey has found that in 
		Kolkata and Mumbai, due to implementation of e-Governance in some public 
		sectors, the corruption rates have declined to 19% and 18% compared to 
		51% and 38% respectively in 2000. </font><font color="#0000FF">Even in 
		Bangladesh we may observe that due to computerization of Railway 
		Reservation System, the number of black-marketers (middle men who used 
		to involve in illegal ticket selling) has reduced significantly. </font>
		Elimination of the middle men in citizen-government interaction, in 
		fact, is the major factor that acts in eradicating corruption levels. 
		Again in the government offices, if the people interact with the 
		government organs through web-page then colonial red tapes practices 
		will be totally removed. This in turn will reduce the pervasive bribery 
		practices in government offices.<br>
		<br>
		The computerization of the system speeds up the performance in terms of 
		time, reliability, efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, had a 
		proper e-Governance system implemented then a person would have easily 
		applied for a new passport using his digital signature and citizenship 
		identifier and got the passport ready within 24 hours without paying any 
		urgent/very urgent fee or taking any other hassle. It would be possible 
		if we consider a complete integrated e-Government system. Issuance of a 
		new passport requires many processes (e.g. police verification, 
		validation of Birth certificate). In an e-Governance environment, as all 
		the departments of the government are virtually integrated, when the 
		person applies for a passport through Website of the passport and 
		immigration department, the specific data stated by the applicant will 
		be sent to the relevant departments instantly for cross checking and 
		validation. As for example, for getting police clearance, data provided 
		by the applicant will be cross checked with police department’s data and 
		a report (either positive or negative) will be generated automatically 
		and sent to the server of the Passport and Immigration department 
		office. Subsequently in the server of the Passport and Immigration 
		department receiving the person’s application and report as required 
		from various departments system will decide automatically whether the 
		person is eligible to receive the new passport or not. Even the printing 
		process of the passport can be automated. So, because of the minimum 
		involvement of the middleman in this case, the corruption and hassles in 
		receiving passport will be approximately at zero level compared with the 
		present scenario in Bangladesh.<br>
		<br>
		e-Governance confirms the active participation of the people in the 
		process of establishing democracy norms in the country. Unfortunate 
		incidence that occurred in Phulbari, centering the coal mine contract 
		with the Asia Energy could be avoided if e-Governance environment 
		prevailed here. Prior to contract with Asia Energy, the government could 
		take opinion from the local people through Website on this issue. On the 
		same issue a Website discussion group could have been formed which would 
		make the government transparent in decision making. By the people’s 
		active participation, some pro-people positive decision would come out 
		considering the country’s resource constraints, local environment, and 
		other socio-political issues.<br>
		<br>
		e-Governance leads to e-Democracy too. For instance, in an e-Governance 
		environment, any political party can be able to select the possible 
		candidate for the election democratically if it has its own Website 
		(this is also a component of e-Governance) by seeking opinion through 
		website. This selection will reflect the opinion of the common people 
		and thus will reduce the impact of black money in the selection of the 
		candidature.<br>
		<br>
		Right now we are observing enormous wastage of public money in preparing 
		politically biased error-prone voter list. However, in e-Governance 
		environment, as the citizens’ basic record database is one of the vital 
		components, it is easily possible to generate a flawless unbiased voter 
		list with the latest status of the citizen (e.g. age, present address) 
		in any time without spending any additional money.<br>
		<br>
		Accessibility to information for all is the prime concern of the 
		e-governance. The citizen must have access to e-Governance. In reality, 
		availability and non-availability of information creates the digital gap 
		among different segments of the people in a society which is the one of 
		the major causes of non-equity and social injustice. If everybody gets 
		the same extent of accessibility to e-Governance then the class distance 
		among the different groups in the society will be minimized abruptly.<br>
		<br>
		e-Governance reality in Bangladesh: As a nation we are like empty 
		vessel—we talk too much but do little in practice. When the buzz word 
		e-Commerce started to get its popularity, many of our ICT giant paid 
		much attention to it by organizing seminars, workshops etc. Accordingly, 
		they persuaded the policy makers of the government and in 2001 they 
		formed a ICT Task force headed by the incumbent Prime Minister Begum 
		Khaleda Zia for introducing e-Governance in Bangladesh. Apparently, 
		assessing their propaganda it was assumed that the government would 
		implement e-Governance overnight. However, over the five years, 
		insignificant progress has been marked so far. Other than Planning 
		Commission and ministry of finance, no other ministry could implement 
		any significant software systems even for their internal use. Some 
		ministries (e.g. ministry of Science and Technology) have created some 
		static Websites with a view to disseminating information to public. As 
		this Websites are not interactive, there is no scope for active 
		participation of the concerned people. Moreover, as these Websites have 
		not been updated regularly, they mislead public with backdated 
		information.<br>
		<br>
		In e-Governance environment all governmental organizations should have 
		networked and interconnected. This connectivity facilitates to exchange 
		information among different organs of the government without any manual 
		intervention. Ideally, for this, we need to build up IOS (Inter 
		Organizational Systems) or EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) software. 
		Unfortunately, till to date all software systems that developed in our 
		governments’ various organizations are discrete in nature and so they do 
		not support inter-departmental or inter-organizational data sharing 
		technique.<br>
		<br>
		Computerization and e-Governance are not synonymous. In fact, over the 
		five years, computerization processes in some ministries or government 
		sectors have been initiated. But truly speaking it is not e-Governance. 
		We have to go a long way to implement e-Governance in our country.<br>
		<br>
		Road Map to e-Governance: This is true that available resources for 
		e-Governance in Bangladesh are inadequate. The low fixed telephone 
		density is one of the major barriers to digital communications (which 
		paves way to Internet communication). However, rapid growth of mobile 
		telephonic network presumably overcomes this barrier. Besides, we can 
		also use the underused optic fiber network of the railway department for 
		this purpose. For global connectivity for e-Governance, submarine cable 
		connection will play a significant role if we use it appropriately.<br>
		<br>
		For establishing e-Governance in Bangladesh, ICT infrastructure can be 
		built step by step even at village level, if we have a Road Map or 
		master plan for e-Governance using our limited resources.<br>
		<br>
		Decentralization of distributed database is one of the essential 
		features of the e-Governance. Decentralized or localized database 
		ensures autonomy as well as reduces traffic loads in network 
		communication. Keeping this in mind, we need to design e-Governance for 
		Bangladesh. Strategically, we have to prioritize the sectors of the 
		government which is to be addressed first. For any good governance Local 
		government is the vital and crucial and in Bangladesh this is our 
		Upazilla administrative unit. So, e-Governance in Bangladesh should be 
		initiated at Upazilla level first. Perhaps, this bottom up approach 
		(i.e. starting from upazilla) strategy for e-governance is the most 
		appropriate in country like ours, where the majority of the population 
		live in villages under upazilla administrations.<br>
		<br>
		Financial constraints can be viewed as the major problem in this 
		context. But if the government is really sincere enough to use resources 
		in economic way then the funding for e-Governance will not be a big 
		issue. For instance, we can reduce the software procurement cost if we 
		use open source software or free software for developing various modules 
		for e-Governance. Besides, funding can also be possible from World Bank, 
		DFID, EU or other sources for initiating such project. Even the 
		government may approach to Microsoft in this context. It may be noted 
		that Bill Gate has already decided to dedicate his substantial amount of 
		his wealth to philanthropic works. He must be aware that ultimate 
		e-Governance will bring equity, social justice by reducing the digital 
		gap among different segments of the society. If the government can 
		persuade Bill Gate for implementing e-Governance in Bangladesh, 
		presumably he will come forward to assist a technologically backward 
		country like ours.<br>
		<br>
		Finally, it can be stated that we have resources in terms of manpower. 
		Among the new generation, many are getting technologically solvent. We 
		can use them in our e-Governance project. But preconditions for 
		initiating such a huge project, the government needs to be honest, 
		transparent, and stable with a clear vision for future. </font>
