		<span lang="EN-GB">On special days like our victory or independence 
		days, repeated lamentations on erosion of the spirits of independence 
		since the post Mujib era, in fact, is a cliché.&nbsp;&nbsp; To the new 
		generations, especially to many members of the post liberation 
		generation this simplistic notion has no special appeal at all. Rather, 
		to them the spirits of liberation signifies some nostalgic slogans of 
		some members of the older generation. This is, no doubt, due to the 
		utmost failure of our older generation bore the torch of some patriotic 
		ideologies with a view to guiding and rationalising the popular demand 
		for independence. &nbsp;Perhaps, they were so overwhelmed with their success 
		in the war of independence that they were little concerned for 
		transmitting those patriotic ideologies to the newer generations, who 
		eventually have sat at the steering position in different sects of the 
		society of the present Bangladesh. Understandably, due to this weakness 
		of the patriotic forces of the older generation, the reactionary and 
		defeated forces of 1971 could quite easily succeed to manipulate the 
		mindset of the younger generation by fabricating and twisting our 
		national history in a shrewd manner. The defeated forces knew that if 
		the new generations, who have not witnessed the war of independence 
		could be kept in the dark concerning our history of the liberation, one 
		day they would be in a state of success. This speculation of the evil 
		force has been deemed to be true to that extent that even in the 
		independent Bangladesh the infamous identified collaborators and war 
		criminals like Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mojaheed could elate 
		themselves to the position of ministers in independent Bangladesh. &nbsp;Not 
		only this, “there was no war criminal in 1971”, this recent comment of 
		sedition nature has been uttered by &nbsp;&nbsp;the notorious war criminal Al 
		Mojaheed and yet the government seems to be impotent in this regard! &nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">As a nation we must be ashamed of the fact that as 
		only after a few years of independence we have deviated from the very 
		objectives of our war of liberation, which could have been driven forces 
		for the overall development of the country. The valiant freedom fighters 
		in 1971 sacrificed their lives not only just for achieving a mere nation 
		state. Rather they dreamt of complete emancipation of the people of 
		their <i>Sonar Bangla</i> in dignified ways. The Bangladesh as we are 
		witnessing today is not keeping with the ambition of the freedom loving 
		people of that time. &nbsp;In fact their ambition reflected in the spirits of 
		independence which are depicted in the 1972 constitution as four firm 
		columns namely, nationalism, democracy, socialism and secularism. The 
		unfortunate distortion of these four columns has rotted the nation as a 
		whole and so we are facing a severe crisis in the socio-political 
		fabrics of the country.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">Abandoning the much hated ‘two nation theory’ in 
		1971, people of this land embraced the Bengali nationalism and 
		secularism as basic mantras for the salvation. Irony is that being a 
		valiant freedom fighter, Ziaur Rahman totally failed to foresee the 
		implication of the reinvention of the two nation theory in disguise of 
		‘Bangladeshi nationalism’ on the people of the country. It was the first 
		sidr hit on the spirit of the independence and destroyed the first 
		column of the constitution. </span></font>
		<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Again,
		</span><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-GB">it was Zia, who divided 
		the nation into pro-liberation and anti-liberation groups by legalising 
		communal politics in Bangladesh for his own political interest. So, 
		instead of secularism, as a nation, after a few years of our 
		independence we have stepped into the realm of communalism again in our 
		socio-political realm. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">Many have claimed that in the independent Bangladesh, 
		it was none but Bangabandhu had killed democracy and established 
		authoritarian rule by introducing BAKSAL in 1975. Apparently this seems 
		to be true. But this becomes half-true if we objectively analyse 
		rationale behind introducing BAKSAL on his part. In fact, it could be 
		argued that democracy loving Bangabandhu was bound to embrace 
		authoritarian rule in accordance with the demand of the time. The very 
		objective of BAKSAL was to establish socialism in the country, which was 
		one of the major spirits of our war of liberation. Besides BAKSAL was 
		formed in a democratic way through proper discussion in the parliament 
		and most of the people of the country at that time including leading 
		intellectuals, journalists and other professional group,&nbsp; as reported in 
		the newspapers of that time &nbsp;unanimously congratulated BAKSAL. However, 
		right now, no conclusive remark on BAKSAL is possible as it died at its 
		infantile stage with the brutal killing of the father of the nation.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">Socialism has been depicted as one of the vital 
		driven forces for our war of liberation. Because at that time for the 
		total economic emancipation, secularism was considered as the most 
		powerful ideology. Though, at the present global context the term 
		socialism has no appeal to many but in the context of our country this 
		symbolises the economic emancipation of the people. However, we have 
		also distorted this spirit of liberation by importing consumer driven 
		and black money oriented economy in our country. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">The post 1975 era failed to put the country on right 
		democratic footings. In fact, from 1975 to 1990 the country was running 
		under either direct or quasi military regimes. This is historically 
		proven that no military regime in the world works for promoting true 
		democracy. However, post 1990 could be golden era for practising true 
		democracy in the country. But due to rising impact of communalism and 
		terrorism, corruption ridden leadership and intolerance between two 
		major political parties, the country failed to avail that opportunity.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">The change in 1/11 has instigated rays of hope among 
		some people of the country. Especially vibrant utterances of the army 
		chief General M U Ahmed as well as the &nbsp;head of the interim government, 
		&nbsp;Dr. Fakhrudding Ahmed on the issues of liberation war and war 
		collaborators have prompted some to think that the country is now moving 
		towards the right direction. But yet, most of the people are really 
		confused. In fact what is the ultimate goal of this government is not 
		clear to the people. However, if we want to see a real progress of the 
		country, we have to start from the premise. Especially, it is a must to 
		instil into the mindset of the new generations the spirit of the 
		liberation. Then may be in near future, infusing the spirits of 
		liberation in the new generations, the fresh leadership will be created 
		to lead the country in a positive way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
