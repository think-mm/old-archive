	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:Verdana">During the closing decade of 
	the last century, perhaps on the first or second day of my graduate 
	programme in the university of Wales, UK at the end of the lecture, an young 
	girl student wearing short skirt and transparent T-shirt sat (to my eastern 
	eyes the dress was provocative indeed!) on the professor’s desk and started 
	to chat with the professor. To my utmost surprise the middle aged professor 
	did not find any wrong in it and without hesitation answered the queries of 
	the girl. As a stranger to western classroom environment, it was a sort of 
	cultural shock for me. In our culture we place our teachers in a respectable 
	place like our parents and so perhaps most of us would not approve of such 
	close interaction between teacher and student.&nbsp; On another instance, when I 
	addressed one of my professors as ‘sir’, the professor interrupted me and 
	advised, “Mr. Kabir, please don’t call me ‘sir’. I don’t like this colonial 
	word. My name is Moseley. You may call me Moseley.” &nbsp;Again in the 
	Sub-continental culture, addressing a teacher by name, no doubt, is 
	considered to be an offence. From these two instances, it is evident that 
	the post modern Western society has redefined teacher-student relationship 
	in different ways from that of ours. In fact, the contemporary western 
	society prefers to see both the teacher and students at the same level and 
	emphasises the friendship in teacher-student relationship. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Many of my 
	young colleagues are really confused to define the teacher-student 
	relationship. What should be the salient features of such relationship? In 
	this context, should we follow the western ethos or should we cling to our 
	tradition? &nbsp;In our society, traditionally teacher-student relationship is 
	viewed as parent-child relationship. The root of such perception originates 
	in our religious traditions, be it Hinduism, Buddhism or Islamic one. &nbsp;In 
	Hinduism <i>guru-shishya</i> (teacher-disciple) tradition is a spiritual 
	relationship which is centered around the </span>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">transmission</span><span style="font-family:Verdana"> 
	of knowledge from a <i>guru</i> to a <i>shishya</i>. The guru-shishya 
	relationship, in fact, is a practice which has evolved into a fundamental 
	component of Hinduism, since the beginning of the tradition of oral teaching 
	of the Upanishad (2000 BC), a major Hindu scripture. Knowledge, whether be 
	it spiritual or other secular forms of knowledge, such as, warfare, music, 
	art, is imparted through developing relationship between <i>guru</i> and <i>
	shishya</i>. &nbsp;The principle of this relationship is that knowledge, 
	especially subtle or advanced knowledge, is best conveyed through a strong 
	human relationship based on ideals of student’s respect, commitment, 
	devotion and obedience, and personal instruction by which the student 
	eventually masters the knowledge that guru embodies.&nbsp; Like Hinduism, in 
	Buddhism the <i>guru-shishya</i> relationship is sacred one and stresses on 
	a strong devotional aspect on the part of the student.
	<span style="color:#000033">Rob Preece, a contemporary sociologist has 
	observed that in the Buddhist tradition&nbsp; there is supposed to be a special 
	hell where those who criticize the teacher will go. If there were such a 
	hell he suggest it is the hell of guilt, fear and torment a disciple is 
	likely to suffer for his challenge to the authority of the teacher. </span>
	In Islamic tradition also teacher-student relationship is comparable to the 
	parent-child relationship. In this context<span style="color:black"> eminent 
	Islamic Jurisprudent Professor</span> <span style="color: black">Dr. Sano 
	Koutoub Moustapha</span><span style="color:black"> of International Islamic 
	University, Malaysia, has argued that, “The relationship between teacher and 
	student should be based on mutual love and respect. The teacher should treat 
	the students as his or her own children, and the students should consider 
	the teacher as their own parent.”</span><span style="color:
#000033">&nbsp; In essence, it is evident that the sub-continental religions has 
	provided teacher with full authority over the students. This, in turn, 
	produces power imbalance in teacher-student relationship placing the teacher 
	in more powerful position. The power imbalance that arises in 
	teacher-student relationship places the teacher in the more powerful 
	position.&nbsp; Based on above discussions, it can be argued that, in the 
	sub-continent religions have shaped the teacher-student relationship even in 
	the sphere of secular education. However, the older teacher-student 
	relationship was straightforward and was based on one to one relationship. 
	But the formal institutionalization of education and subsequent 
	commercialization of it has transformed this relationship into many to many 
	scenarios adding manifolds complexities.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#000033">Salient features of 
	parent-child relationship as we have been practising in the case of 
	teacher-student relationship work well as long as teachers are conscious 
	about their apex position in such relationship and refrain from abusing 
	powers that are vested upon them. As in general, the teacher is from the 
	senior generation from their student counterparts, it is the teacher’s 
	responsibility to establish the basis of relationship. Unfortunately, power 
	imbalance in student-teacher relationship of this part of the world sometime 
	alienates the students from the teachers. Empirical studies have revealed 
	that many people who have experienced problems in their relationship with 
	teachers; it is often because the teacher stays in the place of the 
	authority and gets it wrong. Some teachers, in reality, show extreme 
	authoritarian attitude towards their students without assessing the 
	implication of it on the students’ psychology. &nbsp;It is evident that many 
	students, out of fear, can not interact freely with their respective 
	teachers. Such distance often creates communication barrier between teacher 
	and student. This, in turn, hampers the academic life of the student as in 
	the learning environment, proper communication between teacher and student 
	is a must.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000033">To 
	facilitate the ‘best communication’ channel between teacher and student, the 
	West in the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century has redefined teacher-student 
	relationship. For this, they have emphasized on friendly relationship and<b>
	</b>abated<b> </b>the magnitude of authoritarian characteristic of the 
	teacher over the student.&nbsp; Though this friendly teacher-student relationship 
	has largely alleviated the fear in the psyche of the student centring 
	his/her teacher, which in turn has created pleasant communication channel 
	between teacher and student, an essential criteria for teaching and learning 
	environment.&nbsp;&nbsp; But too much friendliness in teacher-student relationship has 
	an adverse effect too as observed in many countries in Europe including the 
	UK.&nbsp; Teachers, especially at school/college level, have lost their 
	authoritarian power in controlling the students as the law prevents the 
	teacher to punish even an unruly student. Many of the young students 
	frequently take this advantage as their freedom and disobey their teachers. 
	This sort of behaviour is detrimental to congenial learning environment. So, 
	in the UK, especially in the public schools, as reported by many teachers, 
	due to this unruly behaviour of some students, frequently fail in 
	maintaining the class room discipline.&nbsp; For the same reason many meritorious 
	graduates in the UK do not take interest to accept the</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#000033"> 
	school teaching as their careers in public schools.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000033">Not only at 
	the school level, even at the tertiary level over friendly relationship 
	between teacher and student has the adverse impact as some empirical studies 
	suggest. At the university level some time friendly relationship between the 
	teacher and the student may turn into intimate relationship. According to 
	the guidelines policy for teacher-student relationship of Windsor University
	</span><span style="font-family:Verdana;
color:black">the intimate personal relationships are defined as “including but 
	not limited to a sexual relationship, the formation of a deep emotional 
	bond, physical contact inappropriate to a teacher-student relationship and 
	communication whether in person or not inappropriate to a teacher-student 
	relationship”.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000033">
	<span lang="EN-GB">In this context, Bruce Tucker, Windsor’s associate 
	vice-president has commented that, ‘an intimate relationship between a
	</span></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black">professor and a 
	student is exploitive in the sense that there is a power differential 
	between the two and the student can be victimized, and that is 
	inappropriate.&quot; This is not an exclusive problem of Windsor University. 
	Rather facing the similar sort of problems, many other universities in the 
	developed world have formulated policy for streamlining professor-student 
	relationship. </span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000033">Then what 
	should be an ideal teacher-student relationship? In fact, there is no 
	universal prescription for defining a standard for teacher-student 
	relationship. Any relationship between two persons depends on socio-cultural 
	context, age groups, as well as the taste of individuals involved in that 
	relationship. Despite this reality, still we can draw a baseline principle 
	for effective teacher-student relationship of our own considering our 
	socio-cultural ethos, students/teachers’ psychology, and modern scientific 
	teaching methodology. We should remember that the expectation from a teacher 
	in our society is quite high and so the society has given the teacher 
	authoritarian power over the student. A teacher is always a teacher and the 
	expectation of the society is that a teacher should be a role model to the 
	eye of the student.&nbsp; Keeping this in mind, teachers should set up the 
	effective and efficient relationships with their respective students. 
	However, in this effort teachers should not misuse the authoritarian power 
	&nbsp;vested upon them by virtue of their social status. Rather, teachers should 
	earn certain attributes so that students voluntarily obey the instructions 
	of the teachers with much respect. Some of these attributes like sound 
	knowledge in subject area to teach, honesty, sincerity, integrity, principle 
	to keep the commitment can be cited. Through perseverance, practice and 
	strong determination a teacher can acquire these qualities over the span of 
	time.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: #000033">In the 
	corporate world, give and take is the prime motivating factor in setting up 
	relationship with the client and so the win-win situation plays as a major 
	role there.&nbsp; But the teacher-student relationship should be based on 
	dedication, at least from the teacher’s side. So, in dealing with the 
	student, a teacher should not assess what he/she is going to receive from 
	the student in return, especially in financial term. </span></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #000033">
	It has been already emphasized that for effective and efficient learning 
	environment congenial communication channels should persist in 
	teacher-student relationship. By misappropriating the authoritarian power 
	over the student given by our society, the teacher must not instil any sort 
	of panic into the mindset of the student so that he/she becomes afraid of 
	interacting with his/her respective teachers. &nbsp;So, it is imperative that the 
	teachers should be friendly with their students.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But considering our 
	socio-cultural aspects, teachers need to draw a boundary and they should not 
	be over friendly with their students. Teachers should guide this 
	relationship with a self imposed restriction. On part of a teacher, this is 
	quite possible.&nbsp; After all, the teacher is the major actor in 
	teacher-student relationship!! &nbsp;</span></p>
