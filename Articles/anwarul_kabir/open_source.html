		<b><span lang="EN-GB">Prelude:</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp; Based on 
		the Marxist economic theory of surplus value incorporated with the 
		Darwin’s theory of evolution in social sphere, socialism, the pro-poor 
		doctrine has been introduced in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. Later 
		the early 20<sup>th</sup> century has witnessed the empirically 
		established model for socialist country Union of Soviet Socialist Russia 
		(USSR) in 1917. Since then people from underdeveloped country on the 
		globe have been inclining towards socialistic ideology in different 
		forms for the economic emancipation and many countries following the 
		Soviet Union have adopted the socialist structure of the government 
		aligning with the aspirations of the poor people. However, the fall of 
		socialist structure of governments in the Soviet Union and other 
		countries in the Soviet sphere, in 1990 and onward has instilled to the 
		psyche of some social scientists a negative notion towards socialism and 
		socialist structure of the government. But still it can be argued that 
		socialist structure of government is a proven and perhaps the best one 
		for the economic salvation of the poor. Besides, the empirical evidences 
		have strongly suggested that the socialism with all its limitations is 
		the best ideology to ensure the basic rights of the people as well as 
		minimise the gap between the poor and the rich in a society. &nbsp;So, till 
		to date, for the poor people of the third world countries, the appeal 
		for socialism has not been diminished.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">The technological development has the sharp impact on 
		formation of social order, social relationships and sociological 
		discourse. The invention of microprocessors in 1980s and subsequent 
		birth of PC have facilitated the wide use of computers over the globe. 
		Parallel invention of TCP/IP protocol for the Internet has added a new 
		dimension to the arena of computer communications by compressing time 
		and geographical distances which in turn has coined the buzz word 
		globalisation in sociological discourse. Though this post modern 
		technology, namely Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has 
		been transforming the world into a knowledge-based society since its 
		inception, still it has side effect too. Due to disparity in use of ICT, 
		the world is now distinctly digitally divided. Though the UN has 
		recognised, the access to information is one of the basic rights, the 
		majority of the people in the third world countries are deprived of this 
		right even in this information era. The causes of this are manifold. 
		&nbsp;However, two major causes that have been identified, so far, are the 
		high price of ICT technology and the linguistic barrier. Regarding the 
		price of the ICT technology, it may be mentioned here that the prices of 
		hardware since the introduction of microprocessors have been going 
		downward but conversely the prices of software are spiralling abruptly. 
		This, in turn, has revealed that the resulting prices of the ICT 
		technology are towards upward thrust. However, if we survey the third 
		world countries like Bangladesh then it may reveal surprisingly that 
		despite the price hike of software in the global market, the number of 
		computer users has been increasing at exponential rate since last 
		decade. This is, in fact, possible due to the availability of pirated 
		software in the local market. Still, in our country the use of computers 
		are limited to some segments of the society and it may be claimed that 
		the percentage of the computer users has not exceeded 4% of the people, 
		considering the English enabled population of the country (only 4% 
		people can read and write English!)</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">Apparently the availability and the use of the 
		pirated software due to lack of enforcement of software copy right act 
		seems to be a blessing for the third world countries though morally this 
		trend is not acceptable. However, this trend will not persist in near 
		future. Already the leading proprietorship software company Microsoft 
		has opened its branch office in Dhaka. It is understandable that 
		following the foot step of Microsoft, other such companies will come 
		forward to find new business opportunities. Eventually with the increase 
		of computer users these entrepreneurs will exert pressure on the 
		government to enforce proper copy right act for software as a vanguard 
		for their business interest. &nbsp;Facing this reality the Government of 
		China has cleverly decided to replace the Closed Source Software with 
		the Open Source Software (OSS) paradigm at least at the government 
		level. Malaysia has also opted for OSS envisioning the future debacle if 
		it sticks to the Closed Source Software development paradigm. Not only 
		the developing countries, even the developed countries, for instance, 
		France has also emphasised on OSS with a view to cutting down its budget 
		for ICT development. Perhaps understanding thee new technological 
		doctrine, UNDP has also started to promote the OSS by initiating some 
		global projects. &nbsp;In essence, it may be argued that the OSS has paved 
		the way to cut down the ICT cost abruptly and this pro poor 
		technological discourse has the capacity to eradicate the curse of 
		digital gap from the societies worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

		<font face="Verdana"><b><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;A Glimpse of Open Source 
		Software Development Paradigm:</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> According 
		to an Internet definition, software are written coded commands that tell 
		a computer what tasks to perform. For example, Word, PhotoShop, MS 
		Windows and Oracle are software programs. Software may come with either 
		in human understandable written codes (or source codes) or machine 
		understandable binary formats (or executable files). The traditional 
		closed source software (or proprietary software) does not include human 
		understandable source code, rather it includes the binary formatted 
		codes. So, any modification or enhancement in this type of software is 
		not possible without assistance from the manufacturers who keep the 
		source coded with them. The primary motivation of such non-delivery of 
		&nbsp;&nbsp;source code is commercial one. Such software has the strict licence 
		agreement at the time of purchasing which restricts the users in 
		copying, modifying or redistributing of the product. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12.0pt">
		<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-GB">The sojourn of Open Source 
		Software has started in 1991 and onward with development of Linux 
		operating system which includes source code and provides free license 
		for copying, modifying and redistributing. Inspired with the success 
		story of Linux, OSS</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: #303030">
		</span><span lang="EN" style="color: #303030">facilitates the end users 
		&nbsp;with a license that gives the end user the right to use OSS &nbsp;for 
		private or commercial use. OSS comprises of features such as the users' 
		right to a) inspect and modify the underlying source code, b) sell or 
		distribute original or modified version of OSS, c) distribute the 
		modified source code for others' benefit. So essentially by definition 
		the OSS has a motto for social welfare which may be compared with 
		socialism as discussed in the prelude. Moreover, one of the OSS 
		development methodologies emphasizes on sharing of software development 
		work like the community work. So OSS can also be defined as </span>
		<span style="color: #1E3614">software that is developed collaboratively 
		by developers across the globe. The software itself is available at 
		little or no cost. The source code is distributed with the executable 
		form, giving users of the software the freedom to modify, adapt and 
		improve the software to meet their needs. </span>
		<span lang="EN" style="color: #303030">&nbsp;This sharing strategy can also 
		be compared with the left oriented socialist ideology. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">OSS is 
		helping people around the globe escape the crime of software &quot;piracy&quot;.
		</span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Verdana">GNU/Linux, and 
		numbers of useful software that come along with it, is clearly 
		attracting interest from a range of quarters. <span style="color: black">
		In large parts of the world where the average per capita income is often 
		less than the cost of a computer, the current phenomenal price of 
		software turns millions into &quot;pirates&quot;. This sort of piracy can be 
		easily avoided by adopting the OSS. In the arena of OSS, words such as 
		free or low cost are not necessarily associated with low-quality, rather 
		the availability of&nbsp; many high quality OSS discards this negative 
		notion. For instance, open source operating system Linux is far better 
		than proprietary MS Windows operating systems in terms of quality, 
		security and flexibility. &nbsp;OSS for database languages like </span>
		</span><span style="font-family: Verdana">MySQL, PostgresSQL have been 
		proved to be as efficient as other leading proprietary database 
		programming languages.&nbsp; On the Internet the wide use of apache, SendMail 
		expressed the success story of OSS.</span></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Since 
		the inception of of OSS paradigm, it has been playing a significant role 
		to eradicate the linguistic barrier of computer use by incorporating 
		with it the concept of localization. <span style="color: black">Enabling
		<span class="caps">ICT</span>s in the local language of the user is 
		known as localization. The activists of OSS are voluntarily carrying out 
		many</span> projects on localization worldwide with a view to minimizing 
		the digital divide worldwide. </span></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
		Software entrepreneurs may perceive the OSS paradigm as a barrier to 
		their business opportunity as the very term OSS is intermingled with 
		‘free of cost.’ But in reality the OSS is not always free and 
		commercially it has been found more viable than its closed source 
		counter part. In fact, use of OSS neither minimizes the profit margin 
		nor lessens the wages of programmers. Rather the use of open source 
		developing tools reduces abruptly the production cost of application 
		software which in turn, attracts more customers and provides the 
		entrepreneurs with more business opportunity. For instance, the 
		production cost of developing any application software using MySQL on 
		the Linux platform is much lower than that of using Oracle on the 
		Windows platform as the latter’s case while assessing the price of the 
		end product includes the price for the operating system and the 
		developing tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p style="text-align: justify"><b><span style="font-family: Verdana">OSS 
		and future ICT Development in Bangladesh: </span></b>
		<span style="font-family: Verdana">“Bangladesh should prefer Linux 
		operating system to Microsoft in order to leapfrog in the ICT sector. 
		Bangladesh government's ICT policy should also make Linux the national 
		standard of computer operating system” this quote of Dr. Mahathir
