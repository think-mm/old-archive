		<span lang="EN-GB">The article entitled “Constitutionality of the 
		caretaker government” (published in the Daily Star of &nbsp;September 11), 
		authored by Barrister Harun ur Rashid has prompted me to write the 
		present article. Unfortunately, the observation of the reverend author 
		regarding the incumbent government is clearly misleading based on 
		misinterpreted constitutional provisions. The essence of his article 
		that the present government has been working within constitutional 
		provisions in all respect is, in fact, contrary to the reality; if we 
		objectively probe into the constitution then it can be asserted that 
		since the inception of the Caretaker Government headed by Prof. Iajuddin 
		Ahmed until the tenure of the government headed by Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, 
		some of the constitutional provisions have been grossly violated. In 
		fact, such violations have put the country in a state of jargon with 
		ambiguous constitutional footings. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">Perhaps due to this ambiguity, even the people at the 
		power centre are contradicting each other in defining the nature of the 
		government. After the August student agitation, in a meeting with the 
		news editors of the electronic media, our Barrister Advisor Mainul 
		Hossain, who is also in charge of law ministry has termed the incumbent 
		government as a national government. Subsequently, in the following day, 
		the sitting army chief General M U Ahmed has discarded this notion and 
		confirmed that this government is neither a national government nor an 
		army backed interim government. Then what will be the nature of the 
		government? To get the concrete answer to these questions one need not 
		to be an expert of constitution. Rather a simple analysis in light of 
		constitution will lead to a logical conclusion in this regard. The 
		following sections have tried to capture some popular notions 
		surrounding the government with a view to revealing the 
		constitutionality of the government.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">

		<b><i>

		Present government is a national government:&nbsp; </span></i></b>
		<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The 
		present government, by no means, fits with the very definition of the 
		national government. The national government is, in fact, a united 
		government which should be constituted with the representatives from all 
		the major political parties of the country.&nbsp; But the advisors of the 
		present government including its head Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed are 
		non-political in accordance with the provision of the non-partisan 
		caretaker government of the constitution. Moreover, our constitution has 
		no provision for forming a national government. Perhaps, understanding 
		this reality the army chief has rightly discarded the notion of national 
		government that perceived by Barrister Mainul Hossain</span><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">b)</span></i></b><i><span lang="EN-GB">
		<b>The present government is an Army Backed Interim Government:</b></span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> 
		This strongly rooted perception among the mindset of the people has some 
		ground realities. If we shed light on the way of installation of this 
		government, we cannot fully negate this notion. This is now an open 
		secret that the caretaker government headed by Prof. Iajuddin Ahmed 
		resigned under the tremendous pressure of army administration on January 
		11. Besides, the selection of Dr. Fakhruddin &nbsp;Ahmed as the Chief Advisor 
		of the &nbsp;government, presumably was carried out by the same 
		administration. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">Prevalent dominance of army in different civil 
		administration is one of the reasons which coined the terminology ‘the 
		army backed interim government’. Besides, the mass media has also 
		popularised this terminology in defining this government.&nbsp; But in our 
		constitution there is no clause for such army backed government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<span lang="EN-GB">country at present is under military or 
		quasi-military regime. Again the growth of such perception among the 
		mindset of these individuals is, in fact, due to dominance of army 
		administration over the civil administration. Parallel to Anti 
		Corruption Commission, formation of the National Task Force under army 
		administration has supported this assertion. Some activities of this 
		Task Force, for instance arresting the political leaders and sending 
		them to the Task Force Intelligent Cell for interrogation, and the way 
		of eliciting ‘confessional statements’ have reminded the shadow of 
		martial law regimes.&nbsp; During the tenure of this government, in the new 
		context, some administrative changes have placed the army officials at 
		the top level of different government agencies (e.g. RAJUK, Bangladesh 
		Cricket Control Board). This is a common practice of any military or 
		quasi-military regime. In this context, another point is to be 
		mentioned.&nbsp; Under the civil government, it is a common practice for the 
		defence leadership to stay in a low profile and military high-ups 
		usually refrain themselves from participating in any discussions on 
		political issues. Contrary to this custom, the involvement of the 
		present army chief in political discourse as well as his interactions 
		with the general public and mass media have also confused the people in 
		defining the nature of this government.</span></font></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">However, a close investigation in light of 
		constitution reveals that the country is not under martial law as the 
		precondition of martial is to suspend the constitution with a formal 
		promulgation by introducing various martial law ordinances. But the 
		installation of the present government on the 12<sup>th</sup> January 
		has been formally carried out by the elected president&nbsp; following the 
		constitutional provision of the Non-Party Caretaker Government (Chapter 
		II A of the constitution). So, definitely this government is not running 
		under martial law although there are some clear deviations of 
		constitution have been noted (discussed in the next section).</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">The question of quasi military government is a matter 
		of perception. Even the democratically elected tenures of&nbsp; Zia and 
		Ershad, to many political analysts, have been marked as quasi military 
		regimes as at those period the dominance of army administration over the 
		civil administration were prevalent. So, whether this government is a 
		quasi-military government or not can be a discourse of perception. But 
		there is no legal framework for quasi military government in our 
		constitution.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<b><i><span lang="EN-GB">d) The present government is a constitutionally 
		defined Non-party caretaker government:</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">
		</span></b><span lang="EN-GB">We have already discussed on several 
		issues relevant to some popular notions towards the present government 
		and have revealed that these notions have no constitutional validity. 
		However,&nbsp; &nbsp;the fact is that on the 12<sup>th</sup> January this 
		government has been installed under the constitutional provision of 
		Non-party caretaker government (Chapter IIA of the constitution) and the 
		president has appointed the Chief Advisor and other advisors following 
		the article 58C(1). So, at least this government has the constitutional 
		coverage as Non-Party caretaker government.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: -.25in">
		<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-GB">But whether the way of appointment of the government 
		and afterwards whether the government has been following the 
		constitutional provisions are the matter of legal debates. Even in some 
		cases clear cut violation of constitution have been noted. The following 
		sections focus on these issues:</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: .25in">
		<font face="Verdana"><b><i><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></i></b></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<b><i><span lang="EN-GB">i. There is no consecutive caretaker 
		government:</span></i></b><span lang="EN-GB"> &nbsp;The observation of 
		Advocate Sultana Kamal, the former adviser of the caretaker government, 
		is</span><span style="color: black"> ‘If we follow the constitution, we 
		will see the present government is not above question. There is no 
		option in the constitution to have two caretaker governments in a row.' 
		&nbsp;If we analyze the constitution then, we can not discard her notion. 
		However, without mentioning any name, Barrister Harun has cited the 
		arguments of ‘many legal experts’ against this notion and the essence of 
		the arguments is, “there is no bar in the constitution for the president 
		to appoint a second CTG, in the event that the first one is found to be 
		incapable of holding an election in a free, fair and credible manner.” 
		This is, indeed, a lame excuse. For instance, we can not form a national 
		government right now following the argument that there is no bar in the 
		constitution against a national government. For this either an amendment 
		of constitution or a referendum is a must. So we can not deny the fact 
		that by forming second caretaker government, the constitutional 
		provision has been violated. </span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span style="color: black">Another point can be mentioned here that had 
		the president seek the opinion of the Supreme Court following the 
		Article 106 of the constitution (Which provides the Supreme Court with 
		advisory jurisdiction), the government would have not fallen into such a 
		constitutional debate. However, right now this deviation of constitution 
		can only be endorsed by emphasizing the doctrine of necessity. But any 
		doctrine of necessity must be ratified in the parliament whenever 
		possible. So, after the election, in the forthcoming parliament the 
		initiation of this government violating the constitutional provision 
		must be ratified.</span></font></p>

		judges to the post of the Chief Advisor), &nbsp;the president shall consult 
		the major political parties as far as practicable. But in appointing Dr. 
		Fakruddin as Chief Advisor such consultation with the major political 
		parties was not held. This can also be treated as a clear violation of 
		the constitution. However, in this regard, Barrister Harun has argued 
		that as the president declared emergency on January 11 and so it was not 
		possible on his part to consult the political parties. But in this 
		context it can be argued that to pave the way for arranging such 
		consultation as suggested by the constitution, the president could relax 
		some provisions of emergency rules as the president has all the

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span style="color: black">The above article has explicitly mandated to 
		hold the election within 90 days after the expiry of the parliament. 
		However, the failure of the first caretaker government headed by Prof. 
		Iajuddin Ahmed has created the problem in this context. But after 
		assumption of&nbsp; subsequent caretaker government headed by Dr. Fakhruddin 
		Ahmed it had been expected that the election would be held within 180 
		days as some additional time might require for preparing a flawless 
		voters-list. This speculation was originated in Article 123(4) in the 
		context of arranging any&nbsp; by-poll due to vacancy of any member of 
		parliament for any reason. This article states, “ <i>…. Provided that in

		Commissioner should have some opinion in </span>
		<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black">favour</span><span style="color: black"> 
		of extension of the assigned time period. But in reality the Chief

		<span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span style="color: black">In support of this violation of constitution, 
		Barrister Harun has argued that Article 58D(2) has suggested, as the 
		holding of a peaceful, free and fair election is the prime concern of 
		the caretaker government, time limit should not be any bar (i.e. 
		whatever the time required to hold such an election is not a matter at 
		all!). This notion is indeed contrary to the spirit of the constitution. 
		&nbsp;As par Article 7(1) our constitution has emphasized the peoples’ power 
		and the exercise of peoples’ power is only possible if the government is 
		an elected one. So, the tenure of an unelected government more than a 
		year or more can not be endorsed by our constitution for any reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

		<b><i><span style="color: black">&nbsp;iv. The caretaker government is

		<i>“The Non-Party caretaker government shall discharge its functions as 
		an interim government and shall carry on the routine functions of such 
		government with the aid and assistance of persons in the services of the 
		Republic; and, except in the case of necessity for the discharge of such 
		functions it shall not make any policy decision.” </i>&nbsp;Contrary to this 
		binding of the constitution, in reality, the functions of this 
		government have not been limited to routine works only--- rather some 
		functions discharged by this government have treated as policy decision. 
		For instance, its decision to shut down the government jute mills, 
		reformation of Biman, the state owned airline can be cited in this 
		context.&nbsp; This is also a serious violation of the constitution.</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<b><i><span style="color: black">v. The tenure of a caretaker government 
		should not be elongated:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i></b><span style="color: black">Article 
		58D(1) has termed the Non-Partisan caretaker government as an interim 
		government. An interim government, in fact, is a transient and 
		short-lived government and the tenure of such a government ideally 
		should not exceed more than six months. But according to the roadmap for 
		election, the general election will be held perhaps sometime in 
		December. This implies that the life span of this government will be 
		more or less than two years. Clearly this has distorted the concept of 
		the interim government as well as the spirit of the constitution.&nbsp;
		</span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span style="color: black">However, in support of the prolonged tenure 
		of this government Barrister Harun has cited the Article 58B(1) of the 
		constitution. This article states that the tenure of the caretaker 
		government expires only when a new parliament is elected and&nbsp; a new 
		prime minister takes his/her office. However, this assertion derived 
		from the article 58B(1) can be considered as constitutional fallacy or 
		at best as constitutional loophole. In fact, the interpretation of this 
		article needs to consider some other factors. The prerequisite of this 
		article is that the election should be conducted within 90 days as par 
		article 123(3). Moreover, we have to consider the spirit of the 
		constitution. So, after the election, the elected prime minister should 
		assume the office as soon as possible (although the constitution has not 
		given any time limit in this case). This is because the spirit of the

		Perhaps, assessing the above stated violations of the constitution, many 
		conscious citizens of the country are really confused about the 
		constitutionality of the present government. &nbsp;In this context the 
		veteran politician and the author of our constitution &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Kamal 
		Husein has reminded us that we should not ask this delicate question on 
		the constitutionality of this government because many a time the 
		constitution was maimed and disfigured by the military since 1975. From 
		this statement, it is implicitly evident that to the eyes of Dr. Kamal 
		constitutionally this government is not flawless. Even despite Barrister 
		Harun’s assertion that the present government has been working in 
		constitutional provisions, he has not negated the necessity of 
		ratification of some activities of this government in the next 
		parliament as envisaged by Sheikh Hasina, the detained apex leader of 
		AL. This indeed reflects the confused state of his mind in assessing the 
		constitutionality of the present government.</span></p>
