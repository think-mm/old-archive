	<div class="doc-layout-body">
		<font size="2"></font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There seems to be a somewhat 
		general opinion in my part of the world that what we call freedom, 
		democracy, the freedom of speech etcetera, are values only prevalent, in 
		e.g. Sweden (let alone Denmark!). Maybe we should take this into 
		consideration once more. It is a fact, whether we like it or not, that 
		freedom of opinion as well as freedom of speech also exist in countries 
		with a Muslim profile. I have been brought up with a sentence that is 
		supposed to originate from The French (pre-)Revolution: I may hate all 
		that you say, but I will fight to death for your right to 
		say/express/print/publish it. As an individualistic individual I support 
		this, at the same time that I am fully aware of the fact that I am also 
		a historical, social, and cultural individual. Hence I definitely know 
		that I am a product of the processes of the new form of power in terms 
		of “modernity”, capitalism, democracy, liberalism, urbanisation, 
		individualisation, and etcetera. It is as simple as this: The concept of 
		freedom obviously – and always - must be understood in the context of 
		history, sociality, as well as culture. Hence we do not talk about 
		freedom to, but rather freedom from. Freedom from the bonds of feudalism 
		and collectivism via the bourgeois revolutions into the (new kind of 
		loss of freedom) in terms of industrialised/individualistic societies. 
		From feudalism to capitalism. From one set of powers to another set of 
		powers. And this is what we say in the Swedish Constitution: “The 
		freedom of the press is understood to mean the right of every Swedish 
		citizen to publish written matter, without prior hindrance by a public 
		authority or other public body, and not to be prosecuted thereafter on 
		grounds of its content other than before a lawful court, or punished 
		therefore other than because the content contravenes an express 
		provision of law, enacted to preserve public order without suppressing 
		information to the public. /My italics, AJ/ In accordance with the 
		principles set out in paragraph one concerning freedom of the press for 
		all, and to secure the free exchange of opinion and availability of 
		comprehensive information, every Swedish citizen shall be free, subject 
		to the rules contained in this Act for the protection of private rights 
		and public safety, to express his thoughts and opinions in print, to 
		publish official documents and to communicate information and 
		intelligence on any subject whatsoever.” OK? Well, this could actually 
		be looked upon – together with our quaint royalties – as some kind of 
		reminder, or resting products if you like, of feudalism now codified 
		into the power structures of liberalism as well as social-liberalism. 
		Print, by all means, whatever you like, and then produce it and publish 
		it. If you i) have access to mass-media through your big wallet, ii) 
		have access to the net (it is a vulnerable fact that the overwhelming 
		population of the world still haven’t made their first telephone call!, 
		iii) have access to the liberal media and/or are a power-holder! Freedom 
		and opinion of speech? Sure! Think whatever you like, but to print your 
		thoughts – be bloody rich! </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And another thing: “…than 
		because the content contravenes an express provision of law, enacted to 
		preserve public order without suppressing information to the public…” 
		But, dear friends, isn’t that exactly what has been going on in my part 
		of the world? Isn’t that exactly the limitations of the limitations? 
		Isn’t that exactly the limitations that e.g. Israel just now is 
		implementing? Isn’t that exactly what we have decided – here in terms of 
		the power-holders in terms of a national perspective, here in terms of 
		an international perspective, here in terms of a universalistic – global 
		perspective? So, Dear Al Jazeera or IPS: By all means have any opinion 
		you like, but, for heaven’s sake don’t ever believe that “we” will print 
		it! Well, after having participated for many years in the global 
		discussion about the exploiting as well as the impoverished parts of the 
		world I find the discussion just now as somewhat naïve and 
		imperialistic. It is a historical fact that global archeology, 
		ethnology, social-anthropology, cultural geography, sociology and so on 
		and so forth, have stated as an ipso facto that human kind as a race has 
		been very much global for thousands of years. And, furthermore: The so 
		called Mohammad cartoons are – of course – not images of our Prophet. 
		Instead they are intentional and deliberate products. Grossly 
		generalizing images of the Great Danger, the ultimate enemy, the 
		swarthy, hook-nosed, eye-brows-identified, bearded, scimitar-armed and 
		bombed/bombing killer. That very man (or nowadays also woman?) who after 
		the fall of The Soviet Empire more than anything else has been the very 
		symbol of evil. The danger of Islam per se seems to be recently invented 
		although its long historical background. And Mohammad? Well, my Bengali 
		wife is a secularized muslim, a socialist and a feminist, and she has 
		been fighting all her life against patriarchal structures and oppression 
		– and she reacted with some kind of intractable fury and rage about the 
		anti-globalization, orientalism and racism of her new social context. 
		And suddenly all that which seemed so unbelievable became believable. 
		Or…? </font></p>
