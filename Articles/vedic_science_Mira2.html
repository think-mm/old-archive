    <p align="justify">IN the first part of this essay I examined how Hindutva
    ideologues constructed the myth of &quot;Vedas as books of science&quot; (<i>Frontline</i>,
    January 2). I argued that the anti-science rhetoric of postmodern
    intellectuals has given philosophical respectability to the eclectic
    patchwork of science and Hindu metaphysics that goes under the name of Vedic
    science. In this part, I will examine the philosophical arguments for
    &quot;alternative sciences&quot; favoured by prominent feminists,
    environmentalists and postcolonial intellectuals and show how they converge
    with the right-wing's claims of superiority of &quot;holistic&quot; and
    &quot;authentic&quot; sciences of Hindus. I want to start by placing these
    debates in the historical context of Hindu &quot;renaissance&quot;.
    <p align="justify"><font class="subsectionhead" color="red" size="3">Postcolonialism
    and the myth of Hindu &quot;renaissance&quot;</font>
    <p align="justify">The roots of &quot;Vedic science&quot; can be traced to
    the so-called Bengal Renaissance, which in turn was deeply influenced by the
    Orientalist constructions of Vedic antiquity as the &quot;Golden Age&quot;
    of Hinduism. Heavily influenced by German idealism and British romanticism,
    important Orientalists including H.T. Colebrooke, Max Mueller and Paul
    Deussen tended to locate the central core of Hindu thought in the Vedas, the
    Upanishads and, above all, in the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Shankara.
    Despite the deeply anti-rational and idealistic (that is, anti-naturalistic)
    elements of Advaita Vedanta, key Hindu nationalist reformers - from Raja Ram
    Mohun Roy and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee to Swami Vivekananda - began to find
    in it all the elements of modernity. Vivekananda took the lead in
    propagating the view that the monism of Advaita Vedanta presaged the future
    culmination of all of modern science. Since modern science denied the role
    of any supernatural force outside nature, Vivekananda claimed that only
    Vedantic monism was truly scientific for it treated God as an aspect of
    nature and did not invoke any force external to nature.

    <p>&nbsp;
    <p align="justify">A slight digression on the subject of Indian
    &quot;renaissance&quot; might be appropriate here. Through constant and loud
    repetition, neo-Hindu thinkers have created a myth that Brahminical
    traditions of learning represent the golden age of science and reason in
    early India. The Hindutva literature is replete with glowing tributes to
    Hindu &quot;renaissance&quot;, which they claim to be similar to the
    European Renaissance that ushered in the modern age in the West. What they
    forget is that the Renaissance in the West re-discovered the humanistic and
    naturalistic sources of the Greek tradition that had been overshadowed by
    the Catholic Church - the Renaissance humanists rediscovered this-worldly
    philosophy of Aristotle and critical-realist Socrates over the other-worldly
    philosophy of Plato. The neo-Hindu &quot;renaissance&quot;, in contrast,
    re-discovered the most mystical and anti-humanistic elements of the Vedic
    inheritance - Advaita Vedanta - that had always overshadowed and silenced
    the naturalistic and scientific traditions in Hinduism and Buddhism.
    Neo-Hinduism is no renaissance, but a revival.
    <p align="justify">There is no denying that the neo-Hindu
    &quot;discovery&quot; of modern science in ancient teachings of Vedas and
    Upanishads had a limited usefulness. Since they had convinced themselves
    that their religion was the mother of all sciences, conservative Hindus did
    not feel threatened by scientific education. As long as science could be
    treated as &quot;just another name&quot; for Vedic truths, they were even
    enthusiastic to learn it. The Brahminical traditions of learning and
    speculative thought served the upper castes well, as they took to modern
    English education, which included instruction in scientific subjects. Those
    who would explicitly use scientific learning to challenge the traditional
    outlook were either lower down on the caste hierarchy or &quot;godless
    Communists&quot; anyway, and could be safely ignored. The great neo-Hindu
    &quot;renaissance&quot; succeeded in turning empirical sciences into the
    handmaiden of the Vedic tradition - the role reason has performed throughout
    India's history. This is the tradition that the Sangh Parivar is
    institutionalising in our schools, universities and the public sphere.
    <p align="justify">Let us see what India's best-known contemporary public
    intellectuals have to say on this matter. As it happens, the emergence of
    neo-Hinduism in 19th century Bengal has perhaps been the most written about
    episode in modern India's intellectual history. All our best-known
    intellectuals whose names are practically synonymous with postcolonial
    theory around the world - Ashis Nandy, Partha Chatterjee, Gayatri Spivak,
    Dipesh Chakrabarty and the Subaltern Studies historians - have cut their
    scholarly teeth on the emergence of neo-Hindu thought in the Bengali <i>bhadralok</i>
    circles. These intellectuals stand out because they work with a post-structuralist
    rejection of the very possibility of the idea of dispassionate and objective
    knowledge of the real world in any domain, natural or social. Following the
    political writing of French philosopher Michel Foucault, made popular among
    the historians of colonialism by the writings of Edward Said, these scholars
    see Western sciences as serving colonial interests in defining the non-West
    as inferior, irrational and unscientific. Indian intellectuals have both
    contributed to the development of this critique of colonial knowledge and
    applied it to the Indian condition.

    <b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b></center>
    <p>&nbsp;
    <p align="justify">By and large, these postcolonial scholars have criticised
    the neo-Hindu penchant for scienticising the Vedas, but for reasons that
    actually open the door to an even more radical defence of Vedic science that
    is now emerging in Hindutva literature. Ashis Nandy and Partha Chatterjee,
    both writers of international best-sellers on the emergence of modern
    thought in India, condemned the emerging Hindu modernists all across the
    political spectrum - from the apologists for Hinduism such as Vivekananda,
    Aurobindo and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee to the liberal, secular-humanist
    Nehru - not for so falsely and so self-servingly appropriating modern
    science in the service of propagating religious orthodoxy and not for
    confusing myth and science in order to defend their mythology. No, that kind
    of critique of nativism that would defend the distinctiveness of science and
    insist upon its potential for demystification of religious reason was
    considered too passé, too &quot;positivist&quot; by our avant-garde
    theorists. Rather, Nandy, Chatterjee and their followers condemned Indian
    nationalists for even daring to apply alien, colonial categories of thought
    to India's own traditions and ways of knowing.
    <p align="justify">For these postmarked intellectuals, the cardinal sin of
    Hindu nationalists was not their defence of the high-Hindu tradition - a
    tradition which has for centuries contributed to the worst kind of ignorance
    and social inequality. Their cardinal sin was their capitulation to modern
    scientific thought itself, which they tried to appropriate for Hinduism (as
    in the case of Vivekananda, Bankim Chandra and even Nehru), or which they
    tried to use for secular Enlightenment (as in the case of Marxist and
    socialist humanists like Nehru). Incidentally, these two positions seem to
    exhaust the entire range of nationalism. The valiant attempts of Dalit and
    non-Brahmin intellectuals such as B.R. Ambedkar, E.V. Ramaswamy Periyar,
    Jyotiba Phule and Iyothee Thass to use the new knowledge to liberate
    themselves from the shackles of tradition are simply invisible in the
    postmodernist literature which is keen on showing modern science as an agent
    of oppression and mental colonialism. As long as Indian thought was being
    measured in modern scientific terms, whether to praise it, or to demystify
    it, the Indian mind was being &quot;colonised&quot; and it was denied the
    &quot;agency&quot; to define its own agenda and its own solutions. Both the
    Hindu right and the Nehruvian left, as long as they remained prisoners of
    modern scientific ways of thinking, were equally &quot;derivatives&quot; of
    their colonial masters.
    <p align="justify">Authentic national liberation, on this account, can only
    come with the rediscovery of authentic traditions of India which,
    apparently, were only understood by Mahatma Gandhi. For all their nods to
    the anti-essentialism of postmodernism, Indian critics of modernity practise
    a sly form of &quot;strategic essentialism&quot; (Gayatri Spivak's term)
    that treats Indian traditions as unique to India which cannot be understood
    by outsiders. True national liberation will mean a rediscovery of India's
    unique gestalt, which, in the postcolonial narrative, lies in its holism,
    monism or non-dualism, as compared to the tendency of the Western science
    towards separation of objects from their context. Indian thought is not to
    be seen either as a copy of modern science, or somehow lacking in empirical
    sciences, but as encoding a wholly different kind of science altogether,
    which is the duty of post-secular, postmodern intellectuals to discover and
    cultivate. Coming from the traditions of the Gandhian and populist left, the
    postmodernists tend to find these alternative traditions among the
    non-modern habits of the heart of the humble, folk traditions of women,
    peasants, village folk and assorted subaltern groups. Gandhi became their
    patron saint of this uniquely Indian, non-modern way of life. &quot;Real
    India&quot; equals Gandhi equals &quot;innocent traditions&quot; of
    non-modern &quot;communities&quot;. Anyone challenging any of the factors in
    the equation was declared to have a &quot;colonised mind&quot;.
    <p align="justify">This critique of modernist
    nationalism-as-mental-colonialism has come to serve as the fig leaf for the
    postmodernists as they scramble to dissociate themselves from the
    contemporary Hindutva movement, which has also nailed its colours to &quot;decolonisation
    of the Indian mind&quot;. Nandy and his many admirers are trying to distance
    themselves from it by continuing with their critique of the Hindu
    nationalism as being wedded to modernism. They point to the modernist,
    scientistic rhetoric of Hindutva propagandists and proclaim Hindutva to be
    just one more symptom of modernity. The problem is that using modernist
    rhetoric does not make one modern. On the contrary, by framing the
    traditional Hindu worldview in a modernist vocabulary, Hindutva is co-opting
    modern ideas, giving traditions a modern gloss to make them palatable to the
    educated middle classes. Hindutva is a reactionary modernist movement that
    accepts the instrumental uses of science (that is, technology) but resists
    the secular enlightenment that is a necessary precondition of modernity.
    Hiding behind the great mascot of postmodern scholars, Gandhi - supposedly
    the guardian angel of the &quot;innocent&quot; folk traditions - does not
    work either, for Hindutva also claims Gandhi to be its own mascot. Hindu
    nationalists have no problem with Gandhi's deeply anti-secular and
    anti-modern world-view; they &quot;only&quot; dislike and disown his
    pacifism.
    <p align="justify"><font class="subsectionhead" color="red" size="3">Postmodernism
    and &quot;alternative sciences&quot;</font>
    <p align="justify">Yet, one could argue that just because postmodernist
    intellectuals have taken a position against the Enlightenment-style use of
    science as a cultural weapon against the authority of the traditions does
    not automatically make them an ally of the religious right. One could, after
    all, justly criticise the role of science and technology in furthering
    Western exploitation of the colonies and perpetuating patronising attitudes
    toward the natives. Science is not beyond criticism, and critics of science
    do not automatically deserve condemnation.

    <p>&nbsp;
    <p align="justify">The problem is that postmodernist intellectuals do not
    stop at criticising any specific political abuse of scientific knowledge.
    Instead, they attack the very idea of objective knowledge as a myth of the
    powerful who want to claim the status of truth for their own self-serving
    social constructions of reality. Likewise, postmodernist attack on the
    &quot;Western-ness&quot; of science goes beyond pointing out any specific
    linkages between science and Western/imperialist interests. Instead they
    attack the claim of universalism of science as a cover for Western
    dominance.
    <p align="justify">Once they decry the very idea of objectivity and
    universalism, the critics open the gates wide to the idea of
    &quot;alternative sciences&quot;. The idea is that modern science offers
    only one way to classify, observe and understand the regularities of nature:
    there is nothing inherently objective and scientific about it. Other
    cultures, the argument goes, if they want to really &quot;decolonise their
    minds&quot;, must develop their own scientific methods which are in keeping
    with their own religion and culture - &quot;different cultures, different
    sciences&quot;, is the postmodern slogan. Since all knowledge rests on the
    shifting sands of myths, models and analogies (or &quot;paradigms&quot;, as
    the more technical name goes), which scientists just pick up through their
    textbooks, there is no reason why sciences of non-Western cultures cannot
    constitute new &quot;alternative universals&quot; that can be taught in
    textbooks and laboratories around the world.
    <p align="justify">These radical critiques of objectivity and universalism
    have become so popular that they have acquired a ring of truth among social
    critics. But all these arguments denigrating the rationality of science are
    based upon a flawed understanding of science that has been rejected many
    times by working scientists and prominent philosophers of science. A
    complete debunking of post-modern misunderstanding of how science actually
    works and why objectivity is possible despite the deeply social nature of
    science will require a different set of articles. Suffice it to say, the
    radical denigration of science has very little following among the
    mainstream of scientific community and in the mainstream of philosophy and
    history of science.
    <p align="justify">I now examine three distinct arguments that have emerged
    in the Indian postmodernist literature which converge almost exactly with
    the Hindutva's defence of the superiority of Vedic sciences. These three are
    the decolonisation argument, the anti-dualism argument and the symmetry
    argument.
    <p align="justify"><font class="subsectionhead" color="red" size="3">The
    decolonisation of science argument</font>
    <p align="justify">Hindutva ideologues see themselves as part and parcel of
    postcolonial studies. Decolonisation of the Hindu mind, the Hindu Right
    claims, requires understanding science through Hindu categories. Echoing the
    postcolonial critiques of epistemic violence, Hindutva ideologues such as
    Murli Manohar Joshi, Konrad Elst, Girilal Jain, David Frawley, N.S. Rajaram
    and others see any scientific assessment of the empirical claims made by the
    Vedic texts as a sign of mental colonialism and Western imperialism. Many of
    these Hindutva ideologues cite the work of postcolonial scholars such as
    Edward Said, Roland Inden, Ashis Nandy, Claude Alvares, Gayatri Spivak and
    subaltern studies historians with great respect.
    <p align="justify">The Hindu Right combines this demand for authenticity
    with an essentialist understanding of culture borrowed straight from Oswald
    Spengler's <i>Decline of the West,</i> which holds that each culture has an
    innate nature, a temper, which must guide all its cultural products from
    mathematics and physics to painting and poetry. This view of the innate
    nature of nation - the nation's <i>svabhava</i> or <i>chitti</i> - is
    propounded by Deen Dayal Upadhyaya's theory of &quot;Integral
    Humanism&quot;, which constitutes the official philosophy of the Bharatiya
    Janata Party. In fact, it is part of the BJP's official manifesto that it
    will use India's innate Hinduness as a &quot;touchstone&quot; to decide what
    sciences will be promoted and how they will be taught. Using this touchstone
    of an innate, timeless Hindu <i>svabhava</i>, Hindutva literature still
    holds on to the defunct theories of vitalism as valid science. (Vitalism in
    biology holds that living beings require a special vital force, variously
    termed <i>prana</i> or <i>shakti</i> in the Indian literature, over and
    above &quot;mere&quot; atoms and molecules. In India, Jagdish Chandra Bose
    first claimed to find evidence of consciousness in plants. Bose's work was
    falsified and rejected by mainstream biology in his own life-time. It is
    still touted as India's contribution to world science in Hindutva
    literature.) Again, it is against the touchstone of Vedanta that Hindu
    apologists feel justified in interpreting the paradoxes of quantum physics
    in a mystical manner. There are perfectly realistic explanations of quantum
    mechanics, which are sidelined in Vedic science literature, to claim that
    modern physics &quot;proves&quot; the presence of mind in nature, just as
    claimed by Vedanta.

    <p align="justify">The gist of this argument, as it appears in Hindu
    nationalist writings on Vedic science, is simple - all that is dangerous and
    false in modern science comes from the Semitic monotheistic habit of
    dualistic and &quot;reductionist&quot; thinking, which separates the object
    from the subject, nature from consciousness, the known from the knower. All
    that is truly universal and true in modern science comes from the Hindu
    habit of &quot;holistic&quot; thinking, which has always seen the objects in
    nature and the human subjects not as separate entities but as different
    manifestations of the same universal consciousness. For the non-logocentric
    Hinduism, reality is not objective, but &quot;omnijective&quot;, a
    co-construct of mind and matter together. While Western science treats
    nature as dead matter, Hindu sciences treat nature as a sacred abode of
    gods. Thus Hindutva scholars claim that traditions of yoga, transcendental
    meditation (TM) and Ayurveda are sciences of the future, for they bring
    matter in alignment with the &quot;cosmic energy&quot; that permeates all
    matter. Moreover, Hindu approaches to nature are seen as ecological by
    definition as they do not treat nature as mere matter to be exploited for
    private use.

    <p>&nbsp;
    <p align="justify">This view of superiority of Hinduism's &quot;holism&quot;
    rests upon the strange and totally mistaken assumption that Hindu
    chauvinists share with left-wing critics of science - that the fundamental
    methodology of modern science, what is called &quot;reductionism&quot;, is
    not just mistaken but politically oppressive. Reductionism in science simply
    means a bottom-up approach to understanding complex natural phenomena by
    first isolating the lower-level constituents and studying their interactions
    under controlled conditions. Reductionism seeks the explanation of the whole
    by eliminating the need for postulating any extra forces ( that is,
    consciousness, vital force and so on) over and above the relationships
    between the building blocks that can be experimentally tested. Far from
    being simple-minded or sinister, as critics assume, nearly every advance in
    understanding complex systems - from the DNA replication at the cellular
    level to ecological systems - owes its success to a reductionist approach to
    the fundamental building blocks of nature.
    <p align="justify">Owing to a fundamental misunderstanding of how science
    actually works, coupled with a great deal of cynicism, many left-wing
    critics among feminist, environmental and anti-imperialist movements have
    developed a knee-jerk condemnation of reductionism. Reductionist science is
    considered bad science with politically oppressive implications. Feminists,
    including such world-renowned feminist icons as Carolyn Merchant, Sandra
    Harding and Donna Haraway, see it as a masculine way of breaking the unity
    between the object and the subject. Environmentalists, including India's own
    Vandana Shiva and like-mined eco-feminists, see reductionism as opening the
    way to ruthless exploitation of nature by divesting it of all sacred
    meanings. (Eco-romantics ignore all counter-examples where sacredness of
    nature serves to control access over sacred groves, rivers and other
    resources of the commons.) Postcolonial critics, in their turn, see
    reductionism as a result of Western and capitalist habit of thinking in
    terms of opposed classes of `us and them'.
    <p align="justify">These kinds of ill-understood and politically motivated
    challenges to a fundamental methodological norm of modern science have
    prepared the ground for Hindutva's claims that Hinduism provides a more
    &quot;holistic&quot;, more complete, more ecological and even more feminist
    way of relating with nature. Most of the claims of superiority of
    &quot;holism&quot; are unsubstantiated. On closer examination, they end up
    affirming pseudo-sciences involving disembodied spirit acting on matter
    through entirely unspecified mechanisms. Most of the claims of greater
    ecological and feminist sensitivity in the Hindu practice of treating all
    nature as a sacred and interconnected whole turn out to be empirically
    false. In fact, quite often the faith in the divine powers of some rivers
    and plants serves as an excuse not to care for them adequately, precisely
    because they are considered to share God's miraculous powers to recover and
    stay pure. For all the falsehoods and obscurantisms, the claims of Hindu (or
    Eastern, more broadly) holism thrive in the academia because of the radical
    academics' own mistaken and overblown critique of the reductionist
    methodology of science.
    <p align="justify"><font class="subsectionhead" color="red" size="3">The
    symmetry argument</font>
    <p align="justify">The symmetry argument claims that all local sciences are
    equally &quot;scientific&quot; (that is, rational, coherent and able to
    explain observed phenomena) within their own cultural contexts. Modern
    science, the argument goes, ought to be treated &quot;symmetrically&quot;
    with all other ways of knowing. As we have seen, this is the crux of the
    social constructivist and postmodern attacks on modern science.
    <p align="justify">This argument lies at the heart of the theories of
    &quot;Vedic physics&quot; and &quot;Vedic creationism&quot;. That the verses
    of the Rig Veda are actually coded formulas of advanced theories of physics
    has been recently claimed by Subhash Kak, an engineer working in the United
    States. And a Vedic alternative to Darwinian evolution by natural selection
    is being pushed by Michael Cremo and his fellow Hare Krishnas in the U.S.
    What sets these newer theories is their unabashed and bold defence of Vedic
    mysticism as a legitimate scientific method within the Vedic-Hindu
    metaphysical assumptions, as rational and empirically adequate as the best
    of modern science, and as deserving of the status of universal objective
    knowledge as the conventionally accepted theories of matter and biological
    evolution.
    <p align="justify">In a barrage of books and essays, most recently
    summarised in the 1995 publication, <i>In Search of the Cradle of
    Civilisation</i>, Subhash Kak has claimed to find, in a coded form, advanced
    knowledge of astronomy and computing in the Rig Veda. According to Kak, the
    design of the fire altars prescribed in the Rig Veda - how many bricks to
    put where and surrounded by how many pebbles - actually code such findings
    of modern 20th century astronomy as the distance between the sun and the
    earth, the length of solar and lunar years and the speed of light. All the
    Vedic values match exactly with the values we know through modern 19th and
    20th century physics. The number of bricks and pebbles, moreover,
    corresponds with the number of syllables in the Vedic verses. The
    conclusion: &quot;the Vedas are books of physics.&quot;

    <p>&nbsp;
    <p align="justify">Finding relatively advanced abstract physics in the Rig
    Veda, the earliest of the four Vedas, is of crucial importance to Hindutva.
    There is a concerted attempt to prove that the Rig Veda was composed at
    least around three millennia B.C., and not around 1500 B.C as previously
    thought. There is also a massive effort afoot in Hindutva circles that the
    Aryans who wrote the Rig Veda presumably in 3000 B.C. were indigenous to the
    landmass of India. Under these circumstances, finding advanced physics in
    Rig Veda will &quot;prove&quot; that India was truly the mother of all
    civilisations and produced all science known to the Greeks and other ancient
    cultures.
    <p align="justify">But anyone making such dramatic claims has to answer the
    question: How did our Vedic ancestors know all this physics? What was their
    method?
    <p align="justify">Kak and associates (including David Frawley and George
    Feuerstein, co-authors with Kak of <i>In Search of the Cradle of
    Civilisation</i>) answer, incredibly, that the Vedic scientists found out
    the laws of physics through deep introspection. Yogic meditation allowed
    Vedic sages to see in their minds' eyes, the likenesses, homologies and
    equivalences between the cosmic, the terrestrial and the spiritual. This
    method of seeing analogies and equivalences may be considered magical in the
    West, they argue, but it is perfectly scientific within India's non-dualist,
    monist metaphysics which allows no distinctions between matter and spirit,
    between physical and the psychic, between animate and the inanimate - all
    are united by the same spiritual energy that is in all. Within these
    assumptions, yogic introspection is a method of science. Because all science
    is paradigm-bound, Kak <i>et al</i> insist, citing the authority of Thomas
    Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend, the much-misunderstood gurus of postmodernists,
    Vedic science is perfectly scientific within the paradigm of Vedic
    assumptions.
    <p align="justify">In fact, Kak <i>et al</i> are not alone in defending the
    scientificity of yogic meditation as a valid scientific method. Maharishi
    Mahesh Yogi's &quot;unified science&quot; is based upon this logic. This
    kind of cultural defence is routinely invoked by those defending such
    esoteric pseudo-sciences as Vedic astrology and paranormal beliefs
    (past-birth memories, out-of-body experiences and reincarnation).
    <p align="justify">A similar defence of the method of bhakti yoga as a
    legitimate source of holistic knowledge lies at the basis of the enormous
    mass of writings coming out of the Bhakti Vedanta Institute in the U.S., the
    headquarters of the Hare Krishnas. In a new book, <i>Human Devolution</i>,
    Michael Cremo, a devout Hare Krishna, has boldly proposed a Vedic
    alternative to Darwinian evolution. Cremo claims that human beings have not
    evolved up from lower animals, but rather fallen, or devolved, from their
    original unity with pure consciousness of <i>Brahman</i>. (In a previous
    book, <i>Forbidden Archaeology</i>, Cremo and his associates tried to prove
    that the fossil record actually supports the Vedic time scale of literally
    millions of years of life on earth, including human life.) As evidence,
    Cremo cites every possible research in paranormal ever conducted anywhere to
    &quot;prove&quot; the truth of holist Vedic cosmology which proposes the
    presence of a spiritual element in all matter (which takes different forms,
    thereby explaining the theory of &quot;devolution&quot;).

    <p>&nbsp;
    <p align="justify">This remarkable compendium of pseudo-science is premised
    upon the assumption that modern science is a prisoner of Western cultural
    and religious biases and, as a result, Western scientists have created a
    &quot;knowledge filter&quot; which keeps out the evidence that supports the
    Vedic cosmology. Their point is that once you remove the Western
    assumptions, the method of yoga can be treated as a legitimate source of
    scientific hypotheses. These Vedic knowledge-claims can be verified by the
    community of other yogic knowers who have &quot;purified&quot; their sense
    through meditation to such an extent that they can &quot;directly realise&quot;
    those signs from the spirit-world that are looked down upon by
    Western-trained scientists as &quot;paranormal&quot;.
    <p align="justify">Utterly incredible though they are, and utterly devoid of
    any empirical support, Vedic physics and Vedic creationism are being touted
    as serious scholarship based upon the assumption that different cultural
    assumptions sanction alternative methods as rational and scientific.
    <p align="justify">POSTMODERN intellectuals have taken their disillusionment
    with the many shortcomings of the modern world into a radical denunciation
    of modern science itself. They have denounced the status of modern science
    as a source of universally valid and objective knowledge as a sign of
    Western imperialism, patriarchal biases and Christian dualist thinking. Many
    prominent public intellectuals in India, sympathetic to populist, indigenist
    currents in left-inclined social movements, have embraced the postmodernist
    suspicion of science, and called for &quot;alternative sciences&quot; which
    reflect the cultural preferences of India's non-modern masses.
    <p align="justify">The question before the defenders of &quot;alternative
    sciences&quot; is this: What do they have to say to the defenders of
    &quot;Vedic sciences&quot;? For example, what reasons can they give against
    the supposed scientificity of Vedic astrology? Can they hold on their
    relativist view of all sciences as social constructs and yet challenge the
    scientisation of the Vedas that is going on in the theories of Vedic physics
    or Vedic creationism?
    <p align="justify">Any erosion of the dividing line between science and
    myth, between reasoned, evidence-based public knowledge and the spiritual
    knowledge accessible to yogic adepts, is bound to lead to a growth of
    obscurantism dressed up as science. It is time secular and self-proclaimed
    leftist intellectuals called off their romance with irrationalism and
    romanticism. It is time to draw clear boundaries between science and myth,
    and between the Left and the Right.
