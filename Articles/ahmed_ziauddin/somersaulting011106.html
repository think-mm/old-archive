			<font face="Verdana">A leading weekly, <i>The Economist</i>, in its 
			26<sup>th</sup> October 2006 edition wrote an article on Bangladesh 
			titled “Isn’t democracy wonderful?” The title turned out eerily 
			right in less then seventy-two hours, when, Bangladesh President 
			assumed “the functions of the Chief Advisor of the Non-Party 
			Care-taker Government in addition to his own functions under the 
			Constitution.” This decision was really “wonderful” as the worst 
			travesty of the Constitution. It seems Bangladesh President is 
			expert in jumping queues.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">There is now serious question whether 
			President’s assumption of the position of the Chief Advisor was 
			constitutional or not, whether it followed the constitutional 
			procedures or not. It is almost beyond doubt that the assumption was 
			unconstitutional, as it did not follow constitution’s ordained 
			sequences.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">As the tenure of the BNP-Jamaat alliance came 
			to an end at midnight of 27<sup>th</sup> October, on 28<sup>th</sup> 
			the President met two leading leaders of BNP and Awami League, 
			informed them of Justice K.M. Hasan’s inability to assume the 
			position of the Chief Advisor, contemplated by the Constitution as 
			the last retired Chief Justice, and according to news reports, 
			expressed his preparedness to lead the Care-taker Government.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">Amongst others, in a front-page appeal, the 
			editor of the <em>Daily Star </em>in today’s edition (29 October 
			2006), urged the President to stay away from controversy. He wrote, 
			‘..[President’s] offer of himself to head the caretaker chief came a 
			bit too early to be above all legal questions and propriety. There 
			are five distinct steps that need to be taken before the President 
			becomes a legal alternative.” The Awami League rightly rejected 
			President’s offer to take over the Care-taker Government so also the 
			Supreme Court Bar Association.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">The President, however, disregarded all 
			appeals, but most importantly, provisions of the Constitution. 
			Article 58 C provides six options, five of which have to be 
			exhausted first before the President could become Chief Advisor.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

			choice as opposed to phrase “may”, which is discretionary.</span></font></p>

			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">Here, the Constitution leaves no choice for the 
			President but to act exactly in this prescribed order. The use of 
			the word “shall” limits President’s power and obliges him to act 
			without fail.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">Moreover, the use of plural to denote “retired 
			chief Justices” and “retired Judges” means that the drafters of the 
			Constitution assumed that there could be more than one retired Chief 
			Justices and Judges. This is reinforced by the use of the 
			expression, “If no retired Chief Justice is available” and “If no 
			retired Judge of the Appellate Division” is available” in Article 
			58C (4) and Article 58C (5) respectively, which suggests that option 
			1 &amp; 2 is only completed when there is not a single Chief Justice is 
			available or willing to act as Chief Advisor, so also for the retied 
			Judge of the Appellate Division.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">This also is common sense interpretation. The 
			drafters of the Constitution could not have chosen a retired Judge 
			of the Appellate Division while still a retired Chief Justice was 
			around and willing. Equally, where a retired Appellate Division 
			Judge was available, the Constitution could not have opted for to 
			search a Chief Advisor from amongst citizens of Bangladesh. The idea 
			was rather simple; first exhaust searching retired chief justices, 
			then the retired Appellate Division Judges, then from among the 
			citizens of Bangladesh, and only then, if all efforts failed, the 
			President would assume the responsibility.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">If sequences of these constitutional mandates 
			are checked with time lines of facts and happenings on the ground, 
			it will be found how the President jumped the queue and turned from 
			the Defender of the Constitution to its demolisher. </font></span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">On Friday evening, 27 October, the President’s 
			office announced postponement of Saturday’s (28 October) oath taking 
			of Justice K. M. Hasan as Chief Advisor as he was “indisposed”, 
			while immediately, reports appeared in the media quoting persons 
			meeting Judge Hasan around the time, him being in good health, which 
			was confirmed in Judge Hasan’s own statement a day later, explaining 
			his inability to accept the position of the Chief Advisor, where 
			there was no reference of his reported indisposition. That was first 
			knock of President’s credibility.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">In any event, when Judge Hasan declined, the 
			President had no choice but to appoint the remaining retired Chief 
			Justice Mr. Mahmudul Amin Chowdhury. According to news reports, BNP 
			then offered to the President different interpretation to Article58 
			C (3) and (4) the Constitution against appointing Judge Chowdhury 
			suggesting that search for retired Chief Justice stops at two retied 
			Chief Justices and not Chief Justices.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">Although this is a non-starter argument, 
			because logically a retired Appellate Division Judge could not get 
			preference over a retired Chief Justice, but nonetheless, this was 
			serious question of interpretation of the Constitution, which never 
			arose before.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">In such a situation, the President had two 
			options; he could have invited imminent legal minds of the country 
			to share their views with him, or, most constitutionally, he should 
			have followed Article 107 of the Constitution.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>
			<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana">Article 107: 
			Advisory jurisdiction of Supreme Court</span></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><i>
			<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Verdana">If at any time it 
			appears to the President that a question of law has arisen, or is 
			likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public 
			importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme 
			Court upon it, he may refer the question to the Appellate Division 
			for consideration and the division may, after such hearing as it 
			thinks fit, report its opinion thereon to the President.</span></i></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">This provision has been there when there are 
			different interpretations of law with enormous public significance, 
			and there could not be anything more important than appointing a 
			Chief Advisor of a Non-Party Care-Taker Government to hold 
			parliament election to ensure continuity of country’s democratic 
			system.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">He did neither, instead, accepted argument 
			advanced by BNP as he himself said in his broadcast to nation after 
			assuming the position of Chief Advisor.&nbsp; He did not appoint the 
			third retired Chief Justice as the second Judge expired, which, 
			under the Constitution, he was obliged to. Meanwhile, the Judge 
			Chowdhury said to the press that he was not offered the 
			responsibility. Thus, the President has placed him in a very tight 
			corner, when the Care-taker Government is supposed to be 
			non-partisan too.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">He then rightly ignored option 3 as the retired 
			Judge is currently holding another Constitutional Position as the 
			Chief Election Commissioner, prohibited by Constitution’s provision 
			to hold to two such positions concurrently. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">The President should have then opted for option 
			4 but as it transpired from the statement to press of the Judge in 
			question Justice Hamidul Haque, he agreed to accept the position of 
			the Chief Justice on condition that if both parties agree about him, 
			since “different explanations of the Constitution’s Article 58 (C) 
			have surfaced.” In his letter to President, he said, he did not 
			express his inability to assume responsibility.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">Justice Hamidul Haque’s letter should have been 
			enough for the president to rigorously consider question of 
			different interpretation of Article 58 C by resorting to the Supreme 
			Court’s Advisory Jurisdiction. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">But, instead of following these procedures 
			scrupulously one after another, he threw baby out of bath and 
			offered himself the job of the Chief Advisor to two leaders of BNP 
			and Awami League yesterday, skipping all other provisions, option 4 
			&amp; 5, only to be reminded by the Awami League later to follow the 
			constitutional provisions.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">Then he invited only four political parties 
			today (29 October) and supposedly followed option 5 as he later 
			claimed in his speech. None of the participants of today’s meeting 
			reported President talking about to find a person, from among the 
			citizens of Bangladesh, qualified to be appointed as Chief Advisor. 
			He did not seek any name nor did he himself suggest any. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">When the nation was guessing about, he assumed 
			the position of the Chief Advisor, revealed to the nation only when 
			he was invited to take oath as the Chief Advisor at a swearing in 
			ceremony. This was an extremely non-transparent way to assume the 
			position of a supposedly non-partisan, neutral caretaker 
			administrator, to ensure holding of a transparent general election.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
			<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Century Schoolbook">
			<font face="Verdana">On the contrary, for the last few days, former

			pre- scripted event, where BNP-Jamaat were part of it and aware of
