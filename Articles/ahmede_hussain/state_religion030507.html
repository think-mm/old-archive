		<p class="style16" align="justify"><span class="style114">P</span>olitical use of 
		religion is not new in this part of the region. It dates back to the 
		days of the partition of the South Asian sub-continent when India and 
		Pakistan were created in Hindu and Muslim dominated areas of undivided 
		India. In fact our glorious Muktijuddho in 1971 and the subsequent 
		independence of Bangladesh itself has been a statement--that a state 
		cannot be run on the basis of religion alone, it should take into 
		account other factors like language and ethnicity into consideration. It 
		is no surprise then that the first constitution of Bangladesh rightly 
		incorporated secularism as one of the guiding principles of the new 
		country. Those who formed different paramilitary groups to oppose the 
		country's independence in the pretext that it was against Islam were 
		banned from forming political parties. </p>
		<p class="style16" align="justify">Religion, however, made a quick come back into the 
		country's politics in the aftermath of the murder of Bangabandhu Sheikh 
		Mujibur Rahman. Gen Ziaur Rahman, who seized power after a bloody coup 
		in 1975, indemnified the killers of Sheikh Mujib and removed secularism 
		from the constitution for &quot;Complete faith and Trust in Allah&quot;. From war 
		criminals to frustrated Marxists Zia had a place for everyone in his new 
		political bloc-- he practically rehabilitated big war criminals, some of 
		them in his own cabinet. In the politics of his wife Khaleda Zia, war 
		criminals have been crucial to consolidating power.</p>

		<p class="style16" align="justify">Ershad, Zia's predecessor, took it to a new 
		height--his visits to a certain Pir and different Mosques had been made 
		prime time news on national television; and when this vile person sensed 
		a mass upsurge brewing against his regime he made Islam the state 
		religion. Government subsidies on Islamic seminaries were increased 
		during the military rule, and it continued, if not gathered momentum, 
		after the restoration of democracy in 1990. </p>
		<p class="style16" align="justify">In the first general elections after democracy was 
		re-established in 1991, Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), which actively opposed 
		Bangladesh's liberation war in 1971, bagged a significant number of 
		seats in the national parliament; it was, in fact, with the blessings of 
		the JI that Khaleda Zia formed her first cabinet. Though the JI 
		regularly takes part in secular democratic process, in its constitution 
		the party denounces democracy and does not hide its objective of 
		establishing a Sharia-based Islamic rule. Islami Chatra Shibir (ICS), 
		the JI's student wing, is particularly fascist in nature-- the ICS is 
		believed to have carried out numerous acts of murder and rape in 
		different educational institutions across the country long before the 
		JMB joined the fray. It is a little wonder then that most of the JMB 
		leaders are also former members of the JI and ICS. </p>

		<p class="style16" align="justify">The international situation has also played its own 
		part in the radicalisation of an otherwise peaceful religion. The 
		invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Red Army attracted the attention 
		of some Bangladeshis who saw the war as an attack on Islam, and the US 
		help for the Mujahidins legitimised the cause more, making it look just 
		and holy to some Muslims around the world. Coupled with this are the 
		plights of Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza and the US led war on 
		Afghanistan and Iraq; many Muslims in Bangladesh, like in Pakistan, 
		Thailand and the Middle East, have found themselves as the victims of a 
		new Crusade, and the US's money-driven Imperialist foreign policy has 
		worsened the situation. Interrogations of detained Jihadists in the 
		custody of the security forces have revealed that most of the zealots 
		have been trained during the Afghan war and some of them have even 
		fought for the Talibans against the Soviet and US armies. </p>
		<p class="style16" align="justify">Bangladesh's so-called secular political parties 
		cannot avoid their share in radicalising Islam. After an election 
		debacle in 1991, the Awami League, the country's largest centre-left 
		party, dumped secularism and socialism, the party leaders boasted that 
		they were religious-- immediately before the 1996 general elections, AL 
		leader Sheikh Hasina, after a pilgrimage to Makkah, started wearing a 
		head-scarf and posters showing her praying were put on the walls of the 
		capital. The message has been unmistakably clear here: The AL, too, has 
		started to use Islam politically, and it can go to the farthest extent 
		to win a few Muslim votes. Whether that tactic, however deplorable that 
		is, has helped the party win the 1996 elections one cannot tell; but the 
		party, while in power, did not do little to restore its secular image 
		before a bemused electorate. Government subsidy on Madrassas and other 
		religious institutions continued, if not swelled. It is not surprising 
		that in the run-up to the January 2007 elections (the one that never 
		took place) the AL would forge an alliance with Islamic Shansontontro 
		Andolon and Khelafat Majlish (KM), both of which want to establish 
		Sharia in the country. The AL it seems has lost its secular objective to 
		a great extent, and last winter the party made a pact with the KM, 
		according to which the AL publicly declared that it would make fatwa 
		legal and no law contrary to Sharia would be enacted, a stance the AL 
		later revoked in the wake of severe criticism. The incident is just an 
		instance that shows to what extent the country's politicians--both 
		secular and religious--can go only to grab power. </p>

		the face of a massive government crackdown most of the members of the 
		JMB have gone into hiding. But newspaper reports reveal that the JMB has 
		mutated itself and the extremist outfit has resurfaced in different 
		parts of the country in new names--on the northern tip of the country, 
		the existence of a new militant group has been detected, this group, 
		formed by militant guru Abdur Rouf, who also founded the infamous 
		Harkat-ul Jihad Al Islami in Bangladesh, tells us that the war on terror 
		is a relentless process and cannot succeed without changing the existing 
		social fabric of Bangladeshi society. One cannot expect a country free 
		from fanaticism when all the major political parties use Islam 
		indiscriminately only to get a taste of power, a society free from 
		bigotry and religious intolerance cannot be established if its leaders 
		themselves preach violence and lawlessness in the name of Islam. 
		Hydra-like, Jihadist fanaticism has many faces with numerous colours and 
		shapes; the JMB is just one tiny dot in a simulacrum of intolerance and 
		bigotry that the country's politics have been plagued with. </p>
		<p class="style16" align="justify">Putting war criminals in the dock and banning them 
		from the country's politics have been one of the few unfinished legacies 
		of our Muktijuddho. It is a shame on us, a burden on our conscience that 
		bigots like Matiur Rahman Nizami, Delwar Hossain Saidee and Abdur Kader 
		Mollah--all of whom actively opposed our Muktijuddho and are alleged to 
		have carried out numerous acts of mass murder-- are still at large, not 
		only that, some of these fiends have been made ministers and MPs in 
		independent Bangladesh. They do talk of Islam more often than not, but 
		our sacred religion to them is nothing but a tool to fool the innocent 
		citizens of Bangladesh, a country, whose existence Nizami-Saidee-Kader 
		Mollah's never quite believed in. </p>
		<p class="style16" align="justify">This is high time that the interim government, as it 
		wants to cleanse the country's politics, forms a truth and 
		reconciliation to try the war criminals; their participation in politics 
		should be banned, so should the political use of religion and places of 
		worship. </p>

		<p class="style16" align="justify">Madrassa education must go through an overhaul: both 
		the Ebtadie and Kawmi systems have to be merged into one, and have to be 
		incorporated into the general education system. It makes very little 
		sense that in a small country like us there should exist three 
		discriminatory mediums of education-- Bangla, English and Arabic. Those 
		who talk of introducing Bangladesh's own brand of democracy should come 
		up with a uniform education system first. One does not have to go afar 
		to find one-- all the other countries in the region who have had a 
		modern secular state (Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia) have built its 
		&quot;own brand&quot; of education system, long before we have started thinking of 
		experimenting with democracy. One of the reasons why Madrassa students 
		feel so isolated from local reality is because the medium of Madrassa 
		education is Urdu and Arabic; more books on Islamic jurisprudence have 
		to be translated into Bangla, and there has to be one medium of 
		education. </p>
		<p class="style16" align="justify">Political use of religious symbols such as topi, 
		rosary and head-scarf has to be banned; the government has to take steps 
		to encourage modern scientific thinking among ordinary citizens. </p>
		<p class="style16" align="justify">One must keep this in mind that the arrest and 
		hangings of a few zealots alone will not remove religious intolerance 
		from our social fabric. Bigotry has many faces and it has to be fought 
		at every possible front; nabbing the zealots and bringing them to the 
		book is just a small battle in the big war on terrorism; the bigger 
		battle is to win the hearts and minds of the toiling masses, who live in 
		abject poverty, and where Jihadists spawn and thrive.</p>
