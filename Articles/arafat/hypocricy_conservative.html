  <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><font size="4" face="Verdana">The Hypocrisy 
	of the Conservatives- Right Wing Political Group&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="4">- Mohammad 
	Arafat</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Some Christian Fanatic called 
	Jerry Falwell along with other Christian Fundamentalists of the same line 
	claimed USA as a Christian nation. According to them it is the duty of the 
	civil servants to preserve the dignity of their heritage as a Christian 
	nation. Does the voice seem familiar? - The tone and the approach?&nbsp; We hear 
	all the time the similar tune from our radical Islamists in Bangladesh. In 
	the convention where the voices of the fundamentalist Christian were 
	uttered, were participated by innumerable so-called educated, polished, 
	suited and booted people. By appearance, they seemed to represent the most 
	sophisticated and educated class of America. Nevertheless, the speeches that 
	conveyed the state of their mentality vividly reflected the blindness and 
	the lack of knowledge of the other side of the coin. The other side of the 
	coin can be referred as to the state and sufferings and the subtle 
	segregation of the Muslim minority in the USA especially after 9/11. 
	Evidently Falwell and gang always lambaste the people who are for separating 
	the religion from the Sate i.e. secularism. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Their (fundamentalists) claims- 
	USA is a Christian nation and those who are in effort to secularize the 
	country are sinners. They believe the future civil servants of the country 
	ought to understand the ‘holy bible’ to understand the basis of the 
	constitution of the USA as well as the values on what USA is established.&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">I had a conversation with a 
	conservative Christian who happened to be a republican supporter and had a 
	high regard for Mr. George Bush after the US election. He claimed that 
	George Bush won the election on the ground of moral values. I asked him what 
	did he mean by morality and who set the standard for morality. His answer 
	was God. This is again the same blindness that grasps most of the human 
	being into dark. I asked him what if others did not share his set of 
	morality based on his belief how would he still call it morality. He was 
	mum. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Not every body in the world 
	believes in the same religion. Lots of people do not even believe in any 
	religion at all. Yet it is a common trend among the most of the 
	conservatives to impose their own set of believes on to others by 
	legislating their own values into constitution. They want to do so by the 
	power of their majority might. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Few days before some one in 
	‘Mukto-Alochona’ claimed ‘we Bangladeshis are majority Muslims. Isn’t it our 
	democratic right to form a true Islamic country?’ He in fact wanted a 
	referendum on the very issue and wanted peoples to decide whether Bangladesh 
	should be a Muslim country and expected 86% Muslims of Bangladesh will vote 
	for his agenda. Lots of radical Muslims in Bangladesh have the similar 
	desire. Similar claims have been made by BJP (Hindu Radical Political Party) 
	in India. Radical Christians in the USA also love to believe that USA is 
	formed on Christian ideology and desire to create a true Christian country. 
	All the groups mentioned above belong to a country where they are the 
	majority in terms of religion and frequently ignore the rights of the 
	minority. Being charged by the secularists of their disparaging attitude 
	toward the minority, the fundamentalists sometimes feign ostensible and 
	phoney sympathy to the minority.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">It is important to understand that 
	democracy does not only mean vote or polls. The person who wanted referendum 
	on whether or not Bangladesh should be a true Islamic country didn’t seem to 
	understand the very notion of democracy. His demand about the referendum 
	probably stems from his own position as a Muslim in Bangladesh and it’s 
	overwhelmingly majority Muslim population. Democracy doesn’t mean poll as I 
	said before, it is a state or condition where people enjoy equal rights. 
	Separation of religion from Sate is a prerequisite for fruitful democracy. 
	No matter how much security and safety is provided to the minority 
	population in Bangladesh, imposing the Islamic rule would be an unfair 
	treatment to them to make it an Islamic country in the first place. The 
	minority populations, just because of being small in number would be pushed 
	into live in a theocratic country where the country would be run by a 
	believe system that they do not share. Such situation is a big 
	discrimination to the religious minority population in the first place no 
	matter how many pledges are made to provide security and safety. This idea 
	is applicable for the minority Muslim population in India and in USA as 
	well. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">In the recent election in the USA 
	republicans won the race because of playing the religious trick. Majority of 
	Americans are conservative Christians, therefore, it was easy to win the 
	race if the campaign was based on Bible. John Kerry being a liberal and a 
	secularist chose to speak truth and fair as far as the religion or the 
	religious issues were concerned. He said he is a Catholic but do not believe 
	in transferring his article of faith on to other by making his faith into 
	legislation. In my opinion, recognizing every body’s right is a big part of 
	morality instead of any specific values dictated by any holy books, which is 
	not shared by all. To me imposing Christian Faith in USA, Hindu Faith in 
	India or Islamic Faith in Bangladesh and thereby ignoring the right of the 
	minority population is oppression of the majority and the most immoral thing 
	to do. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Howard Dean a progressive and 
	secularist democrat called George Bush as the most right wing extremist in 
	the recent history. George Bush proved to be a right wing extremist in 
	several occasions. While asked in the presidential debate about what kind of 
	person he wants to appoint as Supreme Court chief justice, he replied some 
	one who understand the core value of the US constitution and do not 
	misinterpret the constitution. What he meant was the interpretation of the 
	constitution should be in light of Bible what he believed was the basis of 
	their declaration of independence. We hear the similar kind of voices in 
	Bangladesh but in our case Islam is implicated. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">As democrats are known as liberals 
	and secularist therefore their representative John Kerry replied to the same 
	question by saying he wanted to appoint some one whose judgment would be so 
	fair that the judgment would not reflect the judge’s own identity whether he 
	is Christian, Muslim, Jewish or Black or White. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Right wing political parties are 
	always for the majority population therefore the minorities do not feel 
	secured under their rules. The example is in the USA the voice of right 
	wings is – “ We are majority Christian let’s make it a Christian country or 
	at least start the pledge of allegiance with God”. In Bangladesh the voice 
	of right wings is – “We are majority Muslims lets make it a Muslim country, 
	at least make Islam the sate religion or add Bismillah Hir Rahman ir Rahim 
	in the constitution.&nbsp; On the other hand the voice of Liberals tries to be 
	fair to all. Therefore the liberals do not intend to exercise their majority 
	might. According to the liberals and secularists all the religions should be 
	protected and all the religious people should be treated equally in their 
	state. The only way to do it is separating the religion from the state- 
	Secularism. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">It is worth noting about the 
	abysmal hypocrisy of the right-wingers as well as their unfathomable double 
	standard.&nbsp; The voice of the liberals/leftists/secularists is universal. They 
	support liberals everywhere they go. Right wing conservatives support the 
	right wing political group in their own country where they belong to the 
	majority. The same group of people is vigorously critical about the any 
	other right wing political group of different religion of the other country. 
	For instance, it was in the newspaper that the most of the Bangladeshi 
	people living in the USA supported John Kerry in the US election. I have 
	experienced and talked to so many people who bear right wing mentality but 
	voted for Kerry when it comes to US election.&nbsp; Does that mean these people 
	suddenly became liberals and secular minded or leftists? Unfortunately that 
	is not the case.&nbsp; Something has changed but that’s not the mentality but the 
	state of these people. The same people who belong to the majority class in 
	Bangladesh became minority in the USA and minorities always feel unsecured 
	under the rule of right wing political environment, therefore they turned 
	for the liberals and leftists despite having right wing mentality. The gift 
	of the liberals and the secularist is they are able to instill trust and 
	security onto the minority by their fair way of thinking and neutrality.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">There are some common provocative 
	political practices that are exercised by the conservatives and right wing 
	political parties. They often try to succumb their opponents by labeling 
	them as the enemy of the religion. Such tactic is very effective especially 
	if the majority of the population is very sensitive to religion and 
	irrational. To give credence to this claim it is justified to mention the 
	incident of George Bush and Dick Cheney’s false propaganda against John 
	Kerry and Democrat. Bush and Cheney stated in some public gathering in the 
	state of Arkansas that if Democrat comes to power Bible would be banned in 
	the state. Syndicated columnist Mark Shield and House minority leader Nancy 
	Pelosi substantiated in two different occasions about their opponents above 
	assertions.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">If the politics is measured on a 
	scale, which is often done, Liberals and Secularists always fall on the left 
	side. Democrats are considered as leftists in the USA. Same formula applies 
	in the case of Bangladesh. On the same scale BNP and four party alliances 
	fall on the right side of the scale and are considered right-wingers. The 
	purpose of this write-up was to expose the double standard of few who take 
	different stand for their own benefit instead of taking the stand for right 
	against wrong. </font></p>
