  <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I found the first yellow leaf on my 
  backyard today when the New York City was burning.<br>
  <br>
  The glass room is now lit with the soft caressing rays of the September's 
  maturing sun. The trees are covered with a thin and fresh layer of morning 
  dew. My diligent neighbor is out on board his noisy tractor, mowing his lawn. 
  Birds are still around but will soon start their flight to the warmer south. 
  Everything seems to be so perfect with the pristine smoothness that dwells in 
  suburban America. And yet nothing is the same, neither me nor my neighbor, nor 
  the yellow leaf, nor the birds nor the morning rays. The day is 9.11.2001, the 
  longest so far in the new millennium.<br>
  <br>
  But long before this controversy and this war on terrorism many of us somehow 
  sensed that the world around was becoming polarized in a dangerous fashion. 
  Many times in the past I was able to drown my discomfort in freshly morning 
  coffee- the news from Palestine and India, Kosovo and Bosnia, the broken 
  Bumiyan Buddha, the Hijacks and killings in Kashmir, The fiery mosques in 
  London and so many others. They made me sad but not horrified, concerned but 
  not shaken. But today is 9.11. The people around me are suddenly divided into 
  warring camps with a degree of readiness that would suggest only one thing- 
  the disease of hate and mistrust was suppurating and the incident just tore 
  away the surface scab in a quick painful slash. Now there is no going back to 
  the make-believe world of reconciliation that we lived in before 9.11. We are 
  now drafted en mass into a war that will smolder into its own predetermined 
  end making freedom and fairness some of its inevitable 'collateral damages'. 
  My amateur reading of history has time and again confronted me with a very 
  disturbing suggestion. One that had been put forward so eloquently by the 
  following statement of Ibn Khaldun, the14th century historian in his 
  masterpiece work, The Muqaddimah-an introduction to history.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;History can be understood, but it has neither goal nor essential novelty. It 
  is a repetition of similar patterns driven by the interplay of the same basic 
  elements: human acquisitiveness and aggression, the need for cooperation and 
  group solidarity, royal authority, and the corrupting effect of dominion and 
  luxury&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0pt">
  <br>
  <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I have often wondered whether there is 
  anything called freedom and fairness at all or is it perfectly natural to live 
  with this apparent irony- being born free but dying in various kinds of 
  chains, some personal and some institutional? Is this true irrespective of 
  every known parameter of our existence? Is it because of this impending horror 
  of dying in chains that we need a God, a prophet, and an imaginary system of 
  arbitration called morality and divine justice? Is this why the free human 
  spirit seeks indoctrination? Does submission to a given doctrine provide a 
  better alternative to a lifelong struggle of defining and confronting too many 
  threats of bondage? Does it answer the primordial question- why do I exist 
  despite all my limitations?<br>
  <br>
  To find the answer if we look at the history in general then we can probably 
  agree that one thing has never changed from Rome to Byzantium to London to 
  Moscow to Washington DC. The biggest driving force of humankind is the pursuit 
  of happiness and power needed for such pursuit. The system that is predominant 
  in the Western world never failed to recognized this key fact as it 
  transcended from imperial governments to colonialism to 19th century 
  capitalism and finally to globalized capitalism. Human acquisitiveness and 
  aggression is a generally recognized and almost revered axiom in the so-called 
  'civilized world'. Plainly no form of capitalism can exist without fueling 
  human greed though we must recognize that greed is no longer looked upon as a 
  vice but a rather honorable and distinguished entity renamed as consumer 
  confidence. The system operates with the simple but eternal natural law 
  applicable to all carnivores- you must kill to eat good as long as you are 
  strong enough and obey certain laws of the jungle. Oh yes you are also 
  expected to leave the skeleton for the scavengers.<br>
  <br>
  Somebody wrote that every individual judges the world in the light of his or 
  her childhood experience. Let me try to explore a little into my own.<br>
  <br>
  In the West Bengal of seventies we grew up looking at the red banner, singing 
  international and reading books with blood red covers. Communism like Islam 
  had the unique claim of covering every thick and thin of human existence. Like 
  Islam it was so unequivocally confidant about its ultimate ability to triumph 
  and liberate the mankind into an egalitarian world. A world inhabited by only 
  one kind of people under only one set of rules and one leadership. There would 
  be nothing else to evolve into because it would be a perfect, therefore 
  unchangeable system where everyone would have no choice but to live in peace 
  and prosperity. I distinctly remember how quickly we could put together a 
  solution to every crisis and controversy in the light of dialectic 
  materialism. From Vietnam to Nicaragua we thought we were millions strong, all 
  one soul in million bodies, all belonging to the nation of Proletarians. There 
  was music in the air, youth in the blood and resolve in the mind to fight the 
  imaginary evil. I distinctly remember the words of a popular poem by the 
  Bengali poet, Sukanta Bhattacharjee-<br>
  <br>
  <font color="mediumblue">Heroes!<br>
  They could bring storms from clear sky<br>
  Hark! Their stories soaked with blood<br>
  of occupants and the traitors<br>
  Scorched in bombs and roaring guns<br>
  still vivid in our memory.<br>
  </font><br>
  Everything seemed so simple, so inspiring, so precious that everything was 
  worth dying for.<br>
  <br>
  Well I escaped death just for being too young at that time but many of the 
  brightest Bengali youths didn't. If you talk about dying in vain, I cannot 
  think about vainer deaths than those. They were made to believe something 
  unreal, dishonest, strange and purely theoretical and then sent out to die for 
  it. And they complied because of one major reason. They were indoctrinated.<br>
  <br>
  So when their hopes collapsed, they saw the dishonesty of their leaders, they 
  were tortured, maimed and butchered by their one-time compatriots, they saw in 
  anguish that they lived with lies all those years, they were rejected, 
  ridiculed, thrown away into the garbage of history- did they remember the 
  songs they have sung in the streets, the sunshine of wild seventies that 
  shined upon the brows of their comrades? No they didn't.<br>
  <br>
  Many years later in USA I came back to revisit the magic of indoctrination 
  again. This time when in the post communism void the once forgotten political 
  Islam has emerged strong to challenge the so-called civilization afresh and 
  with the same degree of youthful rage- and sadly with the same old wine of 
  indoctrination in a new bottle. It has affected everyone from the stone 
  throwing boy in Gaza to the professor in the University. It is like an 
  infection that is easy to spread in the vulnerable population. You won't waste 
  much energy to nail down a few fundamental ground rules and your human bomb 
  factory is ready for business.<br>
  <br>
  And then they will sing the same song that the communists sang but may be in a 
  slightly altered way.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="mediumblue">Heroes!<br>
  They could bring bombs from the clear sky<br>
  Hark! Their stories soaked with blood<br>
  of infidels and the Godless<br>
  Scorched in falling towers and burning planes<br>
  still vivid in our memory.<br>
  </font><br>
  When I see those innocent stone throwing faces in Palestine I see my own face 
  in seventies when they brought home my heroes dead. In the bomb factories 
  their senseless tragedies were exploited to create more tragedies, more 
  doctrines to numb the common sense and more false promises to bewitch the 
  young minds. Nobody asks- What lies beyond liberation, what shall we do then? 
  Can we succeed are we organized enough? What are the prices to pay?<br>
  <br>
  Somebody must tell them that the evil dwells in human greed and that is common 
  to all humans, Muslims or non-Muslims. Evil belongs to the institutions 
  guarding their vested interest, religious or secular. They must realize that 
  God will not bring salvation to humans they have to painfully evolve and do it 
  themselves through centuries of suffering. This is exactly what the history 
  is. The atrocities committed by powerful nations in the past are in no way 
  better, actually much worse than those being committed today. At different 
  times different philosophers emerged to organize the oppressed humanity 
  against their oppressors but most of them suffered from a common mistake. They 
  assumed that the tyrants must be uniformly bad working against God and 
  humanity and therefore they must lack moral force. The oppressed on the other 
  hand are simple, pious, honest and God fearing and therefore morally superior. 
  They have nothing to lose but the chain and their common suffering makes them 
  each other's brother. So the straight way to salvation and permanent world 
  peace was presumed to be liberation and fall of the current oppressor. All 
  movements from time immemorial, from Rome to France, Mecca to Russia, 
  Bangladesh to Palestine- had been organized based of this fundamental and 
  simplistic principle. Drive out the oppressor and there comes the kingdom of 
  Heaven or dictatorship of Proletariat on this earth. And by definition Heaven 
  or Proletariat can't be anything but all good so everyone must live in peace 
  and prosperity forever.<br>
  <br>
  They all ignore the biological aspect of human organism. Like all other 
  animals Humans want a few things dictated by the very basic genetic drives. 
  Those drives are territorial (in case of humans territory includes wealth as 
  well) and sexual (to gain the best sexual partners in order to have the best 
  possible offspring). These drives are common to all humankind, both oppressed 
  and oppressors and they are stronger than any kind of philosophy or doctrine. 
  So even after a successful revolution when the tables are turned the old vices 
  creep into the new order and thus creating slowly but surely another set of 
  tyrants and oppressors. They will find loopholes into the tenets of the new 
  doctrine to perpetuate subordination and exploitation to another set of 
  victims. In order to maintain power and dominance all regimes must have their 
  victims until the victims are strong enough to organize and create resistance 
  and the cycle is repeated again.</font></p>

  <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Islam as an institution (not as a 
  personal faith to individual people) has declined to accept the concept of 
  plurality for long enough time and adhered to the 'one rule one solution for 
  all' idea. It has promoted the cult like obsessive following of one 
  individual's words, opinions, lifestyle and even physical appearance (no 
  matter how great he could have been) for eternal time. It does provide a 
  degree of certainty, a level of psychological comfort, a definite resolve and 
  certain kind of peace to its devoted followers. These are the It also provides 
  a spiritual jump-start to special population groups who are in a state of 
  confused desperation to begin with. It identifies a cause and goal for the 
  angry youths that have some genuine reasons to be angry. Thus the so-called 
  'original Islam' is so popular among marginal groups like Afro-Caribbean who 
  have a real or perceived sense of being persecuted. Thanks to the profiteering 
  policy of the West there is no dearth of such populations in today's world. 
  The so called civilized world continues to ignore and subtly oppress large 
  groups of people who will try to organize under the banner of the first 
  available regimenting philosophy for offering some kind of collective 
  resistance- Communism or Islam or something else. God has nothing to do with 
  it. It is a purely biological human species characteristic.</font></p>
