	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A Muslim father-in-law is alleged to 
	have raped his young daughter-in-law, early June this year, in a village in 
	Muzaffar Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh, India. Since then we are getting 
	contradictory versions about the sickening story. What is, however, 
	incontrovertible is that a cleric of the Deoband Madrassa, the most 
	influential Islamic seminary in South Asia, has issued a fatwa (religious 
	decree) proclaiming that the rape victim cannot live together with her 
	husband, as per the Shariah law, she has been turned into her husband’s 
	“mother”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is even more loathsome is that 
	the Deoband mullah even flouted the traditional Shariah law by remaining 
	silent about the incestuous rape by the father-in-law. He has prescribed no 
	punishment for the rapist. The most disgusting is the role of the average 
	Muslims in South Asia and elsewhere. They have not come forward in large 
	numbers protesting this cruel fatwa, which violates both the Islamic and 
	secular codes of conduct everywhere. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is not for the first time and 
	unfortunately, not for the last time either, that a woman has fallen victim 
	to the barbaric Shariah law in another part of the world. Although it is 
	heartening that various Sunni and Shiite ulama (theologians) and laymen, 
	human rights groups, feminists and members of the civil society across the 
	world have come forward condemning this inhuman edict, there is little 
	commotion in the Muslim World in general and the Muslim intelligentsia in 
	particular as one noticed in the wake of the desecration of the Holy Quran 
	by some American soldiers at Guantanamo Bay prison camp in the recent past.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is really very sad that whenever 
	someone writes against Islam or utters something “blasphemous” against Islam 
	and its Prophet, the Muslim community is stirred up like an all devouring 
	tsunami or volcano, but it hardly takes any notice of systematic, organized 
	and sporadic violations of human rights and human dignity by the 
	self-proclaimed custodians of Islam anywhere in the world. While mullahs in 
	general glorify the anti-Islamic “Islamic” regimes and despots, Muslims in 
	general are at best apathetically indifferent to all obscurantist ideas and 
	practices promoted in the name of their religion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since dissidents take the risk of 
	getting branded as Murtads or apostates (liable to execution as per the 
	obscurantist Shariah), the Muslim World has very few dissidents and 
	freethinkers to question and challenge the backward looking, semi-literate 
	mullahs. Since mullahs have powerful protectors in the ruling elite and 
	other vested interest groups who profit by subjugating/depriving women, 
	minorities and other underdogs, they get away with whatever they say and do 
	in the name of Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, there is a thin silver 
	lining in the horizon. Although most ulama are silent about the obnoxiously 
	misogynous fatwa, while other blind adherents of the cleric are crying 
	hoarse asserting that the incident of rape is a cooked up story, 
	manufactured by the media, several Muslim scholars, human rights activists 
	and feminist groups have openly condemned the fatwa, both within and outside 
	India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whether the rape has actually taken 
	place or not is immaterial now. What is significant here is yet another 
	public exposure of the bankruptcy of the Shariah-bound, fatwa wielding 
	mullah. This fatwa has given a golden opportunity to the progressive Muslims 
	to corner and overtake those Muslims who find no faults with the Shariah, 
	which is devoid of the spirituality of the Quran and violates human rights 
	and dignity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This repulsive fatwa is not that 
	different from an edict by the late Sheikh Jadd al-Haq of Al-Azhar, the most 
	famous Egyptian seminary. This Sheikh publicly defended (in an interview 
	with the BBC in 1997) the cruel, un-Islamic, Afro-Arabian tradition of 
	female genital mutilation as “Islamic” and as an &quot;antidote&quot; to HIV 
	infection. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, thanks to the Deoband and 
	Al-Azhar fatwas, one is fully convinced that most mullahs, representing both 
	the “great” and “little” traditions of Islam, are bunch of inconsiderate 
	people, having little or no respect for human rights, peace and justice for 
	all. It is high time to convey the message to the unaware Muslims that 
	neither the Shariah nor its custodians are divine, holy or infallible.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is high time to pinpoint the thin 
	and sometimes non-existent, demarcating line between the “great” and 
	“little” traditions of Islam. The former, scripture based formal rituals and 
	beliefs, has always compromised with the grassroots based, traditional, 
	syncretistic, informal traditions, beliefs and practices everywhere in the 
	Muslim World. So what goes in the name of “pure Islam” is actually an 
	amalgam of Arabian, Persian, Indian, North African (Berber), pre-Islamic, 
	Biblical and tribal traditions/superstitions and the scripture based “great” 
	traditions of Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is the precise reason why we 
	find pre-Islamic Byzantine (Greek) harem and Sassanid (Persian) veil, along 
	with hundreds of non-Islamic (un-Islamic as well) customs, beliefs and 
	rituals incorporated into Islam as integral parts of the faith. Misogyny and 
	patriarchy, which are common legacies of almost all the civilizations, are 
	very much integral parts of Islamic and other traditions. The obnoxious 
	Deoband fatwa is reflective of the preponderance of the inherent misogyny, 
	found in every culture. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mullahs in Pakistan and Bangladesh 
	have penalized thousands of raped women during the last fifty-odd years. The 
	ignorant mullahs simply fail to distinguish between adultery/fornication and 
	rape by their insistence on having four “eye-witnesses” (necessary for 
	proving adultery and fornication) as evidence of rape. However, they hardly 
	refrain from punishing the victims for “committing” the sin. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whether we impute this laxity or 
	stupidity of the mullah to their incomplete access to the spirit of Islam or 
	to their dependence on corrupt, vested interest groups or to patriarchy and 
	male chauvinism (as all mullahs are men), we must not allow this 
	highhandedness any longer. Enough is enough. Since several Shiite and 
	radical Sunni ulama have condemned the Deoband cleric for his imbecility and 
	preferring Shariah law to the Quran, this is the time to weaken the base of 
	obscurantism and intolerance nourished by the mullah. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Islam does not allow any 
	formal clergy, the Muslims can live without incompetent ulama, who have 
	little to no access to modern knowledge in any discipline – liberal arts or 
	social sciences, let alone the natural sciences. It is an anathema to 
	consider ignorant clerics as ulama or scholars. And if it is stupidity to 
	rely on them for interpreting and protecting Islam, it is sheer madness to 
	entrust them with power, judicial or executive.</font></p>
