	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As expected, some Islam-bashers like 
	Syed Kamran Mirza and Mohammad Asghar have responded (NFB, May 9, 2005) to 
	my earlier posting in the NFB, “Sex with Slave Girls and POWs in the Hadis 
	Literature”. And as I pointed out earlier, both the mullah and Islam-basher 
	love to cite Hadis and defective translations of the Quran, including those 
	by Pickthal and Yusuf Ali and all the Bengali translations that I have come 
	across. While mullahs (including most Maulanas, Muftis and Shaykh-ul-Hadises 
	everywhere in the world) rely on Hadises and “convenient interpretations” of 
	the Quran to defend Islam and his pre-modern ideas in support of patriarchy, 
	absolute monarchy, polygamy, concubinage and slavery, Islam-bashers rely on 
	the same books to demolish Islam, out of malice or conviction. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I first tackle the prolific Syed 
	Kamran Mirza. It seems, Syed Sahib is very angry with me and quite for 
	sometime, I guess, he was looking forward to an opportunity to knock me down 
	with his malicious “logic”. What I regret most is his resorting to lies as 
	he has claimed that “whenever he [Hashmi] got no clues to respond my 
	challenge, he hide behind the dark screen [sic].” Nothing could be more 
	inaccurate than what Mirza has asserted above, in his faulty prose. I do not 
	think Mr Mirza suffers from such amnesia that he cannot recall my rebuttal 
	to his earlier assertions, I think sometime in 2003 in the NFB, and since 
	then he did not respond to any of my postings, until he has gathered some 
	courage to face me. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If you do not want to remember Mr 
	Mirza, I remind you what happened. You wrote in your unique style of making 
	unsubstantiated claims that (a) honour killing of wives was only prevalent 
	among Muslims and that (b) most people got killed throughout history in 
	battles and wars fought in the name of religion. In my rebuttal I wrote that 
	(a) honour killing was practised (still practised today) in Brazil. 
	University professors and judges killed their wives with impunity for 
	committing adultery (it was shown on a TV documentary). It is also practised 
	among the Sikhs and some tribes in Africa. (b) I also wrote that the two 
	world wars, and hundreds of other wars waged by Alexander, Napoleon, Halagu 
	Khan and others were not fought in the name of religion. You have not yet 
	respond to that posting. I know, how can you disprove established facts?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, you have gathered enough 
	courage to face me again. Congratulations! I am surprised at your audacity 
	to write: “Mr Hashmi has the audacity to compare Iraq’s incidence 
	[“incident” is the right word, Mr Mirza] of Abu Ghraib (as he said “rape and 
	abuse of POWs, a la Abu Ghraib”) with the most uncivilized acts of the 7th 
	century.” Mr Mirza further claims that US soldiers did not rape POWs in Iraq 
	and poses the question to me if I am aware of Pakistani soldiers’ raping 
	Bangladeshi women in 1971. What eyewash! I wish the Pentagon and Daniel 
	Pipes read this piece by you to duly reward you for defending the US war 
	criminals! You have cited certain Quranic verses, albeit with the defective 
	translations, to prove that Islam allows sex with slave girls and POWs. I am 
	re-producing the same verses with the correct translations and contextual 
	interpretations for your knowledge and guidance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The oft-cited Quranic verse 
	(ironically both by mullahs and Islam-bashers), Surah Al-Ahzaab (revealed in 
	Medina), 33:50 actually means: “ We [God] have made lawful for you, O 
	Prophet, wives to whom you have given their dowers, and God-given maids and 
	captives you have MARRIED…. This is a privilege only for you [Prophet] and 
	not the other believers.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The problem with the above verse is 
	that many translators and interpreters have wrongly assumed that the phrase, 
	“Malakatu Aimanukum”, stand for “What your right hands possess” or slave 
	girls. Actually the phrase stands for: “What your right hands have pledged 
	or married”. As for example, Ayesha’s self-identification as a wife of the 
	Prophet of Allah in Arabic was: “Malakani Rasul Allah” (The Prophet of Allah 
	married me). One may get further clarifications from the following verse: “… 
	And to those you have given your pledge in marriage give their share, for 
	God is witness to everything” [ Surah Nissa, revealed in Medina, 4:33]. Here 
	the expression “ Malakatu Aimanakum”, stands for “marriage”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We also come across in Surah Nissa 
	the following verse, which Mr Mirza has used to vilify Islam: “ Also 
	forbidden are married women unless they are captives (of war), such is the 
	decree of God. Lawful for you are women besides them if you seek them with 
	your wealth for wedlock and not for debauchery.” [4:24] </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims just cannot have sex with 
	POWs or slaves without marrying them first. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Contrary to the motivated 
	translation/interpretation, the verses 23:1-7 [Surah Al-Muminun, revealed in 
	Mecca] tell us the following: “ The true believers will be successful, who 
	are humble in their service, who shun all frivolities, who strive for 
	betterment, who guard their sex, except for their wives, and ‘women slaves 
	of old’ [who had been in possession of their masters since the pre-Islamic 
	days] are free from blame.” The verse 7 of Surah Al-Muminin only accepts the 
	fait accompli – slave girls whose masters had been sleeping with them since 
	the pre-Islamic period, were allowed to do so. It is just a case of allowing 
	NOT promoting the pre-Islamic custom. We find the same injunction in Surah 
	Al-Maarij (Meccan), verses 29-30: “And those who guard their sex except from 
	their wives and women slaves of old, are free of blame.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Prophet, despite his intentions, 
	could not abolish slavery and the pre-Islamic custom of grabbing POWs as 
	booties—slaves and sex objects. After the Battle of Hunayen, Prophet’s 
	attempt to release the female POWs was resisted by his companions. One 
	Sahaba grabbed his robe and told the Prophet sternly: “You cannot deprive us 
	from these female POWs, this is our age-old custom.” The Prophet without any 
	police force, judiciary and regular army, could not enforce his desire.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, to turn to Mr Asghar’s comment, 
	I agree with him that “Islam defenders” give the “information” to the 
	Islam-bashers (Hadis, Fiqh and motivated interpretations of the Quran). Yes, 
	this is the problem I have been pinpointing in my assertion against Shariah 
	and Political Islam. Ibn Ishaque, Tabari and the Hadis literature and people 
	like Ghazzali, who considered wives as slaves, created problems for the 
	Muslims and Islam. We want to get rid of these Hadis-Fiqh based Islam.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The other answers to your queries 
	and assertions have been answered above. My rebuttal here does not mean that 
	I want non-believers to believe in what the Quran says -- not at all. I just 
	making things straight factually, as the concocted versions of the Quranic 
	text create prolems for both Muslims and non-Muslims. </font></p>
	<hr>
	<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#800000">More on Sex with 
	Slave-girls and Captive-Women </font></p>
	<p align="center"><b><font color="#000080">Abul Kasem</font></b> </p>
	<p align="center">May 11, 2005 </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I read quite a number of posts on 
	the sexual use of slave-girls and captive women in Islam. It is quite 
	amusing to note the desperation of a few ‘Islam lovers’ to save Islam from 
	the stigma of abysmal sexual exploitation of slave-women and women-captives 
	caught in a war. Here is what the ‘real Islam’ says about having sex with 
	slave-girls and captives (women, of course). These passages are extracted 
	from my detailed essays: ‘Sex and Sexuality in Islam’ and ‘Root of 
	Terrorism—Islamic Style.’ </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My question is: Who knows Islam 
	best?—the Imams, the impeccably qualified (Islamically, of course), Mullahs, 
	the pirs, Tabari, Ghazali, Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa’d, Sahih Hadith, Hedaya (Hanafi 
	Laws of Islam, vetted by the Inns of Law, London to be the most authentic), 
	Umdat al-Salik (the most authentic Shafi Laws, authenticated by the Al-Azhar 
	Islamic University) or the western educated, western-settled Muslims who 
	claim they have discovered a new brand of Islam---Islam sans politics, and 
	of late, Islam sans those obnoxious ahadith? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When we point out from those 
	impeccable Islamic sources the ‘true’ and unadulterated Islam preached and 
	practiced by Muhammad, these New Islamic scholars would quote from 
	personalities such as: Gandhi, Carlyle, Barnard Shaw, John Esposito……..to 
	demonstrate the ‘beautiful’ face of Islam. It is as if these kaffirs know 
	Islam more/better than Muhammad did! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This gets very funny indeed! How 
	about those despicable verses in the Qur’an that unmistakably demonstrate 
	the utter sexual perversion, vis-à-vis slave-girls and captive women? Are 
	these new Islamically educated, western-inclined Islamic scholars ready to 
	discard those Qu’ranic verses as well? I would like to hear from them. This 
	will really be very interesting, no doubt. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Any way, here are those ‘real 
	Islamic’ excerpts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Excerpts from ‘Sex and Sexuality in 
	Islam’: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From an Islamic Q &amp; A site: </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Right Hand’s Possessions
	<a href="http://www.binoria.org/q&a/miscellaneous.html#possessions">
	http://www.binoria.org/q&amp;a/miscellaneous.html#possessions</a>&nbsp; 
	’Question: <b>What is the meaning of right hand possession</b> and what was 
	the purpose of having them. Some brothers in America think it is okay to 
	have right hand possessions now in the USA. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Answer: </font></b></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Right hand possessions (Malak-ul-Yameen) 
		means slaves and maids, those came in possession of Muslims through war 
		or purchase. After having the possession of slave maid it is lawful and 
		correct to have sexual relation with them. Even today if Muslims get 
		possession over infidel country, this condition is possible, lawful and 
		correct.’ </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Please peruse the above statement 
	once again. What is the implication of this Mullah’s opinion? I must 
	appreciate the Mullah for his utter honesty with respect to ‘real Islam.’ He 
	did not beat around the bushes. He has given a straight-forward, 
	unadulterated, pure and unambiguous answer that clearly conforms to the 
	rules of Qur’an and hadith. May I ask the Islamic apologists to say a few 
	words about this honest reply from this Mullah? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">……………………………………………………………………………….
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You might still think this to be 
	impossible. But, wait! The Pakistani Islamic army did just that in 
	Bangladesh in 1971. They killed about 3 million Bangalees terming them as 
	not so good Muslims, took 250,000 Bengali women as concubines and raped 
	them—many of them repeatedly, and not very far off from their near and dear 
	ones. In recent times, we have heard many such reports from the Taliban 
	ruled Afghanistan. These disturbing acts may enrage a lot of people 
	including many Muslims. Think again. Have the Islamic soldiers committed any 
	crime/sin as far as Islam is concerned. The answer is a simple “NO.” 
	Therefore, doesn’t it make sense to realise that it is the Islam itself that 
	is the motivating factor for the rape of the captive women? In Iran, a woman 
	charged with adultery/blasphemy/apostasy which carry death penalty become a 
	captive of the Islamic state. Therefore, an Islamic guard is appointed to 
	have sex with her repeatedly before she is executed. This, the Islamists 
	laud is a beautiful and “humane” treatment of infidel women prisoners in 
	Islam! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Sex with slave-women </font></b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This one is also a hot topic worthy 
	of discussion. So far, we learnt the truth about the sexual exploitation of 
	women taken in a war. This is not the only means by which unlimited sexual 
	gratification is possible in a ’halal’ way. Buying and selling of women as 
	sex slaves is fully permitted in Islam. It is a perfectly a legitimate way 
	to acquire as many sex-slaves as possible. Sky is not the limit, though. The 
	only limitation is the affordability. One may say that this type of flesh 
	trading is no more practiced today. This is true. However, nothing can 
	prevent the Islamists from re-introducing the slave markets as per Qur’an 
	and Sunnah when their ‘Jihad’ against the infidels is successful. Sexual 
	slavery is absolutely legitimate in Islam. If Islam conquered the world 
	slavery could have never been eradicated, because Islamic laws are written 
	on granite stone and are absolutely unchangeable. So, if Islam conquers the 
	infidel countries there is nothing that could prevent the Islamic zealots 
	from re-introducing the slavery system and the slave markets around the 
	globe for trading in female bodies of infidel women. If the Islamists can 
	re-introduce the amputation of hands and feet for theft, stoning to death 
	for adultery, beheading for apostasy and many other barbaric Sha’ria rules, 
	what will prevent them from re-introducing Islamic slavery? Please do think 
	about this. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhammad himself had a Coptic slave 
	that was presented to him by the ruler of Alexandria in Egypt. When the 
	delegate from Muhammad visited this Coptic head of Egypt (Muaqaqis) with an 
	invitation for him to convert to Islam he politely refused to do so, but 
	knowing the taste of Muhammad, he presented Muhammad with two beautiful and 
	sexy slave-girls who were sisters. Muhammad took for himself Mariya, the 
	most beautiful one and gave her sister, Sirin, to his poet friend, Hassan 
	ibn Thabit for him to enjoy her. Please note that neither Muhammad nor Hasan 
	b. Thabit married these slave-girls. Mariya gave birth to Ibrahim, 
	Muhammad’s last child who died at infancy. Sirin bore a son named Abdul 
	Rahman to Hassan, the poet (ref. 10, p. 498-499). All these historical 
	records are absolute proof that enjoying a female slave is totally ‘halal’ 
	in Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here are a few more ‘gems’ from 
	ahadith. Please peruse the following divine sanctions and judge for yourself 
	the mercy, blessing, tolerance, and last but not the least, fairness towards 
	women in Islam when it comes to sex. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You can have sexual intercourse with 
	two slave girls at a time without ghusl (bath) but can’t do like this with 
	free women…(Malik’s Muwatta 2.23.90) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Malik’s Muwatta:Book 2, Number 
	2.23.90: Yahya related to me from Malik from Nafi that the slave girls of 
	Abdullah ibn Umar used to wash his feet and bring him a mat of palm leaves 
	while they were menstruating. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Malik was asked whether a man who 
	had women and slave girls could have intercourse with all of them before he 
	did ghusl. He said, &quot;There is no harm in a man having intercourse with two 
	of his slave girls before he does ghusl. It is disapproved of, however, to 
	go to a freewoman on another's day. There is no harm in making love first to 
	one slave-girl and then to another when one is junub.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Malik was asked about a man who was 
	junub and water was put down for him to do ghusl with. Then he forgot and 
	put his finger into it to find out whether it was hot or cold. Malik said, 
	&quot;If no filth has soiled his fingers, I do not consider that that makes the 
	water impure.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is something that will break 
	your conscience as it did even the conscience of stone-hearted, cruel Hazrat 
	Umar. This hadith tells us that before banning by Umar it was okay to have 
	sex with a slave mother and her young daughter one after the other. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If a woman and her daughter were 
	both slaves (or captive) then you can’t have sex with one of them after the 
	other. Umar forbade this practice…(Malik’s Muwatta 28.14.33) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Malik’s Muwatta:Book 28, Number 
	28.14.33: Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Ubaydullah ibn 
	Abdullah ibn Utba ibn Masud from his father that Umar ibn al-Khattab was 
	asked about a woman and her daughter who were in the possession of the right 
	hand, and whether one could have intercourse with one of them after the 
	other Umar said, &quot;I dislike both being permitted together.&quot; He then forbade 
	that. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If both sisters are slaves (or 
	captives) then you may or may not have sex with them depending on the 
	interpreter…(Malik’s Muwatta 28.14.34) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Malik’s Muwatta:Book 28, Number 
	28.14.34: Yahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab from Qabisa ibn 
	Dhu'ayb that a man asked Uthman ibn Affan whether one could have intercourse 
	with two sisters who one owned. Uthman said, &quot;One ayat makes them halal, and 
	one ayat makes them haram. As for me, I wouldn't like to do it.&quot; The man 
	left him and met one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah 
	bless him and grant him peace, and asked him about it, and he said, &quot;Had I 
	any authority and I found someone who had done it, I would punish him as an 
	example.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ibn Shihab added, &quot;I think that it 
	was Ali ibn Abi Talib. &quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sexual perversion is fully permitted 
	when a slave-girl is involved. We find in HEDAYA that a man can have sex 
	with his slave-girl in any manner although he has restrictions while doing 
	this with his own wife/s. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You can have sex with a slave-woman

	female slave in whatever way he pleases—It is lawful for a man to perform 
	the act of Azil (i.e. coitus interruption—writer) with his female slave 
	without her consent, whereas he cannot lawfully do so by his wife unless 
	with her permission. –The reason of this is that the Prophet has forbidden 
	the act of Azil with a free woman without her consent but has permitted it 
	to a master in the case of his female slave. Besides, carnal connexion is 
	the right of a free woman for the gratifying of her passion, and the 
	propagation of children (whence it is that a wife is at liberty to reject a 
	husband who is an eunuch or impotent); whereas a slave possesses no such 
	right.—A man, therefore, is not at liberty to injure the right of his wife, 
	whereas a master is absolute with respect to his slave. If, also, a man 
	should marry the female slave of another, he must not perform the act of 
	Azil with her without the consent of her master. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And here are a few more ‘gems’ from 
	Islam </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Father can give his slave-girl to 
	his son to do conditional things…(Malik’s Muwatta 28.15.38) Malik’s 
	Muwatta:Book 28, Number 28.15.38: Yahya related to me from Malik from 
	Ibrahim ibn Abi Abla from Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan that he gave a slave-girl 
	to a friend of his, and later asked him about her. He said, &quot;I intended to 
	give her to my son to do such-and-such with her.&quot; Abd al-Malik said, &quot;Marwan 
	was more scrupulous than you. He gave a slave-girl to his son, and then he 
	said, 'Do not go near her, for I have seen her leg uncovered.' &quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A master can have sex with the 
	slave-girl of his male or female slave…(Malik’s Muwatta 29.17.51) </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Malik’s Muwatta:Book 29, Number 
	29.17.51: Yahya related to me from Malik from Nafi that Abdullah ibn Umar 
	said, &quot;If a man gives his slave permission to marry, the divorce is in the 
	hand of the slave, and nobody else has any power over his divorce. Nothing 
	is held against a man who takes the slave-girl of his male slave or the 
	slave-girl of his female-slave.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Slave-girls are like fields if you 
	wish then water it by ejaculating inside them or leave it thirsty i.e. 
	coitus interruption with slave-girls is optional…(Malik’s Muwatta 29.32.99)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Malik’s Muwatta: Book 29, Number 
	29.32.99: Yahya related to me from Malik from Damra ibn Said al-Mazini from 
	al-Hajjaj ibn Amr ibn Ghaziya that he was sitting with Zayd ibn Thabit when 
	Ibn Fahd came to him. He was from the Yemen. He said, &quot;Abu Said! I have 
	slave-girls. None of the wives in my keep are more pleasing to me than them, 
	and not all of them please me so much that I want a child by them, shall I 
	then practise coitus interruptus?&quot; Zayd ibn Thabit said, &quot;Give an opinion, 
	Hajjaj!&quot; &quot;I said, 'May Allah forgive you! We sit with you in order to learn 
	from you!' He said, 'Give an opinion! 'I said, 'She is your field, if you 
	wish, water it, and if you wish, leave it thirsty. I heard that from Zayd.' 
	Zayd said, 'He has spoken the truth.' &quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is possible to share slave-woman 
	for sexual purposes. Thus, a father can have sex with his son’s or even 
	grandson’s slave-women; a son can borrow his father’s or mother’s or even 
	his wives slave women for unlimited sex. Here are few excerpts from HEDAYA 
	(reference 11), the most authentic commentary on Islamic Laws that even the 
	lawyers consult. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No punishment for having sex with 
	the female slaves of a son or a grandson ---(ref: 11: page 183) Nor that 
	with the female slave of a son or a grandson.—PUNISHMENT is not incurred for 
	a man having carnal connexion with the female slave of his son, or of his 
	grandson, although he should acknowledge his consciousness of such female 
	slave having unlawful to him, for in this case the error is by effect, since 
	it proceeds from an argument founded upon the words of the prophet, who said 
	to one with whom he was conversing, “THOU AND THINE are thy FATHER’S ;”-- 
	and the grandfather is subject to the same rule with the father, as he is 
	also a parent. The parentage also of the child begotten in such carnal 
	conjunction is established in the father aforesaid, who remains responsible 
	to his son for the value of the female slave. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">‘Or of a father, mother, or wife 
	(where misconception is pleaded)—If a person have carnal connexion with the 
	female slave of his father, or his mother, or his wife, and plead his 
	conception that such slave was lawful to him, he does not incur punishment; 
	neither is the accuser liable to punishment—( but if he should acknowledge 
	his consciousness of the illegality, punishment is to be inflicted upon 
	him,--and the same rule obtains where a slave has connexion with the 
	bondmaid of his master):--because between these there a community of 
	interests in the acquisition of profit; and hence the man who commits the 
	act may in those cases have conceived, with respect to the enjoyment, that 
	this species of usufruct is also lawful to him,--wherefore error by 
	misconception is applicable to him; but nevertheless this is accrual 
	whoredom, for which reason punishment is not incurred by the accuser. The 
	law is the same (according to the Zahir Rawayet), if the female slave, in 
	either of these cases, were to plead her supposing that the act was lawful, 
	without any such plea on the part of the man,--because the carnal 
	conjunction of a man and a woman being one act, it follows that a plea of 
	supposed legality, made by either party, establishes error with respect to 
	both and hence the punishment of both is abrogated.’ </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is any one interested in looking at 
	the private parts of a woman? Of course, most men would like to do just 
	this, albeit secretly. That is why we have ‘Playboy’, ‘Penthouse’, 
	‘Ralph,’…….. etc. magazines. Looking at the glossy pages of these magazines 
	with pictures of naked woman is a great fun that most men will indulge in 
	but very few men (Muslim) will dare to admit. The bad news for these men is 
	that looking at a woman (not related to him) below the level of her naval is 
	absolutely forbidden in Islam. Forget about touching her. It is a kabirah 
	gunaah (absolute sin.) One cannot even look at the naked hands of a woman. 
	This is the height of morality in Islam. Most Islamists cannot wait to 
	announce to the world the great respect they have for women by citing these 
	absurd, silly practices. We would accept this custom as a practice of great 
	morality had it been applied to all women regardless of her social status. 
	Nope. Believe it or not, it does not apply all to women. If you are 
	unfortunate enough to be a slave-woman then you become an object of display 
	of flesh. Islam allows a man to look at every part of a slave (or a captive) 
	woman including her, breast, vagina, clitoris, anus—every part of her 
	pudenda. Unbelievable, you say. Read the following Sha’ria law on the 
	inspection of a slave-woman for sexual purposes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Slave woman—you can look at 
	pudenda---(ref. 11, p.599) ‘A man may view his wife or his slave in any 
	part.—IT is lawful for a man to look at his slave girl in any part, provided 
	he be not related him within the prohibited degrees; and also at his wife in 
	any part, even in the pudenda, if he pleases; because the Prophet said, 
	“shut your eyes from all excepting your wives and female slaves.” 
	Nevertheless, it is most becoming that a husband and wife should neither of 
	them look at the genital parts of the other, as the Prophet gas said, “when 
	ye copulate with women of your own tribe, you must conceal as much s 
	possible; and be not then naked, as that savours too much of the custom of 
	asses.”’ </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although the above provision 
	recommends a man to show restraints while copulating, nothing can prevent 
	him from indulging in all sorts of fetish/sadomasochism with a slave woman, 
	if he wishes so. Since beating of women is a permitted in the Qur’an (see 
	Qur’an verse 4:34), therefore, sadomasochistic method of sexual 
	gratification is absolutely possible in an Islamic way. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is noteworthy that many Islamists 
	often hide the truth about the extreme tyranny of sexual slavery under Islam 
	by saying that one can marry a slave woman. On the surface, this looks fair 
	enough. But when we dig deeper, we find the naked truth. The truth is a 
	Muslim man cannot marry his own slave-woman. He can only marry a slave woman 
	that belongs to another person. He cannot purchase a slave woman and marry 
	her. It is forbidden. However, he is allowed to have unlimited sex with her 
	(the woman bought as a sex slave). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One can’t marry one’s own slave but 
	one can have sex with her---(ibid, p.317) The Legal Disabilities to Marriage 
	There are nine prohibitions to marriage namely:- ………………………………………… 8. A woman 
	is prohibited by reason of property. For example, it is not lawful for a man 
	to marry his own slave, or a woman her bondsman. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Excerpts from ‘Root of 
	Terrorism—Islamic Style’ </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Muslim soldiers were hungry for 
	sex and Muhammad allowed them to rape the B. Mustaliq women captives. Here 
	is a Hadith from Sahih Bukhari: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Volume 5, Book 59, Number 459: 
	Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: I entered the Mosque and saw Abu Said Al-Khudri and 
	sat beside him and asked him about Al-Azl (i.e., coitus interruptus). Abu 
	Said said, &quot;We went out with Allah's Apostle for the Ghazwa of Banu Al-Mustaliq 
	and we received captives from among the Arab captives and we desired women 
	and celibacy became hard on us and we loved to do coitus interruptus. So 
	when we intended to do coitus interrupt us, we said, 'How can we do coitus 
	interruptus before asking Allah's Apostle who is present among us?&quot; We asked 
	(him) about it and he said, 'It is better for you not to do so, for if any 
	soul (till the Day of Resurrection) is predestined to exist, it will exist.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After having sex (rape) with his 
	captive-girl, Said al-Khudri took this young girl to the nearest slave 
	market for a quick sale. Here is the continuation of the above story, as 
	told by al-Waqidi (vol.i, p.413) and excerpted by Rodinson: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“A Jew said to me: ‘Abu Said, no 
	doubt you want to sell her as she has in her belly a baby by you.’ I said: 
	‘No; I used the ‘azl.’ To which he replied [sarcastically]: ‘Then it was 
	lesser child-murder!’ When I repeated this story to the Prophet he said: 
	‘The Jews lie. The Jews lie.’” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this connection it is worthwhile 
	to mention the Sharia Law (Islamic Law) on captive women and children:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shafi Law o9.13 Where a child or a 
	woman is taken captive, they become slaves by the fact that of capture, and 
	the woman’s previous marriage is immediately annulled. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">…………………………………………………………………….. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhammad appointed Abu Bakr as the 
	leader of this raiding party. When Abu Bakr arrived at Wadi al-Qura, he 
	ordered his troop to rest there; then they prayed. After prayer, Abu Bakr 
	made a raid on B. Fazarah. The Muslims killed a number of B. Fazarah people 
	and captured a number of their women and children. Among them was Umm Qirfa, 
	a very old lady, wearing a worn-out piece of leather coat. With her was her 
	young daughter, the fairest of the Arabs. Abu Bakr gave Umm Qirfa’s pretty, 
	young and vivacious daughter to the Jihadist Salamah b. al-Akwa who had 
	captured her as a booty or sex-slave. After Salamah b. al-Akwa returned to 
	Medina and met Muhammad at the market place, he (Muhammad) asked Salamah to 
	give this pretty young lass to him. Salamah told Muhammad that he liked her 
	but had not had sex with her yet. Then he offered her to Muhammad. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Quoting Salamah, Tabari writes: 
	‘When I returned to Medina, the messenger of God met me in the market and 
	said, “Salamah—how excellent the father who begot you!—give me the woman.” I 
	said, “Messenger of God, I like her, by God, and I have not uncovered her 
	garment.” He said nothing to me until the next day, when he met me in the 
	market and said, “Salamah—how excellent a father begot you!—give me the 
	woman.” I said: “Messenger of God, I have not touched her garment. She is 
	yours, Messenger of God.” The Messenger of God sent her to Mecca, and with 
	her he ransomed some Muslim captives who were in the hands of the 
	polytheists.’ </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a similar Hadith from Sahih 
	Muslim (Refer to: Sahih Muslim: Book 19, Hadith number 4345) </font></p>
