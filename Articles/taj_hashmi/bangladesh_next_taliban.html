  <p align="center"><font size="4">Published: February 9, 2005</font></p>

  Hashmi</a> </font><br>
  <font color="#800000">Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, Canada</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One who knows Bangladesh and Islam 
	has every reason to be surprised and worried about the recent posting by 
	Eliza Griswold in the New York Times magazine (January 23, 2005) entitled, “</font><font color="#003366"><a style="text-decoration: none" href="../../news/bangla_bhai/islamic_rev_NYTimes.html"><font color="#003366" face="Verdana">The Next Islamist Revolution?</font></a></font><font face="Verdana">” 
	I have nothing to be worried about Griswold’s abysmal ignorance about Islam 
	and Bangladesh. What is worrisome is the way the writer has demonised both 
	Islam and Bangladesh, totally ignoring the positive aspects of the third 
	largest Muslim country, which is a functional democracy, no longer 
	considered a “basket case”— the way Henry Kissinger portrayed the country in 
	1972. This cry wolf in the long run is going to benefit the evil “Islamists” 
	to the detriment of freedom and democracy. Hence this rejoinder. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This, however, does not mean that 
	all is well in Bangladesh. There are elements of truth in a Time magazine 
	story (“State of disgrace”, April 12, 2004), which has classified the 
	country as Asia’s “most dysfunctional country” for the level of violence, 
	corruption and political disharmony. Endemic violence, killing of political 
	opponents through bombs and assassins, persecution of opposition leaders and 
	supporters by using state machinery by the ruling power, systematic plunder 
	of national wealth by bank defaulters, tax evaders and rampant corruption at 
	every level are growing. The Transparency International has singled out this 
	over-populated poor country, consecutively in the last four years, as the 
	most corrupt. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since mid-2004, members of the newly 
	created Rapid Action Battalions have summarily executed around 300 known 
	killer-extortionists, euphemistically in “cross-firing”. Not only senior 
	cabinet ministers are justifying these extra-judicial killings of criminals 
	and suspects, but also the public in general (with the exceptions of handful 
	of politicians, intellectuals and human rights activists) are happy about 
	the “cleansing process”. This is ominous. People are celebrating killing as 
	the prevailing chaos, possibly heading towards anarchy, has desensitised the 
	polity. Although nothing positive is forthcoming from this state of terror 
	and lawlessness, but it is too trite a platitude to assume that only 
	“Islamist terror” is responsible for the chaos. One should not blame an 
	undefined “Islamist terror” for the prevalent violence in Bangladesh, as 
	some Western “experts” blamed Muslims for the crime of Timothy McVeigh, the 
	Oklahoma City bomber in 1995. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Griswold is not the first Western 
	writer to draw such an alarmist picture of Bangladesh. In April 2002, Bertil 
	Lintner wrote a similar sensational piece in the Far Eastern Economic Review 
	and the Wall Street Journal, that an Islamist revolution was taking place in 
	the hills of this over-populated country. Fortunately for Bangladesh, the 
	then US ambassador Mary Anne Peters registering her anger at the FEER and 
	WSJ for publishing such biased articles on “a liberal Muslim nation” 
	demanded an investigation to find out the motive behind the story. Philip 
	Bowring, former editor of the FEER, also came forward to criticise the 
	Western “Islam-bashers”, including Dow Jones, who owns the periodical. 
	Bangladeshis in general condemned Lintner, as they are now condemning 
	Griswold for good reasons. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, what is surprising that 
	Sheikh Hasina, the leader of the opposition in the parliament belonging to 
	the Awami League, not only favours such alarmist stories but she has been 
	persistently portraying the present coalition government of Prime Minister 
	Khaleda Zia as “pro-Taliban”, “Pro-Pakistan” and “anti-Bangladesh”. The 
	ruling coalition also vilifies Hasina and her party as “Pro-Indian” and 
	“enemies of Islam”. It is noteworthy that while Hasina was the Prime 
	Minister during President Clinton’s visit to Bangladesh in March 2000, her 
	government warned Clinton about the “impending threat” of terrorist attacks 
	on Clinton by Islamic militants. It is interesting that on the eve of the 
	parliamentary elections in Bangladesh in October 2001, not long after the 
	Nine-Eleven, posters on city walls in Dhaka emerged with images of Bin Laden 
	and Khaleda Zia, portraying them as “friends”. Since losing the elections of 
	2001, Hasina has been projecting the government as illegitimate and the two 
	Jamaat-i-Islami cabinet ministers as Taliban agents. One wonders if Griswold 
	met only avid Awami supporters while preparing the factually wrong and 
	analytically bizarre article on Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An appraisal of political Islam in 
	Bangladesh requires an understanding of the socio-economic and cultural 
	aspects of the polity. The separation of East Pakistan in 1971 from 
	Islam-oriented Pakistan in the name of Bengali nationalism apparently 
	signalled the departure of “political Islam” in Bangladesh. Soon after its 
	emergence, Bangladesh adopted the four-pronged state ideology of 
	nationalism, democracy, socialism and secularism. However, soon Islam 
	re-emerged as an important factor in the country, both socially and 
	politically. Since the overthrow of the first civilian government by a 
	military coup d'etat in August 1975, Islam-oriented state ideology replaced 
	“secularism” and “socialism”. Not long after his ascendancy as the new ruler 
	in November 1975, General Ziaur Rahman (Zia) replaced the outwardly secular 
	“Bengali nationalism” propounded by its founding father, Sheikh Mujibur 
	Rahman (Mujib), with “Bangladeshi nationalism”. One may argue that 
	“Bangladeshi” is inclusive of the different non-Bengali minorities— 
	nevertheless the term highlights the Muslim identity of the country, 
	differentiating its Muslim majority Bengalis from the Hindu Bengalis in 
	India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems, after the failure of the 
	“socialist-secular-Bengali-nationalist” Mujib government, his military 
	successors, Zia (1975-1981) and Ershad (1982-1990), realized the importance 
	of “political Islam” to legitimize their rule. Hence the rapid Islamization 
	of the polity. This is not typical to Bangladesh. Egypt, Algeria and 
	Pakistan under Bhutto, for example, which also went through “socialist” and 
	“secular” phases of their history turned to “political Islam” under their 
	successors. The post-Mujib oligarchs, very similar to their 
	post-Nasser-Boumediene-Bhutto counterparts, hardly realized that by 
	espousing “political Islam” they created their Frankenstein’s monsters.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Bangladesh is the third 
	largest Muslim country in the world (after Indonesia and Pakistan), it is 
	only natural to assume that Islam will play an important role in moulding 
	its politics and culture while around 90 per cent of the population are 
	Muslims—most importantly, representing one of the poorest, least literate 
	and most backward sections of the world population. If mass poverty, and 
	illiteracy have any positive correlation with Islamic resurgence, then 
	Bangladesh has to be a fertile breeding ground of what is wrongly defined as 
	“Islamic fundamentalism”. However, despite its poverty, backwardness and the 
	preponderance of Islamic ethos in the main streams of its politics and 
	culture, Bangladesh is not just another Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia or 
	even Pakistan. Despite having several Islamic groups — some militant but 
	most pacifist/devotional —the vast majority of Bangladeshi Muslims are least 
	likely to become militant Islamists in the foreseeable future. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, the spate of violence in 
	the country against religious and ethnic minorities and political rivals—and 
	of late, against the Ahmadiyya Muslim minority sect—is very disturbing. Bomb 
	attacks on political rallies, movie theatres, cultural shows besides the 
	public and secret killing of political rivals in the last five years have 
	taken hundreds of lives and maimed many. Although the attacks on the tiny 
	Ahmadiyya community solely by the Islami zealots (singling out the victims 
	as “non-Muslim” heretics) are proto-fascist by nature, we are not sure if 
	certain Islamic fanatics are also behind the other acts of terror, rape and 
	arson. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, what Eliza Griswold 
	has written about the “Islamist terror” in Bangladesh is grossly 
	exaggerated, inaccurate, confusing and misleading. She has no idea about the 
	similarities and differences between various Islamic groups and their 
	leaders, the “great” and “little” traditions of Islam in the region and the 
	difference between the mass/popular perceptions and the reality. She is too 
	naïve to believe that rural Muslim women wear “makeshift burka” or shroud to 
	cover their body, because of an Islamist militant, called Bangla Bhai, in 
	parts of north-western Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">She again tells us about the 
	strength and influence of Bangla Bhai, the main leader of a vigilante group 
	of “Awakened Muslim Masses of Bangladesh”. According to her finding, Bangla 
	Bhai with “probably 10,000 followers” wanted to try “an Islamist revolution 
	in several provinces of Bangladesh” last spring. She also thinks that this 
	fanatic vigilante group “seemed to have enough lightly armed adherents to 
	make its rule stick.” Ironically for Griswold, the day before her article 
	came out in the New York Times magazine, three Bangla Bhai cadres were 
	brutally killed by local villagers in retaliation of killing of an Awami 
	League leader on January 22nd. Bangla Bhai men were simply chased out by 
	villagers and most of them are still absconding while the police arrested 
	65. It is beyond any stretch of the imagination that Bangla Bhai is “filling 
	the power vacuum” while the government is “far away in Dhaka [less than 150 
	miles] and is … divided on precisely this question of how much Islam and 
	politics should mix”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Griswold is simply unaware of the 
	fact that Bangla Bhai, who possibly went to Afghanistan during the heydays 
	of the Taliban, is being used by some local godfathers belonging to the 
	ruling party to decimate the rising menace of some clandestine “Maoist” 
	communist groups. One of the godfathers, an erstwhile “Maoist” and now a 
	ruling party leader, has been using the armed cadres of Bangla Bhai, who 
	have killed more than 15 “Maoists” and maimed many since last spring. In 
	short, what is going on in some parts of northwestern Bangladesh does not 
	bear any semblance of an Islamic revolution but looks like gang warfare for 
	dominance and extortion, common in many unruly pockets in the Third World.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Depending on laymen and unreliable 
	sources, she tells us that Bangladesh “has become a haven” for jihadis in 
	the wake of the Nine-Eleven and that there are Taliban training camps in the 
	Chittagong hills run by madrassa (Islamic school) teachers and Afghan 
	trained mujahedeen, surprisingly unnoticed by anyone in this over-populated 
	country. She is even unaware of the fundamental differences and animosity 
	between the Jamaat-i-Islami and the Deobandi “Wahhabi” mentors of the 
	Taliban. She also narrates the absurd story about the “attempted murder” of 
	poet Shamsur Rahman by two Harkat-ul-Jihad-ul-Islami (a pro-Taliban group) 
	members in 1999. An attempted burglary by two men, over-powered by the 
	unarmed wife and daughter-in-law of the elderly poet, somehow got wide 
	publicity as a Taliban attack on the poet. This, however, does not mean that 
	the so-called “Islamists” are not responsible for the recent killing of 
	Bengali intellectuals and politicians. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having said this, I am thankful to 
	Griswold, at least for projecting Bangladesh to draw global attention to the 
	anarchic situation in the country. With a little bit of restrain and no cry 
	wolf sensationalizing one should hit at the crux of the problem, the growing 
	Islamic militancy everywhere, including Bangladesh. In this age of 
	Globalization, everything is globalized, including terror. Unless the donors 
	and others having influence on Bangladesh exert pressure on the government 
	and opposition parties to establish the rule of law, and most importantly, 
	equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities, including modern 
	education, the country would head towards anarchy from the state of chaos. 
	It is frightening that even the Prime Minister has no control over local 
	godfathers and warlords who protect and promote “Islamist” thugs like the 
	Bangla Bhai. Although the vast majority of Bengali Muslims do not believe in 
	theocracy and terror, unless the lower middle classes and the poor get a 
	sense of belonging to the state, which so far is only looking after the 
	interests of the rich and powerful, the most corrupt elements in Bangladesh, 
	extremism with a tinge of fascism (both secular and religious) would 
	continue to dog the polity. We have lessons to learn from the rise of 
	fascism in Europe in this regard.</font></p>
