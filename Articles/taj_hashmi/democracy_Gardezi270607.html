	<p>Dear All: </p>
	<p align="justify">I am sharing this well-written,analytical and 
	thought-provoking article by Professor Hassan Gardezi (teaches in Ontario, 
	Canada) with you. This appraisal of military intervention in politics in 
	Pakistan is very relevant to every Bangladeshi concerned with the 
	restoration of democracy. We have lessons to learn from the horrible 
	experience of military rule / intervention / Dadagiri in Pakistan and 
	Bangladesh. I like Gardezi's pin-pointing the specious arguments how the 
	devil (military) justifies military takeover by blaming everyone but the 
	military. Bangladeshis, who seem to be happy with the present 
	extra-constitutional regime for its good work with regard to arresting 
	corrupt politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats ( so far, all civilians) 
	should NOT be too complacent with the state of affairs in their country to 
	do anything about overthrowing the over-ambitious generals, who are just 
	waiting in the green room. Happy reading, </p>

	<p align="center">26 June, 2007 Countercurrents.org </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I started with the biggest domestic 
	challenge: having to steer the ship of the state out of troubled waters 
	before it sank. ... Things are moving well now domestically despite external 
	constraints being imposed on me by the West in its demand for &quot;democracy.&quot; - 
	Musharraf </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Gen. Pervez Musharraf’s memoir, 
	In the Line of Fire appeared last year it was perhaps dismissed too quickly 
	by progressive readers and commentators as a military ruler's attempt at 
	self promotion.1 Yet, as Pakistan is about to celebrates its 60th 
	anniversary, once again under the rule of a military man, it is worthwhile 
	to revisit his book and try specifically to figure out who this man is, how 
	he rose to power, how his mind works as a military politician, and how does 
	his rule link up with previous military regimes in shaping the kind of 
	political system and the civil society we have in Pakistan today. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Personal Background</b> </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After introducing the reader to an 
	exciting episode of attempt on his life in the Epilogue, Musharraf proceeds 
	to describe his early life in the first five chapters of the book. The 
	picture that emerges is that of a youngster growing up in Karachi in the 
	environment of a typical well off family belonging to what sociologist Alavi 
	has described as the educated Muslim &quot;salariat class&quot;of the subcontinent, a 
	large segment of which migrated from India to Pakistan at the time of 
	partition to take advantage of opportunities opened up in the new country, 
	particularly in the state bureaucracy.2 Musharraf’s father was educated at 
	the famous Aligargh Muslim University and was married to the daughter of a 
	Khan Bahadur, the honorary title conferred by the colonial government on 
	some prominent and loyal members of India’s Muslim gentry. So one has to be 
	a bit skeptical when he reminds his readers that &quot;I was more of a 
	commoner...&quot; (pp. 79-80). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a child Musharraf was sent to the 
	old and well-regarded St. Patrick’s School of Karachi run by Catholic 
	missionaries and also spent some time in Turkey where his father was posted 
	as an accountant in the Pakistan Embassy in Ankara. For college education he 
	was sent to another private institution, the Forman Christian (FC) College, 
	in Lahore run by American missionaries, which attracted &quot;anglicized&quot; and 
	&quot;modern&quot; students according to Musharraf. This college, we are told, is one 
	of the three in Lahore that &quot;have produced many leaders for Pakistan in 
	various fields because they keep their students grounded in native culture 
	and history, quite unlike those boys who went to foreign universities, which 
	have mostly produced political leaders disconnected from Pakistan’s culture 
	and history, leaders who have damaged the country not only with their 
	corruption but also with their alien political and economic philosophies.&quot; 
	(pp. 31-32) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Aside from the rather contentious 
	logic of the above sentence, it is hard to imagine how much grounding young 
	Musharraf had in Pakistan’s culture and history as he just &quot;managed to get 
	through&quot; two years of education at FC College. All told there is nothing 
	academically noteworthy in Musharraf’s educational background and he is 
	frank enough to admit that: &quot;If from all this, you have concluded that I was 
	not intensely focused on my studies, you would not be far wrong.&quot; (P.34)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1961, at the age of 18 Musharraf 
	entered the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA). where he did well as a cadet, 
	particularly in mastering the demanding routines of physical training. Soon 
	after graduating from the PMA, he saw action in the 1965 war with India. As 
	a young officer Musarraf proved his mettle on the front lines and received 
	an award for gallantry. In this war, he writes, &quot;Pakistan gave India a 
	fright and a bloody nose,&quot; a common perception among patriotic Pakistanis.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Politician Bashing </font></b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not much is said about the 1971 lost 
	war with India, but in chapter 7 Musharraf for the first time offers his 
	views on &quot;political developments in Pakistan.&quot; These relate to the secession 
	of East Pakistan for which most of the blame is laid on the shoulders of 
	&quot;wily Bhutto.&quot; Other reasons mentioned for the dismemberment of Pakistan in 
	1971 include, India’s invasion, &quot; with overt help&quot; of the Soviet Union, lack 
	of intervention on behalf of Pakistan by the US &quot;our longtime ally,&quot; and 
	&quot;incompetence&quot; of the ruling generals of the time (Yahya Khan and his 
	associates). As for Musharraf himself he was all ready in West Pakistan with 
	his commando company &quot;to seize a bridge about twenty miles (thirty-two 
	kilometers) inside the enemy territory,&quot; when to his dismay cease-fire was 
	declared on December 17. (p.54) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Musharraf returns to Zulfiqar Ali 
	Bhutto’s follies in the next chapter. He admits to having &quot;admired&quot; the man 
	once but changed his mind when told by his civil servant brother that 
	&quot;Bhutto was no good and would ruin the country.&quot; (p.58) In what appears to 
	be Bhutto-mania in reverse, Musharraf blames the late prime minister for a 
	long list of wrongdoings. He sought ‘raw power&quot; by not reverting to the 1956 
	constitution (abrogated with the imposition of 1958 martial law) and instead 
	had a new constitution enacted (1973) which curtailed the authority of the 
	president to fire the prime minister; he &quot;ravaged&quot; the economy by &quot;mindless 
	nationalization;&quot; he &quot;destroyed&quot; the country’s institutions &quot;under his brand 
	of so-called Islamic socialism;&quot; and he acted like a &quot;despotic dictator&quot; and 
	was &quot;really a fascist.&quot; In addition Bhutto is denounced for throwing many of 
	his opponents in prison and &quot;being first to appease the religious right.&quot; To 
	conclude, says Musharraf, &quot;Bhutto was the worst thing that had yet happened 
	to Pakistan,&quot; and that he &quot;did more damage to the country than anyone else, 
	damage from which we have still not fully recovered.&quot; (p.58) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bhutto’s style of governance and 
	policy failures as a prime minister have been extensively critiqued by 
	astute political analysts. Musharraf’s intense dislike of the man, once a 
	popular politician, has more to do with his obsession with discrediting 
	civilian political leaders of the country en-block. Bhutto comes in for 
	special rebuke for putting the army establishment in its place, although he 
	did refurbish a very much discredited military very quickly after 
	its1971debacle. Bhutto &quot;is said to have adopted a mocking, belittling 
	attitude toward his own appointee as army chief, Gen. Zia ul-Haq,&quot; complains 
	Musharraf. (p.60) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Gen. Zia ul-Haq’s coup of 1977 and 
	his decade long repressive regime is also given some coverage, but unlike 
	the downright and copious condemnation of Bhutto not much is said about the 
	far reaching social and political consequences of Zia dictatorship. A few 
	remarks do occur about his enforcement of the &quot;terrible&quot; punishment of 
	lashings, his alliance with the &quot;religious lobby&quot; and banning of &quot;music and 
	entertainment&quot; from official functions. But little is said about his 
	enduring legacy of victimization of women and minorities through the 
	ordination of so called sharia laws and above all his major contribution to 
	the entrenchment of military’s hegemonic role in the affairs of Pakistani 
	state and society. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Corruption and Militarization</b>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The militarization of the state of 
	Pakistan began in eanest when Gen. (later Field Marshall) Ayub Khan took 
	over in 1958, &quot;as a last bid to save the country,&quot; from politicians, such as 
	had survived the encroachment of bureaucrats into high government offices 
	during the first decade of independence.3 The process was interrupted by the 
	events of 1970-71 and election of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto as the prime minister 
	of territorially diminished Pakistan, but revived again diligently when 
	military rule was reestablished by Gen. Zia who ousted Bhutto in 1977. Zia 
	proceeded not only to tighten the military’s grip on state power, it was 
	also under his long rule that the military made deep inroads into the 
	spheres of national politics and civil administration, as well as private 
	industry and commerce. Many serving and retired military officers were 
	inducted into the state bureaucracy and others appointed heads of public 
	corporations, administrators of institutions of higher education and board 
	members of private enterprises. The military establishment also began to 
	enter directly into business and production on a massive scale.4 </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Given this heavy influx of army’s 
	officer crops into the political, administrative and economic spheres of 
	society, it is no longer realistic to conceive of Pakistan’s military 
	establishment functioning by norms of conduct unsullied by pervasive 
	corruptions that every coup maker from Gen. Ayub Khan to Gen. Pervez 
	Musharraf has attributed to &quot;politicians&quot;and other civilian functionaries.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nevertheless, Musharraf believes 
	that: &quot;The pattern in my country has been repetitive: elected officials have 
	been vulnerable to corruption and create conditions that lead to an army 
	takeover, ...&quot; (p.71). While making this observation he is certainly not 
	speaking from the detached distance of his army command posts. His own 
	narrative that follows is a chronicle of how both the military and civilian 
	elite that rule Pakistan interact in the same social and political milieu. 
	They communicate with each other officially and unofficially, share their 
	political agendas, compete for political power, discuss business, socialize 
	at the wedding parties of their offspring, harbor similar personal grudges 
	and professional rivalries, and also gossip about each other through their 
	spouses. The following excerpts indicate how readily the army GHQ becomes 
	the hub of political activity drawing the civil and military elite together 
	whenever conditions are ripe for a regime change: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;In 1995 I was promoted to 
	lieutenant general and posted to Mangla to command the elite strike corps of 
	the Pakistan Army. As a corps commander I was automatically part of army’s 
	highest decision-making body - the Corps Commanders’ Conference. I saw then 
	how national personalities from all professions - including opposition 
	politicians - regularly visited the army chief to encourage him to oppose 
	the sitting government. I also came to know of many peoples’ political 
	agendas. Whenever a government was performing poorly (unfortunately that was 
	the norm in the &quot;democratic&quot; decade of the 1990s) or was in political 
	trouble, all roads led to the army GHQ.&quot; (p.77) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Again we read on another page:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It is not unusual in Pakistan for 
	the general public and the intelligentsia to approach the army chief and ask 
	him to save the nation. In all crises, everyone sees Pakistan’s army as the 
	country’s savior. Whenever governments have malfunctioned (as has frequently 
	occurred), whenever there has been a tussle between the president and the 
	prime minister (especially during the 1990s) all roads lead to the general 
	headquarters of the army. The army chief was regularly expected to put 
	pressure on the prime minister to perform - to avoid corruption, nepotism, 
	and sometimes downright criminality. The army chief was also dragged in to 
	mediate all disputes between the president and the prime minister.&quot; (p. 137)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These are supposedly insider 
	observations which the author makes in particular reference to what he calls 
	the &quot;dreadful decade&quot; of &quot;sham democracy,&quot; the post-Zia interregnum of 
	civilian rule between November 1988 and October 1999. During this period 
	Benazir Bhutto of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Nawaz Sharif of the 
	Muslim League (MLN) each served twice alternately as elected prime minister, 
	and each was ousted twice by presidential decree or intervention by the army 
	chief without being able to complete their full terms of office. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Soldiering Into Politics</b>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What Musharraf does not acknowledge 
	here is that much more was going on behind the scenes during this period 
	besides the regular visits to the army GHQ by national personalities and 
	opposition politicians. The military high command, greatly enhanced in its 
	political and economic clout, was itself keeping the situation under close 
	watch while constantly interfering with the post-Zia democratic transition 
	in order to make sure that no elected government, not the least one led by 
	Bhutto’s PPP, will emerge strong enough to challenge the military’s newfound 
	sphere of power and privilege or undo its policies put in place for internal 
	governance and external relations. Not only sitting governments were being 
	deposed, the army’s most insidious intelligence service known as ISI 
	(Inter-Services Intelligence) was actively manipulating election outcomes, 
	engineering alliances among political factions and supporting individual 
	candidates acceptable to the army GHQ. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">General Zia’s unmitigated military 
	rule had left the 1973 parliamentary constitution deformed beyond 
	recognition through numerous amendments, especially the 8th one which gave 
	the president power to dismiss the prime minister and dissolve the 
	parliament. The army had been thoroughly politicized and its defacto power 
	over the affairs of the state vastly increased. In Musharraf’s own words:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;During these eleven years, every 
	army chief - there were four of them - eventually clashed with the prime 
	minister. The head of the government invariably got on the wrong side of the 
	president and the army chief. Advice to Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto fell 
	on deaf ears, leading every time to confrontation.&quot; (p. 78) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In other words by 1990s the chiefs 
	of Pakistan army had become accustomed to counseling the elected prime 
	ministers and requiring compliance to their advice, resistance to which 
	brought confrontations. Although this mode of intervention by the army chief 
	in the governance of the country is not sanctioned by the constitution, even 
	after all the amendments introduced into it since 1977, it did put the 
	elected prime ministers on the defensive and drove them to function under 
	constant fear of imminent reversion to military rule. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Nawaz Sharif was elected prime 
	minister for the second time in 1997 he had, in Musharraf’s words, &quot;a brute 
	two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.&quot; (p.162) He first used this 
	majority to rescind Gen. Zia’s 8th amendment to the constitution which had 
	given the president power to dismiss the prime minister and dissolve the 
	parliament. In Musharraf’s view this was a bad move because it &quot; removed the 
	safety valve that could get rid of corrupt and inapt governments without the 
	intervention of the army.&quot; (p. 85) Secondly, Nawaz Sharif is said to have 
	forced the incumbent army chief of staff, Gen. Jahangir Karamat’s 
	resignation, allegedly for making a speech at the Naval Staff College 
	criticizing the government and suggesting the establishment of a national 
	security council. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Musharraf writes that he was 
	&quot;shocked&quot; at the &quot;meek manner&quot; in which the army chief tendered his 
	resignation. It also &quot;caused great resentment in the army, as soldiers and 
	officers alike felt humiliated.&quot; (p. 84) But much more intriguing is the 
	less than transparent manner in which Musharraf himself was appointed to 
	replace Gen. Karamat as the army chief. He describes this episode with much 
	relish and without any qualms, the gist of which follows. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">The Beginning of the End </font>
	</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the night of October 7, 1998 
	while watching TV and unaware of Gen. Karamat’s resignation, Musharraf 
	received a surprise telephone call at his residence in Mangla that Nawaz 
	Sharif wished to see him and that he should come to Islamabad immediately 
	without letting Gen. Karamat know anything about his visit. He &quot;sensed that 
	there was something abnormal afoot,&quot; but took off for Islamabad with his 
	military police escort. As his car was entering Islamabad he received 
	another call from an ISI brigadier and a friend who congratulated him and 
	told him that Gen Karamat had resigned and &quot;you are being made chief.&quot; On 
	hearing this news, says Musharraf, his &quot;mind raced back&quot; to several corps 
	commanders’ meetings at the GHQ a few months ago when a tussle was going on 
	between prime minister Nawaz Sharif and president Farooq Lagharai, and the 
	chief of the army had to decide what action to take in the matter. He 
	recalled how he had stood up for democracy and favored the prime minister 
	who was now in the position of appointing the army chief of staff. Another 
	lieutenant general, Ali Kuli Khan, who was higher in the seniority list, 
	strongly favored the president, a friend of his, who was then empowered to 
	appoint the army chief of staff. Musharraf also remembered at this point how 
	&quot;color had drained from Lieutenant General Ali Kuli’s face&quot; when he learned 
	that his friend, the president, had lost his power to appoint the army chief 
	with the annulment of the 8th amendment to the constitution and how a 
	desperate Ali Kuli had called for the imposition of martial law in the 
	country, a proposal rejected by the army chief Gen. Karamat. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These thoughts still in his mind 
	Musharraf entered the office of the prime minister in Islamabad and found 
	him &quot;sitting on a sofa and smiling a victorious smile.&quot; (p.84) His entry was 
	followed by a warm meeting between the two as Nawaz Sharf appointed him the 
	new army chief. After this exciting meeting, says Musharraf, he &quot;saluted the 
	prime minister and left.&quot; First he called on Gen. Karamat at the Army House 
	to express his regrets at his resignation, and then called his wife and 
	parents to convey the good news of his promotion as army chief which they 
	were thrilled to hear. His only disappointment was that Lt. Gen. Ali Kuli 
	Khan announced his retirement from the army forthwith, rather than being 
	&quot;glad that his friend was appointed chief.&quot; To all those in the army who 
	were full of resentment over the forced resignation of Gen. Karamat, he 
	offered the pragmatic advice &quot;to stop brooding and ... get on with the job.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whatever this episode means 
	personally to Musharraf, it certainly does not appear to be a normal 
	procedure for the appointment of an army chief by an executive head of the 
	state. Nawaz Sharif in this case sets out to appoint the chief of his armed 
	forces in his capacity as prime minister. Normally, one would think, it 
	should be a matter of picking out the senior most military officer for the 
	job, in consultation with the outgoing chief of the army, and issuing a 
	government notification to that affect. But what we find is that the 
	incumbent army chief has been &quot;forced&quot; to resign, in hushed up conditions, 
	because of a speech he made offering &quot;suggestions about how to improve the 
	governance of the country,&quot; which put him on the wrong side of the prime 
	minister. The process of his replacement that follows turns out to be even 
	more enigmatic. The secretive phone calls, the late night meeting, the 
	victorious smile on the face of Nawaz Sharif, are all suggestive of a 
	devious political game being played rather than a transparent executive 
	decision being made. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is hard to believe that the real 
	significance of this staged act was lost on Musharraf. It is quite obvious 
	that Nawaz Sharif was trying to impress upon him that he was being chosen 
	for the job over Ali Kuli Khan as a special favor which he must return by 
	staying loyal to the prime minister and not doing anything to subvert his 
	government. In other words it was a political appointment which, of course, 
	is not unusual in Pakistan’s history. All elected civilian prime ministers 
	ever since Ayub Khan’s first military coup have tried to chose an army chief 
	who is not the most senior or best qualified among the officer corps, but 
	the one perceived to be the most pliant and obsequious in character. Nawaz 
	Sharif did the same according to his wits and his style. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, a relationship which was 
	founded on bonds of wishful personal loyalties rather than objectively 
	shared professional commitments and division of labor, soon got mired in 
	games of &quot;he loves me, he loves me not,&quot; giving rise to suspicions of 
	betrayal and perfidy. In the beginning, says Musharraf, my relationship with 
	the prime minister was &quot;perfectly good.&quot; He writes that &quot;I did my best to be 
	cooperative as army chief.&quot; But the very language used to describe such 
	cooperation betrays the fact that this army chief too was prone more to 
	intrude into matters of governing the country rather then doing his own job 
	for which he had been trained. For example, he says: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I regularly asked Nawaz Sharif how 
	the army could help to improve his sagging government.&quot; (p. 137) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I had ventured to advise him 
	several times how to improve his government.&quot; (p. 137) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;In October 1999, the nation was 
	fast headed toward economic and political collapse. Under these trying 
	circumstances, I was working to shore up the prime minister and help him 
	perform better. It is unfortunate that he distrusted my good intentions. ... 
	His misplaced perception of my loyalty, coupled with the suspicion that I 
	was planning a coup, must have led to Nawaz Sharif’s paranoia.&quot; (pp. 137-38)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Wherever the nation was headed 
	toward in October 1999, it is clear that Musharraf’s constant intrusion into 
	the sphere of prime minister’s duties was having little effect other than 
	breeding mutual distrust and suspicions. Their relations had reached a point 
	where each was afraid that the other was planning to get rid of him. Some 
	anecdotes narrated by Musharraf in retrospect on this situation make quite 
	an engaging reading: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Mrs. Ziauddin, the wife of the 
	officer who was supposed to replace me , asked another officer’s wife about 
	the deportment expected of a chief’s spouse. In the presence of the wife of 
	a major general, one of Ziauddin’s relatives asked about the difference in 
	ranks worn by a full general compared to a lieutenant general.&quot; (p. 109)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I had already conveyed an indirect 
	warning to the prime minister through several intermediaries: &quot;I am not 
	Jahangir Karamat.&quot; My predecessor had retired quietly ...&quot; (p.110) </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Slowly but surely Nawaz Sharif was 
	being fed information to make him paranoid about me by people who stood to 
	gain from my exit. He was constantly being told that I was going to remove 
	him.&quot; (p. 110) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What one can conclude from these 
	extracts is that in the absence of an established professional code of 
	conduct, working relationship between the prime minister and his army chief, 
	as well as within the army high command, were being shaped by gossip and 
	hearsay. In the end Nawaz Sharif tried to appease Musharraf by resorting to 
	the same kind of personalized approach hat he had used at the time of 
	elevating him to the position of army chief. He invited Musharraf and his 
	wife to &quot;accompany him and his wife to Mecca for pilgrimage&quot; and to have a 
	family dinner with him before departure for the holy land. At the dinner was 
	also present Nawaz Sharif’s brother Shahbaz Sharif, the chief minister of 
	Punjab province, and the event was presided over by their father, Abbaji. 
	During the dinner Abbaji is said to have made a long and uninterrupted 
	speech narrating his life experiences at the end of which he turned to 
	Musharraf and said, &quot;You are also my son, and these two sons of mine dare 
	not speak against you. If they do, they will be answerable to me.&quot; (p.113)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Musharraf writes that he was only 
	&quot;embarrassed,&quot; by all this which he thought &quot;was quite a charade.&quot; At the 
	same time he was enforcing his own code of personal loyalties within the 
	army high command. He suspected Lt. Gen. Tariq Pervez of being the source of 
	leaked information that the army chief was planning to carry out a coup. 
	Sometime after the dinner with Abbaji, the prime minister’s brother, Shahbaz, 
	came to see him and in Musharraf’s words, &quot;I told him to tell his brother 
	two things. One, I would not agree to give up my present position of chief 
	of army staff ... Two, I was recommending the retirement of the corps 
	commander in Quetta, Lieutenant General Tariq Pervez. He was ill 
	disciplined, and I suspected him of plotting against me. The problem was 
	that TP, as he was known in the army, was brother-in-law of one of Nawaz 
	Sharif’s ministers and was using his influence ...&quot; (p.112) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whatever Nawaz Sharif’s covert 
	intentions may have been in his dealings with Musharraf, in the open he was 
	ready to go to any extent to please him. When presented with papers from the 
	army chief’s office to retire PT, he simply signed them. This would appear 
	to be a gross violation of fair play and due process, the cardinal 
	principles of better governance so ardently advocated by Musharraf. If the 
	army chief was there to make the prime minister &quot;perform better,&quot; who was 
	there to check the performance of the army chief,? one wonders. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>The Kargil Crisis</b> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ironically, it was Nawaz Sharif who 
	found himself in the midst of an international crisis for not being able or 
	willing to keep his army chief’s activities under check. Musharaff writes 
	that it was the Kargil conflict which initially &quot;soured&quot; his relations with 
	the prime minister. He devotes a whole chapter in his book on this issue in 
	order to vindicate himself and shift all the blame for the Kargil crisis 
	onto Nawaz Sharif. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Kargil, a small town on the Indian 
	side of the Line of Control (LOC) is located in the frigid high mountains of 
	northern Kashmir. According to Musharraf’s narrative, in early 1999 
	&quot;Kashmiri freedom fighting mujahideen occupied the Kargil heights that the 
	Indian army had vacated for the winter.&quot; When Indian soldiers returned to 
	their posts in early summer, Musharraf had already moved several battalions 
	of troops belonging to Northern Light Infantry (NLI), a paramilitary force 
	not fully integrated in the Pakistan army, in &quot;support&quot; of the mujahideen. 
	As he puts it, &quot;Our field commanders were fully engaged in supporting them 
	in the face of growing momentum of the Indian operations.&quot; In practical 
	terms, this &quot;growing momentum of the Indian operations&quot; amounted to a 
	massive Indian air and ground attack by &quot;more than four divisions&quot; of the 
	Indian army to expel &quot;five battalions&quot; of Pakistan’s NLI troops from their 
	side of LOC. They &quot;also started crossing over and bombarding positions of 
	the Pakistan army,&quot; says Musharraf. Outnumbered and outgunned the mujahideen 
	and the supporting soldiers from Pakistan were being picked one by one by 
	the Indian fire. Nevertheless, Musharaf remained convinced that his fighters 
	will be able to repel the &quot;disproportionate&quot; Indian assault. He insists that 
	by July 4, the day cease-fire was declared, the Indians &quot;did achieve some 
	success, which I would consider insignificant. Our troops were fully 
	prepared to hold our dominating positions ahead of the watershed.&quot; (p.93)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the meantime, the world leaders 
	were getting very alarmed by this bloody flare-up which they feared could 
	lead to a nuclear war between the two South Asian rivals. There was &quot;intense 
	international pressure&quot; on Nawaz Sharif, according to Musharraf’s own 
	admission, and there was talk about Pakistan army being a &quot;rogue army.&quot; (p. 
	95) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On July 3, Nawaz Sharif flew to 
	Washington to address President Clinton’s concerns about the situation, but 
	not before asking his army chief one more time: &quot;Should we accept a 
	cease-fire and a withdrawal?&quot; Musharraf writes that his &quot; answer was the 
	same: the military situation is favourable; the political decision has to be 
	his own.&quot; (p. 97) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Washington on July 4, as one can 
	recall, President Clinton confronted Nawaz Sharif with satellite 
	surveillance pictures showing a massive buildup of Indian war machine on 
	Pakistan’s international borders and the prime minister, no less a &quot;patriot&quot; 
	than Musharraf one would assume, realized that withdrawal was the only 
	alternative to another devastating all-out war with India. He agreed to 
	cease-fire and withdrawal from the Kargil heights. But Musharraf in his book 
	protests: &quot;He went off and decided on a cease-fire. It remains a mystery to 
	me why he was in such a hurry.&quot;(p. 97) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet, Nawaz Sharif’s going off to 
	Washinton and negotiating a cease-fire was no more of a mystery than Field 
	Marshall Ayub Khan’s taking off to Tashkent to negotiate the end of 1965 war 
	with India. The problem is that in launching the Kargil operation Musharraf, 
	and a few of his commanders he had taken into confidence, had learned 
	nothing from the past mistakes. He claims that the operation he initiated 
	&quot;on the snow clad peaks and in the boulder ridden valleys of the Northern 
	Areas&quot; was &quot;a tactical marvel of military professionalism.&quot; What he does not 
	realize is that this &quot;marvel&quot; was merely a thoughtless repetition of the 
	same old and failed strategy the venerable Field Marshall had employed in 
	Kashmir in the August of 1965, touching off an all-out war with India. It 
	was the same old story of reliance on volunteer militant fighters, now 
	available ready-made in all shapes and forms of mujahideen zealots, to cross 
	the LOC in Kashmir, followed by deployment of regular troops, followed by 
	denials when the other side turned the heat on, and the whole operation 
	undertaken without a full and sober assessment of its military, political 
	and international-diplomatic consequences. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why did Musharraf not oppose the 
	cease-fire at the time it was negotiated, if he was so sure that it was a 
	bad idea, and left the &quot;political decision&quot; to the prime minister? Here is a 
	rather implausible explanation: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;As the chief of the army staff, I 
	found myself in a very difficult position. I wanted to explain the military 
	situation, to demonstrate how successful we had been and point out political 
	mishandling that had caused so much despair. But that would have been 
	disloyal, and very unsettling for the political leaders.&quot; (p. 95) </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Coming from a self-assured 
	politician-bashing general, it certainly is an odd statement. What seems 
	closer to truth is that the reckless Kargil operation, undertaken 
	secretively in disregard of its grave political and security consequences 
	for Pakistan and the region, had raised a storm of criticism in both the 
	domestic and foreign media, as is also evident from Musharraf’s own 
	complaint that: &quot;All kinds of carefully placed articles had appeared, 
	including a one page advertisement in a newspaper in the United States, 
	maligning the army and creating a divide between it and the government.&quot; 
	(p.137) Any attempt to justify what he had done would have prolonged the 
	questioning of his judgement and his competence as chief of the army. That 
	seems to be the real reason which kept him quiet in the immediate aftermath 
	of the Kargil crisis. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While writing in retrospect, from 
	his secure presidential perch, Musharraf can afford to be himself again, a 
	military general with overflowing confidence. And that is what is really 
	important for a proper assessment of what his rule, or military rule in 
	general, means for Pakistan. Quoting Richard Nixon, Musharraf says that a 
	leader must never &quot;suffer paralysis through analysis.&quot; (p. 131) This is 
	surely not a very reassuring precept coming from someone who leads a modern 
	state. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Case of Balochistan A specific 
	example of this narrow militaristic approach to complex domestic issues is 
	also encountered in Musharraf’s thinking on the current political unrest in 
	Balochistan and methods adopted by his regime to contain that unrest. He 
	writes: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest 
	province in area but smallest in population. It is also the most backward. 
	... Ninety-five percent of Balochistan is administratively a &quot;B area,&quot; where 
	the government does not exercise total authority and the local sirdar or 
	chief plays an important role. Only 5 percent is an &quot;A area,&quot; which comes 
	under the regular government. A few of the sirdars in B area have been 
	manipulating and blackmailing every Pakistani government for decades, using 
	militant mercenaries that they maintain as their local militia forces. They 
	have also kept their own tribes suppressed under their iron grip through 
	indiscriminate use of force. I have taken upon myself to convert all the B 
	areas into A areas and establish the government writ there.&quot; (p.59) </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is indeed a stark depiction of 
	a complex political and social problem. Shorn of its colonial and historical 
	accretions, the persistent Baloch demand for political autonomy and control 
	over their natural resources is simply reduced to the problem of enforcing 
	the government’s writ. And as is common knowledge, that enforcement is being 
	accomplished through a massive military and para-military operation, third 
	of its kind in Balochistan since independence and perhaps the most brutal. 
	On top of it innumerable complaints are being voiced about human rights 
	violations and &quot;disappearances.&quot; All this is bound to be counterproductive, 
	as past experiences with domestic military operations have shown. If the 
	problem was just to convert B areas into A areas, that objective could have 
	been achieved more peacefully and effectively by extending to all the people 
	of Balochistan their entitlements to full citizenship, such as adequate 
	means of livelihood, education, health care, electricity, communication and 
	transportation services, thereby raising their sense of identification with 
	the nation and the national government. Unfortunately, today there are more 
	military and paramilitary soldiers posted in Balochistan than there are 
	teachers at all levels of educational institutions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, what is happening in 
	Balochistan today is part of a continuous process of building the Pakistani 
	state into a highly centralized, unitary and authoritarian political 
	structure in which the army establishment has come to play a decisive role. 
	Such a political structure remains impervious to the basic needs of people, 
	operates in a neo-colonial framework and is inimical to pluralistic 
	democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Who Rules Pakistan?</b> </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is an interesting chapter in 
	Musharraf’s book in which the author picks up the question of why democracy 
	has &quot;eluded Pakistan since its birth in 1947.&quot; He starts out by defining 
	democracy with textbook precision as &quot;rule by the people.&quot; This is followed 
	by an undisputable observation that: &quot;What we in Pakistan have consciously 
	created instead is rule by a small elite - never democratic, often 
	autocratic, usually plutocratic, and lately kleptocratic - all working with 
	a tribal- feudal mind-set, ...&quot; (p.154) But then he makes a strategic 
	omission in his next statement: &quot;This small elite comprises feudal barons, 
	tribal warlords, and politicians of all hues.&quot; Missing conspicuously from 
	this statement are the army generals who have ruled Pakistan directly and 
	indirectly over most of its history. They could, of course, be included with 
	some justification, in any of the categories of feudal barons, warlords, or 
	politicians of all hues, but that is not what is intended. The generals are 
	said to be the monitors of good government who occasionally stage military 
	coups to &quot;save the nation.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In reality, however, the generals 
	have not only ruled Pakistan for extended periods of time, they have shown a 
	great appetite for politics and political engineering of &quot;what we in 
	Pakistan have consciously created. ...&quot; It was General Ayub Khan, who first 
	swept aside whatever the civilian politicians had accomplished in the first 
	decade of independence and started out afresh &quot;to establish political 
	institutions and stable instruments of government.&quot;5 Even before he took 
	over the reigns of government, he was obsessed with thoughts of doing 
	something with the political &quot;problem&quot; in the country. On a sleepless night 
	in October 1954, he sat up in a hotel room in London and wrote a document on 
	how the people of Pakistan shall be governed.6 The document was later 
	incorporated in the constitution of Pakistan when he took over, putting the 
	country on the road to &quot;controlled democracy&quot; and a powerful unitary state.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Each subsequent military ruler has 
	made his own contribution to enhancing the power of the central state over 
	its citizens and its constituent units. When Musharraf took over as head of 
	the state he too set himself a political agenda with two major priorities 
	laid out in his book, first, to &quot;instutionalize&quot; the army establishment’s 
	defacto role and power in conducting the affairs of the state, and secondly 
	to centralize state power in the federal government on the pattern of 
	militaristic hierarchy of control and command. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In support of his first project, he 
	starts out by asserting that there are &quot;three power brokers&quot; in Pakistan’s 
	political system, the army, the president and the prime minister, and 
	affirms that: &quot;Imposing checks and balances on the three power brokers of 
	the country was always high on my agenda.&quot; (p.170) Although the power of all 
	the three is to be checked and balanced, his argument revolves mainly on the 
	need to check the prime minister’s power in order to make him &quot;govern 
	better.&quot; Referring to the interregnum of civilian democracy between 
	1988-1999, he writes: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;It almost invariably happened that 
	the prime minister would refuse to listen, and this refusal would lead to 
	intense acrimony between him and the president or even the army chief. This 
	invariably resulted either in dissolution of the assembly by the president 
	or, once the power of the president to dissolve the Assembly was removed, 
	the danger of the imposition of martial law by the army chief.&quot; (p.170)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In order for the country to escape 
	that &quot;danger&quot;in future, Musharraf proposed and got enacted, by a simple 
	majority vote of the National Assembly, the establishment of a National 
	Security Council (NSC), on which are represented &quot; four men in uniform,&quot; the 
	three army, navy, air force chiefs and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
	Committee . The Council is to meet regularly and keep pressure on the prime 
	minister to &quot;perform,&quot; which will help &quot;sustain democracy and avoid martial 
	law.&quot; Musharraf also argues that there will be no need for the army chief to 
	remove the prime minister and take over &quot;because he has an institution 
	available to voice his concerns (and the concerns of a worried people) to 
	the prime minister and can then allow the constitution and the political 
	process to take its course.&quot; (p.171) Some consolation indeed, for the future 
	prime ministers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The reader is also assured that the 
	NSC is to be a &quot;consultative body&quot; only. However, one cannot help but note 
	that the raison d’etre behind the NSC is army’s monopoly over the coercive 
	power of the state which it has used in the past to overthrow elected 
	civilian governments, not withstanding the after-the-fact rationalizations 
	(the imminent destruction of the country, the doctrine of necessity and its 
	various versions). On the other hand, the president and the prime minister 
	derive their power and its limits from the constitution which Gen. Zia once 
	dubbed as a mere &quot;piece of paper.&quot; One can take Musharraf’s word for it, but 
	the &quot;consultative&quot; role of the NSC with four men in uniform on it can indeed 
	be quite formidable and intimidating, to say the least. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Musharraf’s second political project 
	of centralizing power in the federal state appears aspoint 2 of his seven 
	point political agenda, announced shortly after his 1999 coup, which states: 
	‘Strengthen the federation, remove interprovincial disharmony and restore 
	national cohesion. (p.149) However, there is no proposal in his book 
	specifically aimed at structural changes in the existing relations of power 
	between the center and the federating units, highly centralized as they 
	already are. What we have is a plan to &quot;devolve power to the grass roots,&quot; 
	which seeks to forge direct links between the central government and the 
	local level administrations, bypassing the provincial governments. According 
	to Musharraf, &quot;Pakistan has had a central (federal) government and large 
	regional(provincial) governments, but the local affairs have been either 
	unregulated or managed by the provincial governments.&quot; (p.172) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His Local Government Ordinance, 2000 
	creates a three tier administrative structure of elected bodies , the 
	District Council, the sub-district or tehsil Council and a multi-village 
	Union Council, each headed by a nazim or administrator. The delivery of 
	services and public goods are transferred from the provincial governments to 
	the district administrations, and direct budgetary allocations can be made 
	to the district and lower level bodies by both the central and provincial 
	governments. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It has been a usual practice for 
	Pakistan’s military rulers to fall back on projects of local level democracy 
	after overthrowing the elected national governments in order to claim 
	popular legitimacy for their rule, Yahya Khan’s short lived rule being an 
	exception. Ayub Khan crafted &quot;Basic Democracy&quot; as a truly indigenous form of 
	Pakistani democracy. Zia ul-Haq relied on the holding of party-less local 
	bodies’ elections to shore up his democratic credentials and Musharraf 
	points to his Local Government Ordinance (LGO) to project himself as a true 
	democrat. All have a record restricting the jurisdiction of provincial 
	governments, and suppressing movements of provincial autonomy with military 
	force. Ayub conducted such army opperations in Balochistan, Yahya in East 
	Bengal when it was part of Pakistan, Zia in Sindh, and now Musharraf again 
	in Balochistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While Musharraf takes much credit 
	for having introduced grass roots democracy with his LGO the implementation 
	of which he calls a &quot;silent revolution&quot; on the authority of World Bank (p. 
	151), he is also compulsively attracted to a militaristic, hierarchal power 
	structure in governing the country. He contends that Pakistan was in &quot;dire 
	need of unity of command,&quot; by which he means a &quot;single authority,&quot; not only 
	in the political system but also over above the bureaucracy and the 
	military. (p. 177) Interestingly enough he considers his military uniform as 
	the symbol of that unity of command and single authority. He admits quite 
	candidly that he had given &quot;verbal commitment to retire from the army and 
	remove my uniform by December 2004,&quot; but realizing the gravity of the 
	domestic and international situation, particularly &quot;the war against 
	terror,&quot;he came to realize that &quot;removing my uniform would dilute my 
	authority and command at a time when both were required most.&quot; (pp. 176-177) 
	Referring to the concerns abroad about military’s involvement in politics, 
	he says: &quot;I am still struggling to convince the West that Pakistan is more 
	democratic today than it ever was. Ironically, to become so it needed me in 
	uniform.&quot; (p.333) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Overview</b> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Musharraf is fourth in the line of 
	army chiefs of Pakistan who have ruled the country directly as heads of the 
	state. His memoir can be read as the summation of how these men have charted 
	the direction in which Pakistan’s political system has evolved, with the 
	army located at the center of its structure of power and privilege. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is claimed by this president in 
	uniform that the army is &quot;the last institution of stability left in 
	Pakistan.&quot;(p. 149) Perhaps no one will dispute that army has emerged as the 
	only institution in Pakistan that can claim stability, and has established 
	its defacto power in the political economy of Pakistan . The question is how 
	did the army achieve that kind of exclusive stability and power, and whether 
	it is conducive to the long term survival of Pakistan as a democratic state? 
	According to Musharraf’ narrative, corruption of the politicians who are 
	elected to exercise legislative and executive power lies at the root of 
	military’s ascendency. At some point when the political and financial 
	corruption of the politicians gets out of hand, the military as an honest 
	broker springs to action, removes the incumbent government, and &quot;saves the 
	nation.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But corruption is by no means the 
	exclusive endowment of the Pakistani politician. Political and financial 
	corruption in inherent in the political economy of capitalism, although it 
	can be more blatant and visible in countries like Pakistan where property 
	relations of capitalism are underdeveloped. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To check or contain the ubiquitous 
	problem of corruption, stable capitalist democracies provide for an 
	independent and constitutionally empowered judiciary as one of the three 
	branches of the state, the other two being the executive and the 
	legislative. The concept of Checks and balances applies to these three 
	branched of the state, not to the so called &quot;three power brokers&quot; as 
	conceived by Musharraf. Army is only part of the executive branch of the 
	state whose job is to take orders from the incumbent government and defend 
	the territorial borders of the state. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So long as Pakistan’s military high 
	command continues to cross the boundaries of its constitutionally allocated 
	role and preempts the judiciary from performing its functions, setting 
	itself up as the &quot;savior of the nation,&quot; so long as the army chief does not 
	learn to accept orders from the constitutionally recognized executive head 
	of the state and instead tries to impose his counsel on him or takes 
	military action to displace him, and so long as the army establishment 
	continues to spread its tentacles into the political sphere and manipulate 
	the process of elections to the legislature, the army will indeed be &quot;the 
	only institution of stability left in Pakistan. The rest of the 
	instititutions, the foundations of a modern democratic stare - an exacutive 
	that rules by consent and not commamd, a legislature that represents all the 
	people and a judiciary that understands and upholds the rule of law - will 
	either wither away or exist in a crippled and corrupt form. Unfortunately, 
	in that case, there will also be no end to the crisis of governance in 
	Pakistan. </font></p>
