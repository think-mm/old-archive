	<p></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The least expected death of Abu 
	Musab al-Zarqawi by US bombing fifty kilometer northeast of Baghdad has 
	stirred up global politics as well as economy. While Bush, Blair and 
	Rumsfeld, among others, sounded quite euphoric and optimistic about winning 
	their controversial “war on terror” being fought in Iraq at the death of 
	this cruel and barbaric terrorist from Jordan, the soaring oil prices fell 
	by more than a dollar a barrel following the end of Zarqawi. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, underneath Bush’s euphoric 
	statement that Zarqawi’s death is a “severe blow” to al-Qaeda and that “It’s 
	a victory in the global war on terror” lies the reality, which even Bush 
	could not hide. He had to admit: “Zarqawi is dead, but the difficult and 
	necessary mission in Iraq continues”. The only undeniable fact is what Bush 
	said in the Rose Garden: &quot;Now Zarqawi has met his end, and this violent man 
	will never murder again&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pragmatism demands that instead of 
	reading too much into the U.S. air strike that killed this terrorist, we pay 
	heed to the following signed statement, an ominously disturbing one, by Abu 
	Abdel-Rahman al-Iraqi, proclaimed as the deputy leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq: 
	“The death of our leaders is life for us. It will only increase our 
	persistence in continuing holy war so that the word of God will be supreme.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since it is an established fact now, 
	that there was absolutely no justification in drawing a synonymy between 
	Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship (and his alleged accumulation of Weapons of 
	Mass Destruction) and al-Qaeda terrorism; death of a prominent al-Qaeda 
	leader in Iraq does not change much in the nature of the ongoing insurgency 
	and civil war in this occupied country. As al-Qaeda has never been the main, 
	let alone the only insurgent group in Iraq, not even the total decimation of 
	this terrorist organization would de-escalate the insurgency in the country. 
	“If anything”, as one analyst has surmised, “his [Zarqawi’s] demise will 
	most probably lessen the antipathy many Iraqi Shia Muslims feel toward the 
	Sunni-dominated insurgency”. And this might signal a joint Shia-Sunni 
	insurgency, further jeopardizing the US-led coalition’s untenable foothold.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even if one cannot authenticate if 
	al-Qaeda’s second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahiri rebuked Zarqawi for 
	indiscriminate killing of Shiites and circulating his hostage-beheading 
	videos, purported to have diminished popular support for al-Qaeda, his death 
	might bring more adherents to the terrorist organization in Iraq. As Iraqis 
	constitute more than ninety per cent of al-Qaeda activists in the country, 
	there is no point celebrating the death of this Jordanian terrorist leader 
	assuming that this would lead to the disintegration of al-Qaeda network of 
	“foreigners” in the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are two dimensions of the 
	fall-out of Zarqawi’s death: one in regard to al-Qaeda, and another, to the 
	Iraqi insurgency. Let us look at the possible scenarios taking place 
	vis-à-vis the terrorist network within and beyond Iraq and the ongoing 
	insurgency, which is not necessarily linked with al-Qaeda terror. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those who do not consider organized 
	terrorism as mere by-products of groups of people’s psychological disorder, 
	classifying terrorists, including suicide bombers, only as irrational 
	fanatics devoid of any logic, know that terrorism is very much a logical 
	behaviour of groups and communities inspired by secular, religious or some 
	millennial ideologies. Terrorists thrive, to paraphrase Robert Pape [Dying 
	to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism], with “significant public 
	support”. And we know that despite having a veneer of religion, terrorism in 
	the name of religion is also aimed at attaining some secular socio-political 
	and economic goals beneath the surface. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, terrorism is not an end in 
	itself. Hence, sudden deaths of leaders, including the founders, of an 
	organized terrorist network like al-Qaeda not necessarily signal the death 
	of the terror network. If we look back to the medieval terrorist cult of the 
	Ismaili Shiites organized by Hasan bin Sabah (d.1124), popularly known as 
	the Assassins, we see his terrorist network outliving him by another 140-odd 
	years in the 1270s. And in view of the catastrophic and unimaginable 
	terrorist acts perpetrated by al-Qaeda before and after the Nine-Eleven, 
	there is no reason to underestimate its strength and capabilities. Most 
	importantly, terrorist organizations do not need millions of activists. 
	Fifty terrorists can wreck havoc affecting the lives of millions. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since there is nothing local or 
	“homegrown” about al-Qaeda terror, we cannot underestimate its global 
	character, its network transcending national boundaries. Since theoretically 
	the Muslims belong to a global Ummah (community), emerging out of the tiny 
	orthodox Wahhabi sect, al-Qaeda exploits the Islamic concept of Muslim 
	brotherhood albeit by running a cult of terror network in the name of 
	liberating “occupied Muslim territories”. As Islamic history is replete with 
	transnational movements with Muslim adherents joining distant wars in 
	support of fellow Muslims – Indian Muslims fighting for the Ottoman caliphs 
	and Bengali Muslims joining “Wahhabi” warriors in the northwest of the 
	Indian Subcontinent in the 19th and 20th centuries – there is nothing 
	surprising about the global network of al-Qaeda stretched out from the 
	Middle East to Pakistan and Indonesia to Canada. Thus al-Qaeda network in 
	Iraq is just another outpost of this global cult of “martyrs” and “warriors 
	of God”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, to turn to the implications of 
	Zarqawi’s sudden death on the Iraqi insurgency, we must not lose sight of 
	the artificial entity called Iraq, created by the Anglo-French imperialists 
	in the heartland of Arabia in and around 1919. The consequence of drawing 
	arbitrary lines across the desert by Britain and France without consulting 
	the indigenous people has been the perpetual conflict between the Shiite 
	majority (poorer and subjugated) and the dominant and rich Sunni minority in 
	Iraq. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Overpowering dictatorial regimes 
	since 1919, including that of Saddam Hussein, somehow maintained the 
	semblance of peace and order, although by favouring the Sunni minority Arabs 
	to the detriment of Shiite Arabs in the south and Sunni Kurds in the north. 
	The overthrow of the Saddam regime, on the one hand has emboldened the 
	Shiite majority, who are looking forward to their legitimate rights, redress 
	of their grievances and justice for their persecution by Saddam Hussein. The 
	Sunni minority, on the other hand, after their sudden loss of state 
	patronage and dominant role with the overthrow of Saddam regime have been 
	frantically trying to reverse the process. The American decision to disband 
	over a million Iraqi troops in the wake of the American occupation of the 
	country in 2003 has further worsened the situation. The so-called Sunni 
	insurgency is mainly a by-product of this unwise decision to disband the 
	Iraqi army. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is too simplistic to assume that 
	al-Qaeda has been the only driving force behind Iraqi insurgency and that 
	al-Qaeda without Zarqawi (or without Bin Laden in the global context) will 
	simply cease to function as an effective deterrent to the Coalition and its 
	local allies. There are all the elements of class and ethnic conflicts, 
	sectarian and communal violence and competition are present in the ongoing 
	insurgency in Iraq. Militant Shiite clergy and the obscurantist al-Qaeda 
	cult members are using religious symbols to settle old socio-political and 
	economic scores. The conflicts are also parts of local, regional and 
	national politics. Consequently Zarqawi’s role should be visualized in the 
	true perspective of ongoing national wars of liberation of at least three 
	visible nations of Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In sum, containing the activities of 
	a minor cult leader like Soko Asahara of the Aum Shinrikyo, a terrorist 
	Buddhist cult of Japan, cannot be compared with the death and detention of 
	scores of al-Qaeda leaders and activists. Al-Qaeda is not another Aum 
	Shinrikyo and Zarqawi or Bin Laden not another Soko Asahara. </font></p>
