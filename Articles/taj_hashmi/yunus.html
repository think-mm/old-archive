	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dear Professor Yunus: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You are so famous both within and 
	outside Bangladesh that I do not have to specify which “Professor Yunus” I 
	am writing to. Whether one likes it or not, by now micro-credit has gained 
	wide publicity and admiration and your name is closely associated with the 
	concept as the founder of the Grameen Bank. Your admirers, local academics, 
	professionals, journalists and members of the civil society and overseas 
	celebrities like the Clintons and Queen Sofia among many others, have 
	surrounded your image with such a halo that it is almost a blasphemy to 
	raise any doubt about the efficacy of micro-credit, let alone criticize the 
	concept and its proponent. Excepting a handful of professionals, academics, 
	journalists and those having strong reservations about NGOs, very few have 
	openly questioned the veracity of your claim that micro-credit alone will 
	alleviate and eventually eradicate poverty once for all. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, as you know, I am one of 
	the bitter critics of the NGO business and micro-credit as the panacea for 
	the affliction of poverty. I simply do not believe that unaccountable and 
	corrupt NGOs can be better alternatives to corrupt, inefficient and 
	unaccountable governments. While bad governance leads to chaos, an 
	emasculated government most certainly leads to anarchy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This open letter is in response to 
	your recent assertion, albeit a wishful one, that if you could become the 
	Chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission in Bangladesh you would have 
	drastically diminished the level and extent of corruption in the country, 
	consecutively, the most corrupt for the last three years. To be honest 
	Professor Yunus, your recent flamboyantly narcissist speech, widely 
	circulated in the media, is shocking and disappointing. What is even more 
	disappointing (but not surprising at all) is the total silence of the civil 
	society with regard to your condescending speech. Sadly, as many Bangladeshi 
	intellectuals directly or indirectly are beneficiaries of the mega NGOs, 
	including the Grameen Bank, they prefer remaining discreet to 
	“unnecessarily” rocking the boat or killing the golden goose. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since nobody has yet publicly 
	questioned, let alone criticized you, for your yet another 
	oversimplification of complexities (the first one was selling micro-credit 
	as the panacea for the scourge of poverty), I am taking the unpleasant job 
	of disagreeing with you. I hope you will not consider this letter offensive 
	as unlike many hypocritical beneficiaries of NGOs, I always use unkind words 
	for the mega NGOs through my writings and elocution. I have been 
	consistently opposing the half-baked theories of poverty alleviation through 
	micro-credit, empowerment of the poor, especially women, through NGOs, 
	establishment of the rule of law and democracy and elimination of corruption 
	or acceleration of economic growth in Bangladesh through methods and means 
	as suggested by the World Bank and the IMF. Had the emerging tigers and 
	dragons of East Asia followed the counter-productive suggestions of the 
	World Bank and the IMF, by now countries like Singapore and Malaysia would 
	have at best reached the level of Sri Lanka. After going through the 
	published versions of your over-simplified speech on how to eliminate 
	corruption in Bangladesh, I am convinced that you are even more out of touch 
	with the reality than the World Bank and IMF vis-à-vis corruption and the 
	process of its elimination in the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before I totally demolish your 
	outlandish corruption elimination theory, I make it absolutely clear that I 
	am not enjoying doing this at all. Knowing you personally since my 
	Chittagong University days as a colleague in the early 1970s, I admire your 
	honesty, integrity and patriotism. Let us simply agree to disagree at worst, 
	while I keep my fingers crossed hoping that you would drastically modify 
	your views on the methods of fighting corruption and eliminating poverty, 
	once for all. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have difficulties in believing 
	that you are really “jealous of Justice Sultan Hossain Khan when his name 
	was announced as the chairman [of the Anti-Corruption Commission, 
	Bangladesh].” Do you really believe that: “ In a country that tops the list 
	of corrupt countries in the world, it’s so easy to catch the perpetrators of 
	corruption”? This is really unbelievable, as you have asserted: “All that 
	the Commission needs to do is to lie with its mouth wide open, and all the 
	corrupt would drop into that mouth, one by one.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While it is heartening that you 
	would have simply crushed corruption if you could become the chairman of the 
	Anti-Corruption Commission, it is very disheartening that: a) you have 
	earmarked only the various government departments (only civilians) as the 
	main agents of corruption, leaving aside politicians, businessmen, bank 
	defaulters, NGO-Wallas, industrialists and others unmarked; and that b) you 
	would spend eighty per cent of the resources of the Commission to prevent 
	corruption through the “Present” and “Future” Departments and only twenty 
	per cent on the past perpetuators of corruption. Don’t you think it is high 
	time that all the corrupt civil and military bureaucrats, businessmen, 
	politicians and others should be arrested and tried (even posthumously) for 
	adopting corruption, at least since 1972? I think their properties should be 
	confiscated and they should spend decades as “third class” prisoners, 
	irrespective of their socio-economic standing. Unless past offenders are 
	tried and punished, present and future offenders would remain unperturbed 
	and defiant. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You would like to keep the 
	Commission corruption free. I would like to congratulate you for this noble 
	intention. However, the reality is such that you would be a helpless swimmer 
	in the ocean of corruption, eventually to drown and die unlamented. Your 
	close associates would call you a stupid and an idiot, “who despite having 
	the opportunity to make a fortune remained honest and died a pauper.” Don’t 
	you know Professor Yunus that the average Bangladeshi rich and powerful, 
	poor and helpless, educated and others believe in the maxim: “Churi bidya 
	baro bidya, jadi na paro dhara” [Stealing is a big art provided you do not 
	get caught red handed]? And they also know that only the pilferers and pick 
	pockets are caught red handed and punished while the big thugs involved in 
	the purchase of civil and military hardware and disbursement of foreign aid 
	and grants as ministers, bureaucrats and NGO-Wallas not only remain 
	unpunished but glorified as patriots and as “the only honest person among 
	his/her peers”. I am surprised at your total indifference to the prevalent 
	culture that glorifies, justifies and legitimises corruption. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is amazing that being an 
	economist of international repute and I assume, stature, you have not 
	mentioned the economic dimension, “the mother of all corruption”, in 
	Bangladesh. If we take the year 1966 as our index (the year when East 
	Bengalis for the first time collectively asserted their demand for 
	provincial autonomy and the end of West Pakistani exploitation), we find out 
	that what one could buy then with one rupee (Taka), needs the equivalent of 
	100 today. While one could buy a Tola (about eleven grams) of gold at Taka 
	100 in 1966, needs Taka 10,000 to buy the same quantity of gold today. This 
	roughly means that there has been 10,000 per cent inflation during the last 
	thirty-nine years. Correspondingly, if we want to maintain the status quo in 
	the purchasing power of the average consumer, say a clerk who earned around 
	Taka 300 per month in 1966 should get Taka 30,000 today. As you know 
	Professor Yunus, today the highest paid government servant draws less than 
	30,000 Taka as his/her gross salary. Consequently pointing fingers at 
	government officials – petty clerks, police constables and inspectors, 
	customs or taxation department officials – is grossly inappropriate and 
	unjust while politicians, high civil and military officials, businessmen, 
	industrialists and the ubiquitous NGO-Wallas and “respectable” members of 
	the civil society having connections with the powerful donor agencies are 
	robbing the country right and left, with impunity and immunity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is really frustrating to read 
	your speech Professor Yunus as you want to eliminate corruption, or at least 
	bring down the level of corruption in Bangladesh from number one in the 
	world to one of the bottom three in the SAARC region by merely becoming the 
	chairman of the Anti-Corruption Commission. Do you think that the Chairman 
	of the Commission can touch the most corrupt elements in society – 
	politicians, high civil and military officials, tax evading traders and 
	Garment-Wallas, bank defaulters and mega NGO-Wallas or the sacred cows of 
	the Western donor agencies? If you think so, then I am afraid; you are 
	really detached from the reality a la the typical absent-minded professor. 
	As an international personality you should know better than the laymen that 
	the Western donors love countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, the 
	Philippines, Nigeria and other corrupt countries in the Third World. They 
	hate to see too many Singapores and Malaysias (or even an assertive Zimbabwe 
	for curbing the interests of rich White farmers). In a society, rather an 
	extended peasant community like Bangladesh, which sustains on the 
	patron-client relationship, even the most powerful president or prime 
	minister cannot contain corruption, let alone the Chairman of the 
	Commission, whether it is Justice Khan or Professor Yunus. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Despite your hyperboles and 
	over-simplified platitudes, such as you would “terrorise” the corrupt 
	elements in the “safari parks of corruption” and by introducing reward and 
	prizes for the informers, mainly from the “Sufferers’ Association”, you 
	would curb corruption by publishing the indexes of the most corrupt 
	departments. You have also suggested that public exposures of corrupt 
	officials would bring shame, which would work as an antidote to corruption. 
	I wish you were right, but I am afraid, you sound like an absent- minded 
	professor, totally detached from the reality in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You are right Professor Yunus that 
	your ethics and reliance on the common people would be your most effective 
	weapons against corruption, but you have not considered the fact how 
	powerless and pessimistic the common people have turned into since 1971. 
	They have tried almost all the political parties and ideologies – 
	nationalism (both the “Bangali” and “Bangladeshi” variants), democracy, 
	secularism, socialism, Islam, one-party BKSAL, military oligarchies and 
	incompetent dynastic rule – and by now are reacting quite rationally, albeit 
	in a nihilistic way. They simply do not trust any body, neither from their 
	own ranks nor from the upper echelons, whom they identify as the most 
	corrupt and opportunistic people. Consequently they have accepted corruption 
	or dishonesty as the best policy. In the public psyche of Bangladesh today 
	an honest police, custom or taxation officer is an aberration, a totally 
	insensitive person having no love for his/her dependent family members. You 
	are partially right that “corruption is born in the womb of policies”, but 
	you have simply ignored the hard reality that a government official with a 
	family having no other source of income – properties, business or support 
	from rich relatives – just cannot survive with his salary. He/she has to 
	formulate “policies” to survive. Yes, by resorting to corruption. If he/she 
	decides to live within his/her means, then he/she has to forgo good food, 
	clothing and education for the children. Since proper medical care is a 
	luxury for the bulk of the population, and only the super rich can afford it 
	in Bangladesh and abroad, let us not talk about it with regard to an honest 
	government employee. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I think it is time Professor Yunus 
	that you give a second thought to what Professor Abul Barkat, a leading 
	economist of Bangladesh, has been harping on quite for some time. Instead of 
	identifying the corrupt government officials at the lower levels, he has 
	been telling us how the rich and powerful in the country have robbed about 
	seventy five per cent of the Taka 2,000 Billion Bangladesh received as 
	foreign aid since 1972.This amounts to a staggering Taka 1500 billion or 1.5 
	trillion. The corrupt government officials, on the other hand, are getting 
	Taka 160 million annually as bribe. If we multiply 160 million by 35 (years) 
	then the total bribe money amounts to Taka 5.6 billion. And this is a highly 
	exaggerated figure; as for the sake of an argument we are assuming that 
	government officials are taking bribe at the rate of Taka 160 million every 
	year since 1972. Please juxtapose Taka 1500 billion against Taka 5.6 billion 
	to re-locate the “safari park of corruption” not in the government offices 
	but in the living rooms of the rich and powerful Bangladeshis – politicians 
	and “others” who receive and disburse foreign aid. Do you think the Chairman 
	of the Anti-Corruption Commission has the power to take any action against 
	the rich and powerful? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In sum, the scope and definition of 
	corruption is very wide. If bribe taking is a corrupt practice, those who 
	bribe government officials to get certain undue advantages are also 
	resorting to corruption. It is very disappointing that you have not raised 
	your finger against the bank defaulters and tax evaders. Don’t you know the 
	“most honest” person in Bangladesh normally does not pay any income tax? 
	Don’t you think it amounts to corruption and high treason when NGO-Wallas 
	take money from the donors at nominal or no interest and charge as high as 
	28 to 32 per cent interest from their clients? I am sorry; this has been my 
	constant complaint against Grameen Bank and Proshika. I am a bit 
	disappointed, as you have not said anything about the rampant corruption in 
	the NGO sector. May I humbly ask, why? As Mao Ze Dong once said that the 
	fish starts rotting in the head first, you should have emphasized how the 
	heads of the monsters, the elite Ravanas of Bangladesh, are rotting first 
	and infesting the whole society. Silence is not always golden Professor 
	Yunus. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sadly, you have not mentioned the 
	institutionalized corruption, such as allotting land and houses for clients 
	and civil/military officials, for some unknown reason and justification, at 
	nominal price either by expropriating the previous owners (peasants, Hindus 
	or “Biharis”) anywhere in your long speech. Don’t you think what the 
	Pakistani government started with Dhanmondi, Gulshan, Banani and the 
	so-called Defence Housing Estates to favour select groups of civil and 
	military elite was reminiscent of what European settlers did in the 
	Americas, Australia and Israel? Don’t you think it is time that we consider 
	the expropriation of the previous non-elite owners of land at Baridhara, 
	Uttara and the various DOHS colonies after 1972 as illegal and extortionist 
	by nature? I think unless you look at the micro and macro levels of 
	corruption, which include state-sponsored “quiet violence” of robbing Paul 
	to pay Peter, tax evasion, abusing foreign aid by lying to the donors or 
	with their full knowledge by both the public and private (NGO) sectors, 
	paying ridiculously low wages to workers (US 35 cents per day, not hour, to 
	the average garment worker, for example) and squandering public money by 
	ruling parties, there is no way out of the morass of corruption. I think you 
	should de-emphasize bribery as the main domain of corruption in Bangladesh. 
	A new discourse is essential to weed out corruption taking Singapore and 
	Malaysia as our role models. I don’t think reducing the extent of corruption 
	marginally by hitting hard the poor clerks and petty officials is not only 
	counter-productive but also unethical. Please think about the remedy of the 
	state-sponsored and government-backed corruption in collaboration with the 
	rich and powerful. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I hope this letter is not annoying 
	as the whole purpose of this letter is not to annoy you at all but to draw 
	your attention to the real issues vis-à-vis corruption. I am sure the 
	average Bangladeshi, who is very emotional and gets a kick by emotive 
	hyperboles, is very pleased with your speech. Hence the numerous citing of 
	your speech in Bengali and English in the media. However, as I have not 
	bought the concept of micro-credit as the panacea for the scourge of poverty 
	and your claim that poverty would be only found in the museums in the 21st 
	century (and I congratulate myself for not being wrong); I think your 
	assumption that corruption can be contained and eliminated eventually by one 
	individual in charge of the Anti-Corruption Commission is as lame as your 
	theory of poverty elimination through micro-credit. Have a wonderful day.</font></p>
