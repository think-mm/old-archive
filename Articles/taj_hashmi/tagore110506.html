	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I simply pity these people along 
	with those who regard Rabindranath Tagore as the best poet, lyricist, 
	short-story writer, novelist, essayist, Nobel Laureate, Zamindar, master, 
	human being and what not! Those among these fanatically blind 
	Rabindra-Bhaktas, who do not believe in God, consider him as one and all his 
	writings as the substitute for the Bible, Quran and the Vedas. They are no 
	better than the most fanatic mullahs, Hindu revivalists and the Neo-Cons in 
	and around Washington D.C. All of them are dangerous to human dignity, peace 
	and civilization. Their role vis-à-vis a sovereign Bangladesh, which has NO 
	reason to be merged with West Bengal or India to become their slave 
	(again?), is simply vicious, heinous and all Bangladeshis should be aware of 
	it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India has already captured our 
	market. Do these India-Bhakta Tagorites want physical merger with India? I 
	would not be surprised if this is in their hidden or not-so-hidden 
	transcript! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I do not dispute the fact that 
	Tagore was a good poet, much better than most of his contemporaries in 
	undivided Bengal. But please give me a break; one who died in 1941 at 80 
	should be still regarded as the most relevant poet, essayist, novelist and 
	lyricist! While English-speaking people have profound regard for Shakespeare 
	and Byron, Keats and Shelley, Whitman and Tennyson, Bernard Shaw and 
	Bertrand Russell they do not stick to these luminaries’ ideas considering 
	them indispensable unlike what these Rabindra-Bhakta buffoons do with their 
	ONLY idol. While Frank Sinatra and Pat Boone, Dean Martin and Dionne 
	Warwick, the Beatles and ABBA (and even Michael Jackson) had their hey days, 
	now Western music lovers have other icons and favourite singers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tomorrow’s generations will have 
	their own favourite writers and singers, poets and philosophers. And this is 
	called progress. The way Rabindra-Bhaktas glorify Tagore songs and whatever 
	came out of his mouth or pen during the last two centuries establishes 
	nothing but their cultural bankruptcy and inferiority complex. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With hindsight, I blame Ayub Khan, 
	his Information Minister Khwaja Shahabuddin and his clownish Governor Monem 
	Khan for this ongoing Rabindra-Mania in Bangladesh since 1967. Since the 
	Pakistani ruling elite tried to impose a ban on Tagore song (which was a 
	foolish, undemocratic move) during the ascendancy of Bengali Nationalism in 
	East Pakistan one year after the introduction of the famous Six-point 
	Programme of the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (which was not meant 
	for secession but greater autonomy for East Pakistan), it simply backfired 
	and Tagore became the symbol of Bengali Nationalism. It was nothing but a 
	negative support for Tagore to defy and eventually overthrow the Ayub regime 
	for the restive Bengali nationalists. Consequently those who could hardly 
	understand anything about Tagore song, started patronizing and singing his 
	lyrics. Chhayanat and similar music schools proliferated afterwards. And the 
	rest is history. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even the radical maverick, brave and 
	honest Professor Ahmed Sharif (my guru for various reasons, especially his 
	integrity, courage and scholarship) would privately tell us: “Ei Rabi 
	Thakurer ‘tumi’ ta ke re bapu, eta to bujhlam na.” He was also critical of 
	Tagore’s opposition to the Dhaka University proposal and his feudal, 
	anti-people, pro-British stand most of the time up to his seventies. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those who deny Tagore’s anti-Muslim, 
	anti-East Bengali, anti-peasant, anti-communist and out and out 
	pro-Zamindar, pro-Bhadralok (Hindu professional classes) and pro-Mahajan 
	(moneylender) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">stand, at least up to the 1930s (in 
	his seventies), are in a state of denial or totally ignorant of the facts. 
	Why did the Hindu Zamindar-Bhadralok-Mahajan triumvirate oppose the 
	Partition of Bengal? Was not the main reason for their concerted opposition 
	to a separate province of Eastern Bengal &amp; Assam due to their apprehension 
	of losing out their Zamindari estates in East Bengal, legal profession and 
	jobs eventually to the majority Muslim community? Those Bangladeshis who 
	deny these facts are either die hard fanatics or supporters of United Bengal 
	(as former slaves often suffer from the a perpetual sense of devotion or 
	Bhakti for their former masters – I am NOT making this up, one may check 
	with the vast literature on social-psychology, cultural anthropology and 
	history, especially writings by Ranajit Guha and other “Subaltern” 
	historians). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In view of the above, Tagore’s 
	opposition to the Partition of Bengal (1905-11) and the Dhaka University 
	proposal (1914-20) had nothing so “patriotic” about it. He was not at all 
	different from fellow Hindu Zamindar – Bhadralok who preferred to live in 
	the urban comfort of Calcutta to the rural discomfort of East Bengal but by 
	exploiting East Bengali peasants and working classes as landlords, lawyers 
	and moneylenders. They also opposed the Partition and any move to establish 
	a university in Dhaka, which they rightly envisaged, would eventually strip 
	of their undue privileges and advantages as the hegemons of East Bengali 
	masses. Calcutta based Hindu lawyers did not want another High Court in 
	Dhaka, let alone another university to produce East Bengali Muslim graduates 
	to compete in the shrinking job market, legal profession and in the arena of 
	politics. One Fazlul Huq and one Suhrawardy were too much for them to 
	swallow in the 1930s and 1940s. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With hindsight we realize that had 
	there been no Partition of Bengal in 1905 and eventually in 1947 (the second 
	one mainly due to Hindu Bhadralok opposition to united Bengal as Hindus 
	would be perpetually a minority there against the Muslims) there would not 
	have been any Bangladesh in 1971 or later. So, those who regard Tagore as 
	the “dreamer” of Bangladesh a la Iqbal as the “dreamer of Pakistan”, are 
	simply misinforming themselves and others by romanticizing history with no 
	regard to facts and figures. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">History tells us without any 
	ambiguity that the anti-Partition Swadeshi Movement (1905-11) in Bengal was 
	out and out a Hindu movement (only a handful of Muslim initially supported 
	it while a fraction of them continued their support till the annulment of 
	the Partition in 1911). Muslim elites and even peasants and working classes 
	took a leading role against the Swadeshi Movement and villages in Mymensingh 
	and Comilla witnessed bloody Hindu-Muslim rioting during the Swadeshi days 
	over the Partition. In Jamalpur and elsewhere in greater Mymensingh, Hindu 
	terrorist Swadeshi volunteers, who took oath at the alter of goddess Kali 
	and sang Bankim’s anti-Muslim Bande Mataram, attacked Muslim supporters of 
	the Partition with Ma Kalir Boma (Mother Kali’s Bomb). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sumit Sarkar has beautifully 
	narrated these events in his History of the Swadeshi Movement. One should 
	read Nirad Chaudhuri’s Autobiography of an Unknown Indian and Abul Mansur 
	Ahmed’s Amar Dekha Rajnitir Panchash Bachhar to find out the truth about the 
	communal nature of the Swadeshi Movement. And Kabi Guru Rabindranath was 
	among the ardent supporters of the Swadeshi Movement. He wrote “Amar Sonar 
	Bangla, Ami Tomay Bhalobashi” to inspire the supporters of the Swadeshi 
	Movement. He wrote “Jana Gana Mana Adhinayaka Jaya Hey” in 1911. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While some historians think he wrote 
	this song in praise of King-Emperor George V out of gratitude as he declared 
	the annulment of the Partition in 1911 at the Delhi Durbar, others allude it 
	to Tagore’s love for the Indian “Jana Gana” as the “Bharata Bhagya Bidhata”. 
	Although I am very skeptical about the second assertion, yet I am not being 
	judgemental as I do not have any evidence to substantiate either of the 
	assertions. However, it is most likely that he wrote the song eulogizing 
	George V as the “Bharata Bhagya Bidhata” (determinant of the fate of the 
	Indians). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, those who think Tagore was not 
	an anti-Muslim communal person by citing examples from his short stories and 
	fictions where he portrayed some Muslims as noble characters should re-read 
	the following Tagore poems: Nava Barsha, Shivaji Utshab, Ma Bhoi and 
	Brahman. What type of “non-communal” Maha Rishi (Great Saint) could glorify 
	Hindu and Brahmin supremacy and the inhuman and barbaric Sati (Suttee) or 
	burning of Hindu widows alive on their husband’s funeral pyre? His Shivaji 
	Utshab was horridly a glorification of Hindutva as this poem not only 
	eulogized Shivaji the Maratha nationalist against Mughal paramountcy (I have 
	no problem with that) but it also contemplates the vision of “one religion 
	in one country”. Was it very dissimilar from Hitler’s one race in one 
	country or the fascist Shiv Sena’s and RSS’s advocacy for unadulterated 
	Hindu supremacy in India? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have Tagore apologists 
	everywhere, in every forum, print and electronic media both in South Asia 
	and beyond. One of them (Mesbahuddin Jowher) in a recent posting to the 
	Mukto-Mona on May 8, 2006 wrote an apologia for Tagore in Bengali, “Was 
	Tagore a Communalist?” According to him, Tagore only toyed with Hindutva and 
	anti-Muslim expressions up to the early 20th century and afterwards he was a 
	changed man. This is not at all true. In early 20th century Tagore was in 
	his forties and fifties. He opposed the Dhaka University proposal during1914 
	and 1920 (joined a rally at Garer Math in Calcutta and put his signature to 
	the campaign) when he was 53-59 year-old. We should not thrust any greatness 
	on someone who in his forties and fifties continued to use very 
	objectionable, racist and hateful expressions like javana, mlechha, nerey to 
	denote Muslims a la Bankim style. Tagore was sort of a civil person 
	vis-à-vis his public stand towards Hindu-Muislim problem in his seventies. 
	By then it was too late, too little to glorify him as a saint and what not!
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He was not that different so far as 
	anti-Muslim public assertions are concerned from Bankim and Sarat 
	Chatterjee. While Bankim considered Indian Muslims “unclean skin head 
	foreigners” (mlechha javana nerey), Sarat Chatterjee publicly demanded the 
	expulsion of Indian Muslims for the sake of a better India (in 1926 at a 
	public meeting organized by the Hindu Mahasabha – see Joya Chatterjee’s 
	Hindu Communalism and the Partition of Bengal), Tagore was sometimes more 
	subtle in venting out his anti-Muslim sentiment. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those Tagore apologists who defend 
	his opposition to the Dhaka University proposal as a device to “save 
	Calcutta University” (what a rubbish of an argument!) totally ignore the 
	fact that Tagore in his Nobel Acceptance Lecture in 1913 (or 1914?) 
	announced that he was going to establish a university at Bolpur (Shanti 
	Niketan University) with the award money. Would not another university not 
	far from Calcutta be detrimental to Calcutta University? Why could not he 
	establish a university in East Bengal for the children of his exploited 
	tenants? Why did not he establish anything worth mentioning other than the 
	Patishar Bank (very similar to Grameen Bank but interest free for his 
	tenants in Naogaon district in North Bengal not long before his death) for 
	the poor in East Bengal? No Rabindra-Bhakta has any satisfactory answers to 
	these questions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In sum, let Tagore be in peace. Let 
	people sing and listen to Tagore song, read his poems and other writings and 
	let scholars and laymen write volumes after volumes in evaluating his 
	literary genius. I have no problem with that. We cannot accept any assertion 
	portraying Tagore as the most humane, non-communal, benevolent Zamindar (an 
	oxymoronic expression like a “kind butcher” or “Hitler, the great lover of 
	the Jews”), a “dreamer of Bangladesh”, a promoter of education (yes, almost 
	exclusively for Hindu Bengalis) and an anti-imperialist etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am very puzzled at Bengali 
	communists’ (mostly the hitherto Muscovites also known as the “Harmonium 
	Party”) adoration of Tagore, who in his fore-word to Pramatha Chaudhury’s 
	book, Ryoter Katha (Calcutta 1928) compared communism with fascism and 
	condemned those who wanted to abolish the Zaminadari and Mahajani ( usurious 
	money-lending) systems. He sarcastically described the communists as 
	“lalmukho” (red-faced) Russian agents and jeered at their programme: “Ei 
	dharoni nir-jamidar nir-mahajan hoilei jeno shanty ashibe” [paraphrased] or 
	“as if this world will be a blissful place without the Zamindar and Mahajan 
	around.” Tagore was 67-year-old when he defended the extortionist Zamindari 
	and Mahajani systems. And our Rabindra-Bhakta friends still consider him a 
	great humanist friend of the poor and oppressed and “dreamer of Bangladesh”!
