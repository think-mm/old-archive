		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The 
		latest spine chiller from <ST1>Afghanistan</ST1> is the revolting news 
		about sentencing one Abdul Rahman to death for converting to 
		Christianity, a capital crime as per the obscurantist Shariah law. One 
		might be surprised at the recrudescence of barbarism in the name of 
		Islam in presence of UN peace keepers and almost five years after the 
		overthrow of the demonic Taliban regime. However, those who know about 
		the Shariah code have nothing to be surprised about dispensing death 
		penalty to apostates from Islam. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">In 
		view of the judgment, one may even assume that since the UN has 
		recognized the post-Taliban regime, Hamid Karzai being an important <ST1>
		US</ST1> ally in its “war against terrorism”, the Afghan government, 
		including its judiciary, is a legitimate part of a sovereign country. 
		Consequently one may surmise that condemning someone to death for 
		apostasy or blasphemy in accordance with the Shariah, as it has been 
		going on in countries like <ST1>Saudi Arabia</ST1>, 
<ST1>Iran</ST1> and <ST1>Pakistan</ST1>, is but an “internal affair” of a 
		sovereign entity like <ST1>Afghanistan</ST1>.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">On 
		the one hand, some American observers are raising the question if the 
		Afghan regime wants to revert to the Taliban way of doing things, then 
		it should do so without American help; and on the other, both the US 
		President and Canadian Prime Minister have asked the Afghan President to 
		restore the freedom of religion in the country in accordance with the UN 
		Declaration of Human Rights. We believe, despite the sabre-rattling by 
		mullahs and judges, finally the Afghan government will prevail by 
		unhooking Abdul Rahman from the claws of the Shariah. As we understand, 
		unfortunately this will happen not by scrapping the barbaric Shariah 
		code but through a deceptive compromise, by declaring the victim not an 
		apostate but an insane.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Both 
		the progressive Muslims and upholders of human rights everywhere should 
		come forward and declare unanimously: “Enough is enough, no more Shariah 
		law anywhere in the East and West.” Let us bury the past inadequacies, 
		vacillations and double standards of liberal Muslims and non-Muslims 
		(mainly due to the exigencies of the Cold War) towards the violation of 
		human rights in the name of Shariah – from <ST1>Saudi Arabia</ST1> to <ST1>
		Iran</ST1> and <ST1>Sudan</ST1> to <ST1>Pakistan</ST1> and <ST1>
		Afghanistan</ST1>. Both the liberal democrats and secular humanists in 
		the West and East, including the Muslim World, should fulfill their 
		moral obligations towards humanity. Nothing would be more 
		counter-productive than portraying the West as the enemy of Islam and 
		the Muslims as obscurantist Shariah loving terrorists. A bridge is 
		essential and a “dialogue of civilizations”, to paraphrase former 
		Iranian President Khatami, between Islam and the West is the only viable 
		alternative to the Shariah obscurantism and provocative Islamophobia 
		nourished in the West.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">
		Exerting pressure on Karzai to save Abdul Rahman’s life is fine, but not 
		enough. Exposing the un-Islamic nature of the Shariah code, together by 
		liberal, progressive Muslims and non-Muslim upholders of human rights 
		and dignity with a view to abolishing the so-called Islamic code 
		everywhere is the only solution to the violation of human rights in the 
		name of Islam, once for all.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Those 
		who consider attacking Shariah as an affront on Islam and as a violation 
		of the UN Charter should know that there is nothing “divine” about the 
		code. Shariah is the combination of legal opinions of Muslim jurists 
		sought and enforced by medieval Muslim rulers. Although claimed to be 
		emanating from the Quran, Shariah code is mainly based on problematic 
		“sayings” of Prophet Muhammad, individual and collective opinions of 
		medieval jurists, local customs and common sense.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
		Interestingly, the Islamic scripture or the Quran spells out: “<span lang="EN">Let 
		there be no compulsion in religion” [2:256] and does not prescribe any 
		death penalty for apostasy either:</span><span lang="EN" style="color: black">
		</span></font><span style="color: black"><font size="3" face="Verdana">
		“Surely (as for) those who believe then disbelieve, again believe and 
		again disbelieve, then increase in disbelief, Allah will not forgive 
		them nor guide them in the (right) path” [4:137]. The Quran sanctions 
		death penalty for murder and other horrendous crimes, not apostasy: “</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><tt><span style="font-family: Verdana">You 
		shall not kill any person - for GOD has made life sacred - except in the 
		course of justice. If one is killed unjustly, then we give his heir 
		authority to enforce justice” [17:33]. One also finds the following in 
		the Quranic text: </span></tt></font></span>
		<font size="3" face="Verdana">“For this reason did We prescribe to the 
		children of Israel that whoever slays a soul, unless it be for 
		manslaughter or for mischief in the land, it is as though he slew all 
		men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men” 
		[5:32].</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">
		However, <span style="color: black">the Shariah law condemns the 
		apostate to death. One finds striking similarity between this barbaric 
		provision with the Biblical prescription: </span>“And he that 
		blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and 
		all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as 
		he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, 
		shall be put to death”<span style="color: black"> [Bible, King James 
		Version, Leviticus 24:16].<O></O></span></font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">
		<span style="color: black">There are many other incongruities between 
		the Islamic scripture and the Shariah code. As for example, w</span>hile 
		the Quran prescribes 100 lash as punishment for adultery, the Shariah 
		sanctions stoning to death for both the adulterer and adulteress, in 
		accordance with the Old Testament.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The 
		Shariah with all its variations and contradictions has created problems 
		both for Muslims and non-Muslims in Muslim-dominated as well as other 
		countries in our times. The term “Shariah” evokes bad memories among its 
		victims as well as opponents who want the abolition or drastic reforms 
		of this Draconian code. Our experience tells us that Shariah is 
		inherently prejudicial to women, non-Muslims and freethinkers and that 
		its language, spirit and above all, execution, go against the spirit, 
		ideals and teaching of Islam. However, ironically the mullahs, who are 
		supposed to be the upholders of the ideals of Islam, have been the main 
		promoters and defenders of Shariah which stands in contravention of 
		human rights, decency and civilized behavior. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The 
		collective ignorance of the Muslim community combined with the vested 
		interests of many Muslims is sustaining this incongruous Shariah code. 
		The Muslim community in <ST1>Afghanistan</ST1> and beyond can replace 
		this absurd, outdated un-Islamic code of Shariah with a liberal and 
		modern one only through collective efforts of the members of the civil 
		society, human rights groups, intellectuals and liberal politicians. 
		They need to educate both the mullahs and ordinary Muslims with regard 
		to the obscurantist aspects of the Shariah. The core of the problem is 
		political. So, only social reformist agenda by a few cultural groups 
		will not be able to resolve the issue.</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">
		However, this arduous task requires global support from the UN agencies 
		to the various human rights organizations, liberal democratic 
		governments and donor-driven development agencies and NGOs. The West 
		must call the shots not by demonizing Islam, Prophet Muhammad and the 
		not-so-monolithic Muslim community or by selective condemnation of the 
		anti-Western “Islamic” countries such as <ST1>Iran</ST1> and <ST1>Sudan</ST1>. 
		Violation of human rights in any form in “Islamic” countries like <ST1>
		Saudi Arabia</ST1>, <ST1>Pakistan</ST1>, <ST1>Egypt</ST1> or <ST1>
		Bangladesh</ST1>, despite their pro-Western foreign policies, should 
		become a global concern. With UN sponsored sanctions, and if required, 
		military interventions as taken against the rogue Serbian regime in the 
		early 1990s, the terror of Shariah may be contained and eliminated 
		eventually. </font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The 
		Afghan President’s assurance to the West that his government is not 
		going to yield to the pressure of the blood-thirsty mullahs who want to 
		kill Abdul Rahman for apostasy is but an isolated act of redemption, not 
		an outright victory against Shariah and barbaric obscurantism in the 
		name of Islam. We have a long way to tread to get human rights and 
		dignity for all the victims of Shariah in <ST1>Afghanistan</ST1> and 
		beyond.</font></p>
