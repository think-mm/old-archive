	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What was once unthinkable, has 
	happened. Up to the 1970s, to experts and laymen across the board, Islamic 
	resurgence was the least likely thing to ever take place in Bangladesh. 
	While Islamic resurgence at every level of the polity had become a fait 
	accompli by the early 1990s, since the turn of the century, there is nothing 
	unusual about Islamic militancy, terror and even suicide bombing anywhere in 
	the country. The erstwhile “secular and socialist” Bangladesh has turned 
	into “Islamic”. Having Islam as its “state religion” and Islam-oriented 
	parties and groups as important power brokers since the overthrow of the 
	Sheikh Mujib-led one-party rule in 1975, Bangladesh has had a complete 
	volte-face. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What had began with the official 
	renunciation of the symbolic “secularism” and “socialism” by General Ziaur 
	Rahman got further momentum during General Ershad’s “benign” military 
	autocracy. Islam-oriented political parties have not only emerged as 
	legitimate political forces having dozens of parliamentarians and ministers, 
	but during the last five years or so Islamic militancy has also emerged as 
	an ominous threat to the polity. The Jamaat-i-Islami, the most well-known 
	and well-organized Islamic party has emerged as an important power broker or 
	“kingmaker” in the formation of governments in the country. Despite its 
	ideological and methodological differences with the ultra-orthodox Deobandi 
	or “Wahhabi” groups, main promoters of the Al Qaeda and Taliban in South 
	Asia, sections of Bangladeshi politicians, intellectuals and laymen love to 
	portray the Jamaat as the main steering force behind the quasi-Taliban 
	terrorist groups in Bangladesh. Although this over-simplification is 
	politically motivated to discredit the Jamaat and its coalition partner, the 
	BNP under Khaleda Zia, by their political opponents under Sheikh Hasina of 
	the Awami League, many Bangladeshis without any political bias also believe 
	in this fabrication. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Professor Monoar Kabir in the volume 
	under review has done a good job in dispelling some of the myths and 
	over-simplified ideas about the nature and implications of Jamaat-i-Islami 
	politics in Bangladesh since the 1970s. This volume is a refreshing 
	departure from popular myths and politically motivated misinformation and 
	half-truths about Islamic politics in general. Those who cannot 
	differentiate between the Jamaat and Taliban-Al-Qaeda genre of politics will 
	find this work revealing, enlightening and useful. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is the only objective study of 
	the Jamaat-i-Islami in Bangladesh after Razia Akter Banu’s excellent work, 
	Islam in Bangladesh (E.J. Brill, Leiden 1992). Kabir in his introductory 
	chapter has given an excellent account of global Islamic movements during 
	and after the Cold War. His appraisal of the Bangladeshi Islamists is also 
	very useful; so are his factual accounts and analytical assessments of the 
	rise and evolution of the Jamaat, its role in national politics and 
	relationship with other Islamic and “secular” parties in Bangladesh. His 
	bibliography is impressive. Unlike the average political scientists, who 
	only rely on published sources (books, journals and newspapers), Kabir has 
	profusely used unpublished sources and official publications, reports and 
	private papers of various political parties and organizations, including the 
	Jamaat, to enrich his facts, figures and analyses. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The popular versions of the story as 
	to why Islam has re-emerged in the arena of politics in Bangladesh are 
	sketchy over-simplified narrations of complex issues and problems, devoid of 
	any logic, facts and objectivity. Both Western and Indian journalists and 
	their local counterparts, sections of Bangladeshi political leaders and 
	activists belonging to particular parties and groups author and publicize 
	such sensational stories. Western journalists like Bertil Lintner and Eliza 
	Griswold narrate sensational stories about the “impending” Taliban takeover 
	of Bangladesh out of ignorance if not malice towards the country. Hence the 
	portrayal of BNP and its political allies, including the Jamaat-i-Islami, as 
	“friends” and “in league with” Bin Laden and his associates is very common.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many anti-BNP and 
	anti-Jamaat-i-Islami politicians and their adherents find it quite 
	convenient to impute the country-wide terrorist attacks and suicide bombing 
	in 2005 to the Jamaat-i-Islami. The over-heated, sharply polarized politics 
	in Bangladesh, which has roughly divided the polity into the pro- and 
	anti-Awami League parties, groups and adherents is the main bottleneck 
	towards any objective study of political parties including the BNP, Awami 
	League or Jamaat-e-Islami. Similarly a dispassionate, academic exercise on 
	Islamic resurgence, militancy and fanaticism has also become very difficult 
	in the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In view of the above, it is indeed 
	an achievement to write anything with objectivity on the Jamaat-i-Islami in 
	Bangladesh. One takes the risk of getting branded as “pro-Taliban”, 
	“anti-Bangladesh”, “anti-Liberation” and “pro-Pakistani” by not subscribing 
	to the popular version of the story about the Jamaat. Consequently there is 
	a lacuna, a big black hole, in the popular narratives on Islamic resurgence, 
	militancy and terror in Bangladesh, especially those narrated by Bangladeshi 
	scholars, politicians and journalists. The volume under review is an 
	exception in this regard. Bhuian Monoar Kabir has taken a bold step away 
	from the black hole of Bangladesh’s contemporary history and over-polarized 
	politics. His findings, analyses and conclusions are helpful towards a 
	timely departure from the realm of subjectivity and politically biased 
	thoughts. This timely, objective study of the Jamaat-i-Islami in Bangladesh 
	is a useful addition to the very short list of standard works on Islam by 
	Bangladeshi scholars. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We need to understand the importance 
	of Islam both in the private and public domains of the Muslims in 
	Bangladesh. Unfortunately, many secular/Islam bashing Bangladeshi 
	intellectuals think that Islam is just a peripheral, alien concept, subject 
	to subsumption under Bengali Nationalism or what they think is “secularism”. 
	Although apparently Bangladesh came into being in the name of Bengali 
	nationalism and secularism, the country has retained its Muslim/Islamic 
	character for the obvious reasons. Firstly, it is the third largest Muslim 
	country after Indonesia and Pakistan . Secondly, those who believe and 
	promote the primordiality of the Muslim/Islamic identity for the country 
	also argue that a) the emergence of Bangladesh did not signal the death of 
	the “two-nation-theory” as the Muslim majority East Pakistan, for various 
	reasons, emerged with a new name as an independent country; and that b) 
	“secularism” was never a raison d’etre for the Liberation Struggle of 1971.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not only “pro-Pakistani elements” 
	but many leading pro-Bangladeshis also hold similar views. It is noteworthy 
	that while the late Abul Mansur Ahmed, a leading pro-Bangladeshi figure, 
	portrayed the emergence of Bangladesh as the late realization of the “Lahore 
	Resolution” (of 1940 for separate Muslim states in the Subcontinent), Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman in his first public speech in independent Bangladesh in 1972 
	proudly asserted that Bangladesh was the second largest “Muslim country” in 
	the world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Consequently it is hardly surprising 
	that Bangladesh has retained its Muslim/Islamic character and of late has 
	re-asserted its Muslim/Islamic identity by incorporating Islam as the “state 
	religion” through an amendment of the Constitution. This politically 
	motivated, opportunistic legislation of 1988 by General Ershad has remained 
	intact under the post-military oligarchs of the country. The pervasive 
	influence of Islam culturally, socially and politically has remained intact 
	and has been rather gaining ground in Bangladesh in the recent years. One 
	may explain the Islamic resurgence in Bangladesh in terms of “a global 
	phenomenon”, nothing so unique about the country. One may attribute it to 
	the “failure of the welfare state”- as it happened in erstwhile “secular and 
	socialist” Algeria, Egypt, the Sudan, Afghanistan and Indonesia. Islamic 
	resurgence in the post-Cold War era also reflects the growing frustration of 
	the Muslim lower middle classes and urban poor at the failure of the 
	promised welfare state under “secular” nationalist regimes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most Muslim countries during the 
	heydays of the Cold War adopted nationalism, democracy and secularism 
	(socialism in selective countries) as parts of the state ideology. A handful 
	of countries like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia clung to Islam and carefully 
	shunned democracy and secularism as the state ideology throughout the Cold 
	War (and afterwards). Muslim kingdoms in North Africa and the Persian Gulf, 
	including Iran, remained autocratic and secular. What is striking that 
	political Islam emerged as the biggest challenge to the status quo in the 
	Muslim World, in Iran during the last decade of the Cold War; and elsewhere 
	not long after. The so-called national-secular-democratic (and socialist) as 
	well as the Islam-oriented autocracies witnessed the rise of political 
	Islam. It would be too trite an assumption that the phenomenon called 
	Islamic resurgence has been a by-product of pre-modern orthodoxy and 
	backwardness associated with mullahs and their likes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact Islamism, as it is often 
	called, has positive correlations with disadvantaged Muslims having 
	incomplete or no access to modernism, socio-economic and political rights 
	and privileges. Although millennial Islamic ideologues, Hasan Banna, Sayyid 
	Qutb, Maududi or Khomeini could be the main inspirations and militants like 
	Bin Laden, Al Zawaheri, Shaykh Abdur Rahman or the Bangla Bhai the main 
	leaders, Islamic insurgency and fanaticism are primarily political, not 
	spiritual or religious problems. Muslim militants are not just insane 
	fanatics, mindless killers and angry young men (and women) determined to go 
	back to the mythical golden era of Islam. They mostly represent socially 
	backward, politically powerless and economically exploited classes among 
	Muslims. Their perceived enemies could be local politicians, government 
	officials, national or international personalities, governments and 
	organizations supposed to be working against Muslims at local, national or 
	international levels. While born-again-Muslims and de-classed terrorists 
	like Bin Laden, Al Zawaheri, Muhammad Atta and their likes could be 
	instrumental in organizing terrorist attacks, the real factor behind 
	terrorism is economic (or “class-struggle” in the Marxian parlance) and real 
	activists mostly represent various under-privileged classes among Muslims.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This important work re-appraises the 
	nature of Islamic movements in Bangladesh, shedding light on the background, 
	rise and evolution of the Jamaat, which is the most important Islamic party 
	in the country. Kabir’s contributions include the exploration of the 
	Jamaat’s role as an important power broker in the formation of governments 
	and its importance in the post-Nine-Eleven Bangladesh. Kabir through this 
	well-researched book has given an objective appraisal of the various Islamic 
	groups and parties of Bangladesh highlighting their similarities and 
	differences with the Jamaat. He has succeeded in proving that the Jamaat is 
	neither pro-Taliban nor pro-Iranian; and most importantly, that the party 
	has accepted constitutional methods of politics by participating in 
	elections. And as he has underscored, there has been major shifts in the 
	modus operandi and modus vivendi of the Jamaat vis-à-vis politics and 
	conflict resolution. In the light of this interesting book, one may be 
	optimistic in assuming that in the long run the Jamaat will emerge as a 
	liberal democratic political party; and that the suffix “Islami” will no 
	longer be its political liability. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Islam is not going to be 
	irrelevant socially or politically in the Muslim World overnight, 
	Jamaat-i-Islami will continue to play an important role in the body politic 
	of Bangladesh in the foreseeable future. By distancing itself from the 
	“Islamic terrorist” groups, the Jamaat has already gained the confidence of 
	Western governments, analysts and policy makers, who badly need 
	“progressive” and “moderate” Islamic groups and individuals in the Muslim 
	World. This well-researched volume indicates that Jamaat’s biggest liability 
	could be its controversial role in the Liberation War of 1971, as it openly 
	collaborated with the Pakistani occupation army. On the other hand, it also 
	appears that its main strength lies in its organization, committed cadres, 
	supporters and members, which are lacking in almost every other political 
	party in Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In sum, the importance of this 
	volume lies in the materials painstakingly collected and collated by the 
	author for the benefit of scholars and curious readers. He could have 
	possibly given better appraisals and analyses. Nevertheless, this is an 
	important addition to the corpus of literature on Islam in Bangladesh 
	society and politics. Both scholars and students will find it useful as not 
	much has been written on Islam in contemporary Bangladesh. Anyone interested 
	in knowing more than what one finds in newspapers and bazaar gossips in 
	Bangladesh about the state of Bangladesh society and politics, Islamic 
	resurgence and militancy would find this volume useful and refreshing.
