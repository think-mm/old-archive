  <p align="justify">Since the horrific and most unfortunate August 21 bombings 
  in Dhaka in an Awami League rally killing several people and seriously 
  injuring several party workers and more than a dozen policemen in charge of 
  the personal security of Sheikh Hasina,amateur analysts and professional 
  &quot;experts&quot; have come up with their versions of the story. Some have found out 
  &quot;concrete evidence&quot; of the involvements of members of the ruling coalition 
  under Khaleda Zia in these ghastly attacks. While Sheikh Hasina, the leading 
  proponent of this theory, has even portrayed the Prime Minister as a 
  &quot;murderer&quot;, some Bangladeshi analysts have come up with the &quot;Indian 
  involvement theory&quot; in a recent posting in the web. </p>
  <p align="justify">The way a section of the press, politicians and 
  intellectuals have been trying to prove the involvement of the ruling 
  coalition, India, Pakistan, CIA, Maoist insurgents and others in the bombing 
  is not going to help Bangladesh in the short- and long-run at all. </p>
  <p align="justify">It is very disappointing that instead of uniting to weed 
  out terror from Bangladesh, our politicians, journalists and intellectuals 
  both within and outside the country have not yet shown the maturity, civility 
  and decency to condemn terrorism with objectivity, integrity and honesty. 
  They, instead, have been showing their narrow, tribal/peasant rusticity and 
  bias in explaining the attacks with a view to gaining some political leverage. 
  They have unfortunately failed to realise that the reactionary forces behind 
  these heinous attacks will be more than happy to see whatever is left of 
  liberal democratic, secular and patriotic forces in the country, constantly 
  fighting among themselves instead of trying to find out the real culprits. </p>
  <p align="justify">The perpetual polarization between the Awami League and BNP, 
  and between the so-called patriots and traitors, will only bring more 
  disasters finally turning the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; state into anarchy. It is high 
  time that the civil society comes out of their Awami-BNP cocoons to mobilize 
  mass support against terror, Khaleda-Hasina together, for the sake of the 
  country. One may only guess if and when the terrorists will again hit the 
  divided polity. And the next time leaders from the ruling party may fall prey 
  to such attacks. So, both the BNP and its &quot;Islamic&quot; allies should also stop 
  the blaming game with a view to fighting terror. Both the ruling coalition and 
  the opposition have the responsibility to find out the real terrorists and 
  their motives. </p>
  <p align="justify">It is, however, very pertinent that we find out the real 
  causes as to why terrorism is gaining ground in Bangladesh. We need not go 
  that far to find out the real factors behind these acts. What history has 
  taught us (and we always forget the lesson) that terrorism is a by-product of 
  a section of the population of a given country turning desperate to change the 
  status quo when that section finds all other peaceful means ineffective. 
  Terrorists also hit with a view to establishing themselves as the alternative 
  to the existing political parties and groups to deliver the promised goods and 
  services for the benefit of the majority. The way Hitler and Mussolini 
  succeeded in capturing power through terror, eventually with mass support, 
  should be an eye-opener for both the ruling parties and their opposition. </p>
  <p align="justify">Have they succeeded in delivering the promised goods and 
  services to the average Bangladeshis in the last thirty-odd years? is the 
  question. The never-ending process of the rich getting richer by defrauding 
  banks, depriving workers their due and by plundering the meagre resources of 
  the country as ministers, bureaucrats and NGO operators (&quot;smooth operators&quot;?) 
  is the mother of all terror in Bangladesh. Unless we realise that bank 
  defaulters, corrupt governments, bureaucrats and military, industrialists, 
  traders, NGO operators have been resorting to terror by plundering and 
  depriving the state and people of their due, the recent bombings are just the 
  beginnings of the end of the status quo. </p>
  <p align="justify">One should not be that surprised that sections of the 
  frustrated, unemployed youth should be attracted to terror- &quot;Islamic&quot; or the 
  neo-fascist ones- as it has been happening elsewhere in the Third World. Any 
  attempt to portray terror as merely a political act of desperation or as a 
  by-product of some weird ideology (as George Bush and his team have been doing 
  since 9/11), without understanding the real economic issues behind it, will 
  remain counter-productive, hence useless. </p>
  <p align="justify">Now, let us evaluate what local and international &quot;experts&quot; 
  and amateur analysts have so far analysed about the Dhaka bombing of August 
  21. Their collective analyses have so far identified six possible sources of 
  terror in Bangladesh: </p>
  <p align="justify">1) The Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islamiya; 2) A section of the 
  ambitious military officers in Bangladesh armed forces having extreme 
  ideological commitment to &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot;; 3) The underground Maoist 
  rebels; 4) The RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) of India; 5) The ISI 
  (Inter-Services Intelligence) of Pakistan; 6) The ruling BNP-Islamist 
  Coalition of Bangladesh. </p>
  <p align="justify">None of the analysts have given any thought over the 
  economic and class dimensions of the problem. Another aspect of terror is its 
  positive correlation with the anger and frustration of the perpetrators, who 
  are motivated to terrorizing to register their anger and hatred towards their 
  perceived enemies. The analysts so far have failed to identify these 
  socio-economic and psychological dimensions of terror. To them, the problem is 
  simply a political/ideological one. And this sort of analysis is the biggest 
  problem towards understanding terror, both global and regional. </p>
  <p align="justify">However, the organized and professional nature of the 
  grenade attacks on the Awami League rally, most definitely to eliminate Sheikh 
  Hasina physically, by no stretch of the imagination were acts of mindless 
  group of terrorists adopting terror just for the sake of it as fanatics or 
  anarchists would do. The August 21 bombing and the scores of previous attacks 
  which killed and maimed innocent people in different parts of the country 
  during the last eight years or so were organized acts of terror to discredit 
  both the Awami League and BNP. Politically ambitious group of people must have 
  been exploiting the socio-economic situation, using underdogs in the name of 
  an ideology. The precision and professionalism of the killers, especially of 
  the August 21st,are very ominous, indicative of a grand scheme of eventual 
  takeover of the country by the group. </p>
  <p align="justify">The oversimplified analyses, based on wild conjectures, 
  subjectivity, prejudice and malice towards political adversaries, are 
  problematic and unhelpful towards our understanding of the problem. The 
  over-politicization of the attacks-both by the ruling and opposition parties- 
  will not bring rich dividends but disaster for Bangladesh. </p>
  <p align="justify">The one-point programme of the Awami League, to remove the 
  BNP and Khaleda Zia from power, in the wake of the bombing is further divisive 
  and would only benefit the terrorists. A divisive and sharply polarized polity 
  would be the ideal breeding ground for more terror. </p>
  <p align="justify">Now, to turn to the various theorists as to who were 
  involved in the attacks, the most acceptable theory is that some shadowy 
  Islamist group might have been involved in the attacks. However, one cannot be 
  that precise about which group of &quot;Islamic&quot; terrorists are behind such 
  attacks. It is difficult to accept some Indian analysts' version of the story 
  that some Jamaat-i-Islami leaders in Bangladesh having links with Al-Qaeda 
  and/or some Rohingya or Assamese-Meghalaya Muslim separatist groups, said to 
  have strong commitment to &quot;Brihot&quot; or greater Bangladesh, have been 
  terrorizing Bangladesh. This group of terrorists, according to the theory, 
  were trained and armed by Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Chittagong Hill Tracts. 
  The group, known as Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islamiya, having 15,000 trained 
  guerrillas, have links with Jamaat-i-Islami of Bangladesh, so goes the story.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">Meanwhile, another Islamic group, Hikmatul Jihad (hitherto 
  unheard of) claimed its involvement in the recent attacks on Sheikh Hasina 
  through an email to the editor of a Bengali daily in Dhaka. The police are 
  said to have traced the sender of the email and have already arrested and 
  interrogated the suspect, an unemployed Hindu youth from Dhaka. If finally 
  something substantial emerges out of these interrogations of Partha, who had 
  his university education in India, that would give an altogether new dimension 
  to the story. Those who believe in Indian hands in terrorist acts in 
  Bangladesh would go farther in their renunciation of the country. </p>
  <p align="justify">There is no denying of the fact that India has hardly been 
  benevolent and generous towards its immediate neighbors in the last fifty odd 
  years. It is also true that India is possibly the only country in the world 
  besides Israel having bad to very bad relationship with all its immediate 
  neighbors, including Bangladesh. This, however, does not justify someone's 
  finger pointing at India for the recent bombings in Dhaka unless one has 
  concrete evidence to prove so. </p>
  <p align="justify">Some Indian analysts as well as their Bangladeshi 
  counterparts are responsible for this sort of oversimplifications. Jaideep 
  Saikia in his recent research paper on Islamic resurgence in eastern India has 
  unnecessarily provoked some Bangladeshi analysts. Saikia has not only 
  questioned the loyalty of Indian Muslims living in Assam, Meghalaya and 
  adjoining states but has also inadvertently provoked some Bangladeshi 
  scholars. Saikia has cited Mujibur Rahman Khan's book, &quot;Eastern Pakistan: Its 
  Population, Delimitation and Economics&quot;, published by the East Pakistan 
  Renaissance Society from Calcutta in 1944 where the author wanted the 
  incorporation of Assam into Eastern Pakistan. Saikia has mistakenly taken 
  Mujibur Rahman Khan (a journalist and Muslim League leader in the 1940s) to be 
  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and this has created some confusion and controversy 
  among several Bangladeshi scholars. Nothing could be more amateurish than 
  tracing Islamic revival and terror in eastern India and Bangladesh to the 
  politics of the 1940s. </p>
  <p align="justify">From the professional nature of the grenade attacks in 
  broad daylight it appears that these terrorists are trained military 
  personnel. This has tempted some analysts to assume that a section of the 
  Bangladesh armed forces under the influence of Al-Qaeda or Jamaat-i-Islami 
  (amateur analysts often confuse the two) wanted to kill Sheikh Hasina with a 
  view to creating chaos and a political vacuum, eventually to install an 
  Islamic military government in the country. This is a bit far fetched as 
  neither the US nor the average Bangladeshis would welcome a military 
  governemnt let alone a pro-Taliban regime in Bangladesh. </p>
  <p align="justify">The weak and divided remnants of the Maoist groups of the 
  1970s are the least likely perpetrators of the August 21st carnage. No body 
  has yet traced any such professionally trained Maoist guerrilla group in the 
  region. Even the Nepalese Maoists have recently been forced to fight a 
  defensive war and are retreating. </p>
  <p align="justify">Only extremely immoderate and politically biased people 
  would point finger at the ruling coalition for the attacks on Sheikh Hasina. 
  While the BNP-led coalition has two more years to rule (ruling parties have 
  all the due and undue privileges, and opportunities in countries like 
  Bangladesh), why on earth it would jeopardise its own immediate future by 
  physically eliminating the leader of the opposition is beyond reason. The 
  death of Hasina would have signalled the death of Awami League as a party as 
  there are no acceptable successors to the matriarch (similar is the situation 
  in BNP), but Hasina's violent death would have also brought a mass upsurge, 
  big enough to topple the BNP governemnt. </p>
  <p align="justify">As India card is not worth playing here to link RAW or some 
  other agencies with the terrorist attacks in Bangladesh, only die-hard 
  fanatics and amateurs would suspect Pakistan to be the culprit in this regard. 
  As India has absolutely nothing to gain by destroying the Awami League (widely 
  known as &quot;pro-Indian&quot;), Pakistan hardly bothers about Bangladesh and its 
  internal problems as Pakistan has so many of its own. </p>
  <p align="justify">In sum, as there is no easy answer to the question as to 
  who bombed the Awami League rally to kill Sheikh Hasina, there is no easy 
  solution to the problem of terrorism in Bangladesh and elsewhere. There are 
  global as well as regional/local problems, grave enough to germinate terrorist 
  cells and groups. Only the rule of law and equi-distribution of wealth and 
  opportunities under a relatively corruption free system can ensure stability 
  and peace. Terrorism is not a disease but a symptom while corruption and 
  misrule are manifestations of the virus, which breeds terrorism.</p>
