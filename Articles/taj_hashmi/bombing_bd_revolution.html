  <b><font face="Verdana" color="#6FB1D9">Published
	on
	July 20, 2005</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is very disturbing indeed, that 
	two innocent people died, hundreds wounded and millions terrorized by a 
	spate of synchronized bombing in 63 out of the 64 district towns of 
	Bangladesh, including the capital Dhaka, in the morning of 17th August 
	between 10:30 and 11:30 am. Around 400 “home-made” bombs, with not-so-crude 
	electric timers, came off in government offices, court houses, public parks, 
	universities, airport, and shopping centres and on roadsides. Although the 
	number of dead and injured is relatively smaller, in comparison to the toll 
	of roadside bombs in Iraq, yet the message is very clear, ominously 
	frightening for those who do not want Bangladesh turn “Islamic” or instable 
	for an indefinite period. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most alarming part of the story 
	is not the first most synchronized bombing in history, at 400-odd places, 
	but the widely perceived assumption of direct involvement of some 
	clandestine Islamist group having links with Al Qaeda in the bombing. 
	Leaflets in Bengali, and surprisingly in Arabic, were found nearby, which 
	conveyed an ominous message in the name of the Jamaatul Mujahedeen 
	Bangladesh (JMB), a party of holy warriors: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“People who are against Allah are 
	now running the country. The process, under which the head of the state and 
	other officials are elected, is not in accordance with the Islamic rule. 
	Neither the Koran nor the Hadis approves democracy or secularism, formulated 
	by Kafirs [non-believers] and Mushriks [pagans].” It calls upon the 
	Government and all the political parties of the country to abandon democracy 
	and adopt the Sharia or Islamic code. “Otherwise, the organization will 
	resort to Qital [all-out killing] for the establishment of the rules of 
	Allah on His land,” is the message in the most unequivocal expression. It 
	also prescribes severe punishment for George W. Bush, “the biggest terrorist 
	in the world”, and Tony Blair and their local supporters in Bangladesh, 
	including those who run NGOs and work for the government. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The shadowy JMB, banned earlier by 
	the Government for terrorizing people in certain pockets of northwestern 
	Bangladesh under the leadership of one “Bangla Bhai”, drew the attention of 
	New York Times correspondent, Eliza Griswold in early this year (“The Next 
	Islamist Revolution?” January 23, 2005). Griswold is not the first Western 
	reporter to draw such an alarmist picture of Bangladesh. In April 2002, 
	Bertil Lintner wrote a similar piece in the Far Eastern Economic Review and 
	the Wall Street Journal, that an “Islamic revolution” was in the offing in 
	this poor, overpopulated and the most corrupt country in the world. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, the then US ambassador Mary 
	Anne Peters registering her anger at the FEER and WSJ for publishing such 
	biased articles on “a liberal Muslim nation” demanded an investigation to 
	find out the motive behind the story. Philip Bowring, former editor of the 
	FEER, also came forward to criticize the Western “Islam-bashers”, including 
	Dow Jones, who owns the periodical. Many Bangladeshi academics, journalists 
	and politicians condemned both Lintner and Griswold for their stories. The 
	Government continued denying the existence of any “Bangla Bhai” and his 
	terrorist gang for quite some time. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the arrest of some workers of 
	several clandestine Islamist groups by the Government, including Dr 
	Asadullah Ghalib, a university professor and one of the top leaders of the 
	JMB, there have been sporadic bomb attacks on public rallies, movie theatres 
	and Muslim shrines since early 2005. Attacks on the minority Ahmadiya Muslim 
	mosques and properties and demands to declare the community “non-Muslim” 
	have become endemic as well. Several politicians died of bomb attacks. The 
	present British High Commissioner and Sheikh Hasina, former Prime Minister 
	and leader of the opposition, narrowly survived grenade attacks in public 
	places during the last one year. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From police interrogations of more 
	than a hundred arrested suspects of the latest bomb attacks, mostly 
	connected with the JMB, it appears that more than 1500 JMB activists planted 
	the bombs with a view to pressuring the Government to release their mentor, 
	Dr Ghalib, and to warn both the ruling and the main secular opposition 
	parties of the dire consequences of not establishing a Sharia-based 
	government in the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The JMB is just the youth front of 
	the global jihadi network of Al Mujahideen. There are scores of branches and 
	offshoots of the parent organization in Bangladesh. They often take new 
	names and banners to evade arrest and detection. The Harkatul Jihad, Hizbut 
	Tawheed and Shahadat-i-Hikmah have been some of the offshoots since the 
	mid-1990s. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is widely known that several 
	ruling party law makers and a minister are directly connected with some of 
	the militants in northwestern Bangladesh. It is widely believed that 
	Islamists of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (and most probably Taliban sympathizers 
	from Pakistan) have been indoctrinating, arming and financing the JMB for 
	quite some time. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The sharp polarization of the polity 
	between the so-called secular “pro-Independence” and the not-so-secular 
	“Islam-loving” groups has been a contributing factor in the Islamization of 
	the country. Both the “secular” group under Sheikh Hasina and the “Islam 
	loving” group under prime minister Khaleda Zia have been championing the 
	cause of Islam ever since the overthrow of military dictatorship in 1990. It 
	seems, as if the two major parties, Hasina’s Awami League and Khaleda’s BNP, 
	have been competing with each other to prove their Islamic credentials with 
	a view to securing more votes from the God-fearing Bengali Muslims. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Meanwhile, President Ziaur Rahman 
	had formally scrapped “Secularism” and “Socialism” from the Constitution. 
	His successor, General Ershad further Islamized the polity by making Islam 
	the “state religion” through an amendment of the Constitution in 1988.Three 
	successive governments under Khaleda and Hasina since 1991 could neither 
	restore “Secularism” as enshrined in the original Constitution, nor scrap 
	the “state religion” amendment. Realizing the political importance of Islam 
	in this backward and predominantly Muslim country, no major political party 
	champions the cause of secularism by scrapping the “state religion” clause 
	from the Constitution. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems, the biggest stumbling 
	block in the way of secularism is the popular culture of the vast majority 
	of the population. Since the immediate post-independence government of 
	Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (1972-75), regarded by many as the founding father of 
	the nation, miserably failed in delivering the promised poverty free, 
	prosperous Bangladesh in a “secular” and “socialist” authoritarian 
	democracy, most Bangladeshis have become suspicious of secularism and 
	socialism. And while democracy has remained elusive, the average Bangladeshi 
	Muslim has remained loyal to traditional Islamic and authoritarian values. 
	The changed circumstances of the post-Cold War era – the disappearance of 
	the Soviet style socialism and the advent of market economy and 
	Globalization – also brought Islam in the arena of global politics. This 
	time it appeared not as an ally but as an adversary of the hegemonic West, 
	mainly represented by the US and its allies. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islamism in Bangladesh has 
	similarities with its counterparts in Muslim majority countries like 
	Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan and Indonesia. All of them had gone through secular 
	National Socialism and autocracies under civil/military rulers before 
	turning Islamic during the last decade and a half. Islamism in these 
	countries may be attributed to the failure of the promised welfare state 
	under pseudo-socialism or corrupt and inefficient state capitalism. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although Bangladesh emerged as a 
	symbol of freedom and equality, unfortunately, it is only symbolic and 
	historical as since its emergence in 1971, the rich are getting richer, and 
	the poor are getting poorer, far faster than anywhere in South Asia. Around 
	50% of the population is very poor and more than 35% are practically 
	unemployed. The tax evading rich, the absolutely corrupt politicians, 
	bureaucracy and thousands of bank defaulters have accumulated more than $60 
	billion in “black money” since 1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While the rich and powerful get 
	their children educated in English medium schools, at home and abroad, and 
	are the most employable in the country, the fast disappearing middle class 
	send their children to Bengali medium schools and the poor mostly send their 
	children to Islamic seminaries called madrasas. Besides the stream of the 
	under-employed Bengali medium graduates are millions of 
	unemployed/underemployed madrasa graduates. No wonder, sections of these 
	frustrated, angry young men have swelled the ranks of the Islamist 
	militants, including the ultra-extremist JMB. The situation is very similar 
	to what Algeria and Afghanistan have been experiencing, the class war 
	between the Western (secular) and vernacular (Islamic) elites. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islamists’ anger and frustration are 
	reflected in their demand for the introduction of the Sharia law, which has 
	several dimensions. Firstly, the demand smacks of their desire to go back to 
	the utopian Islamic past in the 7th century, presumed to be an era of peace, 
	justice, prosperity and tolerance. Secondly, besides its spiritual aspect, a 
	Sharia-based state would employ mullahs as law makers, judges, teachers and 
	administrators. So, the demand for a Sharia-based administration has pure 
	and simple secular logic. One has reasons to agree with a Western scholar 
	that the ongoing Islamist movements in the world reflect the adherents’ 
	desire for modernity. It is too trite an assumption that all Islamic 
	movements, including the militant ones, are backward looking, anti-modern.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those who think that there is 
	something inherent in the Islamic scripture conducive to the growth of 
	terror, should ask themselves as to why “Islamic terror” did not disturb the 
	world peace during the 700 years between the crushing defeat of the Ismaili 
	Assassins and the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. There is likelihood of missing 
	the forest due to trees. Explaining “Islamic terror” only in terms of 
	cultural, political and social factors is inaccurate and subjective. 
	Unfortunately, the most relevant economic factor is missing in most analyses 
	of “Islamic terror” in Bangladesh and beyond. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is no denying that thousands 
	of ultra-extremist Islamists do exist in Bangladesh along with millions of 
	frustrated youths, some resigned to their miserable fate while others 
	engaged in criminal activities. However, the mere existence of Islamist 
	terrorists in a country does not necessarily lead to an Islamic Revolution. 
	One may apply Lenin’s classic theory of revolution in rejecting the 
	over-simplified, alarmist views of Lintner, Griswold and others, with regard 
	to their “impending Islamic Revolution” theses. According to Lenin, there 
	are three prerequisites for a revolution: a) mass discontent; b) gradual 
	infiltration of ideas and c) a weak government. A well-organized party to 
	lead the people is also a requirement. The partial existence of only the 
	first and second prerequisites does not make Bangladesh a good candidate for 
	an Islamic Revolution at all. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Without going into details of Iran, 
	the Sudan and Afghanistan with regard to their respective Islamic 
	Revolutions, the existence of a free press, the semblance of democracy, the 
	existence of scores of Islamic organizations having diverse views, and above 
	all, almost the total disregard for the mullah as their potential rulers by 
	more than 90 per cent of the voters (as reflected in all the parliamentary 
	elections during the last 35 years), Islamists have absolutely no hope of 
	staging a revolution or a sustainable military coup d’etat. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, what is possible and most 
	likely is the recurrence of terrorist attacks in the future. And if the 
	terrorists this time decide to use more lethal bombs, one can well imagine 
	the level of destruction. Unless the “liberal democratic” parties and most 
	importantly, the civil society come forward in unison to fight extremism 
	instead of calling names and vilifying each other as “terrorists and 
	murderers”, there is no remedy against terrorism. The most important step in 
	this regard would be taken to narrow the widening gap between the rich and 
	poor. Only lip service to secularism will not de-terrorize the already 
	terrorized polity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, since Islamist terrorism is 
	a global factor, its symptoms cannot be eliminated in Bangladesh unless 
	there is a global attempt to contain it. Turning a blind eye to the 
	systematic extortion and disempowerment of the poor in the name of 
	development and empowerment, by the government, traders/industrialists and 
	the donor-sponsored rapacious mega NGOs will not improve the situation. 
	Perpetual terror, Islamic or in any other name, will perpetuate poverty and 
	dependency in Bangladesh. </font></p>
