	Civil-Military Authorities of Bangladesh </font></p>
	<p></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="4"><a href="index.html">Taj Hashmi</a></font>
	</p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dear Sirs / Madams: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since we have been getting mixed and 
	ambivalent, hence confusing statements, from several top members of the 
	civil-military administration of Bangladesh, including the Chief Adviser, 
	Law Adviser and the Army Chief, about the nature of the present government 
	(whether it is “military-backed”, a “civilian”, a quasi-military, or a 
	purely military regime with a civilian façade), I am addressing both the 
	civil and military authorities to draw their attention to a very important 
	matter. This is about the deteriorating civil-military relations in 
	Bangladesh , with special reference to the ongoing harassment and 
	manhandling of several university teachers and students by the police and 
	not-so-surprising, by members of the armed forces. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As an expatriate Bangladeshi (and a 
	former faculty member of Dhaka University ) I just cannot accept this 
	unwarranted, wantonly uncivil and barbaric behaviour of law-enforcers and 
	defenders of the country. You have not only flagrantly violated all norms of 
	civility, decency and the rule of law by arresting (and torturing under 
	unlawful custody) several university professors and students on specious 
	grounds, misleading information and fallaciously deceptive arguments, 
	implicating them in “anti-state activities”, but you have also tarnished the 
	image of Bangladesh, which is now (thanks to your rash acts) not that 
	different from a country under civil / military dictatorship. By arresting 
	university teachers for their alleged incitement of students to go against 
	military rule you have simply followed the inglorious precedents of Ne Win, 
	Suharto, Marcos, Saddam Hussein, the last Shah of Iran and Yahya Khan. Even 
	the military regime of Ayub Khan was much more liberal, benign and civil in 
	comparison to your civil-military oligarchy, especially with regard to what 
	you have done so far to several university teachers and students (and are 
	planning to do more in the near future). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Without being an apologist, I can 
	say a score of not-so-pleasant things about my former colleagues at 
	Bangladeshi universities. Surely, they are not the epitomes of glory, 
	virtue, honesty and scholarship. But MOST DEFINITELY they represent the most 
	educated, most enlightened, most patriotic, most civilized, most 
	conscientious and most honest sections of the population in the country. Had 
	university (college and school) teachers and students been apathetic, 
	conformist or even indifferent to the right causes at the right time, there 
	would not have been any Bangladesh . </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, what I would like this 
	civil-military, quasi-military or whatever / whoever is running the country 
	to take some lesson from history, from our not-so-ancient history. Please 
	never ever forget that whoever persecuted university teachers and students 
	(especially of Dhaka University ), never ever achieved anything better for 
	themselves or for their regimes. One may in this regard mention the names of 
	two dictators, one Pakistani and one Bangladeshi, Yahya and Ershad, 
	respectively. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I would request you for the sake of 
	Bangladesh to contemplate and mull over as to why thousands of college and 
	university students came out on the street protesting the mal-treatment of a 
	few Dhaka University students by members of the armed forces. Even if your 
	allegations are not totally baseless, that some Dhaka University teachers 
	had instigated their students and colleagues at the DU and other 
	universities to demonstrate against the covert presence of the military in 
	running the country, you should try to figure out what has gone wrong that 
	thousands of students can be mobilized against your government despite your 
	doing so many good things to restore the rule of law in Bangladesh. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I personally believe that your 
	government has achieved so many good things in a short span of time, such as 
	arresting some big and powerful absolutely corrupt people. I do not think 
	any other government would have been able to demolish the illegally built 
	Rangs Tower . But at the same time, I have difficulties in believing that 
	your government could be that mindless to arrest, persecute and harass 
	university teachers and students, only because they do not accept you as 
	legitimate or desirable. I do not think these teachers and students 
	represent the majority of their peers. Even if they do not carry the 
	majority support, your going against them out of sheer vengeance is neither 
	civil nor in consonance with your avowed promise to restore democracy in the 
	country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I hope that good sense would prevail 
	and the military (and police) would learn to understand and respect 
	university teachers, students and everybody else, without undermining their 
	patriotism, honesty and integrity. I want you to get rid of the colonial and 
	Pakistani hangover that university teachers’ direct involvement in politics 
	is detrimental to the best interests of the country. I believe some members 
	of this government are aware that university teachers throughout the 
	civilized world take active role in politics. In Singapore , some of my 
	former colleagues at the National University simultaneously held their 
	university jobs and worked as elected members of the parliament. There is 
	nothing abhorrent about politics; it is not another four-letter word. A 
	de-politicized society is not that different from a de-humanized human 
	being. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You should appreciate university 
	teachers’ direct and indirect involvement in country’s politics as a 
	positive sign of progress and development, especially because most of our 
	politicians are not as educated as university teachers. What you should be 
	rather doing, instead of arresting university professors for indulging in 
	politics, is prohibiting any political role for active members of the 
	military, police and civil bureaucracy, with immediate effect. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nothing could be more disastrous 
	than considering the military and police as the only efficient and patriotic 
	institutions by undermining intellectuals and members of the civil society 
	as unpatriotic and uncivil. This sort of anti- and pseudo-intellectual 
	attitude only smacks of one’s inferiority complex, arrogance and ignorance. 
	I hope and pray this government would not suffer from this sort of 
	debilitating, self-glorifying narcissism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, I would request you to 
	release all the teacher and student arrested in the recent past in the wake 
	of a silly scuffle between some soldiers and DU students at a soccer match. 
	Further arrests of university teachers and students and issuance of warrants 
	of arrest would be simply disastrous for both the country and government in 
	the long-run. Meanwhile, you should publicly apologize to the nation for 
	arresting and harassing university teachers and students and punish those 
	responsible for this heinous crime. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I wish you good luck and hope decent 
	civil-military relations will prevail in the country for a smooth transition 
	to good governance and democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
