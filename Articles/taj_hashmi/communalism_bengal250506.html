	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="3">This paper aims at 
	shedding light on the frequently misunderstood phenomenon called 
	“communalism”, inherently a South Asian _expression connoting much more than 
	its actual meaning implying something very ominous and nasty, in colonial 
	Bengal. This &nbsp;perennial conflict mainly between the Hindu and Muslim 
	communities, supposed to have originated because of the differences in the 
	rituals, beliefs and practices of the two communities, not before but during 
	the British colonial rule, has not died out in independent India and 
	Bangladesh. </font></span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="3">As laymen are baffled as 
	to why Hindus and Muslims have been fighting or showing disrespect to each 
	other’s faith, rituals, norms, behaviour or anything associated with the 
	“other”, so are some social scientists, including historians. They associate 
	the problem with religiosity, lack of secular and modern education, and 
	intolerance of the people concerned bred by some religious texts, the <i>
	Quran </i>or the <i>Vagbad Geeta</i>, depending on who are explaining the 
	enigmatic phenomenon called communal conflict, hatred and antagonism. 
	Contrary to the laymen understanding and lopsided analyses by scholars, 
	journalists and politicians, had religiosity of the people or the alleged 
	hateful teachings of the religious texts been responsible for communalism, 
	then the pre-British (and pre-modern) Mughal period would have witnessed 
	thousands of rioting and embittered Hindu-Muslim relationship. 
	Interestingly, history records only a few sporadic Hindu-Muslim clashes 
	during the Holi Festival in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century under the 
	Mughals.</font></span></p>

	the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Jawaharlal Nehru, a non-communal, agnostic 
	politician and the first prime minister of India, who would have been famous 
	for his scholarship alone, feels that what is “nationalism” for the majority 
	community becomes “communalism” when the minorities do similar things to

	Badruddin Umar’s tireless effort to distinguish between 
	chauvinism/nationalism and communalism since the 1960s, especially through 
	his books, <i>Sampradayikata </i>and <i>Sangskritik Sampradayikata,</i> has 
	gone down the drains. Hence the tendency to lump together all forms of 
	racial, linguistic and religious discriminations and prejudices of the 
	majority communities against the minorities into the amorphous “<i>laddu</i>”

	period for asserting majority Bengali separatism), cannot be “communal”, so 
	are Hitler, Advani, Khaleda, Mujib, Tagore or Sarat Chatterjee. They 
	were/are German, Hindu, Muslim or Bengali nationalists. And as someone’s 
	“terrorist” is a “freedom fighter” to others, similarly, the minority

	the majority community. </font></span></p>

	classifies Tagore or Chattejees (both Bankim and Sarat). If one considers 
	them as members of the majority Hindu community of the Subcontinent, then 
	they were “nationalists” albeit of the pejorative “Hindu chauvinistic” type. 
	The moment one classifies them as members of the “minority Hindu community 
	of Bengal”, then all three of them (despite their literary genius and kind 
	words for Muslims, reflected in their literary writings) were nothing but 
	arch communal hate-mongers and Hindu separatists. We must draw a line 
	between “Hindu/Muslim supremacist” and “Hindu/Muslim separatist” – the 
	former being nationalist/chauvinist and the latter communal/separatist.</font></span></p>

	elaborated, one does not have to be “religiously ardent, tepid or cold; 
	orthodox, liberal or atheist; righteous or vicious” to be classified as 
	“communal”, both communalism of the minority and chauvinism of the majority 
	communities are by-products of economic, religious and psychological factors 
	[p.187]. The adherents of supremacist/exclusionist ideology and the 
	separatist minorities are again subject to false consciousness, vainglory 
	and narrow class/group interest. As members of the Muslim minority community 
	in colonial India nourished the wrong ideology of extra-territoriality, 
	considering themselves as descendants of “foreigners” from the Middle East 
	and Central Asia, members of the majority Hindu community, quite expediently 
	accepted their false credentials to marginalize them as “foreigners”. Smith 
	is worth quoting again: “Hinduism has never outgrown its tribalism; has 
	never aspired or claimed to be anything higher than the religion of a group, 
	or rather a series of sub-groups eternalized in the caste system. To the 
	Hindu, every Indian who is a Muslim is an outcast out-caste, an Untouchable 
	with whom dealings must not be so intimate as to transgress certain formal 
	rules. This exclusion is religious; but with Hinduism ‘religious’ means 
	‘social’ in a highly evolved traditional way” <i>&nbsp;</i>pp.189-90].</font></span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="3">The socio-economic base of 
	communalism in undivided Bengal was different from that of northwestern 
	India. Similarly the northwest was almost totally different from South India 
	in this regard. While the Punjab, UP, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and 
	Bengal witnessed intense communal hatred, tension and occasional mass 
	killing and rioting during the 1870s and 1950s, the coastal regions of the 
	Subcontinent (excepting Calcutta and Chittagong) in Bombay and Madras 
	Presidencies were almost totally immune to such barbarism. Does this mean 
	the Hindus and Muslims of Bombay and Madras were/are less religious, having 
	little sense of belonging to their respective communities? We know that is 
	not the case. The reason behind Hindus and Muslims living in much more peace 
	and harmony in the South than their co-religionists did/do in the North is 
	their learning English and supporting and opposing the British Raj together.

	the first hundred-odd years while the bulk of the Muslims were fighting and 
	non-cooperating with the British up to the 1870s and later they reversed 
	their role. Henceforth the bulk of the Hindus joined the anti-British 
	nationalist movement, opposing and non-cooperating with the Raj, while the 
	vast majority of Muslims started collaborating with the British (imitating 
	what their Hindu neighbours had done earlier), learning English for upward

	Mahmud, and about 600 years of Muslim rule in India are either influenced by 
	British colonial historiography, which not only portrays Babar as the 
	“demolisher” of a temple at Ayodhya and Awrangzeb as the “anti-Hindu bigot” 
	but also depicts the British Raj as the epitome of benevolence, tolerance 
	and justice. Besides the selective use of history by both Hindus and 
	Muslims, the crux of the problem lay with the unequal socio-economic and 
	political developments of the two communities, which mainly contributed to 
	the growth of mutual mistrust, hatred, prejudice and rivalries in every

	settlement with revenue collecting officials, known as Zamindars, turned 
	them into landlords in the British sense of the _expression, whose liability 
	to the Government (90% of the revenue collected in an estate) was fixed 
	permanently. The monstrosity of the absurd land system ( “a caricature of 
	British land system”, to paraphrase Karl Marx) was that while the Zamindar’s 
	liability to the Government was fixed permanently for generations, the 
	tenant’s liability (the rent obligation) to the Zamindar remained flexible, 
	turning him almost into a slave of&nbsp; his Zamindar. On top of the rent, the 
	Zamindar could extract illegal duties or taxes (abwab) from his tenants 
	whenever he needed extra cash to buy an elephant, to celebrate a wedding, 
	child birth, or to perform certain rituals or for self-gratifications, sheer 
	greed and caprice. </font></span></p>

	“Muslims”. The fast transfer of &nbsp;trading and industrial capital to Zamindari

	rapacious traders, moneylenders and speculators as Zamindars. They were much

	not long after the disaster of Plassey in 1757. By the 1850s, most of the

	traders and Zamindars, who had the cash and government patronage, bought off 
	these acquired estates to the chagrin and anger of the wretched Muslim

	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="3">The period between 1905 
	and 1947 witnessed the bitterest Hindu-Muslim antagonism and conflicts in 
	Bengal. With direct British support (which was in line with their colonial 
	divide-and-rule policy) and patronage, Bengali Muslims started collaborating 
	with the British as they rightly visualized the advantages of their 
	socio-political and economic uplift through collaboration with the British. 
	Hindu aristocrats, professionals, intellectuals, clerks, teachers, 
	shopkeepers, money-lenders in general were very unhappy with the British as 
	they were no longer willing to play the second fiddle as their subjects. By 
	then Muslims had experienced bitter Hindu chauvinism, both within and 
	outside Bengal. Hindu revivalist Arya Samaj and Hindu opposition to Urdu in 
	favour of Hindi (even by men like Lala Lajpat Rai who could not read and 
	write Hindi but Urdu) had already alarmed non-communal Sir Sayyid Ahmad 
	Khan, who once identified himself as a Hindu (“Muslim-Hindu” as he was born 
	in India or Hind) and considered Hindu and Muslim as two eyes of India. The 
	anti-Partition (1905-11) Swadeshi Movement, which directly promoted Hindu 
	revival and perpetuation of Muslim subjugation in Bengal by Hindu 
	super-ordinates further embittered the Hindu-Muslim relationship. The Hindu 
	opposition to the Dhaka University proposal, by men like Ashutosh Mukherjee 
	and Rabindranath Tagore, and their constantly vociferous opposition to&nbsp; any 
	attempt to grant more rights to Bengal peasants through amendments of the 
	Bengal Tenancy Act during 1923-38, the Free Rural Primary Education Bill, 
	the Money-lenders Bill in the 1930s and 1940s sharply polarized the two 
	communities both within and outside the Bengal legislature. Fazlul Huq, 
	Maulana Bhashani, H.S. Suhrawardy, Khwaja Nazimuddin, Abul Hashim, Nawab 
	Salimullah and Sir Abdur Rahim, among others, championed the Muslim/peasant 
	cause and Hindu politicians, professionals, intellectuals and journalists 
	openly promoted Zamindar-Bhadralok-Mahajan interests to the detriment of 
	Muslims/peasants up to the Partition of 1947.</font></span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="3">In view of the above, 
	there is no truth in the assertion that the anti-Muslim communal rhetoric 
	of&nbsp; Bankim, Tagore and Sarat were in reaction to the communal stand of the 
	Muslim League or M.A. Jinnah. While Bankim glorified Hindutva in the 1880s, 
	Tagore did so with subtlety during the first thirty years of the 20<sup>th</sup> 
	century and Sarat Chatterjee advocated the expulsion of Muslims from India 
	in 1926, long before Chaudhry Rahmat Ali coined the term “Pakistan” in 1934 
	and the so-called Pakistan Resolution of March 1940. It is absolutely 
	incorrect to ascribe his anti-Muslim speech at a Hindu Mahasbha rally to the 
	Hindu-Muslim rioting at Pabna in 1926. The Pabna rioting was short-lived and 
	much smaller in scale than the Calcutta rioting, which preceded the former. 
	Pakistan demand could not be a cause for rioting rather it was an 
	unfortunate effect of Hindu Chauvinism and Muslim communalism/separatism. 
	And it may be mentioned that Jinnah was agreeable to the Cabinet Mission 
	Proposal of an Indian confederation till Nehru’s rejection of the proposal 
	in July 1946. So, Pakistan was by no means inevitable. Pakistan became 
	inevitable not because of the Punjab or UP Muslims’ desire for a separate 
	homeland. Pakistan became inevitable firstly because of Bengali Muslim 
	peasants’ desire to have better rights and opportunities. Another factor 
	behind the creation of Pakistan was Hindu elite’s desire to partition Bengal 
	after they realized that Bengali Muslims (children of the Chasha, many 
	graduated from the undesirable Dhaka University) would perpetually rule the 
	province by virtue of their number. </font></span></p>

	point in fabricating or relying on stories about Suhrawardy’s and Sheikh 
	Mujib’s instigating the Calcutta rioting of 1946-47 as there are credible 
	evidences to the contrary. There are documentary evidences, including 
	Suhrawardy’s personal correspondence with Jinnah and Liaquat Ali in 1947 and 
	1948, which proves beyond any doubt that he tried his best to save both 
	Hindus and Muslims in Calcutta as well as Noakhali (which was again a noisy 
	tea-party in comparison to Great Calcutta Killing of 1946 and the Bihar 
	Carnage of 1947). What we see in Attenborough’s Gandhi, which portrays both 
	Jinnah and Suhrawardy with nothing but tar and what we read and hear about 
	the Noakhali rioting in most books mainly based on Congress and Mahasabha 
	owned newspaper reporting are grossly exaggerated accounts and fabrications. 
	Noakhali carnage was a brutal reaction to the Great Calcutta Killing of 
	August-September 1946. Mainly Bengali Muslim peasants and working classes 
	took part in the killing, raping and “forcible conversion” and marriage of 
	Hindu women in and around Chhagalnaiya Thana. Around 350 Hindus, many of 
	whom were money-lenders, got killed. Golam Sarwar, a local peasant leader 
	was the main agent provocateur. He lost his son-in-law who was a jute mill 
	worker in Calcutta, in the Calcutta rioting of 1946.</font></span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="3">In sum, Muslim communalism 
	and Hindu chauvinism in undivided Bengal were by-products of uneven growth 
	and development of the two communities, who historically lived in peace and 
	harmony throughout the Mughal period. The uneven growth and development of 
	the Muslim and Hindus of Bengal was mainly due to the divisive policy of the 
	British rulers and partially incidental on British policy of turning Bengali 
	traders and entrepreneurs into Zamindars to get rid of competitors from 
	Bengali capitalist classes for the benefit of British trade and industries. 
	The British policy of disbanding the pre-existing army and police and 
	replacing the Indian code with British law also hard hit Muslims in Bengal 
	(and elsewhere in India) as they were predominant in these professions under 
	the Mughals. Muslim arrogance and incapability to learn English due to 
	poverty also contributed to their backwardness. With the transfer of the 
	capital from Murshidabad to Calcutta, thousands of Muslim families from the 
	depopulated Murshidabad and Dhaka had to settle in rural areas as peasants 
	and destitute. The emergence of Calcutta as the new metropolis of Bengal 
	(and India) on the one hand signalled the rise of the Hindu professionals 
	and capitalist classes, mainly emanating from the beneficiaries of the 
	Permanent Settlement; and on the other, it also indicated the ruralisation 
	and pauperization of the hitherto dominant Muslim classes. The antagonistic 
	classes of Bengali Hindu “haves” and Muslim “have-nots” fought each other 
	for around two hundred years, the former to perpetuate their stronghold on 
	the political economy and the latter to create a new niche in the body 
	politic of Bengal (and India). They did not shy out from the prospect of 
	replacing the Hindu beneficiaries of the Permanent Settlement and British 
	rule either by reverting to the pre-British Muslim order or by establishing 
	their “peasant utopia” or Pakistan.</font></span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="3">In short, the events and 
	process leading to the “Great Divide” or the greatest tragedy for Bengal 
	after the disaster of Plassey to occur up to 1947 tell us how and why fear, 
	hatred, ignorance and prejudice, primarily produced and nourished by the 
	majority and adopted by the minority community with the machinations of the 
	vicious colonial rulers made the Partition inevitable and the hangover of 
	the past bitterness so heady and long-lasting. The un-equal “elite conflict” 
	between the rich and powerful Hindu beneficiaries of the Permanent 
	Settlement and the poor and weak Bengali Muslim victims of the Permanent 
	Settlement is the main theme of the story of Hindu chauvinism and Muslim 
	communalism in Bengal. Since the budding Bengali Muslim elite with <i>
	jotedar/talukdar</i> [rich peasants] background was too weak to withstand 
	the mighty <i>Zamindar-Bhadralok-Mahajan</i> triumvirate, they had to&nbsp; get 
	the patronage of the Urdu-speaking elite or the<i> ashraf</i>, from within 
	and outside Bengal. The <i>ashraf</i> also needed the <i>jotedar </i>support 
	to reach the middle and lower peasants (Muslim and Namasudra), especially on 
	the eve of the provincial elections of 1937, as by then the Government of 
	India Act of 1935 had enfranchised many well-to-peasants. Northwest Indian
	<i>ashraf</i>, under the leadership of charismatic Jinnah, in alliance with 
	the Nawab of Dhaka and other <i>ashraf</i> leaders of Bengal forged ties 
	with lower <i>ashraf </i>&nbsp;and Muslim <i>jotedar/talukdar</i> classes of East 
	Bengal. The <i>ulama</i> or Muslim theologians played an important role in 
	the&nbsp; <i>ashraf-jotedar </i>marriage (of convenience). Thus the Muslim <i>
	Ashraf-Ulama-Jotedar</i> triumvirate came into being to challenge the 
	powerful Hindu <i>Zamindar-Bhadralok-Mahajan</i> triumvirate.</font></span></p>

	towards them, the bulk of the Bengali peasants had first been communalized 
	and then politicized under the influence of the <i>ulama.</i> Hindu 
	opposition to cow slaughtering and treatment of Muslim peasants as “live 
	stock” and untouchables (to paraphrase Nirad Chaudhury,<i> Autobiography of

	Rajnitir Panchash Bachhar</i>, Dhaka 1970) thoroughly communalized the bulk 
	of Bengali Muslims by the 1920s. Afterwards under the influence of the 
	rustic mullah, Bengali Muslims learnt how to classify the Hindus as <i>kafir</i> 
	[non-believer], <i>mushrik</i> [polytheist] and <i>malaun</i> [the cursed 
	one or the Devil]. They also learn how to hate everything Hindu, including
