  Among Pygmies&nbsp;</b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4"><b><a href="index.html">Taj Hashmi</a></b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><b>Toronto</b></p>
  <p>I am so shocked and sad to hear this extremely bad news about the sudden
  demise of my very good old friend, Humayun Azad. I just cannot believe it. I
  am also so sad because despite my trying, I could not meet him last time I
  went to Dhaka in early May, this year. I was told, he was sleeping. And my
  dear friend is now sleeping for good.</p>
  <p>Humayun Azad was a maverick, a brave honest man with sharp intellect and
  concern for the fellow human being everywhere. He was a very interesting person,
  albeit opinionated, passionate about his ideas and thought, principles and
  policies, and above all, about his strong liking and disliking. As another
  maverick disciple of the great scholar, social thinker and political activist,
  the late Ahmed Sharif, my ideas and flippancy often clicked with those of Azad.
  Consequently during the last few years of my active teaching career at Dhaka
  University from 1977 (when Azad joined the Bengali Department) to 1981, when I
  left Bangladesh for higher education, we met almost every weekday during the
  pre-lunch &quot;adda&quot; at the teachers' lounge of the Arts Building with
  Ahmed Sharif the Great &quot;in chair&quot;. While Ahmed Sharif would be
  demolishing all the mythical &quot;intellectuals&quot; and politicians of the
  country giving vivid accounts of their corruption, disintegrity and opportunism;
  Azad and myself, along with a dozen or so colleagues from various departments,
  would be active participants-cum-listeners of the Voltaire of Bangladesh, the
  great Ahmed Sharif.</p>
  <p>In the evenings, almost everyday, I would encounter Azad at the Dhaka
  University Club across the chess board for hours together-most of the time he
  would be the winner-thanks to his intelligence and my lack of patience and
  intelligence in comparison to Azad. Actually, I first met him, a young
  well-dressed (I still remember his shiny pair of Clarke shoes) sharp Azad one
  evening at the Dhaka University Club, sitting next to me across the chess
  board. I was playing with another colleague and he was sitting next to us.
  Then we played a couple of games. And our mutual discoveries and friendship
  began. We never disrespected each other despite our disagreements. In those
  days of the late 1970s and early 1980s I used to write Bengali essays in
  popular journals and magazines while Azad would only write poems and would
  regard our essays on politics and culture, society and history not that
  useful. I still remember that big debate we had in presence of Professor Abul
  Kasem Fazlul Haque of Bangla Department. Then one day, not long after the
  debate, I wrote a couple of poems and read to him in presence of other
  colleagues in the Teachers' Lounge. My message was not so subtle and Azad
  realised it, enjoyed it and our friendship was further cemented.I am so glad
  that Azad later emerged as one of the most successful poets, essayists and
  scholars of Bangladesh.</p>
  <p>He was a pronounced atheist like our guru Ahmed Sharif, while I have been
  always a believer with total disdain for mullahs and mullahism. And I found
  both Ahmed Sharif and Humayun Azad more acceptable and admirable than most
  believing and practicing Muslims around me.</p>
  <p>We had another thing in common. We neither liked the Awami Baksalis nor the
  newly emerging BNP-Jamaatis among the Dhaka University faculty. Azad was a
  brave fellow traveler along with a few other colleagues and friends at Dhaka
  University. With hindsight, it seems he was the bravest among all of us. And
  possibly the most dangerous to the obscurantist &quot;Islamic&quot; fanatics
  and criminals. Both Bangladesh and Dhaka University have plenty of them. They
  are possibly having an orgasmic pleasure at the sad demise of their victim,
  the bold and brave Humayun Azad.</p>
  <p>He will be always missed by me. I am not sure if others will follow him in
  denouncing obscurantism, superstitions, corruption and anarchy in Bangladesh
  after the fanatics' success in eliminating this great soul. Finally, I pay my
  tribute to this great friend of mine with a note of optimism that the younger
  generation of Bangladesh will finally follow the path of Ahmed Sharif and
  Humayun Azad with the realisation that we cannot perpetually live by
  compromising with autocracy and anarchy. Autocrats and anarchists cannot be
  our friends. Unless we eliminate them with our concerted efforts, there is no
  shortcut to progress and liberation for the common people. In sum, Azad was
  &quot;a giant among pygmies&quot;. Both Azad and myself used this phrase in
  our obituaries of Ahmed Sharif (and we did not consult each other). I am using
  the expression again without consulting anybody as I believe in calling a
  spade a spade. Long live the memories of Humayun Azad.</p>
