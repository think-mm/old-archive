	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The dust has settled on the cricket 
	pitches in Bangladesh after the humiliating defeats of the home team by Sri 
	Lankans and Australians in a row and the average Bangladeshi has forgotten 
	the brutal massacre of innocent villagers at Kansat by Bangladeshi police in 
	the midst of the ongoing debate on reforming the unique (and absurd) 
	“Caretaker Government” to hold free and fair elections. This is an attempt 
	to visualize what has gone wrong with the entire polity in every sphere of 
	life through a prismatic compass. This apparently odd prism made of police 
	brutality (and mass apathy), cricket mania and political chaos shows us our 
	not-so-pleasant past, present and future. Witnessing the cricket fiasco and 
	the hyper politicking over reforming the election machinery while 
	Bangladeshi police were killing innocent villagers at Kansat is like 
	visiting a nihilistic world of anarchy and absurdity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What happened at Kansat, a rural 
	hinterland in northern Bangladesh, during January and April 2006 would have 
	toppled governments or at least brought about months long mammoth mass 
	demonstrations, general strikes and total non-cooperation with the 
	government for the brutal killing of twenty unarmed civilians everywhere in 
	the civilized world. What is interesting that predecessors of these inert 
	Bangladeshis on scores of occasions during the Pakistani period did never 
	shy out from coming out on the street protesting police and eventually 
	military brutalities on unarmed civilians, irrespective of their class and 
	background. One may mention how the killing of less than half a dozen Dhaka 
	University students by police firing on 21st February 1952 kept the millions 
	of Bengalis restive, agitating, assertive and angry for about two decades 
	against Pakistani ruling classes, which eventually led to the creation of 
	Bangladesh. Similarly in 1969, Bengalis took a vow to avenge the killing of 
	Asaduzzaman, Matiur Rahman, Dr Shamsuddoha and a few other Bengalis by 
	Pakistani police and military. Cricket or elite power politics could never 
	divert public attention from the real political issues of mass empowerment, 
	dignity and eventually, freedom. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Kansat Tragedy reveals most of 
	our problems by turning Bangladesh inside out. Firstly, it reveals how 
	neglected are the peasants and working classes in the psyche of the elites. 
	Peasants’ getting electricity and fuel to run irrigation pumps seems to be 
	the least important thing to them. Not only had the ruling coalition been 
	indifferent to the Kansat peasants’ demands for unhindered supply of 
	electricity and fuel, but the main opposition parties and the vast majority 
	of the urban middle and upper classes also been indifferent, if not hostile, 
	to their demands. From the general apathy of the vast majority of 
	Bangladeshi elites across the board during and in the aftermath of the 
	killing it appears that most of the elite never meant what they said about 
	the “liberation of the people” before and after the creation of Bangladesh.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What was most disgraceful for the 
	entire nation was the celebration of the “Kansat Victory” by the ruling 
	parties and the opposition after the so-called truce between aggrieved 
	villagers and the government. The government did not take any disciplinary 
	action against the killer policemen and yet everything seems to be normal 
	throughout the country. Some intellectuals have even portrayed the peasant 
	agitation and the subsequent brutal massacre of twenty-odd unarmed peasants 
	as a “peasant revolution”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The mass apathy towards the Kansat 
	Tragedy, excepting a few general strikes by not-yet-been-corrupted students, 
	indicates the state of mass de-politicization of the people. The vested 
	interest groups either brain wash and hegemonize mass consciousness in the 
	name of their parties or religion to keep them dormant/next 
	worldly/depoliticized or to activate them politically through phony and 
	divisive non-issues like “Bengali” versus “Bangladeshi” or “pro-” versus 
	“anti-Liberation”. Non-political distractions like playing Bangladesh in 
	test and one-day cricket matches against leading cricket teams of the world 
	have also been very efficacious in depoliticizing the masses. In short, 
	besides being a red herring, cricket in Bangladesh is also a political 
	football of the rival political elites. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One may find the simile, “political 
	football”, offensive and unpalatable. However, a look into the history of 
	cricket in the region reveals that contrary to the wrong perception, there 
	is nothing so new about cricket in Bangladesh. Bengali youths have been 
	playing the game at least since the 1860s while the game per se was 
	introduced to Bengal about a hundred years before its arrival into the 
	Punjab and Sri Lanka. So, the moment we see Bangladeshis over-celebrating 
	their extremely few and far between cricket victories, we know something has 
	gone wrong. One does not know how Bangladesh would celebrate a hypothetical 
	victory in series of test and one-day matches against all the leading teams 
	of the world in a year, including its winning the World Cup. We know the 
	abysmal state of the infrastructure – shortage of playgrounds, mass poverty 
	and lack of physical fitness of the vast majority of the population due to 
	low calorie intake – Bangladesh is most likely to remain an underdog in the 
	arena of games and sports. This, however, does not mean that one undermines 
	the Bangladeshi cricketers for achieving whatever they have achieved during 
	the past few years despite having so many problems and not having at least 
	500 cricket pitches for such a vast population. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is under review here is not the 
	state of cricket in the country but the political rhetoric and the psyche of 
	the nation as developed during the last decades vis-à-vis the sport. The 
	wild celebrations smacked of only the collective sense of disproportion and 
	inferiority complex of the polity. Did Pakistan celebrate in the similar 
	manner when it defeated India and England in the early 1950s and other 
	leading teams afterwards? Sri Lankans also did not cross the line of decency 
	after winning the World Cup and after so many victories against all the 
	leading teams in the world. Sri Lankan leaders and elites did not nourish 
	(let alone expose) any inferiority complex. One should not miss the 
	not-so-hidden message in the Bangladeshi wild celebrations, which conveys 
	the following: “Look, even we Bengalis can defeat Pakistan and Australia”. 
	This is not similar to what the Japanese did after defeating the mighty 
	Russians in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. Figuratively, Bangladesh today 
	is not another Japan against Russia. Bangladesh’s defeating Pakistan or Sri 
	Lanka, West Indies or India (let alone the tiny Zimbabwe) should not become 
	such occasions of wild celebrations. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The cricket mania, a calculative 
	distraction by politicians mainly to depoliticize urban youth, has been so 
	successful that after the crushing defeat of non-test playing Kenya by 
	test-playing Bangladesh, Bangladeshi dailies publicized the event (actually 
	a non-event) as a “White Wash of Kenya” in the front page. If this reflects 
	some journalists’ immaturity and arrogance, a by-word for inferiority 
	complex, then one does not know what is predicting an innings defeat for 
	Australia, as the media did after Bangladesh had scored 400-odd runs in the 
	first innings only to eventually lose the match to Australia. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ongoing opposition demand for 
	reforming the “caretaker system” is another problematic move to resolve the 
	problematic concept of “caretaker government”, unheard of in the East and 
	the West, to conduct free and fair parliamentary elections in the country. 
	The Awami League-led Fourteen-Party-Alliance (thirteen of them having very 
	negligible to no political clout at all) has been insisting on having a 
	discussion with the ruling coalition to fine tune the “caretaker system”, 
	but is adamant not to put their heads together with any member of the 
	Jamaat-i-Islami, which is a part of the ruling coalition. So, apparently 
	there are two tricky problems to resolve. First, fine tuning the “caretaker 
	system” and then doing it without any participation by the Jamaat. The 
	opposition simply insists on not interacting with any War Criminals and 
	collaborators of 1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The unaware may surmise: “So far so 
	good”. However, those who are familiar with the recent past of Bangladesh 
	during the last twenty-odd years know that top Awami League and 
	Fourteen-Party-Alliance leaders, including Sheikh Hasina and Rashed Khan 
	Menon among others, had absolutely no problem in hobnobbing with some top 
	Jamaat leaders, including Matiur Rahman Nizami. Not only Sheikh Hasina and 
	Nizami were together, holding joint meetings and rallies against the first 
	BNP government of Khaleda Zia during 1991 and 1996, but there are also 
	eye-witness accounts of Rashed Khan Menon’s literally embracing Nizami in 
	public meetings. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One may also point out that on the 
	eve of the Presidential Election of 1991, Justice Badrul Haider Chowdhury, 
	the Awami candidate, went to Ghulam Azam’s residence (the Jamaat patriarch 
	and controversial collaborator of the Pakistani occupation army in 1971) for 
	his “blessings” or political support as the Jamaat had thirty-odd MPs, more 
	than ten per cent of the electorate. What is even more significant that the 
	unheard of concept of an unelected “care taker government” by the political 
	scientists anywhere to run a democracy for three months and hold the most 
	important elections in a parliamentary system was a brainchild of the 
	controversial Ghulam Azam, who became a pariah to the opposition only in the 
	late 1991 for various other reasons. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those familiar with Bangladeshi 
	political culture and socio-political history know the opportunism and lack 
	of commitment to any ideology or leader by the bulk of the Bengali (mainly 
	Muslim) politicians. Consequently one has no reason to be surprised by their 
	vacillation. However, what is very unfortunate for the nation is that 
	“politics” (in the pejorative sense) has over-powered economics and common 
	sense, decency, justice and truth. One wonders if Bengalis could 
	successfully elect the right type of representatives in 1937, 1946, 1954, 
	and most importantly, in the 1970’s Parliamentary Elections in united 
	Pakistan without having this bizarre, peculiar and outlandish “caretaker 
	system”, why on earth they need it now. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we have experienced in the wake 
	of the three parliamentary elections since 1991 held under “caretaker 
	governments”, the outcome of the elections has never been acceptable to 
	those who have to sit in the opposition bench. So, what is the big fuss 
	about the system, which is neither foolproof nor anything to be proud of as 
	a democracy? Having this absurd concept of “caretaker” simply implies that 
	the Bangladeshi polity and the voters are in regression, in a state of 
	immaturity and that no body is trust worthy any more to hold free and fair 
	elections in the country. One is not sure if after the next parliamentary 
	elections in 2007, as an alternative to the “caretaker system”, the leader 
	of the opposition (whoever she or he will be around) would be asking the UN 
	for International Peacekeeping Force to hold “free and fair” elections in 
	the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is really unfortunate that while 
	the rich is getting richer and poor poorer at an alarming rate for the last 
	thirty-odd years, despite all the poverty alleviation programmes through the 
	NGOs and public sector, the bulk of the politicians and members of the civil 
	society, intellectuals, students, bureaucrats and businessmen have been 
	engaged in an unhealthy rat race – some to survive and some to 
	get-rich-quick. Consequently the real problems –such as population growth, 
	lack of health care and education, hunger and poverty, hyper inflation 
	(about 10,000 per cent price hike since 1970), rampant corruption by 
	politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats – have receded to the background, 
	as designed by political, business and professional elites. The upshot is 
	the preponderance of non issues and red herrings to distract the masses from 
	the real issues. Hence the celebration of “Kansat Victory” in the wake of 
	the massacre, lunatic exuberance over cricket and the phony war and 
	controversy over the outlandish “caretaker system”. </font></p>
