  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="4">Introduction:</font><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The Shariah or Muslim code with all its variations and
  contradictions has created problems both for Muslims and non-Muslims in
  Muslim-dominated as well as other countries in our times. The term
  “Shariah” evokes bad memories among its victims as well as opponents who
  want the abolition or drastic reforms of this Draconian code. Our experience
  tells us that Shariah is inherently prejudicial to women, non-Muslims and
  freethinkers and that its language, spirit and above all, execution, go
  against the spirit, ideals and teaching of Islam as one finds in the Quran.
  However, ironically the mullahs or the various categories of Muslim clerics
  who are supposed to be the upholders of the ideals of Islam, the religion of
  peace and tolerance, have been the main promoters and defenders of Shariah
  which stands in contravention of human rights, decency and civilized
  behhaviour. Another hindrance towards the process of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>reformation of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Shariah
  (if not its total abrogation) is the immoderate views of many practicing and
  non-practicing Muslims who simply endorse the views of the backward-looking
  mullah who mostly cite the Hadises ( “Sayings” of the Prophet) and books
  of <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Fiqh (Muslim jurisprudence) to
  justify the oppressive Shariah.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The collective ignorance of the Muslim community combined
  with the vested interests of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>some
  members of the community is sustaining this incongruous Shariah code. The
  Muslim community in general and that of Bangladesh in particular can replace
  this absurd, outdated un-Islamic code of Shariah with a liberal and modern one
  only through collective efforts of the members of the civil society, human
  rights groups, intellectuals <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>and
  politicians belonging to both the Islamic and secular groups. They need to
  educate both the mullahs and ordinary Muslims with regard to the obscurantist
  aspects of the Shariah. The core of the problem is political. So, only social
  reformist agenda by a few cultural groups will not be able to bell the cat.
  Most importantly, slanderous, Islam bashing writing and activists like Taslima
  Nasrin and others with a built-in prejudice against Islam combined with their
  abysmal ignorance about religion, history and culture of the people concerned
  are as counter-productive as the close-minded mullahs in this regard.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="4">Brief
  History and Background:</font><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">We need to understand the importance of Islam both in the
  private and public domains of the Muslims in <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  . Unfortunately, many secular/Islam bashing Bangladeshi intellectuals think
  that Islam is just a peripheral, alien concept, subject to subsumption under
  Bengali Nationalism or what they think is “secularism”.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Although apparently <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  came into being in the name of Bengali nationalism and secularism, the country
  has retained its Muslim/Islamic character for the obvious reasons. Firstly, it
  is the third largest Muslim country after <st1:country-region>
  Indonesia</st1:country-region>
  and <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Pakistan</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  . Secondly, those who believe and promote the primordiality of the
  Muslim/Islamic identity for the country also argue that a) the emergence of
  Bangladesh did not signal the death of the “two-nation-theory” as the
  Muslim majority East Pakistan, for various reasons, emerged with a new name as
  an independent country; and that b) “secularism” was never a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">raison d’etre</i> for the Liberation Struggle of 1971.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Not only “pro-Pakistani elements” but many leading
  pro-Bangladeshis also hold similar views. It is noteworthy that while the late
  Abul Mansur Ahmed, a leading pro-Bangladeshi figure, portrayed the emergence
  of Bangladesh as the late realization of the “Lahore Resolution” (of 1940
  for separate Muslim states in the Subcontinent), Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in his
  first public speech in independent Bangladesh in 1972 proudly asserted that
  Bangladesh was the second largest “Muslim country” in the world.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In view of the above, it is hardly surprising that <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  has retained its Muslim/Islamic character and of late has re-asserted its
  Muslim/Islamic identity by incorporating Islam as the “state religion”
  through an amendment of the Constitution. This politically motivated,
  opportunistic legislation of 1988 by military dictator General Ershad has
  remained intact under the post-military oligarchs of the country. The
  pervasive influence of Islam culturally, socially and politically has remained
  intact and has been rather gaining ground in <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  in the recent years. One may explain the Islamic resurgence in <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  in terms of “a global phenomenon”, nothing so unique about the country. I
  have elsewhere attributed it to the “failure of the welfare state”- as in <st1:country-region>
  Algeria</st1:country-region>
  , <st1:country-region>
  Egypt</st1:country-region>
  , the <st1:country-region>
  Sudan</st1:country-region>
  , <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Afghanistan</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  and elsewhere in the Muslim World, Islamic resurgence in the post-Cold War
  also reflects the growing frustration of the Muslim lower middle classes and
  urban poor at the failure of the promised welfare state under “socialism”.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This essay is, however, an attempt to go beyond economics
  and politics to explain the prevalent influence of the Shariah and mullahs on
  the bulk of the Bengali Muslims. This again is not an appraisal of Islamic
  resurgence and militancy in <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  but an attempt to understand what goes on in the name of Islam with special
  reference to the codes of conduct and day-to-day behaviour of the average
  Muslim beyond the realm of politics. This is, in short, an attempt to explain
  the influence of Islam on the Bangladeshi Muslim psyche in terms of the
  psychohistory of the people.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Contrary to the popular belief, the mass conversion
  process of Bengalis into Muslims in the medieval period was neither initiated
  by the Muslim rulers nor had the people who got converted primarily been the
  low caste Hindus. The bulk of the converts came from the persecuted and
  marginalized non-Hindus, some Buddhist and mostly tribal.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">As Richard Eaton has shown in his seminal work, <i>The
  Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760, </i>Muslim saints and Sufis
  were instrumental in Islamizing the deltaic southeastern Bengal, especially
  during the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries, by providing
  leadership in clearing forests and reclaiming lands in the wake of the series
  of catastrophic turbulence caused by the shifting of riverbeds. The Sufis, so
  goes the theory, not only helped the indigenous tribesmen fight wild animals,
  especially tigers, but also taught them the use of plough and bullocks and
  simultaneously introduced Islam highlighting the concept of an almighty God or
  Allah, said to be much more powerful than the hitherto worshipped gods and
  goddesses.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The process of reclaiming forests and driving away wild
  animals in the newly reclaimed southeastern Bengal under the Turco-Persian
  Sufi leadership under the Mughal patronage exposed Bengali Muslims and the new
  converts to the “great traditions” [to paraphrase Robert Redfield] of
  Islam as well as Sufism. However, the history of mass conversion of Bengalis
  is also replete with stories of supernatural power and “miracles” of the
  Sufis. Consequently one may argue that Islamizaion of lower <st1:place>
  Bengal</st1:place>
  was more due to the “miracles” and the sincere support that Sufis lent to
  the helpless Bengali cultivators against natural calamities and extortionist
  Hindu rulers and landlords than due to the spiritual superiority of Islam.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Even if we agree with Asim Roy ( <i>The Islamic
  Syncretistic Tradition in Bengal </i>) that the bulk of the Bangladeshi
  Muslims had been syncretistic up to the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century before the
  puritanical<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Islamic reformism of
  Karamat Ali Jaunpuri and the Faraizis under<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Haji Shariatullah and Dudu Miyan gained any foothold in the region, we
  cannot deny the preponderance of the Shariah-oriented “great traditions”
  of Islam, at least among the upper class Muslims. Both the evangelical and
  “warrior Sufis” (Shah Jalal, Khan Jahan and many others) and Mughal civil
  and military officials promoted the Shariah-based “great traditions” of
  Islam in the region. The British also retained the Shariah as the basis of
  Muslim personal/family law to avoid further complications and confrontation
  with the orthodox Muslims.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">However, the so-called “great traditions” or the
  Shariah-oriented Islam in South Asia, including Bengal, actually incorporated <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>thousands
  of pre-Islamic “little traditions” of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>the Middle East and <st1:place>
  Central Asia</st1:place>
  . These post-Prophet accretions, superstitions and both the non- and
  un-Islamic rituals, customs and laws are collectively known as the Shariah
  law. Under the influence of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ulama</i>
  (theologians), Muslims globally believe that<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Shariah is in accordance with the teachings of the Quran and the Holy
  Prophet. Now, to understand the nature of Shariah and the surrounding myth
  about its divinity and inseparability from the Quran or scripture (“great
  traditions”) we need to know its origin and growth during the last 1,000-odd
  years, including its overpowering and malevolent effects, especially on women,
  minorities and Muslim free-thinkers.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="4">What
  is Shariah?</font><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The term Shariah literally means the track created by
  camels to and from the water holes, ponds or river, implying that it is more
  of a tradition rather than<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>new set
  of laws, to be followed blindly by the Muslims. The proponents of Shariah
  assert that there is no scope of further investigation or re-interpretation of
  the Quranic texts and the Hadis literature. In short, Shariah is the
  combination of legal opinions of Muslim jurists (Muftis and Faqihs) sought and
  enforced by medieval Muslim rulers. Thus the main<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>sources of Shariah are: The Quran; Hadises<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>or the so-called and actual sayings of the Prophet; Fiqh<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>or Muslim jurisprudence based on the individual and/or collective
  opinions of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>jurists (Qiyas and
  Ijma, respectively); local customs and traditions and common sense.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Since there are only<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>around eighty-odd Quranic verses which are regulative or prescriptive,
  the thousands of Shariah regulations are obviously based on thousands of
  spurious Hadises and legal opinions of the pre-modern Sunni and Shia jurists
  during the 8<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> centuries. Since we know about
  the poor quality of most Hadises with regard to their authenticity and the low
  level of intellectual capacity of the medieval<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Hadis collectors, including Imams Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmizi and Abu
  Dawood and Muslim scholars and jurists like<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Abu Hanifa, Hanbal, Shafi, Malik<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and
  (even the great philosopher,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Imam
  Ghazzali), we have every reason to shudder at the very idea of accepting the
  infallibility of the so-called Hadis and Fiqh-based Shariah considering it as
  sacred as the Holy Quran.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">A brief history of Shariah requires a re-appraisal of the
  history of Hadis collection. Although the collection process started during
  the life time of the Prophet and immediately after his death, a systematic
  albeit unscientific collection process started around two hundred years after
  the death of the Prophet. From its absurdity to abysmal vulgarity,
  unscientific crudeness, the Hadis literature is full of contradictions, lies
  and concoctions to justify anything that suits the caprice of <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>unrefined
  kings and nobles,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>debauch husbands
  and womanizers, polygamists, rapists and child abusers, dictators, ruthless
  murderers and slave owners. The collection process and<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>the contents of the so-called Sahih (authentic) Bukhari Hadises,
  supposed to be the most authentic in the entire corpus of Hadis literature,
  are good enough in establishing their absurdity. Imam Bukhari is said to have
  collected more than 600,000 and retained around 7,000 <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Hadises
  considering them<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sahih or
  authentic/acceptable. One may forgive Imam Bukhari’s lapses and limitations
  but there is no justification in accepting all of these “Sahih Hadises” as
  the sayings of the Prophet ignoring their vulgarity, contradictions and anti-Quranic<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>expositions.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The Hadis literature is full of vulgar, pornographic and
  totally unnecessary narrations about <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>the
  Holy Prophet’s methods of cleaning himself after copulation, his sexual
  prowess, said to be “equivalent to the virility of forty young and healthy
  men”. We also find in these “Sahih Hadises of Bukhari Shareef ”and in
  the collections by Muslim, Tirmizi and others how Eve (Hawwa) was created from
  a rib of Adam; why wives should prostrate before their husbands; how dogs,
  donkeys, horses and women belong to the same category and hundreds of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>other narratives which contradict the Quran, history, science, nature
  and common sense. They are also unjust and humiliating for women, non-Arabs
  and non-Muslims. It is interesting that while the “Rib Story” about the
  creation of Eve is a pre-Islamic, Biblical myth<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>and is not mentioned in the Quran, other pejorative expressions about
  women and non-Muslims, quite common in the Hadis literature and Shariah, also
  do not exist in the Quran. While polygamy is very restrictive and conditional
  in the Quran (only the war widows and orphan girls in the wake of the Battle
  of Wuhud were allowed to be married, “two, three or four” at a time by
  Muslim men), the Hadises and the Shariah law have not only justified polygamy
  but also the pre-Islamic institutions of harem, concubinage, temporary
  marriage or Mutah (according to the Shiite Shariah), veiling of women,
  castrating of slaves and among other vices, the subjugation of women in every
  sphere of life.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">Fiqh or Muslim jurisprudence as it exists today as the
  text of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Shariah law developed
  during the Umayyad (660-750) and Abbasid dynasties (750-1258), especially
  during the 8<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> centuries, The early Abbasid
  rulers ruthlessly persecuted<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>many
  leading Muslim jurists on charges of heresy, although most jurists justified
  absolute monarchy and other vices associated with it in the name of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Shariah. The subservient jurists virtually created two sets of Shariah
  law and principles, one for the ruling classes and another for the masses.
  Under the aegis of these opportunist jurists, women, slaves and non-Muslims
  suffered most. Due to the double standards of Muslim rulers and their
  subservient ulama/jurists it appears that what the Quran has given to women
  and non-Muslims has conveniently taken away by the Shariah. The evil of
  Shariah became most apparent during the ruthlessly autocratic Ottoman Turkish
  rule (1280-1922). The Sultans and the self-styled Ottoman or Osmanli caliphs
  or Khalifas ( Sultan Selim I conquered <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Egypt</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  and overthrew<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Mamluk sultan
  and the puppet Abbasid Caliph in 1517 and adopted the title of caliph)
  formally introduced the Shariah as the official code in the empire. Later
  Indian Muslim sultans also introduced Shariah for their Muslim subjects.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The grip of Shariah became overpowering during the reign
  of the most immoderate and ultra-orthodox (and cruel) Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.
  He not only implemented Shariah to the detriment of women, non-Muslims and
  Muslim free-thinkers but he also gave royal patronage and generous funding for
  the codification of Shariah law. This resulted in the publication of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">magnum
  opus</i> of Shariah<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in the
  Subcontinent, the famous or infamous<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
  Fatawah-i-Alamgiri</i>. This collection of Shariah laws dating from the early
  Abbasid period is the standard source of Muslim law for the Sunni Muslims of
  the Subcontinent, including <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  .</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Further elaboration of the evil of Shariah and its
  anti-Islamic spirit and role reveals that it virtually stands against the<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Quran by placing a parallel theology, ethics and law in total
  contravention of Islam. We may cite a few examples to prove our assertion:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">1) While the Quran prescribes 80 lashes as punishment for
  adultery, the Shariah sanctions<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">stoning to death <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>for
  both the adulterer and adulteress ( Stoning to death is a Jewish custom, once
  applied by the Prophet as a mode of punishment for a Jewish man and woman in
  accordance with their law in the nascent Jewish-Muslim state of Medina.);</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">2) While there is no death penalty for apostasy in the
  Quran for renouncing Islam,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the
  Shariah is very strict about enforcing the death penalty for the apostate or
  Murtad (the proponents of this harsh view might have been misled by the first
  Caliph Abu Bakr’s declaring holy war against the apostates of Arabia who
  revolted and challenged the Medina-based nascent state of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>the early Muslims after the death of the Prophet);</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">3) While the Quran stipulates equal status for men and
  women, Muslims and non-Muslims in the eyes of Allah, the Shariah under the
  influence of spurious Hadises<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>deviates
  from the Quranic injunctions in this regard.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">One may cite hundreds of such violations of the spirit
  and prescribed Quranic code through Shariah. A reappraisal of the mullah (his
  psyche, background and limitations) and the mullah-elite and mullah-mass
  nexuses is required for a proper comprehension of the problem.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="4">Mullah
  and His Mindset:</font><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Mullah is a generic term denoting all the Muslim clerics,
  Imams (prayer leaders), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">madrassah</i>
  (Muslim seminary) teachers, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">pirs</i>
  (Sufi mentors) and other members of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ulama</i>
  (Islamic scholars). As a class they represent politically subservient,
  economically dependent (and not-so-wealthy and even poor) and socially
  subservient but influential groups of people. Their subservience and
  dependence on the polity, especially since the disappearance of Muslim
  dynasties in most Muslim countries during the colonial and post-colonial
  periods (18<sup>th</sup>-20<sup>th</sup> centuries), have turned them into
  angry bigots vying for the restoration of their lost glory, power and
  influence under Muslim empires and kingdoms. The mullah is perpetually unhappy
  with modernism as he rightly apprehends it will eventually hammer the last
  nail into the coffin of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">mullahcracy.</i> Although “pragmatic” mullahs collaborated with
  pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial cruel and corrupt autocracies,
  justifying rulers like Yazid, Sultan Mahmud, Timur Lang, Aurangzeb, British
  colonial masters, Yahya Khan, General Zia ul Haq, <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Saddam
  Hussein, <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>General Ershad, General
  Suharto and many others as “Islamic”, but simultaneously asserted their
  rights to interpret the Shariah, for the obvious reason. By legitimizing
  autocracy they legitimize their privileged position in the polity. The mullahs
  are the first ones to raise the “Islam-in-danger” slogan as they have
  successfully drawn the synonymity between Islam and themselves. In short, they
  do not mind legitimizing autocracy, slavery, harem, polygamy, concubinage and
  even genocide and terrorism provided there is give-and-take between themselves
  and their patrons. Their opposition to NGOs and other agents of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>empowerment and employment for Bangladeshi women in the recent years is
  reflective of their apprehension of losing leverage, influence and employments
  (as quacks and “healers”) to the “agents of globalization and
  modernization”, especially in the country side.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Although the socially conservative mullahs could be
  politically radical, as it happened during the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup>
  centuries in <st1:place>
  British India</st1:place>
  , they nevertheless remain backward looking and reactionary, as we know, the
  vast majority of Bengali mullahs collaborated with the Pakistani military
  during the Liberation War of Bangladesh. Their lack of liberal education and
  employability in lucrative jobs are also responsible for their apprehensive,
  vacillating and opportunistic nature. What they learn in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">madrassah,</i>
  both in the old and the “modern” ones, is simply unbelievable. The
  primitive <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">madrassah</i> system follows
  the thousand-odd-year old curricula devoid of any modern sciences (natural or
  social). Geography, history, sociology, economics, anthropology or psychology
  is simply beyond their comprehension. They even have no idea about other
  religions. The only thing they know/believe that all the roots of knowledge
  are there in the Holy Quran and that the followers of all the other religions
  will go to hell (contrary to what the Quran tells us in the Surah Baqara,
  Chapter 2).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Most <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">madrassah </i>graduates,
  including the Shaykhul Hadises or Muhaddises (Hadis scholars) and Fiqh
  scholars<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>in <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  cannot even converse in standard Bengali. They only know some pidgin <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Bengali,
  Urdu and Arabic. The highest educated <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">madrassah</i>
  graduate has very sketchy to no idea about the history of <st1:place>
  <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  </st1:place>
  (let alone world history), politics and economics.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Their lack of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>exposure
  to liberal education - the study of modern history, philosophy, logic and
  literature- has turned them into extremely intolerant and angry people. Their
  anger, immoderate views and megalomaniac attitude also reflect their inherent
  inferiority complex vis-à-vis the modern/Western educated people, members of
  the rich and powerful elite classes. Hence the emphasis on Shariah-oriented
  education and government so that the mullah remain politically important and
  socially influential.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It would be<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>too
  trite a postulate to assume that only the Bangladeshi mullahs, including the
  “highly educated” ones, are the only remnants of rusticity and
  obscurantism, but their counterparts in Pakistan, India, Egypt, Afghanistan
  and elsewhere are also equally, if not more, ignorant , intolerant and
  arrogant. While Maulana Delwar Hussein Saidi, one of the most well-known
  mullahs of <st1:country-region>
  Bangladesh</st1:country-region>
  , compares women with fruits and animals in his public speeches, the late
  Sheikh<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jadd al-Haq of the <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Al-Azhar</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  University</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  in one of his public statements in 1999 (quoted by the BBC) justified female
  genital mutilation or “female circumcision” as Islamic and<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>antidotal to HIV (AIDS) infection. We know he was wrong on both counts.
  The cruel genital mutilation is a pre-Islamic Ethiopian and central African <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>custom
  (practiced by Muslims, Christians, Jews and animists in <st1:country-region>
  Ethiopia</st1:country-region>
  and elsewhere in Africa, west Asia and <st1:place>
  Southeast Asia</st1:place>
  ) and has nothing to do with Islam. And we know that this cruel practice
  cannot save women from AIDS.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font size="4">What
  should be done:</font><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Without giving more details about the rusticity of the
  mullah, we may suggest the remedy as to how to contain the mullah, curtail the
  influence of the overpowering Shariah and motivate the civil society,
  political parties, civil and military bureaucracy, students and intellectuals,
  peasants and working classes, including women, to do something positive in
  this regard.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The educated, rich and powerful sections of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>society must call the shots. They must put their foot down and assert
  firmly that neither the Shariah nor its main proponents, the mullahs, have any
  <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">locus standi</i> to interfere in the
  running of the state and in the religious affairs of the Muslims. They must
  also assert that as the Shariah contradicts the Quran and so does the Hadis
  literature to a great extent, so they are dispensable. We must assert that to
  remain a good faithful Muslim, one does not have to believe in Hadis
  literature and Shariah. One has to believe in six things to remain Muslim and
  the Hadis is not one of them. Modern Muslim scholars, mainly social
  scientists— historians, philosophers, anthropologists and sociologists—
  and a few enlightened mullahs with sufficient knowledge about comparative
  religion, astronomy (to resolve the problem of moon sighting for the next 500
  years for example, for the smooth celebration of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Eids and Ramadan), geography, physics, Islamic and world history and
  literature will have to establish the superiority of the intellect over
  presumptuous knowledge and pretentious books of the Hadises and the obsolete
  Fiqh.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">For the sake of uniformity and justice for the women and
  other weaker sections of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>society,
  the bulk of the Hadis literature should be banned for its anti-Islamic and
  blasphemous contents denigrating the Holy Prophet and the Quran. Muslim
  intellectuals and members of the civil society in alliance with all the
  secular/liberal political parties and the enlightened sections of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ulama
  </i>should come forward with the argument that since there is no priesthood in
  Islam, no Shaykhul Hadis or Maulana, let alone the half-educated mullahs,
  should be allowed to arrogate the sole authority of interpreting the Quran and
  the authentic sayings of the Prophet. Any<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>practicing Muslim social scientist should be considered a member of the
  <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">ulama</i>, entitled to interpret the Quranic texts in accordance with
  the need of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, not the 8<sup>th</sup> or 11<sup>th</sup>
  centuries.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The civil society, political parties and the government
  should come forward in support of egalitarian and just family law to give
  equal shares of property to the female family members and prohibit polygamy
  once for all. Bangladeshi Muslims across the board should support the
  government move to allow women to seek divorce when they find it impossible to
  live with their husbands any longer, in accordance with the Quran.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Unless the unholy nexus between greedy Muslim men and the
  self-styled custodians of Islam (the mullah) who resort to the Shariah to
  deprive the Muslim women from their rights, forcing them to wear the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">hijab</i>,
  turning them out of the mosque and accepting the husband’s right to marry
  two, three or four women at a time, there is no way out of the iron grip of
  the Shariah and its obscurantist supporters among the mullah and other
  ignorant Muslims. We must stop the ignorant mullah from giving speeches
  violating any injunction of the Quran or justifying something as Islamic by
  citing conveniently some Hadis or Fiqh as their source. They must not be given
  a free rein on Eid and Friday congregations and should be strictly monitored
  by the law enforcing agencies so that they do not publish or narrate things
  over TV, Radio or in any public forum contrary to the teachings of the Quran
  and against minorities and liberal/freethinking Muslims. Measures should be
  taken to proscribe selective Hadises for their vulgarity, unscientific
  expositions and for contradicting the Quran. Rustic “Islamic” books like
  the notoriously vulgar and unscientific <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Moksodul Momeneen, Neamul Quran</i> and<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> </i>scores of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>other
  publications, full of un-Islamic materials, along with the video and audio
  tapes of Maulana Delwar Hussein Saidi should be banned for the sake of Islam
  and decency. Most of these books written by various mullahs are pornographic
  and blasphemous to Islam. They represent the popular Islam or the “little
  traditions” heavily influenced by Tantric Hinduism, Baul cult and other
  local non-Islamic beliefs and traditions.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Finally, educated Bangladeshi Muslims should stop the
  mullahs whenever they start narrating fairy tales and absurd stories in the
  name of Islam and its Prophet in public forums and mosques. If<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>the educated and powerful members of society continue to protect the
  mullahs out of compassion and respect for their “piety and knowledge”,
  then there is no way out of the quagmire of Shariah and the evil influence of
  the rustic, syncretistic mullahs who promote pre- and un-Islamic alien cults
  and belief systems in the name of Islam. In fact the mullahs (with a very few
  exceptions) are polluting the society as well as Islam. Since the mullahs can
  be very vicious, as we experienced in 1971 during the Liberation War, we
  should be also very firm and united in our resistance to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mullahcracy.</i>
  The mullahs only understand the language of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>coercion. They flourish most under rulers like Aurangzeb, Zia ul-Haq
  and Ershad and are contained as mere subservient clerics under bold and
  decisive <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>rulers like Akber,
  Jahangir, Jinnah, Sukarno and Mahathir Muhammad. The moment a ruling class or
  a party in power tries to coax the mullah to contain its political adversaries
  or to legitimize its rule, the mullah sits on its head and “Islamize” the
  polity to the detriment of secularism, liberal democracy and human rights. We
  must make people understand that neither the mullah nor his Hadis and Fiqh are
  necessary for us to remain good Muslims. As there is nothing divine about the
  Shariah so is there no truth in the mullah’s assertion that they are the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">naib-i-rasool</i>
  or lieutenants of the Prophet of Islam. A Muslim does not need any
  intermediaries to reach God and His Prophet.<o:p>
