	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was January 1977, in the city of 
	Bhubaneswar, capital of Orissa. The gathering was one of the most elitist in 
	India, the Indian Science Congress. Those were the waning years of Mrs. 
	Gandhi’s Emergency Regime. Life was getting grudgingly normal. Mrs. Gandhi’s 
	elite Gestapo, RAW, having reported opposition to her rule totally 
	subjugated, she had relaxed. Many of the detainees had been released, except 
	the hard core. Other than the Naxal all the political forces were spent or 
	appeared spent. The anger of the Indian people, unable to find leadership to 
	express itself, was simmering underground like a volcano. On the surface 
	everything looked quite calm, though not relaxed. Maybe like the last days 
	of Pompeii. The eruption was soon to bury Mrs. Gandhi and her lackeys for 
	the next 2 years, till some stupid and opportunistic action by Charan Singh 
	et al brought her back in power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That evening I went to attend the 
	seminar on Rural Development, presided over by one of India’s most famous 
	scientists, Dr. Swaminathan. When I reached there, a little late, I found 
	the seminar having started, and one very impressive lady speaking fervently 
	holding forth on the problems of rural women of India. As I settled down and 
	started listening to her impassioned speech I realized she was totally 
	unaware of the rural realities, at least of Orissa. As I heard her more 
	attentively I was convinced that the speaker, though a very learned person, 
	did not really know her subject at all. She was haranguing about the 
	unavailability of cooking gas, protected potable water, and basic needs of 
	modern life for the 80% of Indians who lived in villages! If I had known who 
	she was I would not have dared to go to the stage. But young and untamed at 
	that time, I felt my hackles rising at the person who delivered such a 
	passionate speech to a gathering of such eminent policy-makers of the 
	country. I felt I must tell the people that this elite sampling of India and 
	its thinking were a trap. Creating an India of their dreams which did not 
	exist, busy solving the problems which were imaginary. How could a person 
	solve rural problems without knowing them? This was 10 years after the 
	publication of the epochal research by Prof. Rath and Dandekar - “ Poverty 
	in Rural India”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, with permission from Dr. 
	Swaminathan, I gathered all my courage and went to the dais. This was the 
	same place where 10,000 people were seated in the morning and Mrs. Gandhi 
	had addressed them. My points were very simple. I minced no words, and they 
	came from direct experience. I told the august audience that the previous 
	expert was no expert at all. What rural women need in India was not any of 
	the items that she spoke about. What they needed was potable water at an 
	accessible distance. In other words, tube wells or even wells in the 
	villages. Particularly, the Harijan quarters of the communities. Many of 
	them walk 3 to 4 miles every morning to get potable water. This detracts 
	from their economic activities, and keeps them perpetually poor. The biggest 
	bang for the buck would be to provide accessible water to the rural folks. 
	It will render the quality of their life much better. There was an eerie 
	silence as I left the dais, and a man passed me on his way to the dais. He 
	said he was a professor of Physics in the Bombay University, that he was 
	from the biggest district in India, the Chanda District of Maharastra State. 
	And, then to my surprise, he said , he fully and heartily supports me! 
	Unfortunately, I have forgotten his name at this distance in time. But any 
	one from Bombay would probably know him. He said he himself was a Harijan 
	from the biggest district in India, and the most backward district in 
	Maharastra, Chanda. He introduced himself as a Physics professor from Bombay 
	University. Then he commended me for speaking out about the real situation. 
	He emphatically repeated that what I had said was very true. I don’t know 
	what triggered his emotions, but he slowly and surely recounted his own 
	story. He said he had been a brilliant student, and in spite of his humble 
	beginnings, his father taught him early that his ticket to success was to 
	take advantage of free or almost free education in India. And he did. Then 
	it happened. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He had topped the Bombay 
	University’s Physics M.Sc. examination. Extremely happy, he started from 
	Bombay for his village where the news would take inordinately long to reach 
	his family. His father did not buy a news paper. When he reached the railway 
	station near his village, he got down and started walking, delighted and 
	excited to give this great news to his family and relatives. He was 
	imagining how it will light up their faces and will create a real festive 
	occasion in those impoverished hamlets. In the excitement he forgot to take 
	off his shoes when he passed by the houses of upper caste Hindus of his 
	village. He knew the village custom that he was not to pass by the upper 
	caste colony wearing any footwear. But then, he had lived in Bombay for the 
	last 6 years and was too excited to remember this . As he reached home, his 
	family was filled with joy. The whole Dalit community, on learning of it, 
	came to his house and congratulated him, every one hugging and blessing him, 
	and bringing whatever food they had for a community dinner in his honor.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">About two hours later a crowd 
	started moving in the direction of the Dalit colony. Soon it reached his 
	house and someone called his father by name. When his father came out the 
	crowd of about 100 people told him that they knew that his son has came 
	first in the University, but that was in the Bombay City not in their 
	village. That he had grown so audacious as to walk in front of their houses 
	with shoes on? This impertinence would not be tolerated, else when he got a 
	job he would drive his car in front of their houses. No way they could allow 
	this behavior by a lowly Harijan. If he wanted his family to live in the 
	village he had to make a penance spelled out by us. He must come back to the 
	street where he walked with his shoes on and stand there with his shoes on 
	his head in the midday sun that day. However, he has an option. His father 
	can substitute for him if he demurs. If they didn’t comply, their house 
	would be burnt and they would have to leave he village for ever that very 
	night. The Physics professor told the audience that he had no choice because 
	they had done exactly this to other families in their colony, earlier. He 
	went through the painful ordeal and then the same night he left the village 
	with his family for good. He could not have done otherwise because the only 
	water source in the village was in the control of the upper castes. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I remember the whole audience was 
	moved by this story but I believe nobody felt outraged enough to do anything 
	to undo the wrong. In fact the lady speaker, some years later, became the 
	Chairman of the UGC ( University Grant Commission, India, the agency that 
	oversees the Universities of India, and doles out research grants). Reward 
	for her good work as a scholar and policy-maker. Today, they have a name: 
	Ranvir Sena, in Bihar. In most parts of India they don’t have a name, but 
	they exist, exploit and torment the poor Dalits, as in the above case. They 
	have existed for ages, in comfort and assurance, as part of the “tolerant” 
	Hindu society from the days of Shankaracharya when Buddhism was banished 
	from India and Brahminism restored to its original glory. Or ignominy?
