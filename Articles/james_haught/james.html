	<br>
	Religion is an extremely touchy topic. Church members often become angry if 
	anyone questions their supernatural dogmas. (Bertrand Russell said this is 
	because they subconsciously sense that their beliefs are irrational.) So I 
	try to avoid confrontations that can hurt feelings. Nearly everyone wants to 
	be courteous. But sometimes disputes can't be avoided. If you think the 
	spirit realm is imaginary, and if honesty makes you say so, you may find 
	yourself under attack. It has happened to many doubters. Thomas Jefferson 
	was called a &quot;howling atheist.&quot; Leo Tolstoy was called an &quot;impious infidel.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Well, if you wind up in a debate, my advice is: Try to be polite. Don't let 
	tempers flare, if you can help it. Appeal to your accuser's intelligence.<br>
	<br>
	I've hatched some questions you may find useful. They're designed to show 
	that church members, even the most ardent worshipers, are skeptics 
	too--because they doubt every magical system except their own.<br>
	<br>
	If a churchman berates you, you might reply like this: </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You're an unbeliever, just like me. 
	You doubt many sacred dogmas. Let me show you: </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Millions of Hindus pray over statues 
	of Shiva's penis. Do you think there's an invisible Shiva who wants his 
	penis prayed over--or are you a skeptic? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mormons say that Jesus came to 
	America after his resurrection. Do you agree--or are you a doubter?<br>
	<br>
	Florida's Santeria worshipers sacrifice dogs, goats, chickens, etc., and 
	toss their bodies into waterways. Do you think Santeria gods want animals 
	killed--or are you skeptical?<br>
	<br>
	Muslim suicide bombers who blow themselves up in Israel are taught that 
	&quot;martyrs&quot; go instantly to a paradise full of lovely female houri nymphs. Do 
	you think the dead bombers are in heaven with houris--or are you a doubter?<br>
	<br>
	Unification Church members think Jesus visited Master Moon and told him to 
	convert all people as &quot;Moonies.&quot; Do you believe this sacred tenet of the 
	Unification Church?<br>
	<br>
	Jehovah's Witnesses say that, any day now, Satan will come out of the earth 
	with an army of demons, and Jesus will come out of the sky with an army of 
	angels, and the Battle of Armageddon will kill everyone on earth except 
	Jehovah's Witnesses. Do you believe this solemn teaching of their church?<br>
	<br>
	Aztecs skinned maidens and cut out human hearts for a feathered serpent god. 
	What's your stand on invisible feathered serpents? Aha!--just as I 
	suspected, you don't believe.<br>
	<br>
	Catholics are taught that the communion wafer and wine magically become the 
	actual body and blood of Jesus during chants and bell-ringing. Do you 
	believe in the &quot;real presence&quot;--or are you a disbeliever?<br>
	<br>
	Faith-healer Ernest Angley says he has the power, described in the Bible, to 
	&quot;discern spirits,&quot; which enables him to see demons inside sick people, and 
	see angels hovering at his revivals. Do you believe this religious 
	assertion?<br>
	<br>
	The Bible says people who work on the sabbath must be killed: &quot;Whosoever 
	doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death&quot; (Exodus 
	31:15). Should we execute Sunday workers--or do you doubt this scripture?<br>
	<br>
	At a golden temple in West Virginia, saffron-robed worshipers think they'll 
	become one with Lord Krishna if they chant &quot;Hare Krishna&quot; enough. Do you 
	agree--or do you doubt it?<br>
	<br>
	Members of the Heaven's Gate commune said they could &quot;shed their containers&quot; 
	(their bodies) and be transported to a UFO behind the Hale-Bopp Comet. Do 
	you think they're now on that UFO--or are you a skeptic?<br>
	<br>
	During the witch hunts, inquisitor priests tortured thousands of women into 
	confessing that they blighted crops, had sex with Satan, etc. then burned 
	them for it. Do you think the church was right to enforce the Bible's 
	command, &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&quot; (Exodus 22:18)--or do you 
	doubt this scripture?<br>
	<br>
	Members of Spiritualist churches say they talk with the dead during worship 
	services. Do you think they actually communicate with spirits of deceased 
	people?<br>
	<br>
	Millions of American Pentecostals spout &quot;the unknown tongue,&quot; a spontaneous 
	outpouring of sounds. They say it is the Holy Ghost, the third god of the 
	Trinity, speaking through them. Do you believe this sacred tenet of many 
	Americans?<br>
	<br>
	Scientologists say each human has a soul which is a &quot;Thetan&quot; that came from 
	another planet. Do you believe their doctrine--or doubt it?<br>
	<br>
	Ancient Greeks thought a multitude of gods lived on Mt. Olympus--and some of 
	today's New Agers think invisible Lemurians live inside Mt. Shasta. What's 
	your position on mountain gods--belief or disbelief?<br>
	<br>
	In the mountains of West Virginia, some people obey Christ's farewell 
	command that true believers &quot;shall take up serpents&quot; (Mark 16:18).They pick 
	up rattlers at church services. Do you believe this scripture, or not?<br>
	<br>
	India's Thugs thought the many-armed goddess Kali wanted them to strangle 
	human sacrifices. Do you think there's an invisible goddess who wants people 
	strangled--or are you a disbeliever?<br>
	<br>
	Tibet's Buddhists say that when an old Lama dies, his spirit enters a baby 
	boy being born somewhere. So they remain leaderless for a dozen years or 
	more, then they find a pubescent boy who seems to have knowledge of the old 
	Lama's private life, and they anoint the boy as<br>
	the new Lama (actually the old Lama in a new body). Do you think that dying 
	Lamas fly into new babies, or not?<br>
	<br>
	In China in the 1850s, a Christian convert said God appeared to him, told 
	him he was Jesus' younger brother, and commanded him to &quot;destroy demons.&quot; He 
	raised an army of believers who waged the Taiping Rebellion that killed 20 
	million people. Do you think he was Christ's<br>
	brother--or do you doubt it?<br>
	<br>
	Etc., etc. You get the picture.<br>
	<br>
	I'll bet there isn't a church member anywhere who doesn't think all those 
	supernatural beliefs are goofy--except for the one he or she believes.<br>
	<br>
	You see, by going through a laundry list of theologies, you can show that 
	the average Christian doubts 99 percent of the world's holy dogmas. But the 
	1 percent he believes is really no different than the rest. It's a system of 
	miraculous claims, without any reliable evidence to support it.<br>
	<br>
	So, if we can show people that some sacred &quot;truths&quot; are nutty, maybe 
	subconscious logic will seep through, and they'll realize that if some 
	magical beliefs are irrational, all may be.<br>
	<br>
	This progression is rather like a scene in the poignant Peter de Vries 
	novel, The Blood of the Lamb. In the book, a gushy woman compliments a Jew 
	because &quot;your people&quot; reduced the many gods of polytheism to just one god. 
	The man replies: &quot;Which is just a step from the truth.&quot;<br>
	<br>
	Meanwhile, it's encouraging to realize that almost everyone in the world is 
	a skeptic--at least about other people's religion.</font></p>
