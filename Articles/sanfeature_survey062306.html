	<i>While majorities in nearly every surveyed country responded that

	</i>&nbsp;<br>
	<b>SAN-Feature Service : -</b> Solid majorities of the American, French and 
	British publics hold favorable views of Muslims even as real differences 
	between Muslim and non-Muslim communities persist. The data appears in a 
	15-nation global attitudes survey released June 22 by The Pew Global 
	Attitudes Project, which describes the overall picture as &quot;more mixed than 
	unremittingly negative.&quot; &nbsp;Former Secretary of State Madeline K. Albright, 
	former U.S. Senator and Ambassador to the United Nations John C. Danforth 
	and Pew Research Center President Andrew Kohut analyzed the data at a 
	Washington press conference.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">A MIXED PICTURE &nbsp;While majorities in 
	nearly every surveyed country responded that relations between Muslims and 
	Westerners generally are bad, more specific questions revealed a more 
	nuanced pattern of inter-communal perceptions. Differences between European 
	and non-European Muslims suggest that frequent contact between communities 
	helps dispel negative stereotypes.&nbsp;While Western publics were divided on the 
	prospects for democracy in Muslim countries, solid and even overwhelming 
	majorities of Muslim respondents both in Europe and in Muslim countries held 
	that “democracy can work well” in most Muslim nations. The survey revealed 
	declining confidence in Osama bin Laden among most Muslim publics. The trend 
	is most pronounced in Jordan, where a November 2005 terrorist attack killed 
	63 and injured more than 100 people in Amman. Confidence in the al-Qaida 
	chief declined from 60 percent a year ago to just 24 percent now. Majorities 
	in Turkey, Egypt and Indonesia also express either &quot;not too much&quot; or &quot;no 
	confidence at all&quot; in bin Laden.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondents in Pakistan and in Nigeria, whose Muslim community 
	consistently expressed more radical opinions than publics in other Muslim 
	nations, offered bin Laden plurality or majority support.The percentage of 
	Muslims answering that suicide bombings and other violence against civilian 
	targets could be justified in some circumstances declined in Jordan, 
	Pakistan and Indonesia, but increased slightly in Turkey. Even so, nearly 
	three-in-ten Jordanian and Egyptian Muslims condoned suicide bombings, as 
	did one-in-seven Turkish, French, Spanish, British and Pakistani Muslims. 
	And majorities in Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt and Jordan ­ and 56 percent of 
	British Muslims ­ say they do not believe that groups of Arabs carried out 
	the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Muslims also were less likely than non-Muslims to perceive a 
	conflict between being a devout Muslim and living in what the poll framers 
	called a &quot;modern society.&quot;The data revealed other differences between the 
	two groups. Each tended to blame the other for perceived bad relations and 
	disagreed over the root causes underlying the recent controversy over 
	cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad in Denmark. Majorities in the United 
	States, France, Britain and Russia -- but not in Germany or Spain -- 
	expressed favorable views of Muslims. Majorities of Indonesians and 
	Jordanians -- but not Egyptians, Pakistanis or Turks -- expressed favorable 
	views of Christians. In every Muslim country surveyed, overwhelming or near 
	unanimous majorities expressed negative views toward Jews. The figure 
	reached 99 percent in Jordan, 98 percent in Egypt and 94 percent in 
	Pakistan. Twenty-eight percent of Jordanians and 22 percent of Egyptians 
	volunteered that &quot;Jews&quot; were to blame for bad relations between Muslims and 
	the West, although Jews were not mentioned in the question.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; European Muslims generally expressed more positive views 
	toward Christians and somewhat less negative views toward Jews than did 
	Muslims elsewhere. Senator Danforth called those figures &quot;evidence that 
	interaction helps. The more we know each other, the better off we are.&quot; The 
	recent controversy over publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet 
	Muhammad illustrated further differences between Muslims and non-Muslims. 
	Majorities throughout the West blamed &quot;Muslim intolerance&quot; for the dispute, 
	while even larger proportions of Muslims blamed &quot;Western disrespect.&quot;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary Albright suggested that policy differences over 
	Iraq, Israel/Palestine and the general turmoil in the Middle East 
	contributed to, but were not the sole cause, of difficult relations between 
	Muslims and the West. She suggested that policymakers make better use of 
	religious leaders both as resources for mutual understanding and as &quot;validators&quot; 
	capable of building public support for diplomatic arrangements. Danforth 
	said Muslim dislike of perceived Western values was a bigger factor. He 
	cited figures in which majorities of non-European Muslim respondents to the 
	Pew poll concluded that Westerners were selfish, arrogant and violent -- and 
	suggested that television and other mass media contributed to the 
	propagation of those views.<br>

	Global Attitudes Project is a series of worldwide public opinion surveys on 
	a broad array of subjects from people's assessments of their own lives to 
	their view about the current state of the world and important issues of the
