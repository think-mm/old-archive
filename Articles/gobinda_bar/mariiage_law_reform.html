	and Politics</strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Verdana"><strong>By
	<a href="../gobinda_bar">Gobinda Bar</a></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</span></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">The move by the Women and Children Affairs 
	Minister to amend the country’s marriage laws has drawn appreciation and 
	flak simultaneously. The rights groups, women organizations and progressive 
	people have welcome the move. On the other hand, some religion-based 
	political parties and clerics criticized it saying it is against the holy 
	book. It can clearly be envisaged that the reform measure will encounter 
	politicking. Besides the religious parties, an intra party politicking in 
	BNP may also jeopardize the reform process just like what happened with the 
	local government system laws. From the past records, we can hardly expect 
	that the move will draw support from the opposition without any politicking. 
	Because of the politicking, </span></strong>successive governments had 
	avoided tackling the issue for fear of hurting the religious sentiments of 
	the majority Muslim population. We must appreciate the initiative taken by 
	the Minister for Women and Children Affairs Khurshid Jahan Haque. But it is 
	not unlikely that she will be facing a lot of resistance and difficulties in 
	amending the law giving women the right to initiate divorce proceedings.&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</span></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">The focal point of the proposed changes 
	will be women’s right to divorce. </span></strong>Under existing Islamic <i>
	shariah</i> family and marriage laws, only men have the right to initiate 
	divorce proceedings. According to Islamic law a woman can express her desire 
	to her husband if she wants a divorce. But it depends on the husband whether 
	he would allow his wife to get that divorce. However a woman can ask for 
	divorce only under some limited conditions.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</span></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">Religionists argue that women enjoy a lot 
	of rights under the present legal system. The main point they are protesting 
	against is giving equal rights to women saying it would go against the 
	religious provisions. Bangladesh has ratified the CEDAW Charter that speaks 
	of giving men and women equal rights in all spheres of the state and 
	society. But the ratification has a loophole that the government didn’t 
	endorse sections 2 and 16 (C) terming those contrary to the existing <i>
	sharia</i>-based marriage law. But Muslim countries like Malaysia, Indonesia 
	even Saudi Arabia have ratified these. It can be conceived that other than 
	‘politics’ there is no bar to fully ratify the CEDAW charter. The present 
	brand of reactionary politics has always blocked the way of getting anything 
	better in our country. If any party wants to do anything better for the 
	people, the other party thwart the process to satisfy their vested interest. 
	So, anything good that could benefit the people always remains elusive.
	</span></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</span></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">Since 1984 when the CEDAW Charter 
	(excluding two of its clauses) was signed, no government took the initiative 
	to fully ratify it. This means both the Awami League and BNP government 
	stick to the explanation that the two said CEDAW clauses were against the <i>
	sharia</i>-based marriage law currently in effect in the country. Women 
	organizations have raised questions as to why the marriage laws have to be
	<i>sharia</i>-based while the other laws are secular and not in line with <i>
	sharia</i>. They argued that if the Muslim Family Law of 1963 could be 
	changed and amended, then why the marriage laws cannot be changed? In fact, 
	they say, these laws are against the Bangladesh constitution that ensures 
	equality of all its citizens irrespective of sex, religion, caste, creed etc 
	etc. </span></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">Religious zealots and some others would 
	argue that the existing laws don’t have any problem and they can fulfill the 
	needs of the time. They argue that social hegemony is the main obstacle to 
	implement those. The same sort of arguments was made by the educated and 
	elite people in the 19<sup>th</sup> century when Vidyasagar took the 
	initiative to enact law for remarriage of the Hindu widows. Along with the 
	vehement opposition by the orthodox quarters, some elites and pundits argued 
	that it was not a matter of law; rather it was a matter of social 
	consciousness. “We also want that the widows remarry but no law can ensure 
	this,” they said. These people actually didn’t want Vidyasagar to get 
	through. In today’s Bangladesh, there are many so called progressive people 
	who will also be opposing the move to amend the marriage laws citing the 
	baseless grounds and misleading the whole process.&nbsp; </span></strong></font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">The same thing has happened to the Hindu 
	marriage laws. The Hindus don’t register their marriages, thereby inviting 
	lots of problems in case of any discord in the conjugal life. The problems 
	are further compounded as they don’t have the provision to divorce. Taking 
	the privilege of a patriarchal society, the men take the advantage of 
	remarrying which the women are denied of. According to </span></strong>a 
	1946 law, Hindu women can file cases with courts to only regain the rights 
	to conjugal life. But they cannot ask for divorce. They do have limited 
	scopes to ask for separation. But t<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">hey 
	can neither divorce nor remarry. It is a commonplace that the Hindu women
	</span></strong>do not complain much fearing the marriage will break. </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">Human rights and women organizations have 
	been repeatedly arguing for a common secular law. Most of the laws including 
	the penal code are civil laws and the same law is applicable to all the 
	people. For the sake of democracy and good governance, there is no 
	alternative to develop and implement a unified law that treats everyone 
	equally. Without a unified legal system, our dream for a modern democratic 
	society will remain a far cry. It is the time to reconstitute and streamline 
	the state mechanisms when the monstrous religious extremism is growing fast 
	and eating into the very purpose of state. Our </span></strong>Minister for 
	Women and Children Affairs Khurshid Jahan Haque will definitely receive 
	thanks and appreciations for taking the initiative of reforming a particular 
	law. But people would expect the Prime Minister to direct the Ministry of 
	Law to initiate the process of developing a secular and unified legal system 
	now.<strong><span style="font-weight: normal"> </span></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</span></strong></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>
	<span style="font-weight: normal">But is there any honest will of our 
	political leaders to make things better? The records say, no.&nbsp; Neither the 
	Awami League nor BNP, (leave alone the military rulers), never took any 
	positive initiative to amend the questionable laws fearing consequences of 
	losing votes of religious zealots who are few in number compared to the 
	whole population. Rather, they made biased laws and oppressive provisions to 
	appease the zealots. Declaring a state religion, making laws based on 
	religions and intermingling religious elements into all the state affairs 
	are some examples. Both Awami League and BNP took the policy of appeasing a 
	few religious bigots instead of making good to hundreds of millions of the 
	citizens. Within these political parties, there are strong lobbies who 
	oppose progressive moves. Because of the entire state of affairs with the 
	main political parties, no positive moves can take a positive turn. In the 
	present situation, it seems that the political parties are the main 
	obstacles to democracy, human rights, good governance and people’s rights 
	and welfare. They must come out of this anti-people stand and work for the 
	common masses. Otherwise, the political parties themselves will continue to 
	be affected and the people will be victims of intimidation, terrorism, 
	harassment, sufferings and chaotic situations just like what are going 
	through in today’s Bangladesh. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></font></p>
