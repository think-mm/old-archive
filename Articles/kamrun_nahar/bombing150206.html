	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the whole world is ill with the violence of bombing, its 
	inauspicious paws and claws will overshadow the underdeveloped countries 
	much more profoundly than the richer ones, it is quite natural. Recently in 
	Bangladesh, ghastly bomb bursts occur in such places as are beyond people’s 
	imagination, though it is not an unusual phenomenon, when past records 
	exist. Hundreds either die or become disabled for life-time from such 
	heinous bomb-attacks; yet none seems to have any headache or anxiety on the 
	matter. When a heart-rending incident occurs, people of this poor region 
	soon react saying, “oh! No”. Then the next morning,
	they ask one another, “What happened yesterday?” <br>
	<br>
	None knows, what is going on, why and by whom but one thing is clear to 
	everyone that bombing is an evil power, with which sportive politicians are 
	playing a bloody game. No other means of political violence is so effective 
	in intimidating people as it is proven to be. So, political leaders use one 
	or a body of their own party activists, or hire one or a group of terrorists 
	to carry and drop bombs targeting either at an individual, people, place or 
	equipment.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana"><b>The testimony of the past</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In independence war of 1971, freedom-fighters used bombs and mines to 
	destroy
	culverts, barrages, police stations etc. aiming at the damage of 
	communication
	system among the foes. There is the evidence that they used hand-grenades 
	too
	in some operations. Thus people got the test, thrill and training of using 
	bombs to
	show negative power. From then until now, innumerable incidents of bombing
	have occurred in our country, though the attackers were from different 
	parties in
	different time.<br>
	<br>
	During the years of 1972-75, evidences of bombing incidents in different
	places of the country were found in the then newspapers. Government 
	supporters
	and communist extremists attacked with bombs on each other in clashes, 
	strikes,
	on party offices, government buildings, newspaper offices etc. Bomb attacks
	accelerated from January to March 1975 in Dhaka and many other places of the
	country.<br>
	<br>
	In the ruling period of Late President Ziaur Rahman, bomb-attacks continued
	in various places of the country. During the government of President H.M. 
	Ershad,
	lethal weapons were made available in the hands of student wings of the then
	ruling party Jatiya Party; so bomb explosions became common on the campus of
	Dhaka University in 1985. Again, blasts occurred in strikes while opposition
	movements geared up in order to overthrow autocratic ruler Ershad in 
	November
	1990. After 1990, these incidents somewhat lessened for some years but again
	accelerated from 1999 onwards.<br>

	<b><br>
	2005</b><br>
	<b>*Bomb-Blasts in 63 Districts: </b>It was the largest blast-incident in the 
	history of
	Bangladesh, which simultaneously broke out in 63 districts out of total 64 
	at a
	time in the 17th August. Different newspapers published different number of
	bomb-blasts and of the injured. According to four largest national 
	newspapers,
	these incidents of 300-500 blasts resulted in 2 killings and 100-200 
	injured. All
	bombs were targeted to intimidate government and people, and placed in 
	places
	of importance like the stair of Zia International Airport, Hotel Sheratan, 
	the
	Supreme Court (Dhaka) etc, but mainly aiming at courts and government
	establishments. With all bombs, leaflets were left in the name of a 
	government
	banned Islamic militant group named Jama’atul Mujahidin Bangladesh (JMB)
	demanding to the government for the replace of country’s democratic 
	judiciary
	with the Islamic Law.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Bomb-Attack on two judges: </b>A deadly bomb-attack took two valuable lives of
	two judges cruelly on November 14. They were Senior Assistant Judges of the
	District Judge Court of Jhalakati one named Sohel Ahmed Chowdhuri (35) and 
	the
	other named Jagannath Pare (32). On that day at 9 am, they were waiting for
	another judge by sitting in a microbus in front of the Judges’ Quarters 
	located in
	Officers’ Para of Jhalakati District City for going to the court. The 
	attacker Mamun,
	later arrested, threw a strong bomb inside the vehicle from a very close 
	distance.
	He was later identified as a member of the suicide-squad of a banned Islamic<br>
	militant organization named Jama’atul Mujahidin Bangladesh (JMB).<br>
	<br>
	<b>Suicide Bomb-Attack in the Court-Areas of Chittagong and Gajipur: </b>Members of the suicide-squad of JMB attacked on lawyers, police, and

	incident took 1 human life and injured 30 including 3 journalists, 7 
	policemen and

	with a
	tea-flask, inside of which he was bearing deadly bombs.<br>
	<b>Blast in front of Udichi and Shatadal: </b>A blast occurred in front of the

	Letter of JMB was recovered from the spot of blast in which JMB demanded to
	replace Islamic Law with Democratic judiciary in Bangladesh.<br>
	<br>
	</font><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF"><b>Reasons behind the scene</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	In Bangladesh, the violence of bombing was before and is still working on 
	even
	with more vile power. People expected that it would diminish gradually. But 
	the
	expectation still remains a dream and the panic of bombing never leaves this
	helpless region. Why? The curious mind tries to find some answers:<br>
	<b>1. The past Experience: </b>When a nation achieves liberation through a hard and
	bloody struggle, in post-independence period, it usually involves itself in 
	terrorism
	for some years. The reason is that, at the time of war, people get trained 
	to be
	unkind in taking heinous actions upon the foes. When the war is over, those
	experiences still work on their behaviors. Their taste for blood remains
	unchanged. Some nations can come out of this dark world by the right 
	direction
	of charismatic, honest and patriot political leaders, while others can’t, if
	unfortunately they are directed by the corrupted, selfish and deviated 
	leaders as
	has happened in case of Bangladesh for years endless. This is why 
	Maniruzzaman
	says, ‘Revolutionary mass upheaval generally weakens the people’s respect 
	for
	authority, law and discipline; and it brings in its wake social, economic 
	and
	political disorders.’<br>
	<b>2. Intolerance: </b>People submerging in extreme poverty may lose their patience
	to a greater extent. If a great number of these people are illiterate, they 
	may be
	more difficult to handle with. This is why the members of all political 
	parties in
	Bangladesh have least tolerance power. They can be ruthless and senseless in
	taking any means of violence, whether it is bombing or rather any worse 
	means,
	they don’t mind.<br>
	<b>3. Influence of International Terrorist Groups and Other Organizations:
	</b>Recent bombing incidents of Bangladesh are so pre-planned and 
	well-organized,
	it seems that, internal militants or extremists of political parties solely 
	can’t claim
	the responsibilities of those. Specialists argue that there is a linkage 
	between
	internal terrorists and external terrorists. Arms and finance are supplied 
	from the
	external world through this linkage. Among the international terrorist 
	groups,
	banned by US, the most notorious ones are Abu Shayef Group (Philippine),
	Jamia-Al-Islamia (Indonesia), Hammas, Harkatul Mujahidin, Hijbullah, 
	Al-Jihad,Al-Qayeda, Qumplun Mujahidin Malaysia etc. Some even claim, Indian 
	guerrillas
	have hands behind the bomb-attack in Sylhet. Some armed militant groups of
	Myanmar have been active in Chittagong Hill tracts for a long time. The 
	police
	and the detectives have found the connection between Rahinga militant groups
	and the native Islamic militant organizations, such as, JMB, Harkatul Jihad, 
	etc.
	Some Islamic NGOs including Revival of Islamic Heritage Society active in
	Bangladesh are under suspicion. Revival of Islamic Heritage Society of 
	Kuwait
	once worked in various countries as an assistant organization of Al-Qayeda. 
	The
	most wanted Islamic militant guru Bangla Bhai was once a member of Al-Qayeda,
	while got trained in Afghanistan. So, renowned political scientist Dr.Tareq
	Shamshur Rehman, in his article ‘Terrorism: From Dhaka to Baslan’ said that 
	the
	suspect about the linkage between external power(s) and the bombing 
	incidents
	of Bangladesh can’t be cancelled out.<br>
	<b>4. Ghosts of Foreign Countries:</b> Apprehension is high among the people and
	the analysts on that there may be shadows of the ghosts of foreign countries
	behind the bombing incidents, piloted in Bangladesh from the past to the 
	present.
	Who knows whether all those are not conspiracy cases, planned and backed by
	the upper hands of the governments of one or more countries? Their hidden
	motives may be to create chaos and turmoil inside this country, which will 
	benefit
	them by imposing their control over our social, economic and political 
	areas. In
	this relation, many refer to the names of some countries, such as India, 
	Pakistan,
	US, Saudi Arabia etc.<br>
	<b>5. Political Parties: </b>There is no doubt that many political parties were 
	involved
	in the cases of bomb-attacks in the past and are still working. For some 
	years
	after Liberation, the Sarbahara Party and other communist extremist groups
	piloted bomb-attacks separately in many places of the country. The leading
	political parties such as Awami League, B.N.P. Jatiya Party, Jamaat-I-Islami
	Bangladesh etc. also attacked on one another in many different times. 
	Presently,
	the names of various Islamic militant groups have been heard in the cases of
	bomb and grenade explosions for the last 5 years, such as Harkatul Zihad, 
	Hijbut
	Tahrir, Hijbut Taohit, Sahaba-Sainik Parishad, Talamiz-I-Islam, Jama’atul
	Mujahidin Bangladesh (JMB), Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB), etc.
	Many claim that Jama’atul Mujahidin Bangladesh (JMB), Harkatul Zihad, Ahle
	Hadith and other Islamic militant groups, which were involved in major 
	bombattacks
	in the last five years, are either secret wings of Jamaat-I-Islami
	Bangladesh or its patronized organizations. Generally all parties, either
	governmental or opposite, rear terrorists, who dare to commit any fatal 
	crime.<br>
	<b>6. The Torrents of Illegal Weapons and Ammunition:</b> The availability of
	weapons and ammunition can turn a sober nation into aggressive one. An
	illiterate and poor people, empowered by weapons, will be prone to 
	committing
	terrible crimes. At the time of war, Indian government supplied arms 
	including
	bombs, grenades and mines to freedom-fighters as well as trained them about
	how to use explosives. As a result of these, after liberation, 1972-1975 
	years
	were highly chaotic, and frequent bomb-bursts occurred all over the country.Even after the liberation, the supplies of illegal arms and ammunition were
	intruded in Bangladesh through Indian borders and are still getting 
	intruded.
	There is an evidence of the supply of illegal arms and ammunition including 
	233
	grenades, seized by the army in border areas in November, 1974.
	According to the detectives, there is a connection between the militant 
	Islamic
	groups of Sylhet and the extremist organization of India named ‘Tripura 
	National
	Volunteers’ (TNV). TNV sells its self-made bombs and collected grenades to 
	the
	militant groups of Bangladesh. It is hypothesized that these Islamic
	fundamentalist groups have used these bombs and grenades in the recent
	incidents.The largest Illegal supply of arms and ammunition in the history of the 
	country
	was seized from the wharf of Chittagong Urea Manure Mill by the high 
	officials of
	the police on April 1, 2004. With other seized weapons, there were 27 
	thousands
	and 20 grenades.<br>
	<br>
	From all these, it can be concluded that there must have been such many a 
	great
	number of Illegal arms and ammunition Supply which were never seized and 
	this
	process continues behind the eyes of people. So, terrorists are getting 
	those
	explosives in hands easily to do violence. Also news comes often in the 
	national
	dailies on the matter that bombs are being made in many places inside 
	secretly.
	For all these reasons, explosives have become easy to reach, and bombing
	incidents occur frequently.<br>
	<b>7. Law is a Dead Horse and Justice is its Broken Trappings: </b>When law is
	nothing but the written words, it is like a dead horse. And if law is 
	powerless,
	justice loses its beauty. It becomes then the means of injustice. Last five 
	years,
	25 major bomb-explosions were launched, but the Criminal Investigation
	Department (CID) could do a little except submitting final charge sheets and 
	the
	genuine culprits could flee from almost all cases.
	For the investigation of the grenade attack of August 21, 2004, five 
	intelligence
	agencies worked, such as, Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Detective
	Branch (DB), Special Branch (SB), National Security Intelligence (NSI), and
	Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI). Also, Rapid Action 
	Battalion
	(RAB) worked too. International organizations like INTERPOL and FBI assisted
	them. Yet the case still remained clueless, which proves that powerful 
	persons
	from inside and outside the country don’t want to reveal the truth. 
	Injustice and
	Lawlessness encourage offenders to do more violence.<br>
	<b>8 God Fathers: </b>The terrorists’ patrons, whom people call ‘God fathers’, are 
	the
	reasons of bomb-explosions behind the real actors. Late Siraj Shikdar, the 
	chief
	leader of the Sarbahara Party, was accused of many bomb-bursts between 1973
	and 1974.
	Maolana Habibur Rahman, Vice Chairman of Islamic Alliance Group, is 
	well-known
	as a religious extremist in the politics of Sylhet. There is a connection, 
	found by
	the detectives, between him and Mufti Hannan, accused of many bomb-explosion
	cases. Detectives conceive that a circle, led by these two leaders, is 
	involved in
	the plot of grenade-attack on the shrine (Mazar) of Hazrat Shah Jalal (R) in
	Sylhet.
	Two absconding leaders of the banned Islamic Militant Group named Jama’atul
	Mujahidin Bangladesh (JMB) are a real threat not only to the people living 
	in the
	North Bengal, but also to those of the whole country. Shayakh Abdur Rahman 
	is
	the central Amir of this group and Bangla Bhai is the operational chief of 
	JMB in
	the North Bengal. Though Bangla Bhai is active in Rajshahi and Naogaon 
	Districts
	giving his party name as Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB), it is a
	disguised name of Jama’atul Mujahidin. Another militant guru is Dr. Galib, 
	now
	kept in the police custody, who is the leader of another Islamic group named 
	Ahle
	Hadith working in 16 districts of the North Bengal as well as in Khulna, 
	Kustia,
	Jamalpur and Narayanganj. It is suspected that he is the spiritual leader of 
	the
	Jama’atul Mujahidin. These three militant gurus are inter-linked and their 
	three
	parties are nothing but three fake names of one Islamic militant group in
	disguise. It is now clear that they made their followers stage 
	bomb-explosions on
	August 17 (2005). Both the leaflets recovered from the spots of blasts 
	asking the
	government to establish Islamic Law and bomb explosions in courts prove that
	their aims of these blast incidents were to make pressure on government to
	release Dr. Galib, to take off the charges filed against Abdur Rahman and 
	Bangla
	Bhai, and to withdraw ban from their Islamic parties. It is predictable, 
	they can
	endanger the future of the inhabitants of this land seriously.
	In the South-West Bengal, the communist extremist groups are exercising
	violence being undaunted. Mrinal, leader of the New Revolutionary Communist
	Party, Main Jamaddar, leader of a killer group, and Shoeb and Suman, daring
	cadres of Janayudda, are the kings of terrorism in the south-west zone. 
	Recently
	Mrinal died by the cross-fire of RAB. The extremist communists are accused 
	of
	killing Humayun Kabir Balu by bombing on June 27, 2004. Balu was the editor 
	of
	a local newspaper of Khulna named ‘the Daily Janmabhumi’. Before five and 
	half
	months of this killing, another journalist of Khulna, named Manik Saha was 
	killed
	in the same way. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Besides, among many top-terrorists and other criminals, listed or not listed 
	by the
	police, absconders and free-walkers may be implicated in separate bombing
	incidents all over the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Therefore, it is clear, God Fathers explode bombs in their own areas by 
	their
	retinues, though they may be involved in other cases too outside their local
	regions.<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font face="Verdana" color="#0000FF">How to manage</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
	</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
	The situation in Bangladesh is grave and threatening but not yet out of the
	control. If certain steps are taken with sagacity, further crisis will not 
	arise with
	irresistible appearance. Here, some recommendations are provided.<br>
	<b>1. High Alerts in Borders and Ports</b>: Illegal arms, terrorists and ammunition
	enter the country through borders and ports. So, deployment of high police
	officers, detectives and the army is necessary in those areas to watch over 
	illegal
	activities of illegal traders and to catch them red-handed.<br>
	<b>2. Ban on the Illegal Production of Explosives: </b>Newspapers’ reports show
	that terrorists often make explosives clandestinely in many places inside 
	the
	country, which is highly threatening to peace-situation. To stop this crime, 
	special
	police branches, such as, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), Cobra, Cheetah etc,
	appointed by the BNP government, should continue investigation without being
	biased.<br>
	<b>3. Proper Wages and Training for the Police:</b> Little wages of the police has
	forced them to be involved in crimes in unison with the terrorists. People 
	are
	confused why the police is reacting strangely on the bombing-case of August 
	21,
	2004. Also, the police have failed to catch the real culprits accused of the 
	major bombing
	incidents, staged before or may have helped them to flee; who knows,
	what the truth is. Proper wages, which will suffice them, and proper 
	training may
	make them dutiful. And it will reduce terrorism largely.<br>
	<b>4. Marking Crime-zones: </b>Government should mark some areas as crime-zones
	so that it can give more attention to improve law and order situation of 
	those
	areas and can seize the absconders, such as, Dhaka, Khulna, the Forest
	Sundarban, inaccessible parts of Chittagong Hill Tracts, where training 
	camps of
	Islamic militants were already found. In those areas, more army and police
	should be deployed.<br>
	<b>5. Responsibilities of the Ministry:</b> For long years, terrorists have thriven
	under the shade of ministers. Many ministers and MPs rear terrorists, 
	keeping
	them untouched by law like the mother of birds. If the Judiciary is 
	separated from
	the Executive and if it independently carries on prosecution against the 
	involved
	ministers and MPs, the unlawful situation of the country will improve 
	significantly.<br>
	<b>6. Modern Spying Technology:</b> We need to improve our spying technology as
	much as possible. At first, we need to export some technology and equipment
	from abroad. Then, we have to build up our own mechanisms. Digital audio
	recorders can be used in telephone sets in order to record secret 
	conversations of
	national and international terrorists. In big cities, miniature digital 
	auto-cameras
	can be set on the streets to watch over the movements of criminals.<br>
	<b>7. Ban on Religious Political Parties: </b>All kinds of religious political 
	parties
	should be banned immediately. Intolerance and violence accrue from religious
	politics, as we have seen in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan etc. Analyzing the 
	major
	bomb-explosions from 1999 to 2004, detectives have found some similarities
	between these incidents and that is the places of attack are of a common 
	class,
	as, cinema halls, cultural ceremonies, mazar (shrine) etc. Islamic militant 
	groups
	count these places as the centers of un-Islamic activities. So they may have<br>
	targeted them to destroy culturally and finally. If religious politics isn’t 
	banned,
	these unexpected incidents may not be avoided.<br>
	<b>8. Friendly Relation and Consensus:</b> Friendly Relation and Consensus between
	the government and all other opposite political parties about common 
	national
	issues can help improve the whole situation dramatically. If the enmity 
	between
	them goes on, revengeful bombing attacks will be repeated.<br>
	<b>9. Imprisonment of Terrorists:</b> As long as the top terrorists and their 
	retinues
	are roaming outside like phantoms with free hands, the country is more
	dangerous than a forest. Better it is as early as the police arrest them and 
	send
	them to jail. But if ministers help them to get bails, what is in practice 
	in our
	country for long, all endeavors to stop any kind of violence including 
	bombing will
	be meaningless.<br>
	<b>10. Reduction of Unemployment: </b>There is a saying that an empty brain is the
	working place of the Satan. The young generation has now gone astray being
	depressed from unemployment-status. If statistics is counted down correctly, 
	it
	will be proved that none but the young are generating violence practically 
	in the
	field. As long as more public and private industries are established 
	creating more
	posts, incidents of explosions or others will not stop.<br>
	<b>11. Values and Patriotism: </b>The degradation of values within all classes of
	people is the chief cause of many-sided and devastating violent activities. 
	People
	have a very little concern about what they do. They are destroying 
	themselves
	and their property by bombing without any hesitation. Mass-media can work
	together to develop values and patriotism of people. Specially radio, TV,
	newspapers can be the most helpful in this ground. They can use some 
	sentences
	in daily advertisements to build rapport inside citizens for the country. 
	Special<br>
	Training of values should be compulsory for the police and other branches 
	related
	to law and order. In foreign countries, there are special courses for 
	criminals to
	develop their mental conditions. This will fit for our prisoners in this 
	critical
	condition of the country.<br>
	<b>12. Enlightened People: </b>As Professor Abu Sayid says, we need enlightened
	people now. An illiterate nation can be more aggressive than the literate 
	one. This
	is the reason why bombing incidents seldom occur in Australia, Europe and
	America, when it is common in Africa and Asia. Ruling and opposition 
	political
	parties hire people, mainly youths and adolescents, for picketing on the 
	street in
	the day of strikes and these people’s behaviors are really savage. If these 
	millions
	of people are enlightened by education, the destructive activities will 
	reduce to a
	greater degree.<br>
	<br>
	</font><b><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">Last words</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
	<br>
	Life is no more secure in this poor land, rather shadowed by an evil power 
	named
	bombing, which some wretches are using as the strongest means of political
	violence. None knows what will happen next to him. It is as though one kind 
	of
	civil war. Some mentally sick persons of the same nation are taking the test 
	of
	the blood of their own brothers. Bombings not only take huge lives and leave
	huge people unproductive, but also destroy the national wealth, which push 
	back
	the country to some years. This is not the time for blaming each other. In 
	this
	critical moment, expectation lays on one thing that government and other
	political parties will work together and behave in the democratic way 
	discarding
	personal egos, enmity and hatred and a consensus on how to face this crisis 
	is
	the first necessity. This only can bring end in this dark period. We hope 
	for the
	starry night in Bangladesh flamed with the heavenly light of conscience, not
	soaked with blood and brutality.</font></p>
