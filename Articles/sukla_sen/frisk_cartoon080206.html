	threats of violence against a painting of Bharat Mata (Mother India) in the 
	nude by M. F. Hussain - the most famous living Indian painter, now in his 
	eighties. They had earlier resorted to large-scale violence and vandalism 
	protesting against his paintings of Sraraswati - the Hindu goddess of 
	learning, and Sita - a revered mythological female character from the famous 
	epic Ramayana, in the nude. The Hindu militants had also obstructed and 
	vandalised the shows of the much acclaimed film 'Fire' by Deepa Mehta - 
	depicting lesbian relationship between two women in the same family, and 
	made her scrap her original attempt to film the 'Water' - dealing with the 
	sexual and other exploitations of Hindu widows condemned to the status of 
	destitute in the olden days, in India itself. The film had to be 
	subsequently made with a changed cast in neighbouring, predominantly 
	Buddhist, Sri Lanka. Quite interestingly, these people are pretty much 
	vociferous against the current spate of Islamist protests in reaction to the 
	Danish cartoons.</span></font></p>

	<p><font face="Verdana" color="#990000" size="+3">S</font><font face="Verdana" size="-1">o 
	now it's cartoons of the Prophet Mohamed with a bomb-shaped turban. 
	Ambassadors are withdrawn from Denmark, Gulf nations clear their shelves of 
	Danish produce, Gaza gunmen threaten the European Union. In Denmark, Fleming 
	Rose, the &quot;culture&quot; editor of the pip-squeak newspaper which published these 
	silly cartoons--last September, for heaven's sake--announces that we are 
	witnessing a &quot;clash of civilisations&quot; between secular Western democracies 
	and Islamic societies. This does prove, I suppose, that Danish journalists 
	follow in the tradition of Hans Christian Anderson. Oh lordy, lordy. What 
	we're witnessing is the childishness of civilisations.<br>
	<br>
	So let's start off with the Department of Home Truths. This is not an issue 
	of secularism versus Islam. For Muslims, the Prophet is the man who received 
	divine words directly from God. We see our prophets as faintly historical 
	figures, at odds with our high-tech human rights, almost cariacatures of 
	themselves. The fact is that Muslims live their religion. We do not. They 
	have kept their faith through innumerable historical vicissitudes. We have 
	lost our faith ever since Matthew Arnold wrote about the sea's &quot;long, 
	withdrawing roar&quot;. That's why we talk about &quot;the West versus Islam&quot; rather 
	than &quot;Christians versus Islam&quot;--because there aren't an awful lot of 
	Christians left in Europe. There is no way we can get round this by setting 
	up all the other world religions and asking why we are not allowed to make 
	fun of Mohamed.<br>
	<br>
	Besides, we can exercise our own hypocrisy over religious feelings. I happen 
	to remember how, more than a decade ago, a film called The Last Temptation 
	of Christ showed Jesus making love to a woman. In Paris, someone set fire to 
	the cinema showing the movie, killing a young man. I also happen to remember 
	a US university which invited me to give a lecture three years ago. I did. 
	It was entitled &quot;September 11, 2001: ask who did it but, for God's sake, 
	don't ask why&quot;. When I arrived, I found that the university had deleted the 
	phrase &quot;for God's sake&quot; because &quot;we didn't want to offend certain 
	sensibilities&quot;. Ah-ha, so we have &quot;sensibilities&quot; too.<br>
	<br>
	In other words, while we claim that Muslims must be good secularists when it 
	comes to free speech--or cheap cartoons--we can worry about adherents to our 
	own precious religion just as much. I also enjoyed the pompous claims of 
	European statesmen that they cannot control free speech or newspapers. This 
	is also nonsense. Had that cartoon of the Prophet shown instead a chief 
	rabbi with a bomb-shaped hat, we would have had &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; screamed 
	into our ears--and rightly so--just as we often hear the Israelis complain 
	about anti-Semitic cartoons in Egyptian newspapers.<br>
	<br>
	Furthermore, in some European nations--France is one, Germany and Austria 
	are among the others--it is forbidden by law to deny acts of genocide. In 
	France, for example, it is illegal to say that the Jewish Holocaust or the 
	Armenian Holocaust did not happen. So it is, in fact, impermissable to make 
	certain statements in European nations. I'm still uncertain whether these 
	laws attain their objectives; however much you may prescribe Holocaust 
	denial, anti-Semites will always try to find a way round. We can hardly 
	exercise our political restraints to prevent Holocaust deniers and then 
	start screaming about secularism when we find that Muslims object to our 
	provocative and insulting image of the Prophet.<br>
	<br>
	For many Muslims, the &quot;Islamic&quot; reaction to this affair is an embarrassment. 
	There is good reason to believe that Muslims would like to see some element 
	of reform introduced to their religion. If this cartoon had advanced the 
	cause of those who want to debate this issue, no-one would have minded. But 
	it was clearly intended to be provocative. It was so outrageous that it only 
	caused reaction.<br>
	<br>
	And this is not a great time to heat up the old Samuel Huntingdon garbage 
	about a &quot;clash of civilisations&quot;. Iran now has a clerical government again. 
	So, to all intents and purposes, does Iraq (which was not supposed to end up 
	with a democratically elected clerical administration, but that's what 
	happens when you topple dictators). In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood won 20 
	per cent of the seats in the recent parliamentary elections. Now we have 
	Hamas in charge of &quot;Palestine&quot;. There's a message here, isn't there? That 
	America's policies--&quot;regime change&quot; in the Middle East--are not achieving 
	their ends. These millions of voters were preferring Islam to the corrupt 
	regimes which we imposed on them.<br>
	<br>
	For the Danish cartoon to be dumped on top of this fire is dangerous indeed.<br>
	<br>
	In any event, it's not about whether the Prophet should be pictured. The 
	Koran does not forbid images of the Prophet even though millions of Muslims 
	do. The problem is that these cartoons portrayed Mohamed as a bin Laden-type 
	image of violence. They portrayed Islam as a violent religion. It is not. Or 
	do we want to make it so?</font></p>
