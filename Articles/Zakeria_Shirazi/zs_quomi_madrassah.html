							<font size="2">Quality of education, or of anything 
							for that matter, has to be achieved by sedulous 
							efforts over time. Quality does not come by any 
							peremptory declaration/announcement/recognition. <br>
							<br>
							As for <i>madrassah </i>education, for decades the 
							issue was reform and updating, modernizing of its 
							curriculum, fostering an attitudinal change of <i>
							madrassah</i> students and making them more capable 
							of coping with the needs or a modern scientifically 
							oriented society. <br>
							<br>
							This had been the feeling of intelligent segments of 
							society in the years when <i>madrassah</i> chiefly 
							meant <i>aliya madrassah,</i> an old and established 
							institution recognized by the government and 
							administered by <i>madrassah</i> board. It was 
							expected that as with time the political system made 
							some progress towards democracy, society as a whole 
							would be gradually modernized and eventually 
							multiple systems of education would give place to 
							one uniform educational system, without prejudice to 
							the rights of those who opted for religion-based 
							curriculum. <br>
							<br>
							The utility and desirability of <i>madrassah </i>
							education in the existing form was debated even 
							during autocratic regimes. There was also the 
							economic side to be considered. <b>It was once 
							estimated that government expenditure on a <i>
							madrassah</i> student was much higher than the 
							amount spent on a student of a government secondary 
							school. </b>Of course this applied to <i>aliya 
							madrassah</i> only. <br>
							<br>
							However, the progressive social activists were 
							unwilling to press the economic point too far, 
							recognizing that after all the beneficiaries of the 
							government subsidy were almost exclusively 
							underprivileged students.<br>
							<br>
							Things have changed vastly since then. Money is not 
							the problem, as far as <i>madrassahs</i> are 
							concerned. <b>The <i>Qoumi madrassah</i> leaders are 
							saying they don’t want government money, only a 
							recognition that their education, quality-wise, is 
							at a par with university education. The source of 
							money, its conduit and outlet are like the ghost in 
							a banquet – everyone feels its presence but no one 
							wants to talk about it. </b><br>
							<br>
							As for <i>Qoumi madrassah,</i> its very name implies 
							it is a loose organization, a community enterprise 
							(‘qoumi’ means community-based). In recent years <i>
							qoumi madrassahs</i> have proliferated. No one 
							perhaps even knows their actual number and location 
							of each of them. Some recently established ones are 
							found to be located at sequestered places. It is not 
							known whether they have their own controlling body. 
							Even if there is a controlling body it is unable to 
							make all the units accountable. <br>
							<br>
							In recent events of bomb blasting when so many 
							reports of indirect links of <i>qoumi madrassahs</i> 
							with terrorism were pouring in, no organization came 
							out proposing to reform the <i>madrassahs</i> 
							internally or to call them to account. <b>Far from 
							promising to reform some religious leaders held out 
							threats of dire consequences if anything were done 
							not palatable to leaders of <i>qoumi madrassahs.</i>
							</b>In other words, many if not most of these 
							seminaries are self-governed. <br>
							<br>
							And these are not even registered with the 
							government. Hence government is going to recognize 
							the certificates of the <i>madrassahs</i> and treat 
							them as equivalent to university degrees even though 
							the government has not registered them. The question 
							then naturally arises as to what is the government’s 
							approach to the country’s universities and higher 
							education. The pressing agenda before the education 
							authorities is to halt further deterioration of 
							university education and to make their degrees 
							internationally respected as before. <br>
							<br>
							If we ourselves devalue, relatively, an MA degree of 
							Dhaka University, how much respect will these 
							degrees gain abroad? Some quarters therefore regard 
							the move of treating <i>Dawrah</i> certificate on 
							the same level as university degree as 
							anti-education.<br>
							<br>
							First the <i>qoumi madrassah</i> or any other <i>
							madrassah</i> will have to acquire at the minimum 
							the standard of <i>aliya madrassah,</i> the 
							recognized mainstream <i>madrassah;</i> further 
							recognition can come much later. And are all of them 
							teaching even the religion-based curriculum of <i>
							aliya madrassah?</i> Although the government chose 
							to look the other way, investigations by the media 
							and some other watchful groups in the context of 
							recent happenings made frightful disclosures. <b>
							Afghan <i>mujahids</i> are working as trainers in 
							many <i>qoumi madrassahs,</i> some are teaching 
							militancy, prescribing war criminal Gholam Azam’s 
							books as text and stuffing the minds of youngsters 
							with perverse religious doctrines, far removed from 
							the tolerance and humanism and universality upheld 
							by Islam and promoted by the saints and savants who 
							visited and stayed and taught in this country in the 
							days of yore. The primary problem before the nation 
							is not the value of the <i>Dawra</i> degree but the 
							information gap on the <i>qoumi madrassahs,</i> what 
							they are, where they are, what they teach, where 
							they get the money.</b><br>
							<br>
							Religious education is an alternative educational 
							system. Whether multiple systems should ideally 
							prevail in a country is another matter. Those who 
							have chosen to go in for religious education should 
							give expression to their genius in their chosen 
							field instead of seeking equality with another 
							field. And if equality of BA/MA is their desire and 
							they value the mainstream education then they should 
							have chosen at the beginning the system which leads 
							to BA/MA. Why choose to become BA/MA via another 
							route?<br>
							<br>
							This is not the first time that the government has 
							taken a move which is incredible and irrational. In 
							this case there is an explanation. <b>There are two 
							obvious factors responsible for the government 
							agreeing to treat the <i>Dawra</i> ‘degree’ on a 
							higher level. The fundamentalists have gained 
							tremendous strength and all their cravings must be 
							fulfilled, even if it means torpedoing the education 
							system, reversing the progress in manpower 
							development and falling back in the competitive 
							world and plunging society into the depth of 
							obscurantism. The second motive arises from a 
							built-in flaw of democracy itself: the potential 
							voters must be appeased even if it means gong 
							downhill. </b><br>
							<br>
							The fight against obscurantism has not been easy on 
							the part of democratic rulers and their reform 
							agenda has not always accorded with people’s 
							ingrained prejudices. Despite this limitation of 
							democracy, obscurantist masses have not been able to 
							pull down all modernization programs. In the case of 
							great leaders patriotism often prevails and they 
							resist the temptation of giving in to the lure of 
							the ballot when vital national interests are at 
							stake. In our case it seems the leaders are more 
							single-minded in their wooing of voters and can 
							spare no thought or sight for secondary concerns. 
							And in this case it is not just failure to counter 
							obscurantist forces but a straight capitulation to 
							them and extending to them an invitation to take 
							over positions of power without having to raise 
							their capability. Appeasement is the simplest of all 
							prescriptions, going downhill is so easy.<br>
							<br>
							It must be conceded that <i>madrassah</i> education 
							is not invariably a journey towards doom and there 
							is enough scope for reform. One plus point of the <i>
							madrassahs</i> is that many of them run orphanages 
							which feed and clothe the poor and deserted ones and 
							the foundlings and provide them a roof overhead. It 
							is an odd fact of welfare service in this country 
							that private orphanages are all <i>madrassah</i>-based.
							<br>
							<br>
							Why the secular philanthropists cannot establish any 
							orphanage? <b>That <i>madrassah</i> education is not 
							inherently crippling is evident from the fact that 
							many educated and distinguished Bengali Muslims of 
							the earlier generations were products of <i>
							madrassahs.</i> In the case of some select <i>
							madrassahs</i> of India no praise will be too much.
							</b><br>
							<br>
							A fact not widely known here is that there are <i>
							madrassahs</i> in north India where one-third of 
							students and one-fourth of teaching staff are 
							Hindus. This is because these <i>madrassahs</i> are 
							welfare-oriented and provide a reasonable standard 
							of education not too far removed from the mainstream 
							courses so that the underprivileged Hindus find them 
							more attractive than the government schools which 
							too these days provide free midday meal any way. If 
							the <i>madrassahs</i> are spending money on 
							underprivileged children, that’s fine but spend the 
							money, public or private, the right way.</font></span></font></div>
