	Intelligent Design theory</a>: A modern version of creationism</span></b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The so-called Intelligent Design theory is a modern 
	version of creationism, mostly indigenous for the USA but also having allies 
	and offshoots in Europe, Australia, and Asia, in particular enjoying a 
	substantial measure of support and popularity in its Islamic version. It is 
	based on the assumption that the universe in general and biological life in 
	particular are too complex and too highly “specified” to have come into 
	existence “by chance” and therefore must be products of purposeful action by 
	an intelligent “designer.” </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although intelligent design theory has been 
	motivated mainly by the religious fervor of its advocates, intelligent 
	design “theorists” present it as a “scientific” theory.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its most recent rendition, intelligent 
	design theory entered the discourse in the early 1990s as a more 
	sophisticated version of creationism than its predecessors (such as the 
	“creation science” by young earth creationists).&nbsp; Creation science in the 
	USA suffered legal defeats, including the 1987 Supreme Court ruling in <i>
	Edwards vs. Aguillard</i> and some other courts’ decisions which determined 
	that creation science is not science but religious dogma and therefore, as 
	per <i>the establishment clause</i> <i>of the first amendment</i> to the 
	Constitution of the USA, can’t be taught in public schools science classes.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advocates of intelligent design have 
	partially abandoned the most egregious absurdities of creation science (such 
	as the assertion that the 2<sup>nd</sup> law of thermodynamics makes 
	evolution impossible). The key figures of intelligent design theory are 
	often well educated, sport advanced degrees from prestigious universities, 
	and use argumentation which is suffused with mathematical symbolism, 
	accompanied with references to real scientific sources, and often looks 
	impressive on the face of it. Nevertheless, the scientific community has 
	overwhelmingly rejected intelligent design theory, viewing it as just a 
	better-packaged creationism (referring to it as “creationism in a cheap 
	tuxedo,” “stealth creationism,” and the like).</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligent design theory is essentially a 
	more elaborate and refined version of the “argument from design” which has a 
	long tradition. One of early renditions of the argument from design was 
	offered by a British clergyman William Paley (1802).&nbsp; According to Paley, if 
	you find a watch on the ground, nobody would assume that such a complex 
	contraption, whose multiple parts are well-matched and perform a specific 
	function, could have emerged spontaneously (“by chance”).&nbsp; A watch displays 
	features of a purposeful design. Paley’s argument proceeded to claim that 
	“if there is a watch, there must be a watchmaker.” &nbsp;Since the universe is 
	immensely more complex than a watch and also features an intricate clocklike 
	order, thus displaying the signs of design, Paley’s idea extends to the 
	universe the assertion that “if there is design, there must be a designer.”&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Paley and many of his followers, the 
	designer was unequivocally identified as the God of the Christian Bible. For 
	the proponents of the Islamic version of intelligent design the designer is 
	the Allah. However, in modern versions of argument from design, like the 
	intelligent design theory, the identity of the designer is often 
	deliberately left undetermined, or sometimes is assumed to be some entity of 
	an extra-terrestrial origin, as in the Raëlian cult (Raël 1974). </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument from design had already been 
	shown to be philosophically deficient by the British philosopher David Hume 
	(1777) but has nevertheless recrudesced time and time again since the 
	publication of Paley’s book.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Essentially, the argument from design is 
	tantamount to the argument from improbability: the spontaneous emergence of 
	a complex contraption such as a watch has an exceedingly small probability, 
	therefore its existence supposedly must lead to a design inference. </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The estimation of probability depends on 
	our knowledge about the situation. If we possess a complete knowledge of a 
	situation, we deal with certainties rather than probabilities. The 
	incomplete knowledge is what forces us to resort to estimation of 
	probabilities. In other words, probability estimations depend on the level 
	of ignorance about a situation. Therefore argument from design is in fact a 
	version of the <i>argument from ignorance. </i>It also is known as the <i>
	God-of-the-gaps</i> argument.&nbsp; Whenever there are gaps in the knowledge 
	available through scientific means, the <i>God-of-the gaps</i> approach 
	invokes a reference to a supposedly supernatural source of the unknown 
	contents of a “gap.”&nbsp; However, as science progresses, the gaps in the 
	knowledge are gradually filled up, thus removing supernatural attributions 
	one by one. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paley’s argument from design has a number 
	of serious weaknesses. One such weakness of the argument from design is the 
	problem of infinite regress. If the universe and/or biological life are 
	products of a purposeful design, the natural question is: who designed the 
	designer?&nbsp; If the probability of the universe’s existence by chance is 
	extremely small, so must be the probability of the existence of its creator, 
	as well as that of the “creator’s creator,” and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. 
	&nbsp;The adherents of the argument from design are unwilling to accept infinite 
	regress and maintain that, unlike nature, the Creator has had no beginning 
	and therefore needs no “super-creator.”&nbsp; If, however, we refuse to accept 
	infinite regress, the principle of parsimony (also referred to as Occam’s 
	razor) which states that the simplest assumption is always preferable to a 
	more complex one, makes unreasonable the hypothesis of the existence of a 
	supernatural creator. The question of whether natural world had or had not a 
	beginning is irrelevant in this respect even only because the assumption 
	that the Creator has had no beginning has no factual basis but is only an 
	arbitrary ad-hoc postulate invoked to compensate for the lack of evidence.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more weakness of the argument from 
	design can be illustrated as follows. Slightly modify Paley’s argument. 
	Imagine that we find a watch, say, on some uninhabited planet, like Mars. 
	Again, we see a contraption consisting of well-matched parts performing a 
	function. It must have been designed, right? However, there are no 
	watchmakers on that planet. So we must conclude that perhaps humans used to 
	visit that planet before, or that human-like creatures used to exist on that 
	planer in the past. Why do we come to such a conclusion? &nbsp;Because the watch 
	is complex and functional?&nbsp; It is easy to see that the reason is different. 
	Say, we find on the same planet an apple tree. An apple is immensely more 
	complex than a watch and the tree produces this complex entity by a complex 
	and well organized process wherein many parts of the tree are well matched. 
	However, unlike with a watch, we will not conclude that the apple tree was 
	designed by humans.&nbsp; Following Paley, we have to conclude that the apple 
	tree was designed by a supernatural creator. Why the conclusions are 
	different while both a watch and a tree equally display signs of design? For 
	one reason only: we have experience which tells us that all watches have 
	been designed and made by humans. So, when we see a watch, we recognize a 
	human-designed artifact. However, when we see a biological organism, we 
	possess no experience pointing to it being an artifact, i.e. a product of a 
	human design. The analogy between the recognizable features of a human 
	design in a watch and the seeming design of biological objects is 
	superficial and has no factual foundation. Our ignorance of the origin of 
	biological objects or of the features of the universe is not a sufficient 
	reason to assume the existence of a supernatural “designer” for which there 
	is no evidence. The jump from the reasonable attribution of a watch to a 
	human design to the arbitrary attribution of, say, biological organisms or 
	certain features of the universe to a supernatural, never observed, designer 
	is a logical fallacy. </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">The recent&nbsp; resurgence of activity of the intelligent 
	design “theorists” acquired vigor with the publication of a book <i>Darwin 
	on Trial</i> by an academic lawyer Phillip Johnson (1991). Its main content

	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Darwin on Trial</i>, and in a series 
	of subsequent publications, Johnson covered a number of points, rejecting 
	essentially all the tenets of “Darwinism.” Johnson and his followers apply 
	the term “Darwinism” or “Darwin’s theory” as if no development took place in 
	biological sciences during about 150 years after Charles Darwin published 
	his famous <i>On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection</i>. In 
	fact biological sciences have experienced an enormous development since 
	Darwin. The knowledge accumulated after Darwin is immense. In particular, an 
	important part of the modern evolutionary biology is genetics which did no 
	exist in Darwin’s time and which has shed light on the mechanism of 
	hereditary trends. What has to be stated, though, is that despite certain 
	amendments to Darwin’s original concepts, the main core of Darwin’s ideas 
	has received amazingly strong empirical confirmation, such that the main 
	aspect of Darwin’s theory – descent with modification – has been firmly 
	accepted by the overwhelming majority of biologists. Many crucial 
	innovations in medicine, agriculture, pharmaceutical science, and even in

	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson, however, attempted an attack on 
	many facets of Darwinism (i.e. on evolutionary biology).&nbsp; One such aspect is 
	the alleged critical distinction between “microevolution” and 
	“macroevolution.”&nbsp; The term “microevolution” in the usage of intelligent 
	design advocates refers to the changes biological organisms undergo without 
	producing new species and hence also no taxonomic groups above the species.&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most intelligent design advocates accept 
	microevolution as a fact (for example, the development of strains of 
	bacteria resistant to antibiotics, or creating various breeds of dogs). What 
	the intelligent design advocates, including Johnson, deny, is 
	“macroevolution” (which in terms of evolutionary biology is usually referred 
	to as <i>speciation</i>) i.e. the development of new species or larger 
	taxonomic categories as a result of descent with modification. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolutionary biology denies any substantive 
	difference between “micro-“ and “macroevolution.” The process entailing 
	random mutations in the genome, accompanied by natural selection (and/or by 
	a number of other mechanisms studied by evolutionary biology) is not 
	restrained by any limits preventing the emergence of new species. When 
	enough differences accumulate in the genome through mutations, and the novel 
	forms of organisms happen to be geographically separated from their 
	progenitor form, or otherwise prevented from interbreeding with the 
	progenitor population, the new offspring may become <i>biologically</i> 
	incapable of interbreeding with the progenitor species, so a new species 
	emerges. The actual occurrence of speciation has been well established in 
	the biological science and the biological literature contains many examples 
	of speciation both in plants and animals.&nbsp; Johnson and his supporters simply 
	deny facts when they assert the alleged absence of evidence in favor of 
	speciation. (See, for example, Coyne and Orr, 2004).</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point Johnson construes as an 
	argument against “Darwinism” is the “Cambrian explosion.” In fact, 
	evolutionary biology comfortably accounts for the Cambrian explosion, which 
	was the emergence of new groups of organisms in the course of <i>relatively
	</i>short period of time (about 10 million years) some 540 million years 
	ago. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson also offers some philosophical 
	arguments, suggesting that the theory of natural selection is just tautology 
	and that Darwin’s theory is based on “circular reasoning.”&nbsp; These points in 
	Johnson’s output have been repudiated as philosophically invalid even by 
	some philosophers from his own camp (Ratzsch 2001).</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professional biologists have overwhelmingly 
	rejected Johnson’s arguments. In particular, a critique of Johnson’s book, 
	reflecting a consensus of biologists, was published by the prominent expert 
	in evolution theory, Stephen Jay Gould (1992). It was followed by other 
	critical reviews of Johnson’s literary output from various standpoints (see, 
	for example Miller 1999 or Perakh 2004).&nbsp; Nevertheless Johnson’s book, with 
	its lawyer’s style of arguments, delivered with a considerable eloquence, 
	has gained wide popularity among religiously inclined audience. This 
	audience found in Johnson’s book what they considered a much desired 
	repudiation of evolution theory which has been (or seemed to be) at odds 
	with religious beliefs. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Johnson has claimed himself and as was 
	acknowledged more than once by his followers, he “assumed the leading role”

	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early nineties Johnson was

	Discovery Institute of Seattle, Washington. The Discovery Institute is a

	<font face="Verdana">A milestone in the Intelligent Design movement was the 
	publication of the book <i>Darwin’s Black Box</i> by a professor of 
	biochemistry at Lehigh University, Michael J. Behe (1996). Behe is one of 
	only a few intelligent design advocates who are genuine scientists, with a 
	reasonable (although modest) record of publications in peer-reviewed 
	journals. The book in question is, though, not a scientific monograph, but 
	rather a popular tale addressing general audience, and has little relation 
	to Behe’s biochemical research. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his book Behe introduced the concept of
	<i>irreducible complexity</i> of molecular assemblies in biological cells.&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Behe, a system is irreducibly 
	complex if it performs a certain function (for example clots blood) and 
	consists of such well matched indispensable parts that the removal of even a 
	single part results in the system’s losing its function. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behe suggested that an irreducibly complex 
	system could not have evolved via a Darwinian path (which entails random 
	mutations and natural selection).&nbsp; Indeed, asserted Behe, Darwinian 
	evolution works only on existing functioning systems. Since a system that 
	has even only one part of the irreducibly complex system missing, is, by 
	Behe’s definition, dysfunctional, it could not have served as an 
	evolutionary precursor to the full irreducibly complex system. Hence, stated 
	Behe, irreducibly complex systems must have been <i>created</i> as a whole, 
	rather than evolved from precursor systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behe’s concept of irreducible complexity 
	was not really new. Long before Behe, advocates of argument from design 
	suggested similar ideas but applied them not to the molecular assemblies in 
	the cell but, say, to the eye, or to the venom-injecting system of snakes, 
	etc. When arguing that an eye could not have evolved via a Darwinian path 
	because “half an eye is of no use,” the anti-evolutionists had in fact used 
	the same reasoning as Behe did for protein systems in a cell. Moreover, even 
	the concept of irreducible complexity in its particular relation to 
	molecular systems had been suggested some ten years prior to Behe’s book 
	(Cairns-Smith 1986).</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most biologists rejected Behe’s concept. 
	The experimental evidence shows that&nbsp; irreducibly complex systems (as 
	defined by Behe) could have evolved via Darwinian path indirectly, utilizing 
	what metaphorically has been called a “scaffold” approach. This term has 
	been borrowed from the practice of building various structures, for example, 
	arches. The arch cannot stand unless its lateral halves are locked together 
	by a keystone at the arch’s apex. On the other hand, the keystone cannot 
	stay in place unless supported by the rest of the arch. So, to set the 
	keystone in its place, we first need to have the arch’s lateral halves to be 
	already in place. But to have the lateral halves standing, we first need the 
	keystone to be already in place. Does this mean an arch cannot be built 
	gradually but must rather be “created” as a whole in one fell swoop? Of 
	course, the problem of building an arch is easily solved by using supporting 
	scaffolds which are removed after all parts of the arch are in place. 
	Similarly, precursors to an IC system could have existed but could have had 
	functions different from the present functions (such examples abound in the 
	biological literature); after the “irreducibly complex” system evolved from 
	a precursor, some of the precursor’s parts (that served as “scaffolds”) 
	become unnecessary and, like a scaffold, are disassembled by the 
	evolutionary process. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his book and in several papers Behe 
	disputed critiques of his work. However, he ignored the extensive literature 
	wherein biologists provided many examples of realistic Darwinian paths which 
	could have led to the evolution of irreducibly complex systems. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Behe’s book has been subjected to 
	a strong critique from various standpoints, both biological and 
	non-biological, and was almost unanimously rejected by&nbsp; mainstream biology,

	<font face="Verdana">The next milestone in the development of intelligent 
	design theory was the publication of <i>The Design Inference</i> by William 
	A. Dembski (1998), followed in the next few years by several other books by 
	the same author. Dembski possesses several advanced degrees including a PhD 
	in mathematics. &nbsp;He brought to intelligent design theory a new level of 
	seeming sophistication. In fact, however, his numerous publications cannot 
	conceal that Dembski has neither performed any real scientific research nor 
	has made any innovative contribution to mathematics. Dembski has introduced 
	into intelligent design theory several concepts which, along with Behe’s 
	irreducible complexity, have become pillars of the theory. These concepts 
	are: (a) the explanatory filter; (b) the law of small probability and the 
	associated concept of the universal probability bound (UPB); (c) complex 
	specified Information (CSI) also referred to as specified complexity; (d) 
	&nbsp;the law of conservation of information (LCI) acclaimed by intelligent 
	design advocates as a revolutionary breakthrough on a par with Newton’s 
	discoveries; (e) the calculation of probability of a spontaneous emergence 
	of complex biological structures such as the bacterial flagellum, and some 
	others. Dembski’s ideas have not only been largely ignored by mainstream 
	science, but also repudiated by a number of experts in pertinent fields 
	(such as information theory and molecular biology). </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us briefly review the main features of 
	the listed ideas by Dembski.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dembski’s explanatory filter is a flow chart 
	which supposedly can serve as a reliable tool for discriminating between 
	necessity (regularity, law), chance, and design as the causes of an event. 
	Explanatory filter has been vigorously promoted by Dembski and praised by 
	his cohorts, however it has so far never been used to solve any specific 
	problem. As critics have pointed out, the procedure prescribed by the 
	explanatory filter is unrealistic. The artificial demarcation between three 
	distinctive causes – necessity, chance, and design -- does not reflect 
	reality because more than one cause is often instrumental in causing an 
	event. The fatal shortcoming of the EF is that it produces both false 
	negatives and false positives thus making it an unreliable tool.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dembski’s “law of small probability” 
	states: <i>specified events of low probability do not occur by chance</i>. 
	He suggests the threshold of the sufficiently small probability named the 
	universal probability bound (UPB), which is about 10<sup>-150</sup>.&nbsp; 
	Dembski obtained this number by multiplying three quantities: (1) the 
	estimated number of particles in the known universe (10<sup>80</sup>); (2) 
	the maximum number of interactions between particles (i.e. the number of 
	state changes) per second (10<sup>45</sup>); (3) the age of the known 
	universe (less than 10<sup>25 </sup>seconds). <span lang="RU">&#1040;</span>s can 
	be shown, the value of UPB suggested by Dembski is based on some poorly 
	substantiated assumptions. For example, the number of particles (10<sup>80</sup>) 
	in the universe may in fact be immensely larger if we account for the actual 
	(unknown) size of the entire universe (rather than only for the known, 
	observable part of it). </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, regardless of the value of UPB, 
	adding specification does not cure the design inference from being an 
	essentially probabilistic exercise. Analysis of CSI shows that its three 
	components (information, complexity, and specification) as Dembski renders 
	them, all represent, either directly or indirectly, the probability of an 
	event. Therefore arguments in favor of intelligent design, based on CSI, 
	essentially boil down to the <i>argument from improbability</i>. This type 
	of argument states that the universe (or biological life) is so complex that 
	its spontaneous emergence is too improbable to be considered seriously. The 
	argument from improbability has no evidentiary power and science has 
	successfully explained how extremely complex objects could have 
	spontaneously emerged without a supernatural guiding hand (as, for example, 
	in studies of self-organization, [Shanks 2004]). </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument from improbability (especially 
	in its form of a God-of-the-gaps argument) has been rejected as unreliable 
	even by some philosophers among the ID advocates (Plantinga 2001). </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dembski’s law of conservation of 
	information (2002) (which Dembski claims to have the status of a Fourth Law 
	of thermodynamics) was acclaimed by intelligent design advocates as a 
	revolutionary breakthrough in science. It was, however, shown to contradict 
	the Second Law of thermodynamics (Perakh 2004 a). It has not been accepted 
	in either information theory or in thermodynamics, but has nevertheless been 
	promoted by intelligent design advocates as an allegedly great scientific 
	achievement. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dembski’s calculations of the probability 
	of a spontaneous emergence of complex biological structures (such as a 
	bacterial flagellum) are based on a multiplication of partial probabilities 
	of imaginary sequential steps, each of them requiring coincidences of a very 
	low probability (like, for example, a coincidental gathering of numerous 
	proteins which are constituents of the emerging flagellum, all in the same 
	location at the same time). No biologist has suggested a process like that 
	imagined by Dembski, wherein the improbable coincidences are assumed to be 
	the steps of biological evolution. His approach is analogous to the example 
	of the “tornado in a junkyard” creating by chance an airplane. This scheme 
	of many coinciding improbable events has nothing to do with biological 
	science, which has developed many ideas regarding the pathways of evolution, 
	in particular for the flagellum (Musgrave 2004), wherein no assumptions of 
	such improbable coincidences need to be suggested. Dembski’s “calculations” 
	are irrelevant for biology.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise certain other parts of Dembski’s 
	conceptual conglomerate are either plainly erroneous or irrelevant. A 
	telling example is Dembski’s misuse of certain theorems of optimization 
	theory – the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorems (Wolpert and Macready 1997). As 
	one of the originators of these theorems, David Wolpert, wrote (2003), 
	“Dembski’s treatment of the No Free Lunch Theorems is written in jello.” 
	Dembski’s attempt to assert that the NFL theorems make evolution via a 
	Darwinian path impossible was based on a misinterpretation of these 
	theorems. The NFL theorems show that no search algorithm (including 
	evolutionary algorithms) is better than any other algorithm if their 
	“performance” is averaged over all possible fitness landscapes. Dembski 
	interpreted this result as a proof that evolutionary algorithms cannot 
	outperform <i>blind search</i>. Since blind search is too slow for evolution 
	to have happened during the earth’s existence, evolution must be not 
	feasible as the mechanism of appearance of the variety of species – or so 
	says Dembski. However, Dembski ignores the crucial feature of the NFL 
	theorems – they refer only to the <i>average </i>performance of various 
	algorithms. They say nothing about relative performance of various 
	algorithms on particular fitness landscapes. In fact, evolutionary 
	algorithms are known to immensely outperform blind search on relevant 
	landscapes, and therefore the NFL theorems in no way prohibit evolution.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more concept promoted by Dembski is the
	<i>displacement problem.</i> Its essence is that evolutionary algorithms 
	allegedly need to search an “information-resource space” in order to find 
	the fitness function pertinent to the particular search. The imaginary 
	“information-resource space,” according to Dembski, is usually much larger 
	than the search space (in Dembski’s parlance, “phase space”) itself, so the 
	problem becomes even more intractable, thus, again, allegedly making 
	evolution improbable. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This schema is, however, unsubstantiated. 
	(Perakh 2004b). &nbsp;In real-life problems search algorithms face a <i>given</i> 
	specific fitness landscape and therefore have no need to search some 
	“information-resource space” (the concept of which is absent in the context 
	of the NFL theorems).</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004 Dembski announced that he was 
	working on a set of papers under the overall title “Mathematical Foundation 
	of Intelligent Design.” As of December 2004, he has posted to the Internet 
	the first two installments of the planned set. In the first installment 
	Dembski claimed to have developed a new measure of information which he has 
	dubbed Variational Information. However, as was immediately pointed out by 
	experts in the matter, this article did not offer any new mathematics. In 
	fact Dembski’s allegedly novel concept of “Variational Information” was just 
	a renamed by Dembski well-known (for over forty years) quantity, usually 
	referred to as Rényi divergence of the second order. Besides, some of 
	Dembski’s derivations in that article were shown to be in error. Dembski has 
	hastily amended his article, adding a reference to Rényi.&nbsp; However, 
	Dembski’s amendments still contain erroneous points. More important, though, 
	the article in question, regardless of its quality and contrary to Dembski’s 
	announced goal, contains no notions relevant to intelligent design.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the second installment in the announced 
	set, Dembski resurrected his article about “Uniform Probability” which was 
	first published more than ten years earlier. Like the first installment, it 
	has practically no relevance to intelligent design for which it supposedly 
	provides a mathematical foundation. There is no reason to expect that the 
	entire set of promised articles will provide a foundation for intelligent 
	design, mathematical or otherwise.</font></p>

	himself has revealed, he was chosen to get a PhD degree in biology by his 
	spiritual “father,” Sun Myung Moon (the leader of the Unification church) 
	with the explicitly predetermined task “to destroy Darwinism.” Obviously 
	such an intention adopted before having studied the subject testifies to 
	Wells’s antecedent bias. Wells has published a popular book (2002) titled <i>

	industrial melanism in the peppered moths; Haeckel’s drawings of embryos of

	repudiation of Wells’s critique of peppered moths industrial melanism 
	experiments – Young and Musgrave 2005). </font></p>

	a book titled <i>Privileged Planet</i> (Gonzalez and Richards 2004). These 
	authors argue in favor of intelligent design, pointing to the alleged unique 
	properties of the Earth which, they maintain, combines highly improbable 
	“habitability” and “measurability.”&nbsp; Most of these author’s arguments are 
	based on correlations. Such an approach, as is known from mathematical 
	statistics, should be used with caution as it often leads to arbitrary 
	conclusions. This seems to be the case with Gonzalez-Richards’s assertions, 
	which at best allow for various interpretations often contradicting Gonzalez 
	and Richards’s asseverations, and at worst are simply not really true, as it 
	was pointed to by several critics. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">In March of 1999 a paper surfaced on the Internet which 
	became known as the Wedge document from the Discovery Institute. Its 
	principal author is believed to be Phillip E. Johnson. It contained a 
	detailed plan for achieving a complete overhaul of science, based on 
	intelligent design theory. The victory would be achieved in stages. &nbsp;The 
	ultimate goal of the <i>Intelligent Design revolution</i> was defined in 
	that document as “nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and its 
	cultural legacies.” </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wedge document was a five-year action 
	plan for the intelligent design movement. In fact, though, the Wedge 
	document was supposedly laying foundation for an “Intelligent Design 
	revolution” for a much longer period of time. The details of the Wedge 
	documents and the progress in the implementation of its staged strategy are 
	described by Forrest and Gross (2004). The plan envisioned activities in 
	several directions, including publication of books and papers promoting 
	intelligent design theory, public relations campaigns, organizing 
	conferences, interviews, lobbying politicians and governmental agencies, 
	working with school boards all over the country with the aim of introducing 
	the intelligent design theory into school curricula, first under the slogan 
	“teach the controversy” but ultimately as a legitimate alternative to 
	“naturalistic” science. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, after the end of the initially 
	envisioned five year period, we can state that the intelligent design 
	movement has achieved substantial success in those aspects of its actions 
	that related to public relations, recruiting politicians to their cause, and 
	gaining considerable publicity. However, the other part of the Wedge 
	strategy, envisioning intelligent design theory breaking into mainstream 
	science, has failed. Intelligent design advocates have not suggested a 
	single testable scientific hypothesis relevant to intelligent design theory 
	in any field of science. They have suggested no research program based on 
	the intelligent design theory.&nbsp; Intelligent design theory is scientifically 
	futile and its quasi-scientific mantle barely conceals its religious roots 
	and motivations. </font></p>
