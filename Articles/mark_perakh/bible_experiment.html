	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I would like to report on some 
	simple experiments I conducted in order to see for myself whose claims in 
	the ongoing war between the proponents and the adversaries of the 
	authenticity of the Bible codes conform to facts. Also, I would like to 
	offer some conclusions I have formed in regard to the question whether the 
	Bible codes are real or imaginary. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am a Professor of physics

	and University of San Diego. Among the courses I have the privilege to teach 
	is statistical physics, which I have taught for both undergraduate (physics 
	majors) and graduate students. I have published nearly 300 scientific 
	articles, several books, and was granted a number of patents. Although I 
	never did any research <i>per se</i> in the field of mathematical 
	statistics, I used quite extensively statistical methods in my work in the 
	areas of magnetic Phenomena and of electrochemistry.</font></p>

	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. <a name="INTRODUCTION">
	Introduction</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whatever views various participants 
	of the dispute adhere to, the focal point of discussions is the so called <i>
	ELS</i>, which stands for <i>Equidistant Letter Sequences</i>. This term 
	denotes any meaningful words that are formed by characters, which happen to 
	appear in the text at equal &quot;skips.&quot; For example, look at the word &quot;denotes&quot; 
	in the previous sentence. Letters d, o, and s in that word, which are 
	separated from each other by the same skip of 2 characters (e and n between 
	d and o, and t and e between o and s) form the word DOS which is an acronym 
	for Disk Operating System, and therefore it constitutes an ELS. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The dispute between pro-codes and 
	anti-codes camps is whether ELS appear in the text of the Bible just by 
	chance, or they constitute a deliberately inserted code. While all pro-code 
	people believe that the creator of the code cannot be a human being, some of 
	them (as, for example, Dr. J. Satinover) attribute the authorship of the 
	codes to God, while some others (for example, M. Drosnin) attribute it to 
	extra-terrestrial visitors to our planet. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Various participants of the dispute 
	who do not believe that the &quot;codes&quot; are deliberately inserted in the Bible, 
	approach the problem from different angles and use different sets of 
	arguments. However, they usually complement rather than contradict each 
	other. They consider each others efforts as contributing, from different 
	viewpoints, to the same goal, namely to the assertion that the &quot;codes&quot; are 
	fictitious and do not testify to the authorship by a non-human mind. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, there is no unity 
	whatsoever in the &quot;pro-codes&quot; camp. Indeed, Dr. Satinover, who, like M. 
	Drosnin, believes that &quot;codes&quot; are real, expresses in his book the opinion 
	that M. Drosnins book &quot;presents the Bible code in a most unfortunate 
	light... It has the potential to discredit the serious research...&quot; (Page 
	261 in J. Satinovers book). One of the most prolific defenders of the 
	codes authenticity, L. Eldridge relates to M. Drosnins book with the 
	utmost contempt. Dr. Eliahu Rips, to whom M. Drosnin makes numerous 
	appreciative references in his book, had disavowed Drosnins book in quite 
	resolute terms. Rabbi D. Mechanic has a high praise for the work of Rips, 
	Witztum, and Rosenberg, but dismisses with disdain the books by Y. Rambsel, 
	and by G. Jeffrey. In their turn, G. Cramer and L. Eldridge value the books 
	by Y. Rambsel and G. Jeffrey, but vigorously repudiate Rabbi Mechanics 
	articles, and so on. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Studying the publications of the 
	&quot;codes&quot; proponents makes it rather obvious that the disagreements between 
	them are due mostly to <i>different agendas</i> underlying their efforts.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this paper I shall try to clarify 
	the controversy, supporting my conclusions by observations of facts rather 
	than pursuing any agenda.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The dispute in regard to the 
	authenticity of codes essentially revolves around three topics, to wit:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. What is the statistical 
	probability that the ELS occur in the Bible by chance?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Do similar ELS occur in texts 
	other than the Bible? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. Are human beings capable, with or 
	without computers, of creating complex arrays of ELS such as found in the 
	Bible?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The people who are &quot;pro-code&quot; 
	usually answer the first question with the assertion that the probability in 
	question is extremely small. To the second question the &quot;pro-code&quot; people 
	usually answer with &quot;No.&quot; Likewise, the people who believe in the Bible code 
	usually also believe that the answer to the third question is unequivocally 
	&quot;No&quot;.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I will try to test all three answers 
	in this article. </font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. <a name="HOW COMMON ARE ELS?">
	How common are ELS?</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The numerous examples of the ELS 
	found in the Bible and demonstrated by Witztum, Rambsel, Drosnin, Satinover, 
	and others, have made a strong impression on many people. Indeed, it seems 
	hard to imagine that so many coincidences could've happened by chance. 
	Therefore, after having read the books by Jeffrey, Drosnin, and Satinover, I 
	decided, as a beginning of my exploration of the matter, to test how often 
	various ELS appear in any randomly chosen texts, in various languages.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For my first test I chose one page 
	from a letter I wrote in Russian to my friend in Moscow. That page contained 
	the total of 2025 Cyrillic characters. Using WordPerfect word processor, I 
	removed from the text in question all spaces between the words, as well as 
	all commas, periods, etc. The text thus converted into a continuous string 
	of characters. That is how it has been done in the Bible code studies. Then, 
	without using any computer program, I started looking for ELS that would 
	simply pop up from the text. I discovered in that sole page over 30 ELS, 
	with skips ranging from 15 to 60 characters. At that point I stopped looking 
	for more ELS. Most of those ELS, as it could be expected, turned out to be 
	just three letter words, but a few four-letter words jumped out of the text 
	as well. Certainly, by using a computer and extending the size of the skip 
	to larger values, many more ELS could be found in that page of my letter, 
	and much more in a larger text.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then I switched to English. I 
	conducted tests with three texts. One text (let us call it E1) was one page 
	from a letter I wrote to the USA embassy in Kazakhstan. The other (E2) was a 
	part of the first page of a story I wrote years ago in Russian. I translated 
	it into English. The third (E3) was the first page of another story of mine, 
	also first written in Russian and then translated into English. Again, I 
	stripped the texts of commas, periods, spaces, etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Text E1 contained 2107 characters. I 
	identified in that text over forty ELS, and after that I stopped searching 
	for them. While three-letter words appeared most often, there were a number 
	of 4-letter words ELS (for example rest, male, root, the name of 
	Vice-President Gore, and others.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In most of the sources dealing with 
	ELS in the Bible, a special significance is attributed to the simultaneous 
	appearance of several words related by meaning, in a proximity to each 
	other. I was curious to see, if such occurrences can pop up in the tested 
	page. At one location, the following four words appeared, three of them 
	having a common letter (T), while the fourth word (ARE) was situated across 
	the other three. Of the three words that had a common letter T, two were 
	oriented symmetrically along the sides of an isosceles triangle. The third 
	word (TEN) was aligned with the triangle's diagonal. This &quot;array&quot; of ELS 
	spelled BRIT TITS ARE TEN. The skips were 47 (for TITS), -43 (for BRIT), and 
	45 (for TEN). Of course, one may either agree or disagree with the quoted 
	sentence, but its appearance hardly could be attributed to any non-human 
	entity. (A copy of the text in question can be viewed at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/brit.cfm">brit.cfm</a>). </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Text E2 contained only 520 words. 
	Even in that small sample 34 ELS popped up at once, at first glance, after 
	which I stopped looking for them. Among those ELS three words happened to be 
	4-letter ones, the rest were three-letter words. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Text E3 contained slightly below 
	2000 characters. As in the previous examples, ELS were abundant. There were 
	some 5-letter words, a little more of 4-letter words, and a whole enchilada 
	of three-letter words. Right in the middle of the page, there was a 6-letter 
	word TORVIL. Parallel to it, in the adjacent vertical, there was word ICE 
	with the same skip of 45. Across the page, there was word DEAN, with the 
	skip of 47. Close to both Torvil and Dean the word WIN appeared twice. Of 
	course, Torvil and Dean used to be famous champions in figure ice-skating. 
	Since the story in question was written years before TORVIL and DEAN 
	demonstrated their skills on ICE, having twice WON championships, one may 
	suggest that I predicted event which would occur later, and had encoded my 
	prediction in the form of a combination of several ELS placed close to each 
	other in the text of my story. Sorry, I did not possess such abilities. 
	Among the 4-letter words were LAND, (not far from a 3-letter word SEA), 
	LULL, TILT, ODOR, etc. (A copy of the text in question can be viewed at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/torvil.cfm">torvil.cfm</a>).

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, I had written. especially 
	for this Web page, a short poem whose contents relate to the &quot;code&quot; dispute. 
	The slightly shortened version of that poem can be viewed at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Poems.cfm">Poems.cfm</a>. The 
	full length of that poem is only 558 letters. Then I stripped its text of 
	spaces, punctuation marks, etc, converting it into a continuous string of 
	letters, in a conventional way used by all ELS researchers. It took about 50 
	minutes to compose the poem. It took only about 15 minutes to locate in it 
	37 ELS, after which I stopped searching for them. I found a funny feature in 
	that text, namely three symmetrically situated appearances of the same two 
	words, as it is shown and described at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/trihen.cfm">trihen.cfm</a>.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These simple tests have shown that
	</font><i><font face="Verdana">the phenomenon of ELS is very common, and a

	be well in agreement with the multiple examples of ELS clusters found by Dr. 
	McKay in a number of non-Biblical texts, most notably in <i>Moby Dick, </i>
	as well as with many examples of similar clusters of ELS in English texts 
	demonstrated by D.E. Thomas (they both used a computer program to locate the

	<a name="ABOUT ELS REGARDING JESUS?">What about ELS regarding Jesus?</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let us take a look at the works 
	by Grant Jeffrey and Pastor Y. Rambsel and at their criticism by D. 
	Mechanic. Grant Jeffrey first refers favorably to the work done by Witztum, 
	Rips, and Rosenberg. Then he switches to the results reported by Pastor 
	Rambsel. In Mr. Jeffrey's view, the article by Witztum <i>et al </i>should 
	be accepted as a proof that numerous occurrences of the ELS in the Torah 
	indicate a non-human authorship of the Bible. Mr. Jeffrey believes that God 
	had deliberately inserted into the text certain codes in the form of those 
	ELS. In this point, there seems to be an agreement between G.Jeffrey and Y. 
	Rambsel, on the one hand, and D.Mechanic, on the other. However, soon they 
	drastically part their ways.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jeffrey, following Rambsel, insists, 
	that the Torah contains numerous references to Jesus in the form of ELS 
	which prove that Jesus was the Messiah. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabbi D. Mechanic suggests, on the 
	other hand, that there is a significant difference between the works of 
	Witztum <i>et al</i>, on the one hand, and those of Rambsel and Jeffrey, on 
	the other. According to D. Mechanic, the work of Witztum <i>et al</i> 
	represents what D. Mechanic refers to as a <i>legitimate</i> Bible code 
	research, based on scientific methods involving mathematical statistics. On 
	the other hand, says D.Mechanic, the works of Rambsel and of Jeffrey 
	represent an effort to use the legitimate results of Witztum <i>et al</i> in 
	order to validate Rambsel's unfounded, and sometimes even fraudulent claims.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Guy Cramer and Lori Eldridge, in 
	return, accused Rabbi D. Mechanic of disinformation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us look at the arguments by D. 
	Mechanic and his opponents. Rabbi D. Mechanic indicates in his article that 
	the ELS that spells the four letter Hebrew word Yeshua, which is considered 
	to be the shortened version of Yehoshua, the Hebrew name of Jesus, is 
	mathematically expected to appear in the Torah <i>by chance, </i>over 10,000 
	times. It is also expected to appear as many times in any other Hebrew text 
	of comparable size. Therefore locating this word as ELS, as it was done by 
	Rambsel, in the Torah, has no meaning. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Out of curiosity, and to see whether 
	R. Mechanic's assertion can be verified by some simple tests, I decided to 
	try to locate word Yeshua in some non-Biblical Hebrew texts. I randomly 
	pulled from a shelf a few Hebrew books. The first one happened to be a book 
	by a contemporary Israeli writer Dahn Ben-Amotz, published in Tel-Aviv in 
	1979 by Metziuth Publishers. The title of the book is <i>Ziunim Ze Lo Ha Kol</i>, 
	which translates as <i>Screwing is Not Everything</i>. (The cover of that 
	book is reproduced at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/amotzcovr.cfm">amotzcovr.cfm</a> 
	and its inside title page in English, at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/amotinsd.cfm">amotinsd.htm</a>). 
	I decided to look for occurrences of ELS that would spell the 4-letter word 
	Yeshua, as well as some combinations comprising both Yeshua and some other 
	words, such as Yeshua Shmi, Yeshua Moreh, Yeshua Khali, Yeshua Iakhol, Dam 
	Yeshua, etc. These phrases are examples of Pastor Rambsel's findings in the 
	Bible, which, in his opinion, constitute the &quot;codes&quot; proving that Jesus was 
	the Messiah. Sometimes Y.Rambsel uses instead of a four-letter form of 
	Yeshua (Yud-Shin-Vav-Ayin) a shorter, three-letter version (Yud-Shin-Ayin). 
	Likewise, I decided to look for such three-letter version occurrences as 
	well. Since I did not have the text of the book in question in my computer, 
	I could not remove from it the spaces between the words, the commas, the 
	periods, etc. Obviously, if the spaces, commas, etc, are preserved in the 
	text, and counted as meaningful characters, it makes locating ELS more 
	difficult. In such a case some of the sites in the characters strings are 
	occupied by meaningless spaces etc. So, if I could locate ELS, counting the 
	spaces etc as characters, then it would mean that indeed the ELS in question 
	are quite common. Then I would repeat the search for ELS spelling Yeshua, 
	Yeshua Shmi and the like, this time ignoring the spaces, commas, periods, 
	etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Including the spaces, commas, etc, 
	into the string, I discovered, on the very first page of the Ben-Amotz's 
	book, ELS spelling Yeshua with a skip of -68, as well as Shmi (My name), 
	right next to Yeshua, with a skip of -60 (all these skips included the 
	spaces between the words). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then I switched to a search for 
	Yeshua Shmi by counting only letters, and ignoring the spaces between the 
	words, the commas, hyphens, etc. I leafed randomly through the book, and 
	soon I located, on page 47, right in its middle, ELS spelling the words 
	Yeshua Shmi one right after the other, both with a skip of only 2. Then I 
	leafed more, randomly, through Ben Amotz's book and found the following 
	clusters (or <i>arrays</i>, if we use the term used by Satinover) of ELS.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 23, within only three lines 
	of text, words Dam (Dalet-Mem) and Yeshua (Yud-Shin-Ayin, which Rambsel and 
	Jeffrey consider a legitimate spelling for Yeshua) meaning Blood of Jesus, 
	occurred one right after the other, both with a skip of only 3.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 27, within only three lines 
	of text, the same words <i>Dam Yeshua</i>, appeared, both with the same skip 
	of 4. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 63, within only 2 lines of 
	text, word Yeshua appeared twice, once as a three-letter version 
	(Yud-Shin-Ayin) with a skip of 3, and once as a four-letter version 
	(Yud-Shin-Vav-Ayin) with a skip of -1. In the same two lines of text word 
	Moreh (Mem-Resh-Hey, meaning <i>teacher</i>) appeared 3 times with skips of 
	3, 4, and -6. In the same lines word Mori (Mem-Resh-Yud) meaning <i>My 
	teacher</i> appeared with a skip of -5. The characters of words More and 
	Mori appeared interspersed with the characters forming ELS for Yeshua.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 164, within three 
	paragraphs, ELS for Yeshua appeared 4 times, three times as a three-letter 
	version (with skips of 2, 4 and -6) and once as a four-letter version, with 
	a skip of 7. On the same page, within the same three paragraphs, the 
	four-letter word <i>Yakhol</i> (Yud-Khaf-Vav-Lamed) appeared with a skip of 
	51. The characters of the ELS for <i>Yakhol</i> were interspersed with those 
	for Yeshua. The phrase <i>Yeshua Yakhol</i> means Jesus Can or Jesus is 
	Able, and, when found by Y. Rambsel in the Bible, was interpreted by that 
	writer as one of the proofs of his claims.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A copy of the above paragraphs on 
	page 164 of Ben Amotz's book, provided here as an example, can be viewed at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/yeshyakh.cfm">yeshyakh.cfm</a>.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 315 an ELS for Yeshua (as a 
	four-letter word) appeared with a skip of -6. Overlapping that word, word <i>
	Khali</i> (Khet-Lamed-Yud) appeared with a skip of -3, letter Yud being a 
	part of both ELS for <i>Yeshua</i> and <i>Khali.</i> Word <i>Khali </i>was 
	translated by Rambsel as &quot;Polished Jewel&quot; and the phrase <i>Yeshua Khali</i>, 
	when found by Rambsel in the Bible, was interpreted by him as another proof 
	of his views on the codes and Jesus. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All the above ELS have been listed 
	by Cramer and Eldridge as those for which the &quot;significance index&quot; (see the 
	explanation below) was found to be extremely small and therefore the ELS in 
	question, in Cramer &amp; Eldridge's opinion, must have been deliberately 
	inserted codes in the Bible. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At this point I decided to try some 
	other Hebrew text. This time it happened to be a book by an English-speaking 
	writer Michael Moorcock, titled in English <i>The Stealer of Souls</i>. It 
	was translated into Hebrew and published in Tel-Aviv in 1978 by Am Oved 
	Publishers. On page 13 of that book, two clusters of ELS appeared, both 
	anchored around word Yeshua. One cluster, which all was within only three 
	lines of text, contained the four-letter version of Yeshua 
	(Yud-Shin-Vav-Ayin) with a skip of 5. Following it, ELS spelling <i>Shmi</i> 
	(My name) appeared with a skip of 7, and right after that word, another ELS 
	appeared spelling <i>Khali</i> with a skip of -18. (<i>Khali</i> was 
	translated by Rambsel as Polished Jewel). The other cluster on the same page 
	contained the three-letter version of <i>Yeshua</i> (with a skip of 5) 
	followed by an adjacent ELS for <i>Shmi</i> with a skip of 11. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At this point I pulled one more book 
	from a shelf. This one happened to be a translation into Hebrew of Ernest 
	Hemingway's <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> published in 1977 in Tel-Aviv by 
	Am Oved Publishers. On the second line of the first page of that book, the 
	three-letter word Yeshua with a skip of -4 popped out at once. Having leafed 
	randomly through the famous Hemingway's story, I saw, on page 17, the 
	four-letter version of Yeshua with a skip of -7. Of course, I looked around 
	that word to see if there are there any phrases like those touted by 
	Rambsel. I don't know why, but besides the two-letter word (Ayin-Zayin, skip 
	of -11) meaning<i> strong</i>, which probably would delight Rambsel, if 
	located in the Bible next to Yeshua, I found, next to the Yeshua sequence, 
	an ELS which had a common letter (Ayin) with Yeshua, and spelled (with a 
	skip of -11) a Hebrew word (Ayin-Kaf-Bet) meaning <i>crook</i>. I am sorry, 
	I had no intention to find an ELS with a negative connotation. My conclusion 
	though had become unambiguous, namely that </font><i><font face="Verdana">a 
	variety of ELS, including combinations of word Yeshua with various other 
	words occur quite commonly in any text, in non-biblical texts as well as in 
	the Bible. Therefore their appearance in the Bible does not constitute a 
	proof of anybody's views or beliefs. </font></p>
	</i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To locate all the listed ELS and 
	their phrasal combination, I did not use any computer program and did not 
	rearrange the text in the way it is routinely done in the Bible codes 
	studies. There is little doubt that by applying a computer program and by 
	spending more time on that effort, many more examples of ELS would be 
	located in the books I tried, those ELS seemingly related to whatever topic 
	one would choose. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There seem to be at least two 
	possible interpretations of the facts presented. One is that God (according 
	to Rambsel, Jeffrey, Cramer-Eldridge, Satinover, and others) or 
	extraterrestrial visitors (according to Drosnin) not only had dictated the 
	text of the Bible to Moses but also continues to dictate, character by 
	character, every book, and even every piece of text anybody endeavors to 
	write. The other interpretation is that all those allegedly amazing ELS in 
	the Bible have not been deliberately inserted but rather occur there by 
	chance. Of course, the burden of proof is on the shoulders of the 
	&quot;pro-codes&quot; people. Those who do not believe that codes have been 
	deliberately inserted in the Bible, do not need to prove anything as they do 
	not make any extraordinary claims. If the people choose to believe in the 
	authenticity of &quot;codes&quot; they are expected to present convincing explanation 
	as to what is the difference between the ELS found in the Bible and <i>the 
	same</i> ELS found in non-biblical texts. Given the extraordinary character 
	of the claims about the &quot;codes,&quot; the explanation in question is expected to 
	be factual, unambiguous, and not based on vague concepts such as 
	&quot;relevance,&quot; &quot;proximity,&quot; etc. </font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5.
	<a name="WAS A SUPERHUMAN MIND NECESSARY">Was a superhuman mind necessary to 
	create &quot;codes&quot;?</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The proponents of the Bible &quot;codes&quot; 
	claim that the alleged creator of the &quot;codes&quot; must have possessed superhuman 
	abilities, since neither a human mind nor the best computers available to us 
	are capable of creating such a complex web of ELS. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This statement betrays a plain 
	ignorance on the part of those who offer it. I would like to refer here to a 
	book titled &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; by David Kahn (Weidenfeld and Nicolson 
	Publishers, London, 1967). In that book one can find a plethora of 
	information about the ability of men and women to both encode and decode 
	information using methods whose complexity and sophistication make the 
	alleged Bible codes look as a children game. Even the crossword puzzles that 
	are being printed daily in local newspapers look as pinnacles of 
	sophistication as compared to the &quot;codes&quot; in the Bible reported by Rambsel, 
	Jeffrey, etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indeed, even in the book by J. 
	Satinover, who believes that the &quot;codes&quot; are real, there is an example of a 
	method of encoding/decoding which is one of the <i>simplest </i>tools that 
	had been used for encoding secret information. Nevertheless it can easily 
	produce &quot;arrays&quot; of ELS quite similar to those allegedly &quot;encoded&quot; in the 
	Bible. The method in question was apparently invented by the renown Italian 
	mathematician and writer Girolamo Cardano in 16<sup>th</sup> century. It has 
	since been used many times for encoding moderately important secret 
	messages. The method in question is as follows. A <i>grille</i>, which is a 
	sheet of a stiff paper, is used in which a set of holes has been cut forming 
	a template. Each hole has a size enabling one to write one letter through 
	it. The template is placed over a sheet of blank paper and the message to be 
	encoded is written through the holes, letter by letter. Then the grille<i>
	</i>is removed, and the blank spaces between the letters of the secret 
	message are filled with a text that has some innocent contents. The letters 
	of the encoded message thus become parts of the overall text, but now are 
	separated by &quot;skips.&quot; To decode the message, a grille identical to that used 
	for encoding is placed over the text, and the secret message is read through 
	the holes. When the holes are cut at equal distances, it constitutes the 
	&quot;simple&quot; Cardano grill. It, of course, <i>produces ELS</i> exactly like 
	those discovered in the text of the Bible. In those uncounted cases when 
	this method was successfully used, no superhuman mind was ever required.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I was a kid of about 12, in the 
	city of Odessa in Ukraine, myself and a few of my friends had fun playing a 
	game in which we sent to each other secret messages in the classroom right 
	under the nose of our teacher. To encode a message, we used several 
	techniques. One of them was the use of the Cardano grille, even though we 
	had no idea that it was invented in Italy in 16th century. I do not remember 
	now, how we came across the idea of the grille. Sometimes we used a grille 
	with equidistant holes (&quot;simple&quot; Cardano grille) thus creating sets of ELS 
	not unlike those found in the Bible. On other occasions we used a grille in 
	which the distance between the holes would either increase or decrease in a 
	regular way from letter to letter. It thus produced encoded messages where 
	the &quot;skip&quot; changed uniformly from character to character. As I will show 
	later in this paper, similar &quot;codes&quot; with regularly increasing or decreasing 
	&quot;skips&quot; can be easily located in any text as well as the ELS. I don't 
	believe any of my 12-year-old friends possessed a superhuman mind. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Especially for this paper, I decided 
	to try to encode again, like I did it as a 12 year old, some simple phrase, 
	being willing to spend on that task not more than 10 to 15 minutes.&nbsp; I did 
	not make any Cardano grille, but simply counted the letters manually. First 
	I wrote the following phrase: <i>Rabin Will Die </i>which, in the parlance 
	of cryptology, would be my <i>plaintext</i>. The choice of this particular 
	expression was due to the widely publisized alleged prediction of Rabin's 
	assassination given in the book by M. Drosnin, which will be discussed later 
	in this paper. I wrote the letters of the above expression on a piece of 
	paper, leaving spaces between letters which would enable me to insert 10 
	other letters between any two consecutive letters of the above expression.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Then I wrote between the letters of that expression a text which, even if it 
	is not very sophisticated, is nevertheless meaningful.&nbsp; The entire exercise 
	took 9 minutes. Here is the result:</font></p>
	<i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">R</font></i><font face="Verdana">ivers 
	are d<i>A</i>mningly ro<i>B</i>ust in the <i>I</i>ndian colo<i>N</i> ies, 
	moving <i>W</i>ater unerr<i>I</i>ngly, thus a<i>L</i>leviating <i>L</i>ust 
	for the <i>D</i>rinks, forc<i>I</i>ng people r<i>E</i>cognize.....</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is how the <i>ciphertext</i> 
	looks:<i>&nbsp; Rivers are damningly robust in the Indian colonies, moving water 
	unerringly, thus alleviating lust for the drinks, forcing people 
	recognize.... etc. </i></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The presence of a plaintext encoded 
	in the above two lines as an array of ELS is not evident to an uninitiated 
	reader.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the intended recipient of that message, knowing the skip 
	(10 in this case) would have no problem in decoding the message.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, if a serious need existed 
	for me to prepare a secret message using Cardano grille, doubtlessly I would 
	be able, by spendng more time, to write a much more sophisticated 
	ciphertext. The conclusion is inevitable, namely that a human mind is quite 
	capable of creating arrays of ELS not unlike those found in the Bible.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A quite impressive factual 
	confirmation of the contention that ELS clusters like those found in the 
	Bible can quite easily be produced by regular men and women, came from Mr. 
	Gidon Cohen of York, Great Britain. The story is as follows. Grant Jeffrey, 
	who authored several books about the Bible code and who maintains that the 
	&quot;codes&quot; are real, has suggested that the sheer complexity of the ELS in the 
	Bible points to its creator being God. As one of examples of supposedly <i>
	amazing </i>arrays of ELS in the Bible, Mr. Jeffrey pointed out the array 
	which contains, within a segment of the text of a relatively small length, 
	names of 25 trees &quot;encoded&quot; in the form of ELS. Mr. Jeffrey was amazed by 
	that array to such an extent that he issued, on radio, and in several 
	conferences, a challenge to anybody to compile a text, of about the same 
	size, in English, which would also contain ELS spelling the names of any 25 
	trees. Being confident that simple men or women, and even Moses himself, 
	were not capable of performing such a task, which only could be done by God, 
	Mr. Jeffrey offered to pay $1000 to anybody who would successfully fulfill 
	the above requirement. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It did not take long until Mr. Gidon 
	Cohen presented a piece of a meaningful text, in English, consisting of less 
	than 300 words (the total of 1139 characters) in which the names of <i>29</i> 
	trees had been encoded in the form of ELS. Mr. Cohen performed the task 
	without using a computer program, by manually counting characters. When a 
	computer program was used (by Dr. McKay and Mr. D. Thomas) they discovered 
	in Mr. Cohen's text additionally ELS spelling the names of at least 5 more 
	trees plus a number of ELS for various related words such as forest, copse, 
	bark etc, and plus a dozen ELS for plants other than trees. (Any reader who 
	wishes to see the text by G. Cohen, can request it <i>via</i> e-mail:
	<a href="mailto:gdc101@york.ac.uk">gdc101@york.ac.uk</a>).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To Mr. Jeffrey's credit, he admitted 
	that his challenge was met and paid the promised amount. However, it did not 
	make Mr. Jeffrey retract his statement about the alleged Bible codes. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lest I will be misunderstood, I 
	would like to point out that by refuting the claims about the necessity of a 
	superhuman mind for the creation of the alleged codes in the Bible I was not 
	at all suggesting that the ELS in the Bible had been created by men or 
	women. The explanation best compatible with the factual evidence is that 
	arrays of ELS appear in the Bible not by design but are rather chance 
	coincidences. One more argument in favor of the above explanation is the 
	fact that, after Mr. G. Cohen had compiled his short text, in which he 
	&quot;encoded&quot; deliberately the names of 29 trees, a computer analysis of his 
	text revealed there many more ELS spelling names of more trees, as well as 
	of other plants, and also 35 names of animals, as well as various names of 
	people, including that of Dr. Rips. Mr.Cohen did not place all these 
	additional ELS in the text deliberately. They appeared there by chance.</font></p>

	<a name="ABOUT THE SIMPLE STATISTICAL PROOFS">What about the &quot;simple&quot; 
	statistical proofs of the Codes' authenticity?</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I have mentioned earlier, many 
	participants of the dispute about the &quot;codes&quot; try to calculate the 
	probabilities of the appearance, by chance, of various ELS in the text of 
	the Bible. Indeed, the most highly acclaimed publication which has become 
	the pivotal point of the recent Bible code controversy, namely the paper by 
	Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg, was published in 1994 in <i>Statistical 
	Science</i> magazine. This fact underscores the role ascribed to statistics 
	for the problem in question. There are several good publications, mainly on 
	the Internet, providing criticisms of the paper by Witztum <i>et al</i>. I 
	would like to indicate, in particular, articles posted on the Web by Gil 
	Kalai, Brendan McKay, and Barry Simon. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, many of the people 
	who are interested in the Bible code controversy, either could not or would 
	not read either the paper by Witztum <i>at al</i> or the criticisms of it by 
	G. Kalai, B. McKay, and B. Simon, since much in this material is not 
	intended for laymen. On the other hand, more people read and are influenced 
	by some other publications, which pretend to treat the problem from the 
	scientific viewpoint. I believe that even if Witztum <i>at al</i> announced 
	that they were retracting their statements about the codes (I don't expect 
	this of course) many other proponents of the codes, such as Rambsel and 
	Jeffrey, would not abandon their efforts to prove the codes' reality. 
	(Recently, Guy Cramer and Lori Eldridge, who used to be among the most 
	prolific defenders of the &quot;codes&quot; have announced, commendedly,that, in view 
	of the evidence, they do not any more support the beliefs in the codes' 
	authenticity. Very courageous and honest of you, Guy, and Lori ). </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Scientists such as G. Kalai, B. 
	McKay, and B. Simon, while being involved in a discussion with Witztum, 
	Rips, and Rosenberg, evidently do not consider it worth their time to argue 
	with writers of allegedly statistical treatises that are not on the same 
	scientific level. Hence the claims of many proponents of &quot;codes&quot; other than 
	Witztum <i>et al</i> remain largely unchallenged. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, many of these claims 
	are characterized by errors and misconceptions and produce unreliable values 
	of probabilities. I believe that, for the sake of many unsuspecting readers, 
	it is desirable to explain the errors in those claims. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An example of such a faulty 
	calculation is the one which was once offered by two code proponents, whose 
	names I would like to omit because, since the publlication on the Web of 
	their calculation, they both changed their views and do not support the 
	&quot;codes&quot; any longer.&nbsp; I will refer to them as XY. It may be instructional to 
	analyze in detail those old calculations of XY as a warning example. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">XY first agreed that some of the ELS 
	found by Rambsel can indeed happen in the Bible by chance, because the 
	probability of their occurrence as they have calculated it, turned out to be 
	not very small. On the other hand, XY had singled out eleven ELS found in 
	the Bible by Rambsel, and insisted that the appearance of <i>those </i>ELS 
	by chance has such a small probability that these 11 ELS must be 
	deliberately inserted codes. To demonstrate their point, XY suggest a 
	certain procedure (they call it<i> formula</i>) for the calculation of the 
	probability of an ELS appearing in the text by chance. For certain ELS found 
	by Rambsel, that alleged probability turns out to be very small (between 
	1/99 for some ELS, and down to about 1/58,507,687 for some other ELS).
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">XY calculated for each of the 11 ELS 
	they believe to be a genuine &quot;code&quot; a quantity they call &quot;significance 
	index&quot;, which is the same as the probability of a sequence of characters to 
	appear in a text by chance. A detailed discussion of XY's caculation of 
	probabilities is given in an <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a> to this 
	article. It is shown in the Appendix that the calculation of probabilities 
	was conducted by XY in a way contradicting some basic rules of the 
	Probability Theory and therefore the values of &quot;significance index&quot; 
	calculated by those writers are meaningless numbers.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, let us consider the question: 
	what if, regardless of the values calculated by XY, the actual values of 
	probabilities in question are indeed very small? Does it mean the occurrence 
	of corresponding ELS must be attributed to a conscious design? Not at all.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Again, as an example, let us turn to 
	XY's treatment of the probabilities in question. As we shall see, XY's 
	interpretation of those probabilities is based on a misconception. It 
	invalidates their conclusions that some ELS found by Rambsel must be 
	deliberately inserted codes.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The error in question stems from 
	XY'se misinterpretation first of the meaning of probabilities in general, 
	and second of the meaning of the quantities they calculated, in particular.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us see how XY explain the 
	meaning of probability. What they say is as follows. If the calculated 
	probability of a certain ELS in a given text is, for example 0.001, then, 
	according to XY, one has to look through 1000 texts of that size to 
	encounter an ELS in question. This explanation is wrong. The actual meaning 
	of probability is as follows. If it is 0.001, it means that if a <i>very 
	large number</i> of tests has been performed (that number being much larger 
	than 1000) then the ELS in question will appear, <i>on the average, 
	approximately</i> once per every thousand tests. In order for that to 
	happen, the number of tests must be very large indeed. The more tests are 
	performed under identical conditions, the closer will be the number of 
	occurrences of ELS in question to the calculated probability (in this 
	example, one occurrence, <i>on the average, </i>per one thousand tests). If 
	the number of tests tends to increase indefinitely, the number of 
	occurrences of ELS in question will approach the calculated value of the 
	probability. However, nothing can be asserted as to what would happen in any 
	particular thousand of tests. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Theory of Probability can not and 
	does not predict whether an event will or will not occur. Even if the 
	calculated probability of an event is very small, it does not mean at all 
	that that event will not happen. All what Theory of Probability can assert 
	is that in a <i>very large number of tests</i> the average number of 
	occurrences of a specific outcome will approach the calculated value of 
	probability for this outcome along with the increase in the number of tests. 
	Not more and not less than that. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Consider an example. Nearly 100 
	times a year, a lottery is played in California. I, and you, and your 
	cousin, and every John Doe who buys a ticket, have been told more than once 
	that his/her chance to win the big prize in the California lottery is about 
	1 in eighteen million! (The precise number, as it can be easily calculated, 
	is actually 1/15,890,700). Nevertheless, millions of tickets are sold every 
	three or so days. Why? Do those results of the lottery game contradict the 
	theory of probability? Not at all, if one understands properly the meaning 
	of the quantity called probability.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The value of probability does not 
	predict how many times one must play to ensure winning. One may well win 
	having bought just one ticket (as it had happened a few times) and one as 
	well may never win even buying tickets millions times in a row. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why <i>some</i> lucky guy wins 
	almost every time the lottery is played, despite his chance to win being 
	that small? The explanation is quite simple. The chance for a <i>particular</i> 
	ticket to win is indeed 1 in about 16 million. However, the chance for <i>
	some</i> ticket out of all the tickets sold, to win, is much larger. If 
	several million tickets are sold, then the probability of <i>some </i>ticket 
	(and we never know in advance which one) to win becomes so large, as to 
	approach certainty. So, we witness about 100 times a year how an event whose 
	particular probability <i>per se</i> is only about 1/16,000,000, actually 
	happens with the utmost regularity! This fact in no way contradicts the laws 
	of probabilities. It fully conforms to the mathematical expectation for <i>
	some</i> ticket (but not known in advance which one) to win, whereas the 
	mathematical expectation for the <i>particular</i> ticket to win still is 
	very small. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How is all this applicable to the 
	ELS found in the Torah and spelling Yeshua and some combinations of Yeshua 
	with other words, such as <i>Shmi, Yakhol, or Moreh? </i>The chance to find 
	in the Torah a <i>particular</i> ELS may be small (but still much larger 
	than calculated by Cramer &amp; Eldridge) but the chance to find <i>some</i> 
	ELS, combining the word Yeshua with certain other words is much larger. The 
	reason for that is that the Hebrew language (and any other language as well) 
	contains so many different expressions and phrasal constructions, that the 
	chance to come across <i>some</i> meaningful combination of Yeshua with some 
	other words in the Torah is quite large. Indeed, when Rambsel sets out to 
	locate meaningful phrasal combination in the Torah, he is not after any <i>
	particular</i> expression. Were it the case, the probability to locate such 
	an expression could be small indeed (which still does not mean at all it 
	would not be found by chance). But since he is looking for <i>any</i> 
	combination of words which seems to support his contention that the creator 
	of the Torah encoded in it a message about Jesus being Son of God and the 
	Messiah, then the probability of coming across many such suitable phrasal 
	sets is not small at all. Like in the California lottery, where an event 
	whose individual probability is only 1/16,00,000, happens, on the average, 
	twice a week, so Rambsel's quest for suitable ELS in the Torah is expected 
	to reveal many such combination of words almost on every page. Obviously, 
	also many expressions, which contradict Rambsel's beliefs, would necessarily 
	be encountered. However, either consciously, or subconsciously, such 
	undesired phrases would be ignored, most often before their full length has 
	been revealed. This is a phenomenon that happens in every research. 
	Scientists know very well how difficult it is to accept anything 
	contradicting their expectations and how easy it is to see a confirmation of 
	a preconceived view where no such confirmation really exists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fact that many expressions found 
	by Rambsel in the Bible, were also located, and quite easily, in 
	non-Biblical texts, may serve as a confirmation that calculations of 
	probabilities, like that offered by XY, are meaningless and cannot be used 
	to justify any conclusions as to the reality of &quot;codes&quot; in the Bible. </font>

	<a name="MEANING OF THE ELS PHRASES FOUND IN THE BIBLE?">What about the 
	meaning of the ELS phrases found in the Bible?</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In view of the above considerations, 
	what is striking is how actually poor Rambsel's catch has been. While, on 
	the one hand, people like Drosnin, Satinover, Witztum, etc, have found a big 
	number of what they believe are detailed predictions of many events, such as 
	Rabin's and Sadat's assassinations, AIDS epidemics, and the like (we will 
	discuss those finding a little later), on the other hand, for such pivotal 
	event in the history as the emergence of Christianity, all what Rambsel and 
	his followers could discover in the Torah is only a number of grammatically 
	lame, ambiguous phrases. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us recall that the name of Jesus 
	of Nazareth does not appear even a single time in the open, not-coded text 
	of the Hebrew Bible. If the creator of the Bible wanted to send a message to 
	us, humans, about Jesus Christ, why would he resort to a code while avoiding 
	any direct reference to Jesus?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, the name of Jesus appears 
	overwhelmingly in the text of the New Testament, whose original, unlike the 
	Old Testament, was written in Greek rather than in Hebrew. When the New 
	Testament was translated into Hebrew, the name of Jesus was transliterated
	<i>by the translators </i>as a four-letter Hebrew word Yeshua ( in Hebrew 
	Yud-Shin-Vav-Ayin). Actually, though, Yeshua is a shortened version of the 
	five-letter Hebrew name Yehoshua (Yud-Hey-Vav-Shin-Ayin). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As the name of Jesus in the Hebrew 
	translation of the New Testament has been traditionally spelled as Yeshua, 
	Rambsel was looking for and has found in the Old Testament many occurrences 
	of the four-letter version (Yud-Shin-Vav-Ayin) and of the even shorter 
	version, the three-letter word (Yud-Shin-Ayin), but not the five-letter 
	version spelling Yehoshua. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, if one believes that the 
	ELS in question occur in the Bible just by sheer chance, then it is natural 
	that a five-letter ELS would be encountered about twenty times less often 
	than a four-letter ELS. It would be even more true for phrases containing, 
	besides ELS for Yehoshua, also such accompanying ELS as Shmi, Khali, Rimon, 
	(see below the discussion of these ELS) etc. On the other hand, if one 
	believes that the ELS are deliberately inserted codes, then unavoidable 
	question is, why Yeshua rather than Yehoshua? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While in the Hebrew language Yeshua 
	and Yehoshua are indeed two forms of the same name, there is a semantic 
	difference between the uses of the five-letter and of the shortened 
	four-letter form. Letter Hey which is present in the five-letter version but 
	is absent in the shortened one, is considered by the Bible scholars to be a 
	link to the name of God (which is in Hebrew Yud-Hey-Vav-Hey). Indeed, that 
	letter, according to the Bible, was added by God to the name of Abram, 
	converting it into Abraham, thus linking the name of the patriarch to the 
	name of God. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us imagine that in a historical 
	book about Franklin Delano Roosevelt he is consistently referred to as 
	Frankie. Of course, Frankie is a shortened form for Franklin, but obviously 
	referring to the late President as Frankie is not the same as referring to 
	him as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is even more true in the case of 
	Yehoshua's name, given the special significance of letter Hey which is 
	omitted in the four-letter version, Yeshua. The four-letter ELS for Yeshua, 
	and even more so its three-letter version, are <i>diminutive</i> forms. They 
	have in Hebrew the connotation of either familiarity, or even of a certain 
	lack of respect for the person bearing that name. Does it not look strange 
	that the alleged creator of the &quot;codes,&quot; if he wished to encode references 
	to Son of God and the Messiah, would use in those codes, so often, a 
	diminutive form of Messiah's name? Obviously, the alleged creator of &quot;codes&quot; 
	would have no difficulty to encode the full five-letter version Yehoshua as 
	many times, instead of, or at least along with its diminutive form. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, if the author of the Torah 
	wanted to encode in it a message about Jesus, would it not be expected that 
	Jesus would be at least somehow identified in the &quot;code&quot;? For example, the 
	encoded words could have spelled something like Yeshua Ha-Notzri (Jesus of 
	Nazareth), or, perhaps Yeshua ben Yoseph (Jesus son of Joseph), or maybe 
	Yeshua ben Miriam (Jesus son of Mary), or, say, Yeshua Nolad beBetlechem 
	(Jesus born in Bethlehem), or any other of numerous possible 
	identifications. Nothing of the sort has been discovered by Rambsel. So, if 
	any phrases found by Rambsel has indeed been deliberately encoded (which, of 
	course, is not proven at all), then who is Yeshua these &quot;codes&quot; refer to? 
	For example, it could very well be Yehoshua (equivalent of Yeshua) Bin Nun 
	(Joshua the son of Nun) who led the Israelis into the promised land after 
	the death of Moses. (While in English the name of Yehoshua Bin Nun is 
	transliterated as Joshua, and that of Yeshua of Nazareth as Jesus, in the 
	original Hebrew it is the same name Yehoshua or, in a diminutive form, 
	Yeshua. In some other languages both Joshua Bin-Nun and Jesus are referred 
	to by the same name, which, for example, in Russian is transliterated in 
	both cases as Yisus). At least the not coded, &quot;surface&quot; text of the Torah 
	speaks a lot about<i> that</i> Yehoshua. It could be any other Yeshua, as 
	this was not an uncommon name in Israel. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, what is the meaning of those 
	expressions Rambsel and Jeffrey attach so much significance to? For example, 
	what is really the meaning of words such as Yeshua Shmi (Jesus is my name)? 
	What can this possibly mean except of some Yeshua (and there is no 
	indication as to which Yeshua is meant) to announce that his parents named 
	him Yeshua? What hidden meaning has the expression Yeshua Rimon (Jesus 
	pomegranate)? To mean &quot;Jesus <i>is</i> a pomegranate&quot; that expression in 
	Hebrew should've been Yeshua Harimon, or Yeshua Hou Rimon. As it spells, it 
	really has no meaning by itself. Maybe some Yeshua likes pomegranates? Or 
	grows pomegranates? Or has red cheeks and is nicknamed pomegranate? 
	Obviously, the expression is ambiguous. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One more expression touted by 
	Rambsel is Yeshua Yakhol (Jesus can, or Jesus is able; or Jesus is allowed. 
	The word Yakhol means <i>will overcome</i> only in conjunction with another 
	word, a <i>noun </i>or a <i>pronoun</i>, denoting somebody or something 
	being taken over, and with prefix l' before that other word. If the word 
	following Yakhol is a <i>verb</i> preceded by prefix l', it means <i>can</i> 
	or <i>is able</i> or <i>is allowed</i>. The meaning of Yakhol standing alone 
	is ambiguous, and its exact meaning becomes clear only in context). 
	Moreover, again, which Yoshua <i>can</i>, or<i> will</i> <i>overcome</i>, or
	<i>is able</i>, etc? And <i>can</i> what? Yehoshua Bin Nun obviously <i>was 
	able</i> to perform, and did perform, according to the not-coded text of the 
	Bible, many feats. To assert that the phrase in question refers to Jesus of 
	Nazareth is an example of an arbitrary interpretation of the text, which by 
	itself has no clue as to its possible meaning. And, most telltale is the 
	fact that practically all expressions found as combinations of ELS in the 
	Bible and discussed above, have been found as well in texts other than the 
	Bible. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As mentioned earlier, some of 
	examples given by Rambsel employ imprecise translation of Hebrew words, or 
	choose out of several possible meanings the one fitting their goal. For 
	example, consider the expression <i>Yeshua Moreh.</i> The word Moreh, which 
	has several meanings in Hebrew, does not mean at all &quot;Teacher of 
	Righteousness&quot;, as they claim. The most common meaning of that word is 
	simply teacher, and it can be a school teacher of any subject, or even 
	driving instructor, tourist guide, etc. but the word Righteousness was added 
	by out of thin air. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another Rambsel's example is the 
	occurrence of the combination Yeshua Khali, which allegedely translates as
	<i>Jesus polished jewel</i>. First, if the meaning were to be Jesus <i>is a
	</i>jewel, it must be Yeshua Hakhali, or Yeshua Hou Khali. Moreover, while 
	one of the meanings of the word Khali (in Hebrew three characters Khet, 
	Lamed, Yud) is<i> embellishment</i> (any bauble, not only a polished jewel) 
	its other, quite common meaning is <i>disease</i>. So, why did Rambsel 
	choose the meaning fitting his purpose, but chose to ignore another, quite 
	common meaning, which obviously would be working against his contentions? I 
	am curious, how many more words similar to <i>disease,</i> situated close to 
	Yeshua, Mr. Rambsel did not care to report about?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the most important fact is that, 
	whatever those expressions may mean, there is no proof whatsoever that any 
	of them have been deliberately encoded rather then appear by chance. Indeed, 
	similar phrases occur in non-biblical texts as well, as I have demonstrated 
	above. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The claim that those ELS have been 
	deliberately encoded in the Torah has no more validity than the claim that 
	John Doe had won big in the California lottery not by chance but because he 
	was deliberately chosen (by God? By extra-terrestrials? By the lottery's 
	management?) Reportedly, some people who had won in the lottery believe 
	indeed that they had been personally chosen by God for a reward. Well, if 
	you believe in God who encourages gambling, then you have to believe that 
	Las Vegas and Monte-Carlo are his holiest cities, casinos are his temples, 
	and roulette tables are his altars. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In conclusion of this section, let 
	me state that I have not<i> proven</i> in this article the absence of codes 
	in the Torah, nor did I try to do so. What I did, though, was to show that 
	the alleged proofs of the validity of their views, as presented by Rambsel, 
	Jeffrey, and others, actually do not prove anything. Maybe there are codes 
	in the Torah. Maybe some of them say something about Jesus of Nazareth. 
	However, to prove that, Rambsel, Jeffrey, etc, would need to do much better 
	than they did so far. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">G. Jeffrey and Y. Rambsel have 
	recently published more books, in which they give more examples of ELS they 
	found in the Bible, supposedly confirming their previous assertions. 
	Likewise, there are additional, more recent postings on the Web, also 
	providing more examples of &quot;discoveries&quot; about Yeshua, or about some 
	&quot;predictions&quot; of future events, etc. All of it makes use of the same 
	argumentation, which I have addressed in this article. None of it adds a 
	shred of real evidence as to the authenticity of the alleged &quot;codes&quot; but 
	appeals quite strongly to the gullibility of its readers. There is no point 
	to continue addressing time and time again each of these &quot;new discoveries,&quot; 
	as this would be an open end game without a winner.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this article, I have not 
	discussed the question as to whether the ELS found by the &quot;code&quot; proponents 
	in the Bible do necessarily spell indeed what they have been claimed to 
	spell. This question is addressed in my paper at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/yeshcod.htm">Do the ELS in the 
	Bible indeed spell what they have been claimed to spell?</a> where I have 
	shown that the <i>very spelling</i> of the ELS in question, more often than 
	not, is quite ambiguous and is often interpreted in an arbitrary way.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My criticisms have nothing to do 
	with any religious beliefs, or with the question as to whether the Bible has 
	been inspired by God, or with the question whether or not Jesus of Nazareth 
	was Son of God and the Messiah. The scope of this article is much narrower. 
	It deals only with the question whether or not the arguments by Rambsel, 
	Jeffrey, etc, prove the authenticity of the alleged codes in the Bible. My 
	conclusion is that they do not. I am not claiming though that some better 
	proofs of the alleged codes' authenticity cannot be found one day. Such 
	proof, if offered, must necessarily include a convincing explanation as to 
	what is the difference between ELS found in the Bible and the same ELS found 
	in non-biblical texts. </font></p>

	<a name="AMAZING DISCOVERIES BY DROSNIN, SATINOVER, ETC">What about amazing 
	discoveries by Drosnin, Satinover, etc.? Was Rabin's assassination predicted 
	by &quot;Codes&quot; in the Bible? Was it predicted in <i>Moby Dick</i>? Was the AIDS 
	epidemic predicted?</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his book Michael Drosnin claims 
	to have made amazing discoveries in the Bible. In particular, he claims to 
	have found a prediction, encoded in the form of an array of ELS, of Yitzhak 
	Rabin's assassination. The array of ELS in question, reproduced as a tableau 
	in Drosnin's book, comprises the name of the late Israeli Prime Minister 
	(found with a very large skip of over 4000 characters) as well as the phrase
	<i>Rotzeakh SheIrtzakh</i>, meaning <i>killer who will kill</i>, the set of 
	letters denoting the year (in the Hebrew calendar) when Rabin was 
	assassinated, and also the name of the killer, Amir. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Looking at the tableau in question 
	reveals that of those words only the name Yitzhak Rabin is an ELS (with a 
	very large skip). All the rest of the words in the set are just parts of the 
	regular not-coded text, so are not codes at all. Hence, Drosnin feels free 
	to combine both ELS and parts of the Bible's &quot;open&quot; text while interpreting 
	the meaning of his finds. Since many people remained skeptical in regard to 
	Drosnin's claims, that author, in an interview, had said that if somebody 
	found a prediction of a Prime Minister's assassination in <i>Moby Dick</i>, 
	then he would admit being wrong. I assume that by saying <i>Moby Dick</i> 
	Mr. Drosnin actually meant any book other than the Bible. As to the 
	prediction of the Rabin's assassination, I assume he would allow us to look 
	for such a &quot;prediction&quot; in the form similar to what he did, as a set of ELS 
	that appear in some book <i>close to each other</i> and spell words such as 
	Rabin, murderer, and the like.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Out of curiosity, I turned again to 
	the book by Dahn Ben-Amotz, mentioned earlier in this article and titled, as 
	I said before, <i>Screwing is not Everything</i>. As mentioned before, I 
	found in that book, without using any computer program, ELS spelling Yeshua 
	Shmi etc. Now I decided to look for some ELS related to Rabin. Again, I did 
	not use any computer program, so I limited myself to relatively short skips. 
	My intention was to see if I could find relevant ELS rather easily. 
	Following Drosnin's practice, I counted only the letters, ignoring the 
	spaces between the words, commas, periods, etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A copy of the pertinent paragraphs 
	in Ben Amotz's book, described below, can be viewed at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/rabin.cfm">rabin.cfm</a>.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The word RABIN popped up on page 33, 
	in the uppermost paragraph on that page, with a skip of -35. Then I looked 
	around that word to determine if there are some other ELS related by meaning 
	to Rabin. What I found in that search was as follows. In the 2 uppermost 
	paragraphs, consisting of only about 600 characters, the following ELS 
	appeared, in a chain formation, one following the other: 1) An ELS 
	consisting of four Hebrew letters, with a skip of only -2, 
	YUD-RESH-TZADE-KHET, which reads IRTZAKH (meaning (he) will kill). 2) Three 
	Hebrew characters, with a skip of -15, RESH, HEY, MEM, which is the Hebrew 
	abbreviation for ROSH HA MEMSHALA, meaning PRIME MINISTER (this abbreviation 
	is commonly used in Hebrew, and is also used as such by Drosnin). 3) The 
	following Hebrew characters with a skip of -7, GIMEL, BET, RESH, which is 
	normally read as GEVER (meaning MAN) but is interpreted, for example, by 
	Satinover as GIBOR (meaning HERO or MIGHTY MAN). 4) As mentioned before, 
	word RABIN with a skip of -35. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, in just two short paragraphs in 
	a randomly opened page, in a randomly chosen Hebrew book, that has nothing 
	to do with the Bible, without employing any rearrangement of the text like 
	those usually performed by Drosnin, set of 4 ELS, with <i>small skips</i> 
	between the letters of each word, all words appearing in one chain, one 
	after the other, in a very close proximity, reads: (he) will kill, Prime 
	Minister, hero, Rabin. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, what about the name of the 
	killer, Amir? To relate to this question, let us consider the idea of a 
	code. Obviously, if some entity planned to encode certain information, then 
	this entity was not confined to the use of ELS. The code may be more 
	complex, and the only requirement is that the code follows certain rule. If 
	myself and my friends, as 12 year old boys, used a &quot;code&quot; in which the skips 
	either increased or decreased in a regular manner from letter to letter, why 
	could not such a &quot;code&quot; be employed anywhere else as well? So, I looked for 
	any occurrence of such a &quot;code&quot;. In the same chain of words, mentioned 
	above, I found the following 4 Hebrew letters: Ain, Mem, Yud, Resh, which 
	read AMIR, with the skip between the first and the second letter being -8, 
	between the second and the third letter being -9, and between the third and 
	the fourth letter being -10. What a nice regularity, and what a beautiful 
	code, isn't it? Now all &quot;encoded&quot; words, all within the same two paragraphs, 
	with small skips, in a chain, read <i>Amir Will Kill Prime Minister Hero 
	Rabin</i>.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Following Drosnin, one may say, What 
	an amazing discovery! Obviously, the probability of those words appearing in 
	the same one third of a page, in a chain formation, must be so small that it 
	could not happen other than by a conscious design! Hence, we must conclude 
	that in a book published in 1979 a message was deliberately encoded 
	predicting the assassination or Prime Minister, the hero, Rabin, by Amir, 
	some 16 years before it actually happened.! Such a prediction could've been 
	made only by God or by extraterrestrials who possessed an intelligence much 
	exceeding that of humans! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indeed? Regarding the probability of 
	those ELS appearing in the paragraph in questions, I can only repeat what I 
	have said earlier in this article in regard to Cramer&amp;Eldridge statements. 
	If the concept of probability is properly interpreted, as explained above, 
	there is nothing amazing in the appearance of the cited ELS in the paragraph 
	in question. Neither is it amazing in the Bible.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Mr. M. Drosnin has challenged 
	anybody to find a &quot;code&quot; predicting the assassination of Rabin in a book 
	other than the Bible, I would in return challenge him to admit that his 
	condition has been fulfilled herewith. Now he is expected to retract the 
	extraordinary claims made in his best-selling (and certainly very 
	profitable) book. Of course, he is free to verify my claim by checking the 
	book by Dahn Ben-Amotz. I hold my breath.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The unavoidable conclusion is that 
	the claims by M. Drosnin asserting that the ELS in the Bible are 
	deliberately inserted codes, many of which predict the future, have no 
	reliable proof. Most likely those ELS are just random coincidences, which 
	could be found in any text of sufficient size. If the codes in the Bible are 
	real indeed (which, of course is not impossible) Mr. Drosnin would need to 
	look for a more believable proof for his claims. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is worth to mention that M. 
	Drosnin, unlike Dr. J. Satinover (see below) has not used anywhere in his 
	examples the concept of the &quot;minimal&quot; or &quot;nearly minimal&quot; skips. Therefore 
	he hardly can resort to the argument about the skips being not minimal in 
	the Ben-Amotzs book. The skips I found there are all <i>very short</i> 
	anyway, none of them being anywhere close to sometimes very long skips in M. 
	Drosnins book. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The book by J. Satinover contains 
	some interesting pieces of history, popular explanations of certain aspects 
	of cryptology etc. Unfortunately, also in Dr. Satinover's book there are 
	examples of alleged amazing finds in the Bible. Although Dr. Satinover uses 
	an additional criterion of <i>nearly minimal skips</i>, his finds still are 
	most likely results of a random chance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is one example. In chapter ten 
	of his book Dr. Satinover presents a number of &quot;arrays&quot; of ELS found in the 
	Bible by himself as well as by Doron Witztum, by Eliahu Rips, and by Moshe 
	Katz. These arrays supposedly contain encoded information about Dr. 
	Satinovers ancestor, Rabbi Abraham nicknamed Angel, as well as about 
	Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria, about diabetes, about AIDS epidemics, and 
	about the assassination of Anwar Sadat. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I decided to look if any similar 
	&quot;arrays&quot; can be found in a text other than the Bible. For my test I chose 
	the array described by Dr. Satinover on page 164 of his book. According to 
	Dr. Satinover, it was found by D. Witztum. It deals with the AIDS epidemic.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Dr. Satinover reported, the array 
	in question<i> </i>contains ELS which spell the following words: AIDS 
	(Aleph-Yud-Dalet-Samekh), MaVeT (Mem-Vav-Tet, meaning <i>death)</i>, BeDaM 
	(Bet-Dalet-Mem, meaning &quot;in(the) blood&quot;), The HIV (Hey-Hey-Yud-Vav) etc.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Again, I leafed randomly through the 
	book by Ben-Amotz, mentioned before. I did not use any computer program and 
	did not rearrange the text like Dr. Satinover, D. Witztum, and other 
	explorers of the Bible code do routinely. My goal was to see if the &quot;arrays&quot; 
	in question could be discovered </font><i><font face="Verdana">easily.
	</font></p>
	</i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 67 of Ben-Amotzs book, I 
	found the following ELS, all situated within the two uppermost paragraphs 
	which contained the total of about 600 characters ( The paragraphs in Dahn 
	Ben-Amotz's book that contain the &quot;array&quot; of ELS related to AIDS, which is 
	described below, can be viewed at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/aids.cfm">aids.cfm</a>). </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ELS I found on page 67 are as 
	follows: BeDaM (Bet-Dalet-Mem, meaning <i>in (the) blood)</i> with the skip 
	of 15. MaVeT (Mem-Vav-Tet, meaning <i>death) </i>with the skip of 10. HIV 
	(Hey-Yud-Vav) with a skip of 18. Additionally, in the same paragraphs there 
	was word KHaLi (Khet-Lamed-Yud, meaning <i>disease</i>). Now, what about 
	word AIDS? Again, remembering the codes I used as a kid, and realizing that 
	the &quot;code&quot; must not necessarily be limited to ELS, I looked for word AIDS 
	(Aleph-Yud-Vav-Samekh) &quot;encoded&quot; with a regularly increasing or decreasing 
	skip. I found that word in the same paragraphs, the skips being 18 between 
	the first and the second letter, -17 between the second and the third one, 
	and 16 between the third and the fourth letters. How small is expected to 
	be the probability of the described occurrences?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There remains little doubt that by 
	using a computer, and rearranging the matrixes of text, every single ELS of 
	Witztums and Satinovers arrays, as well as tight clusters of ELS related 
	by meaning could be located in the Ben-Amotzs book, as well as in any text 
	of sufficient length. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">M. Drosnin is a journalist. J. 
	Satinover and D. Witztum, however, supposedly are scientists. Therefore they 
	are expected to provide a convincing explanation as to what is the 
	difference between the &quot;arrays&quot; in the Bible they have described and similar 
	occurrences in the non-biblical texts. Using the trivial argument about the 
	&quot;minimal&quot; skips would be not convincing. The skips I found in Ben-Amotzs 
	book are so small as to make the question of &quot;minimal&quot; or &quot;nearly minimal&quot; 
	skips irrelevant. As I did not use a computer, I automatically limited 
	myself to only very short skips. All arrays of ELS I found in Ben-Amotz's 
	book were situated within very short segments of text.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Furthermore, in Dr. Satinover's book 
	there are strange errors, which make one take the rest of the book with 
	caution. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is one example. On page 237 of 
	the book in question, Dr. Satinover indicated that Max Planck developed his 
	theory (which was the beginning of the quantum physics) in 1912, and that he 
	was at that time 19 years old. Not true. Max Carl Ernst Planck was born on 
	April 23, 1858. So, in 1912 he was much older than 19. Moreover, he 
	developed his theory not in 1912, but in November - December of 1900. At 
	that time he was 42. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another example. In the chapter 
	dealing with the information allegedly encoded in the Torah about Dr. 
	Satinover's ancestor nicknamed Angel, Dr. Satinover consistently refers to 
	the town where his ancestor lived, as Fostov. There is no such town in the 
	Ukraine. There is in that country though a town named Fastov. Not a very 
	serious error, but such errors hardly enhance the credibility of the rest of 
	the book in question.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">9.
	<a name="THE SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF CODES">What about the &quot;scientific&quot; proof of 
	Codes reality by Witztum, Rips and Rosenberg?</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the article by D. Witztum, E. 
	Rips, and Y. Rosenberg (WRR) its authors have reported on some results 
	which, although quite extraordinary, are often touted as products of a 
	scientific approach. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">G. Jeffrey, M. Drosnin, J. 
	Satinover, and D. Mechanic all refer to that paper with the utmost esteem. 
	As one of the arguments in favor of &quot;codes&quot; reality, these writers indicate 
	that Witztum, Rips and Rosenberg are genuine scientists, that their paper 
	was published in a prestigious refereed magazine, and that no skeptical 
	scientists could so far find any errors in WRR's calculations. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Drosnin and Satinover also bestow on 
	some people whose views they like, including WRR, the ranks of what they 
	call &quot;world-class&quot; mathematicians, probabilists etc. It reminds me of the 
	mores in the scientific community of the former USSR. Scientist had there 
	ranks like officers in the army. According to that system, a full professor 
	was meant to be automatically smarter than an associate professor 
	(&quot;docent&quot;), a Doctor of Science automatically smarter than a Candidate of 
	Science, etc. No assistant would dare to utter an opinion contradicting that 
	of a professor, etc. Now we have a funny picture of journalist Drosnin 
	awarding ranks of &quot;word-class&quot; scientists. So, now we may have a table where 
	scientists would be ranked as &quot;world-class&quot;, &quot;continent-class&quot;, 
	&quot;country-class&quot;, &quot;city-class&quot;, &quot;village-class&quot; and &quot;no-class&quot; experts, and 
	the ranking would be performed by writers of sensational books who, 
	apparently, themselves would be counted among &quot;galaxy-class&quot; judges. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I understand that the three authors 
	contributed different components to their paper. In particular, the 
	mathematical calculation was reportedly the contribution by E. Rips. Y. 
	Rosenberg developed the computer program, while D. Witztum has been 
	characterized as <i>the foremost researcher of the Bible codes per se</i>. I 
	also understand that E. Rips is an expert in Group Theory rather than in 
	Statistical science. I am not at all an expert in Group Theory so I can't 
	judge Dr. Rips' scientific achievements and credentials. I am prepared to 
	happily accept the assertion that E. Rips is a brilliant mathematician, 
	highly qualified in his field, as well as a very nice and a perfectly honest 
	person. Does it mean that we have to take uncritically everything WRR claim?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There had been many brilliant 
	scientists who goofed, sometimes in a most bizarre way. One of the most 
	outstanding Russian scientists of the last century Dmitry Mendeleev is 
	deservedly revered for one of the most important discoveries in the history 
	of science, namely the Periodic System of elements. Until the last days of 
	his life he vigorously fought against the theory of electrolytic 
	dissociation developed by Svante Arrhenius. In that, the famous Russian 
	chemist was wrong. A brilliant Russian physicist N. S. Akulov produced in 
	the late thirties a very elegant and powerful theory of magnetic behavior of 
	solids based on the concept of symmetry. Later in his life, though, Akulov 
	wrote a book on the Theory of dislocations which had become a laughingstock 
	among scientists. Professor Fleishman, a respected electrochemist, once a 
	President of the International Society of Electrochemistry, who authored a 
	considerable number of good quality research papers, in the late eighties 
	published (together with Pons) an article claiming the discovery of the 
	&quot;cold fusion&quot; which turned out to be a non-existent phenomenon. There are 
	many more such examples. Therefore an argument which makes use of a 
	scientist's reputation as a proof that his claims are correct, be it E. Rips 
	or anybody else, is irrelevant with all due respect for E. Rips scientific 
	achievements. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, if one wishes to 
	use the argument based on the credentials of WRR, then one has to account 
	for the opinion of many prominent mathematicians and experts in Mathematical 
	statistics who expressed an unequivocal rebuttal of WRR's paper (see the 
	letter of over 50 mathematicians at
	<a href="http://www.math.caltech.edu/code/petition.html">
	http://www.math.caltech.edu/code/petition.html</a>).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One more argument often offered in 
	favor of WRR paper is that so far no scientist had found errors in WRR 
	calculations. This statement is not true. There are several publications on 
	the Web in which serious doubts have been offered in regard to WRR's 
	calculational procedure. A very serious rebuttal of the entire approach by 
	WRR , from the standpoint of Mathematical Statistics and Probability Theory 
	has been proposed by a prominent expert in Mathematical Statistics, Dr. A. 
	M. Hasofer. The paper by A.M. Hasofer is available in this Web site - see
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/hasofer.cfm">A statistical 
	critique of Witztum <i>et al</i> paper</a>. Another prominent mathematician, 
	Dr. B. Simon of Caltech has also unequivocally rebutted WRR's method (see
	<a href="http://wopr.com/biblecodes/TheCase.htm">
	http://wopr.com/biblecodes/TheCase.htm</a>). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I've also read the calculations in 
	WRR's paper in question. There is one statement in the paper by WRR, at the 
	end of section A.1 of that paper, related to the
	<a name="calculation of the expected number">calculation of the expected 
	number</a> of ELS with shortest skips, that number chosen by WRR to be 10. I 
	believe that statement is in error. It had though no substantial effect on 
	the final result of WRR's calculation (see <a href="#APPENDIX 2">Appendix 2</a>, 
	added on December 6, 1998). What is more important, though, is that I found 
	in WRR's paper serious deviations from the established rules of Probability 
	Theory and Math. Statistics, which I discuss in my other article at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/witzcode.html">Some remarks in 
	regard to D. Witztum's writings concerning the &quot;code&quot; in the book of Genesis</a>. 
	Finally, as mentioned earlier in this article, over 50 experts in Math. 
	Statistics have signed a petition in which they denounce WRR's paper from 
	the standpoint of Math. Science. There is no such document in existence 
	signed by any mathematicians which would support WRR's method and 
	conclusions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another argument by Drosnin, 
	Satinover, Jeffrey, etc, is that the paper by WRR was published in a 
	prestigious scientific journal where it was subjected to a rigorous review 
	by experts.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I had been, for a number of years, 
	on the Editorial board of an international scientific journal devoted to 
	surface science. Besides, I also served as a reviewer for a number of other 
	scientific publications. I can state with confidence that the mere fact of 
	publication of a paper in even the most prestigious journal by no means 
	assures the truth of the paper's claims. While papers containing obvious 
	errors are usually rejected, in many cases an honest reviewer would not 
	consider himself/herself the ultimate judge of the credibility of the 
	paper's results. On several occasions, I, as a reviewer, recommended to 
	publish some articles despite having doubts in regard to their contents. I 
	know for fact that I was not alone with such an attitude. In 1978, an 
	anonymous reviewer of a paper I submitted to <i>Surface Science</i> 
	magazine, wrote in his (or her) review that he (or she) had doubts in regard 
	to the physical meaning of certain kinetic coefficients in my formula. 
	Nevertheless, that reviewer recommended the article for publication, 
	because, as that reviewer indicated, this was a matter for discussion 
	between the author and the readers, rather than for the reviewer's 
	discretion. (The paper was published, and initiated some discussion in which 
	my view finally won acceptance). The reasons for such an attitude are that 
	most reviewers realize, first, that they can be wrong, and second, that even 
	a paper containing errors may also contain some interesting results, some 
	provoking ideas and some stimulating challenges. Hence, the publication of 
	WRR's paper in <i>Statistical Science</i> magazine is not at all a 
	certificate of infallibility.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The paper by WRR has already met a 
	number of critical comments. Dr. Gil Kalai in his paper had pointed out 
	certain features in the paper by WRR, which seem to suggest that the three 
	authors may have used, consciously or subconsciously, certain optimization 
	procedure that led to the desirable outcome of their experiment. In some 
	other publications it has been shown that the data set used by WRR may not 
	be entirely correct, etc. Those are worthy pursuits and their outcomes may 
	serve to debunk the unfounded hypotheses in regard to the alleged &quot;code.&quot; On 
	the other hand, I believe that the questions, whether or not the data set 
	used by WRR was correct or not, or whether an optimization took place or 
	not, are not the most crucial points.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us assume that the data set 
	chosen by WRR was faultless, and that their mathematical and statistical 
	treatment was impeccable. I believe it does not matter because the paper by 
	WRR is based, in principle, on a premise, which, in my view, is 
	unsubstantiated.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">WRR have used in their article an 
	artificially constructed criterion of the authenticity of the codes in the 
	form of a quantity they named <i>proximity</i>. I believe that the final <i>
	conclusion</i> in the paper in question, stating that (I am quoting) &quot;the 
	proximity of ELS with related meaning in the Book of Genesis is not due to 
	chance&quot; is actually an <i>interpretation</i> of their result by the three 
	authors. Even if the data set used by the three authors contained no errors 
	or arbitrary choices (this has not yet been established beyond doubts and is 
	being disputed by a number of scientists) the only <i>scientific conclusion
	</i>could be that the quantity they introduced under the name of <i>
	proximity</i> reaches an <i>almost extreme value</i> when a data set chosen 
	as the &quot;correct&quot; one by WRR, as well as the actual text of Genesis, are 
	used, as compared with scrambled data sets and control texts. Anything more 
	than that would be an interpretation open for a rebuttal.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a scientific approach, the 
	factual statement of result must be clearly separated from its 
	interpretation. The authors may offer an interpretation but must not 
	substitute it for the conclusion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The justification WRR offered for 
	the use of the &quot;proximity&quot; to distinguish between the deliberately placed 
	&quot;code&quot;, and coincidental ELS, is characterized by an unfounded logical jump. 
	In the beginning of their paper, WRR discuss a situation when a <i>text</i> 
	written in an unknown language is to be analyzed. They suggest that in such 
	a text pairs of words conceptually related, for example <i>hammer </i>and <i>
	anvil, </i>are expected to tend to appear in &quot;close proximity.&quot; As far as it 
	relates to a <i>text, </i>with a meaningful contents, their hypothesis may 
	seem to be fairly plausible (even if still open to rebuttal). Then, however, 
	WRR extend their hypothesis to arrays of ELS in the Bible. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the words in a pair are 
	supposed to be connected <i>via</i> their meaning, the described hypothesis 
	by WRR is valid only for a) <i>logically organized texts</i>, and b) only <i>
	if such a text is not very short.</i> Indeed, if the text in question 
	comprises only a few tens of letters, related words such as <i>anvil </i>and
	<i>hammer</i> simply may have no opportunity, spacewise, to display their 
	tendency to appear <i>in proximity</i>. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obviously neither of the above two 
	conditions holds for ELS. All of ELS demonstrated so far do not form even 
	simple grammatically ordered sentences, not to mention paragraphs of any 
	length or any semantically ordered chunks of a continuos meaningful text. 
	Even when found in &quot;arrays&quot; and meeting the condition of &quot;minimal&quot; skips, 
	they are usually still just individual words. They appear as separate 
	one-word islands within the framework of the grammatically ordered text. 
	They are not connected to each other by any grammatical links. They are not 
	arranged in any sequences that constitute segments of a continuous 
	meaningful text. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hence there is no reason whatsoever 
	to assume that <i>if</i> ELS are products of a conscious design, <i>then</i> 
	pairs of conceptually related ELS must tend to appear in a <i>closer</i> 
	&quot;proximity&quot; than if they happen just by a random chance. Therefore, even if 
	WRR's data set and calculations are faultless, there is no clear logical 
	relationship between the extreme values of &quot;proximity&quot; and the assertion 
	that the &quot;codes&quot; have been deliberately inserted into the Genesis' text by a 
	conscious design. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By interpreting their result as they 
	did, WRR actually attempted nothing less than to <i>have read the mind</i> 
	of the alleged creator of the &quot;code.&quot; On what grounds have WRR believed that 
	the alleged creator of &quot;codes&quot; has arranged the distribution of the ELS in 
	the text in such a way as to make their &quot;proximity&quot; have an extreme value? 
	The alleged author of &quot;codes&quot; could have chosen any number of various ways 
	to make his authorship recognizable, or maybe, to the contrary, to conceal 
	it. The <i>almost extreme</i> values of the &quot;proximity&quot; found by WRR, even 
	if they are correct, may have any number of explanations not related to any 
	conscious design of the pattern in question. (see
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/witzcode.html">Some remarks in 
	regard to D. Witztum's writings concerning the &quot;code&quot; in the book of Genesis</a>).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indeed, why should the alleged 
	creator of codes have placed the ELS in close proximity to each other but 
	failed to provide any grammatical link between them? Equally plausible (or, 
	better, <i>not more implausible</i>) is the assumption that the alleged 
	creator of &quot;codes&quot; would rather create ELS with as little &quot;proximity&quot; among 
	them as possible. Indeed, as we have seen in previous sections of this 
	article, a human mind is capable of creating arrays of ELS in any text. 
	However, this task is relatively easy for a human mind only if the skips are 
	relatively short. Likewise, it is easy to manually find the ELS in the text 
	as long as one limits the search to short skips. For skips exceeding the 
	length of one page, the task becomes rather difficult. It becomes much 
	easier if using a computer. The lengths of skips contribute to the overall 
	value of &quot;proximity&quot; calculated by WRR. Hence, would it be not more 
	reasonable to guess that, if the alleged superhuman creator of codes wished 
	to make his authorship recognizable (i.e. distinctive from what could be 
	placed in the text by human writers) or if he wanted to delay the discovery 
	of codes until the computer age, he would rather opt for creating ELS with
	<i>very long skips</i>? The requirement of &quot;minimal skips,&quot; which is one of 
	the components of &quot;proximity,&quot; appears to be an arbitrary speculative choice 
	without a logical or factual foundation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There may be many ways in which the 
	state of mind of the alleged creator of &quot;codes&quot; could be surmised. None of 
	such guesses could though either be based on a factual evidence or logically 
	bridged to any well-established concept. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since there is no way to figure out 
	the way of thinking of the alleged creator of &quot;codes&quot;, there is no way to 
	reasonably choose a reliable criterion of the code's authorship. Therefore 
	even the most sophisticated mathematical calculation would not solve the 
	controversy. On the other hand, given the ease the &quot;code&quot; quite similar to 
	that in the Bible can be located also in other texts, the most likely 
	explanation of the phenomenon remains so far that the ELS happen in the 
	texts by chance rather than by design. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One feature of the alleged code is 
	that all those arrays of ELS do not reveal any information that is not 
	available without those arrays. So, what could be the possible motivation 
	for the alleged creator of &quot;codes&quot; to play such a game with the Bible text?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I can envisage an argument in favor 
	of the &quot;proximity&quot; being a valid criterion, as follows: does not the mere 
	fact that the &quot;proximity&quot; has the extreme (actually it is an <i>almost 
	extreme</i>) value for the text of the Genesis and for the &quot;correct&quot; data 
	set, as compared with control texts and scrambled data sets, prove by itself 
	that that quantity is indeed a meaningful criterion? I have a detailed 
	discussion of that question provided in my paper at
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/witzcode.html">Some remarks in 
	regard to D. Witztum's writings concerning the &quot;code&quot; in the book of Genesis</a>. 
	I may say here, that of course the &quot;proximity&quot; may be a meaningful criterion 
	of <i>something.</i> The question is what is the meaning of that criterion. 
	To that question there is so far no good answer. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have not discussed here one more, 
	quite crucial point, namely the very strange behavior of the cumulative 
	criteria of &quot;proximity&quot; suggested by WRR. I discuss this behavior in my 
	other article at <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/addrem.htm">
	Additional critical remarks in regard to D. Witztum, E. Rips, and Y. 
	Rosenberg &quot;code&quot; related publications</a>. I show in that other article that 
	the four criteria P of &quot;proximity&quot; which WRR refer to as four &quot;statistics&quot; 
	behave in an erratic and contradictory way, indicative of some profound 
	fault in WRR's approach. This haphazard behavior of the four &quot;statistics&quot; 
	alone negates the validity of their conclusion.</font></p>
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">10. <a name="CONCLUSION">Conclusion</a></font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The primitive search for single ELS 
	in the Bible, or for short phrasal constructions made up of two or three ELS 
	(Rambsel, Jeffrey, etc) as well as the more sophisticated method of forming 
	matrixes that contain arrays of ELS related by meaning (Witztum, Drosnin, 
	Satinover etc) so far have not produced anything that <i>definitely </i>
	extends beyond coincidences which happen in any text of sufficient length. 
	Neither is sufficiently convincing the alleged scientific analysis of the 
	&quot;code&quot; by WRR. Of course, if some, better-substantiated proof could be found 
	of the &quot;code&quot; being real, it would change the landscape of the field of the 
	controversy in question. So far, though, it did not seem to happen. </font>

	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">11. <a name="APPENDIX">Appendix 1</a>
	</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Discussion of &quot;simple&quot; calculations 
	of probability)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this Appendix, the &quot;simple&quot; 
	calculation of probabilty of a word to occur in a text as an ELS, employed 
	by many a code defenders,&nbsp; is being discussed. The following discussion will 
	show that such calculations ignore certain basic rules of the Probability 
	Theory and therefore produce meaningless numbers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let's say some word is a sequence of
	<i>n </i>characters x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>.....x<sub>n</sub>.<sub>.</sub> 
	What is the probability that this word appears, as an ELS, in a given text? 
	The code proponents usually calculate the probability P<sub>i </sub>of each 
	of the characters in the word in question to be found at any arbitrarily 
	chosen site in the text. They do it by dividing N<sub>i </sub>- the number 
	of times character x<sub>i</sub> is found in the entire text in question, by 
	N - the total number of all characters in that text. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This operation implicitly assumes 
	that the occurrences of the character in question are distributed uniformly 
	over the text. In other words, they calculate the <i>average</i> probability 
	of finding the character in question at any arbitrary site. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately using average 
	quantities in an improper way may often distort the results. The very 
	concept of an average quantity is ambiguous. This quantity depends on the 
	procedure chosen for its calculation. (A detailed analysis, including 
	examples, of the effect the calculation procedure may have on the average 
	values, has been given, for example, in my paper published in 1976 in <i>
	Surface Technology</i>, vol. 4, pages 538-564). In many cases, there are 
	several average quantities for the same set of random quantities, each 
	having different value and meaning. (This does not relate to the <i>mean</i> 
	value, which is unambiguously defined in the Integral Calculus and in the 
	Mathematical Statistics. The average value used by Cramer <i>et al</i> does 
	not meet the definition of that <i>mean</i> value).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us illustrate the effect of the 
	above implicit assumption. Imagine that we have a text describing tastes and 
	properties of fruits. We choose a portion of that text, of a certain length, 
	to see if there are some ELS in it. Suppose we discover that one half of the 
	selected text discusses apples, while the other half of it deals with 
	oranges. Obviously, in the first half word <i>apple </i>will be encountered 
	more often than in the second half, while word <i>orange</i> will be met 
	more often in the second half. Hence, the first half of the text will 
	contain a larger number of consonants <i>p</i> and <i>l</i> (per unit of 
	text) than the text as a whole, while the second half will contain more 
	consonants <i>r,</i> <i>n</i>, and <i>g</i> per unit of text than the text 
	as a whole. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now we want to look for an ELS which 
	spells, for example, word <i>play. </i>Obviously, we will find ELS for this 
	word more often in the first half than in the second one. On the other hand, 
	if we are looking for an ELS spelling word <i>grain </i>it will be found 
	more often in the second half of the text in question. Finally, if we are 
	looking for an ELS which spells, for example, word <i>grapple, </i>its 
	occurrences in both halves of the text will be found with about the same 
	frequency. Therefore, ELS for words <i>grain</i> and <i>play</i>, read both 
	right to left and left to right, will be found more often with such skips' 
	lengths that the corresponding ELS would cover not more than the length of a 
	half of the text in question. On the other hand, ELS for word <i>grapple,</i> 
	which require characters from both <i>apple</i> and <i>orange, </i>will 
	typically have such skips' lengths that these ELS would extend over more 
	than half of the text in question. Making a note of that fact, let us 
	postpone the discussion of its consequences for probabilities' calculation 
	until some later paragraph of this Appendix. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having calculated P<sub>i</sub> for 
	every x<sub>i</sub>, thecode proponents usually assign value of 1 to P<sub>1
	</sub>and multiply all other average probabilities P<sub>i</sub>. Thus they 
	supposedly calculate the average probability P<sub>w </sub>of the word in 
	question to appear as ELS, starting from any arbitrarily chosen site 
	containing letter x<sub>1</sub><sup> </sup>, that ELS having an arbitrarily 
	chosen particular skip. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here we encounter another, much more 
	profound fault in the calculation. The probability of a combination of 
	consecutive events is calculated as a product of individual probabilities of 
	those events. This is a common procedure in the Theory of Probability. 
	Unfortunately, such a calculation ignores a crucial point. Multiplication of 
	the &quot;initial&quot; individual probabilities is valid only if two conditions are 
	met. These conditions are as follows:</font></p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Each &quot;test&quot; must be performed 
		under the same conditions, exactly reproduced for each test. </font>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All consecutive tests must be 
		independent. This means that the results of each consecutive test must 
		not depend on the results of the previous tests. </font></li>
	</ol>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Condition 2 must be met always. 
	Condition 1 must be met if one multiplies &quot;initial' probabilities which 
	existed before any test has been performed. If, though, one <i>recalculates 
	the probabilities</i> for every test after the first one, then condition 1 
	may be waved, and the recalculated probabilities may be multiplied, as will 
	become clear from the further discussion.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we shall see, the &quot;simple&quot; 
	calculation does not meet either of the above conditions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us consider an example. Imagine 
	that there are three balls in a box, one white, one black, and one red. 
	Balls are pulled from the box in a random fashion. Obviously, each of the 
	three balls has the same chance to be pulled from the box in the first test. 
	The probability of that outcome is 1/3. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, for the second test we first 
	restore the initial conditions, namely, put the ball, that was pulled out, 
	back into the box. Then condition 1 will be met. Now, again, the probability 
	for any of the three balls to be pulled out in the second tests is again 
	1/3. The result of the second test is independent of the result of the first 
	test, so condition 2 is also met. Now the probability that after two tests
	<i>any two</i> specified balls have been pulled is indeed the product of 1/3 
	and 1/3, which is 1/9, and it is the same for all 9 possible combinations of 
	consecutive results (white+black, white+red, black+red, black+white, 
	red+white, red+black, white+white, black+black, red+red). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let us change the procedure. 
	Namely, after each test, make sure that the ball, which happened to be 
	pulled from the box in the first test, is somehow prohibited from taking 
	part in the second test. (For example, that ball can be glued to the bottom 
	of the box). It means that condition 1 is not met any longer. Under the new 
	rules, again, in the first test, when all three balls are available for 
	removal from the box, the probability for any one of the three balls to be 
	pulled out is still the same as before, that is 1/3. However, for the second 
	test, when only 2 balls out of three can be subjected to the test, the 
	probability of any of those two balls to get out is 1/2 rather than 1/3. In 
	Statistical Physics it is called &quot;to impose constraints on the system.&quot; Now 
	the probability of any combination of balls to wind up out of the box after 
	two tests is 1/3 times 1/2 that is 1/6 instead of 1/9, and is the same for 
	all 6 possible &quot;events&quot; (white+black, white+red, black+red, black+white, 
	red+white, red+black). In this case we have recalculated the individual 
	probabilities for the second test, thus making it possible to multiply these 
	recalculated probabilities even though condition 1 is not met any longer.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This example illustrates the 
	following rule: </font><i><font face="Verdana">each time condition 1 is not 
	met in the manner described, the probability of a combination of events to 
	occur <u>increases</u> as compared with the situation when condition 1 is 
	met. </font></p>
	</i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before discussing the effect of 
	condition 2, let us see if condition 1 was met in code proponents &quot;simple&quot;&nbsp; 
	calculation. Obviously it was not, nevertheless they erroneously multiplied 
	initial probabilities rather than the recalculated ones. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indeed, as soon as the first letter 
	x<sub>1</sub> of the ELS has been chosen, all the sites in the text which 
	are occupied by x<sub>1, </sub>are rendered unavailable for the next 
	character in the word. The reason for that is that as soon as the identity 
	of the first letter in the word has been chosen, this replaces some of the 
	probabilities with a certainty. Namely, we are now certain that letter #2 <i>
	can not</i> occupy N<sub>1 </sub>sites, which are occupied by letter #1. We 
	do not know which sites are occupied by letter #1, but we know how many! 
	That number of sites become inaccessible for letter # 2.&lt; Hence, the number 
	of sites in the text that are <i>accessible</i> for the second letter x<sub>2
	</sub>decreases from N to N-N<sub>1 </sub>. Consequently the <i>average</i> 
	probability of the second letter to be found becomes N<sub>2</sub>/(N-N<sub>1</sub>) 
	instead of N<sub>2</sub>/N. For the third character in the ELS in question 
	the number of accessible sites decreases again etc. (There can be a rare 
	exception when a certain character happens in a word twice in a row. In that 
	case the number of accessible sites for character x<sub>i+1</sub> decreases 
	by 1 instead of N<sub>i</sub>. Most of the time, though, it decreases by N<sub>i
	</sub>in each step whose number is [i+1]). Hence, the probabilities <i>must 
	be</i> <i>first recalculated </i>in order to multiply them. Cramer <i>et al
	</i>did not recalculate probabilities, and therefore their calculation had, 
	already on that stage, generated underestimated values of probabilities.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This effect <i>accumulates</i> <i>
	rapidly</i> with every letter added to the ELS. In the example with the 
	balls, rendering a ball, that had wound up outside the box, unavailable for 
	the consequent tests, led to the increase of the probability of a given 
	combination of balls to get out. Similarly, in the calculationwe discuss, 
	the fact isignored that choosing a specific letter of the ELS necessarily 
	imposed constraints on the number of accessible sites for every next letter. 
	This oversight resulted in an <i>underestimated</i> probability of a certain 
	ELS to be found in the Bible by chance. The longer is the ELS, the larger is 
	the underestimation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now we shall discuss the effect of 
	condition 2, which is much more profound than that of condition 1. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us consider a modified example 
	with balls. Imagine that there are six balls in a box, one white, two black, 
	and three red. The probability of any one of the balls to be pulled out in 
	the first test is 1/6 for each of them. Since, though, there are different 
	numbers of balls of each color, the probabilities of each of the three <i>
	colors</i> to show up in the first test are different, being 1/6 for white, 
	2/6 = 1/3 for black and 3/6 = 1/2 for red. (<i>Colors</i> in this example 
	are analogs of <i>various</i> <i>letters</i> in a text). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let us see what happens if <i>in 
	the first test a white ball has been pulled out</i>. As we want to model the 
	&quot;simple&quot; calculation by code proponents, where condition 1 has not been met, 
	we will discuss now a situation where that condition is not met either. It 
	means that after the first test the white ball must be rendered unavailable 
	for the second test. Then in the second test there are no more white balls. 
	There are now two black and three red balls available, the total of 5 balls. 
	Now the probability of any of the balls, either black or red, to get out in 
	the second test becomes 1/5 instead of 1/6. Since the numbers of black and 
	of red balls are 2 and 3 respectively, the probability that in the second 
	test a black ball is chosen is now 2/5, while for red balls it is now 3/5.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let us see what happens if <i>in 
	the first test a black ball was pulled out</i>. Note, again, that different 
	colors in our example are analogs of different characters in the code 
	proponents' calculation. According to the rules we agreed upon, and which 
	reflect what code proponents routinely had done in their calculation, we 
	must now make <i>both black</i> balls unavailable for the second test. Now 
	there are only four balls (one white and three red) available for the second 
	test. Then the probability of a white ball to be chosen in the second test 
	becomes 1/4 (in the previous example it was 0), while the probability of a 
	red ball to get out becomes 3/4. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hence, we see that the probability 
	of a red ball to be pulled out in the second test depends on the outcome of 
	the first test. If the first ball out was <i>white</i>, the probability of a 
	red one to be out in the second test is 3/5. If the first ball out was <i>
	black</i>, then the probability of a red one to be out in the second test 
	becomes 3/4. It is an example of <i>tests, which are not</i> <i>independent</i>: 
	outcome of every next test depends on the outcomes of the previous tests!
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now imagine a box containing 
	thousands of balls, having 22 different colors (there are 22 characters in 
	the Hebrew alphabet). It will be a model of a text for which the 
	probabilities are calculated. The picture becomes much more complex, but its 
	main features remain the same: if after each test the balls of a certain 
	color that got out, are rendered unavailable for he next test, the tests are 
	not independent, and the probabilities of various outcomes now form a 
	tangled web of multiple variations. Multiplying individual probabilities in 
	this case generates meaningless numbers as the probability of a combination 
	of outcomes is not a single valued quantity any more, but is different for 
	each possible sequence of results of the consecutive tests. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That is what happens in the code 
	proponents' calculation. Indeed, the values of N<sub>i</sub> (numbers of 
	times a given characters happens in the text) are different for each 
	character. (This is analogous to different numbers of balls of each color, 
	in the box.). Therefore, depending on the outcome of a test number <i>i, </i>
	the number of sites accessible for character number (i+1) decreases in each 
	case by <i>a different number</i> N<sub>i </sub>. Therefore the probability 
	of character number (i+1) to be encountered in the text varies depending on 
	which characters were preceding it. Hence, the code proponents multiply 
	probabilities, which are not independent! This is an elementary and quite 
	crude error. There is usually a warning against such an error in 
	introductory courses of Theory of Probabilities. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us reiterate our conclusion for 
	this part. For each character the frequency of its occurrence (the value of 
	N<sub>i </sub>) in the text is different. Hence the probability of each 
	subsequent character to be encountered in the text depends on the order in 
	which the characters follow each other in the specific word. In other words, 
	the probabilities of different characters to occur in a text, in sequences, 
	which constitute various words, are <i>not independent</i>. One of the 
	basics of the theory of probability is that multiplying probabilities, which 
	are interdependent, without first recalculating them, is meaningless. (The 
	Probability theory has certain ways to handle the situation with 
	interdependent probabilities. It is usually handled as the so called 
	&quot;conditional probabilities&quot;. Another way to cope with the problem of 
	interdependent probabilities is to use Theory of Games. However, the simple 
	multiplication of initial probabilities is a wrong way to go).</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having multiplied probabilities, 
	which are not independent, the code proponents continue their manipulation 
	of numbers, which at this stage of their calculation have already lost any 
	meaning. Their next step is multiplying P<sub>w</sub> (see its definition 
	above) by the number N<sub>1 </sub>of occurrences of character x<sub>1</sub> 
	in the text. This way they supposedly calculate the average probability P<sub>A</sub> 
	of finding the word in question in the entire text, that ELS having an 
	arbitrarily chosen particular skip. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the next step the code proponents 
	multiply P<sub>A </sub>by the number <i>z</i> of skips they wish to explore 
	(on different occasions they chose different <i>z </i>between 2 and 1000).
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let us recall our conclusion 
	that different words tend to form ELS with different lengths of skips. We 
	had established earlier in this article that some words <i>in a given text</i> 
	are more likely to form ELS with shorter skips (in our example those words 
	were <i>play</i> and <i>grain</i>) while some other are more likely to have 
	longer skips (in our example it was word <i>grapple</i>). Therefore simply 
	multiplying P<sub>A </sub>by the number of skips <i>z</i> means <i>one more 
	averaging</i>, this time again without accounting for the actual 
	distribution of ELS over skip lengths (which of course is not known). </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The last step of the &quot;simple&quot; 
	calculation is multiplying the number calculated so far, by 2, since ELS can 
	be read both from left to right and from right to left.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Once more, this operation would be 
	valid only if the text in question were a chaotic conglomerate of 
	characters. Actually it is a highly organized meaningful text. In such texts 
	the probabilities of a certain sequence of letters to happen when reading 
	from right to left is different from that when reading from left to right. 
	Here is a simple example: in any meaningful English text, if read normally, 
	from left to right, the sequence <i>the </i>will be met very often. When 
	reading from right to left, the same sequence would be quite rare. In other 
	words, by multiplying their number by 2, one more implicit <i>averaging</i> 
	is performed, again without accounting for the actual distribution of the 
	ELS, this time over the direction of reading.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus they arrive at a number which, 
	the code proponents say, is the alleged total probability to find the word 
	in question in the text in question, as ELS with skips ranging from 2 to z.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Besides the use of uncertain average 
	values, piled upon each other at least three times, and besides the most 
	egregious error of multiplying the interdependent probabilities, the above 
	calculation also ignores some other factors. For example, it ignores the <i>
	edge effect</i> (which is the limitations on the possible skip values for 
	sites that are close to both the end and the beginning of the text). It 
	ignores different frequencies of occurrences of different characters = pairs 
	or characters = triplets, etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The inevitable conclusion is that 
	the values of probabilities often suggested by the code proponents are 
	meaningless numbers. Generally speaking, they are, as a rule, grossly below 
	the actual probabilities of various ELS to appear in the text of the Bible.</font></p>

	</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">About WRR's formula for calculation 
	of the expected number of ELS</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Added on December 6, 1998)</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I have
	<a href="#calculation of the expected number">mentioned</a>, I found WRR's 
	calculation of the expected number of ELS to be flawed, but not 
	substantially affecting their final result. I did not though elaborate as 
	such an elaboration must necessarily involve certain concepts of 
	mathematical statistics not commonly familiar to laymen. I have received 
	though some e-mail messages whose senders requested an explanation what was 
	WRR's error that I had in mind. Therefore I am adding now this Appendix 2, 
	to elaborate on my assertion, with a warning that its understanding requires 
	some, at least a minimal one, background in mathematical statistics.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In their paper WRR wrote (I am 
	quoting): &quot;This expected number equals the product of the relative 
	frequencies (within Genesis) of the letters constituting <i>w </i>multiplied 
	by the total number of all equidistant letter sequences with 2&lt;=d&lt;=D.&quot;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This statement means WRR assumed the 
	numbers of letters in the tested text to be independent variables, because 
	in sufficiently long texts the relative frequencies of letters actually 
	equal the probabilities of encountering a specific letter at a site in the 
	text, and probabilities can be legitimately multiplied only if they are 
	independent. WRR's assumption would be correct only for a perfectly random 
	conglomerate of letters but it was wrong for a meaningful text and it was 
	equally wrong for any permutation of that meaningful text. &nbsp; In the 
	meaningful text and in all of its permutations the letters are not 
	independent since the stock of letters available to fill a site is limited 
	to the factual letter set of the text (in the case of Genesis this set 
	comprises 78064 letters). As soon as a specific letter <i>x</i> has been 
	used to fill a site, the stock of available letters loses that <i>x.&nbsp; </i>
	This situation meets the condition of what is called in Math. Statistics 
	&quot;test without replacement,&quot; and the pertinent distribution of letters in 
	this case is hypergeometric. WRR have implicitly used instead a multinomial 
	distribution which pertains to a case of &quot;tests with replacement.&quot; Their 
	approach was principally wrong. However, the quantitative difference between 
	the results obtained using the correct, hypergeometric distribution and 
	those obtained using the faulty, multinomial distribution, in the case in 
	point would be very small. One of the reasons for that is that the words' 
	lengths are very small as compared with the total text's length. One more 
	reason making WRR's error practically inconsequential is that their choice 
	of the number of ELS to be 10 was completely arbitrary, and therefore if 
	their faulty calculation led actually to a number different from 10 they 
	chose, for example making it 11 or 9, it would hardly matter for the further 
	treatment by WRR. I made my <a href="#calculation of the expected number">
	comment</a> in order to dispute the assertion that, first, no scientists 
	have found any errors in WRR's work, and, second, to show that an argument 
	making use of WRR's reputation is irrelevant, as neither Rips, nor Witztum 
	nor Rosenberg is an expert in mathematical statistics. (Neither am I, but 
	noticing the described faulty assumption by WRR did no require one to be a 
	real expert in math. statistics, as the error was both obvious and 
	elementary). </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the first version of this 
	article had been posted on the Internet, I received several replies. Some of 
	them supported my conclusions, while some other opposed them. Notably, the 
	negative responses came mainly from people who <i>claimed</i> to have 
	religious faith. (It does not mean that all the positive responses came only 
	from atheists or agnostics). One of those religious respondents asserted 
	that she is a believer <i>because</i> there are so many codes in the Bible 
	obviously inserted there by God. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In my view, religious people have no 
	more reason to believe that God inserted the codes into the Bible, than the 
	atheists or agnostics have, and may be even less. Indeed, anybody who, like 
	Rambsel, Jeffrey, Cramer &amp; Eldridge, etc, believes that God had deliberately 
	created the codes in question, actually believes in a very strange God. God, 
	who, as they are supposed to believe, gave Moses the commandments, who 
	created galaxies, supernovas, black holes, quarks, neutrinos, etc, who is 
	omnipresent, omnipotent, and perfect in every sense of the word, this God, 
	if we believe Rambsel's attribution of &quot;codes&quot; to him, has not even mastered 
	the grammar of Hebrew! Rambsel's and Jeffrey's &quot;God&quot; appears to be rather 
	tongue-tied, and even half-witted, as all this strange &quot;God&quot; managed to 
	produce was a number of ambiguous phrases with obscure meaning, allegedly <i>
	encoded</i> in a manner much less sophisticated than a variety of 
	human-generated ciphers and codes.</font></p>
