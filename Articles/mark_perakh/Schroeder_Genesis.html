	<a name="intro">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. Introduction</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this article I will discuss three 
	books by Gerald L. Schroeder [<a href="#genesis">1</a>,<a href="#science">2</a>,<a href="#hidden">3</a>]. 
	which have gained a substantial popularity among readers and have often been 
	acclaimed as a very successful clarification of how to reconcile the 
	biblical story with scientific data. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first book <a href="#genesis">
	[1]</a> titled <i>Big Bang and Genesis</i> is subtitled &quot;The discovery of 
	harmony between modern science and the Bible.&quot; This subtitle is a concise 
	expression of the main thrust of the book. Schroeder set out on an ambitious 
	road aimed at demonstrating to both believers and skeptics that the 
	contradictions between the biblical revelations and the claims of science 
	simply stem from incorrect interpretations and that every word of the Bible 
	is really in complete agreement with the results of scientific exploration.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder starts his book
	<a href="#genesis">[1]</a> with a rather lengthy narrative about his 
	participation in the underground tests of atomic bombs. This narrative has 
	little to do with the book's subject, but was apparently designed to 
	demonstrate to the readers that Schroeder is eminently qualified to do the 
	job. We learn that Schroeder is not some ignoramus in science blindly 
	defending the biblical stories, but, on the contrary, an experienced 
	physicist with a Ph.D. degree. Indeed, we find in his book multiple 
	respectful references to facts established by science, from archeological 
	data to Einstein's theory of relativity. Overall, Schroeder's idea is that 
	every word in the Bible is literally true and also absolutely compatible 
	with scientific data. No contradiction whatsoever exists between the 
	revelations of the Bible and the results of modern science - or so says Dr. 
	Schroeder. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Who could object to such a statement 
	if it were proven in a perfectly logical way without any distortion of known 
	facts? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Chapter 1 of his first book
	<a href="#genesis">[1]</a> Schroeder tells us that this book was a result of 
	his efforts to answer his children's questions, particularly those of his 
	son Joshua, who had studied the Bible from the age of three, and at the age 
	of eight started discovering what seemed to be contradictions between the 
	Bible and science.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder does not explicitly tell 
	us if his explanations satisfied his eight-year old son, but such a notion 
	seems to be implied. What is of interest though, is whether or not 
	Schroeder's explanation can satisfy people of a more advanced age than 
	eight. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The discussion of Schroeder's book
	<a href="#genesis">[1]</a> will include the following sections: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1) Schroeder's chronology</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2) Schroeder's estimate of 
	probabilities. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3) Some particular details and 
	examples from Schroeder's book. </font></p>
	<a name="chron">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Schroeder's chronology</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 12 of his book
	<a href="#genesis">[1]</a> Schroeder writes: &quot;..the discord between 
	archeology and theology is neither necessary nor valid.&quot; A few lines later 
	he continues: &quot;My goal in this book is to explain this compatibility to 
	expert and layperson alike.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hence, as we see, Schroeder has 
	formulated the ambitious intention of explaining to both experts and 
	laypersons, all of whom had wandered in dark until his book, the actual 
	meaning of both scientific data and biblical revelations. It is, surely, a 
	very commendable goal. An important milestone on the road to his goal is 
	Schroeder's analysis of chronological data, which until his book seemed to 
	be irreconcilably different in the Bible and in science. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder's chronological 
	exploration consists of two parts. The first part deals with the biblical 
	account of the creation of the world in six days and the second with the 
	period of time between the end of those six days and our time. Let us 
	consider each part of Schroeder's chronology in the above order.</font></p>
	<a name="six">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Creation of the world in six days<br>
	according to Schroeder</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the general thrust of 
	Schroeder's book was to prove that the biblical account and scientific data 
	do not contradict each other, one of his important tasks was to reconcile 
	the biblical story about the creation of the world in six days with 
	scientific evidence which asserts that the universe is about 15 billion 
	years old. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before his book, this contradiction 
	between the Bible and science had been discussed an uncounted number of 
	times. A notion that was often suggested was that the word &quot;day&quot; in the 
	Bible was not meant to literally denote &quot;day&quot; as we understand it, i.e. as 
	approximately 1/365 of the duration of earth's revolution around the sun. 
	What is a billion years for us humans, may be one day for God - that is how 
	that interpretation went. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Despite Schroeder's assertions to 
	the contrary, his explanation is actually in the same vein, but with one 
	difference. Schroeder turns to his background in physics, in particular to 
	Einstein's theory of relativity, in order to provide a specific 
	clarification of the six-day creation story, which, in his view, is 
	compatible with science. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Schroeder explains, the theory of 
	relativity has established, among other things, that there is no absolute 
	time. Of course, this is true. In different frames of reference, continues 
	Schroeder, the time interval between two events may be quite different. 
	This, of course, is also true. What lasted six days in one frame of 
	reference may very well last 15 billion years in some other frame of 
	reference. This is true as well. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder proceeds to give an 
	example of &quot;time dilation.&quot; This is a well known experimental result 
	regarding the behavior of mu-mesons (muons). As Schroeder tells the readers, 
	while 200 microseconds elapse in the frame of reference attached to the 
	ground, only 4.5 microseconds elapse in the frame of reference of the moving 
	muon itself. Experts would gladly agree with that statement, while 
	laypersons have to rely on Schroeder's scientific background and accept his 
	statements.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From this point on the paths of 
	experts and of laypersons necessarily will go in different directions. 
	Laypersons, impressed by Schroeder's scientific credentials, may continue 
	accepting his further explanations. The experts, however, would rather shrug 
	off the next step in Schroeder's line of thought. In that next step, 
	Schroeder makes a leap from the case of fast moving muons to the case of 
	creation of the universe in six days. According to Schroeder, before 
	creating the first man, Adam, God acted in his own frame of reference, 
	vastly different from the frame of reference which would be chosen by him at 
	the moment of Adam's creation. In the pre-Adam frame of reference - the 
	frame of the Creator - what would become billions of years on the future 
	post-Adam clock were just days. At the moment of Adam's creation, God chose 
	to switch to the post-Adam frame of reference, which then became the same 
	for God and men. What had been only six days in the pre-Adam frame of 
	reference, in the new frame of reference common for both the Creator and the 
	creation, would become billions of years. That is what Schroeder tells us.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Can we assert that the above idea is 
	false? We can't. On the other hand, can we assert, based on rational 
	considerations, that the above idea is true? Again, we can't. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder's explanation requires a 
	leap of faith. It is fine as long as it is not suggested to be an 
	explanation based on science. There is nothing scientific in the notion that 
	God's frame of reference may be vastly different from men's frame of 
	reference. As far as faith is considered, the above assertion is not a new 
	one, and is simply beyond any discussion in rational, scientific terms. 
	Schroeder, though, wants readers to believe that the described explanation 
	is somehow based on the theory of relativity. It is not. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What the special theory of 
	relativity (STR) has established is indeed that time flows at different rate 
	in different &quot;inertial frames of reference.&quot; What the STR meant by different 
	inertial frames of reference was quite rigorously defined. The rate of time 
	flow is different in two such frames of reference which mechanically move 
	relative to each other with certain constant speeds. To make a period of 
	time that is billions of years long in one frame of reference, last only six 
	days in the other frame of reference, these two frames of reference must 
	move relative to each other with an extremely high speed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, to apply this rigorously 
	defined situation to the creation of the universe according to the Bible 
	requires a considerable stretch of imagination. To satisfy the requirements 
	of the special theory of relativity, as per Schroeder's explanation, we have 
	to accept that, first, God is a physical body, second, that it is a body 
	which occupies a certain localized volume in space, and third, to imagine 
	that, during the six days of creation, the Creator was rushing at an 
	enormous speed past the universe he was creating. What would then remain 
	from the concept of the omnipresent non-material God? God performing a 
	marathon - this picture might have been satisfactory for Schroeder's 
	eight-year old son. For those over eight years of age, a better choice seems 
	to be relegating the six-days creation story back to the realm of faith.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his second book
	<a href="#science">[2]</a> as well as in
	<a href="http://www.geraldschroeder.com/age.html">some more recent postings 
	on the Internet</a>, Schroeder has modified his interpretation of the 
	biblical story by referring, instead of the special theory of relativity, to 
	Einstein's general theory of relativity (GTR). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It has been shown in the GTR that 
	gravitational fields also affect the rate of time flow. In his second book
	<a href="#science">[2]</a> and the above paper on the Internet, Schroeder 
	builds his alleged rational explanation of the six days of creation by 
	calculating in detail the duration of every of the six days in question in 
	terms of the men's calendar, using the concept of the time's dependence on 
	gravitation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The essence of the alleged 
	explanation, given by Schroeder, is as follows: At the moment of the big 
	bang, a &quot;fireball&quot; was instantly created, which was pure energy. This embryo 
	of the emerging universe did not yet contain any mass, and therefore, 
	according to Schroeder, there was no gravitation. Along with the expansion 
	of the emerging universe, energy was transforming into mass (in accordance 
	with Einstein's famous equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>). Accompanying the 
	emergence of masses, gravitational forces took hold, increasing along with 
	the appearance of the ever larger amount of mass. As the gravitational 
	forces grew, the time flow slowed down. Schroeder suggests that the decrease 
	of the rate of time flow followed a certain mathematical law. What lasted 
	just one (the first) day of creation, on the scale of our conventional 
	calendar is eight billion years. What lasted one more (the second) day of 
	creation, on the scale of our conventional calendar was four billion years, 
	etc. The total duration of creation was exactly six days as per the scale of 
	time which corresponded to the levels of gravitational forces at each step 
	of the universe's expansion, whereas on our conventional time scale it 
	lasted about 15 billion years, in full agreement with the scientific data.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is easy to see that we can 
	represent Schroeders implicit calculation by the following formula:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>T<sub>n</sub></i> = 1.6 x 10<sup>10</sup>/2<i><sup>n</sup></i>,</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">where <i>n</i> =1 for the First day 
	of creation, <i>n</i>=2 for the Second day, etc., and <i>T<sub>n</sub></i> 
	is the duration of the &quot;day&quot; of creation number <i>n</i> on our time scale, 
	expressed in the number of conventional years. Schroeder provides no reason 
	why the rate of the time flow should have gradually decreased according to 
	that rather than to any other regularity except for his desire to reconcile 
	the biblical story with scientific data. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is easy to imagine how laymen may 
	be impressed by the above explanation, which looks so elegant on its face. 
	Let us avoid discussion of some minor dubious points in Schroeder's 
	exercise, concentrating instead on the most egregious misunderstanding of 
	the matter by Schroeder, which renders his alleged explanation meaningless.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While supposedly utilizing the 
	concept of relativity of time, Schroeder actually has based his discussion 
	on the concept of an absolute time, thus contradicting the very premise of 
	his discourse. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To explain Schroeder's distortion of 
	the theory of relativity, let us first again recall certain concepts of the 
	special theory of relativity using them as an analogy. The STR had 
	established relativity of velocity. It taught us that there is no such thing 
	as absolute velocity. The concept of velocity has meaning only in terms of a 
	comparison between two (or more) frames of reference. If we considered the 
	entire universe as a single frame of reference, the concept of velocity 
	would have no meaning. Consider an even simpler example. Imagine that we are 
	in a plane, which is flying with a constant velocity relative to the ground. 
	The windows of the plane are curtained, so we cannot see the ground or 
	clouds. In such a situation there is no way to assert whether the plane is 
	moving or is stationary. From the viewpoint of physics, there is no 
	difference between the states of motion with a constant velocity and of 
	being at rest. No physical experiment performed inside that plane would 
	allow us to distinguish between the states of motion with a constant 
	velocity and remaining at rest. Therefore, within the confines of that 
	plane, the concept of its velocity has no meaning. It would acquire meaning 
	though if we had a way to relate the motion of that plane to some other body 
	(i.e. to some other frame of reference) such as, for example, the ground. If 
	we consider now the entire universe as a single frame of reference, there is 
	no meaning which can be attributed to the velocity of the universe's motion, 
	unless there is another universe, which could serve as a reference. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is some analogy between the 
	above situation and the model suggested by Schroeder. The concept of 
	different rates of time flow depending on gravitation has a meaningful 
	interpretation only in terms of at least two different bodies subjected to 
	different gravitational forces. In such two systems, clocks would tick at 
	different rates. However, to discover the difference between the mentioned 
	clocks, there must be a way to compare them to each other.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder actually considers the 
	universe as a whole, and suggests that along with the increase in the amount 
	of mass, and, hence, in the level of gravitation all over the universe, the 
	time flow is slowing down. This consideration has a number of serious flaws. 
	I will discuss here only his most egregious misinterpretation of the GTR.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>As the amount of masses 
	increased, as postulated by Schroeder, this affected all clocks in the 
	universe equally. </i>(There are differences between the clocks located in 
	various parts of the universe, which is though irrelevant to Schroeder's 
	model). The universal clock suggested by Schroeder, namely the frequency of 
	Penzias-Wilson radiation, is subjected to that effect as well as any other 
	imaginable clock. Since all the clocks are subjected to the same effect of 
	increasing gravitation, there is no way to discover the alleged deceleration 
	of time's flow. (The extrapolation of the red shift into the past can be 
	utilized to estimate the length of the universe's existence, but not to 
	discover or measure the time dilation, not any more than it could be 
	possible to lift oneself out of a pit by grabbing one's hair with one's own 
	hand and pulling it up, without any independent point of support). To reveal 
	any difference in the rate of time flow, one would need an independent 
	clock, which is not affected by the change of gravitation, and which could 
	be used as a reference. In other words, one would need a reference clock, 
	which would be nothing less than a clock showing absolute time. Such a clock 
	is not known. Since the alleged deceleration of time's flow cannot be 
	measured, or even discovered, it has no physical meaning, and has no effect 
	on any physical processes, unless an absolute time, independent of frames of 
	reference, is postulated.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, what lasted six days 15 
	billions years ago, lasts exactly six days now. If there were available some 
	other observable universe, which could be utilized as an independent frame 
	of reference, then it could be possible to find out if one day in our 
	century is different from one day 15 billion years ago. As it is, the length 
	of a day in our century is to all intents and purposes exactly the same as 
	it was 15 billion years ago. This length of the day is necessarily measured 
	in arbitrary units, and has no definable absolute (&quot;actual&quot;) magnitude.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In other words, again, the 
	difference in the rate of time flow between our time and that fifteen 
	billions years ago could be attributed some meaning only if there existed 
	absolute time. Since GTR rejects the concept of absolute time, the idea of 
	Schroeder contradicts the very essence of the theory of relativity, on which 
	he has allegedly based his model.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Conclusion: Schroeder's attempt to 
	reconcile the biblical tale about six days of creation with scientific data 
	which assert that the age of the universe is about 15 billion years, failed. 
	It was based on a misapplication of the theory of relativity. </font></p>
	<a name="first">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder's chronology between<br>
	the first six days and our time</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Schroeder tells us, at the moment 
	the first man was created, God instantly switched from his previous frame of 
	reference, in which the creation took six days, to a new frame of reference, 
	this time the same for God and men. Since then that frame of reference is 
	the one the mankind lives in. Hence, everything the Bible tells us about 
	events that occurred starting with Adam's appearance, is chronologically 
	precise. If the Bible says, for example, that Adam was 130 years old when 
	his son Seth was born, then it is precisely 130 years as we understand them, 
	i.e. the period of time it took the Earth to make 130 revolutions about the 
	sun. If the Bible says that Adam was created by God 5,750 years before the 
	publication of his book <a href="#genesis">[1]</a>, it means precisely that 
	 the time the earth circled the sun 5,750 times, counted in the same years 
	we conventionally mean. Schroeder tells us that the above number  5,750 
	years since Adam - is precisely compatible with the scientifically 
	established chronology of human history. Here is the pertinent quote from 
	Schroeder's book (page 31): &quot;In the year 1990, all the generations since 
	Adam have a cumulative age of 5,750 years. This biblical date for the dawn 
	of recorded history is closely matched by the archeological finds of the 
	last two centuries.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is a very impressive statement. 
	The average reader would be eagerly waiting for proof based on scientific 
	data. Schroeder proceeds to provide such a proof. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His argument in support of his 
	thesis is twofold. One part of his argument deals with the beginning of the 
	Bronze age and the other with the nature of those human-like creatures, who, 
	according to archeological data, lived already thousands years earlier than 
	about 6,000 years ago.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us consider both parts of 
	Schroeder's argumentation.</font></p>
	<a name="bronze">
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>a) The arguments related to the 
	beginning of the Bronze age. </i></font></p>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder juxtaposes the generations 
	of the descendants of Adam's two sons, Seth and Cain. The Bible provides the 
	ages of all the descendants of Seth, starting with Seth's son Enosh, all the 
	way to Noah, who, at the time of Flood, was 600 years old. There were nine 
	generations between Seth and Noah. Then Schroeder counts nine generations of 
	descendants of Cain, ending with Tuval-Cain. The ages of Cain's descendants 
	are not provided in the Bible, so Schroeder assumes that Tuval-Cain was a 
	contemporary of Noah and from that he concludes that the time interval 
	between Adam and Tuval-Cain was the same as between Adam and Noah, i.e. 
	according to Schroeder's calculations, some 1350 years. Subtracting 1350 
	from 5750, Schroeder concludes that Tuval-Cain lived about 4400 years ago.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above calculation is however 
	wrong, and, as we will see later (when discussing Schroeder's second book
	<a href="#science">[2]</a>) he himself was forced to change the above 
	numbers. Schroeder does not say a single word as to why he has changed the 
	described data in his second book. It is sufficient, though, to read the 
	pertinent verses (4:20 to 4:22) in the Book of Genesis to see the source of 
	Schroeder's error. While counting generations between Cain and Tuval-Cain, 
	Schroeder includes in his count Iaval (the seventh generation) and Yuval 
	(the eighth generation), although it is clearly said in those verses that 
	Yaval (also sometimes transliterated as Jabal) and Yuval (Jubal) were not 
	the grandfather and the father of Tuval-Cain, but rather his half-brothers, 
	as they all were sons of Lemach. Hence, Tuval-Cain, according to the Bible, 
	belonged to the seventh generation after Cain rather than to the ninth. This 
	shifts Tuval-Cain's lifetime back several hundred years from Schroeder's 
	assertion in his first book. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, since we are now discussing 
	the first book where Schroeder has based important and far-reaching 
	conclusions on the above numbers, let us accept those numbers for further 
	discussion, especially since in his second book Schroeder did not change his 
	conclusions based on the above dates. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As the next step, Schroeder tells us 
	that Tuval-Cain, according to the Bible, was the inventor of bronze. Hence, 
	according to Schroeder, the Bible informs us that the Bronze age started 
	about 4400 years ago. This, asserts Schroeder, is precisely what the science 
	tells us! What a proof of complete compatibility of the Bible and science!
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is it indeed? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us check precisely what the 
	Bible says about that. Schroeder refers to Genesis 4:22. Let us look at that 
	reference. Here is the literal translation into English of the text of the 
	book of Genesis, 4:22: &quot;Also Zillah gave birth to Tuval-Cain, smith of all 
	cutting tools of copper and iron...&quot;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Note that the last two words (copper 
	and iron) are, in the Hebrew text, &quot;nekhoshet ubarzel.&quot; Schroeder tells us 
	that in the early Hebrew the word &quot;nekhoshet&quot; (which he transliterated as 
	&quot;nhoshet&quot;) meant both bronze and brass. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, this can only be guessed, 
	since the literal meaning of that word is copper, whereas the Hebrew word 
	for bronze is <i>arad</i> and for brass it is <i>pliz</i>. However, the 
	words <i>arad</i> and <i>pliz</i> are absent in the text of the Torah, which 
	may indicate that these words appeared in the Hebrew vocabulary later than 
	the Torah was written. Therefore it is possible that the word <i>nekhoshet</i> 
	(Nun-Khet-Shin-Tav) was indeed used in that context to denote not just pure 
	copper but also copper-based alloys like bronze and brass. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, it is hard not to notice 
	that Schroeder, in his quest for the chronological coincidence between the 
	Biblical account and scientific data, conveniently pretends not to notice in 
	the same passage about Tuval-Cain the word &quot;barzel,&quot; which means iron. If 
	Tuval-Cain made tools not only of copper or bronze, but also of iron, then 
	we must place his lifetime at a much later date than Schroeder wants us to 
	believe. The use of iron started, roughly, some fifteen centuries after that 
	of bronze. Hence, just one word omitted by Schroeder in his reference to the 
	biblical text makes his chronological exercise ingloriously collapse. 
	Moreover, the glaring omission of that reference to iron, which obviously 
	could be only deliberate, undermines all of Schroeder's arguments, making 
	his attitude suspect of being not quite impartial. There goes all 
	Schroeder's post-Adam chronology. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we will see, in his second book, 
	where Schroeder changes the dates (without any explanation for the reason) 
	the described discrepancy is only exacerbated. </font></p>
	<a name="arch">
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>b) The arguments related to 
	archeological data about times earlier than 5760 years ago</i></font></p>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having successfully, in his view, 
	dealt with the beginning of the Bronze age, Schroeder faced another 
	controversy between science and the Bible. According to the Bible, the first 
	man, Adam, was created less than 6,000 years ago. On the other hand, 
	archeological data indicate that creatures possessing many characteristics 
	of humans lived at much earlier time. To reconcile these two viewpoints 
	Schroeder advances some rather clever explanations. According to his 
	suggestion, the human-like creatures that lived before Adam were not really 
	human. They were, Schroeder tells us, animals which had some characteristics 
	in common with post-Adam humans, but did not possess a human soul (in Hebrew 
	- <i>neshamah</i>). Adam, according to that explanation. was the first real 
	man, the first to receive from God his <i>neshamah</i>, whereas pre-Adam 
	humanlike animals did not have one. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before discussing in detail 
	Schroeder's notion about Adam being the first real human possessing the &quot;<i>neshamah</i>&quot; 
	let us make note of the following historical evidence. If we believe 
	Schroeder, at a certain moment in the history of men, namely less than 6,000 
	years ego, a revolutionary event occurred which radically changed the nature 
	of the humanlike animals converting them into real humans, who were given 
	the &quot;neshama,&quot; thus separating them in a crucial manner from all other 
	animals. There is, though, historic evidence that, for example in the 
	country of Egypt, a well organized state existed earlier than 6,000 years 
	ago. There is plenty of information about that state. If at a certain 
	moment, about 6,000 years ago, a revolutionary change in the nature of men 
	took place, wouldn't we expect that such an event would be somehow reflected 
	in the records pertaining to that time? There is no evidence whatsoever in 
	the scientifically established history of Egypt which would indicate any 
	radical change in the nature of men at the above mentioned time. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To further discuss Schroeder's 
	clever explanation we have to define what distinguishes a man from an 
	animal. In that endeavor I will not argue against Schroeder's contention 
	that pre-Adam humanlike creatures did not possess a <i>neshamah,</i> because 
	this notion cannot be either proven or rejected based on any rationally 
	acceptable evidence. It is a matter of faith, and in this article I do not 
	argue either in favor or against faith. We can, though, try to establish 
	some verifiable criteria which would enable us to distinguish between 
	animals and men. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems reasonable to assume that 
	the following features are usual characteristics of humans while absent in 
	animals:</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Humans possess language, necessarily 
	spoken and more often than not also written. Each human language has a well 
	defined grammatical structure. No animals have a <i>real</i> language 
	(unless the word language is applied to the primitive systems of sounds used 
	by some animals, like dolphins or chimpanzees, which lack any grammatical 
	structure and have an extremely limited &quot;vocabulary&quot;). Of course, no animal 
	uses a written language. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Humans often form societies 
	comprising thousands of members, structured vertically with many layers of 
	hierarchy. The closest form of a hierarchy in the animal world is that in a 
	family, say, of wolves, apes, or lions. The human society often forms a 
	government and a law system. There is no equivalent to a government in the 
	animal world (where the formations closest to a society are cattle herds and 
	wolf packs). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Humans usually develop technologies 
	aimed at improving their standard of living. These technologies involve 
	building living quarters, making tools for acquiring food and clothing, etc. 
	Humans possess an obvious capacity to improve the design of their creations 
	and to invent new forms of technology. Some animals also build living 
	quarters or even construct dams (beavers) and the like, but they never 
	change the scheme of those constructions and have no evident capacity to 
	improve and to invent. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Humans typically develop arts, 
	including music, dance, and art of images (like painting). No animals are 
	known to have any form of art. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, humans often develop some 
	form of religion, whereas no animals are known to have any religious 
	concepts or any notion of a deity (unless you believe your dog considers you 
	to be God). I assume the development of religion can very decisively 
	distinguish real man from any other humanlike or non-humanlike creature.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If we account for the above points, 
	then, according to Schroeder's concept, the humanlike predecessors of Adam 
	who had not really been humans, but just humanlike animals, did not have a 
	written language, did not have a law system, did not have any government, 
	did not have any art and did not have any religion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Archeological data strongly 
	contradict the above points. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this article I do not try to 
	prove either the biblical or the scientific viewpoint, leaving it to each 
	reader to decide for him/herself whether to accept the biblical or the 
	scientific side of the story. My goal in this article is only to test 
	Schroeder's arguments in regard to the absence of contradiction between the 
	above two views. Since Schroeder accepts equally both world outlooks, we 
	have no need to judge the merits of either of the two views, but only to see 
	if these two views can be logically reconciled. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is the Bible's story? It says 
	that the first man walked on the earth roughly 6,000 years ago. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is the scientific story? It is 
	rather different. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Archeological data indicate that 
	humanlike creatures made tools of stone as early as about 40,000 years ago. 
	Is any animal known to shape stones into tools? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The color pictures of animals had 
	been drawn on rocks as early as about 27,000 years ago (for example, the 
	image of a horse in Pech Merle, France). What animal is known to engage in 
	art? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As archeological data indicate, as 
	early as 23,000 years ago humanlike creatures used to embellish their looks 
	by means of beads attached to their clothing. Is there any animal known to 
	use artificially made clothing and, moreover, to embellish them in any way?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Archeological data indicate that as 
	early as 18,000 years ago humanlike creatures used needles made of bones to 
	sew clothing. Is there any animal known to sew clothing? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Archeological data indicate that the 
	bow and arrow was already in use about 11,000 years ago. Is there any animal 
	capable of inventing and using sophisticated tools such as the bow and 
	arrow? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Archeological data indicate that as 
	early as about 9,000 years ago humanlike creatures already used pottery. To 
	make the pottery, those humanlike creatures used kilns where the temperature 
	reached about 1000 degrees. Is there any animal capable of constructing 
	kilns and, moreover, of making and utilizing pottery? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At about the same time, some 9,000 
	years ago, the humanlike creatures built settlements occupying over two 
	hectares each, where buildings were used as living quarters and as storage 
	sheds. About 8,000 years ago, the size of such settlements was sometimes up 
	to 15 hectares. The inhabitants of those settlements used artificial 
	irrigation and grew crops. They used seals, which proves the existence of 
	some form of a writing system and of some form of documentation. Are there 
	any animals known for building villages, using artificial irrigation, 
	growing crops, and using a writing system and a documentation? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, one more thing archeology 
	tells us about is as follows: As early as about 8,000 years ago, that is 
	some 2,000 years before the date, when, according to the Bible, the first 
	man, Adam, appeared, humanlike creatures (as, for example, inhabitants of 
	the Sumerian settlement at Tepe Gawra in Mesopotamia) systematically built, 
	in the centers of their villages, religious shrines and temples. Is there an 
	animal, however intelligent, that is known to have any religious concepts?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What we can say with a reasonable 
	confidence, is that the arguments by Schroeder aimed at proving the 
	compatibility of the biblical and the scientific accounts, fall apart at 
	even a perfunctory glance.</font></p>
	<a name="estimates">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. Schroeder estimates 
	probabilities</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the chapters dealing with 
	probabilities, Schroeder's attitude is different from that in the chapters 
	dealing with chronology. In the latter, Schroeder fully accepted scientific 
	data and tried to reconcile them with the biblical story. That attitude was 
	due to Schroeder's opinion that the archeological data are so firmly 
	established that refuting them would be surely a losing proposition. Hence, 
	to salvage his belief in the biblical story Schroeder had no other resort 
	but to look for a way to reconcile the biblical and the archeological 
	stories. As the previous sections of this paper have demonstrated, Schroeder 
	failed in his attempt. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the chapters dealing with 
	probabilistic estimates in regard to the origin of life, Schroeder felt more 
	comfortable in adhering to the biblical story because the origin of life, as 
	suggested in science, has not been proven scientifically to the same 
	irrefutable extent as the archeological data. Therefore, when dealing with 
	the origin of life, Schroeder seems to be confident in his ability to refute 
	the scientific hypothesis in favor of the biblical story. There are no more 
	attempts to reconcile the scientific and the biblical views, but rather an 
	unequivocal rejection of the scientific hypothesis, and an equally 
	unequivocal acceptance of the biblical story. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The scientific hypothesis is based 
	on the assumption that life emerged spontaneously as a result of chance 
	interactions between chemicals in the primeval atmosphere of the Earth 
	several billions years ago. Another version of that hypothesis suggests that 
	life could have been brought to the Earth from some other worlds, where it 
	originated spontaneously <i>via</i> the above mentioned, largely stochastic 
	process. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder has based his refutation 
	of the above hypothesis on certain probabilistic considerations. For 
	example, on page 111 of his book <a href="#genesis">[1]</a> he wrote about 
	the scientists who adhere to the above scientific hypothesis: &quot;These 
	scientists were making assumptions without any attempt to rigorously 
	investigate the probability of such events.&quot; Obviously, what Schroeder wants 
	us to believe is that unlike those less-than-rigorous scientists, he has 
	rigorously investigated the probability of a spontaneous emergence of life
	<i>via</i> chance occurrence of chemical interactions. The conclusion 
	Schroeder extracted from his rigorous investigation was that spontaneous 
	emergence of life was impossible because the time needed for such an event 
	to occur is so immense as to exceed the entire duration of the existence of 
	the universe. This conclusion is far from being new and has been advanced an 
	uncounted number of times by the defenders of the biblical story. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above consideration in turn is 
	based on a certain interpretation of the concept of probability, which 
	Schroeder shares and tries to explain. The essence of the interpretation in 
	question can be best illustrated by quoting again from Schroeder's book 
	(page 113): &quot;The probability of duplicating, by chance, two identical 
	protein chains, each with 100 amino-acids, is 1 chance in 20<sup>100</sup>, 
	which equals the digit 1 followed by 130 zeroes...&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While the arithmetic in the quoted 
	segment is not exactly correct (the actual expression contains many digits 
	other than zeroes), in principle Schroeder's statement is correct in that 
	the probability in question is indeed an extremely small number. However, as 
	Schroeder continues, his further reasoning becomes contrary to the correct 
	concept of probability. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is what follows on page 113: 
	&quot;To reach the probable condition that a single protein might have developed 
	by chance, we would need 10<sup>110</sup> trials to have been completed each 
	second since the start of the time. To carry out these concurrent trials, 
	the feed stock of the reactions would require 10<sup>90</sup> grams of 
	carbon. But the entire mass of the Earth (all elements combined) is only 
	6x10<sup>27</sup> grams!&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What a triumph for the opponents of 
	the hypothesis of the spontaneous emergence of life! What a nice 
	calculation! What an impressive statement so categorically demolishing the 
	hypothesis of the spontaneous emergence of life! If only these statements 
	and arguments were correct beyond the sheer arithmetic! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In reality, the above argumentation 
	is wrong. It misinterprets the meaning of probability. If that argumentation 
	were correct, then we would have to accept that to win big in a California 
	lottery, where the chance of winning the jackpot is about 1 in 16,000,000, 
	one necessarily needs to play the lottery 16,000,000 times. We know, though, 
	that some people have won big, having bought just one ticket the first time 
	in their life. Such a smile by the Lady luck happened more than once, 
	defying the 16 million-to-one odds. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The concept of probability and its 
	application is discussed in detail in my article
	<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/probabilities.cfm">Improbable 
	Probabilities</a>. That discussion demonstrates the lack of substantiation 
	in Schroeder's position. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The value of probability does not 
	provide any information in regard to what will occur in any individual 
	trial. If the probability of an event is one out of trillion of trillions, 
	there is nothing surprising if that event actually occurs in a particular 
	trial, since its appearance is as likely as of any other equally probable 
	event. From this standpoint, the arguments by Schroeder based on the very 
	small calculated probability of life emerging as a result of random chemical 
	reactions are meaningless, since a small calculated probability in no way 
	means the impossibility of an event. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Moreover, there are many situations 
	where the possible event are not equally probable. As it is shown in my 
	article on probabilities, referred to above, the calculated probability in a 
	certain sense reflects the level of information available about the object 
	whose behavior is being guessed, rather than the objective likelihood of the 
	event in question. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In regard to the random chemical 
	reactions in the primordial atmosphere, the assumption of equiprobability 
	has no foundation. Some chemical interactions must have been much more 
	likely than some others. Certain conditions in the primordial atmosphere 
	could have been conducive to certain interactions while inhibiting some 
	other interactions. Under certain conditions, powerful catalytic effects 
	could have emerged, greatly enhancing the likelihood of interactions which 
	would become steps toward the emergence of life. Schroeder's calculations of 
	probabilities completely ignore such alternatives and are therefore nowhere 
	near a reasonable proof. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Furthermore, the theories of the 
	life emergence do not suggest that it was a single act wherein all the 
	components of the living matter came together at once by sheer chance. On 
	the contrary, the scientific theories suggest that life emerged as a result 
	of many small steps each requiring a chance combination of only a very few 
	components and hence having a reasonably large probability. This 
	consideration alone makes Shroeder's calculations irrelevant.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Moreover, even if the probability of 
	a spontaneous life emergence is assumed to have been very low, it is not a 
	valid argument against its possibility. Life emerged at some time in the 
	past. Whatever the steps were this process included, it was just one among a 
	very large number N of possible (but by no means equally probable) events. 
	Its calculated probability, however small it happens to be, has by itself no 
	cognitive value. Any other of N possible events could have occurred, but did 
	not. Maybe some of those N-1 events which did not happen would be as complex 
	and amazing as life is. We will never know the answer to that. Hence the 
	argument by Schroeder based on the calculation of probabilities of life 
	emerging through some sequence of randomly occurring chemical reactions is 
	meaningless. Equally unfounded are his calculations of the time allegedly 
	necessary for such reactions to take place. If certain interaction were 
	catalytically enhanced, with each step increasing the likelihood of the next 
	consecutive step toward the emergence of life, the time necessary for the 
	emergence of proteins was actually shorter by many orders of magnitude than 
	that calculated by Schroeder. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Can the above considerations serve 
	as proof that life emerged spontaneously rather than having been created by 
	a divine design? Admittedly, it cannot. However, it shows that the 
	hypothesis of the spontaneous emergence of life does not contradict any 
	probabilistic considerations. The consideration of probabilities by 
	Schroeder cannot serve as a proof to the contrary. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Contrary to his proclaimed 
	intention, Schroeder failed to demonstrate the compatibility of the biblical 
	account with the scientific view in regard to the origin of life, whereas 
	his probabilistic considerations are irrelevant.</font></p>
	<a name="faults">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4. Some specific faults and errors 
	in Schroeder's book</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Besides the above discussed general 
	weaknesses of Schroeder's case, his book contains a plethora of small and 
	not so small specific erroneous statements and arguments. Some of those 
	faults will be discussed in this section. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>1) The Bible code example.</i></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 182 of Schroeder's book, we 
	read: &quot;I offer here only two examples of the thousands of subtleties found 
	in the Bible.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first example offered by 
	Schroeder is that of the so-called Bible code. The Bible code controversy is 
	discussed in detail, for example, at
	<a href="http://members.cox.net/mkarep/">B-Codes Page</a> where the lack of 
	substantiation of the claims of the Bible code proponents is shown. 
	Schroeder's discourse is limited to a few primitive examples which lack any 
	statistical significance and testify to Schroeder's amateurish level of 
	familiarity with the subject he endeavored to discuss </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>2) Is weight and mass the same? 
	Is kinetic energy proportional to velocity? Are the laws of physics &quot;nothing 
	more&quot; than laws of nature?</i> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above questions sound silly if 
	one discusses statements by a physicist, especially one with a Ph.D. degree. 
	Unfortunately, Schroeder provides reason to raise the above questions. For 
	example, on page 40 of his book <a href="#genesis">[1]</a> Schroeder writes 
	: &quot;The mass (or weight) of the object while at rest is called, in technical 
	terms, its rest mass.&quot; I find it hard to believe that a Ph.D. in physics 
	could indeed think that mass and weight are the same. I prefer to interpret 
	the above sentence as a display of sloppiness in style rather than of 
	ignorance. This interpretation is reinforced by the use of the words &quot;in 
	technical terms&quot; which do not seem to convey any meaning. In which <i>
	non-technical terms</i> is the mass &quot;while at rest&quot; called something else 
	rather then rest mass?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately for the above 
	relatively benign interpretation, Schroeder expresses himself in the same 
	way more than once. The same expression &quot;mass (or weight)&quot; appears, for 
	example, on page 37, giving rise to suspicion that Schroeder may actually 
	believe that mass is the same as weight. Such a statement made by an 
	undergraduate student on an exam in general physics would result in an 
	immediate F grade. The rest mass is a body's property, a constant 
	independent of the frame of reference, whereas the total (or relativistic) 
	mass is a function of velocity, and, as such, depends on the choice of frame 
	of reference. The body's weight is a completely different quantity, 
	reflecting the interaction of the body in question with a planet. It depends 
	on both the mass of the body in question and the mass of the planet and, in 
	the first approximation, on the squared distance from that planet's center 
	(assuming the body in question is much smaller than the planet or has 
	spherical shape itself). I am sure Schroeder had studied these facts as a 
	student. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the same page Schroeder writes: 
	&quot;It acquires velocity and in so doing acquires kinetic energy proportional 
	to the velocity.&quot; Come on, Dr. Schroeder! Don't you know that kinetic energy 
	is proportional to <i>squared</i> velocity? Is it sloppiness again? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 41 we find one more 
	expression which, to put it mildly, sounds strange from a Ph.D. in physics. 
	I quote: &quot;...laws of Physics (which are no more than laws of nature)....&quot; 
	Are they indeed? Schroeder seems to be unaware that laws of physics are 
	postulates based on interpretation of experimental evidence. At the best, 
	the laws of physics can be considered our guesses as to what the reasonable 
	approximation of laws of nature can be. Laws of nature supposedly did not 
	change from, say, the 17th to the 20th century, whereas the laws of physics 
	have gone through drastic modifications and many amendments. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are more examples of very 
	dubious statements by Schroeder, and it is immaterial whether they stemmed 
	from a lack of knowledge or a lack of meticulousness in writing a book which 
	supposedly sheds light on important matters. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Just a couple more of examples of 
	less than accurate ways Dr. Schroeder expresses himself. On page 100 we 
	read: &quot;We see randomness of entropy increase in every observable system.&quot; 
	This is gobbledygook. Entropy itself is a measure of disorder, i.e. of 
	randomness. The expression &quot;randomness of entropy&quot; is devoid of any meaning.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Page 117: &quot;The centrifugal force of 
	the spin flattened the cloud into a disk.&quot; This is one more display of 
	either a lack of sufficient understanding or of stylistic sloppiness. 
	Centrifugal force is what is called in physics force of inertia. It is 
	considered to be a fictional force. The real force in this case is 
	centripetal force, caused by gravitation. It is convenient in certain cases 
	to use the concept of centrifugal force when writing certain equations. (It 
	is sometimes referred to as D'Alembert's principle). However, saying that 
	centrifugal force &quot;flattened the cloud&quot; means veiling the essence of the 
	matter in a cloud of a meaningless phraseology. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Further examples of less than 
	reliable statements could be given.</font></p>
	<a name="second">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5. Schroeder's second book</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let us discuss the second book 
	by Schroeder, <i>The Science of God,</i> subtitled &quot;The Convergence of 
	Scientific and Biblical Wisdom&quot; <a href="#science">[2]</a>. It is 
	considerably larger than the first book. Judging by the size and the title, 
	one might expect that the second book would continue and expand on the 
	subject of the first book. Indeed, to some extent it turns out to be true, 
	as Schroeder repeats in his second book a number of points discussed in the 
	first book, partially modifying and adding to them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, the second book 
	differs rather substantially from the first one. One difference is that in 
	the first book Schroeder limited himself to a relatively narrow circle of 
	topics, while in the second book he tries to cover a much larger scope of 
	problems. One of the results is a loss of the sharpness of the book's focus. 
	Various chapters discuss questions sometimes little related to each other, 
	hence, instead of the relatively clear plan in the first book, in the second 
	one we see a farrago of topics and subjects, each discussed separately. This 
	situation dictates as well the form of my review. Unlike with the first 
	book, this time I will discuss various aspects of Schroeder's second book 
	one by one, without subordinating the discussion to any logical sequence.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another peculiarity of Schroeder's 
	second book is its uneven character. One can indicate some well written 
	passages in that book, where the subject is explained correctly and in an 
	easily comprehensible form. On the other hand, many sections contain factual 
	errors, sometimes of an elementary nature and sounding quite odd, if we 
	remember that the writer claims to be an experienced physicist with a Ph.D. 
	degree. We will discuss examples of both types.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, one more feature of the 
	book in question: in this book Schroeder provides data which contradict the 
	data given in his own first book, without a word of explanation. We start 
	with the discussion of precisely this feature.</font></p>
	<a name="change">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6. Change of dates in the second 
	book compared to the first one</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the differences between the 
	first and the second books by Schroeder relates to the chronological data in 
	regard to Noah, the Flood, Tuval-Cain, and the onset of the Bronze age.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his first book, Schroeder 
	calculated that the interval of time between Adam and Tuval-Cain was about 
	1350 years, that Tuval-Cain was a contemporary of Noah, and that the Bronze 
	age started some 4400 years ago (pages 31-32 and Table 2 in the first book
	<a href="#genesis">[1]</a>). In the second book <a href="#science">[2]</a> 
	the onset of the Bronze age is said to have happened about 5000 years ago, 
	i.e. about 600 years earlier than in the first book (see, for example, page 
	131 in <a href="#science">[2]</a>). Furthermore, on page 130 of
	<a href="#science">[2]</a> Schroeder maintains that the time interval 
	between Adam and Tuval-Cain was 700 years, instead of the 1350 years he 
	indicated in <a href="#genesis">[1]</a>. On the other hand, in
	<a href="#science">[2]</a> (page 131) the date of the Flood is said to be 
	about 4100 years ago, which is about 900 years later than that date of the 
	advent of Bronze which is given in that book. According to these altered 
	dates, Tuval-Cain is no longer considered to be Noah's contemporary, since 
	the invention of bronze, attributed by Schroeder to Tuval-Cain, is now said 
	to have happened 900 years earlier than in <a href="#genesis">[1]</a>. 
	Schroeder does not provide a single word of explanation as to why he changed 
	the dates after his first book. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As was indicated in the previous 
	sections of this article, the above alteration of dates was apparently done 
	because somebody had shown to Schroeder the error in his count of 
	generations between Cain and Tuval-Cain in his first book.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If a writer changes his views, are 
	the readers not entitled to at least some explanation? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Despite the change of dates, 
	Schroeder still asserts in his second book that the advent of the Bronze 
	age, according to the archeological data, precisely coincides with the 
	biblical story (as per his calculations). Like in his first book, Schroeder 
	again pretends not to notice the statement in Genesis 4.22 indicating that 
	Tuval-Cain also made tools of iron. Since in the second book the lifetime of 
	Tuval-Cain is shifted back by some 900 years, it makes it even farther in 
	time from the iron age as determined by archeology. This completely 
	undermines Schroeder's chronological exercise. </font></p>
	<a name="zero">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Zero time interval in frames of 
	reference moving with the speed of light?</font></h2>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The section in question (pages 
	161-164) describes the &quot;shrinking of time&quot; in fast moving frames of 
	reference according to the theory of relativity. As that theory asserts, the 
	time interval between two events which occur at the same location within 
	some frame of reference and measured in that frame of reference is always 
	shorter than the time interval between the same events, measured in another 
	frame of reference which moves with a certain speed relative to the first 
	frame of reference, so in that second frame of reference the events in 
	question occur at different locations. The larger the speed of motion of one 
	frame of reference relative to the other one, the larger the difference 
	between the time intervals. If the speed approaches speed of light, the 
	&quot;local&quot; time interval approaches zero. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder considers the example of a 
	light signal which carries information about the explosion of a supernova 
	that occurred 170 thousand years ago (measured in the earth's time). Since 
	the supernova (1978A) is located 170 thousand light years from the earth, 
	the light signal took exactly that long to reach the earth. Since, though, 
	the light signal moves with the speed of light, the flow of time in the 
	frame of reference attached to the signal &quot;stopped.&quot; If there existed an 
	observer &quot;living&quot; in the frame of reference of the signal, (which is 
	impossible as no physical body can move with the speed of light) for &quot;him&quot; 
	the explosion of the supernova and the arrival of the signal on Earth would 
	have happened simultaneously. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder's explanation entails a 
	serious flaw. A frame of reference which can be attached to photons simply 
	does not exist. If it existed, the photons would be at rest in such a 
	system. However, photons cannot be at rest. According to the special theory 
	of relativity, photons always move with the same speed (in vacuum) <i>in 
	every frame of reference</i>. If a frame of reference wherein photons are at 
	rest existed, time would stop in such a frame. Since, though, no such frames 
	of reference are possible, Schroeder's concept is meaningless.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of course, in accordance with his 
	agenda, Schroeder tries to prove the analogy between the described alleged 
	&quot;paradox&quot; of the theory of relativity and the concept of God being &quot;outside 
	time.&quot; The concept of God being &quot;outside time&quot; belongs to the realm of faith 
	and has nothing in common with the non-existing effect of &quot;time stopping&quot; in 
	systems moving with the speed of light. Schroeder's attempt, inadvertently 
	invoking the image of God running with speed of light past stars and planets 
	in order to satisfy the conditions of the theory of relativity, can only 
	discredit Schroeder's approach, and, with it, the concepts of faith 
	themselves. </font></p>
	</a><a name="diffrac">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">8. Diffraction of waves according 
	to Schroeder</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On pages 150-151 in
	<a href="#science">[2]</a> Schroeder explains the diffraction of waves. Like 
	his example about the light signal from a supernova, these paragraphs have 
	been well written. Up to a certain point, Schroeder's explanations are 
	correct and explain the diffraction, using the example of sea waves, in an 
	easily comprehensible form. Unfortunately, in this case too, Schroeder 
	failed to maintain the competent level of discourse throughout his 
	presentation. As long as Schroeder considers diffraction on an opening whose 
	size is close to the wavelength, his explanation is correct. However, it 
	becomes wrong when he talks about openings whose size exceeds the 
	wavelength. Indeed, on page 150 he asserts that diffraction does not take 
	place if the opening's size is larger than the wavelength. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If that assertion were correct, it 
	would make it possible to build optical microscopes with an unlimited 
	magnification. The ingress aperture of a microscope is much larger than the 
	wavelength of visible light. If there were no diffraction on that aperture, 
	then, utilizing a large number of consecutive lenses, one could reach a 
	magnification of many millions without resorting to electron microscopy. 
	Alas, diffraction puts a limit on the resolving power of any optical device, 
	and with it on the useful magnification.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the simplest case of diffraction 
	on a single opening, increasing the opening's size does not eliminate 
	diffraction but rather widens the central diffraction maximum, pushing the 
	maxima of higher order to the opening's edges, and squeezing them closer to 
	each other. Diffraction is inevitable even if one of the opening's edges 
	lies infinitely far, so actually rather than to speak about an opening, in 
	this case one has to consider the wave's motion past the corner of an opaque 
	wall. Diffraction always takes place if there is any constraint imposed on 
	the free propagation of a wave. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above is one of many examples of 
	imprecision typical of Schroeder's style, casting shadow on all of his 
	arguments. </font></p>
	<a name="masers">
	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">9. Diluted heat and masers</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this section I will discuss a 
	number of the particular errors which are abundant in Schroeder's second 
	book. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1) On page 152, at the beginning of 
	a section titled &quot;The discovery of wave-particle duality&quot; Schroeder tells 
	the story of the discovery and interpretation of the photoelectric effect. 
	Here, within a half-page, he manages to accumulate a long list of errors.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder starts with the statement 
	that in 1905 Einstein published the results of experiments that demonstrated 
	what has become known as the &quot;photoelectric effect.&quot; In fact, Einstein did 
	not publish any experimental data on photo effect because he never performed 
	any such experiments. The photoelectric effect was discovered and partially 
	studied by Heinrich Hertz more than 25 years earlier. Einstein offered in 
	his paper a <i>theory </i>of that effect. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder writes further: &quot;Light, 
	shining on certain metals, knocks free a stream of electrons...&quot; In fact, 
	not &quot;certain metals,&quot; but <i>every</i> metal or semiconductor.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder continues: &quot;Einstein 
	demonstrated that the rate at which electrons are emitted from metal is 
	related not only to the intensity of the light beam but also to the color of 
	the light.&quot; This is an incorrect statement. The rate of electron emission, 
	i.e. the number of electrons emitted per second, does depend on the light 
	intensity but does not depend on the &quot;color&quot; of the light. What indeed 
	depends on the &quot;color&quot; of the light, i.e. on the wavelength, is the kinetic 
	energy of the emitted electrons. Also, Einstein did not demonstrate this, as 
	the dependence of electron's kinetic energy, measured via the so- called 
	&quot;stopping voltage, &quot; on the wavelength of light, had already been discovered 
	by Hertz. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2) On page 154 Schroeder describes 
	experiments with a beam of atoms directed toward a plate with slits in it. 
	He wrote: &quot;Here we use a maser, a gun that can fire one atom at a time.&quot; 
	Really? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A reader familiar at least with some 
	rudimentary information in physics or electronics, must wonder whether 
	Schroeder has less understanding of atoms or of masers. It is known that 
	word &quot;maser&quot; is the abbreviation for the expression &quot;Microwave Amplification 
	by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.&quot; No maser is capable of firing atoms, 
	either one by one or in groups. Most commonly masers are used as sources of 
	coherent electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range. A version of a 
	maser that works in the range of visible light is sometimes called the 
	optical maser, but more often, laser, which has by now become a ubiquitous 
	component of many appliances, including, for example, CD players. Schroeder 
	could acquire that information from any technical handbook or textbook.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It would be possible to continue a 
	discussion of many erroneous and unsubstantiated statements in Schroeder's 
	second book.I feel, however, that I have already spent much more time and 
	effort on the analysis of that opus than it deserves. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore I will make only one more 
	comment. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 180 we read: &quot;The cooling 
	effect of an expansion is logical. It is the dilution of a given amount of 
	heat in an ever larger volume.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From the viewpoint of elementary 
	thermodynamics, Schroeder's statement is nothing short of a bad joke. If 
	Schroeder opened a textbook on physics, the chapter on thermodynamics, he 
	would learn or recall that heat cannot be &quot;diluted&quot; in whatever volume. The 
	expression used by Schroeder gives rise to an impression that, however hard 
	it is to believe, he still adheres to the theory of caloric fluid, abandoned 
	by science as erroneous since Rumford (1796). It is a trivial knowledge in 
	physics that heat is not a substance which is contained within a volume.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 183 Schroeder repeats his 
	meaningless statement about &quot;heat dilution.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Heat is defined in thermodynamics as 
	a quantity analogous to work and serving as a measure of energy 
	transformation, provided such a transformation occurs via random molecular 
	interactions. This quantity cannot experience a dilution either at expansion 
	or in any other process. Of course, it is possible that Schroeder improperly 
	used the term heat, actually having in mind a component of the internal 
	energy which is actually the kinetic energy of molecular motion, and which 
	often is referred to as thermal energy. If this is the case, it still does 
	not make Schroeder's notion about the reason for a temperature drop at 
	expansion correct. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the 
	temperature drop at expansion occurs because the work of expansion is done 
	at the expense of the internal energy, and the temperature is the measure of 
	that energy. Expansion causes not a &quot;dilution&quot; of thermal energy, but the 
	decrease of the root-mean-square speed of molecular motion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For example, expansion into vacuum 
	is an isothermal process. This means that if a system expands into vacuum, 
	its temperature remains constant (because no work is done in such a 
	process). Expansion itself cannot cause a system's temperature drop, which 
	occurs only if, in the course of expansion, some work is done by the system.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It should be noted that the 
	application of thermodynamics to the universe as a whole is uncertain (which 
	in no way justifies the ridiculous invention of a &quot;heat dilution&quot; by 
	Schroeder). The theory of universe's expansion after the big bang does not 
	explain where the universe was expanding to. Actually this theory seems to 
	imply that the expansion occurred into &quot;nothing,&quot; whatever the meaning of 
	that word can be. This &quot;nothing&quot; is of course not what within the universe 
	is referred to as vacuum. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above uncertainty calls for a 
	question, why the temperature of the universe dropped along with its 
	expansion? Thermodynamics <i>per se</i> cannot provide a direct and detailed 
	answer to that question. However, we may reasonably expect that at least the 
	most fundamental laws of physics, including the energy conservation law, 
	retain validity when we discuss the expansion of the universe. In view of 
	that, the cooling down of the universe can be hypothesized as the result of 
	the <i>endothermic nature</i> of the processes in which stars, galaxies, 
	chemical elements, etc, had been created out of the primordial &quot;hot soup,&quot; 
	postulated by the theory. Enormous amounts of thermal energy of the 
	primordial &quot;fireball&quot; converted into other forms of energy, including the 
	energy potentially contained in the created masses, as per Einstein's 
	equation (E=mc<sup>2</sup>). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Obviously, to address the complex 
	question of the universe's cooling by inventing the meaningless &quot;dilution of 
	heat in ever increasing volume&quot; tells much more about Schroeder's scientific 
	competence than about the subject of the discussion.</font></p>

	<h2 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">10. Schroeder's third book</font></h2>
	</a>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In his latest book <a href="#hidden">
	[3]</a> Schroeder mainly discusses various aspects of molecular biology, 
	while the sections dealing with physics occupy only a small part of the 
	book. Since I am not an expert in molecular biology, I will not argue 
	against Schroeder's excursion into that marvelous science. Schroeder is a 
	physicist by education hence he is as much a dilettante in biology as I am. 
	Any dispute between him and me in regard to biology would therefore be like 
	a dispute between two blind men regarding the quality of a beautiful 
	landscape painted by a famous artist. However, I am qualified to argue 
	against Schroeder's errors when he endeavors to discuss physics. Given the 
	sad fact that he was awarded a PhD degree in physics by a prestigious 
	institution, the elementary errors in Schroeder's discourse are simply 
	stunning. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is an example. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On page 38 of his book Schroeder 
	suggested the following equation: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">hf=mc<sup>2</sup>.......................(1)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">where <i>h</i> is Planck's constant,
	<i>f</i> is the frequency of deBroglie's wave for a particle, <i>m</i> is 
	the particle's mass and <i>c</i> is speed of light. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whereas equation (1) is absurd, it 
	is easy to figure out how Schroeder derived it. He read somewhere about the 
	following correct equations <a href="#fund">[4]</a>: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1) E=hf.........................(2)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">and 2) E=mc<sup>2</sup>.......................(3)
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Equation (2) was originally 
	suggested by Planck (in 1900) for the quantum of energy emitted by a black 
	body. In 1905, Einstein applied that equation to the energy of photons 
	regardless of whether they are emitted, traveling or absorbed by a material. 
	In 1923 de Broglie suggested to expand the application of that equation to 
	all particles, either massless as a photon or having a <i>rest mass m.</i> 
	As to equation (3), it is probably the most widely known equation of science 
	derived by Einstein in 1905 as a part of his special theory of relativity.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In both equations (2) and (3) <i>E</i> 
	denotes energy of a particle. Obviously lacking proper understanding of 
	these two equations, and seeing the same letter <i>E</i> on the left side of 
	both, Schroeder mechanically combined the equations (2) and (3) into one 
	equation (1). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately for Schroeder, he 
	obviously did not know that <i>E</i> in equation (2) and <i>E</i> in 
	equation (3), while both denoting the energy of a particle, actually denote 
	two different energies. <i>E</i> in equation (2) denotes the <i>variable </i>
	energy of a moving particle, related to that particle's momentum. <i>E</i> 
	in equation (3) is a <i>constant</i> for a given particle, which denotes the 
	so-called rest energy. These two types of particle's energy have little to 
	do with each other. The absurdity of Schroeder's equation (1) is immediately 
	obvious when we notice that it equalizes a variable quantity to a constant. 
	Indeed, the frequency <i>f</i> of de Broglie wave for a particle is <i>not a 
	fixed constant</i> but depends on the particle's momentum, i.e. on its 
	velocity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Schroeder could have easily realized 
	the senselessness of his equation (1) if he thought for a minute what are 
	the values of the quantities in that equation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Planck's constant equals about 
	h=6.626.10<sup>-34 </sup>J.s while the speed of light equals c=2.997.10<sup>8
	</sup>m/s. Let us apply Schroeder's equation (1), for example, to the 
	electron. The mass of an electron is close to 9.1x10<sup>-31</sup>kg. Then 
	the right side of equation (1), i.e. the electron's rest energy is about 
	8.17x10<sup>-14</sup> Joule, or about 5.1x10<sup>5</sup> eV (electron-volt). 
	Hence, if Schroeder's equation (1) were correct, all electrons in the world 
	would always have the same energy of about 5.1x10<sup>5 </sup>eV. To have 
	such level of energy, free electrons must be accelerated by a voltage a 
	little more than half a million volt. Of course, different electrons (as 
	well as any other particles) actually possess different levels of energy in 
	a wide range rather than all having the same energy of about half a million 
	electron-volt. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, an equation formally 
	looking like equation (1) can be legitimately written for the process of 
	particle-antiparticle annihilation. For example, for an electron-positron 
	annihilation an equation looking like (1) would be correct if <i>m</i> 
	denoted the electron's (or, equally, the positron's) mass and <i>h</i>f the 
	energy of one of the two gamma-photons emerging as a result of those 
	particles' mutual annihilation. The imprecision would in this case be only 
	due to neglecting those constituents of the particle's energy which do not 
	originate from its rest mass (such as kinetic energy of the particle's 
	motion etc). Anyway, though, this case has nothing to do with Schroeder's 
	discourse and with de Broglie's wave. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The equation (1) is not the only 
	error in Schroeder's new book. However, it seems sufficient to limit the 
	demonstration of the inaccuracies in Schroeder's literary production to the 
	above examples.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Schroeder's insufficient 
	competence in physics, which is his professional field, is obvious, what 
	credibility can be given to his lengthy discourse on molecular biology which 
	is not his professional field? Moreover, what credibility can be given to 
	his general thesis asserting the alleged harmony between the Bible and 
	science? </font></p>
