		</a>
		<p>Canadian Christian preacher Grant R. Jeffrey is the author of a 
		number of popular books all devoted to one aim, to prove that the Bible 
		reveals the absolute truth, is impeccably consistent and, beyond doubt, 
		is indeed the word of God. His books, while each approaching his task 
		from slightly different angles, have many common features and in many 
		respects repeat similar or even identical arguments. Therefore, to judge 
		the overall level of Jeffrey's discourse and to form an opinion of the 
		quality of his argumentation, it seems sufficient to choose only one of 
		his books, reasonably representative of Jeffrey's writing. The book 
		titled &quot;The Signature of God&quot; (Frontier Research Publishers, Inc, 1996) 
		seems to meet the above condition.</p>
		<p>A reader who opens the book in question encounters several quotations 
		from Jeffrey's fellow admirers of the Bible as a divinely-inspired 
		revelation, who are all immensely impressed and enchanted by Jeffrey's 
		creations. As one of them wrote in regard to some previously published 
		book by Jeffrey, &quot;It is absolutely the most intriguing eye-opening book 
		on end-time events I've come across in a long, long time. It's 
		terrific!&quot; The rest of the opinions about Jeffrey's works equally extol 
		the virtues of his books.</p>
		<p>In this article we will discuss Jeffrey's arguments in order to see 
		whether or not they indeed so brilliantly prove his case.</p>
		<p>The book in question contains an introduction, and fifteen chapters, 
		of which chapters 2 through 14 present various sets of specific 
		arguments allegedly proving that the 44 writers who, according to 
		Jeffrey, wrote various parts of the Bible, were directly guided by God. 
		My intention is to discuss many of these alleged proofs, but I'll do it 
		in an order differing from that chosen by Jeffrey. I'll start with 
		chapters 10 and 11, which I will discuss together, followed by chapter 
		12, because these three chapters most vividly demonstrate the actual 
		intellectual level of Jeffrey's discourse and the degree of his 
		adherence to facts. After discussing the three listed chapters, I will 
		discuss the rest of Jeffrey's book.</p>
		<p>A detailed discussion of every paragraph in Jeffrey's book would 
		require writing another book of about the same size. Fortunately, 
		reviewing some representative examples of Jeffrey's writing will suffice 
		to form an opinion of its quality and reliability. Therefore I will 
		discuss the book in question by reviewing only selected examples of 
		Jeffrey's discourse.</p>
		<h2><a name="bible">2. Jeffrey discusses the Bible Code</h2>
		</a>
		<p>Chapter 10 in Jeffrey's book is titled &quot;The Mysterious Hebrew Codes.&quot; 
		In this chapter Jeffrey tells the readers about what he calls the 
		&quot;staggering phenomenon of hidden codes beneath the Hebrew text of the 
		Old Testament.&quot;</p>
		<p>The existence of the alleged code in question was first claimed by a 
		Slovakian, Rabbi M. D. Weissmandl more than fifty years ago. The alleged 
		code consists of meaningful words which appear in the Hebrew original of 
		the Pentateuch in the form of so-called ELS (which stands for 
		&quot;Equidistant Letter Sequences&quot;). To understand the concept of ELS, look 
		at the phrase &quot;book is titled&quot; in the first line of this section. First, 
		following the practice of the proponents of the alleged code, remove the 
		spaces between the words of that phrase, thereby converting it into an 
		uninterrupted string of letters, which is &quot;bookistitled&quot; (if the phrase 
		in question contained any punctuation marks, they would be removed as 
		well). Now look at the first letter of this written sequence which is 
		&quot;b&quot;, and notice that the fourth letter after &quot;b&quot; in that phrase is &quot;i&quot;. 
		Count four more steps along the text, and notice that the fourth letter 
		after &quot;i&quot; is &quot;t&quot;. The three letters, &quot;b,&quot; &quot;i&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are separated by 
		equal distances along the text and they form a meaningful word &quot;bit.&quot; 
		This is an example of an ELS with a <i>skip</i> of 4. Here is another 
		example. In the beginning of this section, look at the word &quot;readers.&quot; 
		Its last letter is &quot;s&quot;. Now move leftwards, i.e. against the direction 
		of the text. The second letter to the left of &quot;s&quot; is &quot;e&quot;. Continue 
		leftwards, and the second letter to the left of &quot;e&quot; is &quot;a&quot;. The three 
		letters, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;a&quot; are separated by equal distances and form a 
		meaningful word &quot;sea&quot; if read from right to left. This is another ELS 
		with a <i>negative skip</i> of two (-2). It can be easily demonstrated 
		(as it has been actually done many times) that a very large number of 
		ELS appear in any texts in various languages, including Hebrew, English, 
		Russian, etc.</p>
		<p>There is nothing amazing or unexpected in the appearance of numerous 
		ELS in any sufficiently long text, be it the text of the Torah or a 
		Manhattan phonebook. Each language contains an enormous number of words 
		and phrasal combinations and a statistical estimate shows that many of 
		them are expected to appear as ELS in every texts by sheer chance. </p>
		<p>Let us look at how Jeffrey presents the phenomenon of ELS in his 
		book. First, he tells the readers about Rabbi M. D. Weissmandl's 
		discovery of the word <i>Torah</i> as an ELS in the first five books of 
		the Bible. Reading Jeffrey's narrative reveals at once that he is not a 
		stickler in regard to the even well known facts. For example, on page 
		202 Jeffrey tells us that Weissmandl found word <i>Torah</i> &quot;encoded&quot; 
		as an ELS in the book of Genesis with a skip of 7. Actually the skip of 
		that ELS is 50 rather than 7. (On page 206 Jeffrey provides the correct 
		value of that skip). Of course, that small error is not very significant 
		in itself, but it indicates that readers have to be aware of possible 
		inaccuracies by Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>As we read Jeffrey's narrative further, we see more and more of 
		inaccuracies and direct distortions of facts, which are so abundant that 
		it is hard to decide which to discuss first.</p>
		<p>On page 203 Jeffrey tells us about the paper by D. Witztum, E. Rips, 
		and Y. Rosenberg (WRR) that was printed in <i>Statistical Science</i> 
		journal in 1994. In that paper, its authors claimed that pairs of ELS 
		for words related by meaning are situated in the text of the book of 
		Genesis in an unusually close proximity, thus indicating that those ELS 
		happen in the text not due to random chance but rather to a deliberate 
		design. While WRR stopped short of claiming directly that the sets of 
		ELS they studied were placed there by God, such a conclusion was 
		obviously implied. </p>
		<p>Jeffrey did not spare words to highly praise the alleged discovery by 
		WRR which seemed to nicely fit his agenda of proving the divine origin 
		of the Bible. The journal that printed the paper by WRR is, as Jeffrey 
		tells us, &quot;one of the most prominent mathematical and scientific 
		journals in the world.&quot; While the journal in question is indeed a fine 
		scientific publication, its virtues could hardly be evaluated by Jeffrey 
		who, as it can be seen from his dealing with probabilities (see further 
		in this section) betrays his profound ignorance of anything redolent of 
		science in general and of statistics in particular. Jeffrey's accolade 
		was not a result of his familiarity with the journal in question, since 
		he is not only ignorant of the material usually published in that 
		journal, but cannot understand even the very paper by WRR he likes so 
		much. While praising the journal, Jeffrey mentioned in passing the 
		commentary the editors of that journal supplied when printing the paper 
		by WRR. If properly interpreted, that commentary leaves no doubt that 
		the editors did not trust WRR's data and published their paper as a 
		challenge to readers who might be willing to invest enough time and 
		effort to unearth flaws in WRR's paper. </p>
		<p>Jeffrey continues, &quot;Their (WRR&quot;s) discoveries of complex Hebrew codes 
		that reveal supernatural and prophetic knowledge about the future is 
		causing tremendous consternation in the academic community because it 
		challenges the long-held belief of liberal scholars who generally reject 
		verbal inspiration of the Bible.&quot; Two lines further Jeffrey concludes 
		this paragraph as follows: &quot;Despite the fact that numerous scholars and 
		scientists have attempted to challenge the validity of this Torah 
		research, the evidence has not been refuted.&quot; </p>
		<p>Nothing is even remotely true in the above quotation. The immediate 
		question is how does Jeffrey know about the &quot;tremendous consternation&quot; 
		in the scientific community? His occupation is &quot;tremendously&quot; far from 
		any scientific activity. Has he conducted a survey of scientists' views 
		on WRR's paper? Have any number of prominent mathematician ever 
		expressed their consternation? In fact, no &quot;tremendous consternation&quot; 
		was caused by WRR's paper in the scientific community which practically 
		unanimously rejected WRR's paper as a result of a faulty statistical 
		study. Indeed, soon after Jeffrey' book was published, more than fifty 
		prominent experts in mathematical statistics signed a letter posted on 
		the Internet in which they claimed to have personally studied the work 
		by WRR and unequivocally concluded that WRR's results cannot be trusted. 
		Reviewing the signatures on that letter reveals that many of them belong 
		to scientists who are nowhere close to being what Jeffrey refers to as 
		&quot;liberal scholars&quot; since a substantial number of them claim to be 
		faithfully religious. No such document exists in which any group of 
		mathematicians would support WRR's work. </p>
		<p>It is far from true that the alleged evidence presented by WRR was 
		not refuted. On the contrary, in a number of publications the work by 
		WRR was subjected to a detailed critical analysis and the overwhelming 
		consensus among scientists is that WRR's so-called evidence is 
		unsubstantiated (see, for example, the material placed at the websites:
		<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim">In Search of Mathematical 
		Miracles</a> or <a href="http://members.cox.net/mkarep/">B-Codes Page</a></p>
		<p>In his attempts to make his point Jeffrey is using various, sometimes 
		subtle and often not so subtle, manipulation of facts if this serves his 
		goal. Here are a few examples.</p>
		<p>On pages 206-207 Jeffrey returns to the ELS for the word <i>Torah </i>
		allegedly encoded in the book of Genesis with a skip of 50. He tells us 
		that an identical ELS for the word <i>Torah</i> was also found in the 
		second book of the Pentateuch with the same skip, and that a similar ELS 
		but this time with a negative skip (-50) is found in the fourth book and 
		with a smaller negative skip (-49 rather than -50) in the book of 
		Deuteronomy, in the last two cases starting at a certain distance from 
		the books' beginnings. Then Jeffrey refers to unnamed mathematicians who 
		allegedly calculated the probability of the appearance of the mentioned 
		ELS for the word <i>Torah</i> by chance as less than one in three 
		million. What Jeffrey fails to tell is that the actual calculation of 
		probabilities for the appearance of an ELS for the word <i>Torah</i> in 
		the Hebrew text of the Torah (i.e. of four equidistant letters Tav, Vav, 
		Resh, Hey) predicts that such ELS with various skips are expected to 
		appear thousands of times in a text which is over 300,000 letters long. 
		He also omits any discussion of the asymmetry of the four ELS in 
		question. While in the first two books of the Torah the ELS spelling <i>
		Torah </i>start with the first occurrence of the letter <i>Tav</i> from 
		the beginning of the corresponding book, in the fourth and fifth books 
		the ELS for Torah, with negative skips, start well inside the books' 
		texts, and the one in Deuteronomy has a different skip from the other 
		three ELS. Jeffrey also fails to say that the ELS for the word <i>Torah</i> 
		can easily be found in any Hebrew text of sufficient length. This 
		selective narrative by Jeffrey clearly testifies that he is far from 
		being objective but rather tends to emphasize whatever, in his view, 
		supports his agenda, and downplay or even completely omit anything that 
		may testify against his beliefs.</p>
		<p>This described style of Jeffrey's can be illustrated by numerous 
		other examples. On pages 208, 209, and 210 Jeffrey describes examples of 
		ELS in the text of the Bible spelling such words as Hitler, Sadat, and 
		others. He, again, maintains that &quot;many academics rejected out of hand 
		the possibility that this phenomenon could be real.&quot; Of course, Jeffrey 
		avoids mentioning any names of these alleged academics, since it is much 
		safer to argue against unnamed opponents. He continues, &quot;Despite many 
		attempts, no one could refute the data.&quot; This assertion is very far from 
		being true. More than one scientist has convincingly refuted the 
		assertion that the examples of ELS quoted by Jeffrey are something 
		surprising or unique. Similar ELS can be found (and have been found) in 
		abundance in many non-biblical texts. This simple fact in itself shows 
		either the complete lack of impartiality on Jeffrey's part (if he knows 
		about those finds in non-biblical texts) or his profound ignorance of 
		the matter (if he is not familiar with the examples of ELS in 
		non-biblical texts). </p>
		<p>On page 212 Jeffrey refers to professor D. Kazhdan who, as Jeffrey 
		wants us to believe, supports the results of WRR's work. This is not 
		true. All that Kazhdan has ever publicly said about the Bible code was 
		in a letter he signed jointly with two other mathematicians, indicating 
		that WRR conducted &quot;serious research.&quot; He never said that he shared 
		WRR's views or that their data were proven. Subsequently Kazhdan 
		asserted (in private messages) that he never studied WRR' work in detail 
		and therefore has no opinion about the validity of their claim. 
		Moreover, if Jeffrey chose to refer to Kazhdan, why did he not refer to 
		those many mathematicians who studied WRR's work and rejected their 
		results? </p>
		<p>A few lines further on, Jeffrey bestows the title of &quot;Professor&quot; on 
		Doron Witztum who never received that title from any university (Witzum 
		does hold a master's degree in physics, but has not worked as a 
		physicist for many years). True to form, Jeffrey grants the title of 
		Professor also to H. Gans (page 217) who never had such a title but who 
		had formerly been a cryptologists for the USA government and now is 
		Director of Research at Aish HaTorah, the organization that uses the 
		alleged Bible code as the main tool in their effort to induce 
		irreligious or doubting Jews to return to observance. In other words, 
		Mr. Gans is a professional proponent of the codes who makes his living 
		by propagandizing the alleged codes. He hardly could be viewed as an 
		unbiased witness. By attributing to Gans a scientific rank that 
		gentleman never had, Jeffrey is using a thinly veiled attempt to prove 
		that real scientists of high repute support his exaltation with the 
		alleged codes. In reality, with only a very few exceptions, there are 
		almost no serious scientists supporting the alleged codes. (Besides 
		Professor Rips who is one of the authors of the WRR's paper, only one 
		other mathematician, Professor Michelson claimed his belief in codes. 
		Besides these two mathematicians, Professor R. Haralick, who is a 
		prominent expert in the field of pattern recognition, adheres to the 
		opinion that whereas WRR's statistical approach is not satisfactory, the 
		dispute between the proponents and opponents of the codes has not yet 
		been resolved and further study is in order. On the other hand, 
		practically every other mathematician who has expressed any opinion on 
		codes, has rejected WRR's work as statistically flawed). Of course, 
		since Gans is a proponent of the codes, Jeffrey characterizes him as a 
		&quot;brilliant scientist.&quot; In general, everybody who is in favor of codes, 
		is, in Jeffrey's view, either a &quot;world-class&quot; statistician, or a 
		&quot;brilliant mathematician&quot; and Jeffrey does not hesitate to provide them 
		with titles and degrees they never had. </p>
		<p>It is worth mentioning, that Jeffrey's love for WRR is unrequited. 
		Rips and Witztum never refer to Jeffrey. They have said more than once 
		that there is nothing unusual or amazing in finding any number of 
		individual ELS in any texts. Their own work was conducted in a very 
		different manner. They applied a certain apparatus of mathematical 
		statistics to estimate the degree of closeness of pairs of ELS for 
		semantically related words (it is that approach Kazhdan referred to as a 
		serious research). Although there is an almost unanimous consensus among 
		scientists that the study by WRR was faulty and cannot be relied upon, 
		these authors at least went much further than simply pointing to various 
		individual ELS in the text of the Torah, and tried to conduct a 
		statistical study of the phenomenon. Since Jeffrey is obviously not 
		capable of understanding the mathematical apparatus in WRR's work, he 
		had to resort to the primitive method of demonstrating various 
		individual ELS whose appearance has no statistical meaning and which can 
		be found in abundance in any text, as was demonstrated many times over 
		(see, for example, the articles at
		<a href="http://members.cox.net/mkarep/">B-Codes Page</a> where there 
		are also many references to other relevant websites and publications).
		</p>
		<p>On page 214 Jeffrey describes the paper by WRR. True to form, he 
		distorts the paper in question in many ways. For example, he writes on 
		page 214, &quot;Incredibly, the computer program found every single one of 
		the thirty-four names of those famous rabbis embedded in the text of 
		Genesis paired at significantly close proximity with their actual date 
		of birth or their date of death. The odds against these particular names 
		and dates occurring by random chance were calculated by the 
		mathematicians as only one chance in 775 million.&quot; </p>
		<p>Everything is wrong in that statement. To begin with, WRR has claimed 
		the level of confidence for their data to be not one in 775 million but 
		only one in 62,000. As is the norm for his method, Jeffrey substitutes 
		the desired for the actual. He fails to mention that WRR did not find in 
		the book of Genesis ELS either the names or the dates of birth/death for 
		some of the &quot;famous rabbis&quot; listed in the <i>Encyclopedia of Great Men 
		of Israel. </i>Furthermore, he fails to mention that out of 298 possible 
		combinations of names and dates WRR used only 163. He fails to mention 
		that replacing some of the names included by WRR in their list of famous 
		rabbis with some other rabbis' names from the same database dramatically 
		changes WRR's results. He fails to mention that almost all the names and 
		dates used by WRR can be found as ELS in non-biblical texts as well, for 
		example in the Hebrew translation of Tolstoy's novel War and Peace, and 
		that the proximity of ELS for rabbis' names to ELS for the dates of 
		their birth/death in War and Peace can be found to be as close or even 
		closer than in Genesis. He fails to mention that in every test conducted 
		by WRR there were always some mismatched lists of rabbis in which the 
		rabbis' names happened to be closer to their dates of birth/death than 
		in the original (&quot;correct&quot;) list. He fails to mention that in every test 
		by WRR, the ELS for the names of some rabbis were located closer to the 
		ELS for the dates of births/death of other rabbis than to their own 
		dates of birth/death. Overall, Jeffrey's report on WRR's work, which he 
		obviously did not comprehend, distorts that paper to the extent of 
		making that paper unrecognizable. The conclusion is inevitable: either 
		Jeffrey does not know what he is writing about, or he consciously 
		distorts the facts to fit his agenda. While Jeffrey is apparently not 
		above conscious distortions of facts when it suits him, the main reason 
		for his lack of impartiality seems to be his ignorance which makes him 
		see what he wants to see rather than objectively evaluate the evidence.
		</p>
		<p>All over the chapter in question, Jeffrey repeats time and time again 
		his assertion that (unnamed) scientists who approached WRR's data with 
		skepticism, were first baffled by the WRR's results and were then 
		compelled to admit that those results are irrefutable. For example, here 
		is one such statement from page 212 of Jeffrey's book: &quot;Despite the fact 
		that all of the reviewers held previous beliefs against the inspiration 
		of the Scriptures, the overwhelming evidence and the integrity of the 
		data forced the editors to approve the study's scientific accuracy...&quot; 
		Everything is wrong in that statement. First, Jeffrey has no knowledge 
		of the religious beliefs of &quot;all of the reviewers&quot; because even the 
		names of those reviewers except for Professor P. Diaconis, are not in 
		the public domain and none of them, including Diaconis, has ever 
		expressed publicly his/her attitude toward the Scriptures. Second, the 
		editors never said that they were convinced of the &quot;overwhelming 
		evidence and integrity of data&quot; but rather indicated that the results of 
		WRR were baffling and invited readers to look for the faults in WRR's 
		statistical procedure (which was ultimately done by several 
		mathematicians). </p>
		<p>Here is one more, rather vivid example of how Jeffrey presents the 
		desired as if it is the actual. On page 208 we read: &quot;Another 
		fascinating feature of this phenomenon was found, in Genesis 2, which 
		deals with the Garden of Eden. Scientists found twenty-five different 
		Hebrew names of trees encoded within the text of this one chapter. The 
		laws of probability indicate that the odds against this occurring are 
		one hundred thousand to one.&quot; Apparently believing that no human, even 
		Moses himself, could so skillfully encode the names of 25 trees as ELS 
		in a relatively short text, Jeffrey publicly challenged anybody to 
		compile a text of a comparable length in English containing ELS for the 
		names of any 25 trees. Convinced of the invincibility of his position, 
		Jeffrey offered to pay one thousand dollars to anybody who would meet 
		the challenge. In a few weeks, Mr. Gidon Cohen of York, England, 
		presented an English text of some 300 words in which the names of 29 
		trees occurred as ELS. Later, Mr.Cohen compiled a text in which a whole 
		popular poem was &quot;encoded&quot; as a set of ELS. This &quot;encoded&quot; poem can be 
		seen on <a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm">B. McKay's website</a>. </p>
		<p>So much for Jeffrey's persistent statements that only God himself was 
		capable of creating the alleged code comprising multiple ELS. </p>
		<p>To impress his readers, Jeffrey often provides alleged probabilities 
		of the occurrence of this or that ELS, giving extremely small numbers 
		such as one in so many millions, or even one in tens or hundreds of 
		millions, etc, and in one case even one in fifty quadrillions (page 
		206). He refers to (usually unnamed) scientists who allegedly calculated 
		these enormous odds. These numbers one more time reveal Jeffrey's 
		profound ignorance of probabilities as well as his impudence illustrated 
		by his persistent use of those meaningless numbers. (A detailed 
		discussion of the proper calculation of probability can be seen in a 
		paper at <a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/probabilities.cfm">
		Improbable Probabilities</a>. An overwhelming evidence showing that any 
		alleged code in the Bible cited by Jeffrey can be found also in 
		non-biblical Hebrew texts, such as a book titled <i>Ziunim Ze Lo Hakol
		</i>by a contemporary Israeli writer Dan Ben Amotz, or in the textbook 
		on geography of Israel, or in the Hebrew translation of L. Tolstoy's <i>
		War and Peace</i>, can be viewed at
		<a href="http://members.cox.net/mkarep/">B-Codes Page</a> or at
		<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim">In Search of Mathematical 
		Miracles</a> at <a href="http://wopr.com/biblecodes/TheCase.htm">The 
		Case Against the Codes</a>. This simple fact shows that all those 
		&quot;amazing&quot; discoveries of various sets of ELS in the Bible cited by 
		Jeffrey are meaningless and happen there by sheer chance. </p>
		<h2><a name="yeshua">3. My name and his name is Yeshua, or is it?</h2>
		</a>
		<p>However untrustworthy is chapter 10 in Jeffrey's book, it pales in 
		comparison with the display of ignorance and distortions we see in 
		chapter 11 titled <i>The Name of Jesus Encoded in the Old Testament </i>
		with the subtitle &quot;Yeshua is My Name.&quot; In this chapter Jeffrey refers to 
		&quot;research&quot; conducted by one Yacov Rambsel. The latter is a messianic 
		pastor who has spent years searching, without using a computer, for such 
		ELS in the Bible which &quot;encode&quot; information about Jesus as the Messiah. 
		It is well known that the Old Testament never mentions the name of Jesus 
		of Nazareth (whose name, of course, is mentioned abundantly in the New 
		Testament). It is also known that Yeshua is an abbreviated name whose 
		full Hebrew version is Yehoshua. There is plenty of material in the Old 
		Testament about Yehoshua Bin-Nun, but not a word about Yehoshua 
		nicknamed Yeshua, born in the city of Bethlehem, who spent his early 
		years in the hometown of his parents Joseph and Mary, Nazareth, and died 
		on a cross at the age of about 33 on the Golgotha hill near Jerusalem.
		</p>
		<p>Rambsel and Jeffrey maintain that the name of Jesus was &quot;encoded&quot; in 
		the Old Testament as ELS with various skips, together with other words 
		forming phrases such as<i> Yeshua Shmi (</i>&quot;My name is Jesus&quot;), <i>
		Yeshua More</i> (&quot;Jesus Teacher&quot;), <i>Yeshua Yakhol</i> (&quot;Jesus can&quot;, or 
		&quot;Jesus is able&quot;), <i>Dam Yeshua</i> (&quot;Blood of Jesus&quot;) and the like. For 
		example, on page 223 Jeffrey wrote: &quot;...God has hidden at equally spaced 
		intervals in the Hebrew text the incredible message that 'Yeshua is My 
		Name.'&quot; This is one of the most astonishing and tremendous biblical 
		discoveries in the last two thousand years.&quot;</p>
		<p>Of course, even if the existence of a code deliberately placed in the 
		Bible were proven, for anyone who is not obsessed with the desire to 
		find the name of Jesus of Nazareth in the Old Testament, the natural 
		question would be: &quot;How can we determine which Yeshua is meant by such a 
		'code?' What is so amazing about somebody just saying that his name is 
		Yeshua? However, this question is moot because actually the very 
		existence of an alleged <i>Yeshua code</i> deliberately placed in the 
		Old Testament can easily be refuted.</p>
		<p>Before discussing arguments against the Yeshua code, let us look at 
		some examples of such a code offered by Jeffrey. On the very last 
		(unnumbered) page of Jeffrey's book he presented six examples under the 
		heading &quot;Yeshua Coded in the Old Testament Prophecies.&quot; Apparently these 
		six examples were provided to Jeffrey by Rambsel. We are not discussing 
		here Rambsel's writings, but we can briefly state that the good pastor 
		has displayed in his books such a deep ignorance of certain subjects he 
		has tried to handle (for example, calculation of probabilities) that 
		quotations from Rambsel may only render any publication the butt of 
		jokes. The amusing point is that none of the six examples printed at the 
		end of Jeffrey's book spells the word Yeshua but rather meaningless 
		combinations like Yashaua, Yasvei and the like. The detailed discussion 
		of the six examples in question can be found at
		<a href="http://members.cox.net/mkarep/">B-Codes Page</a>. Reviewing the 
		examples in question reveals a simple fact: Jeffrey is ignorant of 
		Hebrew as well as of many other subjects he pretends to have knowledge 
		of.</p>
		<p>Of course, Jeffrey's ignorance of Hebrew does not mean the absence of 
		the ELS spelling words Yeshua Shmi, Dam Yeshua and the like, in the text 
		of the Old Testament. On the contrary, these words are very likely to be 
		found quite often as ELS in any Hebrew text of sufficient length 
		including the text of the Old Testament. Therefore locating all those 
		alleged &quot;codes&quot; as ELS containing the four letters Yud, Shin, Vav, and 
		Ayin in the Old Testament did not constitute any discovery, was not 
		amazing in the least and could not serve as proof of any beliefs or 
		views. If Rambsel and Jeffrey were scientists in the pursuit of truth 
		rather than religious zealots prone to interpret anything they could lay 
		their hands on as confirmations of their preconceived views, they would 
		have tested many others, non-biblical texts to see if analogous ELS can 
		be located in those texts as well. They never did. If they did, they 
		would easily find an endless number of ELS spelling Yeshua Shmi, Dam 
		Yeshua, Yeshua Yakhol etc, in any non-biblical texts thus depriving the 
		occurrences of such ELS of any special meaning. Many examples to that 
		effect can be viewed at <a href="http://members.cox.net/mkarep/">B-Codes 
		Page</a> where the pertinent ELS are shown, found in the book of a 
		contemporary Israeli writer and in the textbook of geography of Israel.</p>
		<p>As mentioned before, the main proponents of the &quot;codes,&quot; Rips and 
		Witztum, as well as their supporters, dismiss Rambsel's and Jeffrey's 
		books as nonsense. In particular, Rabbi D.Mechanic, who is one of the 
		most ardent supporters of the &quot;codes&quot; in general and of Rips and Witztum 
		in particular, has shown many examples of ELS in the Old Testament 
		spelling such phrases as Yeshua Shakran (Jesus crook), Yeshua Navi 
		Sheker (Jesus false prophet) and the like. There are similar examples 
		provided by Dr. J. Price, who is a Bible expert and a Christian pastor. 
		Dr. Price, who is a believing Christian, concluded that the alleged 
		&quot;codes&quot; do not exist. Jeffrey, whose religious beliefs are, of course, 
		his personal matter, should have followed the example of his fellow 
		co-religionist and to admit that all his fascination with the &quot;codes&quot; 
		was just a result of his insufficient familiarity with the subject.</p>
		<h2><a name="seven">4. Seven times seven etc.</h2>
		</a>
		<p>Chapter 12 in Jeffrey's book is titled &quot;The Mathematical Signature of 
		God in the Words of Scripture.&quot; In this chapter Jeffrey tells the 
		readers, with his usual abundance of such epithets as &quot;fascinating,&quot; 
		&quot;incredible,&quot; and &quot;staggering,&quot; about the multiple occurrences of number 
		&quot;seven&quot; in the text of the Bible, allegedly forming an intricate pattern 
		which, if we believe Jeffrey, could exist only due to God's deliberate 
		design. Let us quote Jeffrey (page 230): &quot;This character of God is 
		consistent with the revealed phenomenon of staggering complexity 
		involving mathematical pattern within the text of the Scriptures.&quot;</p>
		<p>Let us omit the question of Jeffrey's uncanny ability to judge God's 
		character, and discuss instead his particular statements regarding the 
		mathematical pattern allegedly woven into the text of the Scriptures by 
		God. </p>
		<p>In his description of the pattern involving number &quot;seven,&quot; Jeffrey 
		refers to one Ivan Panin whom Jeffrey characterizes as a &quot;fascinating 
		and famous mathematician&quot; (page 230). In fact, Ivan Panin hardly can be 
		referred to as a mathematician since he had no mathematical education, 
		never published any mathematical papers and his dubious claim to fame is 
		based only on his work concerning the occurrences of number &quot;seven&quot; in 
		the Bible.</p>
		<p>Let us again quote from Jeffrey (page 231): &quot;Panin completed an 
		astonishing study during the course of fifty years that revealed the 
		most amazing mathematical pattern beneath the surface layer of the text 
		of the Bible.&quot;</p>
		<p>Jeffrey proceeds to explain the way numbers are written in Hebrew. 
		That language has no separate characters for numerals, which are 
		represented by letters of the alphabet. Here are the numerical values of 
		the letters in question: alef=1, bet=2, gimel=3, dalet=4, hey=5, vav=6, 
		zayin=7, khet=8, tet=9, yud=10, kaf=20, lamed=30, mem=40, nun=50, 
		samekh=60, ayin=70, pey= 80, tzade=90, qoph=100, resh=200, shin=300, 
		tav=400. To express any number, combinations of the above letters are 
		used. For example, one hundred and thirty-three can be written as one 
		hundred + thirty + three, that is Qoph-Lamed-Gimel, or it can be written 
		as ninety+forty+three (Tzade-Mem-Gimel), or as sixty+forty+two+one 
		(Samekh-Mem-Bet-Aleph). Of course, not all possible combinations are 
		commonly used, as there are some traditional ways to write numbers. For 
		example, thirty-five is usually written as thirty+five (Lamed-Hey) 
		rather than twenty+ten+five.</p>
		<p>Then Jeffrey suggests to imagine that a similar system is applied to 
		the English alphabet. If this were the case, the numerals would be 
		represented as follows: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5, f=6, g=7, h=8, i=9, 
		j=10, k=20, l=30, m=40, n=50, o=60, p=70, q=80, r=90, s=100, t=200, 
		u=300, v=400, w=500, x=600, y=700, and z=800. Then, for example, one 
		hundred and thirty-three could be represented as either SLC, or as RMC, 
		or, say, as QNBA, and the like.</p>
		<p>Having explained the rule for representing the numerals in Hebrew, 
		Jeffrey turns to what he calls &quot;A Listing of the Phenomenal Features of 
		Sevens Found in Genesis 1&quot; (page 233).</p>
		<p>Jeffrey cites the very first sentence of the book of Genesis, which 
		in Hebrew is: &quot;Bet-Resh-Aleph- Shin-Yud-Tav, Bet-Resh-Aleph, 
		Aleph-Lamed-Hey-Yud-Mem, Aleph-Tav, Hey-Shin-Mem-Yud-Mem, Vav-Aleph-Tav, 
		Hey-Aleph-Resh-Tsade.&quot; (In that rendition, I separated words by commas, 
		and the letters within words, by hyphens. Also, in the Hebrew original 
		the text is read from right to left while in the above rendition the 
		letters are listed from left to right). The traditional translation of 
		that sentence is &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the 
		earth.&quot;</p>
		<p>The listing of the &quot;Phenomenal Features&quot; in the above sentence is 
		given by Jeffrey on page 233 as follows:<ol>
			<li>The number of Hebrew words.......Seven</li>
			<li>The number of letters equals 28 (28/4=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The first three Hebrew words....... contain 14 letters 
			(14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The last four Hebrew words .......contain 14 letters 
			(14/3=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The fourth and the fifth words have seven letters.......Seven</li>
			<li>The sixth and the seventh words have 7 letters.......Seven</li>
			<li>The three key words: God, heaven and earth have 14 letters 
			(14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The number of letters in the four remaining words is 14 
			(14//2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The middle word is the shortest with 2 letters. However, in 
			combination with the word to the right or left, it totals 7 
			letters.......Seven</li>
			<li>The numeric value of the first, middle and last letters is 
			133.......(133/19=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The numeric value of the first and last letters of all seven 
			words is 1393.......(1393/199=7).......Seven</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Having shown the above list of 11 &quot;phenomenal features,&quot; Jeffrey 
		tells the readers (page 233) that &quot;when professors on the mathematical 
		faculty at Harvard university were presented with this biblical 
		phenomenon they naturally attempted to disprove its significance... 
		However, after valiant efforts these professors were unable to duplicate 
		this incredible mathematical phenomenon.&quot; Of course, true to form, 
		Jeffrey did not name those Harvard professors of mathematics, neither 
		did he tell us how and where their failure was reported. The reason for 
		that omission is that Jeffrey would not be able to name those 
		mathematicians even if he wanted to. This entire statement is fantasy. 
		In fact, Panin's alleged discoveries have been convincingly shown to be 
		unsubstantiated, as can be seen, for example, in McKay's web site at
		<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/panin.html">Ivan Panin and 
		Friends</a>. Although I am not a professor of mathematics at Harvard I 
		will give examples illustrating the complete lack of significance in the 
		alleged &quot;phenomenal features of sevens&quot; in the quoted sentence from the 
		book of Genesis.</p>
		<p>Before providing those examples, let us turn first to Jeffrey's 
		persistent attempts to exaggerate the significance of the alleged 
		discoveries he is so fascinated with. Some of the eleven &quot;phenomenal 
		features&quot; listed above are just repeating each other. For example, 
		feature 3 is that the number of letters in the first three words of the 
		sentence in question is 14. Simple arithmetic indicates that the number 
		of letters in the last four words is also 14, since the total number of 
		letters in the sentence is 28. Hence, feature 4 is actually a 
		consequence of features 2 and 3, and listing it as an additional 
		&quot;phenomenal feature&quot; is just a device to increase the number of alleged 
		&quot;phenomenal features&quot; and thus impress the readers with the sheer number 
		of alleged miraculous features. Likewise, feature 8 is just an 
		arithmetic consequence of features 2 and 7 and its separate listing is 
		again due to Jeffrey's zeal in his trying to hammer, by whatever means, 
		his beliefs into his readers' brains.</p>
		<p>Feature 10, as per Jeffrey's listing, is that the first, the middle 
		and the last letters of this sentence have the numerical value of 133 
		which is divisible by 7. However, as it is quite often with Jeffrey's 
		assertions, this statement is misleading. Since the sentence consists of 
		an even number of letters (28), it has no middle letter. To get the 
		quoted number, 133, it is necessary to add the numerical values of four 
		rather than of three letters, namely the first (<i>Bet</i>), the last (<i>Tsade</i>) 
		and the two letters in the middle of the sentence, <i>Mem</i> and <i>
		Aleph</i>.</p>
		<p>Finally, let us view the examples I promised a few lines earlier. I 
		will list the features observed in my examples in exactly the same way 
		as done by Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>As my first example, I will write a short statement which will 
		express my view of the first sentence in the book of Genesis as follows: 
		&lt;IN THIS SENTENCE I SEE NO MIRACLES.&gt;</p>
		<p>Let us look at my statement printed above in capitals. It is obvious 
		that this sentence was not contrived using any special tricks as its 
		gist is germane to the ongoing discussion.</p>
		<p>What we see in that sentence is as follows:
		<ol>
			<li>The number of words is 7.......Seven</li>
			<li>The number of letters equals 28 (28/4=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The first three words contain 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The last four words have 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The word in the middle (I) is the shortest but together with the 
			word to the left and the two words to the right it totals 14 letters 
			(14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The numerical value of the last letters of all seven words is 
			329.......(329/47=7).......Seven </li>
			<li>The number of letters in the words occupying odd positions is 
			21.......(21/3=7).......Seven </li>
			<li>The number of letters in the words occupying even positions is 
			7.......Seven </li>

			<li>The numerical value of all letters of the verb is

			<li>The sum of numerical values of every<i> seventh</i> letter (i.e. 
			of e, i, i, and s) is 245 (245/35=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>(where also 35/5=7).......Seven</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I decided to stop listing the &quot;phenomenal&quot; seven-related patterns in 
		my sentence when I completed 22 items, thus making it exactly twice as 
		many as in Jeffrey's list for the first sentence of Genesis. Many of the 
		above features are exactly like those listed by Jeffrey/Panin for the 
		first sentence in Genesis.</p>
		<p>Some of the features listed by Panin/Jeffrey for the beginning 
		sentence of Genesis (features 5, 6 and 7) are absent from the list of 
		features in my statement printed in capitals. On the other hand, in my 
		statement there are a number of features which are absent from 
		Panin/Jeffrey's list but seem to be the even more interesting 
		coincidences. It is easy to imagine Jeffrey's delight if he could 
		include such &quot;phenomenal&quot; features in his list regarding the first 
		sentence of the Bible.</p>
		<p>Could it be that I came up with my sentence by &quot;incredible&quot; (one of 
		Jeffrey's favored epithets) luck and that such coincidences are 
		extremely rare? OK, let us look at another sentence, which is again my 
		own statement relevant to our discussion: &lt;THE SEVENS OCCUR IN EVERY OLD 
		TEXT.&gt;</p>
		<p>While I would add that &quot;sevens&quot; happen in new texts as often as in 
		the old ones, what we see in the above sentence is as follows:<ol>
			<li>It consists of seven words.......Seven</li>
			<li>It contains 28 letters (28/4=7).......Seven </li>
			<li>The first three words contain 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The last four words also contain 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The middle word (IN) is the shortest with 2 letters. However, in 
			combination with the word to the right or left it totals 7 
			letters.......Seven</li>
			<li>7. 8. The numerical value of all letters which are in odd 
			positions in an odd-numbered word and also in odd positions in the 
			sentence total 1715=7*7*7*5..............(Seven, Seven, Seven)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There are more seven-related coincidences in that sentence, and 
		readers are welcome to look for them. </p>
		<p>Maybe it was again my &quot;incredible luck&quot; to come across a second 
		sentence with all those seven-related coincidences? Here is one more: 
		&lt;NO WONDER YOU SEE SEVEN IN GENESIS.&gt; Again, this sentence is not about 
		some arbitrary topic. It is fully relevant to the subject of discussion.<ol>
			<li>How many words in that sentence? Surprise, surprise, 
			seven!.......Seven</li>
			<li>How many letters? Of course, the reader has already successfully 
			guessed  28 letters.......(28/4=7).......Seven </li>
			<li>How many letters in the first four words? Is it fourteen? No 
			kidding? Yes, fourteen........(14/2=7).......Seven </li>
			<li>How many letters in the last three words? Yes, Mr. Jeffrey, 
			fourteen letters (14/2=7). What a miracle!.......Seven</li>
			<li>The numeric value of the first letters of all seven words is 875 
			(875/125=7). Isn't that nice?.......Seven</li>
			<li>The numeric value of the last letters of all seven words is 1316 
			(1316/188=7). Incredible!.......Seven</li>
			<li>What is the sum of numerical values of the first and last 
			letters of all seven words? Check it  it is 2121 (2121/303=7). 
			Isn't this &quot;incredible,&quot; &quot;surprising&quot; and &quot;staggering,&quot; Mr. Jeffrey, 
			using your favorite expressions?.......Seven</li>
			<li>Also, one more &quot;miraculous&quot; coincidence in the sentence in 
			question: the sum of numeric values of every <i>fourteenth</i> 
			letter (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>is 105 (105/15=7).......Seven </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Maybe such coincidences are easier to locate if the sentence has 28 
		letters? Let us see. Here is a sentence, expressing Mr. Jeffrey's view 
		of the Harvard mathematicians: </p>
		<p>HARVARD MATHEMATICIANS WERE CONFOUNDED BY PANIN'S PUZZLE. </p>
		<p>Here are some of the patterns in that sentence.
		<ol>
			<li>It contains seven words.</li>
			<li>It consists of 49 letters (49/7=7). </li>
			<li>The numerical value of all letters is 5390 (5390/770=7).</li>
			<li>The verbs in that sentence have 14 letters (14/2=7). </li>
			<li>The first word has seven letters. </li>
			<li>The numerical value of vowels in the nouns is 343 (343/49=7).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Many more sevens can be identified in that sentence. </p>
		<p>When one of my friends read the draft of this paper, he sent me his 
		opinion of it. Here is an excerpt from his message: </p>
		<p><i>Dear Mark, after reading your article on Jeffrey/Panin, I decided 
		that PROFESSOR MARK PERAKH'S NUMERICAL SENTENCES ARE WONDROUS! </i></p>
		<p>Imagine my surprise to discover that this sentence has
		<ul>
			<li>number of words = 7</li>
			<li>number of letters = 7 x 7</li>
			<li>total numerical value = 7 x 7 x 68 (Not to mention many other 
			patterns of 7.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There is little doubt that many readers can easily compile many more 
		examples of sentences with a host of allegedly miraculous seven-related 
		patterns. </p>
		<p>Maybe creating sentences with a pattern of sevens is easier in 
		English than it is in Hebrew? Let us then try some Hebrew examples. </p>
		<p>The initial words of Genesis in the Hebrew original are &quot;<i>B'reshit 
		bara Elohim et hashamaim veet haarets</i>&quot; which is translated in the 
		King James version as &quot;<i>In the beginning God created the heaven and 
		the earth</i>.&quot; While that translation is reasonably close to the 
		original, the expression &quot;<i>B'reshit</i>&quot; could be more accurately 
		translated as <i>First</i> (&quot;First God created ...&quot; etc). The expression 
		&quot;In the beginning&quot; more precisely is matched by the Hebrew expression &quot;<i>B'hatkhalah</i>.&quot; 
		So, in my example, I will use the latter expression. Furthermore, while 
		in Genesis 1 we read the word &quot;<i>bara</i>&quot; translated in the King James 
		version as &quot;<i>created</i>,&quot; in Genesis 2 the word &quot;<i>yatsar</i>&quot; is 
		mostly used instead, translated as &quot;<i>formed</i>.&quot; I will use &quot;<i>yatsar</i>&quot; 
		in my example.</p>
		<p>Here is my example: &lt;<i>B'HATKHALAH YATSAR ELOHIM ET HAADAMAH VEET 
		HAMAIM</i>.&gt; </p>
		<p>The translation of that Hebrew sentence is: &quot;<i>In the beginning God 
		formed the land and the waters</i>.&quot; </p>
		<p>Rendered in Hebrew letters, my sentence is as follows: </p>
		<p>BET-HEY-TAV-CHET-LAMED-HEY, YUD-TSADE-RESH, ALEPH-LAMED-HEY-YUD-MEM, 
		ALEPH-TAV, HEY-ALEPH-DALET-MEM-HEY, VAV-ALEPH-TAV, HEY-MEM-YUD-MEM.&quot; </p>
		<p>It is easy to see that my example differs completely from the first 
		sentence of Genesis in its choice of words (and hence of letters) except 
		for the word <i>Elohim</i> (God) and the preposition &quot;Aleph-Tav&quot; (<i>et</i>) 
		which has no equivalent in English but is used in Hebrew to indicate the 
		proper relationship between a verb and a noun. </p>
		<p>What we see in the above Hebrew sentence I composed, is as follows:<ol>
			<li>The number of words is seven.......Seven</li>
			<li>The number of letters is 28 (28/4=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The first three words have 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The last four words have also 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The middle word (Aleph-Tav) is the shortest with 2 letters. 
			However, combined with a word to the left or to the right, it totals 
			7 letters.......Seven </li>
			<li>The three &quot;key&quot; words: God, land, and waters, have 14 letters 
			(14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The remaining four words also have 14 letters.......Seven</li>
			<li>The sum of numeric values of first and last letters of all seven 
			words is 1120(1120/160=7).......Seven</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Listing the above features, I followed exactly what Jeffrey did for 
		the first sentence in Genesis.</p>
		<p>Maybe the last example was easy to compose because the gist of that 
		sentence was somehow similar to that of the first sentence in Genesis? 
		Well, then let us try to compose some other Hebrew sentence, relevant to 
		the subject of our discussion. Here is such a sentence:</p>
		<p>&quot;<i>BEDUGMAOT HAELE EIN SHUM NESIM O PLAIIM</i>.&quot;</p>
		<p>It translates as follows: &quot;In these examples there are no wonders or 
		miracles.&quot;</p>
		<p>In Hebrew letters, this sentence is as follows: 
		BET-DALET-GIMEL-MEM-ALEPH-VAV-TAV, HEY-ALEPH-LAMED-HEY, ALEPH-YUD-NUN, 
		SHIN-VAV-MEM, NUN-SAMEKH-YUD-MEM, ALEPH-VAV, PEY-LAMED-ALEPH-YUD-MEM.</p>
		<p>We see in that sentence the following features:<ol>
			<li>It contains seven words.......Seven</li>
			<li>It has 28 letters (28/4=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The first three words have 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The last four words have also 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The sum of numeric values of every seventh letter, if read in 
			the Hebrew original from left to right, is 308 
			(308/44=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The sum of numeric values of the last letters of all seven words 
			is 581 (581/83=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The sum of numeric values of the first, last and two middle 
			letters is 392 (392/56=7).......Seven</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Since we have used three examples of 28 letters-long sentences in 
		English, let us make our exercise symmetric by adding one more example 
		in Hebrew. Here is one more Hebrew sentence: </p>
		<p>&quot;<i>BEHEKHLET KAL LIMTZO SHEVA BETOKH GIRSOT SHONOT</i>.&quot;</p>
		<p>Its translation is &quot;<i>It is definitely easy to find seven in various 
		versions of texts</i>.&quot; Obviously, this sentence is again relevant to 
		the subject under discussion. In Hebrew letters it is as follows: </p>
		<p>BET-HEY-KHET-LAMED-TET, QOPH-LAMED, LAMED-MEM-TZADE-ALEPH, 
		SHIN-BET-AYIN, BET-TAV-VAV-KHET, GIMEL-RESH-SAMEKH-VAV-TAV, 
		SHIN-VAV-NUN-VAV-TAV.</p>
		<p>The features we see in that sentence are as follows:<ol>
			<li>It contains seven Hebrew words.......Seven</li>
			<li>It consists of 28 letters (28/4=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The first four words have 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The last three words have also 14 letters (14/2=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The middle word (SHIN-BET-AYIN) has only three letters, but 
			combined with a word to the left or to the right, totals 7 
			letters........Seven</li>
			<li>The first and the second words have seven letters.......Seven</li>
			<li>The third and the fourth words have 7 letters.......Seven </li>
			<li>The numeric value of the first letters of all seven words is 357 
			(357/51=7).......Seven</li>
			<li>The sum of numeric values of every <i>seventh</i> 
			letter.......Seven</li>
			<li>is 560 (560/80=7).......Seven</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I believe the above examples provide ample evidence that 
		seven-related pattern are common, not only in the above examples, but in 
		any texts, both in English and in Hebrew. I leave it to the readers to 
		try identifying more of the &quot;sevens&quot; in my examples.</p>
		<p>Hence, we see that many seven-related coincidences occur by chance in 
		any text, biblical and non-biblical. Therefore Panin's and Jeffrey's 
		fascination with those alleged miracles is just an indication that they 
		lacked elementary skills and the willingness to properly verify any 
		observations which seemed to be &quot;incredible&quot; before claiming to have 
		discovered a miracle.</p>
		<p>The listing of &quot;phenomenal features&quot; in my examples could be 
		continued, and examples of sentences with similar coincidences could be 
		easily multiplied, but I believe I have already spent too much time 
		showing the obvious lack of significance in Panin/Jeffrey's exercise 
		with the &quot;sevens.&quot; (Other examples of coincidences involving number <i>
		seven</i> in non-biblical texts can be seen on
		<a href="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm">McKay's web site</a>). Is there any 
		principal difference between pattern of &quot;sevens&quot; in the text of the 
		Bible and those in my examples? None whatsoever.</p>
		<p>The readers can now decide whether or not they should believe 
		Jeffrey's assertion that professors of mathematics from Harvard 
		University were unable to (I am quoting Jeffrey): &quot;construct a sentence 
		about any topic they choose&quot; in English, which would incorporate 
		features similar to those Panin discovered in Genesis. Using Jeffrey's 
		own expressions (page 82) we can justifiably assert that Jeffrey has 
		displayed &quot;unbelievable arrogance&quot; when he was &quot;sitting in judgment&quot; of 
		professors of mathematics.</p>
		<p>On page 234 Jeffrey tells us that he tried to compile a text 
		containing pattern of sevens himself but failed and therefore came to 
		the conclusion that no human could have done it unless directly guided 
		by God. Jeffrey writes: &quot;I tried and it is impossible to complete a 
		paragraph on any topic and remain true to the system of interlocking 
		sevens.&quot; On page 238, he provides a variation of the same categorical 
		assertion: &quot;...any honest attempt to create a paragraph on any subject 
		that will contain this astonishing pattern of mathematical features 
		within the surface text will utterly fail.&quot; Then Jeffrey continues by 
		asserting that even a super-computer cannot produce a passage with 
		sevens like those found in the Bible.</p>
		<p>First of all, even if that statement were true, it would be 
		irrelevant because no one claims that the occurrence of the patterns of 
		sevens in the Bible is a result of a deliberate effort by human writers. 
		The most reasonable explanation of the patterns in question is that they 
		occur <i>by chance</i> in every sufficiently long text.</p>
		<p>Second, regardless of the origin of the patterns of sevens, Jeffrey's 
		assertion that no human mind and even not a super-computer are capable 
		of creating such intricate mathematical webs in a text, calls for a 
		reminder that Jeffrey was equally confident that no human could create a 
		text containing ELS for 25 names of trees (see the preceding section). 
		This confidence cost Jeffrey a thousand bucks. It would be wise for him 
		to be a little more cautious when making such predictions.</p>
		<p>When Jeffrey tried to create a text with ELS for 25 names of trees, 
		and when he tried to create a paragraph with a pattern of sevens, he 
		failed. This failure has led him to the conclusion that in both cases 
		the task was beyond the capabilities of anybody but God.</p>
		<p>The obvious flaw of that argument is that Jeffrey had chosen the 
		wrong measure  his own personal intellectual power. To explain what I 
		mean, I will give an example.</p>
		<p>I would challenge Mr. Jeffrey to start with writing a sonnet. A 
		sonnet is a short poem with a strictly prescribed form. Every sonnet 
		consist of 14 lines, usually divided into four stanzas, the first and 
		the second of them each four lines long, and the third and the fourth 
		ones three lines long. The lines must rhyme following a certain pattern. 
		Of course, the sonnet, besides following the strictly prescribed form, 
		must also express certain feelings and/or ideas in a poetic form. I 
		don't think we can expect a good sonnet from Mr. Jeffrey any time soon. 
		However, if, contrary to expectations, Mr. Jeffrey creates a reasonably 
		good sonnet, my second challenge would be to him to write a &quot;wreath of 
		sonnets.&quot;</p>
		<p>The latter is the most difficult form of poetic creation. It consists 
		of 15 sonnets. They all must relate to a single common idea, but relate 
		to it from various angles, subtly exploring it in depth. The last line 
		of sonnet 1 must become the first line of sonnet 2, the last line of 
		sonnet 2 must be the first line of sonnet 3, etc. The first lines of 
		each of the 14 sonnets must constitute the last, fifteenth sonnet. All 
		this structure of interlocking rhymes, lines, and phrasal expressions 
		contains an intricate mathematical pattern, partly involving &quot;sevens&quot; 
		and not any less complex than that of the sevens in the Bible Jeffrey is 
		so amazed with, even if only because the pattern in the combination of 
		15 sonnets must also obey strict semantic limitations, while the pattern 
		of sevens in the Bible needs only to follow some mechanical arithmetic 
		rules not related to the meaningful message.</p>
		<p>Imagine that Mr. Jeffrey tried to create a meaningful wreath of 
		sonnets. There is a very good chance he would fail. However, even if Mr. 
		Jeffrey, as well as many of his readers, cannot write wreaths of 
		sonnets, many poets can. Some of them wrote more than one such wreath, 
		without a computer, and many of those creations have been commonly 
		acclaimed as great poetry.</p>
		<p>Would Mr. Jeffrey claim that, since he cannot write a wreath of 
		sonnets, nobody can? Then, why does he think that nobody can compose a 
		text with the patterns of seven just because he tried and failed?</p>
		<p>What a pity that unlike in the case of the alleged Bible code, 
		Jeffrey did not offer to pay a thousand bucks to anybody who would 
		compile (I am quoting Jeffrey, page 234) a &quot;paragraph of over one 
		hundred and fifty words following such pattern of sevens as found in 
		Genesis 1.&quot; If he did, some people would have a chance to join Mr. Gidon 
		Cohen in making Mr. Jeffrey poorer by a few more simoleons (of course, 
		if any of them chose to spend the time necessary to complete that boring 
		and senseless task).</p>
		<p>Conclusion: the allegedly &quot;phenomenal&quot; features involving the number
		<i>seven</i>, discovered by Panin in the Bible and reported in Jeffrey's 
		book, have no significance and appear in the biblical texts by chance, 
		as they also do in any other texts. Jeffrey's fascination with the 
		alleged &quot;phenomenal features&quot; is just one more proof of the 
		unreliability of his statements and of his lack of sufficient knowledge 
		and understanding of the subject he so brazenly chooses to discuss.</p>
		<p>Finally, one more comment on the last two sections. The suggestion of 
		an alleged &quot;code&quot; and of an alleged patterns of sevens could make sense 
		only if the text of the Bible were a precise replica of the original 
		text, letter-by-letter. Obviously realizing that, Jeffrey repeats 
		several times in his book a claim that every letter of the Bible has 
		been preserved precisely since Moses wrote the Torah, as it was 
		dictated, letter by letter, by God. For example, on page 209 Jeffrey 
		wrote: &quot;Jesus Christ, Himself, affirmed that the actual letters 
		composing the Scriptures were directly inspired by God and were 
		preserved in their precise order throughout eternity.&quot; </p>
		<p>While eternity is too long a period of time to experimentally verify 
		Jeffrey's statement, we can do so for a much shorter period, namely for 
		about sixteen centuries.</p>
		<p>There exists a monumental compendium of commentaries and 
		interpretations of the Torah written in the course of several centuries 
		by Jewish &quot;sages.&quot; It is called the Talmud and consists of many books. 
		Jeffrey is obviously not familiar with that source of information. If he 
		were, he would know, for example, of a tractate named <i>Kiddushin</i> 
		which is found in the Talmud. Here is a quotation from that tractate 
		(Kiddushin 30a) written many centuries ago: &quot;The sages of the previous 
		generation were called <i>soferim</i> (meaning 'those who counted') for 
		they counted all the letters in the Torah. Thus they said that <i>Vav</i> 
		in the word <i>Gachon</i> (Leviticus 11:42) is the middle letter of the 
		Torah; the words <i>darosh darash</i> (Leviticus 11.16) are the middle 
		of the words; the verse <i>Vaitgalach</i> (Leviticus 13:33) is the 
		middle of the verses.&quot;</p>
		<p>If though, we look at the Koren edition of the Bible we possess 
		today, we find the following: 1) The middle letter of the Torah is <i>
		Aleph</i> in the word <i>hu</i> (Leviticus 8:78) which is located at a 
		distance of 4829 letters from <i>Vav</i> in the word <i>Gachon</i> which 
		appears only once in the Torah. 2) The middle verse is <i>Vaiten alav et 
		hachoshan</i> (Leviticus 8:8) which is at a distance of 164 verses from
		<i>Vaitgalach</i>. 3) The middle word of the Torah in the Koren edition 
		is <i>achat</i> (Leviticus 8:26) which is at a distance of 743 words 
		from <i>darash darosh</i>. Hence, the text of the Torah as we know it 
		today differs from that known to <i>soferim</i> centuries ago, by 
		hundreds of words and verses and by thousands of letters. Of course, the 
		fact that the text of the Bible underwent many changes in the course of 
		its long existence, has been well known to experts in that matter. This 
		fact alone makes all the suggestions about the ELS code or the pattern 
		of sevens allegedly woven by God into the Bible void of any meaning. 
		Jeffrey, though, is ignorant of this fact as he is of scores of others 
		and arrogantly tries to impose his ignorance on his readers whenever it 
		fits his agenda.</p>
		<h2><a name="arrogance">5. Arrogance of an ignoramus</h2>
		</a>
		<p>I admit that calling a person an ignoramus is not very polite, and I 
		do not enjoy at all the situations in which I have reason to resort to 
		such epithets in regard to anybody even if they are those whose views I 
		reject. Unfortunately, some of Jeffrey's statements are so extremely 
		rude and arrogant that they provide ample justification for refuting his 
		claims in the most blunt form.</p>
		<p>To discuss each and every faulty argument in Jeffrey's book would 
		require writing one more book, and I don't think Jeffrey's opus deserves 
		the time and effort necessary to complete such a detailed refutation of 
		his pseudo-proofs. Therefore in this and in the following sections I 
		will discuss only some selected points in Jeffrey's book, starting with 
		the mentioned rude references by Jeffrey to those who do not share his 
		beliefs. </p>
		<h2>Fools or liars?</h2>
		<p>On page 16 of his book Jeffrey wrote: &quot;Any person who honestly 
		believes that all the marvelous complexity of this universe simply 
		happened by chance is a fool. If he is not a fool, yet still claims to 
		believe that this incredibly complex universe is a result of random 
		chance, then I must conclude that he is not being honest.&quot; </p>
		<p>Let us recall names of some people who, according to Jeffrey, were 
		either fools or liars. </p>
		<p>Albert Einstein. One has only to look at Einstein's &quot;Autobiographical 
		Notes&quot; (in the collection &quot;Albert Einstein, Philosopher-Scientist,&quot; 
		Harper and Bros. New York, 1949, pages 3-5) where Einstein unequivocally 
		calls himself a skeptic. Similar assertions Einstein made elsewhere (for 
		example in his letter of September 28, 1945 to Guy H. Raner Jr, where he 
		said he was an atheist). Niels Bohr. Lev Landau. Bertrand Russel. 
		Stephen Hawking. Many more Nobel price winners, outstanding physicists, 
		mathematicians, chemists, writers, philosophers either did not share 
		Jeffrey's belief that the universe emerged as the result of an action by 
		God or doubted that view and did not adhere to a definite belief in that 
		matter. All these people of great intelligence and integrity, in 
		Jeffrey's view, are either fools or liars. Accounting for the simple 
		fact that Jeffrey himself has no credentials whatsoever in any field of 
		science, or literature, or in any other respect, except for being a 
		prolific preacher, isn't his claim a display of the arrogance of an 
		ignoramus? </p>
		<p>It is always hard to argue with ignoramuses because, lacking the 
		correct knowledge of even the seminal concepts of the subject, they 
		stubbornly adhere to preposterous views. They are usually confident in 
		their views however contrary those views are to the reality hidden from 
		these people by the veil of their ignorance. Many years ago, I knew some 
		illiterate man, a peasant who had a penchant for discussing physics of 
		which he has, to put it mildly, only an approximate knowledge. One of 
		his unshakably held views was that an electric bulb lights up when &quot;a 
		plus and a minus meet.&quot; He pestered me with demands to discuss this and 
		other questions and was very confident that he succeeded in muzzling 
		with his wise arguments. Of course, since his ken in physics was next to 
		zero, I had no way to disabuse him of his ridiculous views. Now, 
		discussing Jeffrey's book, I feel the same frustration facing the 
		impossible task of arguing with somebody who has none of the background 
		necessary for a reasonable discourse, be it the question of probability 
		calculation or any of Jeffrey's alleged proofs which I am going to 
		review. Since Jeffrey is not only largely ignorant of scientific facts, 
		but is also the epitome of self-righteous arrogance, as is obvious from 
		his assertion about &quot;fools or liars,&quot; the task of discussing his book is 
		indeed quite unrewarding.</p>
		<h2><a name="thermo">6. Jeffrey discusses thermodynamics</h2>
		</a>
		<p>Chapter 6 in Jeffrey's book is titled &quot;Scientific Proof that the 
		Bible is Accurate.&quot; In that chapter Jeffrey very convincingly proves 
		that he has no proper understanding of some facts of science. Let us 
		look, for example, at Jeffrey's attempt to enlist thermodynamics as a 
		tool allegedly supporting his beliefs.</p>
		<p>On page 112 we read: &quot;The second Law of Thermodynamics describes the 
		fact that all systems and elements of the universe tend to disintegrate 
		to a lower order of available energy or organization.&quot; A few lines 
		further, Jeffrey continues, &quot;In fact, the second Law of Thermodynamics, 
		the Law of Entropy, absolutely proves that the theory of evolution is 
		nonsense.&quot; Jeffrey bases his assertion on the proposition that evolution 
		means an increase in the complexity of organisms, i.e. the increase in 
		the level of organization, i.e. the decrease of entropy. In Jeffrey's 
		view, this would be contrary to the second law of thermodynamics and 
		that is why, in his view, the evolution theory is nonsense.</p>
		<p>Of course, we already know that, in Jeffrey's view, everybody who 
		disagrees with his beliefs is a fool, and that professors of mathematics 
		at Harvard are half-wits incapable of &quot;constructing a sentence&quot; with a 
		certain mathematical structure. From the quoted sentence we see that 
		Jeffrey's opinion of physicists and biologists is also not very high. 
		Indeed, if we believe Jeffrey's assertions about the laws of 
		thermodynamics, physicists do not understand these laws since they 
		interpret them rather differently from Jeffrey. Likewise, the many 
		biologists who support some version of the evolution theory, must be 
		dunderheads as well as they do not realize that their view is an obvious 
		nonsense.</p>
		<p>In fact, Jeffrey's assertions are nonsense, both in regard to the 
		laws of thermodynamics and to their implications for the evolution 
		theory.</p>
		<p>Let us see how Jeffrey interprets the second law of thermodynamics. 
		When explaining that law, Jeffrey shows that he has not grasped a very 
		important element thereof. The second law of thermodynamics maintains 
		that spontaneous processes in <i>closed macroscopic systems </i>are 
		accompanied by the increase of entropy, i.e. by an increase in the 
		degree of disorder. A crucial part of that law is in the words I printed 
		in italics. While the word &quot;macroscopic&quot; is important, it has little 
		bearing on Jeffrey's misinterpretation of the law in question. However, 
		the word &quot;closed&quot; is quite germane for this discussion. Contrary to 
		Jeffrey's assertion, the second law of thermodynamics does not say that 
		&quot;all systems and elements of the universe&quot; tend to move toward a larger 
		entropy (i.e. larger disorder) but only &quot;closed systems.&quot; By a &quot;closed 
		system&quot; thermodynamics means a system which does not exchange matter and 
		energy with the surrounding. Living organisms are by no means closed 
		systems. They are homeostatic systems (i.e. they tend and largely 
		succeed to automatically maintain certain ranges of temperature and 
		composition) but they continually exchange matter (food and excrement) 
		and energy (heat and work) with their surroundings. Actually each normal 
		(not sick) living organism, be it a plant, animal, or human being, 
		continually and largely successfully resists the increase of its 
		entropy. If Jeffrey's interpretation of the second law were true, not 
		just evolution, but the very existence of living organisms would be 
		impossible. Each time a child is conceived, a process starts, which 
		culminates in the child's birth and in which the entropy of the fetus, 
		and with it of the mother's body as a whole, continually decreases. Does 
		this process contradict the second law of thermodynamics? If we believed 
		Jeffrey, the answer would be &quot;Yes.&quot; The correct answer, though, is &quot;No.&quot; 
		The fetus as well as the mother's body are not &quot;closed systems.&quot; The 
		entropy of a system which is not closed can very well decrease or stay 
		constant and this will not contradict in the least any laws of 
		thermodynamics. What the second law also means, is that if we choose to 
		extend the boundaries of the system to make them envelope some part of 
		the surroundings, then, if the size of the expanded system is chosen to 
		be sufficiently large, the entropy of the expanded system will indeed 
		increase while the entropy of the originally chosen smaller system 
		decreases or stays constant. Life, among other things, is a process in 
		which the entropy of a system fluctuates about certain more or less 
		permanent level, while accompanied by the increase of the entropy of the 
		surroundings, and with it of the universe as a whole.</p>
		<p>Without discussing here the merits or shortcomings of the evolution 
		theory, we can state that it is fully compatible with the second law of 
		thermodynamics, whereas Jeffrey's interpretation is just a display of 
		his illiteracy in physics.</p>
		<p>(I will not discuss here Jeffrey's attempts to use the first law of 
		thermodynamics to support his views, not because it is any better than 
		his treatment of the second law, but just to avoid an excessively 
		detailed discussion). </p>
		<p>Here is one more, small example of Jeffrey's persistent attempts to 
		interpret every vague reference in the Bible in a way favorable to his 
		beliefs. On page 114 Jeffrey asserts that the prophet Isaiah knew that 
		the earth is a sphere. He cites Isaiah as follows; &quot;It is he who sitteth 
		upon the circle of the earth...&quot; etc. In Jeffrey's view, this quotation 
		reveals the prophet's miraculous knowledge &quot;that was far in advance of 
		what the men in that day knew.&quot; Jeffrey seems not to know the 
		distinction between a circle and a sphere. Every kid, standing in an 
		open field or sitting in a boat away from the shore, and looking around, 
		can assert that the horizon circles around his/her position, but this by 
		no means indicates the spherical shape of the planet which, just on the 
		basis of what is observed, very well can be assumed to be a flat 
		circular (or oval) disk. On the other hand, the idea of the spherical 
		earth was by no means unknown to ancient philosophers, who observed the 
		gradual appearance of approaching ships over the horizon, or the 
		circular shadow of the earth during the moon eclipses, or the visible 
		spherical shape of the moon so the idea of a spherical earth could 
		easily be assumed without any miraculous source of knowledge.</p>
		<p>The examples of Jeffrey's misinterpretations of scientific facts, 
		erroneous statements and unsubstantiated attempts to interpret this or 
		that quotation from the Bible as allegedly confirming his beliefs, can 
		be multiplied, but those few examples discussed above provide enough 
		material to realize how dismayingly unfounded are his efforts to 
		convince the readers of his beliefs.</p>
		<h2><a name="prob">7. Jeffrey calculates probabilities</h2>
		</a>
		<p>I have mentioned a couple of times in the preceding sections that 
		Jeffrey's overall ignorance of science is, among other things, evident 
		from his handling of probabilities. The proper calculation and 
		interpretation of probabilities has been discussed in another paper on 
		this web site (see
		<a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/probabilities.cfm">
		Improbable probabilities</a>). From that article, it must become clear 
		that Jeffrey's understanding of the probability theory does not extend 
		beyond some popular explanations. For the sake of simplification, these 
		sources explain the concept of probability inadequately, grossly 
		underestimating the underwater stones one encounters when dealing with 
		probabilities.</p>
		<p>With a typical self-confidence of an ignoramus, Jeffrey did not shy 
		away from trying to <i>teach </i>probability to the readers whom he 
		apparently expected to be even less familiar with the subject than he is 
		himself. His explanation of the multiplication of probabilities and of 
		the odds encountered when estimating a probability of an event that 
		combines several consecutive tests (pages 171-172) does not go beyond 
		the most rudimentary understanding of that complex quantity. Since, 
		however, this question has been elucidated in detail in the mentioned 
		separate paper, in this section I intend to discuss not how he 
		calculates the probability but rather to show how awkwardly he tries to 
		use the probability concept to support his assertion that the Bible 
		contains numerous predictions of future events and that these 
		predictions have been precisely fulfilled.</p>
		<p>On page 170 Jeffrey wrote that &quot;the Old Testament contains over three 
		hundred passages that refer to the coming of the Messiah.&quot; He continues 
		asserting that among those passages, forty-eight allegedly provide 
		&quot;specific details about the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.&quot; Then 
		Jeffrey quoted some of those alleged predictions, insisted that they all 
		came true, and calculated the alleged probability that those predicted 
		events could have happened by chance. Of course, the probabilities he 
		calculated turned out to be extremely small. Hence, concludes Jeffrey 
		triumphantly, the Bible has precisely predicted future events and 
		therefore it must be God's word.</p>
		<p>I will not discuss Jeffrey's calculations <i>per se</i>. Instead, let 
		us look at the alleged &quot;predictions&quot; related to Jesus.</p>
		<p>The simple fact is that none of those &quot;predictions&quot; mentions the name 
		of Jesus of Nazareth. Interpreting the quotations in question as related 
		to Jesus is a completely arbitrary choice by Jeffrey and other defenders 
		of the concept in question. Jeffrey seems to be impressed by the <i>
		wording</i> of those passages in the Old Testament that in his view 
		relate to Jesus because it is quite similar to the <i>wording</i> of 
		some verses describing the life and death of Jesus in the New Testament. 
		Is that surprising in any way? Obviously, the authors of the New 
		Testament were well versed in the Old Testament and used to quoting it. 
		They borrowed many expressions from it in their writing, even when they 
		were not using it to prove the truthfulness of their contention that the 
		coming of Jesus was predicted in the Old Testament. Since, though, they 
		actually had such an agenda, it was even more natural for them to 
		utilize the expressions from the Old Testament to show that this or that 
		event was a fulfillment of a prediction delivered through a prophet.</p>
		<p>Most of the Old Testament's passages in question can be interpreted 
		in various ways, and there is no evidence whatsoever that they imply 
		Jesus of Nazareth. Let us review a few examples.</p>
		<p>On page 172, Jeffrey quotes from the book of Genesis 49:10 as 
		follows: &quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from 
		between his feet, until Shiloah comes; and to him shall be the obedience 
		of the people.&quot;</p>
		<p>Then Jeffrey quotes from the New Testament (Matthew 2:1) as follows: 
		&quot;Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of the Herod 
		the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.&quot; To view the 
		latter quotation as the fulfillment of the prediction in Genesis 49:10 
		requires a lot of imagination. Jeffrey estimated that the fulfillment of 
		the said &quot;prediction&quot; had the probability of 1 in 2,400. Even if this 
		estimate were mathematically correct (which it is not by any stretch of 
		the imagination see the essay on probabilities) it is meaningless 
		because there is no evident connection between the quotation from 
		Genesis and that from Matthew. What has the quotation about a lawgiver 
		from Judah to whom will be the obedience of the people in common with 
		the quotation about wise men coming to Jerusalem after Jesus was born in 
		Bethlehem? There is no reason whatsoever to assume that the lawgiver 
		from Judah was meant to be Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
		<p>On page 173 Jeffrey quotes another passage from the Old Testament 
		(Isaiah 40:3) as follows: &quot;The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 
		'Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert the highway 
		for our God'.&quot; The quotation from Matthew 3:1.2 which, in Jeffrey's 
		view, signifies the fulfillment of the prediction in Isaiah 40:3, is as 
		follows: &quot;In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the 
		wilderness of Judea, and saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is 
		at hand.&quot; Again, Jeffrey performs a meaningless calculation of the 
		alleged probability that the appearance of John the Baptist (which 
		actually does not meet the definition of a random event) could be 
		predicted by chance, as one in 20, not realizing that for an event which 
		is not random the probability has no meaningful interpretation. Again, 
		even if the calculation had a meaning, there is absolutely no reason to 
		connect the above passage from Isaiah with that from Matthew. The only 
		one common point in the two passages is the use of the word 
		&quot;wilderness.&quot; Is that a sufficient reason to assert that Isaiah meant 
		John the Baptist?</p>
		<p>In his next example, Jeffrey calculates the probability (in his 
		estimate, one in 50) that Jesus' coming to Jerusalem <i>on a donkey</i> 
		could be predicted by chance. His quotation from Zechariah 9:9 says: 
		&quot;...King is coming to you; he is just and having salvation, lowly and 
		riding on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey.&quot; Then Jeffrey provides 
		a quotation from Luke 19:35 which describes how Jesus came to Jerusalem
		<i>riding on a colt.</i> Is this really a proof of a fulfilled 
		prediction? Zechariah spoke about some unnamed king. There is no reason 
		whatsoever to assume he meant Jesus. In another place in his book (pages 
		250-253) Jeffrey devotes a whole section to the discussion why the 
		ancient Israelis used no horses. What then is unusual in that particular 
		prediction by Zechariah that whichever king he had in mind would ride 
		into Jerusalem on a donkey? Of course, the probability of 1 in 50 is 
		itself absolutely arbitrary in this case as well.</p>
		<p>I rest my case now, without reviewing the rest of Jeffrey's claims of 
		allegedly fulfilled predictions none of which are better substantiated 
		than the three quoted above. All of them are actually arbitrary 
		interpretations of quotations without any factual basis, accompanied by 
		a meaningless calculation of probabilities of events which were not 
		random. </p>
		<h2><a name="population">8. Jeffrey counts the population of the earth</h2>
		</a>
		<p>On pages 125 through 127 of Jeffrey's book we find a section titled 
		&quot;The Population of the Earth.&quot;</p>
		<p>Let us quote from page 125: &quot;Obviously, a huge discrepancy exists 
		between the evolutionists' suggestion of man's origin approximately one 
		million years ago compared to the Bible's declaration of man's creation 
		by God approximately six thousand years ago.&quot; Indeed, the discrepancy is 
		huge, and that statement is one of the very few correct statements in 
		Jeffrey's book. However, even this, generally correct, assertion 
		requires amendments. First, the conclusion that man appeared on the 
		earth roughly one million years ago is not a consequence of an 
		evolutionary theory. This conclusion is based on archeological data. 
		Therefore it is not a &quot;suggestion by evolutionists,&quot; but a scientific 
		theory supported by a large body of evidence. Of course, the biblical 
		story about the creation of man about six thousand years ago is indeed a 
		&quot;suggestion&quot; lacking any evidence besides the assertion in the Bible 
		itself.</p>
		<p>To support his belief in the inerrancy of the biblical story, Jeffrey 
		offers demographic calculations. He suggests to start his calculations 
		assuming that the entire present population of the earth consists of 
		descendants of just one couple of survivors of the Flood. The latter, 
		according to Jeffrey's suggestion, took place some forty-three hundred 
		years ago. Since, according to the Bible, there were eight survivors, 
		i.e. four couples after the Flood, Jeffrey presents his account for only 
		one rather than for four couples as a manifestation of his impartiality. 
		His next assumption is that every family throughout history produced on 
		the average 2.5 children. Again, since, in his view, the actual rate of 
		growth was larger, this conservative assumption proves his impartiality. 
		Finally, Jeffrey suggests that the average lifespan of a generation was 
		forty-three years, again a very conservative estimation. Then the number 
		of generations. between the time of the Flood and today is estimated as 
		one hundred. Based on these three estimates  one original couple, 2.5 
		children per couple, and one hundred generations - Jeffrey calculated 
		that the population of the earth today must have reached about five 
		billion. In Jeffrey's opinion, &quot;it is fascinating that the earth's 
		population today is almost identical with what we would expect if 
		mankind began repopulating the earth after the Flood forty-three hundred 
		years ago.&quot; What a triumph for the believers in the Bible's story!</p>
		<p>On the other hand, if man existed for about one million years, says 
		Jeffrey, then we would have to account for 23,256 consecutive 
		generations. Repeating the calculation based on the same assumptions as 
		used for the biblical account, we would arrive at an enormous number of 
		people that must live on the earth today, namely ten to the power of 
		2091.</p>
		<p>Of course, these numbers can only cause laughter among experts in 
		demographics. </p>
		<p>Jeffrey does not tell the readers how exactly he calculated the 
		number - about 5 billion  of people living today. However, his 
		assumptions  only one couple starting the proliferation after the 
		Flood, one hundred generations after the Flood, the lifespan of 
		forty-three years per generation and 2.5 children per couple  enable us 
		to figure it out. If every forty-three years every 2 people were 
		replaced, on the average, by 2.5 people, then every forty-three years 
		the population of the earth increased 2.5/2=1.25 times (i.e. by 25%). 
		Then the total of one hundred generations must result in the increase of 
		the population by 4.9 billion times (i.e. 1.25 to the power of one 
		hundred). Apparently, that is how Jeffrey came up with the quoted number 
		of roughly five billion people.</p>
		<p>The above calculation shows why Jeffrey arbitrarily chose to account 
		for only one couple of Flood survivors rather than for all the four 
		couples of the biblical account, and why he arbitrarily chose the 
		lifespan of a generation to be forty-three years. It was contrived <i>a 
		posteriori</i> to get the desired number  about five billion people 
		living today. In doing that, Jeffrey conveniently forgot to multiply his 
		number by 2, the initial number of the Flood survivors he chose to 
		account for. If he did multiply, his number would not be about 5 but 
		about 10 billion, i.e. almost twice the actual population of our planet 
		today. If, though, he had accounted for Shem, Ham and Japheth with their 
		wives, rather than for only one surviving couple, he would have arrived 
		at about thirty billion instead of five billion.</p>
		<p>However, the actual absurdity of Jeffrey's calculation is much worse, 
		as it can be seen if we try to apply his method of calculation to some 
		other situations.</p>
		<p>Here are some examples. Jeffrey professed his unshakable belief in 
		the biblical story. According to that story, when the Jews escaped from 
		slavery in Egypt, the Jewish nation consisted of 600,000 men, plus an 
		unknown number of women and children. If we assume that the number of 
		women was roughly equal to that of men, and that each couple, by a very 
		conservative estimate, had at least one child, the total number of Jews 
		fleeing Egypt must have been at least about 1.5 million people (some 
		rabbinical sources estimate that number to be closer to 2.5 million, but 
		let us choose a more conservative estimate). If that number is correct, 
		a natural assumption is that the total population of Egypt was at least 
		several million. Indeed, archeological data indicate that about 3,300 
		years ago, when the exodus of the Jews supposedly occurred, the 
		population of Egypt was about 2.5 million people. Of course, besides 
		Egypt, there were other countries, so the total population of the earth 
		must have been, at that time, many millions.</p>
		<p>Let us see if any of the two numbers  either 1.5 million of Jews or 
		2.5 million of Egyptians living at the time of the alleged exodus, can 
		be reconciled with Jeffrey's calculations.</p>
		<p>The exodus, according to the Torah's chronology, took place about 
		3,300 years ago. Then the time interval between the Flood and the 
		exodus, according to the biblical story, was about 1,000 years. If the 
		lifespan of a generation, according to Jeffrey's assumption, was 43 
		years, then the number of generations that lived between the Flood and 
		the exodus must have been 1000/43, which rounds up to 23. If the 
		proliferation after the Flood started with only three couples (Shem, Ham 
		and Japheth with their wives) the population of the earth at the time of 
		Exodus, according to Jeffrey's calculations, must have been &quot;6 times 
		1.25 to the power of 23,&quot; which is only about 1,016 people, rather than 
		millions! Yes, Mr. Jeffrey, your calculation is hopelessly at odds with 
		the very biblical data you so firmly believe in.</p>
		<p>Now look at the time that elapsed after the exodus. Let us estimate 
		only the population of Egypt, which, as we have mentioned before, was, 
		some 3,300 years ago, roughly 2.5 million people. During the about 3,300 
		years that elapsed since the alleged exodus, the number of generations, 
		each living for 43 years, as per Jeffrey's assumptions, must have been 
		3300/43 which rounds up to 77. Then the population of Egypt in our time, 
		if we apply Jeffrey's calculation, must have become &quot;2.5 million, times 
		1.25 to the power of 77,&quot; yielding over 72 trillion (72,000,000,000,000) 
		people. Even if we account for possible migration of people from and to 
		Egypt, the absurdity of that number is too obvious.</p>
		<p>Hence, whatever way we analyze Jeffrey's estimation of the population 
		growth, we find that his approach yields absurd numbers. For relatively 
		short periods of time, Jeffrey's calculation yields unreasonably low 
		numbers, while for long periods of time it yields absurdly large 
		numbers.</p>
		<p>In particular, if we discuss the population growth <i>over</i> <i>the 
		course of millennia</i>, we have to remember that wars, famine, 
		diseases, greatly impeded population growth. Just a few hundred years 
		ago, half of the Europe's population perished in the course of a few 
		years because of the plague. How many times did similar epidemics happen 
		at the dawn of human history?</p>
		<p>The actual rate of population increase over millennia was of course 
		much-much lower than Jeffrey's calculation suggests. Moreover, because 
		of the much lower rate of the population growth, not only the number of 
		people living today, but also the total number of people who have ever 
		lived is much less than Jeffrey's estimate implies. Contrary to 
		Jeffrey's assertion, the &quot;trillions of skeletons&quot; are not &quot;predicted by 
		the theory of the evolutionary scientists.&quot;</p>
		<p>The archeological data unequivocally show that man existed long 
		before that day about six thousand years ago when, according to the 
		Bible, the first man was created out of dust. Even on the remote islands 
		of the Pacific, populated later than the continents, a human society 
		already existed about 30,000 years ago.</p>
		<p>Of course, Jeffrey offers no arguments whatsoever which would refute 
		the archeological evidence.</p>
		<h2><a name="new">9. Jeffrey confirms the New Testament's account</h2>
		</a>
		<p>Chapter 5 in Jeffrey's book is titled &quot;The Historical Evidence About 
		Jesus Christ.&quot; Since we already are familiar, from the preceding 
		sections, with Jeffrey's handling of facts, we can expect distortions, 
		misrepresentations and misinterpretations to abound also in this 
		chapter. Indeed, that is what we find in Chapter 5.</p>
		<p>Rather than to discuss at length all alleged proofs of the 
		authenticity of the Gospels offered by Jeffrey, which would require many 
		pages of discussion, let us concentrate only on a few examples of 
		Jeffrey's discourse which are typical of his treatment of facts.</p>
		<p>a) On page 91 we see a section titled &quot;Evidence about Jesus from 
		Flavius Josephus.&quot; Flavius Josephus, whose original name was Yoseph Ben 
		Mattatiahu, was at one time a commander of Jewish warriors who defended 
		the fortress of Yotapata in the Galilee against the onslaught of Romans 
		under the command of the future Emperor of Rome Vespasian. When the 
		fortress fell to the Romans, Yoseph surrendered to the Romans and later 
		became a Roman citizen of high stature. He wrote several books, some of 
		which, including &quot;Antiquities of the Jews,&quot; survived until our time. He 
		was writing that book some sixty years after the supposed death of Jesus 
		of Nazareth. Josephus Flavius was born in AD 37, i.e. several years 
		after the date (about AD 33) assumed as that of Jesus' crucifixion. He 
		could not have witnessed the events described in the four Gospels if 
		these events indeed occurred in the first three decades of the first 
		century. All Josephus could do was to repeat a story he heard from 
		someone else. Possibly, he had access to the sacred texts of what he 
		called the &quot;Christian tribe,&quot; since in his time a Christian community 
		existed in Rome. Therefore, the passage in Josephus's book telling the 
		story about Jesus has none of evidentiary value as a testimony by a 
		witness would. Moreover, some details of that story have caused 
		suspicion that the passage in question is a later insertion by some 
		Christian scribe in order to create a forged testimony by a supposedly 
		unbiased historian. Josephus himself was a Jewish priest, an observant 
		Jew who would not view Jesus as Son of God and the Messiah. This is 
		evident, in particular, from another book by Josephus, &quot;Against Apion,&quot; 
		which was probably the first book ever to denounce anti-Semitism and 
		defend Judaism. Therefore the passage in question sounds quite out of 
		line with Josephus' style and attitude. In the passage in question, 
		Jesus is referred to as &quot;Christ.&quot; It is hard to imagine that, 
		characterizing Jesus, Josephus Flavius, who was fluent in Greek, would 
		use the word &quot;Christ&quot; which is the Greek word for Messiah. He also knew 
		very well that it was unthinkable for Jewish elders and priests to 
		suggest to a Roman governor to condemn a Jew to the cross. Being well 
		aware of Jewish customs and religion, which, among other things, forbade 
		transferring a Jew for trial to Gentiles (especially during the holiday 
		of Passover!) and for whom the crucifixion was anyway an abomination, 
		Josephus Flavius would hardly accept the story about Jesus at face value 
		and repeat it without comments. These considerations give weight to the 
		suggestion that the passage in question is a later insert by some 
		Christian forger. However, even if Josephus had indeed written the 
		passage in question, it has no evidentiary significance being just 
		hearsay, a story he obtained from some other, unknown source.</p>
		<p>b) Other references by Jeffrey to various non-Christian sources 
		(Suetonius, Pliny the Younger, Lucian of Samosata, Cornelius Tacitus) 
		are no more convincing than that with Josephus Flavius. They boil down 
		to repeating some limited information about the activities of early 
		Christians, with vague references to the founder of their &quot;cult&quot; of whom 
		none of the quoted authors had any first-hand knowledge. All of them 
		simply repeated the story they heard about those early Christians and 
		about the alleged founder of their creed.</p>
		<p>All other references by Jeffrey are of the same quality: vague 
		stories about John the Baptist and James, brother of Jesus, which the 
		quoted authors heard from someone else and of which they had no personal 
		knowledge.</p>
		<p>c) One of the most preposterous (and actually mendacious) claims by 
		Jeffrey is found on pages 97 through 105. Here Jeffrey refers to the 
		famous Dead Sea scrolls and claims that in these scrolls there are 
		proofs of the Gospel's authenticity. This claim is absolutely 
		unsubstantiated. The Dead Sea scrolls comprise hundreds of fragments of 
		various manuscripts of which many originated at the time of Jesus' 
		supposed life and death. There are amongst the scrolls parts of all 
		books of the Old Testament except for the book of Esther (but not a 
		single fragment which could be proven to be a segment of the New 
		Testament) and multiple documents of that time, both of civic and 
		religious contents. The fact, quite damaging to Jeffrey's beliefs, is 
		that there is not a single word about Jesus of Nazareth, or Jesus born 
		in Bethlehem, or Jesus son of Joseph and Mary, or any Jesus (<i>Yeshua</i>), 
		in any of the Dead Sea scrolls. All of Jeffrey's unfounded attempts to 
		connect this or that fragment of the Dead Sea scrolls with Jesus, the 
		alleged founder of Christianity, are without merit and border on a 
		deliberate distortion of facts. Of course, Jeffrey could say that the 
		absence of proof is not a proof of absence and I would agree with such a 
		statement. Unfortunately, Jeffrey chose another way, to twist the 
		meaning of certain quotations from the scrolls in question in order to 
		support his beliefs. Let us review a couple of examples.</p>
		<p>On page 99 Jeffrey wrote: &quot;In 1991 the world was astonished to hear 
		that one of the unpublished scrolls included incredible references to a 
		&quot;Messiah&quot; who suffered crucifixion for the sins of men.&quot; According to 
		Jeffrey, the &quot;scroll also describes the Messiah as a 'leader of the 
		community' who was 'put to death.'&quot; The fragment of a scroll in 
		question, the total of only five lines, is believed to have been written 
		by an Essene scribe. It actually refers to Isaiah but makes no mention 
		of Jesus or anybody from Nazareth, or anybody born in Bethlehem or 
		anybody crucified in Jerusalem about AD 33, and, contrary to Jeffrey's 
		assertion, has no features whatsoever which would be common with any 
		part of the New Testament except for the mention that the Messiah was a 
		&quot;shoot of Jesse.&quot; The latter reference is of no special meaning in 
		regard to Jesus because it was established tradition in Judaism that the 
		Messiah would come from the descendants of King David (whose father's 
		name was, in its English rendition, Jesse). Likewise, the reference in 
		that scroll to the Messiah's hands and feet being pierced does not mean 
		anything because such treatment of condemned men was quite usual for the 
		Romans at that time. Thousands and thousands of Jews were crucified by 
		the Romans and the hands and feet of the victims were routinely broken 
		and pierced. Jeffrey's statement that &quot;this scroll confirms the 
		historical truthfulness of the New Testament record about Jesus and His 
		crucifixion&quot; is just an attempt to put a favorable spin on something 
		which actually has no bearing on his thesis.</p>
		<p>On page 101 Jeffrey tells about another &quot;fascinating discovery&quot; of a 
		scroll mentioning The Son of God. Again, this scroll, reflecting the 
		beliefs of an unknown scribe, makes no reference whatsoever to the Jesus 
		of the Gospels. Jeffrey finds similarity between the wording in that 
		scroll and some phrases in Luke 1:32 and 35. Such similarity is not 
		surprising at all. Luke, who, according to the Christian tradition, was 
		a physician, must have been an educated man well familiar with the ways 
		of expression in his contemporary writings, sermons, and discussions of 
		religious questions. It was only natural that some phrases in his 
		writing were similar in style and vocabulary to creations of other 
		writers of that time. To conclude from the above similarity of style 
		that the scroll in question confirms the Gospel's tale seems to be a 
		rather far-fetched proposition.</p>
		<p>The story told in the four Gospels supposedly refers to events of 
		pivotal importance in the history of civilization. Hundreds of 
		manuscripts, originated at the time of the events described in the 
		Gospels, both known before the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls and 
		those found starting in 1947 in the caves at the Dead Sea, never mention 
		the name of the supposed central figure of those events and make no 
		obvious reference to him or to his life and death. This fact, while not 
		necessarily proving that the Gospel's story is fiction, nevertheless 
		provides a strong argument to the opponents of the Gospels' 
		truthfulness. Jeffrey's assertions to the contrary are utterly unfounded 
		and cannot be accepted seriously.</p>
		<p>The rest of Jeffrey's examples are of the same type. He quotes some 
		words from a scroll which have no signs of being related to Jesus, and 
		without any factual basis for it, asserts that the writer of the scroll 
		meant something confirming Jeffrey's beliefs. Reviewing that part of 
		Jeffrey's book amply illustrates the lack of real proofs at his disposal 
		and his desperate determination to create alleged proofs from whatever 
		material is at hand. It would be funny if it were not sad that such a 
		farrago of unsubstantiated claims and obvious distortions becomes a best 
		seller and excites those readers who have no sufficient educational 
		background to see through Jeffrey's skullduggeries.</p>
		<p>d) Jeffrey must be given credit for his attitude towards Jews, since, 
		unlike some of his fellow Christians, he has no anti-Semitic trends in 
		his book. On the contrary, Jeffrey has some kind words in regard to 
		Jewish people, as, for example, on page 34: &quot;Jewish people are known for 
		their brilliance and their willingness to debate at great length any 
		issue involving their religion and history.&quot; Throughout his book, 
		Jeffrey makes numerous references to Jewish sources, whenever they, in 
		his view, confirm his beliefs, asserting the reliability of those 
		sources. However, readers would search in his book in vain for any 
		discussion of the question why the people known for their brilliance 
		refused to share his beliefs in the divine origin and mission of Jesus. 
		Jeffrey could find the explanation of the Jewish view of Jesus in a 
		multitude of Jewish sources. It would force him to argue against those 
		same brilliant people who, as he asserts, provided, to his delight, 
		numerous proofs of the validity of the Old Testament but, on the other 
		hand, expressed a variety of historical, religious and simply logical 
		arguments against the veracity of the Gospels.</p>
		<p>This is just one more example of Jeffrey's selective approach to the 
		arguments related to his agenda. </p>
		<h2><a name="influence">10. Influence of Jesus as a proof of Jeffrey's 
		beliefs</h2>
		</a>
		<p>On page 96 Jeffrey quoted approvingly from a book by Philip Schlaff &quot;<i>The 
		Person of Christ</i>,&quot; as follows: &quot;This Jesus of Nazareth, without 
		money and arms, conquered more millions than Alexander, Caesar, Mohammed 
		and Napoleon.... Without writing a single line, He set more pens in 
		motion, and furnished themes for more sermons, orations, discussions, 
		learned volumes, works of art, and songs of praise than the whole army 
		of great men of ancient and modern times.&quot;</p>
		<p>Is the above statement true? Except for including the name of 
		Mohammed in it, it is, as long as the immense influence of Christianity 
		on the culture of many nations is meant. It is not true, though, when it 
		implies that such influence is absolutely unique.</p>
		<p>Yes, an enormous body of literature, beautiful sculptures, great 
		paintings and poems, dissertations and historical studies have been 
		inspired by the story of the life and death of a poor and unarmed 
		traveling rabbi from Nazareth, regardless of whether or not it is an 
		actual story or a legend. However, a similar statement equally applies 
		to some other figures, first of all to Mohammed and Buddha. The numbers 
		of people who accept the teachings of each of these two historical 
		figures is about as large as that of the Christians. The scope of 
		literature and art inspired by them is as impressive as that inspired by 
		Christianity. The incomparably beautiful architecture of temples in 
		India, Thailand and Cambodia was inspired by religions having nothing in 
		common with Jesus or Christianity. Such examples can be easily 
		multiplied.</p>
		<p>There are also many examples of the enormous influence of certain 
		persons on scores of other people, differing from Jesus, Mohammed and 
		Buddha only in the scale of that influence. Moreover, there are ample 
		examples of evil personalities who nevertheless had very large 
		followings and became the subjects of art, literature and studies. Of 
		course, the maniacal jester Hitler comes to mind as an example. This man 
		had neither money nor arms when he started his crusade aimed at 
		conquering the world and annihilating Jews, Gypsies, and mentally ill 
		people, while killing in the process also thousands of Poles, Russians, 
		and even scores of his fellow Germans. For twelve years, he succeeded in 
		converting tens of millions of educated, talented and industrious people 
		into a nation of murderers, and only the resounding defeat of his 
		valiantly fighting hordes and the catastrophic destruction of the 
		country caused the awakening of his brainwashed followers.</p>
		<p>Stalin organized a massacre of millions of his fellow citizens but 
		during World War II Russian soldiers fought and died shouting his name.</p>
		<p>Of course, there are many other examples of the absolute power of 
		certain personalities over the life and death of their followers. Pastor 
		Jones led eight hundred of his followers to a senseless suicide. There 
		are known other similar occurrences.</p>
		<p>Despite the difference in scale and motivations between these 
		phenomena, they all have important features in common. A charismatic 
		personality captures the minds and imagination of scores of people who 
		become faithful followers of whatever ideas, conceptions, and ways of 
		life the founder of that particular faith or political views expounds. 
		While the mass psychology underlying such phenomena has not been 
		sufficiently understood, one thing is obvious. Islam, Christianity, 
		Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and other religions contradict each other in 
		many respects. They cannot all be equally true. However, each of those 
		religions has millions of followers. The number of followers of this or 
		that conception or religion and the degree of their devotion to that 
		conception or religion by no means signifies that the tenets of this or 
		that religion or teaching are true. Therefore, Jeffrey's and Schlaff's 
		reference to the immense influence of Christianity on the culture of the 
		Western world, however true and impressive, cannot be viewed as proof of 
		the doctrine of that religion or of the story told in the Gospels.</p>
		<h2><a name="conc">11. Conclusion</h2>
		</a>
		<p>In the preceding sections of this article, I mentioned a couple of 
		times that reviewing all chapters and paragraphs in Jeffrey's book would 
		require a book of about the same size and that therefore I chose to 
		limit my review to selected sections only. It may raise a natural 
		question, of whether or not my selection of items for review was 
		governed by an agenda. In other words, the question may be whether or 
		not the sections omitted in my review deserve praise or at least are to 
		be accepted as a reasonable discourse. My answer to that question is a 
		categorical No. While my choice of items subjected to review was to some 
		extent influenced by my own areas of interest, I can assert that I have 
		read the rest of Jeffrey's book and did not find there a single item I 
		would accept as reasonable. Whatever topic Jeffrey discusses, be it 
		archeological data allegedly confirming the biblical story (pages 69-80) 
		or his explanation of the origin of the circumcision custom 
		(pages155-156) or the many other subjects Jeffrey chose to discuss, it 
		is always replete with exaggerations, imprecision, inaccuracies, direct 
		errors and distortions, all aimed at allegedly proving Jeffrey's 
		professed beliefs.</p>
		<p>Some readers may gain an impression that I am against books 
		discussing the validity of religious claims via rational argumentation. 
		To some extent it is true. It does not mean I am against books 
		discussing religious claims, regardless of their authors' position. What 
		I am against is the attempts to use allegedly rational and/or scientific 
		proofs of the validity of religious beliefs without strictly adhering to 
		facts while twisting scientific theories either because of ignorance or 
		because of deliberate deception by the writers.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, Jeffrey's book in question is an epitome of such a 
		creation by an ignoramus who both has no real understanding of science 
		and distorts the historical evidence at will. More often than not, even 
		when Jeffrey makes some statement which is true in general, it still 
		requires amendments to get rid of some inaccuracy.</p>
		<p>The famous Russian-Jewish physicist Lev Landau, reviewing some 
		dissertation of a young physicist, wrote in his customary blunt and 
		humorous style that the reviewed piece contained many items that were 
		new and interesting. Unfortunately, concluded Landau, everything that 
		was new was not interesting while everything that was interesting was 
		not new. Borrowing from Landau and slightly paraphrasing him, we can 
		state that Jeffrey's book contains many items that are relevant and 
		true. Unfortunately, everything that is relevant is not true, while 
		everything that is true is irrelevant.</li>
