	<font face="Verdana"><br>
	<span style="font-size: 11.0pt">IT is my privilege and honour to speak on 
	behalf of Sheikh Hasina. I have undertaken to represent her with great 
	aforethought and fully aware of the far-reaching importance of her struggle. 
	Like every other human being, Sheikh Hasina is entitled to the protection of 
	her fundamental human rights under international law. But it is obvious that 
	the campaign by the military-backed caretaker government to eliminate her as 
	a political leader has grave consequences not just for her, but also for the 
	future of democracy in Bangladesh. As such, her political persecution 
	through the perversion of justice may be the most significant measure of 
	whether this nation will continue to have free and fair elections, to 
	continue on a historical path of developing a mature democracy through trial 
	and error, or whether Bangladesh will go the way of other countries in the 
	region, where unchecked military rule, political radicalization, and 
	religious violence prevail.<br>
	<br>
	While outstanding local counsel in Bangladesh struggle to protect her rights 
	before national courts, the caretaker government must be reminded that this 
	case also implicates the government’s obligations under long-standing United 
	Nations human rights covenants. It is in this respect that I have assumed 
	the position of international counsel, to ensure that Bangladesh abides by 
	its obligations under international law, to remind the government that its 
	actions are being watched closely by the world community, that it cannot 
	establish a military dictatorship under the cover of an anti-corruption 
	campaign, that it cannot engage in such flagrant abuse of power with 
	impunity.<br>
	<br>
	The conduct of the government over the past several months leaves little 
	doubt that the prosecution of Sheikh Hasina is a thinly masked political 
	trial with no merit whatsoever. Those of you who have followed her case are 
	well aware that when the government first accused her of corruption in April 
	of this year, it was Sheikh Hasina that insisted on returning to Bangladesh 
	to challenge the accusations. You will recall that it was the government 
	that vigorously attempted to prevent her from returning from her travels 
	abroad, threatening to impose heavy penalties on any airline that would dare 
	fly her to Dhaka. And it was only after considerable international pressure 
	that the government relented, allowing her to return. Sheikh Hasina 
	returned, as the Economist wrote, to a “rock star’s welcome”, as tens of 
	thousands of Bangladeshis welcomed her back, a testimony to her overwhelming 
	popularity as a leader, and an indication of why the so-called caretaker 
	government is so intent on eliminating her from the political scene. Surely, 
	Sheikh Hasina’s return is inconsistent with the slanderous image of a 
	corrupt Prime Minister that the government tries to portray.<br>
	<br>
	But it is the government’s case itself that most clearly betrays the 
	merit-less accusations against her, and the lengths to which the police and 
	prosecution have been manipulated to use the judiciary as an instrument of 
	political assassination. I refer here to the accusations of businessman Azam 
	Chowdhury, whose information report forms the basis of the current charges 
	against Sheikh Hasina. It cannot go unnoticed that in his original statement 
	to the police, Mr. Azam did not in any way implicate Sheikh Hasina in his 
	allegations of corruption. He only accused her cousin Sheikh Selim who was 
	the Minister of Health at the relevant time. It was only after Sheikh Selim 
	was arrested, detained, and interrogated under questionable circumstances, 
	that a case against Sheikh Hasina could be made. The sole evidence is Sheikh 
	Selim’s supposed “confession” that he approached Sheikh Hasina concerning 
	illicit payments, and that she advised him that those payments should go to 
	her sister Sheikh Rehana. Now what were the circumstances that led to such 
	an incredulous admission by Sheikh Selim? There are credible indications 
	that while in custody, he was subjected to serious physical and mental 
	abuse. His interrogators reportedly threatened that if he did not 
	collaborate with them, his family would “die a slow, painful death”.<br>
	<br>
	Should there be any doubt about the veracity of such allegations of torture, 
	should I be accused of hyperbole in advocating Sheikh Hasina’s case, I draw 
	your attention to the August 1st letter that Human Rights Watch submitted to 
	Mr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Chief Advisor of the caretaker government of 
	Bangladesh. In this letter, coming from one of the most distinguished human 
	rights organizations in the world, Mr. Fakhruddin is advised that: “Serious 
	and systemic human rights abuses are taking place on your watch.” In 
	addition to torture and extrajudicial executions, Human Rights Watch 
	notifies the Chief Advisor that “emergency rules that do not respect basic 
	due process rights, or the large number of arbitrary arrests and detention 
	without proper judicial oversight or public accountability, are a direct 
	result of your government’s policies” and that “the rule of law appears to 
	be breaking down under your administration.” The letter goes on to state 
	that “Because the sweeping regulations under the state of emergency now in 
	force do not comply with international requirements and have been misused in 
	practice, we urge you to repeal them immediately.” As indicated by a recent 
	hearing in which the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh 
	granted bail to Sheikh Hasina, the use of the Emergency Power Rules by the 
	government reflects a deliberate policy to deny her basic due process 
	rights. Under the Rules, those accused of corruption may be held without 
	bail. It is regrettable that the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court has 
	stayed the grant of bail following an appeal by the Attorney-General, and 
	that the government has initiated new cases in order to continue Sheikh 
	Hasina’s unlawful and arbitrary detention. It is also telling that she has 
	been given only a few days in which to prepare a Wealth Report under the 
	Emergency Rules, while in prison, without access to her papers or other 
	records, which were all confiscated at the time of her arrest, and without 
	the cooperation of the banks.<br>
	<br>
	Notwithstanding these gross abuses of due process, it is the evidence 
	obtained through the torture of her cousin Sheikh Selim that stands out as 
	the most egregious violation of human rights. Consider the following 
	statement by Human Rights Watch to the government concerning the use of 
	torture in order to obtain “confessions”: “Bangladesh’s military forces have 
	become notorious for taking people into custody, torturing them to death or 
	executing them in faked ‘crossfire killings.’” Indeed, this letter refers to 
	the case of Mr. Tasneem Khalil, a consultant for Human Rights Watch and 
	stringer for CNN, who in May of this year was “taken from his home in front 
	of his wife and child, blindfolded and driven to an interrogation centre, 
	where he was tortured and questioned … Mr. Khalil saw sophisticated torture 
	equipment and could hear other detainees screaming in pain. … Before his 
	release, [he] was forced to make false confession, and asked to sign 
	documents and testify on video admitting to acts that could be considered 
	treasonous.” It is in this dire context that the so-called “confession” of 
	Sheikh Selim has to be assessed, and I will also note that since he is still 
	in detention, the full extent of his mistreatment may be difficult to 
	divulge.<br>
	<br>
	One of the most fundamental human rights norms is the prohibition of 
	torture. This includes the inadmissibility of confessions obtained through 
	torture as evidence in judicial proceedings. The government of Bangladesh 
	must be reminded that the use of torture in the trial of Sheikh Hasina is a 
	particularly serious violation of international law. It is in fact an 
	international crime that the government is under an obligation to prevent 
	and punish under United Nations human rights treaties which it has signed. 
	Torture gives rise to individual criminal responsibility not only of those 
	who perpetrate it, but also of those in positions of authority that 
	legitimize it by failing to prosecute perpetrators. Those that are 
	acquiescing in this travesty of justice against Sheikh Hasina should 
	consider the doctrine of command responsibility, not least in a case with 
	such a high-profile and intense international scrutiny. It was after all in 
	the Pinochet case before the House of Lords in this country that the 
	consequences of tolerating such conduct became apparent for once untouchable 
	Heads of State. The message should be clear for the current leaders of 
	Bangladesh. Instead of prosecuting Sheikh Hasina on trumped up charges of 
	corruption, those responsible for the torture of Sheikh Selim should be put 
	on trial, otherwise those that are condoning such conduct may themselves be 
	in the dock one day.<br>
	<br>
	As part of our initial campaign to hold Bangladesh accountable to its 
	international human rights obligations, we have last week communicated the 
	details of Sheikh Hasina’s case to the Office of the United Nations High 
	Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. In particular, we have sent 
	information to the Special Rapporteur on Torture, Professor Manfred Nowak of 
	Austria, and to the Special Rapporteur on the Independence of the Judiciary, 
	Leandro Despouy of Argentina. We will ensure that the United Nations system, 
	and more widely, the international community, is fully appraised of the 
	legal proceedings against Sheikh Hasina, and hope that the government will 
	appreciate that its human rights violations, its attempt to subvert 
	democracy, will exact a heavy cost. It is especially regrettable that 
	Bangladesh, a nation with a proud tradition of internationalism, a nation 
	whose military have served as United Nations peacekeepers throughout the 
	world, must now become a symbol of a military bent on usurping the power of 
	democratically elected leaders. We are certain that there are those amongst 
	the ranks of the military that realize the grave consequences for Bangladesh 
	of becoming an international pariah, of losing the tremendous hard-won 
	prestige and influence that the armed forces have brought to this nation.<br>
	<br>
	In charting its course of action, the international community must also 
	realize that the laudable goal of fighting corruption cannot be at the 
	expense of human rights. Surely, Bangladesh’s deterioration into a military 
	dictatorship will only increase the abuse of power, will only increase the 
	corruption that comes with the absence of accountability. Democracy and 
	respect for the rule of law is a long and arduous process that is achieved 
	in over time. While Sheikh Hasina herself supported the assumption of power 
	by the caretaker government in January of this year, it was based on the 
	desire for free and fair elections, for an end to the turmoil that had 
	gripped the country, and not for the elimination of democracy. And those 
	that believe that the military-backed government should be given yet more 
	time to prepare for elections now postponed till 2008 should consider how 
	with the most popular political leader in prison, and with rights of 
	assembly and free speech severely curtailed under emergency laws, it is 
	possible to hold free and fair elections. This amounts to denying democracy 
	in the name of attaining democracy. We therefore appeal to the international 
	community to adopt a principled policy that upholds human rights and the 
	rule of law, lest Bangladesh fall prey to the same authoritarian forces that 
	have resulted in a steady deterioration of peace and stability in 
	neighbouring countries.<br>
	<br>
	And most of all, our message to the government of Bangladesh is that we will 
	not allow this travesty of justice to go unchallenged. We will use every 
	means at our disposal to enlist the support of the United Nations, and to 
	expose the trial of Sheikh Hasina for what it is: a military coup 
	masquerading as an anti-corruption campaign. </span></font></p>
