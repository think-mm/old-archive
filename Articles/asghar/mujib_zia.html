                                I was delighted to read Mr. Mohammad Ahsan’s 
                                write up in Mukto-mona, through which he tried 
                                to put the pre-independence history of 
                                Bangladesh in its right and true perspective. 
                                Like many other Bangladeshis, who had heard Sk. 
                                Mujib speak on that historical day of March 7, 
                                1970, I believe that the words he had used in 
                                his that speech amounted to declaring 
                                independence for Bangladesh and that he did have 
                                to issue further declaration, oral or written, 
                                for motivating the people of East Pakistan into 
                                waging their struggle against the armed forces 
                                of Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>

                                &nbsp;I have made the above observation not because I 
                                am a follower of Awami League, or that I have an 
                                agenda of my own to advance through it. Nor am I 
                                trying to glorify the personality of Sk. Mujib 
                                unnecessarily, for I do not possess a 
                                sycophantic mentality. Despite being a critic of 
                                his administrative shortfalls, I respected him 
                                like my father. I always believed that had he 
                                not motivated the Bengalees to fight for the 
                                independence of Bangladesh, I would not have 
                                become in my life what I am today. The 
                                independence of Bangladesh helped me in becoming 
                                a businessman; it enabled me to go around the 
                                world a number of times and also, it gave me 
                                everything that I have today, be it a good life 
                                or the respect and honor I had earned during my 
                                business career in Bangladesh.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
                                Had not Bangladesh become an independent 
                                country, I am pretty sure of what I would have 
                                become: living under the domain of the West 
                                Pakistanis, I would, perhaps, have become a 
                                General Manager of a Bank after serving it until 
                                the end of my life, and that, too, if I had been 
                                successful in keeping my Pakistani bosses 
                                pleased during the entire length of my service.

                                insurance company with some friends, and had a 
                                wonderful life for so long as I and my family

                                from criticizing him on his face, and this 
                                chance came to me in 1974, when I had the 
                                opportunity of seeing him at his Dhanmondi 
                                residence in presence of his younger brother, Sk.

                                Readers might recollect that in 1974, Bangladesh 
                                had faced its first serious food crisis. To help 
                                us out, Japan had agreed to donate 93,000 metric 
                                tons of rice, with the condition that Bangladesh 
                                would have to arrange its transportation at its 
                                own cost. My company was involved for shipping 
                                and transporting the entire quantity of rice to 
                                Chittagong.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
                                &nbsp;Phuni Bhushan Majumder was the Food Minister. 
                                For reasons unknown to me, he was delaying in 
                                the opening of the Letter of Credit for the 
                                freight. Having failed in all my efforts, I 
                                enlisted Sk. Nasir’s help whom I knew from my 
                                days in Khulna. As a good friend, he came down 
                                to Dhaka and asked me to see him at Sheikh’s 
                                Dhanmondi residence in the early morning of a 
                                day.&nbsp;</p>

                                I reached Dhanmondi on schedule, and was taken 
                                immediately to the Sheikh’s private study on the 
                                second floor of the building. While Nasir and I 
                                were hardly seated, the Sheikh arrived, wearing 
                                a lungi and a ganji (vest), with his tobacco 
                                pipe in his hand. He sat down in front of me, 
                                and wanted to know what my problem was. I told 
                                him about the Letter of Credit and the 
                                displeasure the Japanese were having due to the 
                                delay in its opening.</p>

                                He picked up his green phone; asked his

                                was connected, he asked him whether or not he 
                                was having any problem with the opening of the 
                                Letter of Credit. I did not hear what Phuni was 
                                saying, but I still remember what the Sheikh had 
                                told him: Phuni, you know we are in the midst of 
                                a serious food crisis, and yet, you are sitting 
                                on the Letter of Credit. I want you to open it

                                He looked at my face quizzically and then said:

                                doing it to serve their own political and

                                any energy to care about the dispute; they are 
                                too busy with the struggles of their own lives.

                                are distorting the modern history of Bangladesh, 
                                how can we say that the history of religions, as 
                                we read it today, is free from distortions? How 
                                or must we take the stories told about Moses, 
                                Jesus Christ and Muhammad at their face value?

                                straight and genuine responses to the questions 
                                I have asked above. Thanks in anticipation to 
                                those who are willing to help me with their 
                                educated responses. I fervently appeal to the 
                                members of Mukto-mona, Vinnomot and News from 
                                Bangladesh and those who are not their members 
                                not to waste their valuable time on writing 
                                responses, if they know that what they are going 
                                to write are beyond logic, and that they would 
                                not be able to substantiate their responses, 
                                when they are subjected to critical analysis and 
                                arguments.</span></p>
