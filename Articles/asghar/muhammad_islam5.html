  <p align="justify">We have reached, in our narrative, the fifth year of
  Muhammad's mission. From time to time, he did face the pagans' opposition to
  his preaching, but they had never succeeded in shutting him off completely. In
  spite of enjoying an almost unrestricted freedom to engage himself in his
  proselytizing activities, Muhammad, it seems, had not been able to secure more
  than sixty to seventy converts over such a long period of time.<br>
  <br>
  At this stage, we want to digress from our narrative, and visualize what
  stressful days Muhammad must have been passing, after being in his mission for
  five devastating years, in the religiously charged atmosphere of Mecca.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  As we have mentioned earlier in this presentation, it was Khudeija, who, along
  with her cousin, had commissioned Muhammad to found in Mecca a religion that
  was intended to establish the unity of a single God. He had undertaken the
  mission not only for his wife's sake, but also for his own reasons, which we
  have stated earlier, being assured that she was going to put her entire wealth
  at his disposal so that he could use it for achieving their common goal.<br>
  <br>
  For five years, Muhammad lived on his wife's wealth. He also used it to feed
  most of the new Muslims, many among whom were slaves and the downtrodden. A
  good part of her wealth also had to be used as bribes for those pagans who
  were inclined towards Islam, but refrained from converting to it. In short, he
  used his wife's bequeathed wealth for all the purposes he considered necessary
  for achieving what he had set out to achieve five years ago.<br>
  <br>
  But when his resources were almost exhausted, with him taking no part in trade
  activities for a long time to recoup his wife's expanded wealth, he began to
  feel the crunch that invariably follows such a situation. He, therefore, began
  to search for the ways through which he could reduce the pressure on his
  depleting coffer.<br>
  <br>
  To understand what Muhammad might have been thinking to ease pressure over his
  ever-decreasing resource, we need to consider certain conditions that were
  prevailing in the Arabian society at that period of time. We have mentioned
  that Muhammad had initially launched his movement to force the pagans to
  worship a lone Allah. It was followed by his attack on the rich merchants of
  Mecca because of the reason that they prided in their wealth and refused to
  share their privileges with the poor, orphan and the needy. Though the latter
  issue had won him some support from the common folks, yet he could not have
  neglected the crippling effect that it had produced in the lives of the people
  he sought to help. It was in the background of this situation that Muhammad
  had, at one stage, come up with a reconciliatory plan, aimed at appeasing his
  opponents. Not fully realizing the implication of his plan, he announced that
  he accepted the divinity of the &quot;Lord of the House,&quot; whom the pagans
  worshipped in the form of a statue they had installed in the Ka'aba. He
  followed this concession by permitting his followers to worship the idols of
  al-Lat, al-Uzza and al-Manat together with the pagans. They were exuberant,
  thinking that their days of polemics and hardship were over. But their
  happiness did not last long, and they realized it very soon. To the Muslims,
  the last concession is known as &quot;Gharaniq.&quot; According to one Muslim
  writer, it had taken place in Mecca in late 5th or early 6th year of his
  preaching (Dr. Majid Ali Khan, The Holy Verses, pp.32-37).<br>
  <br>
  He had adopted the reconciliatory policies to ease the difficulties of the
  poorer section of the Meccan population so that he could continue to have
  their support. He, however, withdraw the concession, claiming it to have been
  a Satanic act, when he realized that by authorizing the pagans to worship
  their idols, he had retracted his stand on the issue of absolute monotheism,
  thus jeopardized his claim of prophethood as well. To extract himself from the
  alleged faux pas, he put the blame on the Satan, who, he said, had put the
  words of the declaration in his mouth, despite him having had obtained full
  protection from God in order to protect himself from the devil's influence.
  The reversal of his later policy did not bode well with the pagans, and they
  were infuriated. Considering Muhammad's retraction as an act of betrayal, they
  decided to oppose his religion more vigorously. Had Muhammad not had his uncle
  Abu Talib's protection, they might even have caused him bodily harm.<br>
  <br>
  The fiasco and the atmosphere of distrust created by the abrogation of his
  compromising announcements notwithstanding, we must praise Muhammad's sense of
  pragmatism, which he always exhibited in all difficult times. To a great
  extent, this quality of his was responsible for making him, in the long run, a
  successful person.<br>
  <br>
  Encouraged by his pragmatic thoughts, he decided to send a delegation of neo-<br>
  Muslims to Abyssinia in 615 A.D., probably, with the following objectives in
  his mind:<br>
  <br>
  In the last five years, his achievements, if any, were dismal. In the same
  period, he saw the pagan opposition to his cause growing. He also saw his
  resources depleting, with no recourse being available to him to replenish
  them. Although Abu Talib's protection had shielded him from his opponents, but
  he saw many of his followers, who had no social status or protection,
  undergoing physical torture at the hands of their masters, or employers.
  Moreover, he, too, had failed to provide gainful employment to those who had
  forsaken their jobs, and became his disciples.<br>
  <br>
  Consequently, he sensed a suppressed disaffection taking hold of his
  followers. He, therefore, needed to divert their attention to a different
  direction. He also needed to take steps not only to invigorate his followers'
  faith in his leadership, but also to contain his opponents' hostility to his
  cause.<br>
  <br>
  With the stated objectives in mind, Muhammad began to explore possibilities in
  right earnest. While carrying on with his exploration, he came to know much
  about Abyssinia. He learned that a Christian ruled it, and that he was
  tolerant of other religions. He also learned that the Negus harbored an
  ambition on Mecca, and that he was not in favor of the Persians spreading
  their net of influence over the citadel of pagan worship.<br>
  <br>
  In the final analysis, Abyssinia appeared to Muhammad to be a perfect country
  of choice to which he decided to turn for help. Accordingly, he prepared and
  dispatched a delegation of his followers to Abyssinia. It consisted of eleven
  members, including Ruqayyah, his daughter. Uthman, her husband, was appointed
  its leader.<br>
  We assume that Muhammad had charged the leader of the delegation to achieve
  the following objectives:<br>
  <br>
  1. Muhammad was aware that the Abyssinians were eager to regain their lost
  dominion of Arabia; and also that to help their Byzantium allies who had just
  suffered a serious defeat at the hands of the Persians, they were willing to
  listen to any ideas that were likely to divert their enemy's attention.
  Capitalizing on the Abyssinians' focus, the delegation was to convince the
  Negus to attack Mecca and to take over its administration. Other members of
  the delegation had instructions to narrate, in Negus' court, horrible stories
  of how their pagan masters were not only torturing them, but also how they
  were starving them to death. Being convinced, should the Negus take over
  Mecca, he was to choose Muhammad to become its ruler. His ascension to power
  would have helped him in achieving all his objectives easily, and in a shorter
  period of time.<br>
  <br>
  2. Should the Negus refuse to do what Muhammad wished him to do, the leader
  and his wife were to return to Mecca, leaving behind the rest of his
  delegation members in Abyssinia. The &quot;refugees&quot; were expected to
  find jobs among the people who were tolerant towards the people of other
  religions. This latter scheme had a two-fold purpose: Their staying back in
  Abyssinia not only would have made them beyond the reach of their masters'
  torture, it would also have freed Muhammad from the responsibility, which
  required him to meet the demands of their livelihood.<br>
  <br>
  3. Those of his followers, who had mercantile background, were to explore the
  likelihood of developing aggressive business connections with the Abyssinian
  people, which, if materialized, would have greatly undermined the monopolistic
  position of the pagan niggards.<br>
  <br>
  4. The continuous presence of Muhammad's disciples in Abyssinia would have
  created a base there for Muhammad himself. Should he ever had felt unsafe in
  Mecca, he could easily have gone over to Abyssinia and live safely among his
  disciples. From here, he could plot and try to take over Mecca at an opportune
  time in future.<br>
  <br>
  The Meccans suspected what Muhammad wanted to achieve by sending a group of
  his people to Abyssinia. As its result, the Meccans had his mission followed
  by a mission of their own. It was charged with the responsibility of
  countering the Muslim allegations against them and to have them expelled by
  the Negus.<br>
  <br>
  After hearing both the parties, Negus declined the Muslim request of invading
  Mecca, but allowed them to live in his country. The pagans were happy with his
  decision.<br>
  Contrary to what we have stated above, most Muslim writers maintain that the
  Muslims had migrated to Abyssinia only to escape from the persecution of their
  enemies. This, though, is partly true, but not the whole truth. In support of
  our hypothesis, we submit the following:<br>
  <br>
  At the time we are talking about here, there was no police or law enforcing
  agencies in the whole of the Arabian Peninsula. But the lack of these
  agencies, however, did not mean that the nomads and the sedentary Arabs had no
  rules to govern certain aspects of their lives. In fact, they did have rules,
  which regulated their conducts.<br>
  The Arabs had, over a long period of time, developed a system of protection,
  which a particular tribe or clan gave to its members. Without having
  protection, it was impossible for anyone to survive in the harsh environments
  of the desert. This particular system of protection had made it dangerous for
  a man to lay his hands on a member of another tribe or clan. If any member of
  a clan attacked a protected member of another clan, the victim's clan exacted
  vengeance or a blood-wit from the clan of the offending person. This system
  worked well for the Arabs and it helped them keep incidences of death through
  violence under control. It was this clan protection, which his uncle Abu Talib
  made use of, to protect Muhammad from the pagans' physical assault. When his
  uncle died, Muhammad had to obtain the protection of Mutim Ibn Adi, the chief
  of the Nofal clan of Quraish.&nbsp; Without his protection, Muhammad could not
  have survived in Mecca.<br>
  <br>
  Uthman Ibn Affan, who headed the Muslim delegation to Abyssinia, had, and
  enjoyed, the full protection of his clan. It was on account of this fact that
  he was never manhandled or assaulted by his enemies. Moreover, it is claimed
  that he had an independent source of income that supported his as well as his
  family members' lives. When he faced no threat to his life, and had a secured
  means of livelihood at his disposal, what had made him and his wife to migrate
  to Abyssinia must not be a very difficult matter for us to understand. And our
  understanding is: Muhammad had chosen Uthman and his wife to represent him
  before the Negus of Abyssinia, and to try to achieve those tasks, which we
  have mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs of this presentation.<br>
  <br>
  In Mecca, meanwhile, Muhammad continued the propagation of his faith and kept
  on trying to win converts to his faith. The pagans took all peaceful steps to
  deter him from propagating his anti-pagan faith, but they failed to achieve
  their objective.<br>
  <br>
  Frustrated, they passed a decree banishing him, and all who embraced his
  faith. Sensing the ferocity of the impending storm, Muhammad took refuge in
  the house of a disciple named Orkham. His house was situated on the hill of
  Safa. This hill was renowned in Arabian tradition as being the place at which
  Adam and his wife (Quranic reference to Eve who is not mentioned in it by a
  name) lived together, having previously been reunited at the plains of Arafat
  after their long solitary wandering all about the earth, following their
  expulsion from Paradise. It was, likewise, connected in tradition with the
  story of Hagar, Abraham's concubine, and her son Ishmael.<br>
  <br>
  Muhammad remained in his sanctuary for a month, continuing his revelations and
  drawing to him converts from various parts of Arabia. Eventually, the
  Quraishites caught hold of his whereabouts. He had an uncle by the name of
  Amru Ibn Hashim. The Quraishites had given him the name of Abu 'Ihoem, or
  Father of Wisdom, on account of his sagacity. The Muslims had changed it to
  Abu Jahl, Father of Folly, due to his opposition to his nephew, and Islam. The
  later appellation has remained stuck till these days to his name, who is
  seldom mentioned by zealous Muslims without the ejaculation, &quot;May he be
  accursed of Allah!&quot; This uncle sought him out, heaved insults in
  vituperative language, and even tried reportedly to maltreat him physically.
  His outrage was reported to Hamza, another uncle of Muhammad, as he was
  returning from his hunting trip. He was at that time not a Muslim, but was
  pledge-bound to protect his nephew.<br>
  <br>
  Marching, with his bow in his hand, to the place where Abu Jahl was vaunting
  his recent triumph to some of the Quraishites, Hamza dealt him a blow that
  inflicted a grievous wound on his head. After some altercation that followed
  the attack, Hamza declared that he had right then become a Muslim and took the
  oath of adhesion to Muhammad instantaneously, thus greatly boosting the morale
  of his nephew.<br>
  <br>
  Abu Jahl's prestige and esteem injured, he vowed to avenge the perpetrator. He
  had a nephew by the name of Omar Ibn al Khattab. He was twenty-six years of
  age, having a gigantic stature, a prodigious strength, and a great courage. He
  was reportedly so tall that even when seated, he dwarfed those who remained
  standing. Reputed to have been a heavy drinker, he was also known to beat his
  wife habitually. Instigated by his uncle Abu Jahl, this fierce man pledged to
  penetrate Muhammad's hideout and to inflict upon on him or on Hamza the injury
  that the latter had inflicted upon Abu Jahl.<br>
  <br>
  On his way to Orkham's house, in which Hamza along with Muhammad was lodged,
  he met a Quraishite, to whom he disclosed his design. The Quraishite was a
  secret convert to Islam and sought to turn him away from his violent errand.
  He told him to check if anyone from his own family was guilty of heresy,
  before he went and harmed Muhammad or his uncle. Taken aback, he wanted to
  know who among his family members had renounced his ancestral religion. The
  informant gave Omar the names of his sister Amina and her husband Said.<br>
  <br>
  Omar changed his course and hastened to his sister's dwelling. Entering it
  abruptly, it is said, he found his sister and her husband reading the Quran.
  Said attempted to conceal it, but his confusion convinced Omar of the truth of
  the accusation and heightened his fury. In his rage, he struck Said to the
  ground, placed his foot upon his chest, and would have plunged his sword into
  it had not his sister interposed. In his anger, he gave her a blow, which had
  her face bathed in blood.&nbsp; &quot;Enemy of Allah!&quot; sobbed Amina;
  &quot;dost thou strike me thus for believing in the only true Allah? In spite
  of thee and thy violence, I will preserve the true faith. &quot;Yes,&quot; she
  added with fervor, &quot;there is no allah but Allah, and Muhammad is His
  Prophet; and now, Omar, finish thy work!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Repenting his violence, Omar paused and took his foot away from the chest of
  Said. &quot;Show me the writing,&quot; said he. When the parchment containing
  the twentieth Sura or chapter of the Quran was given to him, he read it, and
  it sank into his heart. Moved greatly, especially by the parts, which dealt
  with resurrection and the judgment, he decided to embrace the religion of
  Islam without any delay.<br>
  <br>
  Omar rushed to Orkham's house and, seeing Muhammad, expressed his desire to
  become a Muslim. Muhammad greeted him warmly and conducted him in the Muslim
  profession of faith; i.e. the invocation of Kalima Tayyaba, recitation of
  which completes one's induction into the faith of Islam.<br>
  <br>
  Omar was not content until his conversion was publicly announced. At his
  request, Muhammad accompanied him instantly to the Ka'aba, to perform openly
  the rites of Islam. Omar walked on the left hand and Hamza on the right to
  protect him from injury or insult. It is said that about forty disciples
  accompanied the procession.<br>
  The story about Amina and Said having the Quran written on a parchment, and
  reading from it, is a concoction. In fact, during the time Muhammad was
  preaching Islam, the Arabs did not know that it existed even in Egypt, where
  the Egyptians were known to have extensively used it for preserving their
  writings.<br>
  <br>
  Muslims got the encouragement to fabricate the parchment's story from verse
  6:7 of the Quran. In it, Muhammad hypothesized that even if he had the Quran
  written on a parchment, which the pagans could see and touch, even then they
  would not only have denied its divine nature, they would also have rejected it
  as being &quot;nothing but the obvious magic.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Unable to substantiate the content of the verse, one of the Muslim scholars
  has tried to explain it by claiming, &quot; Qirtas, in the Apostle's life,
  could only mean &quot;parchment,&quot; which was commonly used as writing
  materials in Western Asia from the 2nd century B.C. The word was derived from
  the Greek, Charles (Cf. Latin, &quot;Charla&quot;). Paper, as we know it, made
  from rags, was used by the Arabs after the conquest of Samarqand in 751 A. D.
  The Chinese had used it by the 2nd century B.C. The Arabs introduced it into
  Europe; it was used in Greece in the 11th and 12th century, and in Spain
  through Sicily in the 12th century. The Papyrus, made from an Egyptian reed,
  was used in Egypt as early as 2,500 B.C. It gave place to paper in Egypt in
  the 10th century (Abdullah Yusuf Ali, op.cit. vol.1, p. 290).<br>
  <br>
  Because we hold the scholar's erudition in high esteem, we expected that
  instead of giving us the paper's history, he would tell us how the Arabs came
  to have parchment when they did not have reed, and also, why did they write
  down the revelations on skin, leaves and bones etc., when they, according to
  him, had access to this writing material?<br>
  <br>
  The truth, perhaps, lies somewhere else. We suspect that Muhammad had seen the
  use of parchment in Syria during his business trips to that country, and
  impressed with its usage, he mentioned it to the pagans as a passing remark.
  Or, perhaps, the narrator added the word 'parchment' to the verse at the time
  the Quran was being compiled during Abu Bakr's regime.<br>
  <br>
  Damascus in Syria was a modern city, and its populace highly literate, when
  Abu Bakr conquered it in 634 A. D. The Syrians were believed to have been
  among the first who invented the Arabic alphabets. The narrator of the verse
  must have visited Damascus and seen the use of parchment there. While
  narrating to the ascribe what Muhammad was supposed to have told his disciples
  about the pagan's attitude towards his revelations, he must have added the
  word &quot;parchment&quot; to the verse without realizing the fact that at the
  time Muhammad had made the statement, parchment was not in use among the
  pagans of Mecca.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Hamza and Omar's conversion to the new faith proved to be a milestone in the
  early history of Islam; for now Muhammad had the physical and moral support of
  two of the Quraishites' bravest and most powerful people. This also had
  enabled him to go about his preaching more confidently than ever before.
  Omar's conversion to Islam is said to have caused so much of exasperation
  among the Quraish that Abu Talib, Muhammad's uncle, was forced to conclude
  that the pagans might make an attempt on his nephew's life, either by
  deception or through open violence. Therefore, the old man urged him and some
  of his disciples to withdraw to a house, belonging to him, in the neighborhood
  of the city.<br>
  <br>
  The protection thus given to Muhammad and his followers by Abu Talib, the head
  of the Hashimites, and by others of his line although differing from him in
  faith, drew on them the wrath of the rival branch of the Quraishites. This
  produced a schism that enmeshed the entire tribe. Abu Sofian, the head of the
  rival branch, availed himself of Muhammad's heresies to throw discredit, not
  merely upon such of his kindred as had embraced his faith, but upon the whole
  line of Hashim which - - though dissenting from his doctrines - - had
  protected him through mere clannish feelings. Abu Sofian did not oppose
  Muhammad and his uncle Abu Talib only out of personal hatred or religious
  scruples, but also because of a family feud that related to the guardianship
  of the Ka'aba.<br>
