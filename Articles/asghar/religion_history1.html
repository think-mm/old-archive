                                Ever since Johann Gutenberg revolutionized
                                “movable type” printing press in the middle
                                of 14th century A.D., innumerable writers
                                churned out millions of books, describing
                                therein how religions came to mankind, and who
                                founded them in so many words, and in such
                                sophistical terms as made them almost impossible
                                for most common folks to understand their
                                religions as clearly as they needed to
                                understand them.<br>
                                <br>
                                This trend continues even today, with the result
                                that there is not a single religion in the world
                                that can claim that its followers have been
                                following its dogmas, practices and stipulations
                                in unison and concert, and that there is no
                                disagreements among its followers on the
                                application of its doctrines in their daily
                                lives.<br>
                                <br>
                                Recognizing the fact that people of all walks of
                                life need to know the backgrounds of some of the
                                major religions of the world, I took upon myself
                                the responsibility to write this treatise for
                                their benefit, but as concisely as it is
                                possible.<br>
                                <br>
                                I hope my benign attempt would also help our
                                future generations in understanding the
                                religions they would be growing up with, and be
                                following in their own lives. However, in
                                discussing Islam, I would be a little more
                                elaborative due to the reason that it is the
                                latest religion and also because it is claimed
                                to be the pure and perfect religion of God.<br>
                                <br>
                                We humans are assumed to have evolved around 65
                                millions years ago. This assumption was brought
                                to our attention by Charles Darwin through his
                                book, “The Origin of Species.” He wrote it
                                in 1859.<br>
                                <br>
                                Charles Darwin was a geologist, zoologist,
                                paleontologist, and botanist. He went around the
                                world, and observed and collected the fauna,
                                flora, and geological formations from all the
                                places he visited during his expedition.<br>
                                <br>
                                Apart from observing the above stated objects in
                                their natural environments during his trip
                                abroad Beagle; he spent some twenty-three years
                                for his theories to come together and for the
                                impact of all he had seen to fall into place.<br>
                                <br>
                                Through his book, “The Origin of Species,”
                                Darwin showed the probability that every species
                                is a development from previous species, thereby
                                clearly implying that humans could as well have
                                evolved from earlier and different forms of
                                life. He believed “that all living things are
                                engaged in a fierce “struggle for existence”
                                and that the severe conditions of life tend to
                                kill off those animals and plants that inherit
                                unfavorable traits, thus ensuring “the
                                survival of the fittest.<br>
                                <br>
                                Darwin concluded that there exists a “natural
                                selection” of favorable variations that, in
                                the course of thousands of years, succeeded in
                                producing a remarkable variety of life forms
                                through the process of evolution.”<br>
                                <br>
                                I believe in Darwin’s theory, but there are
                                billions of people who refuse to believe in it
                                without first seeing evolution taking place
                                before their own eyes. But in case of the
                                biblical statement that claims that God had
                                created the first human couple in heaven and
                                that we are their descendents, they make no such
                                demands. Rather, they accept such a statement as
                                to be the gospel truth, which all believers are
                                taught to accept without ever raising any
                                questions on its veracity and truthfulness.<br>
                                <br>
                                To me, the above demand, often made by the
                                believers, seem not only illogical, but also
                                nonsensical. In my reckoning, most believers are
                                also hypocritical in the sense that while they
                                demand incontrovertible evidence on Darwin’s
                                theory of evolution, the same believers never
                                challenge the biblical statement that presents
                                itself without being accompanied by any palpable
                                proof or evidence.<br>
                                <br>
                                Why believers conduct themselves in such
                                duplicitous manners is a question I have tried
                                my best to find an answer to, but failed.
                                Perhaps, we should call upon the believers to
                                come forward with a convincing explanation in
                                order to put our curiosity to rest for ever.<br>
                                <br>
                                The dispute over the theory of evolution and the
                                creation of the first human couple in heaven
                                notwithstanding, our original parents lived a
                                perilous existence immediately after their
                                evolution or descent on earth from heaven. They
                                lived in caves to protect themselves from the
                                lurking beasts; they subsisted on whatever they
                                were able to lay their hands on.<br>
                                <br>
                                Their small number being a handicap, they dared
                                not go out of their caves even in the bright
                                light of the day. They passed their nights in
                                extreme fear. In winter, the combination of fear
                                and bone-piercing cold made their lives
                                extremely miserable. Perhaps, many died due to
                                cold, which they failed to ward off as, apart
                                from animal skins, most of them had nothing else
                                to cover their bodies with.<br>
                                <br>
                                Many of them must also have fallen victim to the
                                predatory animals that prowled their
                                neighborhoods for food.<br>
                                <br>
                                After a long period of time, their number
                                increased. The growth in their headcounts
                                brought them strength that enabled them not only
                                to undertake successful hunting trips; it also
                                helped them in facing collectively the numerous
                                hazards of their life.<br>
                                Eventually, they built huts for themselves; took
                                measures to save themselves from the attacks of
                                the predatory animals and tamed horses, donkeys
                                and bovine animals to serve as the means of
                                their transportation.<br>
                                <br>
                                They kept on improving their hunting tools and
                                skills as time went on. Discovery of fire by
                                them changed their life; it enabled them not
                                only to cook their food, it also helped them to
                                keep their bodies warm during winter.<br>
                                <br>
                                Traveling for a long time on their way to what
                                we call “civilization” today, our distant
                                ancestors invented cultivation - - a feat that
                                changed for ever their lifestyle together with
                                changing the landscape of our earth.<br>
                                <br>
                                Now living in communities on plain lands, with
                                their thinking ability improving and also,
                                having, in the meantime, acquired the ability to
                                speak to each other, the men of long time ago
                                launched themselves on a course of innovations
                                that still continues to keep our modern world
                                occupied. But even when struggling for their
                                survival, they often paused and tried to
                                understand themselves and their surroundings.
                                Their Homo religiosus instincts forced them to
                                ask questions about themselves, the world they
                                lived in and also about who was behind all the
                                creations.<br>
                                <br>
                                They debated among themselves, but found no
                                answer to their questions. Ultimately, they
                                sought the help of their “wise man.”<br>

                                The Birth of Nature Worshipping<br>
                                <br>
                                The wise man of long time ago put his wisdom to
                                great use. Knowing that his reputation was at
                                stake, he not only acted like many intellectuals
                                of our time, he also assumed the role of a
                                story-teller in order to make the dissemination
                                of his “knowledge” more appealing and
                                effective for those who sought it from him.<br>
                                <br>
                                According to some ancient writings, man of long
                                time ago believed that the earth emerged exactly
                                4,004 years before the Christian era from the
                                belly of a boa. Others thought that it was
                                Sun-god, which created the earth and the human
                                beings.<br>
                                <br>
                                Asked why the sun-god comes up in the morning
                                and then sinks in the evening, the wise man of
                                long time ago told the people of his time: The
                                sun up there in the skies is a Wheel of Fire on
                                which the Sun-Spirit takes a ride each day
                                across the skies to see the world and how his
                                creations were doing. At night the Sun-Spirit
                                puts the wheel of Fire away in the Hall of
                                Darkness and goes to bed. The next morning he
                                appears again to take another ride. But if the
                                Sun-Spirit feels lazy one day, or angry, he
                                would not take his ride and the sun would not
                                shine.<br>
                                <br>
                                “If the sun would not shine, how would we be
                                able to go hunting, or cultivate our land, for
                                our food?”<br>
                                <br>
                                “I do not know!” said the wise man of long
                                time ago. “But we can keep the Sun-Spirit from
                                being lazy and angry.” “How?” the men of
                                long time ago asked.<br>
                                <br>
                                “Easy!” answered the wise man of long time
                                ago. “When the sun comes up early in the
                                morning, we can go up to the mountain-top, as to
                                be quite close to the sun, then sing to the
                                Sun-Spirit and praise him for not being lazy.
                                That will flatter him and he won’t be lazy.”<br>
                                <br>
                                So the men of long time ago began worshipping
                                the sun-god.<br>
                                <br>
                                But what about the moon? Since the sun had a
                                Spirit that had to be flattered and praised,
                                surely the moon must also have a Spirit that
                                rode out every night.<br>
                                <br>
                                As they worshipped the Moon-Spirit, they also
                                considered the twinkling stares. The stars, too,
                                were up there in the skies where the Great
                                Spirit lived. And the men of long time ago
                                praised and flattered the stars, too.<br>
                                <br>
                                Slowly the Spirits to be praised and flattered
                                grew in number.<br>
                                <br>
                                There was the angry Spirit of the Thunder; the
                                busy Spirit of the Wind; the weeping Spirit of
                                the Rain; the gentle Spirit of the Rivers; the
                                mysterious Spirit of the Woods and the restless
                                Spirit of the Oceans. All these, and many more
                                the men of long time ago praised and worshipped.<br>
                                <br>
                                The worship of all the Spirits of Nature was the
                                first religion of Mankind. It is called the
                                Nature of Worship.<br>
                                <br>
                                The Birth of Idol Worshipping<br>
                                <br>
                                As the time went on, and the people became many
                                on earth with their thinking ability enhanced,
                                the Spirits they worshipped multiplied rapidly.<br>
                                <br>
                                “Not only are there Spirits of Nature,” said
                                the wise man of long time ago, “but there are
                                other Spirits!”<br>
                                <br>
                                “Other Spirits?” people asked, a little
                                frightened.<br>
                                <br>
                                “Yes,” said the wise man. “There are other
                                Spirits.”<br>
                                <br>
                                The wise story-teller disclosed to his folks the
                                existence of Family Spirit. Since the Spirit of
                                the sun lives on the sun and the Spirit of the
                                Moon on the moon, he surprised them with the
                                disclosure that the Spirits of their Family
                                lives in a frog. It is not an ordinary frog; it
                                is of the size of that hill yonder. It has one
                                eye, but its head is covered with ears. And out
                                of its forehead grows a golden horn.<br>
                                <br>
                                Told by his audience that they had never seen
                                such a frog, the story-teller made a stone image
                                of a frog, and painted its horn in gold.<br>
                                <br>
                                “If the wise man’s family has a Spirit in a
                                frog to protect it, surely we must have one,
                                too,” decided the common man.<br>
                                <br>
                                And they began making and worshipping the images
                                of their Family-Spirits.<br>
                                Very soon, there were thousand of images, made
                                of wood, clay and stone. There were little
                                images and big images. Images that looked like
                                Elephants, wolves, bears, lions, crocodiles and
                                fish. Some were half fish and half eagle. Some
                                were half snake and half stag. Some like cows
                                while others looked like no creature living on
                                earth.<br>
                                <br>
                                Believing in the efficacy of their idols, people
                                soon gave up the worshipping of the
                                Nature-Spirits. Instead, they began worshipping
                                many images, thus laying the foundation of
                                Polytheism.<br>
                                <br>
                                The idols, so people believed, if flattered
                                enough by prayers and sacrifices, had the power
                                to do good to the people who believed in them,
                                and to harm their enemies. If a man had a
                                problem with his neighbor, he could pray to his
                                favorite idol to make his neighbor’s cow give
                                bloody milk, or hurt him in some other way.<br>
                                <br>
                                But the neighbors had their idols, too. And
                                whilst a man prayed to his own idols to punish
                                and hurt his enemies, his heart remained uneasy
                                about what the Spirits of his enemies’ idols
                                might do to him and his household. So to protect
                                themselves against the power of the evil spirits
                                that fought on the side of their enemies, people
                                began to wear little images of their idols
                                around their necks. These we call amulets or
                                talismans.<br>
                                So long as they had those amulets or talisman
                                on, they believed, no evil could befall them.<br>
                                <br>
                                On the other hand, they believed they could harm
                                their enemies, if they had certain amulets in
                                their possession. With these beliefs taking hold
                                of the people, they began spending much time on
                                trying to perform magic, and in plotting to harm
                                their enemies through sorcery and witchcraft.<br>
                                <br>
                                Since every person had some enemies, everybody
                                began to be afraid all the time that their
                                enemies were at that time invoking the evil
                                powers to harm them. If a man became ill, he
                                believed his enemies had wished it upon him
                                through witchcraft, or by using the power of his
                                idol, and he started to think of ways to avenge

                                himself.<br>
                                <br>
                                When the situation turned very bad, some wise
                                people thought about it all over, and realized
                                that at the root of all this evil was
                                Idol-Worshipping. Consequently, some of these
                                wise men began preaching against the worship of
                                idols and images, and established new religions
                                that they believed were good for their common
                                folks.
