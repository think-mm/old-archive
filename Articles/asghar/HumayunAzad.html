                                  With the sudden demise in Germany of Dr. 
                                  Humayun Azad, we have lost a great human 
                                  being. He came to Germany, probably, to escape 
                                  from the sharp instruments of death of the 
                                  Islamic fundamentalists of Bangladesh, but 
                                  death, brought closer to him by their attack 
                                  some time ago, chased him to his “sanctuary,” 
                                  where he is believed to have died in his 
                                  sleep. To his admirers the cause of his death 
                                  is suspicious, and it would continue to 
                                  remains so, until the German authority carries 
                                  out its investigation, and puts their concern 
                                  on the cause of his death to rest.&nbsp; </p>
                                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                  When living in Bangladesh, I often used to 
                                  read his name in the newspapers, but<i> </i>I 
                                  never tried to find out what were his position 
                                  on Islam, and the rights it has supposedly 
                                  given to Muslim women. My ignorance on his 
                                  stand disappeared after I got the opportunity 
                                  to read his book “Naari.” </p>
                                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                  I believe Naari is a masterpiece of Dr. Azad. 
                                  It is a lode of learning for those people who 
                                  seek knowledge on an important subject as the 
                                  treatment of Muslim women by their religious 
                                  scripture is. He was passionate and highly 
                                  objective in his discourse, though the people 
                                  and the Government of Bangladesh had failed to 
                                  appreciate these qualities of his due to their 
                                  bigotry and ignorance.</p>
                                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                  Dr. Azad’s death is also a great loss for the 
                                  Freethinkers of the world. Though it would be 
                                  very difficult for us to find his replacement 
                                  in our midst soon, yet we shall have to 
                                  continue with our efforts to free a large 
                                  number of human beings from the destructive 
                                  clutches of Islam. I believe that our success, 
                                  no matter how modest, would be a befitting 
                                  tribute for Dr. Azad, and the legacy he has 
                                  left behind for all of us to emulate.</p>
                                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                  Let us work together to achieve what Dr. Azad 
                                  himself had tried to achieve during his 
                                  sojourn on earth. Only through our energized 
                                  efforts would we, the Freethinkers, ever be 
                                  able to pay our homage to a great man &nbsp;as Dr. 
                                  Azad was in his lifetime. Let us work harder 
                                  to free those human beings who have been 
                                  shackled, and consigned to ignominy and 
                                  wilderness by the inauspicious cult of Islam. 
                                  In their emancipation lies the wellbeing of 
                                  the world. Failure to play our due role in the 
                                  matter would not only make Dr. Azad’s efforts 
                                  redundant, it would also be a cause of 
                                  enormous sufferings for our future 
                                  generations.</p>
                                  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                  Therefore, let us continue with our efforts at 
                                  securing the future of our children and 
                                  grandchildren, despite being threatened, 
                                  attacked, hacked to death, or maimed by the 
                                  evil forces of Islam. In our sacrifice lies 
                                  our and our children’s salvation; we must 
                                  achieve it, no matter how high a price we must 
                                  pay for it. Shrinking from our responsibility 
                                  would mean disaster for mankind, and this we 
                                  must not allow to happen, even if we are 
                                  forced to sacrifice our lives. After all, life 
                                  is meaningless, if one cannot live it with 
                                  dignity, respect and honor. </p>

                                  I mourn Dr. Azad’s death with the members of 
                                  his family. I hope they would be able to 
                                  overcome their grief soon, for, though he is 
                                  no more in their midst, but his achievements 
                                  and courage and other human qualities are 
                                  strong substitutes to compensate for his 
                                  physical absence. These should inspire not 
                                  only to hold themselves to his memory, but 
                                  these should also give them enough strength to 
                                  continue with their life. I wish them all the 
                                  best in future.</p>
