                                that, according to some Bangladeshi newspapers,
                                has been launched by the Bangladeshi Imams for
                                eradicating dowry from their country. As far as
                                I am concerned, it is a good news and the Imams

                                efforts of the Imams I deemed to be
                                praiseworthy.</p>

text-indent:.2in">At the outset, I need to remind readers that Islam does not
                                permit a woman to marry a man; the right to
                                marry rests in her would-be husband’s hand.
                                Similarly, a Muslim wife cannot divorce her
                                husband, no matter how bad he is, or even if he
                                is impotent. Should a wife feel compelled to
                                break her marriage, she can achieve this only
                                through her husband, who has the sole right to
                                “free her from her bondage,” provided she
                                agrees to return to him the dower he gave her at
                                the time of their marriage.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">Contrary to the dowry system that is current in the Indian
                                sub-continent, the Islamic law requires the
                                Muslim bridegrooms to pay dowers to their
                                would-be Muslim brides. It is like buying a
                                commodity; you pay for what you want to buy. If
                                the commodity is not good, or if it is stale or
                                second-hand, you pay a certain price. But if it
                                is fresh, unused and catching to your eyes, you
                                don’t mind paying a higher price. That is
                                exactly what is now in practice in the birth
                                place of the Prophet of Islam.</p>

text-indent:.2in">Interestingly, men, like women, also grow old, but they never
                                become stale or second-hand, despite their
                                living with, or marrying a number of women. They
                                always remain fresh as far as their bodies are
                                concerned. On the other hand, women lose their
                                freshness and charm as a result of bearing, and
                                delivering children. Such women have less value
                                in the “cattle market” than do the virgin
                                ones, hence the Arabs’ insistence on unmarried
                                girls for maintaining their virginity at any
                                cost.</p>

                                parents lost their investments, and these they
                                always refused to part with under any

text-indent:.2in">Should Muslim men rape their wives, if they so wished? Why
                                not? When you buy a thing, you become its owner.
                                The ownership gives you the right to use it in
                                any manner that suites your taste and fancy. And
                                this right becomes legitimately enforceable,
                                when your God-given religious scripture tells
                                you that your wives are like your field. Enter
                                them and use them in any manner you like, for it
                                is a farmer’s right to “chooses his own time

                                sowing his seeds, he needs no permission or

text-indent:.2in">The situation in respect to marrying off daughters in the
                                Indian sub-continent is quite different. Here
                                parents, irrespective of their religious
                                affiliations, always want to get rid of their
                                assumedly “un-saleable” daughters by
                                offering dowers to their would-be sons-in-law.
                                It is like paying incentive to the house
                                cleaners the people in the West employ: They
                                give them money to take away what they know has
                                become unusable or un-saleable, for this not
                                only saves them huge storage cost, it also helps
                                them create additional space within their homes.</p>

                                the Quran? The Holy Book is not at all vague in
                                the matter of dowry: It makes it absolutely
                                clear that it is the grooms’ responsibility to
                                pay dowers to their would-be brides; it is not

                                their brethren’s sufferings, what they need to
                                do is to issue a strong <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fatwa</i>.
                                In it, they must state clearly, and
                                unambiguously that to pay dowers to the would-be
                                bridegrooms is a great sin (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gonah-e-Kabira</i>)
                                and that the committers of this great sin shall
                                enjoy no bliss of heaven; rather, they shall be
                                burning forever in the inferno of hell after
                                being judged guilty by God on the Day of
                                Judgment. This <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fatwa</i>
                                must be issued from each mosque of <st1:country-region>

                                it effective. Lukewarm efforts would yield no
