	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am penning this article after 
	being inspired by the slogan the Daily Star of Bangladesh carries on its 
	front page. It claims that it is a newspaper that is engaged in “Journalism 
	without fear or favour.” I am sure the Daily Star would keep its promise or 
	assurance to its readers by publishing this article on one of its main 
	pages. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In its issue of September 23, 2005, 
	the Daily News has published a news item under the headline of “Political 
	double standards must stop to end global terrorism.” The demand to shun 
	political double standards to end global terrorism was raised in a seminar 
	held in Dhaka. The seminar was titled “Islam: Religion of Peace, Progress 
	and Harmony; Bangladesh: Model of a Moderate Muslim Nation.” Many local and 
	regional intellectuals and Muslim scholars took part in this seminar. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All the participants of the seminar 
	declared that “Islam is a treasure of peace and doctrine of disciplines; 
	everybody should understand Islam as a religion promoting peace and 
	progress.” This was, in my judgment, the catch phrase that has induced most 
	of the newspapers of Bangladesh to print it on their front pages. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But is Islam really a treasure of 
	peace and doctrine of disciplines? Does it promote progress? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To find out answers to the above 
	questions, we need to investigate how and why Islam was founded and also, if 
	its doctrines, as outlined in the Quran, promote peace and progress among 
	Muslims and the practitioners of other faiths. Since delving in all the 
	details would become voluminous, I am restricting myself to some of the 
	salient features of Islam with the hope that those readers who are desirous 
	of learning more about this faith and its doctrines would satisfy their 
	inquisitiveness by carrying out their own researches on them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Contrary to the general belief, the 
	religion of Islam was not intended for the people of the entire world. The 
	fact that the Prophet Muhammad had launched his movement to dislodge the 
	Quraish priests from the highly profitable posts of the Ka’aba and to have 
	them reallocated to himself and to his followers is inferable from the Quran 
	itself. His aforesaid attempt was akin to the attempt that Jesus Christ had 
	made for removing the Jewish rabbis from their top priestly positions of the 
	temples of Jerusalem. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">About the Prophet’s movement, the 
	Quran says: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Thus have We sent by inspiration to 
	thee an Arabic Quran: that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities [i.e. 
	Mecca] and around her, - and warn (them) of the Day of Assembly, of which 
	there is no doubt: (when) some will be in the Garden, and some in the 
	Blazing Fire (42:7). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above stipulation of the Quran 
	is reinforced by another verse in which it is stated: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“For me, I have been commanded to 
	serve the Lord of this City [i.e. Mecca], Him Who has sanctified it and to 
	Whom (belong) all things: and I am commanded to be of those who bow in Islam 
	to Allah’s Will, - (27:91). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is clear from the above two 
	verses of the Quran that the scope and the purpose of Islam were limited to 
	the City of Mecca and that it was an unnamed Deity who had commanded the 
	Prophet Muhammad to serve the Lord [i.e. Allah] of Mecca, who had sanctified 
	it and to whom belonged all the things that this City contained at that 
	time. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Maulana Abul Ala Mududi’s comment on 
	verse 27:91 is succinct. He says: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Finally, the sura addresses itself 
	to the excuse often put forward by the Meccan unbelievers. They argued that 
	if they accepted the new, monotheistic Faith and abandon their old 
	polytheistic religion, they would lose their religious, political and social 
	ascendancy among the Arabs. The result of embracing the new Faith would be 
	that, far from remaining the most powerful tribe in Arabia, they would be 
	reduced to a tribe devoid of power and standing and be deprived of security 
	and protection. This was the real reason behind the Quraysh nobility’s 
	non-acceptance of Islam. .. (Towards Understanding the Quran; Vol. 7, p. 
	194). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islam’s original purpose, scope, 
	intention and design changed after the Prophet’s migration to Medina. Here, 
	he saw a different prospect for his creed. Here, he found a group of people 
	he could make pay him with their life and wealth for refusing to accept his 
	Islamic doctrines. And these people were the rich Jews of Medina whose other 
	offence was that they exercised great influence on the Pagans of this City.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In order to subdue the Meccan Pagans 
	and the Jews of Medina and its neighborhood, the Prophet of Islam launched 
	over one hundred raids and expeditions. He personally took part in 
	twenty-seven of them. He tried to loot a peaceful and unarmed caravan of the 
	Meccans (cf. Quran; 3:13; and also see Abdullah Yusuf Ali’s comment 352, The 
	Holy Quran, Vol. 1. p. 125). He fought three major battles against the 
	Meccan Pagans and these were the battles of Badr, Ditch and of Uhud. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhammad had launched all the raids 
	and expeditions and fought all the battles not only to spread Islam but also 
	to kill and plunder his enemies as well as to enslave their women for his 
	and his followers’ sexual pleasure. On deriving sexual pleasure from the 
	slaves (who are referred to in the Quran as “the possession of the Muslims’ 
	right hands), the Muslims’ Holy Book says: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“O Prophet! We have made lawful to 
	thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right 
	hand possess out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; 
	and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and the daughters of thy 
	maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated (from Mecca) with thee; and any 
	believing women who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes 
	to wed her; - this only for thee and not for the believers (at large); We 
	know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom 
	their right hands possess; - in order that there should be no difficulty for 
	thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” (Quran; 33:50). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fact that Islam had become a 
	dominant force in the Arabian Peninsula through murder, loot and enslavement 
	negates all the claims we now hear from Muslims and their scholars. A 
	doctrine that took birth in such a manner can neither be a peaceful one, nor 
	its application at any time and at any place can be defended by anyone who 
	has some elements of intelligence and common sense. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Intolerance towards non-Muslims was 
	one of the important characteristics of the Prophet of Islam. On the 
	authority of Ubaydullah b. Abdullah b. Utba b. Masud tells us the following: 
	“The only dispositions that the Apostle made at his death were three: He 
	bequeathed to the Rahawis land which produced a hundred loads in Khaybar, to 
	the Dariyis, the Sabais, and the Asharis the same. He also gave instructions 
	that the mission of Usama bin Zayd b. Haritha should be carried through and 
	that two religions should not be allowed to remain in the Peninsula of the 
	Arabs (Sirat Rasulallah, p. 523). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is in keeping with the Prophet’s 
	instruction from his deathbed that has forced the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
	not to permit any religion other than Islam to exist on its soil. The fact, 
	being what I have briefly stated above, does not support the claim made by 
	all Muslims and their scholars. Their claims are simply untrue and baseless.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Put in a nutshell: Islam is not 
	tolerant of other religions. Therefore, to claim that it is a religion of 
	peace and harmony is simply untenable. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims of all hues and backgrounds 
	claim that Bangladesh is a moderate Islamic country. It is not true, as was 
	the claim of the Bangladesh government on the existence of Islamic 
	terrorists on its soil. Despite the fact that a large number of observers, 
	both local and international, had always drawn the government’s attention to 
	the looming threats it faced from the Islamic terrorists, almost all 
	political leaders of the country, including its Prime Minister, brushed them 
	aside with the proclamation that due to the very nature of Islam, no Muslim 
	could ever take up terrorism as a tool to achieve their political and 
	economic goals. The events of August 17, 2005 proved that most, if not all, 
	of the Bangladeshi leaders were liars. They are now trying to apprehend 
	those criminals whose existence they never acknowledged until the Islamic 
	terrorists knocked at their doors with their Islamic bombs. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Like the Bangladeshi political 
	leaders, Muslim scholars have also been disseminating lies in order to prove 
	that Bangladesh is a moderate nation. I would have taken their claim as 
	being a credible one, if they had also declared that Muslims do not need to 
	rely on the Quran and that what are stated in it were meant for the time it 
	was revealed to Prophet Muhammad. A Muslim leader cannot be a moderate 
	leader or turn his or her country into a moderate nation, if that leader is 
	a good Muslim. Here is the reason based on which I have made the above 
	statement: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Quran says: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Fight those who believe not in 
	Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by 
	Allah and His Apostle, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth [i.e. Islam] 
	(even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with 
	willing submission, and feel themselves subdued” (9:29). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Through the above revelation, Allah 
	has made it compulsory for the Muslim leaders to fight the non-Muslims until 
	they acknowledge Islam and to agree to pay higher taxes with willing 
	submission (to Islam) and feel themselves subdued (dhimmitude is the other 
	name of “subduedness”). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the light of the above 
	stipulation of the Quran, how can a Muslim, having a little bit of common 
	sense, claim that Islam promotes equality, moderation, tolerance and peace?
	</font></p>
