  <p align="justify">After marching another six or seven miles, Muslim forces
  set tents a short distance from the wells of Badr, which the opposing army was
  also approaching, each being ignorant of the other's movement. The informant
  employed by Muhammad brought him news that the Meccan forces were on their way
  to the place where his troops were encamped. At this news, the hearts of some
  of Muhammad's fighters sank, for they had joined the foray, expecting a little
  fight and much plunder. Now, they felt overwhelmed by the reported strength of
  their opponents, and dismayed at the prospect of fighting a fierce battle.
  Muhammad assured them victory in the following words:<br>
  <br>
  O Apostle! Rouse the Believers<br>
  To the fight. If there are<br>
  Twenty amongst you, patient<br>
  And persevering, they will<br>
  Vanquish two hundred: if a hundred,<br>
  They will vanquish a thousand<br>
  Of the Unbelievers: for these<br>
  Are a people without understanding (8:65).<br>
  <br>
  Muhammad's above statement was based on the Meccans' reported strength of
  about one thousand fighters. For raising his men' fighting spirits, he equated
  one of them with ten of their enemies. When his men questioned the absurdity
  of the equation, he unashamedly revised his nonsensical statement, stating:<br>
  <br>
  For the present, God<br>
  Hath lightened your (task),<br>
  For He knoweth that there is<br>
  A weak spot in you:<br>
  But (even so), if there are<br>
  A hundred of you, patient<br>
  And persevering, they will<br>
  Vanquish two hundred, and if<br>
  A thousand, they will vanquish<br>
  Two thousand, with the leave<br>
  Of God: for God is with those<br>
  Who patiently persevere (8:66).<br>
  <br>
  He brought down the fighting strength of his one man to that of two men of his
  enemy. This equation seemed reasonable to his fighting men, for they were
  three hundred and fourteen and their opponents about six to seven hundred,
  which means one Muslim combatant was required to take on, approximately, 1.91
  to 2.23 men of the pagans in order to win the battle. Under the difficult
  conditions the Meccans faced, Muslim needed no heavenly intervention to
  overcome the superior number of their opponents.<br>
  <br>
  After assuring success to his troops, Muhammad positioned them on a raised
  ground, with water at its foot. The troops, using the branches of date trees,
  erected a hut on the summit for Muhammad to take rest therein. They also kept
  a fleet camel standing by for him to escape, should the Meccan army defeat
  them.<br>
  <br>
  The vanguard of the Meccan troops entered the valley, panting with thirst, and
  hastened to the stream for a drink. Hamza, the uncle of Muhammad, set a number
  of his men upon them and slew their commander with his own hand. Only a single
  soldier of the Meccan vanguard escaped the slaughter.<br>
  <br>
  The main body of the Meccan forces now arrived at the venue of the last
  massacre, challenging the bravest of the Muslim fighters to equal combat. A
  number of individual fights took place in which all of the Meccan challengers
  were defeated and slain. The battle then turned into a general melee.<br>
  <br>
  Muslims, aware of their inferior strength, at first adopted a defensive
  posture from their strategic position on top of the hill (8:42). From their
  upper ground, they assailed the Meccans with flights of arrows, whenever they
  sought to quench their intolerable thirst at the stream below. Muhammad,
  during all this time, remained within his hut worrying about the outcome of
  the battle.<br>
  <br>
  The sporadic arrow flights soon flared up into a furious sword fight. In spite
  of their superior numbers, the Quraishites suffered a number of tactical
  disadvantages. They had advanced against the Muslims across the soft sand
  dunes, which left them victims of exhaustion after travelling for 12 days on
  foot, mules and horses (see Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah, The Battlefield of the
  Prophet Muhammad, p.49), whereas the believers awaited them standing on firm
  soil, precluding any exertion whatsoever. Moreover, Muslims controlled the
  most essential commodity of the desert warfare: the water. The Meccans had
  none, and without it, no army - -no matter how strong and large its size - -
  could win a battle even against a smaller enemy, let alone the highly charged
  Muslim forces the pagans were faced with in this battle.<br>
  <br>
  In spite of their setback, the Meccans were engaging the Muslims in a fierce
  fight when a violent squall whipped the sand into their faces, almost blinding
  them.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Gabriel,&quot; cried Muhammad ecstatically, &quot;with a thousand angels
  is falling upon the enemy!&quot; God increased the number of the angels to
  three thousand strong; in order to defeat a force of infidels, numbering about
  six to seven hundred, that was fighting a battle under some of the most
  insurmountable conditions.<br>
  <br>
  Suddenly, as if to bolster the faith of his fighters in him, Muhammad rushed
  out of his hut, and picking up a handful of dust, cast it at the Meccans,
  crying out, &quot;Confusion on their faces.&quot; Then ordering his men to
  charge upon the enemy, he cried: &quot;Fight, and fear not,&quot; for
  &quot;the gates of Paradise are under the shade of sword. He will assuredly
  find instant admission who falls fighting for the faith.&quot; While the
  battle was raging, Abu Jahl, who was urging his horse into the thickest of the
  conflict, received the blow of a scimitar and fell to the ground. Abdullah Ibn
  Masoud put his foot upon his breast and severed his head from his body.<br>
  <br>
  For some time, the fight swayed back and forth, without either side gaining a
  clear advantage. At long last, the Meccans began to waver and lost ground.
  Then suddenly they broke and fled. Fifty of them remained dead on the ground,
  and nearly the same number was taken prisoners. Of the Muslims, eight were
  slain, whose names remain on record as martyrs to the faith.<br>
  <br>
  The battle over, Abdullah Ibn Masoud brought the head of Abu Jahl to Muhammad.
  Eyeing the grisly trophy with exultation, he exclaimed, &quot;This man was the
  Pharaoh of our Nation.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The number of causalities on the pagan side prove one point: That there were
  not as many pagan warriors involved in the battle of Badr as Muslim historians
  made out in their recollection of the event.. They exaggerated the number of
  the pagan enemy in order to extol the Muslim virtues by dint of which, most
  Muslims believe, Muhammad and his followers defeated a &quot;huge&quot; number
  of their enemies, an inspiration that most Muslims of the present time are
  exhorted to employ while fighting their infidel foes. Or, the battle fought
  was not a fierce one, but the Muslim historians made it as such so that
  Muhammad looked like a victim, and not a perpetrator, of the crime that he
  committed against the pagans.<br>
  <br>
  Muslim ascribes attribute success in this battle to invisible angelic
  participation, noting that a thousand of them clad in long dazzling robes with
  white and yellow turbans, mounted on black and white stallions, came rushing
  like a blast and swept the Quraishites before them. They mention a pagan
  shepherd who had witnessed the miracle taking place and he, in this
  connection, is believed to have made the following statement:<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I was with a companion, a cousin,&quot; said the witness, &quot;upon the
  fold of the mountain, watching the conflict, and waiting to join the victors
  to share the spoil. Suddenly we saw a great cloud moving toward us, and within
  it were the neighing of steeds and sound of trumpets. As it approached, we
  heard the terrific voice of the archangel as he urged his mare Haizum,
  &quot;Speed! Speed! Oh Haizum!&quot; At which awful sound the heart of my
  companion burst with terror, and he died on the spot. I, too, had almost
  shared his fate.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Ibn Abbas, who had testified to the occurrence, his statement having been
  confirmed by none other than Muhammad himself, corroborated the pagan's
  statement.<br>
  The gist of the matter stands as follows: God had sent down a large contingent
  of angels to fight against a small number of human beings, and the angels rode
  steeds - - in spite of their having at least a pair of wings to fly with - -
  undetected by human eyes and senses.<br>
  <br>
  Before the victorious Muslims returned to Madina, a quarrel broke out among
  themselves over the distribution of the spoils. Though the caravan of Abu
  Sofian, which God had promised to the believers, had escaped, yet considerable
  booty of weapons and camels had fallen to the lot of the Muslims.
  Additionally, the prisoners were also expected to produce, through their
  ransom, a large sum of money, a prospect that none of the Muslim soldiers
  wanted to miss.<br>
  <br>
  Muhammad ordered the booty divided equally among all the Muslims, who fought
  the battle.&nbsp; Although it was a long established custom among the Arabs to
  give a fourth part of the booty to their chief, he contended himself with the
  same share as that of the rest.<br>
  <br>
  The equal distribution of the booty caused great dissatisfaction among the
  troops. Those who had taken part in the actual fighting and had been most
  active in collecting the spoils demanded a larger share than those who had
  stood aloof from the fray, as well as those old men who had remained back to
  guard the camp. The settlement of the issue became an important matter for
  Muhammad, especially when he, as a leader, was about to embark upon a career
  of predatory warfare. He, accordingly, decreed that in future, a fifth of the
  war-spoils would go to him and God, and the remaining would be distributed
  among those who fought in the battles (8:41). In the distribution of the
  booty, Muhammad and God were to have first preference of choice: They were to
  select their part first, whereafter the leftovers were to be distributed among
  other claimants of the booty (Ibn Ishaq, op. cit. p.643).<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">THE BATTLE OF UHUD<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Muhammad and his troops returned in triumph to Madina with
  the spoils and prisoners taken in the battle. Their success on the
  battleground propelled their prestige and morale to an extraordinary height.
  Having tasted the fruits of success, Muslims clamored for more expeditions
  against the pagans, primarily to loot them and to turn their womenfolk into
  their slaves.<br>
  <br>
  Muhammad was not oblivious to the desires of his people. In fact, he himself
  possessed just such a yearning in his own heart. But in the absence of an
  opportunity, he dared not initiate an action that could have turned off those
  pagans who were seriously considering their assimilation into his religion.
  Wherefore, in wait for an opportunity, he busied himself momentarily in the
  propagation of his faith.<br>
  In this effort, he found himself making little progress due to assaults
  launched against him by the satirical poets of the city. Muhammad, however,
  found an effective way to deal with this menace: he engaged one of them to
  defend him. Hassan Ibn Thabit was middle-aged and had already achieved fame as
  a poet. He had spent some years at the court of Bani Ghassan princes in Syria.
  Asked by Muhammad if he could defend him from the attacks of his enemies,
  Hassan is said to have stuck out his tongue and declared, &quot;There is no
  armor that I cannot pierce with this weapon.&quot;<br>
  Many of the pagan and Jewish satirical poets were silenced by Hassan's
  quick-witted responses. Still, there remained some who continued, unabated, to
  ridicule Muhammad and his doctrines with their satires. Hassan could not
  handle them ultimately, so Muhammad decided to take measures against them.<br>
  <br>
  In implementation of his decision, Asma, a Jewish poetess, was put to death
  for her satirical effusions. Abu Afak, an Israelite of very ripe age, was
  likewise slain for indulging in satire against Muhammad. Another Jewish poet,
  Kaab Ibn Ashraf, who tried to rouse the Quraishites to vengeance paid dearly
  with his life.<br>
  <br>
  Having rid himself of the satirical poets, Muhammad turned his attention to
  another serious problem. The Jews of Madina, he felt, had become increasingly
  hostile to him as time passed, and he found them erecting stumbling blocks on
  his way to success. He, therefore, decided to confront them with an iron hand.<br>
  <br>
  The recent victory at Badr had completely changed Muhammad's position; he was
  now a triumphant chief of a growing power. He felt highly confident of success
  in campaigns that he thought of initiating against his Jewish enemies. The
  first Jewish community that he took action against was the tribe of Bani
  Qainuqa. The members of this tribe were goldsmiths and were probably the
  richest among the Jewish tribes. They numbered about seven hundred; three
  hundred of whom are said to have been armed. They also made armor but owned no
  fields or fruit gardens. An altercation in the market, involving two Muslims
  and a Jew, provided Muhammad with an excuse to lay siege against the entire
  settlement to which the offending Jew belonged. It lasted for two weeks and
  then the Jews surrendered. Muhammad promptly sentenced them to death.<br>
  <br>
  Two tribes among the Aus and the Khazraj were allies of Bani Qainuqa, but both
  had embraced Islam. The leader of the first tribe went to Muhammad and
  renounced the alliance. Abdullah Ibn Ubay was the leader of the other ally
  whom we have already met as being a peace-loving man who abhorred bloodshed.
  On hearing of the death sentence declared on the tribe of Bani Qainuqa,
  Abdullah rushed to Muhammad, and taking hold of his cloak, begged him to spare
  the lives of the condemned Jews.<br>
  <br>
  Muhammad, reacting in an angry rage, at first refused to oblige him, but
  overtaken by his insistence as well as by his political insight, relented and
  spared the lives of the seven hundred doomed Jewish men.&nbsp; He however
  ordered them to leave Madina and settle in Syria. At the time of their
  migration, they were compelled to leave most of their property behind them.
  They were permitted to take that many animals as were necessary to carry them
  to their destination.<br>
  <br>
  The expulsion of the Jews from Madina helped Muhammad to overcome some of his
  immediate problems. It enabled him, first of all, to solve most of the
  accommodation problem of the Meccan refugees by allotting them the abandoned
  homes of the expelled Jews. Secondly, the wealth the Jews had left behind
  helped him to start building up his own state exchequer to finance the future
  expeditions, which, he knew, were just around the corner.<br>
  <br>
  The recent defeat at the hands of the Muslims at Badr had struck the
  Quaraishites of Mecca with humiliation and astonishment. They failed to
  understand how a fugitive recently driven from their midst could muster the
  strength to challenge them to a battle and then rob them of their pride.
  Several of their bravest and ablest men had fallen victim to his sword; yet,
  as if not content with this, he had taken many of their men captives and now
  awaited a humiliating ransom.<br>
  <br>
  Abu Lahab, Muhammad's uncle and always his staunchest opponent, had been
  unable to take part in the last battle due to his illness. He died a few days
  after hearing of the Meccans' ignominious rout, his death, it is believed,
  having been hastened by the exasperation of his spirits.<br>
  <br>
  But no one was as much touched by the tragedy of the battle, as was Abu Sofian.
  It was one thing to reach Mecca safely; it was another to hear about the
  triumph of the man he detested from the core of his heart, and finding his own
  home desolate. He was more agonized by the lamentations of his wife, Hinda,
  who had lost her father, her uncle, and her brother to the swords of Hamza and
  Ali. She was now crying out in rage day and night for vengeance on those men.<br>
  <br>
  In her desire for revenge, Hinda vowed not to anoint her hair and not to sleep
  with her husband or any of her lovers until all the deaths of her near and
  dear ones were avenged. Abu Sofian also swore not to eat food cooked in oil
  and not to sleep with his wife or any of his paramours until he had taken
  revenge for the deaths of the leaders of his Quraish clan.<br>
  <br>
  Abu Sofian and Hinda had taken those vows of vengeance following a tribal law
  of the Arabs, which ordained that whoever shed the blood of a man owed blood
  on that account to the family of the slain person. Muhammad upheld this
  ancient barbarous law and gave sanction to retaliatory acts of bloodshed, for
  he said: &quot;Believers, retaliation is decreed for you in bloodshed: a free
  man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  While Abu Sofian was thinking to raise a Meccan army to attack the Muslims,
  Muhammad set out, in June of 624 A.D., with four hundred and fifty men to raid
  the tribes of Ghatafan. They received timely warning, however, and moved away
  to safety. Muslims returned home without fighting or spoils. This expedition
  is called &quot;The raid of Dhu Amr.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Two months later, Muhammad again set out with three hundred of his raiders to
  raid Bani Sulaim. They reached a place called Bahran and, finding no one,
  returned to Madina, again empty-handed.<br>

  The Meccans regularly heard about those raids, conducted by Muhammad, and they
  quivered in fear. While they were still trying to figure out ways to contain
  his growing power, time came to send their yearly caravan to Syria. Knowing
  the risk their caravan faced if it traveled by the conventional route, they
  decided to send it to its destination via Najd, a route that was not
  frequently used by caravans and which they considered to be a safe passage.
  Somehow, information about the caravan bearing toward Najd reached Madina,
  giving Muhammad ample time to prepare himself for its seizure.<br>
  <br>
  He gathered a team of one hundred brigands headed by his adopted son, Zaid Ibn
  Harith, and detailed it with its mission. The marauders surprised the caravan
  and captured it at the well of Qadra in Najd. The rapine proved extremely rich
  for the Muslims, for a great part of the caravan had been laden with silver.<br>
  <br>
  Following the events of Badr and Najd, the Quraishites set up a fund with the
  intention of financing the build up of a powerful army. It seems that the fund
  was well subscribed, the ordinary Meccans and their merchants keenly
  recognizing the perils with which the Muslims had endangered their means of
  livelihood. At the same time, they called upon Bani Kinana, who lived on the
  coastal plain and had a pact of cooperation with them, to assist them in their
  struggle against the Muslims. As was the custom, eminent poets were also asked
  to join the expeditionary forces to stir up their valor and ferocity in the
  impending battle.<br>
  <br>
  Soon after the raising of a strong force was completed for curtailing
  Muhammad's plunderous activities, it left Mecca on its way to Madina under the
  command of Abu Sofian, presently the most prominent leader of the Meccans. It
  consisted approximately of three thousand men, the majority of them fully
  equipped for the battle. The Meccan army arrived on a Wednesday below the
  mount called Uhud and remained there, resting until Thursday. In the meantime,
  the news of the arrival of this massive force reached Muhammad, causing
  serious consternation among the Muslims. They held hasty consultation to find
  ways to face the threat, Muhammad being inclined to defend the city from
  within, in order to avoid the exposure of his forces in an open field.<br>
  <br>
  Many elders, including Abdullah Ibn Ubay, strongly supported Muhammad. All the
  younger people, who had not had the chance to take part in the battle of Badr
  and were consequently deprived of the booty, insisted on going out to fight
  the enemy in the open. Their insistence had its roots in their belief in
  Muhammad, who had attributed the Muslim victory at Badr to the heavenly help,
  rather than to human strength. They believed that God would help them with
  angels this time, too, and make them victorious over their enemy. Their
  inferior number, therefore, was of no consequence to them, nor it made any
  difference in their thinking process.<br>
  Nevertheless, Abdullah still insisted on remaining within the city and
  defending it without putting their lives at unnecessary risk. Muhammad stalled
  a decision, but when his young followers became irresistible, he gave in.
  Donning his armor, he left the safety of the city, accompanied by his troops,
  to fight his enemy on the turf that the latter had chosen to test his strength
  once again.<br>
  <br>
  On Saturday morning, Muhammad and his troops sighted the enemy. Abdullah Ibn
  Ubay, seeing the strength of the Quraish forces, turned back with three
  hundred of his followers, leaving Muhammad with only seven hundred Muslims to
  fight the large number of the infidels. Undeterred by the defection, Muhammad
  continued his advance, in course of which, he assured his soldiers of
  receiving help from five thousand angels, provided he and his followers
  remained firm and acted diligently. In a short time, Muhammad found himself
  facing his formidable antagonists, determined to inflict a singular defeat on
  him and his followers.<br>
  <br>
  In spite of being outnumbered by the enemy, Muhammad proceeded to draw his men
  in order of battle. To deal with the mounted Meccans, he placed fifty of his
  archers on the Muslim flank, with strict orders to repel any attack by the
  enemy's horsemen and on no account to leave their strategic position. He then
  handed over his standard to Musab Ibn Omar and his sword to Abu Dujana, with
  orders to smite the enemy until it bent in his hand.<br>
  <br>
  Both sides now faced each other. As was their tradition, single combats
  between valiant warriors from both sides opened the contest. When Muslims saw
  the Meccan veterans being defeated by their warriors, they rushed forward
  shouting their war cry, &quot;Allahu Akbar,&quot; and fell upon the enemy with
  the same defiance and fury that had brought them a grand victory at the battle
  of Badr. In the rampant bloodshed that ensued, Muslims, it is said, gained the
  upper hand when some of the pagans took flight. At this juncture, the archers
  posted on the flank to keep the enemy horsemen at bay allegedly left their
  station to join their advancing swordsmen in order to lay their claim to the
  plunder.<br>
  <br>
  At this moment, a Meccan cavalry saw the Muslim archers leaving their
  position. Seizing the opportunity, they swung around and charged the
  unprotected rear of the advancing Muslim line, which included Muhammad, and
  some of his soldiers. The unexpected onslaught created a state of pell-mell in
  the rank of the Muslim forces- a situation that inspired the Meccans to rally
  around their standard of war.<br>
  <br>
  In the confusion that occurred in the Muslim rank and file, a swordsman by the
  name of Ibn Qamia, of Bani Kinana, attacked Musab Ibn Omar, Muhammad's
  standard-bearer, and cut him down with a single slash from his sword.
  Mistaking his victim for Muhammad, Qamia waved his sword over his head and
  cried, &quot;I have killed Muhammad! Muhammad is dead!&quot; Muslims, already
  disoriented by the rear attack of the horsemen, panicked uncontrollably by the
  news of their leader's death and fled. In their haste, they ran past Muhammad
  and the little group around him without even seeing him. His shouts to reunite
  and to fight also went unnoticed. Taking advantage of the disarray in the
  Muslim camp, the Meccans began moving toward the small group that was
  surrounding Muhammad, showering on it a rain of arrows, as well as stones from
  their slings. A stone struck Muhammad in the face, knocking out one of his
  incisors. He also received a blow on his head, forcing him to fall to the
  ground, his visage fully covered with blood.<br>
  <br>
  Here a miracle-like event is again believed to have taken place. A group of
  Meccans went past Muhammad, who was lying helplessly on the ground, mortally
  wounded. As willed by God, his enemies failed to recognize him. The so-called
  miracle that saved Muhammad from his enemies inspires Muslims even today. The
  very mention of it turns them into a kind of ecstasy that is not possible for
  a man to display in a normal condition.<br>
  <br>
  Once the Meccans passed by, Muhammad got up from the ground and supported by a
  small group of his followers, he hurried up the rocky slopes of Mount Uhud,
  where he concealed himself in a hollow.<br>
  <br>
  For the Meccans, the battle was over.&nbsp; They took pride in the fact that
  they had defeated the Muslims. Before leaving the battlefield, however, Abu
  Sofian stood at a point opposite the hollow where Muhammad had hidden himself,
  and called up to the Muslims to know if, in fact, Muhammad was dead. On being
  told by Omar that he was alive and that he was hearing them speak at that very
  moment, Abu Sofian threw a challenge to the Muslims to meet him at Badr next
  year for another round of fighting, and then left the grounds to saddle his
  camels and horses in preparation for the journey that would take him back to
  Mecca and into the arms of those on whose behalf he had, in 625 A. D, waged
  and won the just concluded battle.<br>
  <br>
  Muslims attribute the lack of desire on Abu Sofian's part to kill Muhammad to
  a miracle, which they claim, God had caused, along with others, as described
  above, to save him from death.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is one of the
  fallacious beliefs that is known to have always been helping the believers in
  adhering to their faiths. In reality, neither science nor philosophy accepts
  the existence of miracles. &quot;For instance,&quot; wrote Dr. Rafiq Zakaria,
  &quot;Cicero declared that 'there are no such things as miracles;' they were
  invented 'for the piety of the ignorant folk.' Celsus said that miracles,
  whether attributed to Christ or Moses, were 'insufficiently attested and most
  improbable.'&quot; But, despite knowing the fact that miracles do not exist,
  many scholars and scientists, inspired by their respective religions, suffered
  from its tantalizing spell. The above-named Muslim gentleman is one among many
  scholars who believed in the scientific fact, but forced by his Muslim
  conviction, he sacrificed science at the altar of his religion so that he
  could attribute Muhammad's success at Badr to a miracle. He concurred:
  &quot;The fact that he {Muhammad} won the battle {of Badr} was, indeed, a
  miracle. That is why he attributed it entirely to God (Muhammad &amp; the
  Quran, pp. 25 &amp; 32).<br>
  <br>
  The real reason behind sparing Muhammad's life by Abu Sofian was, perhaps, the
  non-blood thirsty nature of the pagans. The nomadic pagans fought wars and
  battles among themselves, either for plundering or for revenge, but they
  always avoided shedding blood of their own people. It was this tribal practice
  that prevented Abu Sofian from killing Muhammad, whom he considered to be one
  of his kindred, despite the fact that he had committed many offences against
  his own people. Alternatively, Abu Sofian might have believed that by sparing
  his life, he was doing Muhammad a favor in reciprocation of which, he expected
  him to abandon his murderous attacks on the Meccan caravans. But, as history
  tells us, he was dead wrong in his assumptions, for Muhammad continued on his
  path until such time the entire population of the Peninsula surrendered
  themselves to his dictatorial authority for nothing else, but to save their
  lives.<br>
  <br>
  In order to sooth his followers' injured ego, Muhammad attributed their defeat
  to the Will of God. Asked why God did not help them this time with five
  thousand angels from heaven, he told them: &quot;God did this {promised the
  angels} only as good news for you that your hearts might be at rest herein.
  Victory comes only from God, the Mighty the Wise, i.e. I mentioned the armies
  of My angels only as a good news for you and that your hearts might be at rest
  herein, because I know your weakness and victory comes only from Me because of
  My sovereignty and power for the reason that power and authority belong to Me,
  not to any one of my creatures (Ibn Ishaq, op. cit. p. 392).<br>
  <br>
  The aforesaid statement makes it clear: God had no intention to help the
  Muslim fighters, and Muhammad knew it. God made the promise of the angelic
  help only to boost their moral; and they lost their moral when they failed to
  stand firm and wavered in the face of their enemy's onslaught. It did not
  matter to God that the Muslims suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of
  the infidels, for this defeat was intended to teach them a lesson, which would
  prevent them, in future, from doing what they did in the just concluded
  battle.</p>
