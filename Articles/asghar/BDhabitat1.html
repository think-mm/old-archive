                                It was 1973. I was accompanying a friend of mine
                                to Genoa, Italy. He needed my help with the
                                conclusion of an agency agreement with Piaggo
                                and Co. This company was the largest exporter of
                                three wheeler taxis and Vespa scooters to
                                Bangladesh. My friend had been issuing indents
                                on this company for almost a year without an
                                agreement.<br>
                                <br>
                                Bangladesh was still an un-organized country. It
                                did not have any passport to issue to its
                                citizens for travel abroad. On our request, the
                                Immigration Department issued us two
                                “chardpatras” (permits) to facilitate our
                                journey. We applied to Bangladesh Bank, and it
                                permitted us to carry ten English Pounds (five
                                for each) in traveler’s check to cover our
                                entire journey from Bangladesh to Genoa, via New
                                Delhi, and return.<br>
                                <br>
                                After landing in Rome one fine morning, we went
                                to the immigration counter. The officer glanced
                                at our chardpatras; let a faint smile creep up
                                on his face; cast a cursory look at our faces;
                                picked up his official seal; affixed it to our
                                chardpatras and waved us in. At the custom
                                counter, the officer took a look at our
                                chardpatras, and signaled us out of the custom
                                hall.<br>
                                <br>
                                My friend and I compared the scrutiny we were
                                subjected to at New Delhi Airport with the one
                                we were given at Rome and concluded that,
                                perhaps, it was the way in which the Italians
                                treated their foreign guests. (In Delhi, it was
                                different; we were given a special treatment, as
                                we looked like Indians!).<br>
                                <br>
                                Our business over, we decided to reroute our
                                tickets (first class, provided by Piaggo and
                                Co.) so that we could go around the world before
                                returning to Bangladesh. The Rome office of Air
                                India was kind; it issued us two new economic
                                class tickets that covered London, Stockholm,
                                Tokyo via Alaska, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Dhaka
                                (at that time, it was Decca). We had to pay a
                                few hundred Dollars for rerouting our tickets
                                (thanks to Piaggo; it let my friend collect his
                                outstanding commission from them in US Dollars).<br>
                                <br>
                                We reached Heathrow one late evening by an
                                Alitalia flight. The officer at the immigration
                                counter was a young man, and he had never seen,
                                so it seemed, chardpatras before in his life. He
                                questioned us for about forty-five minutes to
                                make sure that we were genuine travelers and
                                that we had enough money to cover our expenses.
                                After being satisfied, he quipped: I thought
                                that the people of Bangladesh were very poor
                                whom we have been helping with our aid and
                                grants. But I see you two gentlemen are rich.
                                How come?<br>
                                <br>
                                Incensed by his ignorant and impolite remark, I
                                retorted: Officer, you or your country is giving
                                nothing to our country. What your country had
                                taken out from the Indian sub-continent during
                                your occupation of our lands, your country has
                                been paying it back in easy installments. We are
                                allowing you to do so, as we are a kind people.
                                If we had insisted on a one-time return of
                                everything your country had taken out of our
                                lands, your country would have gone bankrupt a
                                long time ago.<br>
                                <br>
                                Thus expressing my anger, I looked up at his
                                face; it was red and his eyes moist. Without
                                saying anything further, he chopped our
                                chardpatras, with permission to stay in England
                                for three months.<br>
                                <br>
                                At Stockholm, we sailed through immigration and
                                customs, without being asked a single question.
                                In Tokyo, the young female immigration officer
                                had failed, perhaps, to recognize our
                                chardpatras, but she resolved her problem after
                                having a consultation with one of her colleagues
                                without letting us know the nature of problem
                                she had with our document.<br>
                                <br>
                                Hong Kong and Bangkok welcomed us with open
                                arms. Though our chardpatras had created a
                                little ripple at Hong Kong, immigration officers
                                at Bangkok appeared very familiar with them,
                                thanks to Patpong and other “tourist
                                attractions,” which must have had motivated
                                many neo-rich Bangladeshis to visit Thailand in
                                order to help rid this formerly poor Buddhist
                                country of its grinding poverty.<br>
                                <br>
                                After my first overseas visit in 1973, I kept on
                                visiting most of the far-eastern countries, I do
                                not know for how many times. At Narita of Japan
                                and Kimpo of Seoul, I needed no visas; my green
                                passport was enough to let me enter these two
                                countries without any hindrance whatsoever. The
                                same was the situation with Bangkok and Hong
                                Kong; I spent only so much time at the airports
                                as was necessary for me to reach the immigration
                                and custom counters.<br>
                                <br>
                                The situation changed when Bangladesh decided to
                                impose visa restrictions on the people of Japan
                                and Korea. Both these countries retaliated in
                                kind, but remained lukewarm in implementing
                                their new immigration laws in respect to the
                                people of Bangladesh.<br>
                                <br>
                                Bangladesh, though never a destination of great
                                attraction, became very serious in seeing that
                                all Japanese and Koreans followed its visa
                                requirements. In its zest to prevail, Dhaka
                                Airport was instructed not to let the people of
                                these two countries enter Bangladesh, unless
                                they had obtained visas prior to their arrival.<br>
                                <br>
                                A group of Japanese investors fell victim to
                                Dhaka’s whimsical law; Zia’s immigration
                                department refused to let them in as they had
                                arrived without visas, though there existed, I
                                believe, a provision for the visitors without
                                visas, to get temporary visas on arrival at the
                                Airport on payment of a certain amount of fee.<br>
                                <br>
                                The Japanese remained confined at the airport
                                for a number of hours. They could walk out of
                                their confinement only after the Japanese
                                Embassy came forward, and prevailed on the
                                authority to let them go with one of its high
                                officials.<br>
                                <br>
                                The Japanese went to a hotel in Dhaka, relaxed
                                in it during the night and then left for
                                Bangkok, the next morning with a vow never to
                                come to Dhaka again.<br>
                                <br>
                                Japan did not take the humiliation of its people
                                kindly; it also put into operation its own
                                immigration restrictions on the Bengalees. They
                                could no more enter Japan as easily as it was
                                possible in the past. Its Embassy in Dhaka
                                checked stringently the bona fides of all the
                                Bangladeshi visa applicants, who wanted to visit
                                Japan. Even those, like myself, who had been to
                                this country a number of times in the past faced
                                difficulties in obtaining visas; this despite
                                the fact that they provided satisfactory proofs
                                to justify their visit to Japan on business and
                                other important considerations.<br>
                                <br>
                                While Japan was tightening its visa rules on the
                                Bangladeshi people, Bangladesh Biman opened its
                                flight to Kyoto. Over two hundred Bangladeshi
                                ‘businessmen’ were scheduled to travel by
                                its inaugural flight. The Federation of Chamber
                                and Commerce requested, and the Japanese Embassy
                                issued visas to all of them. They traveled to
                                Kyoto, but none of them returned to Dhaka.<br>
                                <br>
                                Press reports had it that each one of the
                                stowaways had paid the President of the
                                Federation a large sum of money for the help he
                                gave them in obtaining visas from the Japanese
                                Embassy. When the Biman guests did not return
                                home, the Embassy became furious. Failing to
                                punish the President of the Federation for his
                                fraudulent act, the Embassy satisfied itself by
                                barring him for life from approaching its
                                premises in Dhaka.<br>
                                <br>
                                Even though Biman was claiming that the “world
                                was becoming smaller,” in fact, many countries
                                of it were becoming out of reach of the people
                                of Bangladesh. Middle-Eastern countries were
                                sending back many of them who had gone their on
                                employment. Others stopped hiring them
                                altogether.<br>
                                <br>
                                Bangladeshis, therefore, began looking for other
                                venues where they could find employments,
                                legally or illegally. Their desperate search for
                                means of livelihood took them to Singapore,
                                Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South
                                Korea. Many went to these countries as
                                businessmen, and stayed back after taking up
                                jobs in factories and other establishments,
                                which needed them for meeting the shortage of
                                menial workers from among their own people.
                                Others entered those countries through illegal
                                routes, thus creating problems for those
                                countries’ law enforcement agencies.<br>
                                <br>
                                Frustrated, most of the Far East and South
                                Eastern countries shut down their doors on the
                                Bangladeshis; even Singapore, generally a
                                liberal country in respect to tourists, imposed
                                embargo on the visa-free entry of we Bengalees
                                into this country. Bengalees are now being
                                required by the tourist-friendly Thailand to
                                obtain their visas before arriving in Bangkok.<br>
                                <br>
                                According to a recent press report, over ten
                                thousand Bangladeshis have been lingering in
                                Malaysian jails for a long time. Some were
                                caught in Laos, while trying to proceed to
                                Japan. At least seven Bangladeshis were dumped
                                on Jordan-Iraq border by their agent, who was
                                responsible to take them to somewhere else in
                                the Middle East with the promise of providing
                                them with jobs.<br>
                                <br>
                                Jordanian police helped them out of the danger
                                that loomed over their head in Iraq. What
                                happened to these unfortunate men later is not
                                within my knowledge.<br>
                                <br>
                                There was a time when many hotels in Bangkok
                                would not check-in visitors from Bangladesh
                                without first taking a deposit; hospitals would
                                not treat them without receiving the estimated
                                cost of their treatment.<br>
                                <br>
                                The Thai people had to adopt the above
                                precautionary measures, because many
                                Bangladeshis, including the well-to-do folks
                                among them, left their hotel rooms and hospital
                                beds without paying their bills.<br>
                                <br>
                                Those of our compatriots who failed to enter the
                                territories of the countries, named above, they
                                traveled through land to Turkey and then tried
                                to cross into Greece during winter, when the
                                Greek guards remain less alert on their borders.
                                Many Bangladeshis lost their toes and noses to
                                frost bites, for the reason that they had failed
                                to make a living in the country of their birth.<br>
                                <br>
                                At this stage of my narrative, I need to digress
                                from my main theme in order to assure readers
                                that what I have stated above, or am about to
                                write below, are not intended to cast aspersion
                                on Bangladesh, nor is it my intention to make
                                light of the struggles many of its unfortunate
                                people are forced to undertake in order to
                                survive in our cruel world. Through this write
                                up, I intend to point out where the so-called
                                leaders of Bangladesh have led the country to,
                                and also to remind readers of how the ruling
                                elites and their cohorts have steadily been
                                making the lives of its common people
                                unbearable.<br>
                                <br>
                                South Korea was once one of the poorest
                                countries in the Far East. It is today a rising
                                star, drawing admiration even from its former
                                distracters. If we were to compare its economic
                                conditions with that of Bangladesh of 1970s, I
                                can say without hesitation that South Korea did
                                not have much appreciable advantage over
                                Bangladesh. But today, South Korea has not only
                                left Bangladesh much behind in its march to
                                advancement and progress, it has also become one
                                of the much sought-after destinations for many
                                overseas job seekers of Bangladesh.<br>
                                <br>
                                A little consideration of what I was once told
                                by one of the South Korean Ambassadors to Dhaka
                                should help readers know the main cause for
                                Bangladesh’s ever deteriorating situation.<br>
                                <br>
                                Asked to compare his country’s situation with
                                that of Bangladesh, he had told me: My country
                                is one of the most corrupt countries of the
                                world. You cannot do much in Korea without
                                paying something to someone for doing something
                                for you. But we Koreans take precautions in
                                certain matters: we do not receive bribes, nor
                                are expected to pay bribes in those cases where
                                we know paying and receiving bribes are going to
                                harm our common interests. For example, we avoid
                                taking bribes in projects like building roads
                                and sub-ways. We all know that all of us have to
                                use them in our daily lives. Since indulgence in
                                corruption is not likely to produce a good and
                                strong road or sub-way, we try our best to keep
                                sectors like these two out of our culture of
                                bribe.<br>
                                <br>
                                But my long stay in Bangladesh, as well as my
                                dealings with many officials of your country has
                                made on thing very clear to me and that is this:
                                Many among them do not accept even aid or grants
                                for the poor people of your country without
                                first receiving their share of bribes.<br>
                                <br>
                                Above was a revelation that has been boggling my
                                mind for over twenty years. I have tried to
                                verify the Ambassador’s remarks, but could not
                                make any headway, as I did not have right
                                connections in the Government of Bangladesh.<br>
                                <br>
                                Transparency International Bangladesh confirmed
                                what the Korean Ambassador had told me a long
                                time ago. In a study entitled “Endemic
                                Corruption in Bangladesh” released recently,
                                it said that at least 75 percent of foreign aid
                                received by Bangladesh does not reach its
                                intended target because of corruption (source:
                                The Daily Times of Pakistan).<br>
                                <br>
                                This explains why the majority of the people of
                                Bangladesh are so poor, despite the fact that
                                their country is the recipient of a large amount
                                of foreign aid, and also when each one of them
                                owes today approximately 28 US Dollars in loan
                                to foreign countries and International Lending
                                Agencies.<br>
                                <br>
                                The “sarkari kormokartas (literally, officers
                                appointed by the government to boss over the
                                people) are not the only beneficiaries of the
                                plunder; many businessmen, especially the elite
                                ones, also get their share of it, through their
                                collaborative efforts. If not all, but most of
                                the projects, such as the laying of gas pipe
                                lines, construction of power stations, building
                                of bridges like the one over the Jamuna River,
                                and the contracts for exploration of gas in the
                                country etc. have local agents to represent
                                their foreign principals. They help their
                                principals with the negotiation of their deals
                                with the government.<br>
                                <br>
                                Most often, agents negotiate the amount of bribe
                                to be paid to the concerned officers of the
                                government. The lesser amount they are able to
                                negotiate for payment, the higher income they
                                derive from the projects for themselves.
                                Representing foreign principals has been, and
                                still remains a highly lucrative business for
                                many businessmen of Bangladesh. Consequently,
                                most of them have never tried to develop local
                                resources or expertise for the execution of
                                projects that are essential for the development
                                and progress and wellbeing of Bangladesh.<br>
