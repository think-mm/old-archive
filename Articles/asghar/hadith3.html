                                  Many humans consider lying to be a despicable 
                                  act. To prevent the remainder of them from 
                                  lying, some nations have enacted laws with a 
                                  view to punishing them for their lies. In the 
                                  United States, liars are punished by 
                                  imprisonment. Yet, many Americans do not 
                                  hesitate to lie, if it is likely to bring them 
                                  power, monetary gains and the accolades and 
                                  respect of their families and societies. &nbsp;</p>

                                  petty thieves do the same for the same reason. 
                                  There are many others who, though appear to 
                                  have gentle and attractive countenances, feel 
                                  no qualm in using the venom of their lies, 
                                  when the use of it is likely to destroy their 
                                  real and perceived enemies. </p>

                                  The severity of lies depends on the magnitude 
                                  of success that lies are expected to bring to 
                                  the liars. Therefore, the world has seen a 
                                  large number of both small and big liars ever 
                                  since humans started walking on earth’s 
                                  surface. It would continue to hold liars on 
                                  its bosom until the time it disappears from 
                                  the solar system of our universe.</p>

                                  themselves, they also succeeded in enslaving a 
                                  large number of mankind by combining lies with 
                                  their power of manipulation. In support of my 
                                  statement, I cite a few examples of lies, 
                                  which had been impacting our lives from the 
                                  time humans began treating those lies, not as 
                                  lies, but as truths. </p>

                                  over their fellow religionists, they concocted

                                  Allah (God in English) spoke in person on the

                                  Some 2,000 years ago, when another group of 
                                  manipulative people wished to subject the Jews 
                                  to their rule, they had a virgin girl given 
                                  birth to a son, who is now known as Jesus 
                                  Christ. In his manhood, this son of a virgin 
                                  mother, rightly claiming that he was a “Son of 
                                  God,” declared that many of the things the 
                                  Jews had been doing for ages were wrong and 
                                  that he was sent by his Father to set them on 
                                  the path of righteousness and honorable 
                                  living. He wore the mantle of a religious 
                                  reformer to seize power from the rabbis, and 
                                  to declare himself the King of the Jews, if he 
                                  succeeded with his ploy. </p>

                                  securing, for him, a death sentence, which was

                                  from the desert of Arabia to shackle a large

                                  Islam. Since he lacked the credentials of

                                  ‘unimaginable’ to happen to him so that he 
                                  could set himself above all the so-called

                                  wife for sometime, Muhammad was sleeping one

                                  Allah had endowed them. They are known to have

                                  From the above historical references, it 
                                  becomes crystal clear that at the time, 
                                  Muslims believe, Muhammad had landed in 
                                  Jerusalem on his way to the 7<sup>th</sup> 
                                  heaven, there existed no mosque on the hill of 
                                  Moriah. It could not have existed there then, 
                                  because in 620 A.D., Islam was still in its 
                                  cradle; its tranquilizing fangs still 
                                  remaining un-developed, and the sword it 
                                  needed to expand its influence throughout the 
                                  earth still sheathed. </p>

                                  The truth being the above, Muslims need to ask 
                                  themselves: Why the Quran says that there 
                                  existed a mosque in Jerusalem in 620 A.D., 
                                  when there was no possibility for one to be 
                                  built, and maintained, by the Muslims on the 
                                  face of a Jew-dominated land? </p>

                                  The truth lies in the fact that Muhammad had 
                                  never traveled to Jerusalem on the back of a 
                                  woman, having the body of a horse; that he 
                                  never ascended to the seventh heaven 
                                  corporeally and that he made up the story of a 
                                  mysterious journey to fool his Companions on 
                                  the question they had raised on his 
                                  whereabouts during the night he was spending 
                                  in the company of his cousin, Umm Hani. This 
                                  was the greatest lie ever spoken by a man; 
                                  without it, Islam would have died its natural 
                                  death a long, long time ago. And without 
                                  Islam, the earth would have remained much 
                                  better a place for all humans to live together 
                                  in peace and harmony.</p>
