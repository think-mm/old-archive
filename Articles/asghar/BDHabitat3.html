                                Many Bangladeshis who take up menial jobs in 
                                distant lands in order to support their families 
                                back home often become victims of their 
                                employers. Even after being subjected 
                                continually to brutal treatments, especially by 
                                their Middle Eastern employers, who are infamous 
                                for their intolerance and violation of all human 
                                rights, most Bangladeshi expatriates cling to 
                                their jobs, as quitting them and returning to 
                                Bangladesh are recipes, which can destroy their 
                                and their families’ well-being for good.</p>

                                male counterparts. They are not only used as 
                                domestic slaves, many of them also become 
                                victims of their male masters’ sexual lusts. 
                                Yet, many Bangladeshi women are not afraid to 
                                brave such hazards, for, being physically and

                                What I have stated above is not a secret; even 
                                the Middle Eastern Medias do not hesitate in 
                                pointing out the behavior of some of their own 
                                people. Here is a report that appeared in the 
                                Arab News of July 24, 2004 for readers to read:
                                </p>

                                “What a human rights organization said about the 
                                abusive treatment of laborers in Saudi Arabia 
                                deserves contemplation and appreciation, 
                                regardless of the fact that some news media 
                                limited themselves to mentioning only Saudi 
                                Arabia though the situation and problem are 
                                similar in other countries in the region.</p>

                                Even though the report by the New York-based 
                                Human Rights Watch released on July 15 may be 
                                unacceptable to some here in the Kingdom, 
                                especially among influential classes, we all 
                                must take notice and take a stand.</p>

                                The trade in foreign servants and laborers has 
                                reached a stage almost equivalent to slavery. 
                                The slave trade originates in many cases in 
                                expatriate worker’s home countries where 
                                unscrupulous individuals collect huge amounts of 
                                money from poor job seekers in exchange for a 
                                job and work visa.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                In the Kingdom, similar “slave trade” companies 
                                collect such large sums of money from the 
                                imported laborer that nothing is left for him. 
                                These poor people have come to Saudi Arabia in 
                                search of the means to provide the daily bread 
                                for their families back home. But they are often 
                                left struggling for survival and remain at the 
                                mercy of their employer.</p>

                                The stories are horrific and embarrassing, 
                                detailing the transformation of those who came 
                                as laborers into beggars on the streets, jobless 
                                and with no means for a living. Some are 
                                fortunate enough to collect a hundred dollars a 
                                month, a pathetic amount for most of us, but to 
                                the desperately poor, food for their loved 
                                ones.”</p>

                                Readers need to be reminded that the above 
                                report does not speak of sexual abuse of the 
                                female slaves, and of the employment of young 
                                children for use in camel races. </p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                A reader who reads newspapers must know that the 
                                Arabs are very fond of camel racing, on which 
                                they stake huge amount of money. In order to 
                                ensure win for their camels, they tie up young 
                                children to the camels’ backs; when the children 
                                scream in fear, camels run faster, thus 
                                increasing the chances of their win.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                Though many innocent children help the camels 
                                win, but in so doing, many of them end up losing 
                                their own lives. To the God-fearing Arabs, the 
                                loss of lives by the innocent young children is 
                                not a big deal; what matters most to them is the 
                                big win they bring to them at the cost of their 
                                own lives!</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                Though some of the Arab governments are reported 
                                to have taken steps to ban the use of young 
                                children as “baits” in camel races of their 
                                countries, yet this practice is thought to be 
                                rampant in some of the remote areas of the 
                                Middle East. When God would condescend to spare 
                                the lives of the helpless children is something 
                                that only He knows; only thing that I can say at 
                                this stage of our human history is this: despite 
                                trying His best to turn His “selected people, 
                                into humans, He has failed to achieve His 
                                desired goal. He would need to send another 
                                Prophet to them, and only, perhaps, then, all of 
                                His selected people would know how they should 
                                respect the lives of those children, men and 
                                women, who come to them not in search of death, 
                                but bread. </p>

                                hungry millions, as He had done in the time of 
                                Jesus Christ (cf. Quran; 5:115 to 118). Is He 
                                willing to do either of the two in order to 
                                prove that He is really kind and caring for the

                                In the early part of 1990, the coastal belt of 
                                Chittagong was hit hard by a devastating cyclone 
                                and tidal surge. Thousands of people lost their 
                                lives. Others who had survived their God’s wrath 
                                found themselves in a different world, with 
                                their homes, personal belongings and cattle-head 
                                washed into the Bay of Bengal.</p>

                                I owned a Container Yard at the Katghor area of 
                                the city. Cyclone and the tidal surge had turned 
                                it into a wreck. Strong cyclonic wind and high 
                                waves of the water surge carried to, and 
                                deposited a few containers at locations that 
                                were almost two miles away from my container

                                the Container Yard. The Patenga Diversion Road 
                                was almost deserted. All of a sudden, we saw a 
                                motorcade proceeding to the city from the 
                                Katghor direction. In one of the vehicles was 
                                riding Begum Khaleda Zia. We were able to see 
                                her face, when her vehicle, with its windows 
                                rolled down, passed by our stationary car. </p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                As the convoy of cars was moving, a man, only 
                                with a torn lungi on his body, decided to cross 
                                the road. No sooner had he reached its centre, 
                                the front car of the convoy knocked him down. 
                                While the badly injured man was twisting and 
                                squirming with pain by the side of the road, all 
                                the vehicles in the motorcade passed by him 
                                without even stopping for a while to find out 
                                what had happened to that ill-fated man. &nbsp;</p>

                                injured man, another car (unrelated to the 
                                motorcade) stopped at the spot where the injured 
                                man was lying; its riders lifted him onto its 
                                backseat and sped away. &nbsp;</p>

                                Perhaps, oblivion was his fate: It erased out 
                                his existence without letting the world ever 
                                know how he had become a victim of a group of 
                                people he must have taken, in his lifetime, to 
                                be his protector and savior! </p>

                                incident came back to our mind, and replayed 
                                itself again and again. How painful it was, only 
                                a sufferer can say. For those who are used to 
                                such happenings in their lives, it was a 
                                trifling matter that requires neither a

                                motorcade, are insignificant. Why should they

                                of mine had once made during one of our 
                                philosophical discussions. He held the view that 
                                a nation that does not know how to value its own 
                                wealth, it does not deserve to have or be given 
                                any wealth. Give a gold mine to an ignorant 
                                nation, and it would end up destroying it in a 
                                short time. An example might be appropriate

                                advantage of this lacking, most housewives do 
                                not turn off the burners of their cookers, as
