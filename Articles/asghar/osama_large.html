text-indent:.2in">a. Unlike Osama, Saddam was an ordinary-looking Iraqi.</p>

text-indent:.2in">b. During his 35-year rule over his country, he had made a lot
                                of people subservient to him and to his needs.
                                Apart from his Republican Guards, there were
                                many civilians who were willing not only to
                                protect him from harm; they were also prepared
                                to die for his sake, when he was in power. This
                                statement of mine should not be taken to imply
                                that he was free from enemies; in fact, a vast
                                majority of Iraqis wanted him dead, but without
                                any ability to go against him and his tyrannical
                                regime.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">c. According to information we have, Saddam had much more
                                resources at his disposal to buy protection with
                                from some of the people of <st1:country-region>
                                <st1:place>
                                Iraq</st1:place>
                                </st1:country-region>
                                in order to avoid his capture by the American
                                forces than Osama is or was able to spend on his
                                and his followers’ protection.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">If what I have stated in the above alphabetized paragraphs is
                                true, then the question arises: Why the
                                Americans have failed so far to catch Osama,
                                when they were able to catch Saddam Hussain in a
                                relatively short time, with a degree of ease?</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">The answer to the question lies in two different scenarios.
                                One relates to Saddam: Though he dispensed
                                numerous favors to a large number of the Iraqi
                                people when he was in power, he failed to win
                                their sympathy and following due to his brutal
                                actions of the past. In fact, most of the Iraqis
                                hated him from the core of their hearts.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">Therefore, when he fell from power, and was being hunted by
                                the American forces, even his former Iraqi
                                sycophants refused to provide him shelter and
                                protection he was desperately in need of. Even
                                when he had nowhere to hide himself in, but a
                                foxhole, his lone companion betrayed him for 25
                                million dollars the Americans had offered on his
                                head.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">The second scenario relates to Osama bin Laden: Unlike Saddam
                                Hussain, Osama is a hero for a greater number of
                                Muslims. They believe that in collusion with the
                                Jews, the Christian world is after them, and
                                that the enemies of Islam want to destroy it by
                                force. This perception brought them closer to
                                Osama, and in him, they see the survival of
                                their religion.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">Consequently, Osama is a soldier of Islam for those Muslims
                                amidst whom he might be hiding himself now.
                                Driven by their religious belief, they must be
                                providing him not only with shelter; they may
                                also be providing him with everything he and the
                                members of his entourage need in their daily
                                life.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">This scenario explains why the American satellites, drones and
                                other spying methods have failed so far to
                                detect Osama’s whereabouts. I believe he has
                                been living among his Muslim admirers, thus
                                making his exposure to prying eyes unnecessary.
                                Until they give him up, or refuse to meet his
                                daily needs, it would be very difficult, and
                                risky, for his American pursuers to apprehend
                                him some time in days ahead.</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.2in">How about the containment of the jihadi movement of the
                                Muslims? I will deal with this explosive issue
                                in my next article.</p>
