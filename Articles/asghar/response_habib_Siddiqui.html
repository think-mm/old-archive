                              I read <a href="http://www.bangladesh-web.com/news/sep/20/g20092003.htm#A1">Dr.
                              Siddiqui's article as published by News From
                              Bangladesh in its issue of September 20, 2003</a>
                              with great interest. The contents of his rejoinder
                              establish the fact that the learned writer is
                              upset and angry at those whom he called
                              &quot;bigots,&quot; &quot;ill-informed,&quot;
                              dyslexic,&quot; &quot;mentally deranged,&quot;
                              &quot;paranoid&quot; and &quot;vindictive&quot;
                              etc. for writing something that concerned the life
                              of Muhammad and the religion he founded some
                              fourteen hundred years ago. I can understand Dr.
                              Siddiqui's outburst, for, the claims made by some
                              modern writers and thinkers have shattered his
                              deeply held beliefs to live with which, he has
                              neither the courage nor the mental aptitude, hence
                              his diatribes against the alleged blasphemers of
                              his faith.<br>
                              <br>
                              In his rage, Dr. Siddiqui also took the Editorial
                              Board of the News From Bangladesh to task for
                              publishing those articles, which he thinks are
                              offensive to Muslims and their beliefs. In other
                              words, the writer desires that the Website should
                              exercise some sort of censorship in order to
                              prevent certain facts, both solid and
                              circumstantial, from surfacing at a time when the
                              people of the world are trying their best to
                              investigate and rectify the mistakes of their
                              ancestors. This attitude on Dr. Siddiqui's part
                              appeared strange to me, for, he wants to
                              decapitate a source that has been providing great
                              service to a mass of humanity by adopting a
                              liberal policy without which, it could never have
                              satisfied its thirst for knowledge. I highly
                              commend NFB for its bold and objective journalism.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Siddiqui has claimed in his rejoinder that
                              Muslims are tolerant, hence the bigots' ability to
                              go unscathed even after abusing all the Muslims of
                              the Indian subcontinent. I do not condone abuse,
                              and as I have not read the alleged abuses, I do
                              not know how to respond to his above claim, except
                              to point out one probable scenario: Had the
                              Bengali-speaking Hindu from Advani's India
                              unleashed his alleged abuses on the Muslims in
                              person, instead of having them published by NFB, I
                              can assure Dr. Siddiqui that Muslims would have
                              cut him into pieces first and then ask him
                              questions on his alleged behavior. Having said
                              that, I want to give a few examples of Muslim
                              tolerance:</p>
                              <blockquote>
                                <p align="left"><br>
                                1.A Pakistani Muslim physician tells his
                                students that Muhammad was not a Muslim until he
                                received, at the age of forty, his first
                                so-called &quot;wohi&quot; or revelation from
                                God. To the Muslims, his true statement was
                                blasphemous; so they put him on trial and then
                                condemned him to a life-term imprisonment. This
                                is one example of Muslims' tolerance towards
                                their own Muslim brothers.<br>
                                <br>
                                2. Muslims in India have the right to call
                                believers to prayers over loudspeakers before
                                dawn by disturbing the ailing non-believers'
                                sleep as well as on four other occasions each
                                day. But Hindus in many parts of
                                Muslim-dominated Bangladesh cannot beat their
                                drums when performing their Puja on the ground
                                that the sound of the drums distracted the
                                Muslims from their prayers. This is the second
                                example of tolerance exhibited by the Muslims
                                towards their Hindu compatriots.<br>
                                <br>
                                3. Hindus revere cows. Therefore, they neither
                                kill them nor eat their meat. Despite the
                                prohibition followed by the Hindus, Muslims,
                                living in a Hindu-dominated India, regularly
                                slaughter cows and sell beef in many open
                                markets. Can Dr. Siddiqui visualize what would
                                have happened if the Muslims revered the cows
                                and the Hindus slaughtered them for their meat?<br>
                                <br>
                                4. Muslims invaded India and then became its
                                rulers. When their number swelled, they forced
                                the British to truncate India on the ground that
                                they needed a country of their own where they
                                could practice their Islamic faith without fear
                                of the Hindus. Unsatisfied with the division of
                                India, many Muslims who still live on its soil
                                profess their allegiance to Pakistan and feel
                                proud when Pakistan gains an upper hand over
                                India; the same people felt distressed and
                                mourned when India defeated Pakistan at Cargil.
                                Had the Hindus done the same thing in Pakistan,
                                can Dr. Siddiqui say what would have happened to
                                them in the overwhelmingly Muslim-dominated
                                Pakistan?<br>
                                <br>
                                5. In the Christian-dominated countries of the
                                world, Christians convert to Islam or to other
                                religions without fear of any retaliation or
                                repression from their relatives or neighbors.
                                For example, we have Cats Steven who converted
                                to Islam a few years ago. He is now known as
                                Yusuf Islam. I have not heard or read a single

                                Siddiqui certify that Muslims would treat him at
                                par with Cats Steven if he converted to
                                Christianity and attempted to live among his

                              <br>
                              It is true that 9/11 has offered many people an
                              opportunity to talk about what they felt for a
                              long time about Islam and its so-called celestial
                              doctrines. Had not those nineteen brutal and
                              bestial Muslims killed over three thousand people
                              and destroyed properties worth billions of Dollars
                              on that fateful day, the world would still have
                              believed that the Muslims were a peace-loving
                              people and would have looked the other way if a
                              Muslim Ayatollah had ordered the bigoted Muslims
                              to murder those who spoke up their minds.
                              Following the aftermath of 9/11, the world has
                              changed; the Mullahs and Ayatollahs can no more do
                              what they did to Salman Rushdie many years ago for
                              writing a fictional book, the plot of which he had
                              adopted from the pages of Islamic history. The
                              unveiling of the Muslim face is now acting as a
                              shield for those of us who have the courage to say
                              or write what we believe is true; otherwise, we
                              would have faced certain death in the hands of
                              those who call themselves &quot;the Soldiers of
                              God.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              In my reckoning, the massage parlors and
                              whorehouses of Bangkok are better places for women
                              than what God has ordained for the hapless Muslim
                              women. In Bangkok, one enjoys sex with the Thai
                              prostitutes against payment and in a humanly
                              manner; in the Muslim harems, Muslim men can have
                              sex with their women in any manner and in any
                              position they liked. God permitted Muslim men not
                              only to rape their women; they also have the right
                              to sodomize them (Quran; 2:222 &amp; 223), if that
                              is what it takes to satisfy their sexual appetite.<br>
                              <br>
                              The position that Islam accords to slave-girls is
                              worse than the whores of Bangkok. Without marrying
                              them or without having to pay them any
                              compensation, God allowed Muslim men to have sex
                              with them whenever and however they liked it. The
                              sexual pleasures that Muslim men are permitted to
                              derive from the slave-girls did not leave God
                              unaffected; he unashamedly reserved for himself a
                              share of the human booty (Quran; 8:41), which he
                              himself promised to bestow upon his soldiers
                              should they succeed in taking over the ownership
                              of young girls and women after killing, in his
                              holy name, their infidel fathers, brothers and
                              husbands.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Siddiqui inferred that I am a spineless and
                              gutless person and as such, I write under the
                              fictitious name of Mohammad Asghar. Presuming that
                              Dr. Siddiqui is a Bangladeshi, I urge him to
                              verify my identity through a simple effort:
                              Contact any person who is involved with shipping
                              business in Bangladesh and find out from him if a
                              person by the name of Mohammad Asghar had existed
                              just a few years ago in their midst or not. After
                              saying that for myself, I ask Dr. Siddiqui to
                              prove his own identity; give me a referral that
                              would certify that Dr. Siddiqui is not a
                              fictitious name or a pseudonym and that he has not
                              been fooling the readers with the addition of the
                              word &quot;Dr.&quot; before his name.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Siddiqui is furious over what I wrote in my
                              article, &quot;Muhammad and Islam-Stories not told
                              before&quot; regarding Amina's conception and the
                              birth of the Prophet of Islam. His position is
                              that that since no biographer of the Prophet had
                              ever hinted at what I wrote in my &quot;untold
                              story,&quot; he is unwilling to accept my claim
                              without seeing its source. Before stating my
                              argument for his consideration, I would like him
                              to answer two simple questions: What source will
                              he be depending on to prove that Muhammad had
                              visited Jerusalem and from there, he ascended to
                              the seventh heaven to meet God? Was Jerusalem
                              supposed to have a &quot;mosque&quot; at the time
                              Muhammad is believed to have said his prayer in
                              it, before undertaking his night journey to the
                              Throne of God?<br>
                              <br>
                              Now, coming back to the contentious issue that
                              relates to Amina's conception and the birth of
                              Muhammad, let us consider the factors that must
                              have caused the child's transfer to Haleema's
                              custody.<br>
                              <br>
                              According to Dr. Siddiqui, Amina was conscious of
                              a light that illumined her womb during her
                              pregnancy; that she was the bearer of the lord of
                              Arabia and also that her womb told her to name the
                              baby Muhammad upon his birth. Then one day, she
                              delivered her baby.<br>
                              <br>
                              Casting aside the significance of the light she
                              had within her womb and forgetting the yet-to-be
                              proven miraculous qualities of her newborn baby,
                              she refrains from suckling him. When she realizes
                              that the baby is extremely hungry and would die if
                              is not fed immediately, she gives him to Thuwaibah,
                              a servant of his uncle Abu Lahab, to breastfeed
                              him for a few days until a long-term arrangement
                              could be made for his nursing (Adil Salahi,
                              Muhammad: Man and Prophet, p. 23).<br>
                              <br>
                              A few days later, a Bedouin woman, by the name of
                              Haleema, shows up at Amina's door. She has no
                              address; no guarantor to certify her
                              trustworthiness and reliability; no relative of
                              her lived in Mecca through whom she could be
                              reached for reclaiming the baby. Having no
                              consideration at all for the return of her blessed
                              son, Amina hands him over to Haleema to be nursed
                              and groomed by her without any compensation.<br>
                              <br>
                              In the backdrop of the above well-established
                              facts, I ask the learned Dr. Siddiqui to answer
                              the following questions:<br>
                              <br>
                              1.Why Amina did not suckle her &quot;beloved&quot;
                              baby upon his birth?<br>
                              <br>
                              2.Would any woman hand over her newborn baby to a
                              stranger even in the United States of America
                              where tracing people is not as impossible as it
                              was in the vast desert of the medieval Arabian
                              Peninsula?<br>
                              <br>
                              Anticipating what Dr. Siddiqui's response to the
                              above question is going to be, I have a follow-up
                              question for him to answer: (a). What were the
                              names of those foster mothers who had suckled and
                              nursed Abu Talib, Abdul Mutallib and Abdullah, the
                              latter being the father of the Prophet of Islam?<br>
                              <br>
                              3. Why did a poor Bedouin woman accept the burden
                              of rearing up a baby without compensation?<br>
                              <br>
                              4. What Amina would have done, if Haleema had
                              never showed up in Mecca with the child?<br>
                              <br>
                              5. What must have motivated Haleema to accept the
                              responsibility of a newborn baby boy when she had
                              one of her own?<br>
                              <br>
                              I have an example, which will illustrate my
                              hypothesis further.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Siddiqui lives in the United States. So he
                              must have read in the newspapers or heard from the
                              television broadcasts that a young mother had
                              recently tried to get rid of her newborn baby boy
                              by dumping him in a dumpster. Does Dr. Siddiqui
                              know why the woman had acted in such a cruel
                              fashion in a country where illegitimacy of a child
                              does not bother anyone and where millions of
                              couples, with or without children, are looking for
                              opportunities to adopt children from as distant a
                              land as is China?&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>
                              The answer to my above question lies in a simple
                              fact: It was hatred and repulsiveness created by
                              the child in his mother's mind that had forced her
                              to dispose him of in a most inhuman manner.
                              Muhammad would most probably have faced the fate
                              of the American baby had not Haleema shown up at
                              the right time and rescued him from the wrath of
                              his mother.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Siddiqui rejected my hypothesis just because,
                              as he believes, I have failed to spell the name of
                              Muhammad's first wife, Khudeija, properly. In this
                              context, I want the learned doctor to know that if
                              an unintentional and insignificant misspelling of
                              a proper name is an infraction, then a Muslim
                              scholar of Saudi Arabian origin must also be
                              charged with the same crime that Dr. Siddiqui
                              thinks I have committed by misspelling the name
                              &quot;Khadijah.&quot;<br>

                              Muhammad. It is titled, Muhammad: Man and Prophet.
                              He wrote Muhammad's first wife's name by putting
                              in two ees between the alphabets D and J (Khadeejah,
                              p. 41), instead of the alphabet I (eye) that Dr.
                              Siddiqui has used in order to come up with the
                              correct spelling of her name.<br>
                              <br>
                              Now my questions to Dr. Siddiqui are: Are you
                              going to reject the scholarly works of Adil Salahi
                              for the simple reason that he has written the name
                              Khadijah or Khudeija with a different spelling?
                              Are you also going to trash the world-acclaimed
                              treatise of Washington Irving, who says that
                              Muhammad's first wife's name was Cadijah (Mahomet
                              And His Associates, p. 36)?<br>
                              <br>
                              While still dealing with the issue of wrong
                              spelling, I wish to draw Dr. Siddiqui's attention
                              to a current and relevant issue. From his
                              criticism of my thesis, it is evident that he has
                              read it with due care and attention. It is my
                              assumption that he must also have paid due
                              attention to the spelling of my name.<br>
                              <br>
                              But the learned Dr. Siddiqui has greatly
                              disappointed me by grossly distorting the spelling
                              and, thereby, the meaning of my family name. He
                              called me &quot;ASHGOR,&quot; instead of ASGHAR.<br>
                              <br>
                              Would Dr. Siddiqui kindly explain why he turned my
                              last name into ASHGOR without having any regard
                              for the literal meaning of my family name? Did he
                              commit this mistake due to his learning disability
                              or is it the result of his blindness?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Siddiqui has asked me as to why my parents had
                              named me Mohammad and also why I have not changed
                              it as yet. The answer to the first part of his
                              question lies in the title of my article; it being
                              that nobody had ever told my parents that Muhammad
                              was a jinxed baby. Had they known this fact at the
                              time I took birth, I am sure they would never have
                              named me after a person who was not only jinxed,
                              but also a fearsome person whose mere presence
                              among his opponents struck them with utmost terror
                              (Quran; 9:56 &amp; 57).<br>
                              <br>
                              The answer to the second part of Dr. Siddiqui's
                              question is this: By the time I was able to grasp
                              the facts that had surrounded Muhammad's birth and
                              his upbringing under Haleema's care, I had already
                              moved to the United States. When I was being
                              interviewed for my American citizenship in the
                              year 2000, I had the opportunity to change my
                              name, but I did not do it, believing that a
                              drastic change in my name would wipe out my entire
                              credit history. I confess I made a blunder then,
                              as a result of which, I am still living with a
                              name, the utterance of which makes many people
                              think twice these days about me and my true
                              intentions.<br>
                              <br>
                              At the end of his rejoinder, Dr. Siddiqui has
                              recommended readers to read books written by Dr.
                              Martin Lings, Javeed Akhter, Karen Armstrong and
                              Prof. R. K. Rao.<br>
                              <br>
                              I have not read the works of Javeed Akhter and
                              Prof. R. K. Rao but I am familiar with some of the
                              scholarly writings of Dr. Martin Lings and Karen
                              Armstrong. No doubt, they have written true things
                              about Muhammad and Islam.<br>
                              <br>
                              In his book, Muhammad, Dr. Martin Lings opined
                              that Muhammad had the virility of twenty men
                              (p.271); therefore, it was impossible for a single
                              woman to satisfy his sexual needs. Can Dr.
                              Siddiqui tell me on which &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;
                              has Dr. Martin relied for the stated information
                              he says are true and reliable?<br>
                              <br>
                              Karen Armstrong, a rabbinical scholar, wrote: It
                              is not surprising that Muhammad found the
                              revelations such an immense strain: not only was
                              he working through to an entirely new political
                              solution for his people, but HE WAS COMPOSING one
                              of the great spiritual and literary classics of
                              all time. (A History of God, p. 140). She also
                              claims &quot;Muhammad made his converts bow down
                              in ritual prayer (salat) twice a day (p.142).<br>
                              <br>
                              I agree with Karen Armstrong's above observations.
                              Is Dr. Siddiqui willing to accept what Karen has
                              mentioned about the origin of the Quran and the
                              daily two Muslim prayers?<br>
