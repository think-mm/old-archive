                              has said so! What a great honor for the nation of

                              adopted for evaluating each of the 100 ladies 
                              before assigning them their ranks. But despite 
                              making my best efforts, I failed to find a 
                              reliable source that could have satisfied my

                              In frustration, I contacted a friend from 
                              Bangladesh and wanted to know from him as to what

                              the Forbes Magazine has said that Begum Khaleda

                              has any relevance to the affairs of the world, and 
                              that, if her powerful position is being harnessed 
                              by other world leaders for the purpose of solving 
                              their nations’ problems.</p>

                              Khaleda Zia is one of the world’s most honorable 
                              women. She was born to a highly respected Muslim 
                              family of Dinajpur on August 15, 1945.&nbsp; It is said 
                              that her auspicious birth had not only proved to 
                              be a boon for her parents; her arrival on earth is 
                              also believed to have changed the life of all the

                              Seeing that their newborn daughter was blessed by 
                              Allah with the beauty of a <i>houri</i> and the 
                              intellect of a prophet, her parents named her 
                              Begum Khaleda, instead of Khaleda Begum. The word 
                              “Begum” is a title that can be given only to a 
                              great lady, who commands respect. It also means a 
                              wife, or the mistress of the house. Her parents 
                              were absolutely right in giving her the title of 
                              Begum: She remained a Begum during the lifetime of 
                              her ‘Shaheed’ husband; she still remains a Begum 
                              for the Bengali people, numbering over 140 
                              million, many among whom not only admire her 
                              greatly for her benevolence, a good number of them 
                              are also prepared to lay down their lives with a 
                              view to ensuring her safety and security. Only 
                              Allah knows what would have happened to her, if 
                              her farsighted parents had not named her Begum 
                              Khaleda!</p>

                              the people of Dinajpur, they always believed that 
                              she was their savior. Seized by a great sense of 
                              respect, they observe her birthday every year with 
                              great reverence. Its importance is surpassed only 
                              by the birthday festivities of Gen. Zia, her 
                              illustrious and martyred husband. But it is not 
                              going to remain as such for long, for Begum 
                              Khaleda Zia is on her way to earning for herself a

                              laying down his life for the sake of his nation; 
                              it is also likely to overshadow the achievements

                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
                              Begum Khaleda did not obtain a degree from the 
                              college, despite remaining a student for five 
                              years, because, being a real prodigy, she knew 
                              very well that degrees played no roles in 
                              mankind’s life. It is your intellect that makes 
                              you successful and not your degrees, and Begum 
                              Khaleda Zia has proved this point to us beyond any 
                              doubt.</p>
                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
                              Undoubtedly, many young people of Bangladesh are 
                              now emulating Begum Khaleda in their lives; like 
                              her, they, too, are studying for years in colleges 
                              and universities, without obtaining degrees. This, 
                              they believe, is good for the country. The less 
                              degrees you obtain, the better chances you have 
                              not to get employed. The less people are employed 
                              the better it is for the country. After all, 
                              Bangladesh is a “Sonardesh.” All of its people do 
                              not need to exert themselves for earning a living. 
                              Is it not what the people of a Sonardesh (a 
                              country loaded with gold) are supposed to do?</p>

                              My friend paused. Mistaking his pause for 
                              conclusion of his discourse, I asked him: But how 
                              does what you have said make Begum Khaleda Zia one 
                              of the most powerful women of the world?</p>

                              My friend thundered: Asghor! Now I understand why

                              happening around you. Do you not know what Begum

                              the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, you fool! She 
                              has at least four Barristers of law, trained in 
                              England, at her disposal to serve her whims and 
                              caprices. Does it not make her a very powerful 
                              woman? He asked me.</p>

                              It does, I said in a low tone. But how does her 
                              ability to employ the Barristers make her one of 
                              the most powerful women of the world? I asked him 
                              in a muted voice.</p>

                              My friend, somewhat cooled down, disclosed: Colin 
                              Powell, said to be one of the most respected 
                              diplomats of the world, says that Bangladesh is a 
                              moderate Muslim country. Chacha {uncle} Thomas 
                              (American Ambassador to Bangladesh) says that 
                              Jamait-e-Islami is a peace-loving political party. 
                              Don’t you know why these two luminaries are giving 
                              a clean bill of health to Bangladesh on the issue 
                              of Islamic activities that have been taking place 
                              in it for quite some time?</p>

                              Taking a deep sigh, my friend confided: It is the

                              makes other world leaders say all the good things 
                              about Bangladesh. They know that Bangladeshi 
                              Muslim extremists have tried to kill the United 
                              Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh. They 
                              know that the Sunni extremists have been trying to 
                              destroy the mosques of the Qadianis. They know 
                              they tried to kill Sk. Hasina, the leader of 
                              opposition, by throwing bombs in her public 
                              meetings. They also know that most of the 
                              Bangladeshi Muslims support Osama Bin Laden, yet 
                              they have never been able to collect their wits 
                              and confront her with these truths. Do you know 
                              why?</p>
                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
                              It is Begum Khaleda Zia’s power, continued my 
                              friend. The world leaders know that they cannot 
                              afford to upset her by being straightforward, lest 
                              it destroys their relationship with her. Even 
                              Collin Powell and Donald Rumsfield had to collect 
                              their tails between their legs and run away from 
                              Dhaka, when the Begum had told them at their face 
                              that she was not going to send her troops to Iraq 
                              in order to help the Americans out of their 
                              quagmire. Is there any other leader in the world, 
                              who could be as brave as the Begum is?</p>

                              friend asked me.</p>

                              Timidly, I said, yes it does. Before he put down

                              his full visage. Perhaps, he was telling to 
                              himself: There is no dearth of asses in the world; 
                              look for one, and you would find thousands. This
