                                  Those wise men of the past were more clever
                                  then their predecessors. One such man, known
                                  to us as Abraham, is believed to have
                                  established a religion that called humans to
                                  worship a single God. In which period of human
                                  history did Abraham exist is not known, but it
                                  is widely believed that he was the founder of
                                  monotheism.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Abraham’s followers, known as Hebrews, are
                                  believed to have lived in Palestine around
                                  1500 B.C. People in the rest of the world,
                                  including those of India, continued to
                                  practice polytheism with all devotions.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The story of the people of the Arabian
                                  Peninsula was, however, a different one.
                                  Although they believed that they were the
                                  descendants of Abraham’s son Ismail, but
                                  they practiced, and nourished polytheism with
                                  all vigor they had at their disposal. Their
                                  opposition of, and the repulsiveness towards,
                                  monotheism emanated from a belief that
                                  convinced them that their progenitor was a
                                  polytheist and, as such, they deemed it to be
                                  their duty to protect their religion even at
                                  the cost of their lives.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  But their resoluteness to preserve their faith
                                  at any cost proved ineffective in the face of
                                  a determined and persistent assault launched
                                  against it by its opponents, and it
                                  disappeared from the soil of the Arabian
                                  Peninsula some fourteen hundred years ago.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  While the Hebrews were practicing monotheism,
                                  a famine struck hard the southern part
                                  Palestine, where poverty had always ruled
                                  supreme. Driven by hunger, most of them left
                                  their homeland and settled down in Egypt’s
                                  Province of Goshen, close to the Nile River.
                                  Others, who were unwilling to undertake the
                                  tortuous journey, relocated themselves in the
                                  northern part of Palestine, thence called
                                  Canaan, as well as Israel. Here, their number
                                  multiplied rapidly. The aborigines of Canaan
                                  appear to have converted to monotheism over a
                                  certain period of time.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  At the time of their migration, dynastical
                                  Pharaohs ruled Egypt. Some of them worshipped
                                  sun and other celestial objects, while others
                                  claimed that they themselves were gods. Living
                                  for a long time among the polytheist
                                  Egyptians, the Hebrews gave up monotheism, and
                                  took to worshipping various gods, as did their
                                  distant ancestors in the land of Canaan.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  For the entire time they lived in Egypt, the
                                  Hebrews remained enslaved to the successive
                                  Pharaohs. They served the Pharaohs’ needs;
                                  built different edifices and performed all
                                  hard works for them by sacrificing their own
                                  lives. They received little or no compensation
                                  for the works they performed, nor were they
                                  appreciated for the artistic and creative
                                  abilities they possessed.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  As life is more precious for every living
                                  being than anything else, the Hebrews
                                  continued to live in Egypt, despite being
                                  subjected to grueling tasks. With the passage
                                  of time, their number became very large.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The Hebrews’ burgeoning number alarmed the
                                  Pharaohs. They rightly believed that if they
                                  continued to increase their number as rapidly
                                  as they were doing, a day might come when the
                                  Hebrews would outnumber the indigenous
                                  Egyptians, thereby upsetting the kingdom’s
                                  demographic composition. This scenario, in its
                                  own turn, had the potential of creating severe
                                  social and economic consequences for the
                                  country’s rulers.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The anticipation of a disaster, likely to
                                  befall Egypt in an unknown future, spurred one
                                  Pharaoh after another to take measures that
                                  were intended to make Egypt free of the
                                  Hebrews.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The measures called for harsher treatment of
                                  the Hebrews. They were also to be harassed not
                                  only by the Pharaohs’ army, but also by the
                                  common Egyptians. They were to be treated like
                                  slaves. Their slave-status made them inferior
                                  to the Egyptians, with the result that
                                  whenever any calamity struck the country,
                                  Hebrews were required to sacrifice themselves
                                  in order to save the lives of their masters.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  While Hebrews of all ages were suffering under
                                  the Egyptians’ yoke, there arose, among
                                  them, some wise men, who knew how to free them
                                  from their shackles. Asked by people of all
                                  tiers to lay out their plan, the wise men
                                  declared: Let us all migrate to Israel where,
                                  they told their audience with the intention of
                                  inducing them to the perilous journey, milk
                                  and honey flowed in abundance. Delighted by
                                  the prospect of living a pain-free and happy
                                  life, all Hebrews decided to leave Egypt under
                                  the leadership of their wise men.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  And most of the Hebrews did leave Egypt one
                                  day. Their wise men, who knew where Israel was
                                  located, led them on their journey. They
                                  walked and walked, and then arrived at the
                                  edge of a marsh that was very wide and deep.
                                  It was located on a stripe that separated the
                                  Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea, with Egypt
                                  in its west and the ancient city of Ailat on
                                  its east.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Having come into existence after the
                                  Hebrews’ migration from Palestine to Egypt,
                                  due to an increase in the level of water of
                                  the Mediterranean Sea, it acted for a long
                                  time as a natural barrier between Egypt and
                                  the land of Palestine (see the map covering
                                  the kingdoms of Israel and Judah of the period
                                  722-586 B.C to note the stripe’s probable
                                  location).<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The marsh presented itself as a great
                                  challenge to the Hebrew travelers, as without
                                  crossing it, it would have been impossible for
                                  all of them to reach their destination.
                                  Greatly disheartened by the enormity of the
                                  obstacle, the Hebrews resigned to their fate,
                                  and pitched tents in its neighborhood, while
                                  their wise men hurdled together to find a
                                  solution of the problem (It seems probable
                                  that a few “enterprising” Hebrews from
                                  Israel, as well as from Palestine, somehow
                                  crossed this marsh and reached Egypt from time
                                  to time, hence some newer breed of Egyptian
                                  Hebrews’ familiarity with the existence of
                                  Israel. They, however, had not anticipated the
                                  seriousness of the problem the marsh posed to
                                  the humans).<br>
                                  <br>
                                  While the Hebrews remained stranded on the
                                  Egyptian side of the marsh, trying to find
                                  ways and means for crossing the water, a
                                  severe earthquake, having its epicenter in the
                                  Mediterranean Sea, struck the area. Under its
                                  tremendous impact, a good quantity of the
                                  marsh’s water spilled over its surrounding
                                  dry land. It caused a flush flood, which
                                  washed away a good number of the Hebrews to
                                  the sea. The rest of the marsh’s water
                                  flowed back into the stirred Mediterranean Sea
                                  to compensate for the water pulled away from
                                  it by the impact of the earthquake<br>
                                  <br>
                                  As a result of the above act of nature, and
                                  the reactions that followed it, the marsh
                                  became almost dry, and this enabled the
                                  Hebrews to cross it on foot, and with ease.
                                  This marsh eventually dried up, and it became
                                  a part of the Sinai desert. (Perhaps, it was
                                  the same stripe that was excavated to create
                                  the Suez Canal in order to connect the
                                  Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, in 1869 A.
                                  D).<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Resuming their march on the other side of the
                                  almost dried-up marsh, some of the Hebrews
                                  settled down in Palestine, which lay on their
                                  route; while the majority had their eyes
                                  fixated on Israel. Enduring all the hurdles
                                  and hardships that their journey entailed,
                                  they eventually reached their destination one
                                  day.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The Hebrews of Israel were not prepared to let
                                  a large number of people settle down on their
                                  land. Nor they knew who they were. Finding
                                  themselves in a difficult and distressing
                                  situation, the Egyptian Hebrews put into use
                                  their knowledge of genealogy. Through its
                                  effective use, they convinced their would-be
                                  hosts that they were, in fact, their cousins
                                  and that in view of their blood connection;
                                  they ought to be given the right to cohabit
                                  Israel together with them.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Accepting the story the Egyptian Hebrews told
                                  them, the Israeli Hebrews allowed them to live
                                  on their land. However, as the former were
                                  polytheists and the latter practiced
                                  monotheism, a bond of brotherhood failed to
                                  grow in these two groups of the long separated
                                  cousins due to irreconcilable differences in
                                  their respective religious doctrines. In fact,
                                  the former’s arrival in Jerusalem laid the
                                  foundation of a traumatic schism that not only
                                  disrupted its citizens’ lives frequently; it
                                  also proved hugely instrumental in changing
                                  the history of the world at a later date.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  As time continued on with its journey, Israel
                                  saw a huge growth in its population. Time
                                  caused its old generations to disappear; in
                                  their place, it installed new ones. It also
                                  helped men develop their brains so that they
                                  could keep pace with its speed.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Developed brains also caused their possessors
                                  to crave for leadership as well as for wealth.
                                  Known to their compatriots as the wise men,
                                  their intelligence helped them create for
                                  themselves such positions in their societies
                                  as were likely to yield them their desired
                                  results. Ultimately, their successes created
                                  in them one of men’s meanest weaknesses,
                                  which we now know by the name of Greed.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Though time brought about a marked change in
                                  the thinking process of the people of Israel,
                                  but it failed to unite most of the Egyptian
                                  polytheists with their monotheist cousins. As
                                  a result, both the polemical groups never
                                  ceased to argue on the varied percepts of
                                  their respective religions. Their arguments
                                  often led them to bloody fights and
                                  skirmishes, thus unsettling the lives of their
                                  entire community.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The wise men observed the situation for some
                                  time, but when the squabbling among the people
                                  appeared to them to be taking a dangerous and
                                  devastating turn, they decided to act. Their
                                  action plan called for converting the
                                  polytheists to monotheism, supposedly founded
                                  by Abraham, some say, approximately 3,500
                                  years ago.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The wise men approached the polytheists, but
                                  they refused to convert. In order to achieve
                                  their goal, the wise men became story-tellers.
                                  They invented a character by the name of
                                  Moses, around whom they weaved all kinds of

                                  fables that are available for us to read today
                                  in the book, called Torah.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Because the new generation of the Egyptian
                                  Hebrews, born and brought up in Israel, had
                                  some faint ideas of how their forefathers were
                                  treated by the Egyptian Pharaohs, and also of
                                  the hazards they endured on their way to their
                                  present homeland, the story-tellers’ fables
                                  that evolved around the character of the
                                  fictitious Moses and the miracles he
                                  supposedly performed to rescue them from the
                                  Pharaoh’s tyrannical clutches had on them
                                  their intended impact.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Their minds and resistance weakened over a
                                  certain period of time by the combined weight
                                  and effects of myth and fear, the polytheists
                                  agreed to convert to monotheism, but declined
                                  to worship the deity the monotheists had been
                                  worshipping for a long time.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The wise men resolved the problem by inventing
                                  a new deity, whose name was Jehovah. He
                                  appeared unto Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, by the
                                  name of God Almighty, but it was not his real
                                  known, as a result of which, the followers of
                                  the Abrahamic monotheism did not worship him.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Not only the polytheists, but also the
                                  monotheists were satisfied by the wise men’s
                                  discovery of a new God, as both of them had
                                  become dependent on their wisdom and
                                  knowledge. The conversion of the polytheists
                                  to monotheism united the Israelis under the
                                  auspices of a new religion, which came to be
                                  known as Judaism, a word clearly related to
                                  the worship of a zealous and vicious God, by
                                  the name of Jehovah. Today, the followers of
                                  Judaism are known as Jews.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Religious differences of the two religious
                                  groups thus fully eradicated from Israel, the
                                  wise men turned to ruling its Jewish
                                  population. But, as the concept of a
                                  government, headed by a President or a Prime
                                  Minister, could not even be remotely thought
                                  of at the time, the wise men became priests, a
                                  title that enabled them to exercise their
                                  authority over the populace from within the
                                  four walls of their temples.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  The smartest among the priests became the
                                  Chief Priest. He had the same power as does a
                                  President or a Prime Minister of our time. To
                                  make their rule effective and successful, the
                                  priests adopted and implemented all those
                                  rules and laws, which, they had told the
                                  Hebrews, God Jehovah had given Moses on Mount
                                  Sinai. Known as the Ten Commandments, these
                                  rules became the basis of their power and
                                  authority.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  Firmly enthroned on their seat of power in
                                  Jerusalem, and with the entire population of
                                  Israel effectively under their control, the
                                  priests maintained complete peace and
                                  tranquility in their land with an iron hand.
                                  This, however, did not bring about much change
                                  in the lifestyle of the impoverished Jews. But
                                  it did, indeed, afford the priests all the
                                  comforts that came to them automatically by
                                  virtue of power and authority they wielded on
                                  Israel, and on its people.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  As the time passed, there arose many Jewish
                                  prophets in Israel. Some of them became its
                                  kings. The governance of Jerusalem by the
                                  Jewish kings lasted until 586 B. C.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  During the time various Jewish kings’ were
                                  ruling Jerusalem, the priests continued to
                                  maintain their religious grip over the masses,
                                  thereby enjoying all the privileges they had
                                  reserved for themselves. Even when the foreign
                                  kings and governors became its rulers after
                                  586 B. C., the Jewish priests’ influence
                                  over the people remained undiminished.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  However, apart from keeping the ordinary folks
                                  enslaved to their religious authority, the
                                  priests were not known to have ever done
                                  anything else that could have changed the
                                  quality of the commoner’s life.
                                  Consequently, when the priests were having all
                                  their fingers dipped in milk and honey, the
                                  common folks passed their days in grinding
                                  poverty.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  What the Jewish priests had done a long, long
                                  time ago still continues to be present in our
                                  modern societies. Even now, in many of the
                                  world’s societies, priests are treated with
                                  more respect than it is given to scientists
                                  and sociologists; the priests’ words receive
                                  more attention than those of the scholars and
                                  philosophers.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  One of the impacts the priests’ role is
                                  having on some of our present-day societies is
                                  there for everyone to see: It has been
                                  creating enough dangerous forces that can
                                  hasten the causation of the so-called Dooms
                                  Day, without giving us any inkling of its
                                  arrival.<br>
