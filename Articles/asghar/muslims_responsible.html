                              <p><font face="Times New Roman">I lived for a time
                              in Calcutta, India. When I was going to school
                              there, I heard from my mentors that Muslims were
                              the victims of the Zionist, Hindu and Christian
                              conspiracies. I believed in their conspiracy
                              theories. I, therefore, saw no wrong when my
                              school hoisted the Pakistani flag every morning
                              and we sang the Pakistani national anthem before
                              the commencement of our classes.<br>
                              <br>
                              Unaware of its implications, I sang the Pakistani
                              national anthem with great enthusiasm in my school
                              in Calcutta. I gave my approval to everything
                              Pakistan did. I blindly supported Pakistan's fight
                              with India over Kashmir. I lauded Ayub Khan for
                              what he did in the name of Islam. Inspired by what
                              I heard from the Islamic preachers, I even tried
                              to memorize the whole Quran.<br>
                              <br>
                              I moved to the then East Pakistan in the later
                              part of 1950s. Here, too, I heard people talking
                              about the Muslims being killed by the Hindus; they
                              also narrated in details how the Jews and the
                              Christians had been conspiring to eliminate the
                              Muslims from the face of the earth. I was
                              convinced by what I heard in my formative years
                              and hoped that Pakistan would one day liberate
                              Muslims from their plight. I also had developed a
                              strong faith in the concept of Muslim Umma.<br>
                              <br>
                              I stepped into the real world in 1960. Working for
                              a bank, I realized how individuals, communities,
                              societies and nations functioned. My association
                              with various people convinced me that every human
                              being has an agenda. He does nothing without a
                              motive. The saint-like appearance as well as the
                              exhibition of good conduct is one of the
                              components of his agenda. Lying, cheating, forgery
                              and murder also have links to human motives and
                              greed.<br>
                              <br>
                              Then came the year 1965. Pakistan and India went
                              to war over Kashmir. India had the support of
                              Soviet Union, which helped it with most of its
                              essential sinews of war. United States and China
                              were on Pakistan's side. Under a treaty signed by
                              Pakistan and Turkey with the United States, the
                              latter was under an obligation to defend Pakistan,
                              but no concrete help came from the other side when
                              Pakistan was in need of it. China stood by its
                              friendship with Pakistan and tried to help it with
                              whatever help it could afford at that time.<br>
                              <br>
                              The Muslim Umma remained incoherent and
                              inconsistent in its utterances and support of
                              Pakistan. Even though Pakistan was fighting a war
                              purportedly to defend the rights of a section of
                              the Muslim Umma, no Muslim country provided
                              material help to Pakistan. Those Muslim countries,
                              which faced pressure from their citizenry to help
                              Pakistan, discharged their obligation by pleading
                              with God to make Pakistan the victor. While still
                              Pakistan was counting on God's help, Soviet Union
                              came forward in an effort to disengage the two
                              warring nations.<br>
                              <br>
                              The Soviet Union assembled Pakistan's Ayub Khan
                              and India's Lal Bahadur Shastri in Tashkent and
                              mediated a ceasefire. Non-Muslim countries praised
                              the Soviet Union for its efforts, while most of
                              the Muslim nations thanked God for saving the
                              Muslims from being defeated by the Indian kafirs.<br>
                              <br>
                              Following the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965, I
                              developed an interest in the observation of human
                              conducts. Over a period of time, I realized that
                              while many humans bind themselves in various
                              relationships purely for the sake of love and
                              affection, the great majority of them base their
                              social intercourse purely on their expediencies.
                              To them a relationship that does not yield
                              tangible benefits has no value and, as such, they
                              avoid it at all cost.<br>
                              <br>
                              In my ten years of service with two commercial
                              banks of Pakistan, I learned another lesson:
                              Powerful men always rule over the meek and the
                              week. I saw how my powerful bosses from West
                              Pakistan exploited our conditions; I witnessed how
                              they trampled the rules on seniority and promoted
                              juniors over their seniors; how they forced me to
                              approve loans for those who had abundant wealth at
                              their disposal, and also how they restrained me
                              from helping those who were struggling to stand on
                              their own feet.<br>
                              <br>
                              During 1970-71, I heard how leaders incited their
                              followers to rape women and commit murders. I saw
                              the bodies of their victims strewn over the
                              Railway tracts. In their frenzy, they raped their
                              female victims and then sliced away their breasts
                              from their chests. Many male corpses did not have
                              their genitals attached to their bodies. I also
                              saw the bodies of infants floating in ponds and
                              rivers.<br>
                              <br>
                              Later days' events opened up my eyes. I realized
                              that I was wrong in believing what I was told by
                              my peers as well as by the Islamic preachers. I
                              also realized that my support of Pakistan was not
                              only wrong, it was immoral too.<br>
                              <br>
                              Apocryphal scriptures also tell us how the
                              powerful invoked God for manipulating the hapless
                              among them. Citation of an example may be
                              appropriate here.<br>
                              <br>
                              According to a theological description, God had
                              created the earth for the purpose of having it
                              inhabited by mankind. For this purpose, he is
                              believed to have prepared a plan that covered all
                              aspects of human, faunal, floral and celestial
                              lives. His plan required women to conceive and
                              then to give birth to children.<br>
                              <br>
                              On giving a second thought to his plan, God
                              realized that it had a major flaw. If he proceeded
                              with his plan and created a woman first, it would
                              bestow on her the honor of being the first human
                              that he ever created. Even if he overlooked his
                              egoistic urges and went ahead with her creation,
                              this action of his was going to create another
                              problem of a gigantic proportion: It was the
                              thought of having to create the first man in a
                              woman's womb.<br>
                              <br>
                              In God's reckoning, it was a detestable plan. From
                              his perspective, it would have been a demeaning
                              act on his part to have a woman give birth to the
                              first man of our world. It would also have a
                              serious repercussion on men's' mental health: They
                              would always have felt not only inferior to their
                              female counterpart, their complex would also have
                              deprived them of the hegemonistic power that God
                              wanted them to exercise over the women's mind and
                              bodies.<br>
                              <br>
                              To solve the problem, God changed his plan and
                              adopted an unnatural process: First, he created
                              the man, and from his rib, he created the first
                              woman. This made women second to men - - - a
                              privilege that enables them to subjugate women and
                              also to use them in any manner or for any purpose
                              that satisfies not only their sexual ecstasies,
                              but also assuages their manly egos.<br>
                              <br>
                              The first hurdle thus overcome, God prepared to
                              plant the first human couple on earth. But here
                              again, he encountered another problem: How could
                              he let humans take up residence on earth without
                              obtaining from them the confession of his slavery.
                              He found his solution in the game of blaming. As
                              this game required proof before convicting a
                              person of a wrongdoing, the Muslim scripture
                              alleges that God felt no qualm in transforming a
                              gentle and docile jinni into a devil. It narrates
                              how angels opposed the creation of the first man
                              and how God punished them for their insolence. It
                              is also replete with various calumnies, which the
                              narrator of the primeval stories added to God's
                              character in order to make them lucid for his
                              listeners.<br>
                              <br>
                              In my opinion, the calumnies and insults that the
                              Quran heaves upon God have backfired; angered by
                              them, he simply abandoned the Muslims. His
                              displeasure is evident from their conditions; they
                              have been suffering from hunger, deprivations as
                              well as from all kinds of conceivable ignominies
                              and punishments, yet God does not feel it to be
                              necessary for him to come to their rescue, despite
                              being beseeched by them for zillions of times.<br>
                              <br>
                              The Quran speaks of a dubious methodology that God
                              allegedly used to control the mind of the first
                              man and his succeeding generations. Let us explore
                              his alleged modus operandi:<br>
                              <br>
                              God lived in a vacuum from the time of his
                              inception. After suffering from inactivity and
                              loneliness for a long time, he came up with the
                              idea of having the earth populated by humans,
                              faunas and floras. To make sure what he planned to
                              do was going to be good, he consulted the angels.
                              To them, the creation of animals, plants, trees
                              and mountains etc. appeared to be alright, but
                              they did not like the idea of having the earth
                              populated by humans who, they knew, were going to
                              &quot;make mischief and shed blood&quot; (2:30).<br>
                              <br>
                              The tone of the Quranic language makes it clear
                              that the God that Muhammad referred to bore all
                              the characters of a man. I recommend the
                              discerning readers to read &quot;God's
                              Phallus&quot; written by Rabbi Howard Eilberg-Schwartz.
                              He proved with forceful arguments that the God of
                              the Jews, Christians and the Muslims bears all
                              characteristics of a man.<br>
                              <br>
                              Also, a deep reading into Muhammad's statements
                              that appear in the Quran makes it clear that he
                              and God was one and the same person. Separating
                              him from God is an impossible task.<br>
                              <br>
                              The angels have no free will nor do they have the
                              ability to say anything without God's permission.
                              Therefore, the angels' forecast into futurity
                              amounted to defying God's authority and power. He
                              was upset. Calling them ignorant, God rejected
                              their opposition and created, out of clay, the
                              first human he called Adam.<br>
                              <br>
                              In fashioning Adam, God used his legs, hands,
                              eyes, ears and mouth (cf. 7:195). He used his
                              hands for molding the clay into a human figure.
                              When he saw it looked fine, he needed sun's rays
                              to make it dry. When he located a suitable spot,
                              he walked and placed the statue there for drying
                              up. When it dried up, he raised the statue to his
                              mouth's level and then passed his breath into its
                              lungs. In no time, Adam began acting like a normal
                              human being.<br>
                              <br>
                              The Quran does not tell us how his wife (it has
                              not given her a name) came into being. For her
                              story, I need to refer to the Torah, which tells
                              us that God had created her from one of Adam's
                              ribs. Mindful of the pain that the surgery was
                              going to cause, God caused a deep sleep to fall
                              upon Adam and when he was fast asleep, he
                              extracted one of his ribs. He made a woman out of
                              the rib and then presented her to Adam. Adam lost
                              no time in recognizing her; he also remembered it
                              was he who had contributed his bone for her making
                              (Gen. 2:21-23). Knowing that she was going to be
                              the mother of all living, Adam called her Eve
                              (Gen. 3:20).<br>
                              <br>
                              In the long history of mankind, Adam and Eve were
                              the only humans who did not have to suffer the
                              pains of birth, unstable stages of infancy and
                              childhood. They also did not have to struggle for
                              anything in their life, for God made sure that
                              they had everything to make their lives
                              comfortable and pleasant.<br>
                              <br>
                              After creating Adam and his mate, God drew a plan
                              for tackling the insolent angels. The plan
                              envisioned a learned Adam to prove that what they
                              had told God about the humans' conduct on earth
                              was based on falsehood. To implement his plan, God
                              needed to prepare Adam in all respects.<br>
                              <br>
                              He taught Adam the nature of all things. The
                              angels were not at all involved in the teaching
                              process. When Adam became fully prepared, God
                              placed all things before the angels and demanded
                              that they tell him the nature of those things, if
                              they were truthful (2:31). Realizing how angry God
                              was at them, the angels adopted a diplomatic
                              posture that they believed was gong to sooth his
                              injured ego. They told him: Glory to thee. Of
                              knowledge we have none, save what Thou hast taught
                              us: in truth it is Thou who art perfect in
                              knowledge and wisdom (2:32).<br>
                              <br>
                              Hearing the angels admit their ignorance, God
                              asked Adam to narrate the nature of the things.
                              Since God had prepared him for the occasion, Adam
                              had no difficulty in describing what God wanted
                              him to describe. Pleased by his disciple's
                              performance, God thundered to the angels: Did I
                              not tell you that I know the secrets of heavens
                              and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye
                              conceal? (2:33).<br>
                              <br>
                              The fact that the angels conceal things from God
                              infuriated him immensely. In a rage, he ordered
                              the angels to bow down before Adam, his prot√©g√©
                              (2:34). This order was to humiliate the angels.
                              Sensing risk to their existence, all angels bowed
                              down. A jinni who, it seems, was, at the time, in
                              the angels' company did not bow down before Adam.
                              Since God had ordered only the angels to bow down
                              before Adam, the jinn rightfully believed that the
                              order did not apply to him (read 18:50 to know who
                              Iblis was) and as such, he was not required to do
                              what the angels did before his eyes. God felt
                              insulted by the jinni's sense of righteousness,
                              honor and dignity.<br>
                              <br>
                              It was God's plan to have mankind bow down before
                              his authority. This ritual should have begun with
                              the first humans he created in heaven. But instead
                              of having them bow down before him, he made the
                              angels bow down before the humans. If he did not
                              want the humans to bow down before him until after
                              Muhammad had arrived, the only conclusion one can
                              draw from his action is this: he forced the angels
                              to bow down before Adam not only to humiliate
                              them, but also to press them into mankind's
                              service.<br>
                              <br>
                              The ways in which God is said to have been
                              conducting himself appears to defy common sense.
                              Strictly speaking from the viewpoint of a master,
                              it is inconceivable that he would ever let his
                              servant ride on his shoulders. God does not appear
                              to have understood the difficult relationship that
                              a servant is required to maintain with his master.
                              Had he understood the difference between a servant
                              and a master, he would not have posted two angels
                              on each of their master's shoulders to record
                              their acts and deeds. The issue of the servants
                              watching over their masters becomes more demeaning
                              for the latter; it emanates from the fact that
                              their guards have the habit of distorting facts
                              through lying and concealment.<br>
                              <br>
                              Realizing that the jinni was right, God controlled
                              himself and passed off the event by calling him
                              haughty. He dared not punish the jinni for a crime
                              he did not commit. God was also afraid of the
                              jinni's retaliatory nature hence his retrained
                              reaction toward his alleged disobedience of his
                              command.<br>
                              <br>
                              Regrettably, ordinary Muslims as well as their
                              scholars have failed to accept the fact that God
                              had not required the jinni to bow down before
                              Adam. Their failure stems from the fact that
                              accepting the truth will nullify the Quranic story
                              on Adam and Eve's expulsion from heaven. To defend
                              their position, Muslim scholars overlook the
                              contents of the relevant verses of the Quran and
                              insist that God's order equally applied to the
                              lone jinni who, as I have said earlier, was in the
                              company of the angels. God's alleged order was
                              specific; he used the specific Arabic word &quot;malaikati&quot;
                              in his order (2:34 et al), which means angels, and
                              not the jinni.<br>
                              <br>
                              Denying the truth, one reputed Muslim scholar took
                              issue with Iblis's accusation against God (7:16,
                              15:39). Trying to explain the Arabic word &quot;agwaitani&quot;
                              that appears in verse 15:39, he stated: ‚?¶
                              Satan as the Power of Evil cannot be straight or
                              truthful even before God. By his own arrogance and
                              rebellion he {Iblis} fell; he attributes this to
                              God. ‚?¶ (Abdullah Yusuf Ali, The Holy Quran,
                              Vol. 1, p. 644).<br>
                              <br>
                              The learned scholar is malicious, to say the
                              least, for there is no statement in the Quran that
                              supports his allegations against the so-called
                              devil.<br>
                              <br>
                              His score with the angels thus settled, God turned
                              to Adam and his wife. He told them to dwell in the
                              Garden (i.e. heaven) and to eat of the bountiful
                              things therein. He, however, prohibited them from
                              eating the fruit of a particular tree, lest they
                              get harmed and become transgressors (2:35, 7:22 et
                              al).<br>
                              <br>
                              At the time God directed their attention to the
                              forbidden tree, both Adam and his wife were blind.
                              Their inability to see afforded him the
                              opportunity to entangle them in his net of
                              treachery.<br>
                              <br>
                              Impersonating Iblis, God led the blind couple to
                              the forbidden tree and induced them to eat its
                              fruit. While they were eating the fruit, God
                              disappeared from their midst. Eating over, their
                              eyes opened up and Adam and his wife found
                              themselves naked. Seeing their discomfort, God
                              called unto them and asked: Did I not forbid you
                              that tree and tell you that Satan was an avowed
                              enemy unto you? (7:22). (The Quran does not say
                              that Adam and Eve had ever seen Iblis with their
                              own eyes, nor does it say that they had seen him
                              in their midst after their eyes opened up).<br>
                              <br>
                              Having already experienced God's deceptive and
                              fearsome nature, Adam was quick in admitting his
                              mistake. God, being inclined to pardon him, taught
                              him how to seek his forgiveness. Once Adam
                              approached him appropriately, God forgave his sin
                              (2:38).<br>
                              <br>
                              It appears from the Quran that Adam's wife also
                              had sought his forgiveness (7:23), but instead of
                              forgiving her, God expelled her from heaven
                              (7:24). Consequently, she lived her entire life
                              with the guilt of sin; her female descendants
                              still remain accursed in the sight of God.<br>
                              <br>
                              After destroying Adam and his wife's
                              self-confidence and moral, God ordered the trio
                              (Adam, his wife and Iblis) to get out of heaven.
                              Both the humans complied, but the jinni refused.
                              He knew that he had committed no sin nor was he
                              responsible for the act of Adam and his wife. He
                              also knew that it was God who had used his name
                              not only to malign him but also to expel him from
                              heaven.<br>
                              <br>
                              Being familiar with God's power and his ability to
                              manipulate, Iblis protested mildly to him for
                              having &quot;put him in the wrong&quot; (15:39).
                              God did not rebut his allegation, rather he
                              granted him the wish that was intended to
                              compensate him for the injuries he suffered at
                              God's hand (15:41, 42).<br>
                              <br>
                              I have delved into the story of Adam and Eve to
                              make a point and it is this: Not only men, even
                              God used his power (provided what the Quran says
                              is true) to subdue, control and rule over the
                              meeker and the weaker humans. This has been going
                              on from the time immemorial and it would continue
                              to affect the humanity for so long as it would
                              live on the planet earth.<br>
                              <br>
                              Now, let us look at the role that Muslims have
                              played in the affairs of the world; how they
                              treated their subjects and what the non-Muslims of
                              the present time think about them. In my endeavor
                              to keep the narrative short, I will skip the
                              non-essential elements of the Muslim behavior.<br>
                              <br>
                              Muhammad, through Islam, united his people under a
                              single banner. He also installed them at the helm
                              of the Muslim religious rites. Hajj stands at the
                              top of the list. In fact, by appointing his
                              kindred the Custodian of the Ka'aba, he bestowed
                              on them the perpetual leadership of the entire
                              Muslim community, a privilege that the Saudis are
                              still enjoying without ever facing forceful
                              opposition from other Muslims of the world.<br>
                              <br>

                              destructive impacts of hajj on the poor nations</font></b></p>
                              <p><font face="Times New Roman">Not knowing that
                              his motherland possessed a great wealth, Muhammad
                              made the pagan rituals of hajj the most important
                              part of Islam. This he did with a specific purpose
                              in his mind; as it provided sustenance to the
                              pagans in the past, its retention in Islam was
                              also intended to support the lives of the Muslims
                              of his native land. The Saudis depended on this
                              income until the middle of 1960s. Its importance
                              diminished a little after they began exporting the
                              crude oil. Even though the crude has been bringing
                              immense income to the Saudis, revenues from hajj
                              still remain an important component of Saudi
                              Arabia's yearly budget. Forecast of a declining
                              income from hajj causes headaches to the Saudi
                              financial planners. Having the commercial
                              viability of the Ka'aba in their mind, the Saudis
                              added attractive features to its precincts with
                              the aim to increase the number of its visitors.
                              The Saudis appear to have succeeded in their
                              mission; they now have more hajj pilgrims than
                              what they used to have some years ago. As planned
                              by Muhammad, Muslims would never stop their
                              support of the Saudis, for doing so would amount
                              to committing an unpardonable sin.<br>
                              <br>
                              It is a fact that Muhammad did everything to
                              ensure a better life for his fellow countrymen. It
                              is, therefore, in order for them to hold him in
                              high esteem as well as to live by the doctrines he
                              propounded for them. But why should we hold him at
                              par with God, when he has done nothing for us?<br>
                              <br>
                              Had he made provisions for the poor non-Saudi
                              Muslims to have a share in the revenues that the
                              hajj generates, I would have said that that was
                              the best he could have done in the time he lived.
                              But instead of providing succor to the
                              unaccountable number of the poor Muslims, he made
                              performance of hajj compulsory even for those
                              Muslims who live in the distant parts of the world
                              just to satisfy the needs of his brethren. While
                              passing the decree, he paid no attention to the
                              well being of a vast number of his unfortunate
                              followers.<br>
                              <br>
                              Animal sacrifice is the essential element of the
                              Muslim hajj. Muhammad required each pilgrim to
                              sacrifice at least one animal on Id day in the
                              valley of Mina (2:196). The inclusion of the rite
                              of sacrifice in the hajj proceedings proved to be
                              a boon for a people for whom animal husbandry was
                              the backbone of their economic life. So long as
                              the hajj rituals remained a domestic affair, the
                              Saudis had a hard time in selling their cattle
                              heads. Internationalization of the event solved
                              their problem; each year millions of pilgrims buy
                              from them and slaughter millions of animals. This
                              not only brings them wealth, it also encourages
                              them to raise more animals for meeting the demands
                              of their ever-increasing customers.<br>
                              <br>
                              On the flip side, hajj has been destroying the
                              economies of other nations of the world. To
                              substantiate my claim, I will highlight the case
                              of Bangladesh.<br>
                              <br>
                              It is one of the world's poorest countries. The
                              World Fact Book, updated on March 19, 2003, says
                              the following about Bangladesh:<br>
                              <br>
                              &quot;Despite sustained domestic and international
                              efforts to improve economic and demographic
                              prospects, Bangladesh remains a poor,
                              overpopulated, and ill-governed nation. Although
                              more than half of GDP is generated through the
                              service sector, nearly two-thirds of Bangladeshis
                              are employed in the agriculture sector, with rice
                              as the single most important product. Major
                              impediments to growth include frequent cyclones
                              and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises,
                              inadequate port facilities, a rapidly growing
                              labor force that cannot be absorbed by
                              agriculture, delays in exploiting energy resources
                              (natural gas), insufficient power supplies, and
                              slow implementation of economic reforms. Economic
                              reform is stalled in many instances by political
                              infighting and corruption at all levels of
                              government. Progress also has been blocked by
                              opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector
                              unions, and other vested interest groups. The BNP
                              government, led by Prime Minister Khaleda ZIA, has
                              the parliamentary strength to push through needed
                              reforms, but the party's level of political will
                              to do so has been lacking.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              The following additional information may help
                              readers in understanding my viewpoint:<br>
                              <br>
                              1. Bangladesh has a population of over 130 million
                              people.<br>
                              2. Over 45 million of its people are unemployed.<br>
                              3. Only about 275,000 people pay tax to the
                              government. Over 30% of the taxpayers are<br>
                              government employees.<br>
                              4. The per capita income of its people (GNP per
                              head of population) in 1998 was 350 US<br>
                              Dollars. In the last five years time, it might
                              have reached 450 US Dollars.<br>
                              5. About 75% of Bangladesh's annual budget depends
                              on foreign loans and aid.<br>
                              <br>
                              The above is a dismal picture of a desperate
                              nation. This is a nation that looks for foreign
                              loans and aid to meet its needs. As a result, this
                              nation owed a total loan of 17 Billion US Dollars
                              in the year 2000. This is a nation that cannot
                              afford to buy even a seismic equipment to monitor
                              the intensity of earthquakes that have been
                              hitting it for the last few years.<br>
                              <br>
                              Yet, over ten thousand of its people took pride in
                              performing their hajj last year. To determine the
                              harm that hajj and its related rituals cause to
                              the economic health of Bangladesh, let us note the
                              following facts:<br>
                              <br>
                              1. Each pilgrim spent over 3,000 American Dollars
                              on his hajj last year. This means that Bangladesh
                              lost over 30 Million American Dollars in 2002
                              alone on a purpose that did not help its economy,
                              nor it brought any good to its common people.<br>
                              <br>
                              2. In the same year, at least 500,000
                              Bangladeshis, who could not travel to Mecca,
                              sacrificed equal number of animals in their homes,
                              even though the Quran does not require them to do
                              so. Because Bangladeshi Muslims believe that
                              eating beef is better for their health, they
                              prefer sacrifice of cows to other animals. Those
                              who cannot afford cows discharge their religious
                              obligation by sacrificing goats and sheep. For the
                              past many years, Bangladesh has been experiencing
                              shortage of cows and oxen. There are many farmers
                              who cannot plough their land for the want for a
                              pair of cows or oxen. Instead of trying to meet
                              the farmers' needs, smugglers bring into
                              Bangladesh &quot;retired&quot; cows and oxen from
                              India in order to meet the Bangladeshi Muslims'
                              eating habit. On the eve of hajj, the smuggled
                              animals become handy for meeting their religious
                              fervor. On average, a Bangladeshi Muslim spends
                              about 100 US Dollars on a sacrificial animal.
                              Which means that the Bangladeshi Muslims squander
                              away 5 million US Dollars every year on a single
                              rite of their religion.<br>
                              <br>
                              3. Total amount that Bangladeshi Muslims spent on
                              their hajj and sacrificial animals last year must
                              have exceeded a staggering 35 Million US Dollars.
                              For a poor and debt-ridden country, what this
                              amount could do for its people is not a difficult
                              question for anyone to answer. Had the Bangladeshi
                              Muslims honestly invested all the money that they
                              have spent, during the last 30 years, on hajj and
                              sacrificial animals in projects like building
                              roads and bridges, Bangladesh would have, by this
                              time, joined the club of other &quot;developing
                              countries&quot; of the world. But, alas! National
                              pride does not have any value for the Muslims; for
                              them fulfillment of their religious obligations,
                              at any cost, takes precedence over all other
                              things of their individual and national lives.</font></p>

                              <p>Muhammad had introduced the concept of Umma for
                              a special reason: It was a tool that he used to
                              compel the Medinese Muslims to come to the help of
                              the Meccan refugees. He never intended it to
                              become an international phenomenon.<br>
                              <br>
                              The ghost of Muslim Umma came to fore when Muslim
                              rulers realized that they were going to lose their
                              power and dominance over their occupied lands.
                              Knowing that the Islam-related issues easily
                              incite the Muslims, their leaders often used the
                              perceived fidelity of Muslim brotherhood either to
                              propel them to power or to prevent their fall from
                              power. Apart from the Muslim leaders, Islamic
                              scholars and preachers also have used, at the cost
                              of national interests, the ghost of Muslim
                              brotherhood to promote the interests of Islam. To
                              make themselves effective in their propaganda,
                              Muslim scholars and preachers relied on a
                              statement of the Quran, which tells the faithful
                              that the entire earth belongs to them and that
                              they should strive hard to take over its full
                              ownership from its infidel inhabitants.<br>
                              <br>
                              Muhammad Ali Jinnah had India divided on the basis
                              of Muslim majority. Creation of Pakistan was
                              intended to be the first step towards Islamizing
                              the entire Indian sub-continent. Muslims' revolt
                              in the Philippines is a link of the chain that
                              Muslims intend to use for enslaving the infidels
                              of the land. Jemmah Islamiya of Indonesia has a
                              grandiose plan of its own; it has a vision to turn
                              northern Australia into a pan-Islamic state
                              (Canberra Times, October 29, 2002).<br>

                              In the matter of patriotic infidelity, the Indian
                              Muslims do not seem to have competitors. Living in
                              India, most of them sing the song of Pakistan. In
                              matters in which India and Pakistan jockey for the
                              first place, most of the Indian Muslims pray to
                              God for making Pakistan the winner. I have seen
                              many Indian Muslims beating their chests when
                              India defeated Pakistan in the sport of Cricket; I
                              have seen the same people distributing sweetmeats
                              when Pakistan won over India.<br>
                              <br>
                              Apart from dividing the entire humanity into
                              Muslims and infidels, the doctrine of Muslim
                              Brotherhood (Umma) has done nothing to salvage the
                              Muslims from their sufferings. The Saudi Arabian
                              government's attitude towards the displaced Muslim
                              Palestinians is a pertinent example. Despite the
                              fact that many Palestinians took birth on the
                              Saudi Arabian soil, its government refused to help
                              them by granting them citizenship. Despite the
                              fact that many Islamic governments have been
                              begging the entire world to make investments in
                              their countries, not too many rich Muslim
                              countries have come forward to help them out.
                              Despite the fact that many Muslims have been
                              living in grinding poverty, their &quot;brothers
                              in Islam&quot; hardly feel it to be their
                              obligation to come to their rescue. Instead, rich
                              Muslims prefer to invest their surplus funds in
                              the Christian dominated West where they find more
                              avenues not only to make more money but also to
                              lead a life, filled with all sorts of thrills.<br>
                              <br>
                              In view of what the Muslims had been planning for
                              the entire world, it is no wonder that non-Muslims
                              nations took to looking at them suspiciously.
                              Other acts that some of the Muslims undertook
                              recently to demonstrate their hatred of the
                              non-Muslim nations boomeranged against themselves,
                              for most of the non-Muslim nations of the world
                              now feel insecured in the presence of the Muslims.
                              I will have more to say about this situation
                              later.</p>

                              tried to get rid of this scourge, but I do not

                              their efforts. Singapore, under Lee Kwan Yu,

                              it cannot claim that it does not have corrupt
                              people among its populace.<br>

                              In fact, corruption is a worldwide phenomenon. It
                              is like termite that eats into the vital aspects
                              of the effected nation's economic life. Almost all
                              people of the world recognize the baneful effect
                              of corruption, but in the face of its rampant
                              prevalence, all efforts have so far failed in
                              putting this jinni into the bottle.<br>

                              Corruption appears to have a special place among
                              the Muslims. According to a report of Transparency
                              International, published in 2003, Bangladesh
                              topped the list of the corrupt nations of the
                              world. Of course, the Bangladesh government
                              dismissed the report, citing partiality on the
                              part of Transparency International.<br>

                              I lived in Bangladesh for over forty years. During
                              my service life, which spanned from 1960 to 1971,
                              I saw a lot of people participating in various
                              corruptions. I began my business career in the
                              first quarter of 1972. I moved to the United
                              States in 1998.<br>
                              <br>
                              In the period beginning from 1971 and ending in
                              1998, I noticed a marked increase in the level of
                              corruption in Bangladesh. My stepmother died in
                              1995; I had to bribe the custodian of the
                              graveyard for a place to bury her. I could not pay
                              my real estate tax without bribing the Tax
                              Collector. I could not get my Driver's License
                              without making the clerk happy. I could not get
                              the &quot;Fitness Certificate&quot; for my brand
                              new car without greasing the palms of the
                              Inspector.<br>
                              <br>
                              I saw how judges took bribes before acquitting the
                              accused persons. I read in the newspapers how
                              professors changed the answer scripts of the
                              students to declare them successful in their
                              exams. I witnessed how police changed their charge
                              sheets to help murderers escape punishment. I
                              regularly gave donations to student leaders for
                              not disturbing me at home and at my office. The
                              amount of &quot;gratuities and bribes&quot; I paid
                              in twenty-six years will appear mind boggling to
                              many, who are not fully acquainted with the level
                              of corruption in Bangladesh.<br>
                              <br>
                              Islam approves bribery. In connection with the
                              words &quot;(funds) for those whose hearts have
                              been (recently) reconciled&quot; that appear in
                              verse 9:60, Maulana Abul Ala Modudi wrote:<br>
                              <br>
                              &quot;Reconciliation of hearts means to charm or
                              captivate. The order means that those opponents
                              who remain active against Islam, or those people
                              who are in the camps of the infidels or those
                              people who have embraced Islam but are likely to
                              return to their previous religion due to their
                              financial constrains, those people should be given
                              money to earn their support for Islam, or to
                              neutralize their harmful activities against Islam
                              or to prevent them from returning to their
                              previous religion. For these purposes, money
                              procured through booty or other sources can be
                              used. If need be, zakat money can also be used. It
                              is not necessary that the recipients have to be
                              beggars, poor or travelers to receive the zakat
                              money. Even those who are wealthy and rich also
                              qualify to receive payment from the Zakat
                              Fund&quot; (Tafhimul Quran, Vol. 2, p. 206; above
                              is a loose rendering of the comments made in
                              Urdu).<br>
                              <br>
                              Since Muhammad himself used bribery to achieve his
                              objectives, it is not surprising that his
                              followers have been keeping his tradition alive by
                              giving and receiving bribes. I have not come
                              across too many Muslims who frowned upon bribery.
                              Nor have I heard or read any Muslim cleric who
                              opposed the practice or issued fatwa (religious
                              edict) against it. To me, verse 9:60 appears to be
                              the culprit; it prevents even the conscientious
                              Muslims from chastising the practitioners of this
                              heinous crime.<br>
                              <br>
                              I noticed a unique pattern that various corrupt
                              people of Bangladesh use to expiate their sins, or
                              should I say their crimes. Corrupt people make it
                              a point to say their Juma Prayer in grand mosques.
                              Before closing their weekly prayer, all
                              participants seek God's forgiveness for the sins
                              they committed during their life. Many can be seen
                              crying and shedding tears from their eyes. By the
                              time they return to their powerful seats the next
                              day, they forget what they had promised God the
                              previous day. They feel no guilt in violating the
                              promise they made to him earlier in the belief
                              that they would have another opportunity to seek
                              his forgiveness for the sins they committed in the
                              days preceding the upcoming Friday.<br>
                              <br>
                              Other Bangladeshi Muslims use more ostentatious
                              means to get rid of their sins. Knowing that hajj
                              cleanses all sins of the sinners, they rush to
                              Saudi Arabia every time they get the chance to
                              perform the rites of hajj. I have seen many
                              hajjis, some among them being my close friends,
                              reverting more aggressively to their previous
                              activities in order to compensate for what they
                              missed during their sojourn in Mecca. To many
                              Muslims, commission of sins and washing them off
                              occasionally is a way of life. What God thinks
                              about it is a matter that should not be difficult
                              for a reader to fathom.</p>

                              uniting the former pagans under the banner of
                              Islam, Muhammad also had changed their ways of
                              life. The wealth seized from the Jews and
                              distributed among his hungry followers was an
                              impetus for them to crave for more of it. They
                              were willing to go to any length to sustain the
                              lifestyle they were introduced to by Muhammad

                              The conquest by the Muslims of Syria, Iraq, Persia
                              and Egypt etc. brought about additional changes to
                              their thinking process. It dawned on them that the
                              people of their newly acquired territories had
                              great wealth, which enabled them to live easy and
                              comfortable lives. Promptly, the conquerors took
                              over their possessions and then embarked upon a
                              journey of conquests that was intended to afford
                              them all the comfort and luxuries of life.<br>

                              All the victims of Muslim aggressions were not
                              prepared to face a marauding force that had
                              originated from the harsh and rugged soil of
                              Arabia. Consequently, all of its victims crumbled
                              in the face of its onslaughts. Having
                              categorically barred the Muslims from establishing
                              peaceful and affable contacts with the unbelievers
                              (see Ali Dashti, Twenty-three Years, p. 82,83),
                              Muhammad further urged them &quot;not to be weak
                              and call for peace when they were uppermost
                              (47:35). Inspired by the above statements as well
                              as by the commandment of verse 47:4, the invaders
                              showed no mercy towards their victims at the time
                              of exacting ransoms from them. Those who could not
                              pay ransoms, converted to Islam to avoid death or
                              the harshness of the Islamic rule, thus helping
                              the victorious Arabs to lay the foundation of
                              their empire. Founded in 638 A. D., the Muslim
                              empire over a vast area of the world lasted until
                              1683 A. D.<br>

                              The Arabs' hold on their possessions emboldened
                              them to impose various restrictions on their
                              non-Muslim subjects. Where the humane side of the
                              Muslim rulers became a hurdle, the Quran overrode
                              their concerns, for it stipulated:<br>
                              <br>
                              Fight those who believe not<br>

                              Nor hold that forbidden<br>
                              Which hath been forbidden<br>
                              By God and His Apostle,<br>
                              Nor acknowledge the Religion<br>
                              Of Truth, (even if they are)<br>
                              Of the People of the Book,<br>
                              Until they pay the Jizya<br>
                              With willing submission,<br>
                              And feel themselves subdued (9:29).<br>
                              <br>
                              In making the harsh Muslim rule harsher, the above
                              Quranic statement became handy. Deriving guidance
                              from it, Muslims divided their non-Muslim subjects
                              into three categories. And those were:<br>
                              <br>
                              1.Dhimmis were non-Muslims subjects who lived in
                              Muslim countries and agreed to pay the Jizya
                              (tribute) in exchange for protection and safety,
                              and to be subject to Islamic law.<br>
                              <br>
                              2. People of the Hudna (truce) were those who
                              signed a peace of treaty with Muslims after being
                              defeated in war. They agreed to reside in their
                              own land, yet to be subject to the legal
                              jurisprudence of Islam like the Dhimmis, provided
                              they did not wage war against the Muslims.<br>
                              <br>
                              3. Musta'min (protected one) were the persons who
                              came to an Islamic country as messengers,
                              merchants, visitors, or students wanting to learn
                              about Islam. A Musta'min was not supposed to take
                              part in war against the Muslims and was not
                              required to pay the Jizya, but was urged to
                              embrace Islam. If he did not become a Muslim, he
                              was required to return to his homeland.<br>
                              <br>
                              For the benefit of the readers, I will briefly
                              discuss the concept and implications of the Jizya
                              Tax.<br>
                              <br>
                              Jizya literally means penalty. Its payment
                              protected the non-Muslims who lived under Islamic
                              regimes. It also confirmed their legal status.
                              Those who could not pay this tax were required to
                              convert to Islam. Refusal to convert meant certain
                              death.<br>
                              <br>
                              Apart from penalizing the Dhimmis for living in a
                              Muslim state, Muslims used the Jizya tax system
                              not only to humiliate them, but also to force them
                              to submit themselves to their superior authority.
                              The Dhimmis tolerated the Muslims and lived under
                              their atrocious rule due to their own weaknesses
                              and shortcomings.<br>
                              <br>
                              Believing that the Dhimmis were destined to suffer
                              at the hands of their foreign masters, the later
                              day Muslim rulers took other steps to humiliate
                              them more effectively. In 853, Caliph al-Mutawakkil
                              forbade Dhimmis from riding horses; they were to
                              stick to donkeys and mules. Jews living in the
                              14th century Egypt had to wear a yellow turban and
                              the Christians a blue one to publicly demonstrate
                              their religious preferences (see The Encyclopedia
                              of the Orient for additional information).<br>
                              <br>
                              I believe that the Christian were forced to launch
                              their crusades to free their brethren from the
                              Muslim excesses. Their efforts galvanized the
                              Christians' resistance against the Muslims, who,
                              eventually, lost all they had captured through
                              brute force. After losing their dominance over
                              their non-Muslim subjects, Muslims began to
                              disappear from the world scene. Taking their fate
                              into their own hands, the Christians took all
                              those steps that were necessary for them to build
                              a powerful position of their own.<br>
                              <br>
                              In bettering the Christians' fortunes, science
                              played an important role. It brought them wealth,
                              power and prestige. Using their newly acquired
                              muscle, the Christians became a dominant force of
                              the world. While the influence of the Christian
                              British was waning, the powerful Christian America
                              stepped up to fill the vacuum that the British
                              retreat was creating across the globe.<br>
                              <br>
                              Apart from fighting and defeating the Nazi
                              Germany, the Fascist Italy and the Imperialistic
                              Japan, America, along with its war allies, helped
                              create a Jewish State in the Middle East. Unable
                              to resist the ever-increasing Christian and Jewish
                              power, a large number of Palestinians left their
                              ancestral homes and took shelter in refugee camps
                              that had sprung up in various parts of the Middle
                              East.<br>
                              <br>
                              To the Christian world, the establishment of the
                              Jewish State redeemed the excesses that the Jews
                              had suffered at the hands of the Christians and
                              the Muslims; to the Muslims it was the usurpation
                              of their land by a religious group of people whom
                              they hated from the bottom of their hearts.
                              Consequently, the Muslim world not only refused to
                              recognize the State of Israel; it also declared a
                              perpetual war against the Jewish State.<br>
                              <br>
                              Knowing the precarious conditions of the Israelis,
                              the United States supported Israel with money and
                              the sinews of war. Knowing well that economic well
                              being brings success, the Jews of their own
                              concentrated on improving their economic
                              conditions. Muslims, on the other hand, proceeded
                              with their war preparations with the belief that
                              their faith was enough to make them successful
                              against the Jews. To them, belief in God and in
                              his partisan support for Muslims were good reasons
                              to plunge their nations into war with a nation
                              that they believed consisted of people whom God
                              cursed (4:46), despised (2:65) and who were
                              destined to face disgrace on earth and the world
                              hereafter (5:41).<br>
                              <br>
                              Thus influenced by their beliefs but otherwise
                              unprepared for the task, a coalition of Muslim
                              nations attacked the tiny Israel twice. Both the
                              time, the Jews won, proving that what decides a
                              nation's fate and success is not the blind faith
                              of its people; they have to have nationalism,
                              unity, economic strength and preparedness along
                              with technological edge to come out successful in
                              their endeavors.<br>
                              <br>
                              Unable to believe that Israel could defeat and
                              annex a chunk of the attackers' territory, Muslims
                              the world over blamed America for the ignominious
                              defeat of their Middle Eastern brothers. The
                              notion that America was behind the coalition's
                              defeat coupled with the fact they lost their
                              empire and power, made Muslims bitter not at
                              themselves but at the Americans. Calling America
                              the &quot;Great Satan,&quot; Muslims began
                              preparing themselves to settle their score with
                              the American people. To achieve their objective,
                              they instilled hatred of the America infidels into
                              their children's mind; they also told them that
                              killing infidels was an act that God approved and
                              that he would open up the gates of heaven for
                              those Muslims who became martyrs while trying to
                              kill his infidel enemies.<br>
                              <br>
                              One crop of the brainwashed Muslims attacked the
                              World Trade Center in New York in 1993. It was
                              inspired by an ungrateful Muslim cleric whose life
                              America saved from being taken away by the
                              government of his native country. Having failed to
                              achieve the desired result, another crop attacked
                              the same target along with some others in
                              Washington, D. C., and Pennsylvania. This time,
                              God's soldiers used American plans to destroy
                              innocent humans lives and American properties. In
                              my opinion, the attacks of 2001 on American soil
                              was unprecedented in human history; humans fought
                              many dangerous battles and wars but what the 19
                              Muslims did on that fateful day of September would
                              continue to haunt mankind for an indefinite period
                              of time.<br>
                              <br>
                              America had to react in its self-defense. It
                              attacked the nerve center of the Muslim
                              terrorists. In the process of eliminating the
                              Muslim terrorists, American attacks also killed
                              some innocent people. Muslims did not like what
                              America did to defend its citizens and their
                              interests, for they believed America would
                              continue to live with their terrorism without
                              reacting with an iron fist.<br>
                              <br>
                              What followed the attack on Afghanistan is known
                              to all of us. Also, I do not think it is necessary
                              for me to mention here what has happened so far in
                              Iraq. It, however, needs to be stated here that in
                              the conflict that the Muslims have initiated,
                              Muslims stand to lose whatever they have achieved
                              thus far.<br>
                              <br>
                              After the events of September 11, the world has
                              changed. Most non-Muslims do not trust the Muslims
                              in the way they used to trust them before. For the
                              Muslims, the world has become a &quot;constricting
                              boa.&quot; They are being denied entry to many
                              non-Muslim countries. Immediately after the
                              aftermath of September 11, many non-Muslim
                              businessmen were afraid to visit the Muslim
                              countries. How far they have been able to overcome
                              their fear by this time remains a question for the
                              observers to answer.<br>
                              <br>
                              Many poor Muslims who dreamed of making their
                              living in the non-Muslim countries would face
                              tremendous difficulties in fulfilling their dream.
                              Consequently, poor Muslim countries like
                              Bangladesh and Pakistan would see a drastic fall
                              in their Foreign Exchange Reserves. This would
                              curtail their ability not only to meet their
                              import and developmental needs; it would also
                              diminish their ability in meeting their loan and
                              interest payment obligations.<br>
                              <br>
                              Lack of their acceptability in non-Muslim
                              countries would deny employment to many Muslims.
                              Tightening of immigration laws by the United
                              States has already forced many Muslims to go back
                              to the countries of their origin. This trend is
                              likely to continue in the foreseeable future.<br>
                              <br>
                              Muslim countries are also likely to face internal
                              discontentment due to some of the circumstances I
                              have mentioned above. Internal difficulties in
                              countries like Bangladesh and Indonesia are likely
                              to effect the social environments of their
                              neighbors. This might create tension in the
                              respective regions of the effected countries. How
                              much sympathy or support Muslim countries might
                              receive from the Christian World to resolve their
                              problems is difficult for anyone to forecast at
                              this time.<br>
                              <br>
                              Are not Muslims responsible for what is happening
                              to them now? Or should they not take responsiblity
                              for what is likely to happen to them in future?<br>
