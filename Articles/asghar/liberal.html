                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center">
								&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">The above question was 
								asked by the Economist of England. Mr. Irfan 
								Husain, one of the respected columnists of one 
								of Pakistan’s premier English Dailies, 
								reproduced it at the end of his recently written 
								weekly column “Liberalism and tolerance” with a 
								desire to find out if anybody has a definitive 
								answer to the Economist’s most vexing question.&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Irfan incorporated the 
								Economist’s question in his article with a 
								specific purpose and it is the backlash against 
								Muslims and Islam in the West and in some other 
								non-Muslim countries of the world. Like world’s 
								other concerned citizens who want to see the 
								backlash against Muslims and their faith 
								stopped, but do not know how, Irfan made a 
								commendable effort at finding out the causes 
								that make Muslims the object of backlash in the 
								western and some other societies. After noting 
								that Muslims have, of late, gone through a 
								behavioral change, he observed that xenophobia 
								and blind anti-western sentiments have not only 
								blinded most of the Muslims, their outrage at 
								how some westerners and other non-Muslims view 
								and treat them have also been preventing them 
								from realizing where their own prejudices have 
								already taken or are likely to take them to in 
								the days to come. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Concurring with Irfan’s 
								observation, I will attempt to point out some of 
								the prime causes that are responsible for the 
								treatment Muslims have started receiving from 
								most of the non-Muslim people of the world. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Contrary to the general 
								perception, Muslims are a group of people who 
								are generally normal and peace-loving. Like the 
								believers of other faiths, they get married; 
								raise families and lead normal lives. They live 
								in communities and interact with their fellow 
								members in the same manner in which all normal 
								and civil people are expected to behave, but the 
								sign of ‘normalcy’ in most of the Muslims 
								disappears when they are faced with issues that 
								pertain to their religion as well as when the 
								application of its doctrines in their lives 
								surfaces. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Tolerance in the Muslims 
								takes a back seat when the question of following 
								Islam by their family members arises. When 
								cajolement fails, they very often force them to 
								make Islam an important part of their lives. 
								They are known for making their kids of four to 
								five years old to read and learn the Quran when 
								they are supposed to be playing with their toys. 
								They turn their female kids of same age group 
								into women by making them to follow all those 
								Islamic rules, which are supposed to be followed 
								only by the grown up Muslim women. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Reluctance on the part of 
								their children to follow what they are asked to 
								follow turns their parents and peers into 
								dictators. In their dictatorial capacity, they 
								force their children into their obedience. Very 
								often, they torture their children into knowing 
								and following Islam. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Muslims have never been 
								kind to the critics of their faith and its 
								myriad doctrines. They fly into a rage when 
								someone says, for example, that the Prophet of 
								their faith was fond of women. They turn violent 
								when they are told that what their Prophet had 
								done with infant Aisha was equal to a pedophilic 
								act.&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Unlike the followers of 
								Judaism and Christianity- two other major 
								religions of the world- Muslims believe that 
								every word of the Quran came from none but from 
								their Allah. This belief makes the Quran 
								extraordinarily sacred to them. Following the 
								teaching of their religion, Muslims dedicate 
								themselves to upholding the sacredness of the 
								Quran even it is likely to cost them their own 
								lives.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">While adopting belligerent 
								postures towards those who believe that each and 
								every word of the Quran is not from Allah, 
								Muslims do not feel any qualm in discarding the 
								Quran in order to uphold their belief. This is 
								deducible from their rigid unwillingness to take 
								lesson from the content of the following verse:&nbsp;</font></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
									<font face="Verdana"><i>“Lo! We inspire thee 
									as We inspired Noah and the prophets after 
									him, as We inspired Abraham and Ishmael and 
									Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus 
									and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and 
									as We imparted unto David the Psalms</i>” 
									(4:163, as translated by Mohammed Mermaduke 
									Pickthall).&nbsp; </font></p>
								</blockquote>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">The following verse 
								explains the above content:&nbsp;</font></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
									<font face="Verdana"><i>“Say (O Muhammad, to 
									mankind): Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he 
									it is who hath revealed (this Scripture) to 
									thy heart by Allah’s leave, confirming that 
									which was (revealed) before it, and a 
									guidance and glad tidings to believers</i>;” 
									(2:97-as translated by Pickthall). </font>
									</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">The speaker of the above 
								verses is Allah. He makes it clear that He sent 
								His inspirations to Muhammad, through angel 
								Gabriel, to his heart (the ancient Arabs 
								believed that their ‘hearts,’ and not their 
								minds, were the depository of their 
								intelligence, hence Allah’s decision to use this 
								word in His message to Muhammad). &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Giving inspirations through 
								heart does not mean that the angel Gabriel 
								actually spoke to the Prophet of Islam. He 
								simply inspired him on Allah’s behalf. After 
								receiving inspirations in his heart, Muhammad 
								relayed them to his followers in his own words. 
								&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">The following example will 
								make the point clearer. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Very often, Architects 
								receive inspirations from nature and their 
								surroundings. They then put down those 
								inspirations on paper. They use signs, drawings 
								and words to express their inspirations, even 
								though no words were involved when&nbsp; they 
								received them from nature and their 
								surroundings. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Muslims do not want to 
								understand this simple fact. Instead, they 
								insist that each and every word of the Quran is 
								from Allah. This is a very contentious issue, 
								which they cannot substantiate either logically 
								or with palpable proof. Failure to do so not 
								only makes them highly agitated, their 
								aggressive approach to the contestants of their 
								belief also turns them into an undesirable 
								elements. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Before the occurrence of 
								the events of September 11, the people of the 
								West did not pay much attention to the Muslims’ 
								bigotry and their extreme obsession with their 
								religious beliefs. They have now come to realize 
								that Muslims are a different species. They have 
								also come to understand that Muslims would not 
								mind to sacrifice their own lives should such an 
								extreme action be necessary for them to defend 
								their beliefs. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">The realization of 
								realities has been forcing the Westerners and 
								the other people of the industrialized nations 
								to take actions to safeguard their own lives and 
								properties from the destructive actions of the 
								Muslims. For securing themselves, they have to 
								be weary of the Muslims’ presence in their 
								midst. &nbsp;They have to make sure that they are not 
								going to be attacked again by those Muslims who 
								have been living in their neighborhoods. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">After what has happened so 
								far in Australia, Spain and Indonesia etc., no 
								sensible person should believe that the hugely 
								panic-stricken people of the West and the other 
								people of the industrialized nations are going 
								to be as liberal and tolerant as they had been 
								towards the Muslims in the past. This attitude 
								of theirs has already begun to take its root. 
								Only an observant person can feel its presence 
								in almost all the societies of the West. And the 
								Muslims have already begun paying a high price 
								for their religious bigotry and intolerance even 
								though a large number of them do not deserve the 
								treatment they are being subjected to by many 
								suspecting people of the West.&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">After all, it is not 
								possible for each and every person of the West 
								to find out who is a bad Muslim and who is not. 
								Therefore, even the best among them have started 
								feeling the heat of their hosts’ stare and 
								unwelcoming attitude. &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Can anyone in his right 
								mind blame the people of the West for their 
								changed attitude towards the Muslims?&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
