  <p align="justify">Abd al Muttalib was the guardian of the temple of Ka'aba
  and from it he had a good income. But because his family consisted of a large
  number of people, he often found it difficult to meet all of their needs. As a
  result, tension prevailed, most of the time, among his family members, even
  though they always put up a smiling face while being outside their home.<br>
  <br>
  Muhammad's inclusion in the family did not help the situation; rather, it
  brought about an additional load. All members of the family wanted him gone
  but as he was under his grandfather's protection, none dared ask him to leave.
  It did not mean that they had to develop a love for the child; what actually
  happened was exactly its opposite: They began to hate him and missed no
  opportunity that came to them to harass him. They might not have inflicted
  bodily injuries on him, but they almost certainly harmed him, beyond repairs,
  emotionally and psychologically.<br>
  <br>
  When he suffered at the hands of his grandfather's family members, none of its
  female members ever came forward either to rescue him from their harassment or
  to console him afterwards. This attitude of theirs brought to his mind his
  mother's memory. He longed to be with her; wanted to be loved and hugged by
  her, but he could have none of them for the reason that she had abandoned him
  in the midst of those strange people. He started developing a hatred of his
  own towards his mother!<br>
  <br>
  About three years after Muhammad had joined his family, Abd al Motallib found
  his end approaching. He, therefore, handed him over to his eldest son, Abu
  Taleb, in whose household he lived for several years.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">THE CITY OF MECCA<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The little town of Mecca, situated near the Red Sea coast
  of Arabia, had acquired great importance by the sixth century for two
  different reasons: It became an important center of idol worshipping, to which
  many of the nomadic tribes of Arabia made pilgrimages on a regular basis. In
  addition to its religious prestige, however, Mecca also became an active
  center for commerce, from where caravans departed to various destinations on
  their trading missions.<br>
  <br>
  Mecca was then a tiny township and most of its inhabitants belonged to the
  Quraish tribe whose number could not have exceeded a couple of thousands. It
  was, and it still remains, an arid and inhospitable land incapable of
  producing anything to support its inhabitants' lives. Its pathways were dusty,
  with no civic facility worth its name existing therein. Its inhabitants knew
  nothing about personal health or hygiene.<br>
  <br>
  Dwelling in tiny roofless homes built of clay, they survived in extreme
  poverty, which forced many of them to use goat and sheep skin to cover their
  bodies. No school of any kind existed in Mecca. In contrast to the Meccans,
  the Jews of Madina are believed to have run their own schools in which they
  instructed their children, primarily in the matters of their religious
  disciplines.<br>
  <br>
  Because the Arabs could hardly ignite fire, both for cooking and illumination,
  they ate dates, locusts and lizards, and depended on camel's milk as a
  substitute for water. However, the Quran says that Allah had provided them
  with some kind of &quot;green trees&quot; (36:80) from which they obtained
  fire to meet their needs. During nights, the Arabs stayed inside their tents
  and homes, fearing mischief from capricious Jinns, which they believed,
  attacked mankind in darkness at solitary places.<br>
  <br>
  Having nothing worthwhile to do either during the day or night, most of the
  people spent their time gossiping, drinking, gambling or narrating the fables
  that came down to them through generation after generation. Their other main
  pastime was an inordinate obsession with sex, both hetero-and homosexual, for
  they were reputed to have been endowed with great sexual virility. Muhammad
  possessed so much of virility, it is said, that he was able to satisfy all of
  his wives, numbering nine, during a single night.<br>
  <br>
  The Arabs also practiced pederasty, an act they considered to be a normal part
  of their sexual conduct. Their womenfolk also led a highly licentious life,
  engaging themselves in sexual acts with any men they felt attracted to. Men
  recognized this conduct as being normal on the part of their women.<br>
  <br>
  On the death of Abd al Mottalib, his son, Abu Talib succeeded to the
  guardianship of Ka'aba, assuming the religious functions performed by all of
  his predecessors. The priestly office held by him required his sacerdotal
  household to observe rigidly all the rites and ceremonies of the sacred House
  of Allah. This afforded young Muhammad the opportunity to observe them closely
  and to record them in his mind, enabling him later to incorporate most of
  them, sans the idol worshipping, in his own religion.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">PAGAN RITES<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The rites and ceremonies practiced by the pagan Arabs
  before the advent of Islam consisted of, among others, the following:<br>
  <br>
  -The pagans observed three principal fasts within the year; one of seven, one
  of nine, and one of thirty days. During their fasts, they ate and drank, but
  refrained from conversations.<br>
  -They prayed three times each day; about sunrise, at noon, and about sunset,
  turning their faces in the direction of Ka'aba (Washington Irving, Mahomet and
  his successors, p. 31).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -They performed a yearly pilgrimage or hajj, which
  required them to circumambulate the Ka'aba seven times, to run between the two
  hills called Safa and Marwa on each of which was installed a male and a female
  idol, to sacrifice animals in the name of the deities, and then to shave the
  heads of all male pilgrims. Female pilgrims satisfied the later commandment
  simply by having a few locks of their haircut off.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">ALLAH<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">One of the three hundred and sixty idols the pagans
  worshipped was called Allah, having all the essential characteristics of a
  man. He was one of their principal deities. They believed that this Allah gave
  them life and sustained them with his mercy and kindness. This deity was known
  as Al-Rahman-an (the merciful) and Al-Rahim (the compassionate) to the people
  of Northern and Southern Arabia.<br>
  <br>
  The inscription (542-3) of Abrahah dealing with the break of the Ma'rib Dam
  bears testimony to this historical fact. The inscription begins with the
  following words: &quot;In the power and grace and mercy of the Merciful ((Rahman-an)
  and His messiah and of the Holy Spirit.&quot; The name Al-Rahman-an is
  especially significant because al-Rahman became later a prominent attribute of
  Allah, and one of His ninety-nine names in the Quran. Sura or chapter nineteen
  of the Quran is dominated by the word al-Rahman. Though used in the
  inscription for the Christian God, yet the word is evidently borrowed from the
  name of one of the older South Arabian deities.<br>
  <br>
  In truth, Muhammad, at the beginning of his career as a prophet, had required
  his followers to worship this same statuary Allah. He changed this commandment
  later to suite his concept of a God who, he believed, had no form or shape,
  thus separating his concept from that of the pagans and other polytheists of
  his time.<br>
  <br>
  Apart from the stated rites, the pagans had many other religious traditions,
  some of which they acquired in early times from the Jews. They are also said
  to have nurtured their devotional feelings with the books of Psalms, as well
  as with a book filled with moral discourses, supposedly written by Seth who,
  according to the biblical stories, was one of Adam's many sons. Adam was the
  first human being whom God created, by using his own hands, out of mud, which
  he made by mixing dust with water.<br>
  <br>
  Muhammad's transfer to his uncle's household did not bring him any relief from
  what he suffered in his grandfather's house. Abu Taleb was not rich, either,
  but he, too, had a large family. Even though he, in addition to his sacerdotal
  duties of the Ka'aba, had taken to trading to supplement his income, yet he
  did not earn enough to provide for all the needs of his family members.
  Scarcity was a rule, rather than an exception for his family. As the family
  often passed their days in hardship, Muhammad's addition to the family became
  a burden not only for its head, but also for its members. Consequently, they
  made him feel unwelcome in their midst, and used, in his presence, languages
  and gestures, which were good enough to act as salt for the wounds he had
  already acquired from his grandfather's house.<br>
  <br>
  Abu Taleb, on his part, was aware of the situation that his nephew had to
  endure in his house. He wanted to help, but he, too, was handicapped; had he
  been able to meet the needs of his immediate family members, he could have
  justified Muhammad's presence in his house, but that was not the case and,
  consequently, he could do nothing for him, but to play the role of a
  spectator. When he could live no more with his nephew's agonizing conditions,
  he found him a job of a shepherd.<br>
  His job required him to take his employers' camels into the plains for
  grazing. He&nbsp;&nbsp; thus had to spend, all by himself, the major portion
  of his days in the grim desert outside of Mecca. Letting the camels roam about
  in search of a thorn or a blade of grass among the pile of stones, we can
  visualize how a young, sensitive and intelligent boy of the age of Muhammad,
  must have spent his time.<br>
  <br>
  It is a rule of nature that misfortune and sufferings create bitterness in a
  person and these make him conscious of his situation, especially when he finds
  himself with nothing to distract him from his thoughts. Such a person grieves
  over his misfortune and tries to find out its causes. While doing so, he
  develops a strange internal feeling, which can be described only by a person
  who had undergone such an experience in his or her own life.<br>
  <br>
  Since the above observation amply applied to young Muhammad, we may safely
  conjecture that in the midst of his frustrating loneliness, he must have asked
  himself why he had come into the world as a fatherless orphan, and why he had
  to work as a shepherd at such a lonely place at such a young age, while other
  children of his age were spending their time in the company of their loving
  parents. He must also have asked himself why his mother had to leave him at
  the mercy of the people he hardly knew, and why their treatment of him was
  different from that of their own children.<br>
  Despite the fact that he brought in some income to his uncle's family, yet
  they continued to treat him in the manner of the past. The continuity of their
  past behavior hurt him deeply; its resultant pains being the major cause for
  deepening his hatred towards his mother. He believed that if he had been
  living with her, nobody would have subjected him to the degrading insults that
  he suffered from at his grandfather's house, and which continued to be heaped
  upon on him at his uncle's house. He held his mother responsible for all of
  his sufferings.<br>
  <br>
  His ego, sensitivity and feelings greatly hurt, Muhammad stopped playing with
  other children in his spare time. Instead, he felt more at home when
  conversing with other people who came to Mecca on pilgrimage or on trade. He
  enjoyed their conversations on religious matters. He also derived immense
  pleasure from their story-telling sessions. Very often, he prompted them into
  narrating the tantalizing and fascinating Arabian tales of the past. Most of
  the tales and fables he heard from them acted like balm for his wounds. When
  he got his opportunity, he narrated them eloquently to his listeners, who, in
  their own turn, made them an important and integral part of the Quran!<br>
  <br>
  When he had no story-telling session to attend, he took immense pleasure in
  watching the arrival and departure of the caravans, which traded in Syria and
  Yemen, and thronged at Mecca before their dispersal. The thought of being in
  foreign lands filled young Muhammad's mind with excitement and carried his
  imagination to things he himself hoped one day to see in those distant
  countries.<br>
  <br>
  Once, Muhammad saw Abu Taleb mount his camel to depart with a caravan bound
  for Syria. Unable to suppress his ardent desire, he begged his uncle to take
  him along on his journey. Abu Taleb could not deny his forceful request and
  gave him permission to accompany the caravan.<br>
  <br>
  The route to Syria, in those days, lay through regions fertile in fables and
  traditions, which it was the delight of the traveling Arabs to recount during
  the evening respites of their caravans. The vastness and solitude of the
  desert in which the wandering Arabs passed so much of their lives was the
  fertile ground that also gave birth to numerous superstitious fancies.
  Accordingly, they had the deserts peopled with good and evil Jinns, and
  clothed them with tales of enchantment, mingled with wonderful but dubious
  events, which, they believed, had taken place in the distant past.<br>
  <br>
  While traveling, the youthful Muhammad doubtless imbibed many of those
  superstitions of the desert. Remaining ingrained in his retentive memory, they
  later played a powerful role over his thoughts and imagination.<br>
  <br>
  We may note here two ancient traditions, out of the many of the Arabian
  legends, which Muhammad must have heard at this time, and which we find
  recounted by him afterwards in the Quran. One of these related to the
  mountainous district called Hadjar.<br>
  <br>
  As caravans crossed the silent and deserted valleys, caravanners gazed at the
  caves at the sides of the mountains. These caves were said to have been once
  inhabited by the Bani Thamud or the Children of Thamud. These people, Arabs
  believed, belonged to one of the lost tribes of Arabia.<br>
  <br>
  Bani Thamud were a proud and gigantic race, existing at the time of patriarch
  Abraham. When they lapsed into idolatry, God sent them a prophet from among
  themselves whose name was Saleh. His task was to restore them to His righteous
  path. People refused to listen to him unless he proved the divinity of his
  mission through a miracle. Saleh prayed, and God caused a rock to open up from
  which came out a gigantic she-camel, producing a foal and abundant milk soon
  after.<br>
  Some of the Thamudites were convinced by the sight of the miracle and gave up
  idolatry. The greater majority of them remained unimpressed and continued in
  their disbelief.<br>
  <br>
  Disappointed, Saleh left the camel among the people as a sign from God, but
  warned them that a catastrophe would befall should they do her any harm. For a
  time, the camel was left to feed quietly in their pastures, but when she drank
  from a brook or a well, she never raised her head until she had drained the
  last drop of water.<br>
  <br>
  In return, it was believed, she produced milk to supply the whole tribe. As
  she, however, frightened other camels out of pastures by her huge size, she
  became an object of offense to the Thamudites who, to get rid of the beast,
  hamstrung and then slew her.<br>
  <br>
  God retaliated for the killing of the she-camel. He caused a fearful cry,
  accompanied by great claps of thunder, to descend upon the Thamudites people
  at night from heaven; in the morning all the offenders were found dead, lying
  prostrated on their faces. Thus for avenging the death of a she-camel, God
  obliterated a whole race from the face of the earth. The land of the
  Thamudites still remains barren, caused by a constant curse from heaven.<br>
  <br>
  This story had a powerful impact on Muhammad's mind, who, in later years,
  refused to let his people encamp in the neighborhood, hurrying them away from
  this accursed region.<br>
  <br>
  Another tradition gathered by Muhammad during one of his journeys related to
  the city of Eyla, situated near the Red Sea. This place, he was told, had been
  inhabited in ancient times by a tribe of the Jews. Like the Thamudites, they
  had lapsed into idolatry. Also, because the tribe had profaned the Sabbath by
  fishing on that sacred day, God transformed their old men into swine, and the
  young ones into monkeys.<br>
  <br>
  What had happened to their womenfolk was not told, so Muhammad necessarily
  remained vague while narrating this story in the Quran.<br>
  <br>
  The aforesaid traditions, among others, are found eloquently described in the
  Quran, thus indicating the extent of the bias to which Muhammad's youthful
  mind had been subjected during his journeys.<br>
  <br>
  Muslim writers have eulogized many wonderful circumstances, which are stated
  to have attended Muhammad throughout all the journeys of his life. He was,
  they assert, hovered over by unseen angels with their wings to protect him
  from the burning sands of the desert and the scorching rays of the sun.<br>
  <br>
  On another occasion, he was protected by a cloud, which hung over his head
  during the noontime heat. On yet another occasion, a withered tree suddenly
  put forth its leaves and blossomed in order to provide shade to the distressed
  Muhammad.<br>
  <br>
  All those miracles did not rest on the evidence of an eyewitness; rather these
  were Muhammad's own statements, or were invented, after his death, by his
  zealot followers, which Muslims are required to believe without ever asking
  any questions.<br>
  <br>
  During his journeys, Muhammad is said to have met a number of Christian
  hermits. Monk Bahira was prominent among them. On conversing with Muhammad,
  Bahira was struck by the precocity of his intellect and became entranced by
  his eager desire for varied information. His inquisitiveness centered,
  principally, on maters of religion. The two were believed to have held
  frequent conversations on the subject, in course of which, the discourse of
  the monk was mainly directed against idolatry, the practice in which the
  youthful Muhammad had hitherto been raised. The Nestorian Christians, for whom
  Bahira was a faithful patron, were strenuous in forbidding the worship of
  images. They prohibited even their casual exhibition. Indeed, they had taken
  their scruples on this matter so far that even the cross, a common emblem of
  Christianity, was included in this prohibition.<br>
  <br>
  Muslim writers stress the point that Bahira had become interested in the
  youthful Muhammad because he had seen the seal of prophecy on his shoulders.
  This vision, they swear, gave the monk the conviction that this was the same
  Prophet whose arrival had been foretold in the Christian Scriptures. The monk
  is further reported to have told Abu Talib to ensure that his nephew did not
  fall into the hands of the Jews, thereby forecasting with the eye of prophecy
  the trouble and opposition that Muhammad was destined to encounter in future
  from that religious group of people.<br>
  We doubt if the mentioned encounter had ever taken place. Supposing that it
  had actually taken place, in that event, the purpose of Bahira's encounter
  must have revolved around one of his own agendas. Since the monk was engaged
  in a mission and predisposed toward proselytizing, he, being a sectarian
  preacher, needed no miraculous sign to develop an interest in an intelligent
  and intense Muhammad, and to attempt to convert him to the beliefs he was then
  propagating. He knew that his subject was a receptive listener; and he was
  also the nephew of the guardian of Ka'aba. He also knew that if he succeeded
  in implanting the seeds of his teachings into Muhammad's tender mind, he would
  be spreading, through him, the doctrines of his sect among the people of
  Mecca, thus advancing his mission by a great stride. This was a good
  motivation for Bahira to develop an interest in Muhammad. He did not have to
  see the putative seal of prophecy in order to be convinced with his subject's
  potentiality and usefulness.<br>
  <br>
  What the monk is reported to have told Abu Talib about Muhammad must have been
  a precautionary suggestion. In the unsettled state of religious opinions then
  obtaining in the Arabian Peninsula, the monk wanted to prevent his would-be
  convert from being engulfed by the Jewish faith, which was then influencing
  the pagans in its favor. Had it happened; the monk would have lost a good
  candidate for his faith, and this would have been a great setback for the
  cause he was then duty-bound to promote.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  With Abu Talib, Muhammad returned to Mecca, his mind teeming with wild tales
  and traditions he picked up during his journey through the desert. He remained
  deeply impressed by the doctrines imparted to him by Monk Bahira in the
  Nestorian monastery, which, as we will note shortly, had helped him
  tremendously later in his life in shaping his own thoughts and religious
  doctrines.<br>
  <br>
  Muhammad had also developed a mysterious reverence for Syria, believing it to
  have given refuge to the patriarch Abraham when he had fled from Chaldea,
  taking with him the doctrine of worshipping one true God. His veneration of
  this country was so deep that he is said to have initially faced Syria (Ibn
  Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah, as translated by A. Guillaume, p. 135), while
  saying his three daily prayers.<br>
  <br>
  While not traveling with a caravan, Muhammad worked as a shepherd. But when he
  reached his manhood, different persons employed him as their commercial agent,
  to be with their trade caravans, which traveled to Syria, the Yemen and other
  destinations on commercial pursuits. The fact that he was given charge of
  trade by his employers negates the Muslim claim that Muhammad was an
  illiterate person and, therefore, he could not have said or written what the
  Quran contains. A person unable to read or write could not have been given the
  important post of a commercial agent, especially, when other Meccans are
  claimed to have been able to do so. His ability to read and write must also
  have helped him to get his jobs, for it was in the best interest of his
  employers to hire someone who was able to keep a written record of the trade
  activities he engaged himself in, particularly in a situation where he had to
  travel to, and live in, distant places for a long period of time.<br>
  <br>
  During his journey through Jerusalem, Muhammad had the opportunity of seeing
  the Temple of Solomon, located on the hill of Moriah. King Solomon had built
  it for Yahweh, who was one among many gods of the ancient people. In the Quran,
  this Temple is referred to as the Farthest Mosque (Masjid-ul-Aqsa). His
  familiarity with this temple helped him later to describe it vividly when
  questioned about his alleged ascension to Seventh Heaven during a night.<br>
  <br>
  Muslims firmly believe that Muhammad landed here on his wonder horse, known as
  Burraq, and walked across the plaza - built by Herod to expand the area of the
  Second Temple - and then ascended to heaven during a night to hold talks with
  God. When asked to describe the temple in order to prove his claim of the
  mysterious ascension, God, it said, presented its replica in his vision to
  enable him to satisfy the incredulity of his Meccan tormentors. During their
  rule over Jerusalem, Muslims built, near the Temple of Solomon, a mosque known
  as the Dome of Rock, to commemorate the ascension. It is also called the
  Mosque of Hadhrat Umar. This has become the third holiest Muslim place of
  worship after the Ka'aba in Mecca and the Mosque of the Prophet in Madina.<br>
  <br>
  King Solomon was the person who had first used the oft-repeated Muslim
  invocation of God's glory in a letter that he is said to have written to Queen
  Bilquis of Sheba, some seventeen hundred centuries before the advent of Islam.
  The invocation, reading as follows, are now used by all Muslims every day
  before they do anything in their lives:<br>
  <br>
  Bismillah hir Rahman nur Rahim, meaning: In the name of Allah, the Most
  Gracious, Most Merciful.<br>
  <br>
  We suspect that the pagans used the same invocation before their idol Allah.
  Muhammad lifted it from the pagan practice and made it an essential component
  of his religion.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Before we proceed further with our narrative, we may pause here and discuss
  briefly a psychological theory or observation. It is known that belief can
  blunt human reasoning and common sense. It has been established that ideas,
  which have been inculcated into a person's mind in childhood, remain in the
  background of his thinking forever. Consequently, such a person will want to
  make facts conform to his indoctrinated ideas, which may have no rational
  validity. Many learned scholars are known to have remained handicapped by this
  burden, and inhibited from using their common sense. It is not that they never
  used their common sense in religious enterprises; they used it only when it
  corroborated with their inculcated ideas.<br>
  <br>
  Mankind's faculties of perception and rationalization have enabled them to
  find solution of scientific problems, but in matters of religious and
  political beliefs, the same species is willing to trample on the evidence of
  reason and senses.</p>
