                                perform their yearly pilgrimage. Known as hajj, 
                                it requires each pilgrim to sacrifice at least 
                                one animal before it is declared complete. 
                                Others, who will not be able to go to Mecca for 
                                any reason, will slaughter a large number of 
                                animals in their home countries in the name of 
                                Allah. </p>

                                known if an objective study was ever carried out 
                                to find out what impact these rituals have been

                                to draw Muslims’ attention to the baneful effect 
                                that hajj and the ritual of killing numerous 
                                animals to please Allah have been having on

                                Actually, if we read carefully the Quran through 
                                which Muslims have been instructed to perform 
                                hajj at least once in their lifetime, we will 
                                find that hajj was made obligatory only for the 
                                Muslims of the Arabian Peninsula. Not only that, 
                                even its entire contents and the religion of 
                                Islam were also intended only for them, and not 
                                for anyone else. The following verse of the 
                                Quran supports this fact:</p>

                                The speaker in the verse is Allah<i>.</i> His

                                inspiration, as mentioned in the verse, is 
                                clear: He wanted him to preach the gospels of 
                                his religion only to the Arabs, who lived in 
                                Mecca and all around her. Because the religion 
                                of Islam was designed exclusively for those 
                                people, Allah revealed the contents of the Quran 
                                to Muhammad only in Arabic so that they could 
                                understand them without facing any difficulty.</p>

                                Mr. X, a Muslim from Calcutta, decided to 
                                perform his hajj, say, in the 14<sup>th</sup> 
                                century, when almost all of India had fallen to 
                                the Muslim rulers. After reaching Bombay, he 
                                fell sick. As instructed by the Quran, he is now 
                                in need of sending an offering to Mecca for 
                                sacrifice there on his behalf. </p>

                                are expected to make their country poorer in 
                                2005 by approximately $325 Million Dollars. This 
                                will happen, despite the fact that most of this 
                                money is likely to come from those wage-earners 
                                who toil day and night in foreign lands to earn 
                                a few hundred dollars a month. Bangladeshis will 
                                squander this huge amount of money, despite the 
                                fact that a large number of its people, living 
                                in its northern part, do not get any food, when 
                                suffering from <i>monga</i>, to feed themselves 
                                and their children. This colossal wastage will 
                                take place, despite the fact that many of its 
                                farmers do not have a pair of oxen to till their 
                                lands. </p>

                                I urge all patriotic Muslims of Bangladesh to 
                                rise up and to stop their ill-informed brethren 
                                from squandering their meager resources on 
                                rituals that their religion does require them to 
                                perform. I urge them to stand up and ask their 
                                government not only to discourage its citizens 
                                from undertaking hajj but also to prevent its 
                                officials, including the Prime Minister, from 
                                performing Umra every now and then at the cost 
                                of the people. </p>

                                I believe that Bangladesh can overcome its 
                                present situation, if its people are motivated 
                                to stand up against all kinds of wastages. Like 
                                the rituals of hajj and Qurbani, corruption has 
                                also been eating into their nation’s vital 
                                economic veins. By plugging only these two 
                                dangerous drains of wastage and plunder, they 
                                can save for themselves at least a billion 
                                dollars a year. And with this huge sum of money, 
                                they can, over a period of time, not only free 
                                their country from its abject poverty, this 
                                would also save them from all kinds of 
                                humiliations they have been suffering regularly 
                                at the hands of their donors.</p>
