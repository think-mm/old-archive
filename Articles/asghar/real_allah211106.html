	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">Ever 
	since I started reading the Quran some twenty years ago, I have been trying 
	to find out the identity of the Allah, who had revealed its contents to 
	Muhammad. This question arose in my mind because I found Him describing 
	Himself as I, He, Me and We in the Quran. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">My 
	wonderment came to an end when I stumbled on a verse in Sura Az-Zumar, or 
	the Crowds while writing my commentary or Tafsir of the Quran. From the 
	contents of the verse, I concluded that the Muslims’ Allah is none but 
	Muhammad himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">My 
	commentary is reproduced hereunder. I am sure readers will agree with my 
	finding, but should they find any discrepancy in it, I will like to know 
	about it so that I may be able to correct myself after a thorough 
	discussion. </p>

	that occurs in verse 71, and again, in verse 73. It is a Meccan Sura, but 
	some authorities think verses 53 and 54 were revealed in Medina. The entire

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">He

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">“<i>Is 
	it not to Allah that sincere devotion is due?” But those who take for 
	protectors others than Allah (say): “We only serve them in order that they 
	may bring us nearer to Allah.” Truly Allah will judge between them in that 
	wherein they differ. But Allah guides not such as are false and ungrateful</i>.”<a name="_ftnref3" title href="#_ftn3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[3]</span></span></a>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">As we 
	know, the Quraish polytheists believed in Allah, whose symbol they preserved 
	in Ka’aba in the form of a statue. They believed that it was Allah who 
	created the heavens and earth and subdued the sun and the moon.<a name="_ftnref4" title href="#_ftn4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[4]</span></span></a> 
	Because they thought He was beyond their reach, they needed the help of some 
	other deities to bring Him nearer to them. That is why they prayed to 
	al-Lat, al-Manat and al-Uzza - supposedly His daughters - to intervene on 
	their behalf and bring Him nearer to them. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">The 
	Quraish polytheists’ attempt to reach their deity was not, in actuality, any 
	different from the basic, but unpronounced, concept of Islam. Muslims need 
	to follow in toto what Muhammad has said in the Quran to save themselves 
	from the difficulties of their earthly lives. It is only by following his 
	directives, as he gave them through the Quran, will they be able to avoid 
	the Fire of Hell in the world hereafter.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">In 
	other words, Muslims can earn the pleasure of Allah, if He is some one other 
	than Muhammad himself, by following Muhammad’s words and deeds. This they 
	have inferred from the Quran. This inference has led them to make Muhammad 
	synonymous with Allah. That is why they repeat umpteen times in their lives 
	that he is Allah’s Prophet in order for them to remain Muslims. That is why 
	they invoke his name, along with Allah’s, in most of their prayers. That is 
	why they pay more respects to him than to Allah. That is why they flock to 
	his grave in Medina to earn his blessings. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Muhammad did not appreciate what the Pagans had told him about they were 
	using to bring Allah nearer to them. Instead, he threatened to judge them 
	harshly for differing with him on how to achieve Allah’s nearness. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">To 
	make sure that the polytheists had understood who the real Allah was, 
	Muhammad told them:</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">“<i>If 
	ye reject (Allah), truly Allah hath no need of you; but He liketh not 
	ingratitude from His servants: if ye are grateful, He is pleased with you. 
	No bearer of burdens can bear the burden of another. In the end, to your 
	Lord is your Return, when He will tell you the truth of all that ye did (in 
	this life). For He knoweth well all that is in (men’s) hearts</i>.”<a name="_ftnref5" title href="#_ftn5"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[5]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Hinting that he was like other men, with likes and dislikes of his own, 
	Muhammad told them that it did not matter to him whether or not they thanked 
	him, but if they gave him thanks, he will accept them. Referring to the 
	idols, or the symbols the polytheists worshipped with the hope of bringing 
	Allah nearer to them, he told them that those idols will not be able to help 
	themselves, as they had their own burdens to worry about. Through this 
	statement, he reinforced his belief that the idols had life and that they 
	will be judged by him or Allah on the Day of Judgment. </p>

	Muhammad withdrew from a discussion he was having with the Pagans of Mecca, 
	telling them, ‘you worship whoever you like, but you will be the one who 
	will be losing not only yourselves, but also your kith and kin on the Day of 
	Judgment.’ This apparently gentle and humane statement of Muhammad should 
	not mislead us into believing that he was a gentle and kind man, as he had 
	made this statement at a time when he was powerless, and was struggling to 
	establish himself as a prophet of Allah. He had to be reconciliatory in his 
	tones and statements towards the Pagans, as any threat of physical violence 
	against them would have backfired, and the Pagans’ would have brought his 
	life and his mission to an end.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">Had it 
	been Medina, we would have read a different statement from Muhammad. After 
	his arrival here, he remained a powerless man for some time, with only a 
	handful of men at his command. This had compelled him to maintain a friendly 
	and cordial relationship with the city’s Jewish and Pagan inhabitants.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">But 
	from the statements he had made sometime after his arrival in Medina, we can 
	see a transformation taking place in his personality with the gradual 
	increase in the number of his followers. Bolstered by their support, he 
	transformed himself from a “peaceful man of Mecca” to a “highly violent man 
	of Medina” in order to steamroll his will on his Jewish and other opponents. 
	Here, he proved that he was truly a brutal dictator, with all the traits of 
	extremely sadistic desires ingrained in his mind!</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">Asking

	Muhammad also told them:</p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">“<i>Those

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">This 
	statement came from a man who claimed that nobody would be able to corrupt 
	the contents of the Quran, as he has preserved them on a solid tablet, which 
	he keeps under his constant watch. At the time of making the said claim, he 
	did not know that smart people will be able to understand what inanities the 
	Quran carried and then trash its contents forever. But at a later stage, 
	this reality downed on him, and he tried to amend his mistake by asking the 
	people to follow the best they found in them. He admitted that the words he 
	has used have not-so-good connotations.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">Before 
	his confession could soothe his opponents, Muhammad dropped a bombshell on 
	them by declaring:</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">“<i>Allah 
	has revealed (from time to time) the most beautiful message in the form of a 
	Book, consistent with itself, (yet) repeating (its teaching in various 
	aspects): the skins of those who fear their Lord tremble thereat; then their 
	skins and their hearts do soften to the celebrations of Allah’s praises. 
	Such is the guidance of Allah: He guides therewith whom He pleases, but such 
	as Allah leaves to astray, can have none to guide</i>.”<a name="_ftnref11" title href="#_ftn11"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[11]</span></span></a></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">To 
	reaffirm that Muhammad had a sick mind, I do not have to go any further than 
	the above verse. The Book he has referred to is the same Book that he had 
	compiled before the creation of the universe, and which he has preserved in 
	his custody to ensure that humans could not corrupt it for achieving their 
	selfish goals. The Torah, also known as “The Law,” the Bible, also known as 
	“Injil” to the Muslims as well as the Quran are its true copies. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Muhammad revealed, through some selected men, and from time to time, the 
	contents of the celestial Book to the people on earth. The first copy to 
	arrive on earth was known as Zabur. It had come to Abraham, or Ibrahim, as 
	the Muslims call him, but it has become extinct. The second copy (Torah) 
	came to Moses, or Musa, as he is called by the Muslims. The third copy 
	(Injil) came to Jesus Christ, who is known as Issa to the Muslims. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">After 
	the Jews (the followers of Moses) corrupted and interpolated the Torah with 
	their own words, Muhammad sent Injil to Jesus Christ to correct what had 
	gone wrong in the Torah. But when the followers of Christ did the same thing 
	to the Injil, he sent the Quran to himself, repeating in it what he had 
	mentioned in all the three earlier copies of the original Quran. Its fourth 
	copy, also called “The Quran” still retains its pristine origin, as nobody 
	has yet been able to corrupt its messages. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">This 
	un-corrupted and un-adulterated Quran calls upon the Muslims to “fight and 
	slay the Pagans wherever they find them,” and to “seize them, beleaguer them 
	and (to) lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war),”<a name="_ftnref12" title href="#_ftn12"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[12]</span></span></a> 
	as they had allegedly broken their covenant with Muhammad.&nbsp; It also requires 
	the Muslims not to take the Jews and the Christians as their friends or 
	protectors, as it says, they are friends of each other.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Despite all the messages of hatred and destruction it has, Muhammad claimed 
	that his Quran carries most beautiful messages for humanity. If what I have 
	quoted from the Quran are the beautiful messages, then I have nothing else 
	to call ugly and violent. In keeping with the definition of beauty Muhammad 
	gave us, I should also put the massacre of the Jews and their expulsion from 
	Medina by him into the category of beautiful things he had done in his

	Muhammad’s view of the world and its population, as he saw then, was myopic 
	and it is evident from his statements that are recorded in the Quran. Also 
	his allusion that its contents were intended to guide all the people of the 
	world to a path, he thought, was righteous was the outcome of delusions he 
	suffered from in his life. Had these not been the reasons for him to claim 
	that he was an apostle for the entire mankind, what other factors could have 
	made him make this claim, given the fact that:</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">-in 
	comparison to the total population of the world in the 7<sup>th</sup> 
	century, the population of the Arabian Peninsula must have remained very 
	negligible. I am saying this because, giving him the benefit of doubt, I 
	would like to believe that through the phrase “The Mother of Cities and all 
	around her” that he has used in verse 42:7, he might have referred to the 
	whole of the Arabian Peninsula. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">-the 
	Arabian Peninsula of Muhammad’s time exists no more. It has been divided 
	into seven independent states, which are: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, 
	Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the Yemen. The total number of their 
	native people stands at about 52 millions today. All of their people speak 
	Arabic. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">-if 
	the world’s population in 2006 has reached 6.5 billion, then the percentage 
	of the Arabic speaking people of the truncated Arabian Peninsula is just

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	-relying on the brief statistics I have presented, it can be safely 
	concluded that Muhammad had revealed the Quran in Arabic for the 
	understanding of only 8 percent of the world’s population. But if I lump the 
	Arabic speaking people of other Middle Eastern countries and beyond with the 
	people of all the countries of the Arabian Peninsula, then the total 
	percentage of the people who can read and understand the Quran should stand 
	between 17 to 20 percent of the globe’s population. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">-this 
	means that over 80 percent of the world’s inhabitants cannot benefit from 
	what is written in the Arabic Quran, unless, of course, all of them start 
	learning, and mastering the Arabic of the Quran.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">By 
	depriving such a huge number of humans from the benefit of the Quran, not 
	even an insane person could claim that he was an apostle for “all humanity” 
	on earth. If Muhammad was not insane, then why, and under what 
	circumstances, did he make such an important proclamation?</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">As I 
	have understood, Muhammad had no grand scheme for himself and the Arabian 
	Peninsula when he began his movement other than to take over the custody of 
	the Ka’aba and to force Mecca’s rich community to share their wealth with 
	him. In other words, Mecca was his prime focus and his ‘world.’ This is 
	evident from various verses of the Quran. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">But 
	his focus and his “world” changed after he arrived in Medina. Made very 
	angry by his displacement and loss of belongings that he had in Mecca, he 
	targeted the Pagan caravans to vent his anger, and to recoup his losses. His 
	success at Badr was the first stepping stone, which emboldened him greatly. 
	It also brought many indigent people from Medina to his camp with 
	willingness to do anything he wanted them to do.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">His 
	success at bringing the Jews of Medina to their knees provided him the 
	greatest impetus he needed not only for acquiring much power and wealth, but 
	also to look beyond its peripheries. To justify his incursions into the 
	territories that were close to the boundaries of Medina, he had to designate 
	himself as a prophet for the entire humanity, a designation that required 
	him to amend the ways of life of those people whose lands he wanted to 
	conquer either by deceit or force.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">The 
	word “humanity,” or “mankind,” therefore, had a limited scope and 
	implication for Muhammad. He used it strictly to denote either those people 
	he was amongst, or those people he was going to bring into his fold, or 
	those people with whom he had some problems, as it can be noted from verse 
	114:6 of the Quran. He did not use the word “Nas,” or “mankind” in the sense 
	we use it in our conversations and writings. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">His 
	assertion that he has revealed the Quran in Arabic is the clue I have relied 
	on to draw my conclusion. It lends the support I needed to establish my 
	point of view.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Together with threatening his opponents, most of whom were Pagans, with the 
	punishments of hell fire for their opposition of him, Muhammad also offered 
	them an olive branch by promising to “turn off from them (even) the worst in 
	their deeds,”<a name="_ftnref16" title href="#_ftn16"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[16]</span></span></a> 
	if they submitted to his dictums. Instead of accepting his offer, they 
	“frightened” him with the wraths of their Allah.<a name="_ftnref17" title href="#_ftn17"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[17]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">Having 
	absolute confidence in his own ability and strength to come out successful 
	against all of his opponents, he declared: </p>

	ignominies that Muhammad had predicted for them; they did befall them, and 
	their victims paid a high price for frightening him with the wraths of their 
	Allah who, it seems, proved helpless and ineffective in the face of 
	Muhammad’s might and manipulations. </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">To

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">Not

	to himself the exclusive right to decide who, on the Day of Judgment, will 
	intercede on their behalf with the Allah who was superior to him. In this 
	connection, he told his listeners:</p>

	(intercessors) have no power whatever and no intelligence.” This means that 
	only the Allah Muhammad said he was representing on earth has the power and

	to Allah; to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and in 
	the end, to whom all shall be brought back.’ </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">With

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Intercession in the next world with a Supreme Deity was one of the beliefs 
	of the Pagans, and Muhammad grew up with this belief in his mind. The Meccan 
	Pagans believed that this Allah protected them, as well as those who came to 
	His shrine and sought His protection. Muhammad had no problem with this 
	Allah; his problem lied with His symbol or statue, which the Pagans had 
	installed in Ka’aba to bring Him nearer to them. In fact, he believed he was 
	an ardent servant of this Allah, who had sent him to the Meccan Pagans to 
	bring them to His true path. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Allah’s statue appeared to Muhammad like that of a human being, but without 
	eyes, ears, nose, mouth, hands and legs etc. In his mind, the depiction of 
	Allah without limbs was an insult to Him. But while propagating his idea of 
	the real Allah with all the limbs he faced a major problem in that he had 
	never seen Him in person, and as such, it prevented him from describing His 
	features when demanded by his opponents. To overcome his problem, he turned 
	the Allah of Mecca into an amorphous being. This enabled him to talk 
	extensively about Him without having to describe His gender or appearance.
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">But 
	while doing so, Muhammad also abolished those deities of the Pagans who they 
	worshipped in the hope that they would, on their behalf, intercede with 
	Allah. This angered the Pagans.&nbsp; He tried to address their anger by telling 
	them that as intercession had not benefited the Jews, it was not going to 
	benefit them either.<a name="_ftnref21" title href="#_ftn21"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[21]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">The 
	Pagans refused to buy his argument. Eager to win their confidence, he tried 
	to put them off by telling them that as nobody will be able to intercede 
	with Allah without His permission,<a name="_ftnref22" title href="#_ftn22"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[22]</span></span></a> 
	it was useless to have intercessors without knowing whether or not they will 
	be able to intercede with Him. To prove his point, he told them that “those 
	who sustain {his} Throne and those around it … will implore his forgiveness 
	for those who believe…,<a name="_ftnref23" title href="#_ftn23"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[23]</span></span></a>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">Since 
	Muhammad could not rest without bringing the Pagans to his side, he 
	introduced them to Ar-Rahman, a deity of the Yemenites, who, his worshippers 
	believed, was Most Gracious and Most Merciful, thus doing away with the 
	necessity of having any intercessors to obtain His pleasure. When the Pagans 
	asked him what or who this Ar-Rahman was,<a name="_ftnref24" title href="#_ftn24"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[24]</span></span></a>

	Unless it is proven that the words “O my Servants” were the outcome of a 
	slip of tongue, this address of Muhammad fully supports my contention that 
	Allah was none but Muhammad. In his capacity of Allah, he demanded that all 
	men must worship him to earn their salvation on the Day of Judgment. </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Maulana Abul Ala Mududi was one of the few Muslim scholars who was able to 
	understand the true and devastating implication of the words “O my 
	Servants.” It was this realization that had made him to come up with the 
	following explanation to save the Quran, nay, Islam, from its certain death:
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">“Some 
	commentators have given a strange interpretation to these words. They say 
	that Allah Himself has commanded the Holy Prophet to address the people as 
	&quot;My servants&quot; therefore, all men are the servants of the Holy Prophet. This 
	interpretation is no interpretation at all but a worst distortion of the 
	meaning of the Qur'an and indeed tampering with the Word of Allah. If this 
	interpretation were correct, it would falsify and negate the whole Qur'an. 
	For the Qur'an, from the beginning to the end, establishes the concept that 
	men are the servants of Allah alone, and its whole message revolves around 
	the point that they should serve none but One Allah alone. The Holy Prophet 
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) himself was Allah's servant. Allah had sent him 
	not as rabb (sustainer, providence) but as a Messenger so that he should 
	himself serve Him and teach the other people also to serve Him alone. After 
	all, how can a sensible person believe that the Holy Prophet might have one 
	day stood up before the disbelieving Quraish of Makkah and made the sudden 
	proclamation: &quot;You are in fact the slaves of Muhammad and not of al- `Uzzah 
	and ash-Shams.&quot; (We seek Allah's refuge from this).””<a name="_ftnref34" title href="#_ftn34"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">[34]</span></span></a>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">In 
	spite of his best effort, Mududi failed to explain why Muhammad or Allah had 
	used the words “O my Servants” in conjunction with the words “turn ye to 
	your Lord (in repentance) and bow to His (Will)” in his address. His failure 
	was caused by either of the following two facts:</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">-he 
	could not believe that Allah could have made a mistake, and/or;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	-Muhammad himself was Allah and, as a human being, he was susceptible to 
	making mistakes in his utterances and actions. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">
	Accepting either of the two scenarios would have destroyed Mududi’s 
	religion. Therefore, he tried to defend the Quran by accusing other 
	commentators of misinterpreting verse 39: 53. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.4pt">If the 
	commentators have misinterpreted it, then what is its correct 
	interpretation? </p>
