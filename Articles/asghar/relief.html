                                  flood victims of Bangladesh. I agree with your
                                  appeal, and also support it. But having myself
                                  once been involved in the distribution of
                                  relief, I know how it works in Bangladesh.
                                  Relief in Bangladesh are generally used to
                                  fatten the fat cats; to advance political
                                  careers and to elevate social status. If not
                                  most but a large portion of the relief
                                  materials that come from abroad does not reach
                                  the really effected people. If not all but the
                                  larger&nbsp;part of the money is pocketed by
                                  politicians, local leaders and the goons they
                                  nurture for their own benefits.

                                    doors of the building remained locked and
                                    hundreds of the victims had to take shelter
                                    in the veranda or in the open ground of the
                                    institutions. “We are soaked if there
                                    is rain and we are burned if there is sun,”
                                    said Mobarak Miah who has come from
                                    Keraniganj with his wife and four children
                                    as his thatched house had gone under water

                                    managing about 1,500 people who had taken
                                    shelter in the centre as they had received
                                    nothing from the city corporation.<br>

                                    Although there were policemen to ensure
                                    security in the centre, no physicians were
                                    found on duty. Nazimuddin said a doctor or

                                    centre with a supply of medicine including

                                    were infected by diarrhoea on Thursday
                                    morning. We requested the relief workers for
                                    some saline but all they did was to show us

                                    who had to look alone after her babies as

                                    Before handing out our hard-earned money to
                                    unknown persons or organizations, we must
                                    ensure that what we are giving them would
                                    reach the flood victims. We must also ensure
                                    that the distributors of the relief do not
                                    squander most of it for their personal
                                    purposes.
