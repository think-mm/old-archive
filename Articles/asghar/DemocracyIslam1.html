  <font size="5">Democracy is an Alien Concept for Islam: Part-1</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center; line-height: 150%">
  <b><font size="4">By
  <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/asghar/index.html">Mohammad Asghar</a></font></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;(<i><b><font size="2">Author’s 
  note: To find out whether or not democracy is compatible with Islam, it is 
  necessary for me to describe first those concepts based on which this religion 
  was founded 1,400 years ago. Understanding its founder’s ken of knowledge and 
  the limited purpose to achieve which he had set up Islam in the middle of a 
  desert are also crucial. I have, therefore, begun this article with a short 
  discussion on Islam’s limitations and some of the weird concepts it propounds 
  with a demand placed on its adherents to adhere to them to make their life 
  good and meaningful</font></b></i>).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  No religion on earth is free from controversy. Each one of them has numerous 
  doctrines and principles, most of which are redundant for the time we are now 
  living in. This redundancy arose from the fact that all the major religions of 
  the world were founded by ignorant people in the eras, when the thinking 
  abilities of common folks were not as good as these are today. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  Take, for example, the so-called god-like qualities of Jesus Christ. Islam 
  claims that he had begun talking to people immediately after his birth. His 
  god-like qualities brought visitors from distant lands to pay him homage. 
  After his adoptive father took him to Egypt to escape persecution at the place 
  of his birth, his god-like nature disappeared or went into a long hibernation. 
  It, however, resurrected only when he returned to Israel to bewilder those who 
  were likely not only to dispute him; many among them were also willing to kill 
  him for blaspheming their Jewish faith.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  Islam also infers that Jesus Christ enjoyed more favors from God than did 
  Muhammad, its founder. While Muhammad looted the Arabian caravans, killed and 
  plundered the Jews to feed his hungry followers, God sent food from heaven, at 
  Christ’s behest, to save his followers from starvation (Quran; 5:117, 118). 
  While Muhammad died on earth and remains buried in the sandy soil of Medina, 
  God lifted a living Jesus Christ to heaven, where he continues to live in 
  God’s presence even today. He has been enjoying all the felicities of heaven, 
  including the companionship of numerous houris from the day he entered it, 
  whereas Muhammad would meet God, and begin enjoying all of its good things 
  only after being resurrected on the Day of Judgment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  In the past, people hardly raised questions on the above anomalies; but they 
  have started doing it now. This change in people’s attitude is the result of 
  the thinking ability they have been able to achieve for themselves over a long 
  period of time. With their newly acquired abilities and knowledge, many people 
  have been weighing in all the religions of the world with a new and different 
  standard in order to find out if what the religions have been teaching their 
  adherents for thousands of years are really beneficial for them as well as for 
  their other compatriots. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  &nbsp;In this article, I intend to highlight some important aspects of Islam. I 
  have selected Islam as a subject of my discussion not because I have an extra 
  ax to grind against it, but on account of the fact that it is the youngest 
  among the three main religions of the world and also because of the fact that 
  it claims to be the best and most perfect religion for all mankind. But before 
  laying out my case against Islam and its baneful effects on humanity, I want 
  to discuss briefly whether or not God is an All-knowing Being, and also, if He 
  was the real founder of Islam.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left; line-height: 150%">
  <b><i><font size="4">Allah is not All-Knowing?</font></i></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  &nbsp;The Quran is replete with verses that claim that Allah - - the Muslim God - - 
  is not only Kind, Generous, Magnanimous, Forgiving and the Sustainer of 
  mankind; He is also All-Knowing. As Islam was founded on a doctrine that 
  claims that what the Quran contains are the words of Allah, Muslims are 
  required to believe in all of its claims, without ever trying to find out 
  their truthfulness. In fact, Islam forbids its followers from developing in 
  them an ability to search for, or to inquire into anything that are related to 
  their faith. The Quran makes this point very clear: all Muslims must believe 
  in the Unseen (2:2) in order to become, and to remain Muslims, for, ‘blindness 
  and ignorance’ are the basic ingredients of their faith.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  &nbsp;Had not their religion made them blind, Muslims would have found out a long 
  time ago from the Quran itself that what their Allah has claimed in it about 
  His Omniscience was an outright lie. Here is what He Himself has said about 
  the ken of His knowledge:&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  <i>“What! Have they partners (in godhead), who have established for them some 
  religion without the permission of Allah? Had it not been for the Decree of 
  Judgment, the matter would have been decided between them (at once): but 
  verily the wrong-doers will have a grievous Penalty”</i> (Quran; 42:21). </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  It is clear from the above passage of the Quran that some people in the time 
  of Muhammad had established a different religion other than Islam for 
  themselves, and Allah did not know about it. He would have known about it, had 
  the concerned people sought His permission before setting up their religion. 
  Since they had not sought His permission in advance, Allah did not know about 
  the existence of another religion.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  When someone told Allah (or was it Muhammad?) about the unauthorized action of 
  some people, He was totally taken aback. His utter surprise is discernible 
  from the way He has expressed Himself by the word “What” in the verse!</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  For a thinking people, the above passage of the Quran would have been a good 
  ground to dismiss its divine origin, but it is unfortunately not the case with 
  the Muslims. Many of them know very well about the presence of this and other 
  verses, like it, in the Quran, but none of them has ever tried to grasp their 
  true meaning and significance, fearing loss of their faith. And this fear is 
  what has been keeping them tied to Islam, despite the fact that it is laden 
  with numerous incongruities and inanities.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left; line-height: 150%">
  <b><i><font size="4">Can an ignorant Allah establish a religion for the entire 
  mankind?</font></i></b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  The answer to the question is an empathetic No. Though there was no reason to 
  believe that God or Allah, if He ever existed, went around the earth, 
  distributing different religions over different periods of time to different 
  people of the world, yet Muslims believe that that is exactly what He had done 
  until the early part of the seventh century. He created one religion first for 
  the entire mankind. They distorted it to fulfill their needs. To turn His 
  defeat into a success, He established another religion. Humans again turned it 
  upside down. Frustrated, Allah established Islam, His final religion. Learning 
  from His past mistakes, He took all precautionary measures to protect His 
  latest religion from being corrupted by its followers. Consequently, Muslims 
  not only believe, they also proclaim proudly that theirs is the only religion 
  in the world that maintains its pristine nature, even though it has been 
  existing among the Muslims for almost fourteen hundred years. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  But is it true that Allah had established Islam for the entire population of 
  the world? Did He make such a claim through the Quran? To find answers to 
  these questions, let us read what the following Quranic verse, which says:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  <i>“Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Quran: That thou mayest 
  warn the Mother of Cities and all around her,- and warn (them) of the Day of 
  Assembly, of which there is no doubt: (When) some will be in the Garden, and 
  some in the Blazing Fire”</i> (42:7).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  At the time Allah was in the process of establishing Islam, Mecca appeared to 
  Him as the “Mother of {all} Cities” on earth, even though history tells us 
  that Baghdad in Iraq and Alexandria in Egypt were two of the most advanced, 
  enlightened and prosperous cities of the Arabian and African regions. The 
  belief that Mecca was the Mother of all Cities must have developed in Him out 
  of His ignorance. Had he visited the two great cities of Iraq and Egypt then, 
  He would have held a different view of Mecca. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  His exposure to Baghdad and Alexandria might as well have had induced Him to 
  shift His Meccan Headquarters to either of the two cities in order not only to 
  better the standard of His own life, such a move on His part would also have 
  helped His kindred, then living in Mecca, to become civil and human-like as 
  well. But Allah missed His opportunity, and He still remains bogged down in a 
  city, the citizens of which are even today dependent on charity to support 
  their lives. But Allah is Allah, and there is none who can change His mind or 
  thoughts. So, who are we to express our disgust over His stupidities?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  From the contents of the verse, quoted above, it is apparent that Allah never 
  wanted to make Islam the religion of the entire mankind. He had designed it 
  only for the Arabs; He also did everything possible within His power to 
  promulgate it among them only. Let us evaluate the contents of the above 
  verse, in conjunction with verses 39:28 and 43:3, to find out Islam’s scope, 
  as well as its inapplicability in the life of those humans, who are not Arabs, 
  and who do not live within the boundaries of the Arabian Peninsula. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  Allah has said: {I have sent} an<b> </b>Arabic Quran {to the Arabs} without 
  any crookedness so that they {the Arabs} may guard (against evil) (verse 
  39:28). He also stated clearly that He has “made it an Arabic Quran so that 
  they {the Arabs} may understand it {with ease} (verse 43:3).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  Read the above verses together with verse 42:7, it becomes crystal clear that 
  Allah has sent the Quran only for the benefit of the Arabs. It has no 
  relevance to, or importance for the non-Arabs, as they are not supposed to 
  understand its contents due to their inability to read and understand Arabic. 
  Had He wished the non-Arabs to become Muslims, and to reap its benefits, He 
  would also have sent them Qurans in their own tongues, thus making the 
  understanding of their respective Qurans easier for them. But He has not done 
  so. His failure to come up with Qurans in languages other than Arabic makes it 
  clear: He had no intention of saving the non-Arabs from His wrath, either in 
  this world or in the world hereafter. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  That Islam was intended only for the Arabs is also clear from what is stated 
  clearly in verse 42:7. It asked Muhammad only to “warn the people of Mecca and 
  all around her” of the Day of Assembly. If Allah had any good intention for 
  the other people of the world, He would not have limited Muhammad’s preaching 
  to a limited space; rather He would have made it obligatory for him to go out 
  of it, and to announce His warning among all the people of the world. He has 
  not done so for a simple reason, and it is this: Either He did not know that 
  the world was not confined to Mecca and its vicinity, or He did not want to 
  help the non-Arabs avoid the fire of hell on the Day of Judgment. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  In the light of what the Quran says, the non-Arab Muslims have been carrying 
  the heavy burden of Islam unnecessarily. It is not intended, nor was it 
  designed for their wellbeing. It is, therefore, not helping them, either in 
  their ephemeral life, nor can it be expected to help them in their next life, 
  if there is one to be lived in after their death. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%">
  The sooner the non-Arabs will come out of Islam’s yoke, the better it would be 
  for them. Failure to get themselves rid of this monster soon is likely to make 
  their lives more miserable. So, hurry up, and bury this demon under the ground 
  once for all, for in this action of yours lies not only the salvation of your 
  own generation, it would also ensure a better life for your future generations 
  as well.&nbsp; </p>
