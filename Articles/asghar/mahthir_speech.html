                              of anti-Semitism by quoting a sentence or two out
                              of context from his very long speech.&quot;<br>

                              Despite the fact that I have been recuperating
                              from a recent surgery, I could not check myself
                              from writing this rejoinder to put the issues Dr.
                              Habib discussed to their right perspectives. In my
                              effort to do so, I will rely on the official
                              version of Dr. Mahathir's speech, which he
                              delivered at the OIC Conference held on 16th
                              October, 2003 in Malaysia.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir began his speech with the following
                              words:&nbsp; &quot;Alhamdulillah, All Praise be to
                              Allah, by whose Grace and Blessings we, the
                              leaders of the Organisation of Islamic Conference
                              countries are gathered here today to confer and
                              hopefully to plot a course for the future of Islam
                              and the Muslim ummah worldwide.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              The following is clear from Dr. Mahathir's
                              statement: 57 Kings, Sheikhs, Presidents and Prime
                              Ministers came together on October 16, 2003 to
                              &quot;confer and hopefully to plot a course for
                              the future of Islam and the Muslim ummah
                              worldwide.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              Except for plotting a course for the future of
                              Islam and the Muslim Ummah, there was no other
                              agenda for the leaders of 57 countries to discuss,
                              and to agree upon, in a highly important
                              conference that was held in a Muslim State two
                              years after the carnage of September 11, 2001.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir stated: &quot;The whole world is
                              looking at us. Certainly 1.3 billion Muslims,
                              one-sixth of the world's population are placing
                              their hopes in us, in this meeting, even though
                              they may be cynical about our will and capacity to
                              even decide to restore the honour of Islam and the
                              Muslims, much less to free their brothers and
                              sisters from the oppression and humiliation from
                              which they suffer today.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              The Malaysian Prime Minister acknowledged the fact
                              that 1.3 billion Muslims are &quot;cynical about
                              their leaders' will and capacity to even decide to
                              restore the honor of Islam and the Muslims, much
                              less to free their brothers and sisters from the
                              oppression and humiliation from which they suffer
                              today.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              The above observation gives birth to a couple of
                              questions: (1). Are the 1.3 billion Muslims wrong
                              in being cynical about their leaders' will and
                              capacity? (2). How long did it take for the
                              Muslims to develop in them the cynical perceptions
                              of their leaders?<br>
                              <br>
                              The newly resurrected Muslim leader observed:
                              &quot;I will not enumerate the instances of our
                              humiliation and oppression, nor will I once again
                              condemn our detractors and oppressors. It would be
                              an exercise in futility because they are not going
                              to change their attitudes just because we condemn
                              them. If we are to recover our dignity and that of
                              Islam, our religion, it is we who must decide, it
                              is we who must act.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              According to historians, Muslims lost their empire
                              in 1683 A.D., and, as Dr. Mahathir inferred, they
                              became subject of humiliation and oppression
                              following their near disappearance from the
                              world's political, military and economic scenes.&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>
                              Believing that what Dr. Mahathir has asserted is
                              true, I feel inclined to ask: Why Muslims leaders
                              took almost 320 years to realize the plight of
                              their Muslim brothers and sisters?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir exhorted: &quot;To begin with, the
                              Governments of all the Muslim countries can close
                              ranks and have a common stand if not on all
                              issues, at least on some major ones, such as on
                              Palestine. We are all Muslims. We are all
                              oppressed. We are all being humiliated. But we who
                              have been raised by Allah above our fellow Muslims
                              to rule our countries have never really tried to
                              act in concert in order to exhibit at our level
                              the brotherhood and unity that Islam enjoins upon
                              us.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir is a Muslim and he has been ruling
                              Malaysia for almost 22 years. During his long
                              reign, he must have attended a number of OIC
                              Conferences. Since all Muslims, according to him,
                              are being oppressed and humiliated for a long
                              time, his inability to raise this very important
                              issue so forcefully in one of the organization's
                              past conferences is a question that should confuse
                              all those minds, which are able to think
                              logically.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir bemoaned: &quot;But not only are our
                              Governments divided, the Muslim ummah is also
                              divided, and divided again and again. Over the
                              last 1400 years the interpreters of Islam, the
                              learned ones, the ulamas have interpreted and
                              reinterpreted the single Islamic religion brought
                              by Prophet Muhammad S.A.W, so differently that now
                              we have a thousand religions which are often so
                              much at odds with one another that we often fight
                              and kill each other.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              His lamentation continued: &quot;From being a
                              single ummah we have allowed ourselves to be
                              divided into numerous sects, mazhabs and tarikats,
                              each more concerned with claiming to be the true
                              Islam than our oneness as the Islamic ummah.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir has rightly pointed out the true
                              situation that pervades the Islamic world. But,
                              regrettably, he has not mentioned the causes,
                              which are responsible for the creation of the
                              situation. For the sake of our understanding, I
                              humbly ask Dr. Mahathir or any other Muslim leader
                              or Ulema of his caliber to answer the following
                              questions:<br>
                              <br>
                              1. Who are the culprits behind the division of the
                              Islamic governments and the Muslim Umma?<br>
                              2. What caused the Muslim Ulemas to
                              &quot;interpret and reinterpret a single
                              religion&quot; for over 1,400 years?&nbsp;<br>
                              3. When God took extraordinary measures to protect
                              the Quran from being corrupted or interpolated by
                              humans, why did he not take similar measures to
                              prevent its repeated interpretations by the
                              &quot;learned&quot; Ulemas of Islam?<br>
                              4. Why the Quran needs to be interpreted? Did God
                              lack in vocabulary that prevented him from being
                              explicit in his statements? How can one interpret
                              God's words or messages without himself becoming a
                              God, or without having the ability to think on
                              God's level?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                              5. Can we have anyone describe for us the essence
                              of &quot;true Islam&quot; as well as the names of
                              a few people who are practicing it truly and
                              faithfully?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir, the new messiah of Islam claimed:
                              &quot;We fail to notice that our detractors and
                              enemies do not care whether we are true Muslims or
                              not. To them we are all Muslims, followers of a
                              religion and a Prophet whom they declare promotes
                              terrorism, and we are all their sworn enemies.
                              They will attack and kill us, invade our lands,
                              bring down our Governments whether we are Sunnis
                              or Syiahs, Alawait or Druze or whatever. And we
                              aid and abet them by attacking and weakening each
                              other, and sometimes by doing their bidding,
                              acting as their proxies to attack fellow Muslims.
                              We try to bring down our Governments through
                              violence, succeeding to weaken and impoverish our
                              countries.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              In my understanding, no Non-Muslim country
                              &quot;attacked and killed Muslims,&quot; or
                              invaded and grabbed their land after the
                              conclusion of the World War II. The three wars
                              that India fought with Pakistan (over the disputed
                              land of Kashmir and the independence of
                              Bangladesh) and the American invasion of
                              Afghanistan and Iraq are two different stories
                              with two different historical contexts.<br>
                              <br>
                              Anyone who supported Talibanism as well as
                              international terrorism will have enough reasons
                              to condemn America's attack on Afghanistan, but
                              what undisputable ground such a person would have
                              to condemn America for temporarily occupying Iraq?<br>
                              <br>
                              It was the Muslim State of Iraq, which had
                              attacked and fought an almost decade-long war with
                              Iran. In this brutal war, Muslims killed, maimed
                              or incapacitated millions of their own brothers
                              and sisters.<br>
                              <br>
                              It was the Muslim State of Iraq, which had invaded
                              and occupied Kuwait, another Muslim State. Today,
                              America is in Iraq because of the reason that the
                              latter had refused to cease its occupation of Iraq
                              and also due to other reasons that came to the
                              fore after the Gulf War of 1991.<br>
                              <br>
                              Having always preferred peace to violence in my
                              own life, I never liked war; no matter how many
                              solid reasons one might have had in his dossiers
                              to justify its initiation. Still believing that no
                              war has ever solved our problems, I supported our
                              government's move against Saddam Hussain. If we
                              had failed to remove him from power, he would have
                              become a monster and threatened the independence
                              of all of his neighbors in a short period of time.<br>
                              <br>
                              Almost all the countries of the world, including
                              almost all the Muslim nations, held identical
                              opinion of Saddam Hussain. While many among them
                              supported our war with Iraq, others questioned the
                              timing our leadership had thought to be right to
                              remove him from power. As an individual, I had not
                              agreed to the timing, but as an American citizen,
                              I supported our armed forces for the mission they
                              were ordered to accomplish in Iraq. Today, they
                              are in Iraq because with out being there, they
                              could not have removed Saddam Hussain from power.
                              But can our armed forces' presence in Iraq for
                              about eight months be equated with its occupation
                              as well as with the killing of the Muslims,
                              especially in a situation where the erstwhile
                              dictator of Iraq still remains at large?<br>
                              <br>
                              In our war with Iraq, our coalition partners and
                              we have lost 170 soldiers. The Iraqis lost 2,320
                              of their men. Though the loss of a single human
                              life in any hostility is deeply regrettable, yet
                              one can draw satisfaction from the fact that 170
                              of our men shed their blood to ensure the safety
                              of a large number of Muslims, while 2,320 Muslims
                              gave their lives to protect a dictator who not
                              only killed innumerable number of his own people,
                              he was also preparing himself to trample the
                              freedom of all the other Muslim nations of the
                              Middle East.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir has admitted that Muslims not only
                              kill themselves, they also bring down their
                              governments through violence, thus succeeding to
                              weaken and impoverish the Muslim countries.
                              Appreciating his candidness, I need to ask him:<br>
                              <br>
                              1. Does he know how many Shiite Muslims of
                              Pakistan have so far died in the hands of the
                              Sunni Muslims or vice-a-versa?<br>
                              2. Is he willing to identify the enemies of Islam
                              who influenced the Muslims to kill other Muslims?<br>
                              3. Does he know that the number of Shiites killed
                              in Pakistan exceeds the number of the Iraqis
                              killed by the Allied forces in order to remove the
                              pariah of the Arab World?<br>
                              4. Why did he not ever condemn his Sunni brothers
                              for killing the Shiite Muslims in Pakistan?<br>
                              5. Can he explain why Muslims are forced to remove
                              their governments through violence?<br>
                              6. Will he hold ordinary Libyans responsible for
                              removing Gaddafi from power through force, and if
                              their action would further impoverish their
                              country?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir, the scholar of Islam, asserted:
                              &quot;But this is not all that we ignore about the
                              teachings of Islam. We are enjoined to Read, Iqraq
                              i.e. to acquire knowledge. The early Muslims took
                              this to mean translating and studying the works of
                              the Greeks and other scholars before Islam. And
                              these Muslim scholars added to the body of
                              knowledge through their own studies.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              The Arabic word for reading is &quot;iqraa.&quot;
                              Verse 96:1 of the Quran begins with this word.
                              English rendering of the verse reads: &quot;Read
                              (or proclaim) in the name of thy Lord and
                              Cherisher, who created-<br>
                              <br>
                              The word &quot;igraa&quot; was used in the verse
                              with a specific purpose: Angel Gabriel wanted
                              Muhammad to read what God had wanted him to read
                              in the cave of Hira. This word was not used in the
                              sense Dr. Mahathir has understood it to represent.
                              How could God have asked Muslims to acquire
                              knowledge when he wants all of them to
                              &quot;believe in the Unseen&quot;? (Quran; 2:3).<br>
                              <br>
                              Has one blind man ever been able to lead another
                              blind to his destination?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir has mentioned an interesting matter
                              in his observation, and it is true. Prior to the
                              invention of Islam, the Pagans, Jews and the
                              Christian Greeks and other scholars had studied
                              many subjects and committed their findings to
                              writing. Muslims, during their heydays, studied
                              them and added their own thoughts to the
                              already-existing corpus they had the opportunity
                              to lay their hands on. In other words, what
                              Muslims had learned in those bygone days were not
                              from the Quran or from other so-called Islamic
                              sources, rather the literary or philosophical
                              achievements they pride themselves in today came
                              to them from a body of knowledge that the infidels
                              and the non-believers had collected long time
                              before the birth of Islam.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir stressed: &quot;The early Muslims
                              produced great mathematicians and scientists,
                              scholars, physicians and astronomers etc. and they
                              excelled in all the fields of knowledge of their
                              times, besides studying and practising their own
                              religion of Islam. As a result the Muslims were
                              able to develop and extract wealth from their
                              lands and through their world trade, able to
                              strengthen their defences, protect their people
                              and give them the Islamic way of life, Addin, as
                              prescribed by Islam.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              When Muslims were able, in Dr. Mahathir's words,
                              to &quot;produce great mathematicians and
                              scientists, scholars, physicians and astronomers
                              etc. and they excelled in all the fields of
                              knowledge of their times,&quot; in the past, what
                              has stopped them from producing them in our modern
                              times? Is their inertia due to their exploitation
                              by the Hindus, Jews and the Christians? Had not
                              the Jews pursued their intellectual inclinations
                              while still living under the yoke of Germany's
                              Hitler? What have the Muslims extracted from their
                              lands? Do the gas and oil explorers and the mining
                              industries owe their gratitude to the Muslim
                              scientists? Are our present medical sciences and
                              the explorations of the outer space dependent on
                              the findings of the Muslim physicians and
                              astronomers of the bygone days?<br>
                              <br>
                              When Muslims were &quot;able to strengthen their
                              defense, protect their people and give them the
                              Islamic way of life,&quot; what had caused them to
                              lose their empire to their enemies? Was their
                              enemies' refusal to cave in to their crude and
                              inhuman rule responsible for their downfall?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir boasted: &quot;The Europeans had to
                              kneel at the feet of Muslim scholars in order to
                              access their own scholastic heritage.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              I applaud Dr. Mahathir for his honest confession.
                              There was a time in Muslim history when they could
                              access and study the Non-Muslims' works without
                              any difficulty. But when Muslims became powerful
                              and the ruler of the Non-Muslims, the latter had
                              to &quot;kneel at the feet of Muslim scholars in
                              order to access their (Non-Muslims') own
                              scholastic heritage.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              Does it not tell us how Muslims treated their
                              subjects in the days they ruled over them?<br>
                              <br>
                              Were Muslims fair in their dealings with the
                              Non-Muslims? Should not the Non-Muslims have
                              removed a painful and cancerous pustule from their
                              bodies?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir recalled: &quot;But halfway through
                              the building of the great Islamic civilisation
                              came new interpreters of Islam who taught that
                              acquisition of knowledge by Muslims meant only the
                              study of Islamic theology. The study of science,
                              medicine etc. was discouraged.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              Were the Jews and Christians responsible for the
                              creation of the new Muslim interpreters? Did the
                              Jews and the Christians conspire with the Muslim
                              interpreters and asked them to tell the Muslims to
                              neglect science, medicine etc., but to concentrate
                              only on the Islamic theology?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir recalled: &quot;The early successes
                              of the Ottomans were not accompanied by an
                              intellectual renaissance. Instead they became more
                              and more preoccupied with minor issues such as
                              whether tight trousers and peak caps were Islamic,
                              whether printing machines should be allowed or
                              electricity used to light mosques. The Industrial
                              Revolution was totally missed by the Muslims.<br>
                              <br>
                              I am glad Dr. Mahathir had the courage to find the
                              fault of his ancestors. But is the shedding of
                              crocodile's tears over the past deeds of his
                              ancestors going to compensate for what Muslims
                              have been missing from the Industrial Revolution?
                              Are the Jews and the Christians responsible for
                              this as well?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir pointed out: &quot;Apart from the new
                              nation-states we also accepted the western
                              democratic system. This also divided us because of
                              the political parties and groups that we form,
                              some of which claim Islam for themselves, reject
                              the Islam of other parties and refuse to accept
                              the results of the practice of democracy if they
                              fail to gain power for themselves. They resort to
                              violence, thus destabilising and weakening Muslim
                              countries.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              Are the above attitudes among the Muslims also due
                              to Jewish manipulations? If not, can anyone
                              explain why Muslims conduct themselves in the
                              above manners?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir agonized: &quot;The Europeans could
                              do what they liked with Muslim territories. It is
                              not surprising that they should excise Muslim land
                              to create the state of Israel to solve their
                              Jewish problem. Divided, the Muslims could do
                              nothing effective to stop the Balfour and Zionist
                              transgression.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              Before the Muslims took over Palestine, it
                              belonged to the Jews. They had been living there
                              from time immemorial. The Europeans and the
                              Americans helped them to return to their own land
                              and to establish a State of their own. Recovering
                              one's own lost possessions from a usurper has
                              never been a crime, it would never be. Therefore,
                              to accuse the Europeans with excising the Muslim
                              land to create the state of Israel is nothing but
                              an effort on Dr. Mahathir's part to white wash the
                              acts and deeds of the Arabian Muslims. I strongly
                              condemn the Malaysian Prime Minister for
                              distorting historical facts.<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir stated rather sarcastically:
                              &quot;Some would have us believe that, despite all
                              these, our life is better than that of our
                              detractors. Some believe that poverty is Islamic,
                              sufferings and being oppressed are Islamic. This
                              world is not for us. Ours are the joys of heaven
                              in the afterlife. All that we have to do is to
                              perform certain rituals, wear certain garments and
                              put up a certain appearance. Our weakness, our
                              backwardness and our inability to help our
                              brothers and sisters who are being oppressed are
                              part of the Will of Allah, the sufferings that we
                              must endure before enjoying heaven in the
                              hereafter. We must accept this fate that befalls
                              us. We need not do anything. We can do nothing
                              against the Will of Allah.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              Why some? Don't almost all Muslims believe in what
                              Dr. Mahathir has stated above? Don't most Muslims
                              draw the above conclusions from the contents of
                              the Quran? Is believing in the Quran a wrong
                              practice? If it is so, then why the learned Muslim
                              leader has not proposed abandonment of the Quran?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir has pointed out: &quot;Allah has said
                              in Surah Ar-Ra'd verse 11 that He will not change
                              the fate of a community until the community has
                              tried to change its fate itself.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              God has also said that no human being can do
                              anything without his permission. To emphasize the
                              extent of his control over the acts and deeds of
                              the humans, he asserted that &quot;not a leaf doth
                              fall but with his knowledge&quot; (Quran; 6:59).
                              When God is so pervasive over the acts and deeds
                              of mankind, how can a community of them change
                              their fate without being wanted by him? How can
                              humans defy God's enormous power?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir boasted: We are now 1.3 billion
                              strong. We have the biggest oil reserve in the
                              world. We have great wealth. We are not as
                              ignorant as the Jahilliah who embraced Islam. We
                              are familiar with the workings of the world's
                              economy and finances. We control 57 out of the 180
                              countries in the world. Our votes can make or
                              break international organisations.<br>
                              <br>
                              It is true that Muslims have the biggest oil
                              reserve and also that they have great wealth. But
                              despite this fact, a vast majority of the Muslim
                              Umma lives under extreme poverty. Despite the
                              immense wealth that the Muslims possess, many
                              Muslim nations cannot survive without the help of
                              infidel Christians. Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and
                              Bangladesh are but a few Muslim countries, which
                              prepare their annual budgets on the basis of
                              commitments of help they always look forward to
                              receiving from the donors of the Christian West.<br>
                              <br>
                              If what I stated above is true, then I should ask
                              Dr. Mahathir: (1). Who are those Muslims who own
                              the biggest reserve of oil and great wealth? (2).
                              Is not Umma supposed to represent all the Muslims
                              of the world? (3). Are not all Muslims supposed to
                              have a share in the oil reserve and the wealth it
                              creates? (4). Why has not Dr. Mahathir proposed
                              that the rich Muslim States share their wealth
                              with their poor brethren?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir preached: &quot;We are enjoined by
                              our religion to prepare for the defence of the
                              ummah. Unfortunately we stress not defence but the
                              weapons of the time of the Prophet. Those weapons
                              and horses cannot help to defend us any more. We
                              need guns and rockets, bombs and warplanes, tanks
                              and warships for our defence. But because we
                              discouraged the learning of science and
                              mathematics etc. as giving no merit for the
                              akhirat, today we have no capacity to produce our
                              own weapons for our defence. We have to buy our
                              weapons from our detractors and enemies.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                              <br>
                              Does not providing economic safeguards to a nation
                              help it develop its own defense? If yes, why the
                              learned Muslim preacher has not asked the wealthy
                              participants of the Conference to let their poor
                              brothers share just a portion of what they
                              possess? Why has he not proposed that the Kingdom
                              of Saudi Arabia allocate a portion of the revenues
                              it receives from the Hajjis for alleviating the
                              sufferings of the poor Muslims? If Dr. Mahathir
                              has the good of Umma in his heart, can he explain
                              why his country imprisons and then deports those
                              poor Muslim workers who come to his country to
                              earn a living for them and for their families?<br>
                              <br>
                              Dr. Mahathir thundered: &quot;We are actually very
                              strong. 1.3 billion people cannot be simply wiped
                              out. The Europeans killed 6 million Jews out of 12
                              million. But today the Jews rule this world by
                              proxy. They get others to fight and die for
                              them.&quot;<br>
                              <br>
                              To understand the implication of the above
                              statement, one needs to pay careful attention to
                              the tone of the language and the context in which
                              Dr. Mahathir has used it.<br>
                              <br>
                              He clearly implied that though the Europeans had
                              killed six millions of the Jews, yet the surviving
                              six million of them have the ability to rule the
                              world by proxy. He, therefore, implied that since
                              Muslims are in a large number and are, therefore,
                              very strong, they should eliminate the remaining
                              Jews so that humanity can be saved from their
                              manipulative actions.<br>
                              <br>
                              The above was the part of Dr. Mahathir's speech
                              that has shaken the mind and conscience of almost
                              all the world's Non-Muslim leaders and their
                              people. Many of them, including George Bush of
                              America, protested; others simply elected to keep
                              mum for the time being. They might respond in kind
                              to his provocative exhortations in due course of
                              time.<br>
                              <br>
                              There are many other issues in Dr. Mahathir's
                              59-point speech, on which I had the intention to
                              comment. But as my write up has already become
                              long, I wish to end my rejoinder to his speech
                              with the following questions:<br>
                              <br>
                              Since Dr. Mahathir is going to relinquish the
                              charge of his office at the end of this month,
                              what has prompted him to blast the Jews, given the
                              fact that he would not be there to face the
                              reaction of the world towards his nation?<br>
                              <br>
                              Does the Muslim world need an enemy when it
                              already has one in Dr. Mahathir?<br>
                              <br>
                              -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
