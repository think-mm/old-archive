                                President of the country.” I was amused by his 
                                interrogative questions.&nbsp;</p>

                                Asked as to why the President was in Chittagong, 
                                the Biman staff told me that he was in the city 
                                to inaugurate a-one mile long road that was 
                                broaden recently to facilitate movement of

                                wondering why the President of the country had 
                                to come and inaugurate such a small road! I also 
                                wondered who was that great person who had 
                                inaugurated the elevated railroad that runs from 
                                Tokyo to Osaka (two great cities of Japan), and 
                                on which moves the “Shinkenshen,” (also known as 
                                the “bullet train”), once the world’s fastest

                                A quick reflection convinced me that what the 
                                President had done was fully justified; had he 
                                neglected to live up to the people’s 
                                expectation, he would have lost their love and 
                                adoration, and these are two most important 
                                things that no politician in Bangladesh can ever 
                                afford to lose. &nbsp;</p>

                                His action resulted out of a political culture 
                                that runs deep in the Bangladeshi society. It is 
                                because of this political culture that requires 
                                all the Ministers of the country to gather at 
                                the airport to see off or receive their 
                                President or Prime Minister every time he or she 
                                sets off on his or her domestic or international 
                                visits, forgetting the colossal loss the country 
                                suffers due to their absence from offices, and 
                                from the amount the government has to spend on 
                                their security and transportation arrangements. 
                                It is this culture following which, Bangladeshi 
                                people welcome their Head of the Government by 
                                erecting gates and arches, even though the 
                                visitor is one of them, and he or she is 
                                visiting a part of his or her own country. &nbsp;</p>

                                emergency window, but today, this seat was 
                                allotted to the President of the country. I was 
                                made to take a seat that was located just in 
                                front of the President’s seat.&nbsp;</p>

                                from her neck.&nbsp;</p>

                                The President arrived at the door of the

                                respect to him. He waved to all of us, and then 
                                walked in and took his seat.&nbsp;</p>

                                After we were airborne, I saw Gen. Zia trying to 
                                talk to the little girl. I asked the girl to 
                                unfasten her seatbelt and to go to the 
                                President. Seeing her close to him, he extended 
                                his hand, dragged her closer to him and made her 
                                seat next to him on the seat that was 
                                deliberately left vacant for his convenience.&nbsp;</p>

                                I looked back and found the President pleasantly 
                                engrossed in a delightful chat with the kid. He 
                                was all love, and it showed up from the words he 
                                was speaking to the girl. The twinkle in his 
                                eyes proved that he was a human being first, and 
                                then a General or a President.&nbsp; I was deeply 
                                impressed, and it continues to occupy my mind 
                                even to the present. It is a memory that I would 
                                remember till the last day of my life.&nbsp;</p>

                                care of my headache. She listened to me 
                                attentively and then said: Yes sir. Give me a

                                she had a glass of water and a tablet. Highly 
                                impressed, I remarked: what a beautiful flight I 
                                am having today. Thank you very much for your

                                whispered: was that not a wonderful example of a

                                said nothing in response to my comment during

                                keep any of them. He was a very good actor, too; 
                                when that little girl, Ishita, enacted a sad 
                                scene on the stage, he had his eyes turned moist 
                                and wiped them with a handkerchief. His cohorts 
                                robotically repeated after him in a fashion, the 
                                purpose of which was not to impress the audience

                                to perpetrate his rule for almost ten years. He 
                                fully used the country’s student community to 
                                further his causes, and it was this gift of his 
                                that has turned Bangladesh into a home of one of 
                                the most militant students of the world. His 
                                inspirational legacy still guides many students 
                                of the country: Give them money and they can

                                give them money they can turn you into a 
                                prominent leader of the country; give them money 
                                they can make you a winner in the election, no

                                Following the devastation caused by tornado and 
                                tidal surge to Urir Char, I was in Sandvip with 
                                three other colleagues of mine for distributing 
                                relief among its affected people on behalf of 
                                National Bank Limited. Though Sandvip had not 
                                suffered as much as did Urir Char, yet we were 
                                there to perform our humanitarian duty, as one 
                                of the Directors of the Bank was from this

                                In the second day of our “operation,” I decided 
                                to leave Sandvip, and to return to Chittagong. 
                                One of the bank officers brought the news that a 
                                BIWTC vessel was anchored in the Bay and that it 
                                was scheduled to depart for Chittagong in a 
                                couple of hours’ time. Instructing him to 
                                procure a ticket for me, I proceeded to the site 
                                where the boat was anchored.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                The site was in the occupation of a mob; they 
                                gathered there to have a glimpse of Sk. Hasina. 
                                She came to the site (ghat in local jargon), but 
                                had difficulty in boarding the vessel, as it was 
                                anchored a distance away from the shore.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                Seeing her predicament, her workers lifted her 
                                on their hands; negotiated the water; put her on 
                                a sling, which was made of tarpaulin, and then 
                                had her hoisted on the deck of the ship. I 
                                followed other passengers, climbed the monkey 
                                ladder and occupied a seat that was allocated to 
                                me in one of the ship’s few cabins.&nbsp;</p>

                                The ship heaved up her anchor, and started 
                                moving. I peeped out of the window and lo! There 
                                were two of my well known acquaintances, who 
                                were moving briskly to the cabin in which Sk. 
                                Hasina was lodged. One of these two gentlemen 
                                became an Ambassador, first, to South Korea, and 
                                then to Moscow; the other became a very powerful

                                They took me to Sk. Hasina. She was nice and 
                                warm. She wore a simple white saree, with no 
                                discernible pretensions. She asked me what I was 
                                doing for a living, and if I had any inclination 
                                for politics. I stayed with her for a few 
                                minutes, but when I was about to leave, she 
                                reminded me to call on her, if and when I 
                                happened to be in Dhaka.&nbsp;</p>

                                Minister of Bangladesh. In her new position, she 
                                lashed at her opponents with a sharp tongue; 
                                displayed a rare quality of intrigue and a

                                defeating the non-cricketing nation of Kenya. 
                                This ‘golden feat’ of the golden boys turned the 
                                whole country upside down. People celebrated the 
                                occasion in any way they deemed fit. In their 
                                fit of excitement, they sprayed a young mother 
                                with colored-water; pulled down to ground her 
                                one year-old baby (am I right with the age of 
                                the victim?) from the rickshaw she was riding 
                                on, and sprayed the baby with the holy water 
                                they were blessing all the passer-byes with. The 
                                baby eventually succumbed to the holy spirit of 
                                the holy water, and died. &nbsp;</p>

                                the whole grateful nation as to how people

                                to whom he had been talking almost in whispers. 
                                His attention diverted by our intrusion from 
                                what he had been saying to the lady, he looked 
                                towards us and after recognizing who we were, 
                                invited us to take our seats just across the 
                                lady.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                Seconds after we were seated, the lady turned 
                                her face towards us. The lady was none but Begum 
                                Khaleda Zia, the uncompromising leader of the 
                                Bengali nation. My wife and I said <i>salam</i> 
                                to her, which she acknowledged with a nod of her 
                                head, and then turned her attention to what our 
                                friend had been telling her before our 
                                intrusion. Our friend was none, but the first 
                                physician who became Bangladesh’s High 
                                Commissioner to London after BNP had come to 
                                power, following the political demise of Gen. 
                                Ershad. We sat for a while and then excused 
                                ourselves from the august gathering.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                The sight of Begum Khaleda Zia from such a close 
                                quarter refreshed in my mind the memory of 
                                Indira <i>Priyadarshani</i> Gandhi of India. I 
                                saw her most of the times in newspaper 
                                photographs in a white saree and a white blouse. 
                                She wore a pair of sandals, and almost no 
                                makeup. She looked elegant in her outfit. Her 
                                sense of dressing made her instantly 
                                identifiable; many ladies in the Indian 
                                sub-continent found themselves in line with what 
                                Indira Gandhi represented by her simple way of 
                                dressing.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                But we Bangladeshis are different from the 
                                Indians, are we not? Because our standard of 
                                living is much higher than that of the Indians, 
                                we dress in the way that we believe is necessary 
                                for exposing our affluence. We build palatial 
                                homes, even though a large number of our people 
                                do not get two square meals a day. We import and 
                                drive expensive cars, despite the fact that a 
                                large number of the people cannot afford a ride 
                                in most of the country’s public transportation 
                                systems.&nbsp;</p>

                                Opposed to us- the Bangladeshis- Indian leaders 
                                are still using the Indian made Ambassador cars, 
                                despite the fact that their country has been 
                                producing modern looking and expensive cars for 
                                a number of years. They still prefer to dress 
                                themselves up in their home-made clothes. Many 
                                female leaders wear coarse sarees and shalwar 
                                kamizes, not because they cannot afford to buy 
                                expensive varieties of them, or that they are 
                                forbidden from procuring them from across their 
                                borders, but what prevents them from indulging 
                                in apparent excesses is, perhaps, their sense of 
                                affinity with their people. Not that this 
                                perception of theirs feeds their hungry masses, 
                                but it definitely creates an image that is 
                                indisputably representative of the conditions 
                                that prevail today in most of India’s 
                                societies.&nbsp;</p>

                                Very often, we compare the untenable aspects of 
                                our lives with that of the Indians. We hold the 
                                view that since this or that thing is also

                                their own minds to work in order to find out for 
                                themselves the probable causes that had been

                                years. In my view they, instead of launching 
                                personal tirades against those who dare poke 
                                their fingers in the eyes of those who have shut

                                the truths. The sooner they do this, and help 
                                others open their eyes and minds, the better it 
                                would be for them, their future generations and
