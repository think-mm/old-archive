								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">I am highly impressed by 
								Mr. Larry Chowdhury’s forceful response, which 
								he posted on News from Bangladesh in rebuttal to 
								Mr. Jamal Hasan’s contention on the Jews’ 
								relationship with the Muslims and the latter’s 
								patronage of them in their hard time and 
								difficulties. Agreeing with all he stated in his 
								response, I felt I should add the following to 
								his stated position so that the issues he 
								discussed became clearer.&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">I begin with Mr. 
								Chowdhury’s last comment that reads as follows: 
								“If Mr. Jamal Hasan explains his sources of 
								information, then the global cyber world readers 
								will be benefited.”&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">I do not know how Mr. Hasan 
								is going to respond to Mr. Chowdhury’s demand, 
								but I am sure that any credible source of 
								information he gives is not likely to match the 
								latter’s eye-witness like account of the 
								historical events. Mr. Chowdhury’s narration of 
								the events that took place, among others, in 7<sup>th</sup> 
								and 711 A.D. revives them in the readers’ mind. 
								They can visualize from his narration what must 
								have happened in those distant centuries without 
								ever raising their eyebrows. Mr. Chowdhury is 
								highly very credible; hence there is no need for 
								him to produce his source of information for 
								others to verify its authenticity.</font><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Mr. Chowdhury stated: “Once 
								upon a time in the history of mankind, Jews and 
								Muslims worked together to achieve common goals. 
								They dominated the intellectual arena for 
								centuries.” </font>
								<span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">
								&nbsp;</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Mr. Chowdhury has missed to 
								add the following to his above remark: Seeing 
								the intellectual abilities of the Muslims, the 
								Jews joined them to sharpen their own innate 
								abilities. This partnership helped the Muslims 
								to change the social, educational and scientific 
								milieus of the countries they invaded and ruled. 
								&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Since Muslims were more 
								enlightened and civilized then the Jews, the 
								former led the latter not only in the matter of 
								civility and social reforms; they also left them 
								behind in the matter of science and inventions. 
								Unfortunately, the Jews do not admit this fact 
								today; instead they take credit for all the 
								inventions they have made so far by violating 
								the patent rights Muslims have over their 
								inventions.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Referring to Tariq 
								Berber’s conquest of Andalusia, Mr. Chowdhury 
								stated: “Eventually minority Muslims took over 
								the administrative radar from the Visigoth 
								rulers of the Spanish-Franco territories with 
								the help of the Jews. The Visigoth rulers were 
								merciless to the Jews and they were driving them 
								out of that land in addition to the killing 
								process. Muslims appeared there as a savior for 
								the Jews.”</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Mr. Chowdhury has clearly 
								established the fact that had not the Muslims 
								taken over the rule and administration of the 
								Spanish-Franco territories, their Jewish 
								population would almost surely have become 
								extinct in the hands of their Christian enemies. 
								This also proves that the Muslims had always 
								protected the Jews. They even risked their lives 
								to save them from Hitler’s concentration camps. 
								Had the Muslims not come forward to save the 
								Jews from the gallows of the Christians, there 
								would have remained not a single Jew in the 
								Christian world to come and settle down in 
								Palestine. </font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Jews 
								have forgotten their past and are now playing 
								havoc with the life and property of the Muslims. 
								But ‘ungratefulness’ is what forms the Jews’ 
								character. This they displayed in the time of 
								the Prophet Muhammad; they are displaying it 
								even today </font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">by 
								ejecting their patrons from their own land. <br>
								<br>
								&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">In connection with the 
								presence of the Jews in India, Mr. Chowdhury 
								stated: “Thus, Kerala has the highest 
								concentration of the Jews in India.”<br>
								<br>
								Despite the Hindus’ intolerance towards the 
								people of other religions, India still hosts a 
								large number of Jews on its soil. The Hindus are 
								not reported to ever have any problem with them, 
								nor are the Jews reported to have any dispute 
								with their predominantly Hindu neighbors. </font>
								</p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">But the Hindus really 
								despise the Muslims for reasons perhaps Mr. 
								Chowdhury can elaborate in his next write up. 
								The Hindus have not only been making the 
								Muslims’ lives miserable, they have also been 
								denying them those rights they granted to the 
								Jews.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">
								&nbsp;</span></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Forced by compulsions, 
								Muslims react to the Hindus’ excesses and this 
								leads to communal riots between them. Since the 
								Hindus are in majority in India, a large number 
								of Muslims have already died in their hands.
								</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Now the Muslim Umma is 
								united and is willing to protect the Indian 
								Muslims at any cost. Recognizing the changed 
								attitude of the Muslim Umma, Indian Hindus are 
								not expected to harass or kill the Muslims in 
								future. Hopefully, we are going to see a happy 
								and prosperous Muslim community in India in days 
								ahead.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Writing about the Jews’ 
								presence in Pakistan, Mr. Chowdhury stated:&nbsp; 
								“During Pakistan era several Jews lived in 
								Pakistan. One family lived in the then East 
								Pakistan …”</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">The above fact proves how 
								anti-Muslims the Jews had been all along their 
								history. Compare a large number of them living 
								in a Hindu state of India with only ‘several of 
								them’ living in Pakistan with just one family 
								having its home in its eastern wing. Does it not 
								prove that despite receiving best of treatments 
								from the Muslims, the Jews gave preference to 
								the Hindus over the Muslims?</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">The Jews had intentionally 
								refrained from settling down in Pakistan to give 
								a bad name to the Muslims. They believed that if 
								they avoided Pakistan and settled down in India, 
								the world opinion would prefer India over 
								Pakistan. How the Jews could have done this to 
								their benefactors is beyond me. I hope Mr. 
								Chowdhury would throw some light on it in 
								future. </font></p>

								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">At one stage of his 
								rebuttal, Mr. Chowdhury wrote: “Where did Mr. 
								Jamal Hasan find that the Muslims teach hatred 
								against the Jews? Where is that history?”</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">I am sure Mr. Hasan will 
								not be able to come up with any historical 
								document to meet Mr. Chowdhury’s challenge. He, 
								however, may quote some of the verses from the 
								Quran to prove his claim on Muslims’ hatred 
								towards the Jews. Some of the verses he is 
								likely to come up with may be the following:</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">“And well ye know those 
								amongst you who transgressed in the matter of 
								Sabbath: We said to them: “Be ye apes, despised 
								and rejected” (2:65). </font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">“Say: Shall I inform you of 
								(him who is) worse than this in retribution from 
								Allah? (Worse is he) whom Allah has cursed and 
								brought His wrath upon, and of whom He made apes 
								and swine, and he who served the Shaitan; these 
								are worse in place and more erring from the 
								straight path” (5:60).</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">“Wherefore for the iniquity 
								of those who are<b> </b>Jews did We disallow to 
								them the good things which had been made lawful 
								for them and for their hindering many (people) 
								from Allah's way” (4:160). </font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">“O you who believe! do not 
								take the<b> </b>Jews and the Christians for 
								friends; they are friends of each other; and 
								whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, 
								then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does 
								not guide the unjust people” (5:51).</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Mr. Hasan may also refer to 
								the struggles the Prophet of Islam had with the 
								Jews of Medina. This he might do to prove that 
								the Prophet disliked the Jews and that he 
								himself killed a number of Jews with his own 
								hand.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">Like Mr. Larry, I am not 
								going to accept all the above as facts. 
								Moreover, we cannot take the Quran literally. 
								Most of the things it says were meant for the 
								time of the Prophet. The Jews opposed the 
								Prophet; so what if he killed at least 600 of 
								them?</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">But it does not mean that 
								he did not love the Jews. The beheading of at 
								least 600 of them does not mean that the Prophet 
								had ordered them killed out of his hatred 
								towards them. In fact, he resorted to this 
								tactic to instill love in the hearts of those 
								Jews who survived. &nbsp;They recognized the 
								Prophet’s noble gesture and reciprocated it by 
								extending their support to their Muslim rulers.
								</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
								<font face="Verdana">The best homage they paid 
								to the Prophet was through their mass conversion 
								to Islam. But in later days, the Jews changed 
								their attitude towards the Muslims. This was a 
								black mark on the history of the Jews. They will 
								have to pay for their treacherous conduct if not 
								now but in future. </font></p>
