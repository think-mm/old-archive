  <p align="justify">While the educational process and training was continuing,
  Waraqa recognized the fact that he alone could not prepare Muhammad fully for
  the momentous mission he was soon to embark upon and that if he wanted to see
  his surrogate succeed, he then must seek the help of one whose erudition on
  the subjects he was imparting to his student was superior to his own.<br>
  <br>
  Waraqa knew a monk by the name of Adas; some say his name was Suhaib ibn Sinan,
  who was well versed in the desired subjects, but spoke in Hebrew. Waraqa,
  himself knowing Hebrew well, enlisted his help, and both of them began
  teaching Muhammad all that they knew about the Jewish and Christian religions.<br>
  <br>
  Perhaps, the Quran eluded to this same monk Adas or Suhaib (16:103; also see
  N. J. Dawood's The Koran, p. 195)), while refuting the pagans, who accused
  Muhammad of being taught all that he spoke of, including the details of heaven
  and hell, by a human being and not, as he claimed, by God.<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">FIRST REVELATION<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><br>
  Muhammad continued the process of his learning for a long time; some say,
  without substantiating their claim, for fifteen years. Then suddenly one night
  in the month of Ramadhan, in the year 610 A. D., when he was forty years of
  age, he declared that he received revelations from God, and that the deity
  appointed him his last Prophet and Messenger on earth.<br>
  <br>
  The age forty has a great significance for Muslims. The Quran declares that,
  upon reaching the age of forty, they should pray to God and thank him for the
  favors he has bestowed on them and their parents and also that they should do
  good works that will please him. The Quran requires Muslims to be kind to
  their parents, for the reason that their mothers bear them with much pain, and
  with much pain they bring them to the world. It also requires them to be kind
  and thankful to their parents (46:15); it does not, however, require them to
  love their parents for what they did to them before and after their birth.<br>
  <br>
  One Muslim school of thought reports that Muhammad had told his wife, Khudeija,
  that while he was in the cavern, angel Gabriel appeared before him &quot;in a
  dazzling human form&quot; (R. V. C. Bodley, op.cit. p. 56) and ordered him to
  &quot;recite in the name of thy Lord&quot; (96:1). The Quran tells the Muslims
  that all angels can fly, each of them having at least a pair of wings (35:1),
  except for Gabriel, who is said to have six hundred of them (Maulana Mufti
  Muhammad Shafi, Tafsir Ma'ariful Quran, p. 764).<br>
  Muhammad appears to have repudiated later his aforesaid statement when he said
  the following through the Quran:<br>
  <br>
  Say: Whoever is an enemy<br>
  To Gabriel - - - for he brings down<br>
  The (revelation) to thy heart<br>
  By God's will, a confirmation<br>
  Of what went before,<br>
  And guidance and glad tidings<br>
  For those who believe, - (2:97).<br>
  <br>
  This verse implies clearly that what the Quran contains are the words that
  angel Gabriel had imparted to Muhammad through his heart and also suggests
  that the angel had never appeared to him in person. Accordingly, we may
  conclude safely that the contents of the Quran are Muhammad's own words, which
  he used to describe the &quot;inspiration&quot; that the angel, at God's
  command, had put in his heart, or should we say, in his mind?<br>
  <br>
  The mode of revelation notwithstanding, Muhammad, similar of the ancient
  Hebrew prophets before him - - - who were often reluctant to utter the words
  of God - - - and protesting that he was unschooled, refused to comply with
  Gabriel's order (Karen Armstrong, A History of God, p. 137). A storied hadith
  (Muhammad's words) attributed to his youngest wife, Aisha, recounts that
  Gabriel pressed Muhammad's chest against his own three times (Martin Lings,
  op. cit. p. 43) in order to make him follow his orders. Instantly, he felt his
  understanding illumined with celestial light and he read the first five verses
  of the Sura or chapter, called Iqraa (Sura 96), written on a banner that he
  saw hanging at the edge of the nearest sky to earth. When he finished the
  perusal, the heavenly Messenger announced, &quot;Oh, Muhammad, of a verity,
  thou art the Prophet of God! and I am his angel Gabriel!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  After the incident, we are told, Muhammad was much horrified to think that he
  might have become a mere disrespectable kahin, whom people consulted, if one
  of their camels went missing. A Jinn, one of the spirits who were thought to
  haunt the deserts and who could be capricious and lead people into error,
  supposedly possessed a kahin. Poets also believed that their personal Jinn
  possessed them.<br>
  Thus Hasan ibn Thabit, a poet of Medina who later became a Muslim and
  Muhammad's personal poet-laureate, says that when he received his poetic
  vocation, his personal Jinn had appeared to him and, throwing him to the
  ground, forced the inspired words from his mouth.<br>
  <br>
  This was the only form of inspiration that was familiar to Muhammad, and the
  thought that he might have become a majnoon (Jinni-possessed) filled him with
  despair that he no longer wished to live (Karen Armstrong, op. cit. p. 137
  ff). His wife, Khudeija, reportedly talked him out of his suicidal intention.<br>
  <br>
  It was at a much later stage that God told Muhammad that he had deputed him
  not only as a prophet for men, he also had given him the responsibility to
  convert the errant Jinns (Washington Irving, op. cit. p. 71) to the righteous
  path of Islam, a task that God certified Muhammad to have fulfilled to his
  fullest satisfaction.<br>
  <br>
  The Muslim belief that Muhammad had a physical encounter with angel Gabriel is
  more of a myth than a fact. It was concocted by the later days Muslims in
  order to boost his credential as a prophet. Not only many cynical people
  disbelief it, even many Muslim scholars discount this alleged involvement of
  the angel with Muhammad as being nothing but an imaginative falsehood of some
  of the zealots of the Islamic faith.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Fazlur Rahman is one among the prominent Muslim scholars, who
  repudiates the alleged affair without any hesitation. He maintains that
  Muhammad did not encounter Gabriel in the flesh and that the contents of the
  Quran are the result of his internal mystical experience, generated in his
  heart (or mind?) by God's inspiration (4:163) &quot;in a state of vision or
  quasi-dream.&quot; Muhammad himself, Rahman continues, had characterized the
  state in which he received his revelations by saying, &quot;Then I woke
  up,&quot; implying clearly that Muhammad had received his first and all other
  subsequent revelations in dreams. In this connection, Rahman states,
  &quot;This idea of the externality of the angel and the Revelation has become
  so ingrained in the general Muslim mind that the real picture is anathema to
  it,&quot; emphasizing, at the same time, the fact that &quot;a religion cannot
  lie on purely spiritualized dogmas and {that} reification is necessary even if
  only to serve the purpose of a vessel for the spirit&quot; (Islam, p.13).<br>
  <br>
  Rahman's position differs somewhat from a hadith attributed to Hadhrat Zubair.
  Muhammad is reported to have told him that while he was in the cave of Hira,
  he heard a voice calling him by name and declaring him the prophet of God. He
  searched all around but found no one. He then looked up and saw an angel
  floating between the earth and sky (53:6-11 &amp; 81:23).<br>
  <br>
  Convulsing with extreme fear, Muhammad ran home. His wife Khudeija tended to
  him and wrapped him up in a mantle. After a while, angel Gabriel appeared at
  his home and commanded him to &quot;Arise and deliver thy warning, O thou
  wrapped up!&quot; According to this hadith, Sura or chapter Muddaththir (Sura
  74) was the first Sura that was revealed to Muhammad and not Sura Iqraa (Sura
  96), as believed by the majority of Muslims.<br>
  <br>
  Contrary to the aforesaid hadith, the majority of Muhammad's biographers
  concede that he received all of his revelations from God, either in dream or
  during seizures.<br>
  During the painful episodes of seizures, Muhammad heard balls ringing in his
  ears and pearl-sized drops of perspiration trickled from his body even during
  the winter (Martin Ling, op. cit, p. 245). When fully recovered, he narrated
  the contents of the vision.<br>
  <br>
  Those observations of Muhammad's behavior are indicative of the fact that he
  suffered from epilepsy or schizophrenia, two medical conditions that were a
  mystery to the people of his time. Dr. Gustav Weil, in a note to Muhammad der
  Prophet, discusses the question of Muhammad's being subject to attacks of
  epilepsy, a physical condition, which has generally been represented as a
  slander, concocted by his enemies, as well as by the Christian writers. His
  ailment appears, however, to have been asserted by some of the oldest Muslim
  biographers, now labeled as &quot;hired biographers&quot; by some modern
  Muslim writers (Dr. Rafiq Zakaria, Muhammad and the Quran); it having been
  established as being a genuine assertion on the authority of other writers,
  who were contemporaneous to their time.&nbsp; He would be seized, they said,
  with violent trembling followed by a kind of swoon or, more accurately,
  convulsion, during which perspiration would stream from his forehead in the
  coldest weather; he would lie with his eyes closed, foaming at the mouth, and
  bellowing like a young camel.<br>
  <br>
  Aisha, one of his wives, and Zaid, on of his disciples, are among the persons
  cited as testifying to that effect. They regarded the seizures at such times
  as being under the influence of a revelation. He is believed to have similar
  attacks, however, in Mecca before he became a prophet, and at a time when God
  was not supposed to give him any revelation.<br>
  <br>
  Unaware of Muhammad's medical condition, Khudeija feared that he must have
  been possessed by an evil Jinn's spirits, and wanted to solicit the aid of a
  conjuror to exorcise them, but Muhammad forbade her. He did not like anyone to
  see him during those paroxysms.<br>
  <br>
  The epileptic attacks did not always precede his visions. Harith ibn Hashem,
  it is narrated, once asked him in what manner he received his revelations.
  &quot;Often,&quot; Muhammad replied, &quot;the angel appears to me in a human
  form, and speaks to me. Sometimes I hear sounds like the tinkling of a bell,
  but see nothing. (Ringing in the ears is a symptom of epilepsy).<br>
  <br>
  When the invisible angel has departed, I am possessed of what he has
  revealed.&quot; Some of his revelations, he professed, reached him directly
  form God, others in dreams; for the dreams of prophets, he used to say, are
  revelations (Washington Irving, op.cit, p.43 &amp; 44).<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">THE PREACHING<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><br>
  After Muhammad came home with the news that God ordained him his prophet, it
  was his wife, Khudeija, who not only comforted him in his fear, but she also
  feigned to have believed in what he had told her - - - thereby becoming the
  first person to convert to the new faith of Islam. To accelerate the success
  of her husband's mission, she even phrased the words of the Kalima Tayyaba, by
  invoking which, a non-Muslim instantly becomes a Muslim (Khalid Latif Gauba,
  The Prophet of the Desert, p. 33). The kalima, coined by Khudeija, reads: La
  Ilaha-ill-Allah, Muhammad-ur-Rasul-Allah, meaning: There is no god but Allah
  and Muhammad is his messenger.<br>
  <br>
  Waraqa ibn Nofal, her aged cousin, also played his pre-arranged role. Using
  his scholarly authority, he declared that what his surrogate had claimed was
  not only true but he was, moreover, the same prophet whose impending arrival
  was foretold by other religious scriptures, thereby ensuring Muhammad's
  success. His support of Muhammad notwithstanding, Waraqa never accepted Islam
  and died a Christian.<br>
  <br>
  Following Khudeija, others who converted to Islam were: 1. Ali ibn Abu Taleb.
  He was a ten-old cousin of Muhammad who lived under his care and who, later
  on, married his daughter Fatima. 2. Zaid ibn Harith, a young freed slave whom
  Muhammad, for some time, had adopted as his son and came to be known as Abu
  Zaid, father of Zaid. 3. Abdullah Atik ibn Abu Kahafa, who is universally
  known as Abu Baker, &quot;the father of the virgin she-camel,&quot; a title he
  earned after he let a 50 plus year-old Muhammad marry his six year-old infant
  daughter. He was one of Muhammad's closest friends. 4. Abdu Amr, son of Awf, a
  distant kinsman of Muhammad's mother, Amina and 5. Abu Ubaydah, son of al-Jarrah,
  who belonged to the clan of Bani al-Harith.<br>
  <br>
  As Muhammad was already convinced that the early stage of his mission was
  going to be perilous, he planned to take his early steps in secrecy. He
  apprehended hostility on every side: from his immediate kindred, the
  Quraishites of the line of Hashim whose power and prosperity Muhammad
  identified not only with idolatry, but also with their greed and selfishness,
  and still more from the rival line of Abd Shams, who were ever ready to
  dispossess the Hashemites of the guardianship of Ka'aba, which generated great
  amounts of revenue for its keepers. Abu Sofian, son of Harb and a grandson of
  Omaya, as well as the great-grandson of Abd Shams, headed the later group of
  the rivals. He was an able and ambitious man; said to have great wealth and
  influence over the people of Mecca. For Muhammad, he proved, for some time, to
  be a redoubtable opponent.<br>
  <br>
  Accordingly, he began propagating his new religion slowly, and discreetly,
  insomuch that for the first three years the number of his converts did not
  exceed forty; those, for the most part, being young persons, strangers, and
  the downtrodden slaves.<br>
  <br>
  For his followers, Muhammad introduced the three daily prayers, which he
  borrowed from the old pagan rites. Fearing ridicule from the pagans to the
  manner in which he wanted his followers to perform their prayer, he held his
  prayer congregation in private, either in the house of one of the initiated,
  or in a cave near the city of Mecca. His secrecy, however, did not, for long,
  protect him from the pagans' outrage.<br>
  <br>
  The pagans discovered Muhammad's secret meetings; in one of them, a rabble
  broke out and a scuffle ensued. In it, Saad, a Muslim, wounded one of the
  pagan opponents of his faith. This, feat on his part, earned him the first
  place among all the Muslims, who shed blood in the cause of Islam. The
  discovery of his meeting place and the consequential solicitude to which he
  found himself subjected, sapped Muhammad's spirits and increased the
  perturbation of his mind. He looked worn out and haggard, with abstraction
  having overtaken his hitherto mental sharpness. His associates noticed his
  altered mien and dreaded an attack of illness; his pagan distracters
  scoffingly accused him of mental hallucination and rejected his call to
  embrace his faith.<br>
  <br>
  Abu Bakr and Uthman enjoyed strong protection from their clans. As a result of
  this, they never faced any violence from the pagans, despite the fact that
  they had become Muslim a long time ago, and accompanied Muhammad on every trip
  he made to preach his religion. Even the young Ali was neither harassed nor
  treated harshly either by the children of his age, or by the elders for having
  become a Muslim at his tender age.<br>
  <br>
  The small community of the Meccan Christians maintained a position of
  neutrality, being confident that since Muhammad was married to one of them,
  and who wielded considerable influence on him, he would not harm them, if he
  won his struggle, nor would his opponents cause them any trouble, should they
  be able to defeat him, for the reason that they were never a cause of concern
  for their overwhelmingly large neighbors. They were absolutely right. Muhammad
  never appeared to them as a threat, rather, he not only declared them to be in
  love with the Muslims (5:85), he also provided them with protection by
  declaring them Muslims (5:114).<br>
  <br>
  After brooding silently over the problem his campaign faced for some time and,
  on being prodded by Khudeija and Waraqa, Muhammad threw off all his reserves,
  and displaying greater enthusiasm, began to go about openly proclaiming his
  doctrines, and presenting himself as a prophet, sent by God to put an end to
  idolatry as well as to mitigate the rigors of the Jewish and Christian laws.
  The hills of Safa and Marwa, sanctified by the traditions of Hagar and
  Ishmael, became his preaching grounds, and the Mount of Hira his sanctuary,
  where he retired when overtaken by the pagans' tortuous interrogations, only
  to return from it, after preparing himself with new arguments and
  pronouncements, which he always tried to pass off as being &quot;revelations
  from God.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Unimpressed, the pagans continued to ridicule him for assuming an apostolic
  character. Those who had seen him as a boy about the streets of Mecca, and
  afterwards, occupied in all ordinary concerns of life, felt greatly hurt by
  his insulting remarks on their ancestral religion as well as on their
  intellect, which he considered to be inferior to that of his own. They also
  resented his insolent attitude towards those who mattered in the Meccan
  society, but whom he deemed to be his enemy.<br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, he belittled them by claiming that only he knew all that that
  existed in heaven. Additionally, to add salt to their injury, he created an
  atmosphere of enmity in Mecca, which separated a son from his parents, and a
  brother from his siblings. As if not satisfied with the extent of havoc that
  he already wrought upon their blood relationship, he was depriving them of
  their livelihood as well by creating the turmoil, which, in its own turn, was
  discouraging people from visiting Mecca, either on call of trade or on
  pilgrimage.<br>
  <br>
  Despite the fact that Muhammad had torn apart all the fabrics of their social
  and religious lives, the pagans are not known to have ever demonstrated any
  violence against his person. They never abused him, nor did they ever try to
  cause him bodily harm. One of the retaliations they occasionally subjected him
  to was their sneer. Seeing him pass them, they used to exclaim, &quot; Behold
  the grandson of Abd al Mutallib, who pretends to know what is going on in
  heaven!&quot;&nbsp; Some, who had witnessed his fits of mental excitement,
  called him insane; few others declared that he was possessed by a devil, and
  some accused him of practicing sorcery and magic. On a particular occasion,
  some pagans are reported also to have thrown on his body a bundle of dirt,
  which caused him no injury or pain. But when the pagans failed, even after
  employing the above gentle methods to prevent him from insulting their gods
  and religion, they did not turn violent against him; instead, they
  commissioned a poet to counter his moves with his poetic lampoons.<br>
  <br>
  The poet engaged by the pagans was none other than the youthful Amru ibn al-Aass.
  His mother was a prostitute (we have mentioned her earlier in our
  presentation), who practiced her profession in Mecca. She was a very beautiful
  woman, whose list of paramours included all the nobles of the city who existed
  in the tribe of Quraish. When she gave birth to Amru, all of her lovers laid
  their equal claim on the paternity of the child. As the newborn most resembled
  Aass, he received the designation of ibn al-Aass, the son of Aass.<br>
  <br>
  Nature was very kind to the child. He had all the qualities of a genius. At an
  early age, he became one of the most popular poets of Arabia People
  distinguished him for the pungency of his satirical compositions, which he
  delivered with a captivating sweetness. He was a delight for his listeners,
  who paid close attention to what he had to say in his poems.<br>
  <br>
  Pitted against Muhammad, Amru made great efforts in countering his
  proselytizing campaigns with lampoons and humorous madrigals. The captivating
  effect of his compositions, already imprinted on their minds, people not only
  circulated them widely, they also carried them to distant places. People's
  involuntary action, though, proved to be a temporary setback for Muhammad,
  but, in the end, even Amru's effusions failed to stop him from carrying out
  his proselytizing campaigns.<br>
  <br>
  Those of the pagans who had traits of neutrality in their character demanded
  of Muhammad supernatural proofs of what he asserted. His reply may be gathered
  from his words in the Quran; it being evasive to the point that he did not
  hesitate to designate the Quran as being a miracle from God. Unsatisfied, they
  demanded palpable evidence, miracles addressed to the senses, that he should
  cause the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear, the blind to see, or the dead to
  rise. Muhammad, as usual, not only avoided those demands, he also denounced
  them for the same. At the same time, he threatened them with dire consequences
  from God, if they persisted in what he considered to be their unjustified
  demands.<br>
  <br>
  Al Maalem, an Arabian writer, recorded that some of Muhammad's disciples at
  one time joined with the pagan multitude in their demand for miracles, and
  besought him to prove at once the divinity of his mission by turning the hill
  of Safa into gold. Being thus closely urged, he took to prayer; and after
  finishing it, assured his followers as well his opponents that the angel
  Gabriel had appeared to him, and informed him that should God grant his prayer
  and work the desired miracle, all those who disbelieved would be exterminated.
  In pity to the multitude, he implored God not to cause the miracle thus
  permitting the hill of Safa to remain in its pristine state. He continued to
  insist that the Quran was his miracle and that beyond it; he had no power to
  perform additional miracles to satisfy their incredulity.<br>
