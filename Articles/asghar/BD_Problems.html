                                to 4 are perennial. Even though many 
                                Bangladeshis blame Farraka Barrage in India for 
                                the causation of periodical floods in 
                                Bangladesh, but it is not the real and only 
                                cause. Bangladesh suffered two of its severest 
                                floods in 1904 and 1954, when India had not 
                                built the barrage. Since, I believe, 
                                well-informed readers know this fact well, I am 
                                not saying more on the causes of flood and their 
                                impacts on Bangladesh. Instead, I am

                                which needs to be addressed on an emergency 
                                basis.</span></p>

                                destructive a decade ago as it is today. Though 
                                there are many causes for the birth and growth

                                2004 in Dhaka by the Muslim fundamentalists 
                                should be an eye-opener for all the people of 
                                Bangladesh. As a result of the attack, people

                                livelihood are also at stake. They need to put

                                question, which I am going to address below:</span></p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Bangladesh has 
                                only two political parties, capable of forming 
                                governments, and ruling the county. They are 
                                Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist 
                                Party (BNP). Other smaller parties have no 
                                chance of coming to power any time soon, as they 
                                lack not only organizational abilities, the 
                                number of their supporters is also miniscule.</span></p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In the general 
                                elections, both the Awami League and BNP are not 
                                always expected to have landslide victories. 
                                Since Bangladesh has a parliamentary form of 
                                government, only party that has majority in the 
                                parliament can form the government. Due to this 
                                constraint, any party that has less than a 
                                majority of members in the parliament is forced 
                                to form a coalition with the smaller parties in 
                                order to become the ruling party of the country.</span></p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">

                                the present government of Bangladesh. As it did 
                                not have a majority in the parliament, it was 
                                forced to join hands with two Islamic political 
                                parties so that it could become the ruler of the 
                                country.</span></p>

                                coalitions, ‘take and give’ is the rule of the 
                                game. As BNP needed the Islamists’ support, it 
                                had to give them ministerial posts, without 
                                which they would not have helped BNP to come to 
                                power.</span></p>

                                <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">After the 
                                Islamists got their ministerial portfolios, they 
                                became very powerful. They have not only been 
                                sheltering the miscreants of their parties, they 
                                are also inciting them to get involved in more 
                                heinous crimes, with the confidence that so long 
                                as they would remain in power, the remaining 
                                elements of BNP would not be able to resist them 
                                in any way. Their attempt at reining in the 
                                Islamic miscreants would be a cause for BNP’s 
                                downfall from power.</span></p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">If both the BNP 
                                and Awami League wish to curtail or control, to 
                                some extent, the destructive activities of the 
                                Islamists in their country, they have only one 
                                way to go about it. And it is the promise not to 
                                form coalitions with the Islamic Parties ever. 
                                To achieve this objective, both the political 
                                parties can do the following:</span></p>
                                <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
                                <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Both BNP and 
                                Awami League should come to an understanding 
                                that both of them would form governments and 
                                rule the country in rotation. If in any 
                                election, BNP fails to get the majority in the 
                                parliament, in that event, Awami League would 
                                support it, without asking for any ministerial 
                                positions, to form the government. Likewise, BNP 
                                would help Awami League to form its government, 
                                when it is its turn to rule the country.</span></p>

                                they would be able to avoid formation of 
                                coalition governments. When there would be no 
                                need of coalitions, Muslim fundamentalists would 
                                have no or little chance to occupy ministerial 
                                portfolios. Without ministerial powers, 
                                Islamists would not have as much freedom as they 
                                have now to indiscriminately kill people and 
                                destroy the fabrics of the nation.</span></p>
