		Gandhi - did he really promote non-violence?</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="darkblue"><strong><br>
		</strong></font><b><font color="#008000" size="4">By <a href="index.html">
		Nalinaksha</a>&nbsp; </font></b></p>
		<p align="justify">Gandhi's Ahimsa was meant to defuse struggles by 
		masses against the imperialists. Never once did Gandhi ask the state to 
		be non-violent. All his sermons of non-violence were reserved for the 
		exploited masses when their anger tended to coalescese into movements.
		<br>
		<br>
		Once in the 1930s two platoons of Garhwal regiment were stationed in 
		Peshawar. They were asked to fire upon unarmed demonstrators. They 
		refused. They were court martialled. Gandhi SUPPORTED THE ACTION OF THE 
		BRITISH GOVT. Let us also not forget that Gandhi actively recruited for 
		British war effort during the First World War.<br>
		<br>
		Gandhi was also the first one to introduce religion in India's body 
		politic through a retrograde Khilafat movement. It is not taught in our 
		history books that Jinnah was one of the persons who advised Gandhi 
		against this. This is not to be taken as a defence for Jinnah who had 
		his own agenda and who later used the same tool that the &quot;Mahatma&quot; had 
		introduced-religion. Gandhi had a stranglehold on Congress and had the 
		least amount of regards for following democratic conventions. Netaji 
		Subhas Bose's departure from Congress was due to this stranglehold. 
		Fifty years later we stiil see that the oldest political party in India, 
		Congress, lacks inner party democracy and this was also a creation of 
		Gandhi. <br>
		<br>
		People who want more details on the aspects I have mentioned are 
		requested to read:</p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="mediumblue">1. India and the Raj - 
		Suniti Kumar Ghosh<br>
		2. The sole spokesman - Ayesha Jalal<br>
		3. Partition of India-Legend and Reality - H.N.Seervai.<br>
		</font><br>
		In particular, I would recommend&nbsp; &quot;India and the Raj&quot; by Suniti 
		Kumar Ghosh.<br>
		<br>
		The thesis of the book is that Gandhi and other higher echelons of the 
		Congress leadership (Nehru, Patel et al) were interested in getting a 
		share of power for the comprador capitalists preferrably under the 
		tutelage of the British Raj. Ghosh makes a distinction between 
		Nationalist Capitalist and Comprador Capitalist. Nationalist capitalist 
		were those fledgling industrialists who were trying to build up an 
		industrial base through indigeneous R&amp;D, while comprador capitalists 
		were the rest of the big shots of Indian industry (the list includes 
		Tata, Birla and so on), who were interested in collaborating with 
		international and British capital and derive monopoly rent as 
		gatekeepers. Ghosh analyses all of Gandhi's political movements and 
		shows how Gandhi essentially spiked all the popular resistances and how 
		all his movements were merely aimed at letting off steam and avoid 
		dangerous revolts from building up. Ghosh also shows that Gandhi's talk 
		of ahimsa was always made when people took up arms and never against the 
		use of arbitrary force by the state.&nbsp; <br>
		<br>
		The book is incredibly detailed and very tightly argued. Suniti Kumar 
		Ghosh was a Naxal and was the editor of Liberation-the Naxalite 
		mouthpiece. Everytime I have talked about this book-the visceral 
		reaction from the audience has been to dismiss the book merely because 
		Suniti Ghosh was a Naxal. The visceral reaction can be understood as 
		denial of having to confront unpalatable statements that shakes the 
		conditioning we have been subjected to since childhood. My reaction to 
		that is that a book should stand on its own merit and not on the 
		political beliefs of its authors. I found the book to be detailed and 
		very tightly argued. It has also helped me in understanding why India is 
		the way it is. <br>
		<br>
		Before reading &quot;India and the Raj&quot;, I havenot come across any history 
		book that told me about the refusal to fire by Garhwali soldiers and 
		Gandhi's strange support for the British punitive action. Nor have I 
		seen any other book, which systematically examined Gandhi's life from 
		South Africa onwards and showd the common pattern of collaboration that 
		occurred throughout. Neither have I come across any book which pointed 
		out the hypocricy of an &quot;Apostle of non-violence&quot; recruiting people for 
		&quot;His Majesty's Army&quot;.&nbsp; <br>
		<br>
		Here's a short quote from the book<br>
		<br>
		&quot;It is quite illuminating that on the same day - 30 May, 1919 - Gandhi 
		was writing to the Private Secretary to the Viceroy:&quot;It is within His 
		Excellency's knowledge that I have made no public declaration regarding 
		the events in the Punjab.....I was not prepared to condemn martial law 
		as such; I was unwilling to do anything calculated needlessly to 
		irritate local authority.&quot; [India and the Raj- Suniti Kr.Ghosh&nbsp; Vol 
		I, page 197-198]. 30th May, 1919 was the date on which Rabindranath 
		wrote his famous letter returning his knighthood in protest against the 
		Jalianwala Bagh killings.&nbsp; <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		The second volume of the book is available on the net.<br>

		http://www.maoism.org/misc/india/india_raj_v2/india_raj_2.htm</a><br>
		<br>
		The only thing that was great about Gandhi was that he was a great 
		politician who succeeded in promoting the interest of his real 
		constituents-the comprador capitalists.</p>
