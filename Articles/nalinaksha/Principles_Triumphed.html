	duty to&nbsp; murder those who disagree with their belief, to subdue and

	</font>A cynic may ask then what about creationism. Isn't this an absurd&nbsp; 
	belief? Why a secularist would vote for a president who is a&nbsp; 
	creationist? The answer is; yes creationism is absurd. But that is&nbsp; not 
	the only absurd belief. Everyone is guilty of believing in some&nbsp; 
	absurdity. Is the belief in God logical? Or is the belief in atheism&nbsp; 
	logical? Neither of these beliefs is logical. In fact <b>the moment you&nbsp; 
	believe you step into the realm of illogicality. All beliefs are&nbsp;&nbsp;

	be called facts.<p align="justify"><b>&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;</b><tt><br>

	</tt>The reason many secularists supported a religious candidate is&nbsp; 
	precisely <b>because of this. We felt that the liberals have lost the notion 
	of right and wrong. </b>That in their zest to &quot;respect opinions&nbsp;&nbsp;

	</tt>This election should not be considered as a triumph of religious&nbsp; 
	fundamentalism. It is rather a triumph of principles. It is a&nbsp; 
	rebellion against decadence and moral relativism. It is a rejection&nbsp; of 
	political correctness. It is a victory of justice and truth.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>
	We, the secularists who supported Bush, did not support him for his&nbsp;

	This is not good enough! If someone is attacking you with the&nbsp; intent 
	to kill you, you can't reach out to him. You have to defend&nbsp; yourself. 
	Kill him or you'll be killed. Muslims can't be reached.&nbsp; They are not 
	listening. They are not open to dialogues. They burn&nbsp; books written 
	critical of Islam and kill their authors. They are&nbsp; like zombies 
	programmed to kill. They are not coming to our Internet&nbsp; forums and ban 
	us if we go to theirs. (See my failed attempt to&nbsp; reach out to Muslims. 
	Try them and see if you have a better chance.)&nbsp; But they are determined 
	to kill us. Their faith is unwavering. Their&nbsp; resolve is unshaken. We 
	have no other choice but to fight back.<blockquote>
