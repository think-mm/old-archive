	<p><b>Democracy was exported to the world from one country only, which is 
	America. The modern example of export of democracy is Japan, South Korea - 
	the two finest spot of democracy in Asia - plus Germany. Whether you like it 
	or not, democracy &amp; prosperity in the modern world hasn't been possible 
	without alliance with the US.</b> There has been failures but one cannot 
	point fingers to America's sincerity to promote democracy at each and every 
	spot on the world map. They might have read some cases poorly &amp; failed. 
	America is not GOD to be able to read every case properly; not everything is 
	within America's capacity. Failure to catch people like Osama &amp; Gaddafi 
	(previously) are examples which, some arm-chair critiques think, should a 
	cinch for the US though. Neither is America well-resourced to go to every 
	corner in the world to do it. However, other countries in the West could 
	have done a better job by putting in some efforts instead of being happy 
	with the fine democracy they have within their boundary. That could have 
	reduced suffering of people around the world. </p>

		<p align="justify"><b><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">Response:
		</font></b></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">Regarding Japan, 
		Korea and Germany-here are some quotes from &quot;What Uncle Sam really Wants 
		by Noam Chomsky. The book is available online in the Chomsky archieve 
		hosted by ZNet ( <a href="http://www.zmag.org">http://www.zmag.org</a> )
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">&quot;The major thing 
		that stood in the way of this was the antifascist resistance, so we 
		suppressed it all over the world, often installing fascists and Nazi 
		collaborators in its place. Sometimes that required extreme violence, 
		but other times it was done by softer measures, like subverting 
		elections and withholding desperately needed food. (This ought to be 
		Chapter 1 in any honest history of the postwar period, but in fact it's 
		seldom even discussed.) </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">The pattern was 
		set in 1942, when President Roosevelt installed a French Admiral, Jean 
		Darlan, as Governor-General of all of French North Africa. Darlan was a 
		leading Nazi collaborator and the author of the antisemitic laws 
		promulgated by the Vichy government (the Nazis' puppet regime in 
		France). </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">But far more 
		important was the first area of Europe liberated -- southern Italy, 
		where the US, following Churchill's advice, imposed a right-wing 
		dictatorship headed by Fascist war hero Field Marshall Badoglio and the 
		King, Victor Emmanuel III, who was also a Fascist collaborator. ...
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">In Japan, 
		Washington initiated the so-called &quot;reverse course&quot; of 1947 that 
		terminated early steps towards democratization taken by General 
		MacArthur's military administration. The reverse course suppressed the 
		unions and other democratic forces and placed the country firmly in the 
		hands of corporate elements that had backed Japanese fascism -- a system 
		of state and private power that still endures. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">When US forces 
		entered Korea in 1945, they dispersed the local popular government, 
		consisting primarily of antifascists who resisted the Japanese, and 
		inaugurated a brutal repression, using Japanese fascist police and 
		Koreans who had collaborated with them during the Japanese occupation. 
		About 100,000 people were murdered in South Korea prior to what we call 
		the Korean War, including 30-40,000 killed during the suppression of a 
		peasant revolt in one small region, Cheju Island. ... One aspect of 
		suppressing the antifascist resistance was the recruitment of war 
		criminals like Klaus Barbie, an SS officer who had been the Gestapo 
		chief of Lyon, France. There he earned his nickname: the Butcher of 
		Lyon. Although he was responsible for many hideous crimes, the US Army 
		put him in charge of spying on the French. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">When Barbie was 
		finally brought back to France in 1982 to be tried as a war criminal, 
		his use as an agent was explained by Colonel (ret.) Eugene Kolb of the 
		US Army Counterintelligence Corps: Barbie's &quot;skills were badly 
		needed....His activities had been directed against the underground 
		French Communist party and the resistance,&quot; who were now targeted for 
		repression by the American liberators. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">Since the United 
		States was picking up where the Nazis had left off, it made perfect 
		sense to employ specialists in antiresistance activities. Later on, when 
		it became difficult or impossible to protect these useful folks in 
		Europe, many of them (including Barbie) were spirited off to the United 
		States or to Latin America, often with the help of the Vatican and 
		fascist priests. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font color="#0000FF" face="Verdana">There they 
		became military advisers to US-supported police states that were 
		modeled, often quite openly, on the Third Reich. They also became drug 
		dealers, weapons merchants, terrorists and educators -- teaching Latin 
		American peasants torture techniques devised by the Gestapo. Some of the 
		Nazis' students ended up in Central America, thus establishing a direct 
		link between the death camps and the death squads -- all thanks to the 
		postwar alliance between the US and the SS. &quot;</font></p>
