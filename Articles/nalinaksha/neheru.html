	<p align="justify">Allow me to present a contrary opinion about Nehru. Nehru 
	was an anglophile who just used the language of socialism to get a political 
	mileage. When Subhash Bose organized INA, Nehru said that he would meet 
	Subhash with an open sword. Yet after the war, during the trial of the INA 
	prisoners, he appeared as their counsel in order to take advantage of the 
	tremendous popular sympathies for the INA prisoners. INA prisoners were 
	however not inducted back into the army of a free India -this reveals the 
	imperialist nature of the Indian army. Worse fate had befallen the mutineers 
	of the Indian navy. Congress leaders promised that they would not be 
	punished- a promise which was soon forgotten. </p>
	<p align="justify">Perhaps the most heinous act of Nehru was to derail the 
	Cabinet mission plan-a plan that would have preserved the Federal unity of 
	the south Asian subcontinent and which would have saved us the thousands of 
	lives lost in the partition riots and would have saved millions the trauma 
	of displacement. </p>
	<p align="justify">Let me quote from Maulana Azad: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">&quot; The Muslim League Council had accepted the Cabinet 
		Mission Plan. So had the Congress Working Committee. It however needed 
		the approval of the AICC. .... A meeting of the AICC was called at 
		Bombay on 7 July, 1946.....When the AICC met I invited Jawaharlal to 
		take over as Congress President from me. Then I moved the resolution on 
		the Cabinet Mission Plan and briefly spoke about its main features....I 
		...pointed out that the Cabinet Mission Plan had accepted in all 
		essentials the Congress point of view. It guaranteed the unity of India 
		while at the same time it held out the necessary assurances to the 
		minorities...... My speech had a decisive influence on the audience. 
		When the vote was taken, the resolution was passed with an overwhelming 
		majority. Thus the seal of approval was put on the Working Committee's 
		resolution accepting the Cabinet Mission Plan. ..... </p>
		<p align="justify">Now happened one of those unfortunate events which 
		change the course of history. On 10 July, Jawaharlal held a press 
		conference in Bombay in which he made an astonishing statement. Some 
		press representatives asked him whether, with the passing of the 
		Resolution by the AICC, the Congress had accepted the plan in toto, 
		including the composition of the Interim Government. Jawaharlal in reply 
		stated that the Congress would enter the Constituent Assembly 
		'completely unfettered by agreements and free to meet all situations as 
		they arise'. Press representatives further asked if this meant that the 
		Cabinet Mission Plan could be modified. </p>
		<p align="justify">Jawaharlal replied emphatically that the Congress had 
		agreed only to participate in the Constituent Assembly and regarded 
		itself free to change or modify the Cabinet Mission Plan as it thought 
		best. </p>
		<p align="justify">The Muslim League had accepted the Cabinet Mission 
		Plan only under duress. Naturally, Mr.Jinnah was not very happy about 
		it. In his speech to the League Council, he had clearly stated that he 
		recommended acceptance only because nothing better could be 
		obtained....... </p>
		<p align="justify">...Jawaharlal's statement came to him as a bombshell. 
		He immediately issued a statement that this declaration by the Congress 
		President demanded a review of the whole situation. He accordingly asked 
		Liaqat Ali Khan to call a meeting of the League Council and issued a 
		statement to the following effect. The Muslim League Council had 
		accepted the Cabinet Mission Plan in Delhi as it was assured that the 
		Congress also had accepted the scheme and the Plan would be the basis of 
		the future constitution of India. Now that the Congress President had 
		declared that the Congress could change the scheme through its majority 
		in the Constituent Assembly, this would mean that the minorities would 
		be placed at the mercy of the majority..... </p>
		<p align="justify">The Muslim League Council met at Bombay on 27th July. 
		Mr.Jinnah in his opening speech reiterated the demand for Pakistan as 
		the only course left open to the Muslim League. After three days' 
		discussion, the Council passed a resolution rejecting the Cabinet 
		Mission Plan. It also decided to resort to direct action for the 
		achievement of Pakistan. ....Mr. Jinnah declared 16 August the Direct 
		Action Day, but he did not make it clear what the programme would be.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">....16th August was a black day in the history of 
		India. Mob violence unprecedented in the history of India plunged the 
		great city of Calcutta into an orgy of bloodshed, murder and 
		terror....Soon the whole city was in the grip of goondas of both the 
		communities. </p>
		<p align="justify">.....(At Dum Dum) I found ...a large contingent of 
		the millitary waiting in trucks. When I asked why they were not helping 
		in restoring order, they replied that their orders were to stand ready 
		but not to take any action. Throughout Calcutta, the millitar y and the 
		police were standing by but remained inactive while innocent men and 
		women were being killed. Sixteen august, 1946 was a black day not only 
		for Calcutta but for the whole of India. The turn that events had taken 
		made it almost impossible to expect a peaceful solution by agreement 
		between the Congress and the Muslim League. This was one of the greatest 
		trajedies of Indian history and I have to say with the deepest of regret 
		that a large part of the responsibility for this development rests with 
		Jawaharlal.&quot; </p>
