			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unfortunately, Ofsted gave a 
			rave review to Tony Blair's pet city academy in Gateshead, whose 
			head of science thinks the universe began after the domestication of 
			the dog. By <b>Richard Dawkins</b><br>
			<br>
			It's been a week of handling fallout from <i>The</i> <i>Root of All 
			Evil?</i>, my TV documentary about religion. Of course religion is 
			not the root of all evil. No single thing is the root of all 
			anything. The question mark was supposed to turn an indefensible 
			title into a debatable topic. Gratifyingly, title notwithstanding, 
			the e-mails, letters and telephone calls to Channel 4 have been 
			running two to one in favour. The pros mostly praise Channel 4's 
			courage in finally saying what many people have been thinking for 
			years. The antis complain that I failed to do justice to &quot;both 
			sides&quot;, and that I interviewed fundamentalist extremists rather than 
			the Archbishop of Canterbury.<br>
			<br>
			The balance is (over-) provided by Thought for the Day, Prayer for 
			the Day, <i>Songs of Praise</i>, the <i>Daily Service</i>, <i>Faith 
			to Faith</i>, <i>Choral Evensong</i>, <i>Sunday Half-Hour</i>, <i>
			The Story of God</i>, <i>Belief</i>, <i>Beyond Belief</i>, and 
			others. Mine was a brief opportunity to put the other side. As for 
			my &quot;extremist&quot; interviews, would that Pastor Ted Haggard were 
			extreme. In neo-con America, he is mainstream. President of the 30 
			million-strong National Association of Evangelicals, he has a weekly 
			phone conversation with Bush. My other &quot;extremist&quot;, Yousef al-Khattab 
			(Joseph Cohen) of Jerusalem, was supposed, as an American Jew turned 
			Israeli settler turned Muslim, to see both sides and give a balanced 
			perspective. Wrong!<br>
			<br>
			We did invite the Archbishop of Canterbury - and the Chief Rabbi and 
			the Archbishop of Westminster - to be interviewed. All declined, no 
			doubt for good reasons. Happily, the Bishop of Oxford accepted, and 
			he was as delightful as ever. But you can't judge by example. We 
			don't judge Christians by Hitler's claim to be one, and it is 
			equally irrelevant that many Christians, like many atheists, are 
			nice people. The point is that faith, even moderate faith, is 
			pernicious because it teaches that believing something without 
			evidence is a virtue. Moderates, as Sam Harris shows in his 
			devastating book, <i>The End of Faith</i>, &quot;provide the context in 
			which scriptural literalism and religious violence can never be 
			adequately opposed&quot;. Or, in Voltaire's words, &quot;Those who can make 
			you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities&quot;.<br>
			<br>
			One of my TV locations was a London school that follows the 
			(American) Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) syllabus. The day 
			after watching my show, three colleagues told me they had 
			interviewed, for a place at university, a young woman who had been 
			taught (not at the same school) using ACE. She turned out to be the 
			worst candidate they had ever encountered. She had no idea that 
			thinking was even an option: her job was either to know or guess the 
			&quot;right&quot; answer. Worse, she had no clue how bad she was, having 
			always scored at least 95 per cent in exams - the National Christian 
			Schools Certificate (NCSC). Should my colleagues write to Ofsted 
			about ACE and NCSC? Unfortunately, Ofsted is the organisation that 
			gave a rave review to Tony Blair's pet city academy in Gateshead: a 
			Christian school whose head of science thinks the entire universe 
			began after the domestication of the dog.<br>
			<br>
			My wife wakes me up laughing in her sleep. She dreamed she met one 
			of those unidentifiable male royals and asked him what he was doing. 
			&quot;Oh, just wondering in a chinless sort of way,&quot; was the reply her 
			subconscious served up. What on earth is the point of the royal 
			family? For the Queen, the answer is clear. Given our bizarre 
			hereditary system of succession, her duty is to go on living for a 
			very long time indeed. She is, we are told, &quot;doing a fine job under 
			difficult circumstances&quot;. All the more reason to plan constitutional 
			reform now so that, when the present queen's reign ends, the 
			monarchy itself can quit while it's ahead.<br>
			<br>
			The Pluto mission reopens the fatuous debate over whether it is 
			&quot;really&quot; a planet or &quot;merely&quot; a large planetesimal. Astrologers 
			aside, who cares about such distinctions? The expedition appeals to 
			me because it will take nine years to complete. Sheer distance 
			imposes the timescale, and that's an inspiring thought in itself 
			given that the nearest star is 8,000 times further. Less glamorous 
			research would benefit from equally long vision but remains 
			unsupported. Evolution, for instance, normally takes too long to 
			make an impact within a human lifespan, let alone that of the 
			average research grant. The amazing thing is how alarmingly fast 
			evolution can sometimes go, when conditions are right. Let's hope 
			bird flu won't turn out to be an example.</font><br>
