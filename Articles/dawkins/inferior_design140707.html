	</table>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And real science, in the shape of 
	his own department of biological sciences at Lehigh University, has publicly 
	disowned him, via a remarkable disclaimer on its Web site: &quot;While we respect 
	Prof. Behe's right to express his views, they are his alone and are in no 
	way endorsed by the department. It is our collective position that 
	intelligent design has no basis in science, has not been tested 
	experimentally and should not be regarded as scientific.&quot; As the Chicago 
	geneticist Jerry Coyne wrote recently, in a devastating review of Behe's 
	work in The New Republic, it would be hard to find a precedent. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For a while, Behe built a nice 
	little career on being a maverick. His colleagues might have disowned him, 
	but they didn't receive flattering invitations to speak all over the country 
	and to write for The New York Times. Behe's name, and not theirs, crackled 
	triumphantly around the memosphere. But things went wrong, especially at the 
	famous 2005 trial where Judge John E. Jones III immortally summed up as 
	&quot;breathtaking inanity&quot; the effort to introduce intelligent design into the 
	school curriculum in Dover, Pa. After his humiliation in court, Behe — the 
	star witness for the creationist side — might have wished to re-establish 
	his scientific credentials and start over. Unfortunately, he had dug himself 
	in too deep. He had to soldier on. &quot;The Edge of Evolution&quot; is the messy 
	result, and it doesn't make for attractive reading. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We now hear less about &quot;irreducible 
	complexity,&quot; with good reason. In &quot;Darwin's Black Box,&quot; Behe simply asserted 
	without justification that particular biological structures (like the 
	bacterial flagellum, the tiny propeller by which bacteria swim) needed all 
	their parts to be in place before they would work, and therefore could not 
	have evolved incrementally. This style of argument remains as unconvincing 
	as when Darwin himself anticipated it. It commits the logical error of 
	arguing by default. Two rival theories, A and B, are set up. Theory A 
	explains loads of facts and is supported by mountains of evidence. Theory B 
	has no supporting evidence, nor is any attempt made to find any. Now a 
	single little fact is discovered, which A allegedly can't explain. Without 
	even asking whether B can explain it, the default conclusion is fallaciously 
	drawn: B must be correct. Incidentally, further research usually reveals 
	that A can explain the phenomenon after all: thus the biologist Kenneth R. 
	Miller (a believing Christian who testified for the other side in the Dover 
	trial) beautifully showed how the bacterial flagellar motor could evolve via 
	known functional intermediates. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Behe correctly dissects the 
	Darwinian theory into three parts: descent with modification, natural 
	selection and mutation. Descent with modification gives him no problems, nor 
	does natural selection. They are &quot;trivial&quot; and &quot;modest&quot; notions, 
	respectively. Do his creationist fans know that Behe accepts as &quot;trivial&quot; 
	the fact that we are African apes, cousins of monkeys, descended from fish?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The crucial passage in &quot;The Edge of 
	Evolution&quot; is this: &quot;By far the most critical aspect of Darwin's 
	multifaceted theory is the role of random mutation. Almost all of what is 
	novel and important in Darwinian thought is concentrated in this third 
	concept.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What a bizarre thing to say! Leave 
	aside the history: unacquainted with genetics, Darwin set no store by 
	randomness. New variants might arise at random, or they might be acquired 
	characteristics induced by food, for all Darwin knew. Far more important for 
	Darwin was the nonrandom process whereby some survived but others perished. 
	Natural selection is arguably the most momentous idea ever to occur to a 
	human mind, because it — alone as far as we know — explains the elegant 
	illusion of design that pervades the living kingdoms and explains, in 
	passing, us. Whatever else it is, natural selection is not a &quot;modest&quot; idea, 
	nor is descent with modification. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But let's follow Behe down his 
	solitary garden path and see where his overrating of random mutation leads 
	him. He thinks there are not enough mutations to allow the full range of 
	evolution we observe. There is an &quot;edge,&quot; beyond which God must step in to 
	help. Selection of random mutation may explain the malarial parasite's 
	resistance to chloroquine, but only because such micro-organisms have huge 
	populations and short life cycles. A fortiori, for Behe, evolution of large, 
	complex creatures with smaller populations and longer generations will fail, 
	starved of mutational raw materials. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If mutation, rather than selection, 
	really limited evolutionary change, this should be true for artificial no 
	less than natural selection. Domestic breeding relies upon exactly the same 
	pool of mutational variation as natural selection. Now, if you sought an 
	experimental test of Behe's theory, what would you do? You'd take a wild 
	species, say a wolf that hunts caribou by long pursuit, and apply selection 
	experimentally to see if you could breed, say, a dogged little wolf that 
	chivies rabbits underground: let's call it a Jack Russell terrier. Or how 
	about an adorable, fluffy pet wolf called, for the sake of argument, a 
	Pekingese? Or a heavyset, thick-coated wolf, strong enough to carry a cask 
	of brandy, that thrives in Alpine passes and might be named after one of 
	them, the St. Bernard? Behe has to predict that you'd wait till hell freezes 
	over, but the necessary mutations would not be forthcoming. Your wolves 
	would stubbornly remain unchanged. Dogs are a mathematical impossibility.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Don't evade the point by protesting 
	that dog breeding is a form of intelligent design. It is (kind of), but Behe, 
	having lost the argument over irreducible complexity, is now in his 
	desperation making a completely different claim: that mutations are too rare 
	to permit significant evolutionary change anyway. From Newfies to Yorkies, 
	from Weimaraners to water spaniels, from Dalmatians to dachshunds, as I 
	incredulously close this book I seem to hear mocking barks and deep, baying 
	howls of derision from 500 breeds of dogs — every one descended from a 
	timber wolf within a time frame so short as to seem, by geological 
	standards, instantaneous. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If correct, Behe's calculations 
	would at a stroke confound generations of mathematical geneticists, who have 
	repeatedly shown that evolutionary rates are not limited by mutation. 
	Single-handedly, Behe is taking on Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright, J. B. S. 
	Haldane, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Richard Lewontin, John Maynard Smith and 
	hundreds of their talented co-workers and intellectual descendants. 
	Notwithstanding the inconvenient existence of dogs, cabbages and pouter 
	pigeons, the entire corpus of mathematical genetics, from 1930 to today, is 
	flat wrong. Michael Behe, the disowned biochemist of Lehigh University, is 
	the only one who has done his sums right. You think? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The best way to find out is for Behe 
	to submit a mathematical paper to The Journal of Theoretical Biology, say, 
	or The American Naturalist, whose editors would send it to qualified 
	referees. They might liken Behe's error to the belief that you can't win a 
	game of cards unless you have a perfect hand. But, not to second-guess the 
	referees, my point is that Behe, as is normal at the grotesquely ill-named 
	Discovery Institute (a tax-free charity, would you believe?), where he is a 
	senior fellow, has bypassed the peer-review procedure altogether, gone over 
	the heads of the scientists he once aspired to number among his peers, and 
	appealed directly to a public that — as he and his publisher know — is not 
	qualified to rumble him. </font></p>
