			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To most people through 
            history it has always seemed obvious that the teeming diversity of 
            life, the uncanny perfection with which living organisms are 
            equipped to survive and multiply, and the bewildering complexity of 
            living machinery, can only have come about through divine creation. 
            Yet repeatedly it has occurred to isolated thinkers that there might 
            be an alternative to supernatural creation. the notion of species 
            changing into other species was in the air, like so many other good 
            ideas, in ancient Greece. It went into eclipse until the 18th 
            century, when it resurfaced in the minds of such advanced thinkers 
            as Pierre de Maupertuis, Erasmus Darwin and the man who styled 
            himself the Chevalier de Lamarck. In the first half of the 19th 
            century the idea became not uncommon in intellectual circles, 
            especially geological ones, but always in a rather vague form and 
            without any clear picture of the mechanism by which change might 
            come about. It was Charles Darwin (Erasmus's grandson) who, spurred 
            into print by Alfred Russel Wallace's independent discovery of his 
            principle of natural selection, finally established the theory of 
            evolution by the publication, in 1859, of the famous book whose 
            title is usually abbreviated to the Origin of Species. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We should distinguish two 
            quite distinct parts of Darwin's contribution. He amassed an 
            overwhelming quantity of evidence for the fact that evolution has 
            occurred, and, together with Wallace (independently) he thought up 
            the only known workable theory of the reason why it leads to 
            adaptive improvement – natural selection. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some fossil evidence was 
            known to Darwin but he made more use of other evidence, less direct 
            but in many ways more convincing, for the fact that evolution had 
            taken place. the rapid alteration of animals and plants under 
            domestication was persuasive evidence both for the fact that 
            evolutionary change was possible and for the effectiveness of the 
            artificial equivalent of natural selection. Darwin was particularly 
            persuaded by the evidence from the geographical dispersion of 
            animals. the presence of local island races, for example, is easily 
            explicable by the evolution theory: the creation theory could 
            explain them only by unparsimoniously assuming numerous 'foci of 
            creation' dotted around the earth's surface. the hierarchical 
            classification into which animals and plants fall so naturally is 
            strongly suggestive of a family tree: the creation theory had to 
            make contrived and elaborate assumptions about the creator's mind 
            running along themes and variations. Darwin also used as evidence 
            for his theory the fact that some organs seen in adults and embryos 
            appear to be vestigial. According to the evolution theory such 
            organs as the tiny buried hind-limb bones of whales are remnants of 
            the walking legs of their terrestrial ancestors. In general the 
            evidence for the fact that evolution has occurred consists of an 
            enormous number of detailed observations which all make sense if we 
            assume the theory of evolution, but which can be explained by the 
            creation theory only if we assume that the creator elaborately set 
            out to deceive us. Modern molecular evidence has boosted the 
            evidence for evolution beyond Darwin's wildest dreams, and the fact 
            of evolution is now as securely attested as any in science. </font>
            </p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Turning from the fact of 
            evolution to the less secure theory of its mechanism, natural 
            selection, the mechanism that Darwin and Wallace suggested, amounts 
            to the nonrandom survival of randomly varying hereditary 
            characteristics. Other British Victorians, such as Patrick Matthew 
            and Edward Blyth, had suggested something like it before, but they 
            apparently saw it as a negative force only. Darwin and Wallace seem 
            to have been the first to realise its full potential as a positive 
            force guiding the evolution of all life in adaptive directions. Most 
            previous evolutionists, such as Darwin's grandfather Erasmus, had 
            inclined towards an alternative theory of the mechanism of 
            evolution, now usually associated with Lamarck's name. This was the 
            theory that improvements acquired during an organism's lifetime, 
            such as the growth of organs during use and their shrinkage during 
            disuse, were inherited. This theory of the inheritance of acquired 
            characteristics has emotional appeal (for example to George Bernard 
            Shaw in his Preface to Back to Methuselah) but the evidence does not 
            support it. Nor is it theoretically plausible. In Darwin's time the 
            matter was more in doubt, and Darwin himself flirted with a 
            personalised version of Lamarckism when his natural selection theory 
            ran into a difficulty. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That difficulty arose from 
            current views of the nature of heredity. In the 19th century it was 
            almost universally assumed that heredity was a blending process. On 
            this blending inheritance theory, not only are offspring 
            intermediate between their two parents in character and appearance, 
            but the hereditary factors that they pass on to their own children 
            are themselves inextricably merged. It can be shown that, if 
            heredity is of this blending type, it is almost impossible for 
            Darwinian natural selection to work because the available variation 
            is halved in every generation. Darwin knew this, and it worried him 
            enough to drive him in the direction of Lamarckism. It may also have 
            contributed to the odd fact that Darwinism suffered a temporary 
            spell of unfashionableness in the early part of the 20th century. 
            the solution to the problem which so worried Darwin lay in Gregor 
            Mendel's theory of particular inheritance, published in 1865 but 
            unfortunately unread by Darwin, or practically anyone else until 
            after Darwin's death. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mendel's research, 
            rediscovered at the turn of the century, demonstrated, what Darwin 
            himself had at one time dimly glimpsed, that heredity is 
            particulate, not blending. Whether or not offspring are bodily 
            intermediate between their two parents, they inherit, and pass on, 
            discrete hereditary particles – nowadays we call them genes. An 
            individual either definitely inherits a particular gene from a 
            particular parent or it definitely does not. Since the same can be 
            said of its parents, it follows that an individual either inherits a 
            particular gene from a particular grandparent or it does not. Every 
            one of your genes comes from a particular one of your grandparents 
            and, before that, from a particular one of your great grandparents. 
            This argument can be applied repeatedly for an indefinite number of 
            generations. Discrete single genes are shuffled independently 
            through the generations like cards in a pack, rather than being 
            mixed like the ingredients of a pudding. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This makes all the 
            difference to the mathematical plausibility of the theory of natural 
            selection. If heredity is particulate, natural selection really can 
            work. As was first realised by the British mathematician G H Hardy 
            and the German scientist W Weinberg, there is no inherent tendency 
            for genes to disappear from the gene pool. If they do disappear, it 
            will be because of bad luck, or because of natural selection – 
            because something about those genes influences the probability that 
            individuals possessing them will survive and reproduce. the modern 
            version of Darwinism, often called Neodarwinism, is based upon this 
            insight. It was worked out in the 1920s and 1930s by the population 
            geneticists R A Fisher, J B S Haldane and Sewall Wright, and later 
            consolidated into the synthesis of the 1940s known as Neodarwinism. 
            the recent revolution in molecular biology, beginning in the 1950s, 
            has reinforced and confirmed, rather than changed, the synthetic 
            theory of the 1930s and 40s. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">the modern genetic theory of 
            natural selection can be summarised as follows. the genes of a 
            population of sexually interbreeding animals or plants constitute a 
            gene pool. the genes compete in the gene pool in something like the 
            same way as the early replicating molecules competed in the primeval 
            soup. In practice genes in the gene pool spend their time either 
            sitting in individual bodies which they helped to build, or 
            travelling from body to body via sperm or egg in the process of 
            sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction keeps the genes shuffled, 
            and it is in this sense that the long-term habitat of a gene is the 
            gene pool. Any given gene originates in the gene pool as a result of 
            a mutation, a random error in the gene-copying process. Once a new 
            mutation has been formed, it can spread through the gene pool by 
            means of sexual mixing. Mutation is the ultimate origin of genetic 
            variation. Sexual reproduction, and genetic recombination due to 
            crossing over see to it that genetic variation is rapidly 
            distributed and recombined in the gene pool. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Any given gene in a gene 
            pool is likely to exist in the form of several duplicate copies, 
            either all descended from the same original mutant, or descended 
            from independent parallel mutants. therefore each gene can be said 
            to have a frequency in the gene pool. Some genes, such as the albino 
            gene, are rare in the gene pool, others are common. At the genetic 
            level, evolution may be defined as the process by which 
            gene-frequencies change in gene pools. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">there are various reasons 
            why gene-frequencies might change: immigration, emigration, random 
            drift, and natural selection. Immigration, emigration, and random 
            drift are not of much interest from the point of view of adaptation, 
            although they may be quite important in practice. It is natural 
            selection which accounts for the perfection of adaptation, for the 
            complex functional organisation of life, and for such progressive 
            qualities as evolution may (controversially) exhibit. Genes in 
            bodies exert an influence on the development of those bodies. Some 
            bodies are better at surviving and reproducing than others. Good 
            bodies, i.e. bodies that are good at surviving and reproducing, will 
            tend to contribute more genes to the gene pools of the future than 
            bodies that are bad at surviving and reproducing: genes that tend to 
            make good bodies will come to predominate in gene pools. Natural 
            selection is the differential survival and differential reproductive 
            success of bodies: it is important because of its consequences for 
            the differential survival of genes in gene pools. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not all selective deaths 
            lead to evolutionary change. On the contrary, much natural selection 
            is so-called stabilising selection, removing genes from the gene 
            pool that tend to cause deviation from an already optimal form. But 
            when environmental conditions change, either through natural 
            catastrophe or through evolutionary improvement of other creatures 
            (predators, prey, parasites, and so on), selection may lead to 
            evolutionary change. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Evolution under the 
            influence of natural selection leads to adaptive improvement. 
            Evolution, whether under the influence of natural selection or not, 
            leads to divergence and diversity. From a single ultimate ancestor, 
            many hundreds of millions of separate species have, at one time or 
            another, evolved. the process whereby one species splits into two is 
            called speciation. Subsequent divergence leads to ever wider 
            separation of taxonomic units – genera, families, orders, classes, 
            etc. Even creatures as different as, say, snails and monkeys, are 
            derived from ancestors who originally diverged from a single species 
            in a speciation event. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the 1940s it has been 
            widely accepted that the first step in the origin of species is 
            normally geographical separation. A species is accidentally divided 
            into two geographically separated populations. Often there may be 
            sub-populations isolated on islands, where the word is generalised 
            to include islands of water in land (lakes), islands of vegetation 
            in deserts (oases) etc. Even trees in a meadow may be effective 
            islands to some of their small inhabitants. Geographical isolation 
            means no gene flow, no sexual contamination of each gene pool by the 
            other. Under these conditions the average gene frequencies in the 
            two gene pools can change, either because of different selection 
            pressures or because of random statistical changes in the two areas, 
            After sufficient genetic divergence while in geographical isolation, 
            the two sub-populations are no longer capable of interbreeding even 
            if later circumstances chance to re-unite them. When they can no 
            longer interbreed, speciation is said to have occurred and a new 
            species (or two) is said to have come into being. It is 
            controversial whether geographical separation is always necessarily 
            implicated in speciation. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Darwin made a distinction 
            between natural selection, which favours organs and devices for 
            survival, and sexual selection which favours competitive success in 
            gaining mates, either by direct combat with members of the same sex, 
            or by being attractive to the opposite sex (these are sometimes 
            called intrasexual selection and intersexual selection, 
            respectively, but the usage is misleading). Darwin was impressed by 
            the fact that qualities of sexual attractiveness were often the 
            reverse of qualities leading to individual survival. the gaudy and 
            cumbersome tails of birds of paradise are a notorious example. they 
            must hamper their possessors in flight, and certainly they are 
            conspicuous to predators, but Darwin realised that this could be 
            'worth it' if the tails also attractive females. A male who manages 
            to persuade a female to mate with him rather than with a rival is 
            likely to contribute his genes to future gene pools. Genes for 
            sexually attractive tails willy-nilly have an advantage that 
            compensates for their admitted disadvantages. </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">the philosopher Daniel 
            Dennett has written: &quot;Let me lay my cards on the table. If I were to 
            give an award for the single best idea anyone has ever had, I'd give 
            it to Darwin, ahead of Newton and Einstein and everyone else.&quot; 
            Comparative judgments like that are hard to make. But on one 
            criterion Darwin's contribution surely heads the field. the sheer 
            power of the idea, measured as the amount of explanatory work that 
            it does, divided by the extreme simplicity of the idea itself, 
            leaves one astonished that humanity had to wait till the mid 
            nineteenth century before one of us thought of it. </font></p>
