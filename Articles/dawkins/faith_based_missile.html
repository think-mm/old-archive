			<hr>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A guided missile corrects 
			its trajectory as it flies, homing in, say, on the heat of a jet 
			plane's exhaust. A great improvement on a simple ballistic shell, it 
			still cannot discriminate particular targets. It could not zero in 
			on a designated New York skyscraper if launched from as far away as 
			Boston. That is precisely what a modern &quot;smart missile&quot; can do. 
			Computer miniaturisation has advanced to the point where one of 
			today's smart missiles could be programmed with an image of the 
			Manhattan skyline together with instructions to home in on the North 
			Tower of the World Trade Center. Smart missiles of this 
			sophistication are possessed by the United States, as we learned in 
			the Gulf War, but they are economically beyond ordinary terrorists 
			and scientifically beyond theocratic governments. Might there be a 
			cheaper and easier alternative? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the Second World War, 
			before electronics became cheap and miniature, the psychologist B. 
			F. Skinner did some research on pigeon-guided missiles. The pigeon 
			was to sit in a tiny cockpit, having previously been trained to peck 
			keys in such a way as to keep a designated target in the centre of a 
			screen. In the missile, the target would be for real. The principle 
			worked, although it was never put into practice by the US 
			authorities. Even factoring in the costs of training them, pigeons 
			are cheaper and lighter than computers of comparable effectiveness. 
			Their feats in Skinner boxes suggest that a pigeon, after a regimen 
			of training with color slides, really could guide a missile to a 
			distinctive landmark at the southern end of Manhattan Island. </font>
			</p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pigeons may be cheap and 
			disposable as on-board guidance systems, but there's no escaping the 
			cost of the missile itself. And no such missile large enough to do 
			much damage could penetrate United States airspace without being 
			intercepted. What is needed is a missile that is not recognized for 
			what it is until too late. Something like a large civilian airliner, 
			carrying the innocuous markings of a well-known carrier and a great 
			deal of fuel. That's the easy part. But how do we smuggle on board 
			the necessary guidance system? You can hardly expect the pilots to 
			surrender the left hand seat to a pigeon or a computer. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How about using humans as 
			on-board guidance systems, instead of pigeons? Humans are at least 
			as numerous as pigeons, their brains are not significantly costlier 
			than pigeon brains, and for many tasks they are actually superior. 
			Humans have a proven track record in taking over planes by the use 
			of threats, which work because the legitimate pilots value their own 
			lives and those of their passengers. The natural assumption that the 
			hijacker ultimately values his own life too, and will act rationally 
			to preserve it, leads air crews and ground staff to make calculated 
			decisions that would not work with guidance modules lacking a sense 
			of self-preservation. If your plane is being hijacked by an armed 
			man who, though prepared to take risks, presumably wants to go on 
			living, there is room for bargaining. A rational pilot complies with 
			the hijacker's wishes, gets the plane down on the ground, has hot 
			food sent in for the passengers, and leaves the negotiations to 
			people trained to negotiate. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The problem with the human 
			guidance system is precisely this. Unlike the pigeon version, it 
			knows that a successful mission culminates in its own destruction. 
			Could we develop a biological guidance system with the compliance 
			and dispensability of a pigeon but with a man's resourcefulness and 
			ability to infiltrate plausibly? What we need, in a nutshell, is a 
			human who doesn't mind being blown up. He'd make the perfect 
			on-board guidance system. But suicide-enthusiasts are hard to find. 
			Even terminal cancer patients might lose their nerve when the crash 
			was actually looming. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Could we get some otherwise 
			normal humans and somehow persuade them that they are <i>not</i> 
			going to die as a consequence of flying a plane smack into a 
			skyscraper. If only! Nobody is that stupid, but how about this. It's 
			a long shot, but it just might work. Given that they are certainly 
			going to die, couldn't we sucker them into believing that they are 
			going to <i>come to life again afterwards</i>? Don't be daft! No, 
			listen, it might work. Offer them a fast track to a Great Oasis in 
			the Sky, cooled by everlasting fountains. Harps and wings wouldn't 
			appeal to the sort of young men we need, so tell them there's a 
			special martyr's reward of 72 virgin brides, guaranteed eager and 
			exclusive. Would they fall for it? Yes, testosterone-sodden young 
			men might go for 72 private virgins in the next world. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It's a tall story, but worth 
			a try. You'd have to get them young, though. Feed them a complete 
			and self-consistent background mythology, to make the big lie sound 
			plausible when it comes. Give them a holy book and make them learn 
			it by heart. Do you know, I really think it might work. As luck 
			would have it, we have just the thing to hand: a ready-made system 
			of mind-control which has been honed over centuries, handed down 
			through generations. Millions of people have been brought up in it. 
			It is called religion and, for reasons which one day we may 
			understand, most people fall for it (nowhere more so, incidentally, 
			though the irony passes unnoticed, than America itself). Now all we 
			need is to round up a few of these faith-heads and give them flying 
			lessons. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Facetious? Trivialising an 
			unspeakable evil? That is the exact opposite of my intention, which 
			is deadly serious and prompted by deep grief and fierce anger. I am 
			trying to call attention to the elephant in the room that everybody 
			is too politeor too devoutto notice: religion, and specifically 
			the devaluing effect that religion has on human life. I don't mean 
			devaluing the life of others (though it can do that too), but 
			devaluing one's own life. Religion teaches the dangerous nonsense 
			that death is not the end. </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If death is final, a 
			rational agent can be expected to value his life highly and be 
			reluctant to risk it. This makes the world a safer place, just as a 
			plane is safer if its hijacker wants to survive. At the other 
			extreme, if a significant number of people convince themselves, or 
			are convinced by their priests, that a martyr's death is equivalent 
			to pressing the hyperspace button and zooming through a wormhole to 
			another universe, it can make the world a very dangerous place. 
			Especially if they also believe that that other universe is a 
			paradisical escape from the tribulations of the real world. Top it 
			off with sincerely believed sexual promisesludicrous and degrading 
			to women though they areand is it any wonder that naïve and 
			frustrated young men are clamoring to be selected for suicide 
			missions? </font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is no doubt that the 
			afterlife-obsessed suicidal brain really is a weapon of immense 
			power and danger. It is comparable to a smart missile, and its 
			guidance system is in many respects superior to the most 
			sophisticated electronic brain that money can buy. Yet to a cynical 
			government, organization, or priesthood, it is very very cheap.
			</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our leaders have described 
			the recent atrocity with the customary cliché: mindless cowardice.
			<i>Mindless</i> may be a suitable word for the vandalizing of a 
			telephone booth. It is not helpful for understanding what hit New 
			York on September 11th. Those people were not mindless and they were 
			certainly not cowards. On the contrary, they had sufficiently 
			effective minds braced with an insane courage, and it would pay us 
			mightily to understand where that courage came from. It came from 
			religion. Religion is also, of course, the underlying source of the 
			divisiveness in the Middle East which motivated the use of this 
			deadly weapon in the first place. But that is another story and not 
			my concern here. My concern here is with the weapon itself. To fill 
			a world with religion, or religions of the Abrahamic kind, is like 
			littering the streets with loaded guns. Do not be surprised if they 
			are used. </font></p>
