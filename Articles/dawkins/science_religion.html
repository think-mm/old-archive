	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The 1996 Humanist of the Year asked 
	this question in a speech accepting the honor from the American Humanist 
	Association. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	It is fashionable to wax apocalyptic about the threat to humanity posed by 
	the AIDS virus, &quot;mad cow&quot; disease, and many others, but I think a case can 
	be made that faith is one of the world's great evils, comparable to the 
	smallpox virus but harder to eradicate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Faith, being belief that isn't based on evidence, is the principal vice of 
	any religion. And who, looking at Northern Ireland or the Middle East, can 
	be confident that the brain virus of faith is not exceedingly dangerous? One 
	of the stories told to the young Muslim suicide bombers is that martyrdom is 
	the quickest way to heaven — and not just heaven but a special part of 
	heaven where they will receive their special reward of 72 virgin brides. It 
	occurs to me that our best hope may be to provide a kind of &quot;spiritual arms 
	control&quot;: send in specially trained theologians to deescalate the going rate 
	in virgins. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Given the dangers of faith — and considering the accomplishments of reason 
	and observation in the activity called science — I find it ironic that, 
	whenever I lecture publicly, there always seems to be someone who comes 
	forward and says, &quot;Of course, your science is just a religion like ours. 
	Fundamentally, science just comes down to faith, doesn't it?&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Well, science is not religion and it doesn't just come down to faith. 
	Although it has many of religion's virtues, it has none of its vices. 
	Science is based upon verifiable evidence. Religious faith not only lacks 
	evidence, its independence from evidence is its pride and joy, shouted from 
	the rooftops. Why else would Christians wax critical of doubting Thomas? The 
	other apostles are held up to us as exemplars of virtue because faith was 
	enough for them. Doubting Thomas, on the other hand, required evidence. 
	Perhaps he should be the patron saint of scientists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	One reason I receive the comment about science being a religion is because I 
	believe in the fact of evolution. I even believe in it with passionate 
	conviction. To some, this may superficially look like faith. But the 
	evidence that makes me believe in evolution is not only overwhelmingly 
	strong; it is freely available to anyone who takes the trouble to read up on 
	it. Anyone can study the same evidence that I have and presumably come to 
	the same conclusion. But if you have a belief that is based solely on faith, 
	I can't examine your reasons. You can retreat behind the private wall of 
	faith where I can't reach you. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Now in practice, of course, individual scientists do sometimes slip back 
	into the vice of faith, and a few may believe so single-mindedly in a 
	favorite theory that they occasionally falsify evidence. However, the fact 
	that this sometimes happens doesn't alter the principle that, when they do 
	so, they do it with shame and not with pride. The method of science is so 
	designed that it usually finds them out in the end. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Science is actually one of the most moral, one of the most honest 
	disciplines around — because science would completely collapse if it weren't 
	for a scrupulous adherence to honesty in the reporting of evidence. (As
	<a href="../randi/index.html">James Randi</a> has pointed out, this is one 
	reason why scientists are so often fooled by paranormal tricksters and why 
	the debunking role is better played by professional conjurors; scientists 
	just don't anticipate deliberate dishonesty as well.) There are other 
	professions (no need to mention lawyers specifically) in which falsifying 
	evidence or at least twisting it is precisely what people are paid for and 
	get brownie points for doing. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Science, then, is free of the main vice of religion, which is faith. But, as 
	I pointed out, science does have some of religion's virtues. Religion may 
	aspire to provide its followers with various benefits — among them 
	explanation, consolation, and uplift. Science, too, has something to offer 
	in these areas. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Humans have a great hunger for explanation. It may be one of the main 
	reasons why humanity so universally has religion, since religions do aspire 
	to provide explanations. We come to our individual consciousness in a 
	mysterious universe and long to understand it. Most religions offer a 
	cosmology and a biology, a theory of life, a theory of origins, and reasons 
	for existence. In doing so, they demonstrate that religion is, in a sense, 
	science; it's just bad science. Don't fall for the argument that religion 
	and science operate on separate dimensions and are concerned with quite 
	separate sorts of questions. Religions have historically always attempted to 
	answer the questions that properly belong to science. Thus religions should 
	not be allowed now to retreat away from the ground upon which they have 
	traditionally attempted to fight. They do offer both a cosmology and a 
	biology; however, in both cases it is false. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Consolation is harder for science to provide. Unlike religion, science 
	cannot offer the bereaved a glorious reunion with their loved ones in the 
	hereafter. Those wronged on this earth cannot, on a scientific view, 
	anticipate a sweet comeuppance for their tormentors in a life to come. It 
	could be argued that, if the idea of an afterlife is an illusion (as I 
	believe it is), the consolation it offers is hollow. But that's not 
	necessarily so; a false belief can be just as comforting as a true one, 
	provided the believer never discovers its falsity. But if consolation comes 
	that cheap, science can weigh in with other cheap palliatives, such as 
	pain-killing drugs, whose comfort may or may not be illusory, but they do 
	work. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Uplift, however, is where science really comes into its own. All the great 
	religions have a place for awe, for ecstatic transport at the wonder and 
	beauty of creation. And it's exactly this feeling of spine-shivering, 
	breath-catching awe — almost worship — this flooding of the chest with 
	ecstatic wonder, that modern science can provide. And it does so beyond the 
	wildest dreams of saints and mystics. The fact that the supernatural has no 
	place in our explanations, in our understanding of so much about the 
	universe and life, doesn't diminish the awe. Quite the contrary. The merest 
	glance through a microscope at the brain of an ant or through a telescope at 
	a long-ago galaxy of a billion worlds is enough to render poky and parochial 
	the very psalms of praise. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Now, as I say, when it is put to me that science or some particular part of 
	science, like evolutionary theory, is just a religion like any other, I 
	usually deny it with indignation. But I've begun to wonder whether perhaps 
	that's the wrong tactic. Perhaps the right tactic is to accept the charge 
	gratefully and demand equal time for science in religious education classes. 
	And the more I think about it, the more I realize that an excellent case 
	could be made for this. So I want to talk a little bit about religious 
	education and the place that science might play in it. <br>
	I do feel very strongly about the way children are brought up. I'm not 
	entirely familiar with the way things are in the United States, and what I 
	say may have more relevance to the United Kingdom, where there is 
	state-obliged, legally-enforced religious instruction for all children. 
	That's unconstitutional in the United States, but I presume that children 
	are nevertheless given religious instruction in whatever particular religion 
	their parents deem suitable. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Which brings me to my point about mental child abuse. In a 1995 issue of the 
	Independent, one of London's leading newspapers, there was a photograph of a 
	rather sweet and touching scene. It was Christmas time, and the picture 
	showed three children dressed up as the three wise men for a nativity play. 
	The accompanying story described one child as a Muslim, one as a Hindu, and 
	one as a Christian. The supposedly sweet and touching point of the story was 
	that they were all taking part in this Nativity play. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	What is not sweet and touching is that these children were all four years 
	old. How can you possibly describe a child of four as a Muslim or a 
	Christian or a Hindu or a Jew? Would you talk about a four-year-old economic 
	monetarist? Would you talk about a four-year-old neo-isolationist or a 
	four-year-old liberal Republican? There are opinions about the cosmos and 
	the world that children, once grown, will presumably be in a position to 
	evaluate for themselves. Religion is the one field in our culture about 
	which it is absolutely accepted, without question — without even noticing 
	how bizarre it is — that parents have a total and absolute say in what their 
	children are going to be, how their children are going to be raised, what 
	opinions their children are going to have about the cosmos, about life, 
	about existence. Do you see what I mean about mental child abuse? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Looking now at the various things that religious education might be expected 
	to accomplish, one of its aims could be to encourage children to reflect 
	upon the deep questions of existence, to invite them to rise above the 
	humdrum preoccupations of ordinary life and think sub specie aeternitatis.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Science can offer a vision of life and the universe which, as I've already 
	remarked, for humbling poetic inspiration far outclasses any of the mutually 
	contradictory faiths and disappointingly recent traditions of the world's 
	religions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	For example, how could children in religious education classes fail to be 
	inspired if we could get across to them some inkling of the age of the 
	universe? Suppose that, at the moment of Christ's death, the news of it had 
	started traveling at the maximum possible speed around the universe outwards 
	from the earth. How far would the terrible tidings have traveled by now? 
	Following the theory of special relativity, the answer is that the news 
	could not, under any circumstances whatever, have reached more that 
	one-fiftieth of the way across one galaxy — not one- thousandth of the way 
	to our nearest neighboring galaxy in the 100-million-galaxy-strong universe. 
	The universe at large couldn't possibly be anything other than indifferent 
	to Christ, his birth, his passion, and his death. Even such momentous news 
	as the origin of life on Earth could have traveled only across our little 
	local cluster of galaxies. Yet so ancient was that event on our earthly 
	time-scale that, if you span its age with your open arms, the whole of human 
	history, the whole of human culture, would fall in the dust from your 
	fingertip at a single stroke of a nail file. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	The argument from design, an important part of the history of religion, 
	wouldn't be ignored in my religious education classes, needless to say. The 
	children would look at the spellbinding wonders of the living kingdoms and 
	would consider Darwinism alongside the creationist alternatives and make up 
	their own minds. I think the children would have no difficulty in making up 
	their minds the right way if presented with the evidence. What worries me is 
	not the question of equal time but that, as far as I can see, children in 
	the United Kingdom and the United States are essentially given no time with 
	evolution yet are taught creationism (whether at school, in church, or at 
	home). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	It would also be interesting to teach more than one theory of creation. The 
	dominant one in this culture happens to be the Jewish creation myth, which 
	is taken over from the Babylonian creation myth. There are, of course, lots 
	and lots of others, and perhaps they should all be given equal time (except 
	that wouldn't leave much time for studying anything else). I understand that 
	there are Hindus who believe that the world was created in a cosmic butter 
	churn and Nigerian peoples who believe that the world was created by God 
	from the excrement of ants. Surely these stories have as much right to equal 
	time as the Judeo-Christian myth of Adam and Eve. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	So much for Genesis; now let's move on to the prophets. Halley's Comet will 
	return without fail in the year 2062. Biblical or Delphic prophecies don't 
	begin to aspire to such accuracy; astrologers and Nostradamians dare not 
	commit themselves to factual prognostications but, rather, disguise their 
	charlatanry in a smokescreen of vagueness. When comets have appeared in the 
	past, they've often been taken as portents of disaster. Astrology has played 
	an important part in various religious traditions, including Hinduism. The 
	three wise men I mentioned earlier were said to have been led to the cradle 
	of Jesus by a star. We might ask the children by what physical route do they 
	imagine the alleged stellar influence on human affairs could travel. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Incidentally, there was a shocking program on the BBC radio around Christmas 
	1995 featuring an astronomer, a bishop, and a journalist who were sent off 
	on an assignment to retrace the steps of the three wise men. Well, you could 
	understand the participation of the bishop and the journalist (who happened 
	to be a religious writer), but the astronomer was a supposedly respectable 
	astronomy writer, and yet she went along with this! All along the route, she 
	talked about the portents of when Saturn and Jupiter were in the ascendant 
	up Uranus or whatever it was. She doesn't actually believe in astrology, but 
	one of the problems is that our culture has been taught to become tolerant 
	of it, vaguely amused by it — so much so that even scientific people who 
	don't believe in astrology sort of think it's a bit of harmless fun. I take 
	astrology very seriously indeed: I think it's deeply pernicious because it 
	undermines rationality, and I should like to see campaigns against it.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	When the religious education class turns to ethics, I don't think science 
	actually has a lot to say, and I would replace it with rational moral 
	philosophy. Do the children think there are absolute standards of right and 
	wrong? And if so, where do they come from? Can you make up good working 
	principles of right and wrong, like &quot;do as you would be done by&quot; and &quot;the 
	greatest good for the greatest number&quot; (whatever that is supposed to mean)? 
	It's a rewarding question, whatever your personal morality, to ask as an 
	evolutionist where morals come from; by what route has the human brain 
	gained its tendency to have ethics and morals, a feeling of right and wrong?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Should we value human life above all other life? Is there a rigid wall to be 
	built around the species Homo sapiens, or should we talk about whether there 
	are other species which are entitled to our humanistic sympathies? Should 
	we, for example, follow the right-to-life lobby, which is wholly preoccupied 
	with human life, and value the life of a human fetus with the faculties of a 
	worm over the life of a thinking and feeling chimpanzee? What is the basis 
	of this fence that we erect around Homo sapiens — even around a small piece 
	of fetal tissue? (Not a very sound evolutionary idea when you think about 
	it.) When, in our evolutionary descent from our common ancestor with 
	chimpanzees, did the fence suddenly rear itself up? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Well, moving on, then, from morals to last things, to eschatology, we know 
	from the second law of thermodynamics that all complexity, all life, all 
	laughter, all sorrow, is hell bent on leveling itself out into cold 
	nothingness in the end. They — and we — can never be more then temporary, 
	local buckings of the great universal slide into the abyss of uniformity.
	<br>
	We know that the universe is expanding and will probably expand forever, 
	although it's possible it may contract again. We know that, whatever happens 
	to the universe, the sun will engulf the earth in about 60 million centuries 
	from now. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Time itself began at a certain moment, and time may end at a certain moment 
	— or it may not. Time may come locally to an end in miniature crunches 
	called black holes. The laws of the universe seem to be true all over the 
	universe. Why is this? Might the laws change in these crunches? To be really 
	speculative, time could begin again with new laws of physics, new physical 
	constants. And it has even been suggested that there could be many 
	universes, each one isolated so completely that, for it, the others don't 
	exist. Then again, there might be a Darwinian selection among universes.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	So science could give a good account of itself in religious education. But 
	it wouldn't be enough. I believe that some familiarity with the King James 
	version of the Bible is important for anyone wanting to understand the 
	allusions that appear in English literature. Together with the Book of 
	Common Prayer, the Bible gets 58 pages in the Oxford Dictionary of 
	Quotations. Only Shakespeare has more. I do think that not having any kind 
	of biblical education is unfortunate if children want to read English 
	literature and understand the provenance of phrases like &quot;through a glass 
	darkly,&quot; &quot;all flesh is as grass,&quot; &quot;the race is not to the swift,&quot; &quot;crying in 
	the wilderness,&quot; &quot;reaping the whirlwind,&quot; &quot;amid the alien corn,&quot; &quot;Eyeless in

	I want to return now to the charge that science is just a faith. The more 
	extreme version of that charge — and one that I often encounter as both a 
	scientist and a rationalist — is an accusation of zealotry and bigotry in 
	scientists themselves as great as that found in religious people. Sometimes 
	there may be a little bit of justice in this accusation; but as zealous 
	bigots, we scientists are mere amateurs at the game. We're content to argue 
	with those who disagree with us. We don't kill them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	But I would want to deny even the lesser charge of purely verbal zealotry. 
	There is a very, very important difference between feeling strongly, even 
	passionately, about something because we have thought about and examined the 
	evidence for it on the one hand, and feeling strongly about something 
	because it has been internally revealed to us, or internally revealed to 
	somebody else in history and subsequently hallowed by tradition. There's all 
	the difference in the world between a belief that one is prepared to defend 
	by quoting evidence and logic and a belief that is supported by nothing more 
	than tradition, authority, or revelation. <br>
