							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Men are 
							supposed to mellow in their mid-60s. Richard Dawkins 
							appears to be going the other way. Never one to 
							tolerate fools at the best of times, he's become 
							noticeably less patient as the years roll by. &quot;It 
							does appear that I've become rather more grumpy,&quot; he 
							says, without appearing that bothered one way or 
							another. And despite a contented home life with his 
							third wife, the actor Lalla Ward, there's a great 
							deal to be grumpy about. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><!-- This site/section combo is not set up to show MPU's -->
							Back in 1976, as a 30-something research fellow 
							recently returned to Oxford after the obligatory 
							two-year stint in the US at the University of 
							California at Berkeley, Dawkins secured his 
							reputation with The Selfish Gene as a cutting-edge 
							thinker and a man blessed with the common touch. 
							Long before popularising science became a career 
							route for academics, Dawkins managed to advance the 
							scientific understanding of the evolutionary 
							process, while making that knowledge accessible to 
							the general reader. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There were 
							two key parts to The Selfish Gene. The first was 
							Dawkins's inversion of the process of natural 
							selection. Instead of trotting out the established 
							view that organisms use genes to self-replicate, 
							Dawkins made the revolutionary suggestion that genes 
							use organisms to propagate themselves, an idea that 
							immediately answered many of the difficult questions 
							of Darwinism, such as the apparent selflessness of 
							some animal behaviour. The second important theme 
							was the rehabilitation of memes, self-replicating 
							cultural transmissions - &quot;viruses of the mind&quot; - 
							that are passed on both vertically and horizontally 
							within families. And it is the meme, or rather one 
							particular meme, that is the prime cause of 
							Dawkins's current grumpiness. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to 
							memetic theory, memes are subject to the same 
							process of natural selection as genes. And yet one 
							meme, the religious meme, steadfastly refuses to 
							die. You can see where the religious meme sprung 
							from: when the world was an inexplicable and scary 
							place, a belief in the supernatural was both 
							comforting and socially adhesive. But as our 
							understanding of the world grew, you might have 
							expected the religious meme to give way to 
							rationalism. Yet the opposite has happened. Despite 
							overwhelming scientific evidence for the Darwinian 
							explanation of evolution, religious belief - and 
							fundamentalist religion at that - remains as 
							ingrained as ever. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religion 
							offends every bone in Dawkins's rational, atheist 
							body. &quot;You can see why people may want to believe in 
							something,&quot; he acknowledges. &quot;The idea of an 
							afterlife where you can be reunited with loved ones 
							can be immensely consoling - though not to me. But 
							to maintain such a belief in the face of all the 
							evidence to the contrary is truly bewildering.&quot; If 
							individual faith is, for Dawkins, an expression of 
							an ignorance, collective faith and organised 
							religion embody something much more pernicious. That 
							is what drove him to make two films for Channel 4, 
							the first of which was shown last night, and to 
							write his new book, The God Delusion, to be 
							published in September. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dawkins 
							describes these projects as &quot;consciousness-raising 
							exercises&quot; but the films come across as full-frontal 
							assaults. Protestantism, Catholicism, Judaism and 
							Islam all get both barrels. Powerful and 
							well-argued, they are; subtle, they ain't. Richard 
							Harries, Bishop of Oxford, gets a walk-on role as 
							the liberal voice of religion, but mostly it's the 
							fundamentalists of all faiths who fall under 
							Dawkins's scrutiny. &quot;They are profoundly wrong,&quot; he 
							says, &quot;but in some ways I have more sympathy with 
							their views than I do with the so-called more 
							liberal wings. At least the fundamentalists haven't 
							tried to dilute their message. Their faith is 
							exposed for what it is for all to see.&quot; </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>No such 
							thing</b> </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What angers 
							Dawkins most is the way religion gets such an easy 
							ride. &quot;We treat it with a politically correct 
							reverence that we don't accord to any other 
							institution,&quot; he says. &quot;Even secularists talk about 
							Jewish, Catholic and Muslim children. There's no 
							such thing. Children aren't born with a particular 
							religious gene. What they are is children of Jewish, 
							Catholic and Muslim parents. If you started to talk 
							about monetarist or Marxist children, everyone would 
							consider you abusive. Yet for religion we make an 
							exception. We are incapable of distinguishing 
							between race and religion. There is some statistical 
							correlation between the two, but they are very 
							different entities and we shouldn't allow them to be 
							confused.&quot; </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Predictably, 
							Dawkins has no time for faith schools. &quot;Segregation 
							has no place in the education system,&quot; he argues. 
							&quot;Take Northern Ireland. You could get rid of the 
							climate of hostility within a generation by getting 
							rid of segregated schooling. Separating Catholics 
							and Protestants has fomented centuries of 
							hostility.&quot; But Dawkins reserves his greatest scorn 
							for creationists. &quot;How any government could promote 
							the Vardy academies in the north-east of England is 
							absolutely beyond me. Tony Blair defends them on 
							grounds of diversity, but it should be unthinkable 
							in the 21st century to have a school whose head of 
							science believes the world is less than 10,000 years 
							old.&quot; </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Evolution 
							offers Dawkins all the explanations he needs - &quot;if 
							there are other worlds elsewhere in the universe, I 
							would conjecture they are governed by the same laws 
							of natural selection&quot; - but he does acknowledge 
							there are still large gaps in our knowledge. &quot;Of 
							course, we would love to know more about the exact 
							moment of Big Bang,&quot; he says, &quot;but interposing an 
							outside intelligence does nothing to add to that 
							knowledge, as we still know nothing about the 
							creation of that intelligence.&quot; </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
							Unfortunately for Dawkins, it is into precisely 
							these gaps that faith and superstition insinuate 
							themselves, a problem made worse for secularists 
							when scientists declare a religious affiliation. &quot;I 
							think the figures are somewhat overstated in this 
							country,&quot; he says tersely, &quot;as it's generally the 
							same three scientists making their voices heard. 
							Most scientists use the term God in the way that 
							Einstein did, as an expression of reverence for the 
							deep mysteries of the universe, a sentiment I share.
							</font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;In the US, 
							the picture is rather different. Coming out as an 
							atheist can cost an academic his or her job in some 
							parts of America, and many choose to keep quiet 
							about their atheism. In a recent survey, 40% of US 
							scientists said they believed in God; however, when 
							the sample was narrowed to those in the National 
							Academy [the US equivalent of the Royal Society] the 
							figure was down to 10%.&quot; </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He didn't 
							start out as an unbeliever. Dawkins was born into a 
							middle-class family that went to church each 
							Christmas. At school, Anglicanism, if not rammed 
							down the throat, was at least a given. &quot;I had my 
							first doubts when I was nine,&quot; he recalls, &quot;when I 
							realised there were lots of different religions and 
							they couldn't all be right. However I put my 
							misgivings on hold when I went to Oundle and got 
							confirmed. I only stopped believing when I was about 
							15.&quot; </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Opponents 
							have claimed that Dawkins offers a bleak view of 
							humanity, something he categorically denies. &quot;The 
							chances of each of us coming into existence are 
							infinitesimally small,&quot; he argues, &quot;and even though 
							we shall all die some day, we should count ourselves 
							fantastically lucky to get our decades in the sun.&quot; 
							But even he expresses regret at our long-term 
							prospects. &quot;Within 50 million years, it's highly 
							unlikely humans will still be around and it is sad 
							to think of the loss of all that knowledge and 
							music.&quot; </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Greatest 
							skill</b> </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dawkins's 
							greatest skill has been to synthesise other people's 
							material and come up with different ways of thinking 
							about problems that revolutionise future research. 
							But to write him off as an ideas man, pure and 
							simple, is to lose sight of the man. He may not do 
							any white-coat lab work these days but he can 
							number-crunch with the best of them. In person, he's 
							friendly rather than approachable, and there's a 
							hint of distance that suggests someone more at home 
							in front of a computer than with other people.
							</font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I did used 
							to be addicted to computer programming,&quot; he admits. 
							&quot;In the early days, there was no off-the-shelf 
							software and I wrote everything, from my own 
							word-processing programmes to more complex 
							programmes simulating cricket sounds that were 
							necessary for my research. However, I now view 
							programming as a vice, so I don't allow myself to do 
							it.&quot; </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This split 
							between the nerd and the populist has been evident 
							all through his career. The nerd may have been more 
							in evidence early on - not least when he was doing 
							his doctorate and ignored the advice of his Nobel 
							prize-winning supervisor, Nikolaas Tinbergen, and 
							opted for a stats fest, &quot;a classic piece of 
							Popperian science&quot;, instead of a fluffier study of 
							animal behaviour - but it's still around. Though 
							Dawkins has held the Charles Simonyi Chair in the 
							Public Understanding of Science at Oxford since 1995 
							and gets more attention than most other scientists, 
							you sense there's still a part of him that's not 
							altogether comfortable in the public gaze. </font>
							</p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems 
							self-evident that his recent work has become more 
							polemical, though he becomes strangely reticent when 
							you suggest he's now a political figure as much as a 
							scientist. &quot;I don't know about that,&quot; he says. &quot;I 
							wouldn't want to make those claims.&quot; But then he 
							adds that he wishes more scientists would stand up 
							to be counted in the public arena. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are 
							similar competing pulls elsewhere. After declaring 
							himself a recently converted anti-monarchist and 
							delivering a withering attack on Prince Charles - 
							&quot;he's clearly soft on religion, just as he is on 
							every dopey, half-baked failure to think&quot; - he pulls 
							back, saying he has nothing against Prince Charles 
							as a person and giving the thumbs up to the Queen.
							</font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even so, no 
							one's ever going to die wondering what Dawkins 
							really thinks. He may agonise over the thinking 
							process and worry about how his ideas are 
							interpreted, but the real voice always emerges in 
							the end. Perhaps it is the populariser's dilemma: 
							you get remembered for the soundbite rather than the 
							complexity. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Put on the 
							spot, Dawkins reveals he believes his lasting 
							contribution to science is his 1984 book, The 
							Extended Phenotype. Most lay people have long since 
							forgotten or never heard of the book in which he 
							argued that genes extend beyond their physical 
							organisms - think beavers' dams and birds' nests - 
							to ensure their survival. </font></p>
							<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But 
							phenotypes have to remain on hold for the time being 
							as it's religion that Dawkins has in his sights for 
							the forseeable future. And what if, by some 
							mischance, he were to find there is a God when he 
							dies? He looks at me as if I were mad. &quot;The question 
							is so preposterous that I can hardly grace it with a 
							hypothetical answer,&quot; he says finally. &quot;But, to 
							quote Bertrand Russell, I suspect I would say, 
							'There's not enough evidence, God'.&quot;</font></div>
