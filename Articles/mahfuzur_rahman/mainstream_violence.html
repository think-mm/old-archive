				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since September 11, 2001 
				it has often been argued that the Islamist militants are a 
				deviant lot and that mainstream Islam has nothing to do with the 
				violence that its critics have so unfairly attributed to it. The 
				argument is sometimes taken a step further to suggest that Islam 
				in fact condemns violence. Condemnation of terrorism by 
				‘moderate’ Muslims so far has not by any means been universal 
				and has often carried important caveats. For the present I shall 
				skirt around the latter issue, important though it is, and take 
				a brief look into the question whether ‘mainstream’ Islam is in 
				some major sense to blame for the increased violence Islamist 
				militants commit in the name of Islam. It will be seen that the 
				despite the presence of many decent individuals among Islamic 
				communities who abhor violence, the culpability of the 
				practitioners of mainstream Islam in the spread of violence is 
				real enough.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is 
				necessary first to define a ‘mainstream’ Muslim. No definition 
				here can be scientific with a capital s and I stand ready to 
				re-examine mine in the light of criticism. By a ‘mainstream’ 
				Muslim I mean someone who believes in one God, even if he, or 
				she, does not always abide by all that He has ordained. He prays 
				daily, even if not five times a day, prescribed by the holy 
				books. He normally goes to the mosque for the Friday 
				congregation. He is expected to fast during the month of 
				Ramadan. He spends for charity, even if what he spends may not 
				add up to the proportion of his wealth that he is supposed to 
				spend under the rules of zakat. He considers a once in a 
				lifetime pilgrimage to Mecca an obligation, even though he finds 
				arguments to avoid it as long as he can. He sacrifices an animal 
				on the occasion of the Eid-ul-Azha; he may not slaughter it 
				himself but is normally present at the gory event, sometimes 
				with his children too watching. He hopes for the mercy of God 
				for his indiscretions. He has a great deal of respect for 
				religious leaders and listens to their sermons as a matter of 
				piety. He accepts the Koran as the word of God, and neither 
				questions its edicts nor sees any contradiction in it. He knows 
				at least the rudiments of the Koran by heart, sometimes recites 
				them or hears them recited. If he is a non-Arab, he recites the 
				Koran, or hears the recitation, without understanding it but he 
				has little difficulty in accepting any translation offered to 
				him by traditional interpreters of the Book.</font><p align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana">There is little in him to suggest that he 
				is prone to violence and would probably shudder at the thought 
				of himself as an Islamist suicide bomber. He does not 
				participate in terrorist acts. If he did, Islamist terrorists 
				the world over would be counted in their hundreds of millions, 
				which is obviously not the case. I take issue with those who 
				claim that the terrorists are a ‘tiny minority’ among Muslims, 
				if by this it is meant that there are only a handful of 
				individuals who are engaged in acts of terrorism. The number of 
				terrorists is not longer small. Look at Iraq today and the 
				supply of extremists who would kill themselves in order to kill 
				others seems inexhaustible. But terrorism is not confined to 
				acts of violence by individual or small groups of Islamists. A 
				political regime can use a large number of people who would go 
				to great lengths to kill or maim to propagate their religious 
				ideals. The Taliban in Afghanistan marshalled hundreds of 
				thousands, perhaps millions, of fanatics around their cause. The 
				number of active members of the Taliban as a political 
				organization was itself large. Add to them their bed fellow and 
				you come up with a very large number. In Iran, since in 1979, a 
				political regime has forced its will on the people. This it has 
				been able to achieve through the use of a machinery of 
				government manned by a very large number of fanatics who 
				terrorize, brutalize and kill, aided by many who are only too 
				glad to help. The number of people in the Islamic world who 
				would use terror to achieve ‘Islamic’ objectives can no longer 
				be counted on the fingers of a human hand.</font><p align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana">Nevertheless, in the Islamic world as a 
				whole, mainstream Muslims, defined above, would vastly outnumber 
				those whom we can call Islamist terrorists. They would certainly 
				far outnumber terrorists in countries like Bangladesh where, 
				till recently, Islamist terrorism has been at bay. Even in 
				Pakistan, which has been a major source of supply of terrorists 
				to Afghanistan and elsewhere, mainstream Muslims far outnumber 
				terrorists. This is true of all Muslim majority countries, even 
				though the definition of mainstream will vary from country to 
				country. Ordinary Muslims do not go around killing people. Yet 
				mainstream Muslims bear a large share of responsibility for the 
				surge of Islamist terrorism in these countries. Terrorism and 
				violence, like just about anything else, do not grow out of thin 
				air. They need an environment to thrive. Mainstream Muslims 
				themselves supply that environment. In many cases this may be 
				unwitting; the consequences, nevertheless, are the same. It is 
				in the nature of the religious ideas and ideologies of the 
				mainstream Muslim that he rarely questions the orthodoxy. His 
				lack of will or power to ask searching questions in matters of 
				religion is perhaps the most important factor that creates an 
				environment where Islamist extremism thrives. Take, for 
				instance, the sermons he hears in the local mosque, at the 
				Friday congregations, and elsewhere. In many cases, along with 
				calls for piety, the sermons call for solidarity of the Muslim 
				ummah, as if it has been under attack all over the world. It is 
				strange that over fourteen hundred years after it was born, 
				after it long established itself as one of the major organized 
				faiths, now with a billion adherents to it, Islam is still 
				presented as a religion under threat from the infidels. Imams in 
				mosques still often end their solicitation to God with 
				Fa-ansurna ala al quaomil kaafereen -- “Help us against the 
				community of non-believers” Equally strange it is that such 
				sermons can be heard among expatriate Muslims in western 
				countries, where freedom of worship is fully guaranteed. </font>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And the mainstream 
				Muslim never thinks it proper to ask why is it necessary to call 
				for divine protection for Islam. He probably does not even ask 
				himself what the impact of the relentless anti-infidel rhetoric 
				may be on young and excitable Muslim minds. The example of Islam 
				–in- danger sermons is an important one in the present context, 
				because here is an issue where mainstream Muslims could ask 
				pertinent questions. But there are many other examples of 
				mainstream reticence. Critical inquiry is in general not 
				something that an average Muslim would go for in matters of his 
				religion.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is 
				important to examine some of the ways the critical spirit is 
				thwarted and fanaticism spread. It has of late been recognized 
				that madrasas, or religious schools, have been a potent breeding 
				ground for religious hatred and intolerance. That the Taliban in 
				Afghanistan were actually the eponymous madrasa students, mostly 
				raised in Pakistan, were too obvious an example, and an extreme 
				one too. But tens of thousands of these schools are spread 
				across the Islamic world and they certainly do not spread a 
				message of tolerance to dissent and unbelief. Yet Muslims would 
				in general do not speak against the spread of madrasa education, 
				though there has been some criticism from them in recent times. 
				It looks as if it is a matter of impiety to disparage madrasas. 
				On the other hand, the role of the mosque in the spread of 
				Islamic extremism has still to be adequately recognized by 
				mainstream Muslims. It is only after the London suicide bombings 
				of July 2005 that their role came to public attention. An often 
				repeated argument of Islamic apologists eager to dismiss any 
				Islamic connection of some of the acts of terror in recent times 
				has been that the terrorists were ‘modern educated’ and were not 
				products of madrasas. But many of them were regular mosque goers 
				and in all probability avid listners of fiery sermons from their 
				imams.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And the 
				very same mosques attended by the extremists are also the ones 
				that mainstream Muslims attend. Extremists do not have mosques 
				of their own. They share the house of God with other Muslims. 
				These Muslims do not protest fiery speeches and the prospective 
				young fanatic does not hear the protest. The passivity of 
				mainstream Muslims is not born simply of fear of retribution, 
				though such fear is all too real. An important reason why they 
				do not protest against extremist sermons in mosques is that it 
				is not in their tradition and training to ask critical questions 
				about the major precepts of Islam. They can discuss matters of 
				religion as much as they like so long as the discussion 
				strengthens their Faith itself, and are in the nature of piety 
				or devotion, but they may not ask probing questions that sounds 
				like criticism of Islam. There are, moreover, areas where the 
				world of the extremist and that of the mainstream Muslim come 
				dangerously close to each other. Many mainstream Muslims are 
				often sympathetic to causes that extremists also promote and are 
				eager to die for. There are regions of the world where Muslims 
				have suffered gross injustices at the hands of foreign powers. 
				The Middle East is an obvious example. Many extremists have 
				taken up the cause of the oppressed here and elsewhere. 
				Mainstream Muslims have also voiced protest and frustration at 
				such injustices. It is not, however, usual for them to make it 
				abundantly clear that their support of the cause of the 
				oppressed has nothing to do with religion, or that they would 
				protest with equal vigour injustices to other communities around 
				the world. If the extremist thinks in the circumstance that he 
				has the support of the mainstream Muslim, the latter is not 
				entirely without blame. Unthinking acts of shame, such as 
				jubilation among Muslims at large in many countries following 
				September 11, 2001, only strengthen the extremists’ impression 
				of support from their community that they may not have in 
				reality.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For the 
				mainstream Muslim, to be Muslim is still an overriding 
				consideration that guides his conduct, far more so in fact than 
				being a Christian is in a Christian’s life. In the zeal to be 
				Muslim, he often ignores the danger signs which should have told 
				him to stop, think and talk. Extremists exploded some 500 bombs 
				in Bangladesh in a single day in August this year. The bombs 
				killed and maimed and spread terror throughout the country. It 
				is hardly conceivable that the scores or so of the extremists 
				who planted the bombs did not pray in the same local mosque 
				where other Muslims prayed hours or days before the attacks. 
				They may even have rubbed shoulders against each other as they 
				stood in serried ranks before God the Merciful. But they never 
				talked to each other. Mainstream Muslims never asked what the 
				extremists were up to and why. They never drew the extremists 
				into a debate about their ideas, ideologies, and the reasons for 
				their rage.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Or 
				could it be that many mainstream Muslims did actually notice the 
				militants, even talked to them, and merely gave them a wink and 
				a nod? Is there a fringe of mainstream Islam that meets the 
				extremist in clandestine alliance for Islam?</font><br>
