	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">&nbsp;<font face="Verdana">The 
	mayhem being perpetrated by Islamist extremists in Bangladesh is so 
	widespread, and the threat of worse to come so real, that there is now a 
	sense of crisis in the air. And it is time too. An unconscionable degree of 
	complacency at almost all levels of society has so far prevented a hard look 
	at a phenomenon that has been years in the making. Even as of today, one 
	cannot be sure that an adequate understanding of the nature of the peril has 
	yet permeated our society. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone who has observed the rise of Islamic 
	fundamentalism in Bangladesh would be struck by the long sorry path that has 
	led us where we are today. The country’s slide towards theocracy, or 
	political Islam, is not new; it began some three decades ago. It is well 
	known that the big push came in the mid- nineteen hundred seventies when 
	political parties with overt religious agenda were allowed to operate in 
	what was the new-born secular Bangladesh.&nbsp; That was an enormous boon to an 
	already large body of fundamentalists whose&nbsp; hostility to the very creation 
	of secular Bangladesh is all too well known and whose political agenda&nbsp; it 
	was to make Bangladesh an Islamic state. &nbsp;But the momentum of the slide was 
	also maintained by a complex set of factors, not the least of which was the 
	pandering of political parties to forces of obscurantism. The history of the 
	country is replete with instances of political leaders falling over each 
	other in depicting themselves as the only ‘true’ Muslims, and hence 
	deserving of support of Muslim voters.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what has this to do with the emergence of 
	Islamist extremism? A whole lot, in fact. It is not difficult to gauge the 
	awful logic of the militants. If political Islam is the ultimate goal, they 
	may well argue, why not achieve it now rather than later, and thus hasten 
	divine pleasure? &nbsp;The emerging militant ideology elsewhere in the Islamic 
	world must have added to the urgency and external assistance in the form of 
	both money and skill must also have bolstered the militants. Nevertheless, 
	it is crucial to recognize that the wind of Islamist extremism was sown over 
	all those years when political Islam was being nurtured in the country: it 
	is now time to reap the whirlwind. It will not be easy to destroy the bitter 
	harvest.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nature of protest that we are beginning to 
	hear nowadays against Islamist militancy should make one wonder whether we 
	are yet equal to the task of defeating it. Some of the recent pronouncements 
	against suicide bombings are not much more than anodynes.&nbsp; Actually, they 
	conceal far more than they reveal.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been numerous public statements to the 
	effect that “Islam is a religion of peace” and “does not condone violence”. 
	Some of these pronouncements decried suicide bombing as “un-Islamic”, even a 
	sin. Others have claimed that this (that is, the extremists’ method) is not 
	the way to “establish Islam”.&nbsp; Some have denounced the bombers as “enemies 
	of Islam”. These assertions&nbsp; -- some or all of them -- have been made by 
	many segments of the society, the Government, the clergy, and the press 
	included. The Government reportedly put out propaganda flyers emphasizing 
	the peaceful image of Islam. These, for example, cited a Koranic verse 
	suggesting that killing an individual is like killing the whole human race. 
	Far more importantly, religious leaders have made some of these assertions. 
	Imams at Friday congregations have condemned the militants and prayers have 
	been offered for divine deliverance from the extremist menace.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The usefulness of merely proclaiming that Islam is 
	a religion of peace is highly questionable. To the public at large, its 
	value is minimal; a large majority of them are in any case peace loving 
	people who hardly need to be given a message of peace. To the militants, the 
	message is totally worthless. As far as they are concerned, they represent 
	“true” Islam, and for every verse of the Koran that the “moderates” might 
	quote to criticize them, they could offer quotes that they would say 
	vindicated them. They could also fall back, rather easily, on traditional 
	exegeses of the Koran. The usefulness of a polemical confrontation with the 
	extremists as a way of subduing them is very limited indeed, especially when 
	it remains on paper.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far more significant is the reported criticism of 
	the extremists from religious leaders that took the form: “This is not the 
	way to establish Islam”. Implicit in the statement is, of course, their 
	often declared goal of “establishing Islam”. One should have thought that 
	Islam was firmly established fourteen hundred years ago and remains one of 
	the major faiths, espoused by a billion people. The Islamic faith satisfies 
	the spiritual needs of countless millions. What do these leaders mean, then, 
	when they say that they want to establish Islam? Plainly it is political 
	Islam that they want to establish. In other words, their goal and that of 
	the Islamist militants are one and the same.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us quickly remind ourselves that it is the 
	relentless progression of the ideology of political Islam in Bangladesh over 
	the past three decades that has nurtured extremist ideologies we are 
	supposed to be fighting against. Now we are being told to continue on that 
	very path. In other words, we have a situation where the “mainstream” 
	Islamists are denouncing the extremist Islamists only to advance their own 
	political agenda. They in effect seem to be all too willing to reap the 
	whirlwind.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This actually leads to some crucial questions 
	concerning the aim of the Islamist leaders on the one hand, and the future 
	of the country as conceived by its founding fathers and its valiant freedom 
	fighters, on the other. The militants have demanded the abolition of our 
	secular judicial system. Hence was their bombing of courts of law and 
	killing of judges. Would the mainstream Islamists abolish our judicial 
	system? The extremists have demanded a radical transformation of our 
	educational system, with even more emphasis on <i>madrasa </i>education than 
	in the past. Would this be the aim of their more peaceable counterparts? In 
	recent days the radicals have threatened the life of women who do not wear 
	the <i>hijab</i>. We may remind ourselves here that not so long ago their 
	counterparts in Algeria slit the throats of many Muslim women for not 
	dressing “modestly” in public. Would the political Islamists enforce such <i>
	purdah</i>? And would all of these, and probably much more, be done through 
	peaceful means? History comes up some uncomfortable precedents. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In modern times there have been two radical 
	attempts at establishing political Islam: in Iran and Afghanistan. The 
	revolution of 1979 in Iran established a fully fledged Islamic state. Ever 
	since its inception, it has brutally suppressed dissent and individual 
	freedom, ferociously enforced Islamic laws, and has been utterly intolerant 
	of religious minorities. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan even upstaged the 
	Iranian. Its brutality in suppressing everything that smacked of individual 
	freedom and secular culture has become a legend. Its treatment of women was 
	unimaginably vile.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Islamist leaders in Bangladesh talk about 
	“establishing Islam,” it is political Islam exemplified above that they have 
	in mind. Consider the stance of some of these leaders in defence of it. &nbsp;In 
	not so distant a past, they publicly declared their intention of turning 
	Bangladesh into a Taliban type state. This makes them indistinguishable from 
	the Islamist extremists they now seem to decry. It is worth remembering too 
	that when the Americans put the Taliban to flight in Afghanistan many <i>
	imams</i> in Bangladesh, including some who are lending their voice against 
	extremist bombers today, wanted to wage <i>jihad</i> against the Americans. 
	The reason behind the protest was of course not that a Muslim country’s 
	sovereignty was violated but that the political regime of country happened 
	to be close to the protesters’ hearts. It is also important to note that 
	none of these religious leaders of any stature has protested the many past 
	bombings of secular <i>jatra </i>stages and cinema halls and even <i>
	darghahs </i>as unacceptable acts not in conformity with Islam. On the 
	question of the place of the Ahmadiyas in society, they have either 
	prevaricated or have come down heavily against the sect.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, in fighting Islamist militancy our society 
	should not only resist those who are using terror to further their ultimate 
	goal of establishing political Islam, but must also face squarely all others 
	who share the same goals. It needs unequivocally to reject political Islam, 
	while continuing to guarantee full freedom of conscience to all individuals. 
	For the society to be doing anything less will be to deceive itself. The 
	rejection of political Islam must also be combined with a longer-term effort 
	at free and open discussion on Islam that goes well beyond piety and 
	instills a critical spirit of inquiry among mainstream Muslims in the 
	country. An open society is generally one where shadowy groups find less 
	cope for mischief. &nbsp;</font></p>
