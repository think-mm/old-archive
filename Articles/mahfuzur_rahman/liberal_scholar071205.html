	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">&nbsp;<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	&nbsp;Even though the Koran has been described, in the Book itself, as a “clear 
	record”,&nbsp; <i>kitaabin mubeen</i> (&nbsp; e.g., in XI: 6), &nbsp;which should be easy 
	to understand, many of its individual verses require a great deal of 
	interpretation. An elaborate literature of exegeses, or <i>tafsir</i>, has 
	developed over the centuries, and the process continues today. It is often 
	impossible to understand particular passages of the Book without the 
	“insights” of an exegete. It is not that all interpretations satisfy the 
	reader; in many cases interpretations vary so much that they are in conflict 
	with each other, leaving the reader&nbsp; perplexed. These exegeses can be 
	broadly divided into two classes: literalist and liberal. The modern Muslim 
	is likely to be drawn to the latter rather than the former type of 
	interpretation. Yet, in many cases, even a most liberal interpretation of a 
	passage or a sentence of the Koran can be unsatisfactory to the modern mind.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dissatisfaction increases when the liberal 
	interpretation appears to stretch the meaning. I have called such stretching 
	dissimulation. Abdullah Yusuf Ali is, I believe, among the more liberal of 
	the interpreters of the Koran. His “Holy Qur’an: translation and commentary” 
	is probably more widely read than any other similar publication in English. 
	&nbsp;There is little doubt about his scholarship that includes modern philosophy 
	and western literature. He quotes Shakespeare and Keats at will and does not 
	think it inappropriate to use the word God for Allah. (Zealots have seen to 
	it that later editions of his translation revert to Allah!). He also uses 
	simply “Muhammad” for the Prophet of Islam without the suffix “peace be upon 
	him”, a practice that has become almost an anathema to many orthodox 
	Muslims. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in many cases Ali’s translation and 
	interpretation put a gloss on particular expressions in the Koran that is 
	unacceptable at best and misleading at worst. One can sympathize with his 
	concern to be reasonable, modern, or even nice, but there are many instances 
	where his interpretation is hard to accept. &nbsp;In many cases his liberal 
	interpretation amounts to attempt at squaring the circle. There are numerous 
	instances of such dissimulation. The following paragraphs are only 
	illustrative. They demonstrate the difficulty inherent in the Book that only 
	totally blind faith can afford to ignore. They also suggest that if the 
	literalist interpretations of the Koran do often not stand to reason, 
	neither do the liberal exegeses. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The treatment of women in the Koran has been among 
	the most contentious issues in Islam today. The Book devotes a whole long <i>
	sura </i>on women ( <i>Sura Nissa</i> (IV)). But there are many passages in 
	other <i>suras</i> dealing with the subject. In IV: 34 the Koran recommends 
	that husbands beat their disobedient wives. The verse says, clearly: <i>wa 
	adhrebu hunna</i>, meaning: “beat them.” &nbsp;Yusuf Ali, a decent man that he 
	is, adds a qualifying word (“lightly”) to “beat”, making the recommendation: 
	“beat them (lightly)”. &nbsp;By that qualification, he probably wanted to show 
	the Koran in humane light, particularly in view of the many other 
	prescriptions in the Book that highlights the inferior position of women in 
	Islam. But in the process he has twisted the meaning and has served no 
	useful purpose.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many days it took God to create the heavens 
	and the earth, and the consistency between various Koranic positions as well 
	as between these positions and what modern science says on the subject, have 
	been serious bones of contention. Given the overwhelming evidence&nbsp; that the 
	universe is several billion years old, and not a mere few thousand years, 
	Koran’s interpreters have tried to wriggle out of the conundrum by 
	suggesting that God’s “day” should not be measured in the way man measures 
	it. Yusuf Ali too pursues that line of argument. He, moreover, does not see 
	any contradiction in the different measures of the “day” (ranging from 1,000 
	years in human reckoning in <i>sura</i> <i>Sajdah</i>, XXXII:5, &nbsp;to 50,000 
	years in <i>sura Ma`arij</i> ( LXX:4). To him these large numbers only mean 
	“very long periods.” (See his notes to XXXII: 4). However, the question that 
	remains is why the “long” periods are measured in so different ways, when a 
	single measure would have been appropriate, and would have made the life of&nbsp; 
	us mortals a little less complicated.. And, while discussing <i>sura H&#363;d </i>
	( XI:7),&nbsp; where God’s throne was on the waters ( presumably because the 
	heavens and the earth were still being created), Yusuf Ali refers to the 
	“scientifically correct” idea that life evolved out of water. But he 
	apparently does not know what to do with this information in the context of 
	the issue being discussed in the Koran, and maintains that the whole notion 
	was only metaphorical. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>sura al-Hajj</i>,<i> </i>XXII: 2, we find a 
	horrendous scene of the Day of Judgment when nursing mothers “shall forget 
	her suckling -babe” and “every pregnant female shall drop her load 
	(unformed)”.&nbsp; I have never been able to reconcile the purported mercy of God 
	with this scene, particularly the latter where every pregnant female, pious 
	ones presumably included, suffers miscarriage. Moreover, they have not yet 
	been judged. &nbsp;Why, Merciful God! &nbsp;Surely this is a most ungodly scene. One 
	would be hard put to explain such appalling scenes of human misery and 
	degradation. So is Yusuf Ali. His way out is simply to read the whole verse 
	metaphorically! But surely this is stretching metaphors too far.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To remain on the subject of God’s wrath, <i>sura 
	R&#363;m</i>, XXX:41, reads: “ Mischief has appeared on land and sea because of 
	(the meed) that the hands of men have earned, that (God) may give them a 
	taste of some of their deeds: in order that they may turn back (from evil).” 
	&nbsp;In other words, natural calamities are punishment from God. That is the 
	meaning of the sentence in, for example, the well-known Saudi sponsored 
	Bengali translation and interpretation of the Koran by Maulana Muhiuddin 
	Khan. We also hear this every time there is an earthquake of a cyclone. The 
	clear causation seen in the verse, between man’s misdeeds and natural 
	calamities, is turned by Yusuf Ali into this veritable gibberish: “God’s 
	Creation was pure and good in itself. All the mischief or corruption was 
	introduced by Evil, <i>viz</i>., arrogance, selfishness, etc…….As soon as 
	the mischief has come in, God’s mercy and goodness step in to stop it.” He 
	actually has turned the statement of the verse on its head and by “mischief” 
	he means not calamities but man’s corruption. This hardly makes any sense 
	when the verse is read in its entirety. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much dissimulation has been used by Islamic 
	commentators when it cmes to questions relating to the wives of the Prophet 
	of Islam. Yusuf Ali is no exception. It is indeed hard to explain some of 
	the events surrounding some of the wives. Aisha, for example, was only six 
	years old when the Prophet married her and was nine when the marriage was 
	consummated, when he was well over fifty. Yusuf Ali explains (in footnote to 
	XXXIII:28 ( <i>sura Ahjab</i>)) the rationale of the marriages after the 
	death of Khadija. One explanation was that the Prophet needed “help in his 
	duties of leadership, with women, who had to be instructed and kept together 
	in the large Muslim family… Hadhrat&nbsp; Aisha, daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr, 
	was clever and learned…”. But could this really be the reason for the 
	marriage? Aisha was only six years old at the time!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the same vein, Yusuf Ali puts the best gloss 
	possible over the episode of the Prophet marrying the wife of his adopted 
	son. He makes much of the alleged unhappiness in the conjugal life of 
	Zainab, Zaid’s wife, who also happened to be related to the Prophet. To 
	Yusuf Ali, “it is no part of God’s Plan to torture people in a bond which 
	should be a source of happiness but actually a source of misery.” A number 
	of questions arise here not the least of which are: first, omniscient God 
	could surely have prevented the marriage in the first place; second, could 
	no suitable groom, other than the Prophet, be found in the whole of Arab 
	land for Zainab when she was divorced by Zaid; third, if a father –and- son 
	relationship between a man and his adopted son was such an abomination, why 
	was it not denounced before the sura was revealed?&nbsp; &nbsp;About the last 
	question, in other words, why did it take an event like that of the Prophet 
	marrying Zainab, to trigger a condemnation of the practice of adoption, and 
	not the other way around? You will scant find an answer to such questions in 
	Yusuf Ali, or anywhere else for that matter. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Liberal commentators of the Koran are often torn 
	between a desire to come up with an interpretation of its verses that does 
	not subvert common sense and human knowledge accumulated through 
	observation, inquiry and critical thinking on the one hand, and their faith 
	in the Book as the word of God, on the other.&nbsp; This indeed is the basic 
	reason for the many incongruities in their interpretations that worry the 
	modern mind. Here in <i>sura</i> <i>Saaffat</i> (XXXVII), verses 1 through 
	10, are scenes of angels standing in serried ranks guarding the Exalted 
	Assembly from the evil spirits, and shooting stars pursuing any such spirits 
	who have snatched away something by stealth. Such scenes defy human 
	knowledge and reason. The dilemma for the liberal interpreter is starkly 
	demonstrated by Yusuf Ali’s handling of the scene.&nbsp; The slant of his 
	interpretation in the first few verses of the sura is given by a mixture of 
	mysticism, poetic imagery and spirituality. But the device fails when he 
	comes to verse 10 where he has to accept the shooting star as a physical 
	entity, which raises the obvious question: how does a shooting star repel an 
	evil spirit in the spiritual sense?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be easy enough, though laborious, to 
	continue with examples of such dissimulation. But, for constraints of time 
	and space, let us end with the final two <i>suras</i> of the Koran. <i>Suras 
	&nbsp;Falaq</i> &nbsp;(CXIII) and <i>Nas</i> ( CXIV) are among the most recited verses 
	of the Book. Among the verses of these <i>suras </i>are supplications to God 
	for protection against “the mischief of those who practise Secret Arts”, or 
	the “mischief of the Whisperer”. To the modern mind, these phenomena 
	themselves would be considered superstition. The irony is that Yusuf Ali 
	considers these verses themselves, as he puts it, “antidote to 
	superstition”! Surely, one does not need an antidote to superstition, such 
	as sorcery, unless he believes in it. &nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</p>
