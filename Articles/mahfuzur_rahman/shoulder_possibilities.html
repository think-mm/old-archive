	&nbsp;<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If you happen to visit the 
				Botanical Gardens at Mirpur on the outskirts of the city, look 
				right as you line up at the single file entrance. You will see a 
				tiny shop, if you can call it that. It is but a lone wood and 
				glass showcase, out in the open under a scorching sun, and 
				stuffed with packets of snacks and topped with bottled water and 
				cold drinks. On the front of the show case you will find these 
				words written in bold caption in Bangla: Ei rakhlam haat 
				shombhabonar kandhe, which translates into the title of the 
				present paragraphs.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				I was at the Gardens to photograph flowers. The lotuses were 
				simply beautiful. They thoroughly compensated me for last year’s 
				disappointment. To me it took some time for the message of the 
				sentence to sink in. And who wrote it? I asked. Was it a line 
				out of a modern Bengali poem? I quizzed friends with literary 
				bends. No, it was not from any modern poem they knew of. 
				Intrigued, I went back to the Gardens. The subterfuge used was 
				that I wanted a second look at the lotuses, this time with 
				sparkling rain drops on their magnificent leaves. It did rain 
				that day.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				A young boy was in charge at the shop. I asked him who wrote 
				those words. He did not know, he said, but I could ask the 
				owner. I did. The owner turned out to be a young man perhaps in 
				his late twenties. Where did he find those words? I wanted to 
				know. “No where”, he said, “These are my words. I wrote them 
				myself.” Then he explained. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				He has a master’s degree in political science. But he could not 
				find a job. For ten long years it had been a struggle to 
				survive. The snack stand at the entrance of the Botanical 
				Gardens was where he finally hoped to find success. He was 
				determined to make it work. This was where he rested his hand on 
				the shoulder of possibilities.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				I thought the words were brilliant poetry, congratulated him, 
				wished him success, and left. But the words did not leave me. 
				They continued to haunt me. How many thousands of young men and 
				women, like the author of those words, dream new dreams every 
				day for a better life, or at least renew them every day! I 
				wondered. And how many thousands of dreams are dashed every day! 
				As our car raced back to the city, hundreds of tiny roadside 
				shops sped by. How many of them are symbols of hope and not 
				desperation? Were they all shoulders of possibilities? One 
				should hope they were. There must be thousands of individual 
				success stories in the country. We read about them in newspaper 
				reports. Some of them came creeping back into my thoughts. There 
				must be a thousand shoulders of possibilities.</font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				Yet did we not, as a nation too, start with a hand on a shoulder 
				of huge possibilities? People who fought for independence from 
				foreign rule had a vision of a strong democratic, secular, 
				liberal society that would open up enormous opportunities for 
				individual and collective fulfillment. That goal remains a 
				distant dream. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				We had gone only a short distance from the Gardens when our car 
				was caught in an unexpected traffic jam. As we crawled along, we 
				realized something was wrong. There was large police presence at 
				street intersections. Some streets had been barricaded. We made 
				detours. Our driver craned his neck from his window. What was 
				up, he asked someone. A prominent businessman had been murdered 
				for refusing to pay extortion money. There had been large scale 
				violence in the streets as a result. I was reminded of countless 
				hundreds of people killed by extortionists over the past few 
				years. Law enforcing agencies, damning law, have themselves 
				killed many hundreds, supposedly to stop such extortions. Back 
				on the main road, we passed large hand painted slogans demanding 
				punishment to killers of Bongobondhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. I 
				was reminded that it had been three decades since the murder and 
				yet the nation had not found the collective will to punish the 
				killer. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				The trip from the Gardens ended. Soon we were back in the safety 
				of home. A few days later the nation was rocked to its 
				foundations as Islamist militants carried out some five hundred 
				bombings across the country. That was days before the first 
				anniversary of the August 21 2004 grenade attacks that took the 
				lives of twenty two innocent people and wounded hundreds in an 
				act of unprecedented savagery. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
				Can the vendor by the gate of the Botanical Gardens and the 
				thousands like him long keep their grip on the shoulder of 
				possibilities if the nation loses its on its own? </font></p>
