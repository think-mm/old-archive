  <span style="font-family:Verdana;color:black"><font size="2">The human spirit 
  undefeated: Standing atop the ruins of a house in Muzzaffarabad. (<i>courtesy: 
				Daily Star</i>)</font></span><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333"><br>
  <br>
  Above the valleys and mountains in Kashmir, 
  above the limitless stretches of wrecked homes and human lives, rises a 
  rending cry, a soulful moan, thrown up in unison from a million hearts: why? 
  An unbearable sadness echoes across nations and around the world.</span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">On October 
  8 the earth shook in northern Pakistan, leaving a large swathe of Kashmir and adjoining areas in ruins. This followed 
  less than a year after a giant tsunami churned the seas and devastated far 
  flung lands. The tsunami killed almost a quarter of a million people in half a 
  dozen countries. The earthquake that struck Pakistan 
  killed over 70,000 people in an area a fraction of the size of the lands hit 
  by the tsunami. It also killed hundreds in Indian Kashmir. </span>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">&quot;Why does 
  such human tragedy happen?&quot; I asked my interlocutor after the earthquake. 
  &quot;Some say these are acts of God. Can this be true? There is, for example, a 
  Pakistan-born fundamentalist woman living and teaching in Canada who has said 
  publicly that deaths in the Pakistani earthquake were God's punishment for 
  &quot;immoral activities&quot; of the people there. But there are many others around the 
  world who share her belief. &quot; </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">&quot;I do not 
  know&quot;, was his all too familiar reply, &quot;but people whose opinion it is that 
  God sends mankind natural calamities as punishment for bad behaviour can quote 
  from the holy books to support their view.&quot; He went on to quote the following 
  verse from the Koran: </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">&quot;Mischief 
  has appeared on land and sea because of (the meed) that the hands of men have 
  earned, that (God) may give them a taste of some of their deeds: in order that 
  they may turn back (from evil).&quot; (XXX: 41) </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">&quot;But, wait 
  a minute,&quot; I said, &quot;there were thousands of children among the dead in the 
  earthquake. Many of them were only school children, crushed by collapsing 
  class rooms. Surely, they were too young to do evil and deserve punishment.&quot;
  </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">&quot;That is 
  true&quot;, said my interlocutor, &quot;but, the argument goes, God may have His own 
  design, which human beings cannot comprehend. It may be better to leave things 
  at that.&quot; </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">Still 
  puzzled, I asked: &quot;But how is it that the earthquake killed mainly in Muslim 
  Kashmir and spared India, the mainly Hindu state? How is it that God is so 
  much more severe on Muslims than on Hindus. Also, why did the tsunami victims 
  have to be overwhelmingly Muslim? Did you also notice that most of the latter 
  were in the Indonesian province of Aceh where there has been a resurgence of 
  fundamentalist Islam?&quot; </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">As usual, 
  my interlocutor mumbled something in reply and was off, just as I was going to 
  ask him why God inflicted the calamity upon fasting Muslims in the holy month 
  of Ramadan. I returned to my musings. I could not help noting that the 
  ultra-conservative evangelist Pat Robertson also sees a connection between 
  God's wrath and natural disaster. </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">While 
  apocalyptic visions are by their nature opaque to rationality and human 
  intelligence, the human dimensions of natural disasters are clear enough. 
  There is nothing that man can do to prevent an earthquake, a tsunami, a 
  landslide, or a cyclone. But his response to calamities that occasionally 
  bring havoc to the only habitable planet he has ever known can be at least as 
  remarkable as his puniness against nature. </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">Among the 
  images of immediate response to the tragedy in Pakistan, was the arrival of a 
  British rescue team within hours of the quake. The gesture was noble as well 
  as supremely useful. It saved lives. In a country that is haunted by the 
  spectre of Islamic fundamentalism, it was heart warming to see members of 
  another faith, or people with no faith at all, saving Muslim lives and to see 
  the help gratefully acknowledged. It was hardly less remarkable to see dogs, 
  man's best friend in the west but an unclean animal in much of the Muslim 
  world, pressed into service to find victims of the disaster. The rescue 
  operation, like many such in other circumstances, tore through barriers that 
  separate man from man -- and from beast. </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">Within 
  hours of the disaster, too, India came with offers of help, while its own 
  people were also victims of the earthquake, though there were mercifully far 
  fewer of them than in Pakistan. Given the intractable hostility between the 
  two countries, it is easy to be cynical about India's 
  offer of help. But the offer was genuinely humanitarian and was accepted, even 
  if with reservations. The aftermath of the disaster even offered glimpses of 
  hope for easing of tension between the two countries. There are few phenomena 
  in human relations more heart warming than old enemies coming together to 
  bring succour to the afflicted. </span>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">This did 
  not of course prevent a lone suicide bomber, a woman clad in burqa, from 
  blowing herself up, trying to blow up Indian military vehicles coming to the 
  assistance of earthquake victims in Indian Kashmir. Neither is the zeal of 
  Islamist extremists in bringing relief to the stricken people in Pakistani 
  Kashmir devoid of political aims. Yet the action of the suicide bomber and the 
  motivations of the militants only underline the human dimensions of the 
  problem, as against the divine, that human beings themselves have to sort out. 
  No amount of apocalyptic vision will help. </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">The loss of 
  life and property in Pakistan has been enormous. The government of the country 
  has put the estimated cost of reconstruction at some 5 billon dollars. There 
  is a feeling that this is not an overestimation. The immediate relief 
  available from the rest of the world has not been insignificant, though it has 
  fallen short of the response to the Asian tsunami, both as to its speed and 
  its size. The international community should be as generous now as it was for 
  the tsunami victims. There cannot be a better use of the world's resources. 
  Pakistan's national priorities must change too. The purchase of some 
  sophisticated arms from abroad has, we are told, been postponed. Why not 
  abandon it altogether and use the resources released for reconstruction and 
  economic development? </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">A disaster 
  like an earthquake hit the rich and the poor alike, but not equally. The well 
  to do generally live in better built houses. Their survival rate in a calamity 
  is thus much higher than among the poor living in ramshackle housing. Proper 
  housing for the poor should go a considerable way in mitigating the effects of 
  natural disasters. Construction of buildings -- houses and schools -- that can 
  be expected to withstand shocks of earthquakes must be a priority in any 
  medium and long-term plan for rebuilding human life in Pakistan. Many mosques 
  stood the onslaught of the Asian tsunami and this was much touted as divine 
  intervention. But the fact that the houses of worship are often, but not 
  always, spared by natural disasters while other structures collapse can be 
  easily explained in non-divine terms: the former are generally strongly built, 
  while many of the latter, particularly those housing the poor, are all too 
  flimsy. </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">The very 
  acts of humanity by neighbours coming to the rescue also suggest the need for 
  strengthening regional cooperation. The ability to come to the aid of the 
  stricken should increase enormously if there were permanent mechanisms of 
  regional response. That ability should increase if there are intra-regional 
  infrastructures like road, rail, and air links. One hopes that the schemes of 
  regional cooperation like Saarc would give due weight to these considerations.
  </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">There is in 
  fact a great deal that man can do when the earth shakes, particularly by way 
  of bringing the human community together. </span></p>
