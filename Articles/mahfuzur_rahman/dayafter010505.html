	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">OF late, there has been a 
	groundswell of demand for trial of people who committed war crimes during 
	the liberation struggle of the country some thirty-seven years ago. It is 
	time, too. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There can be no doubt that 
	perpetrators of crimes against humanity must be brought to book. It is 
	rarely too late to put them in the dock. Those who killed, tortured, maimed, 
	and raped to stop the emergence of Bangladesh must account for their 
	conduct, no matter how long ago the crimes might have been committed. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yet, the loud calls for action have 
	tended to obscure many critical issues that war crimes trials alone will 
	never resolve. The drumbeat, if you like, has drowned out many other sounds 
	that need to be heard. It is also necessary to understand the mainspring and 
	motivation of the demands for the trials. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To start with, who are calling for 
	the trials? Many of them are undoubtedly motivated by the genuine pain of 
	witnessing years of apathy about the matter. I dare say, there are also many 
	whose wish to see justice done appears little more than skin-deep. The 
	motley gathering of the late protesters is worth watching. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It includes many of those who had 
	the power to bring the criminals to justice but did precious little about 
	it. Many of them are from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Awami 
	League, and the Jatiya Party (choose a faction), all of whom governed the 
	country over the last thirty-six years at one time or the other. Of them, 
	the longest tenure was of the BNP. Yet, many leaders of that party have now 
	joined those calling for trial of the war criminals. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Perhaps the oddest thing is the 
	frequent statements from leaders of these parties that the initiative for 
	action “must come from the government.” You might be forgiven if you doubted 
	you were hearing right. Leaders who are now saying that it is the 
	government, which must start the process of putting alleged war criminals on 
	trial, were themselves the government. What had they been doing when in 
	power? It all smells distinctly hypocritical. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then why are these people so vocal 
	in their call for war-crimes trials? The question can legitimately be asked 
	about some of those demanding the trial, though certainly not about all. One 
	answer readily suggests itself. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There has been a new awareness among 
	the population of the enormous sacrifices made during the liberation war. 
	Resurgence is probably too strong a word, but it is popular now to denounce 
	war crimes. Some of the political leaders may simply have been playing to 
	the gallery, the elections being on the horizon, or appearing to be. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But suppose a government comes into 
	office that genuinely wants to put the war-criminals on trial. Suppose it 
	hangs the guilty or jails them for life. What happens then? I do not believe 
	that much will happen to the political landscape of the country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is because, like the pernicious 
	iceberg, the question of hostility to the ideology of Bangladesh that led to 
	the crimes lies mostly submerged, the trials calling attention only to its 
	tip above water. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today, there is little attention to 
	the dangerous bottom nine-tenths; the day after the culprits have been 
	punished will be no different. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One likely consequence of the trials 
	may even be that political parties whose ideologies are opposed to the very 
	idea of a secular Bangladesh will be able to claim that the punishment of 
	the culprits of the past gives them a clean slate now. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If the matter is only one of 
	punishment of individuals and not the parties they belong to, then the 
	punishment of the individuals can be turned into an advantage by the 
	parties. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With the culprits gone, the parties 
	can claim to be squeaky-clean inheritors of the original idea of Bangladesh. 
	This is a bizarre scenario, but not unlikely. Given that the number of the 
	war criminals has inevitably been dwindling through death, these political 
	parties could be in a happy state of claiming legitimacy in exchange for a 
	relatively light penalty. A way must be found to deny them that claim.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The demand for war trials in the 
	last few months has left out the far more important threat posed by the 
	continuing spread of forces that are opposed to the idea of a secular 
	Bangladesh. One feels the absence across the boardin speeches, statements, 
	newspaper articles. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A recent speech by a noted 
	intellectual-economist whom I admire is perhaps typical in this regard. Its 
	theme was the failure of the nation to put the war criminals on trial and 
	the consequences of such inaction. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Among our failures he talked of many 
	things: our inability to achieve the goals of a just and democratic society, 
	the failures of the political parties, growing gap between the rich and the 
	poor --it is difficult to see the connection between these very legitimate 
	concerns and the trial of war criminals --but there isn't a single mention 
	of the threat to the secular ideology of Bangladesh. The killing and torture 
	in 1971 were committed basically in the name of an anti-Bangladesh ideology. 
	And we do not mention its menace when we call for trial of the perpetrators. 
	That is the nine-tenths of the iceberg. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is no greater or nobler raison 
	d'être for the creation of Bangladesh than the ideology of secularism and 
	pluralism that started to bloom during the language movement in the early 
	1950s. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Almost three decades ago, Professor 
	Muzaffar Ahmed, a respected left-wing politician, said secularism in the 
	context of Bangladesh was even more important than democracy. The comparison 
	may well be disputed, but the point was spot-on. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The erosion of secularism in the 
	political landscape of the country has often been mentioned, and has 
	remained unheeded. This has gone hand in hand with the increasing 
	Islamisation of public life in the country, and a continuing threat from 
	radical political Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of the latter, the violent 
	demonstrations around Baitul Mukarram not long ago to protest against the 
	alleged anti-Koran stance of a new national policy on women recently 
	approved by the government, is only the latest, and perhaps not among the 
	most blatant, instance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the past couple of years, 
	militants have gone on rampage around the country, with bombings, 
	assassinations, and threats to religious minorities. They have stifled 
	freedom of expression with violent demonstrations of self-inflicted outrage. 
	After a relatively quiet past few months, they appear to be gathering 
	strength. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">More than incidentally, these people 
	will not be anywhere near the purview of a war- crimes tribunal, and, yet, 
	they are as much a threat to the secular ideology of Bangladesh as those who 
	fought that ideology in 1971. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nor will those who seek to Islamise 
	public life in Bangladesh in “peaceful” ways. Nor will the calls for war 
	crimes trials by themselves focus attention on the many subtle ways in which 
	secularism has come under attack in the country, not excluding seemingly 
	innocuous pronouncements by many of the leaders of the country themselves, 
	elected or presumptive. </font></p>
