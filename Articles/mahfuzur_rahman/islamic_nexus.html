				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been quite 
				some time since September 11, 2001. Yet every time I look out of 
				my Manhattan apartment window towards the emptiness in the 
				skyline where the World Trade Center once stood, I am filled 
				with sadness. What makes human beings commit such atrocity?</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The tale of 
				terrorist atrocities in recent times stretches from New York to 
				Bali, from Baghdad to Beslan to Karachi. The September 2001 
				attacks in the US killed over three thousand innocent people. 
				The October 2002 Bali bombings killed nearly two hundred. Among 
				the latest violence, suicide bombers killed dozens of children 
				in Iraq as they stood in line for sweets at a ceremony, and in 
				Pakistan a mosque was the target of a suicide bombing, 
				presumably by a Sunni Muslim, that killed at least twenty five 
				Shi‘ite Muslim worshippers.&nbsp; What makes human beings kill 
				themselves in order to kill others, who usually are innocent 
				civilians, women and children included? What motivates 
				terrorists to shoot school children as they try to flee their 
				captors, as they did in Beslan ? What impels men to slaughter 
				their victims like sacrificial beasts, and flaunt the cruelty in 
				front of television cameras? </span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terrorism has come 
				in various shades. Of these, the one that has gained the 
				greatest currency is of rather recent origin: suicide terrorism, 
				in which the terrorist kills himself in order to kill others. 
				Since this is accomplished by the use of a bombing device, such 
				action has added ‘suicide bombing’ to the lexicon. But crashing 
				an aircraft into a target by a passenger determined to kill 
				himself in order to kill others also falls into that sinister 
				category. Taking innocent people hostage and then slaughtering 
				them is the newest form of terrorism, one that has filled the 
				gory calendar of violence in Iraq in recent days. Women who have 
				not, in the eyes of the terrorist, dressed modestly enough have 
				had their throats slit. Assassination of dissenters in matters 
				of religion has a long history and has continued into recent 
				times.&nbsp; </span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be 
				recognized, except by the totally blinkered, that the bombings, 
				suicide bombings, and murder of hostages we are talking about 
				have been undertaken by people who are often described, in the 
				absence of a better term, as “Islamist terrorists.” This is not 
				to turn a blind eye to terrorist acts by people of other faiths 
				that killed and maimed in the recent past. The Irish Republican 
				Army and the Basque separatist group ETA easily come to mind as 
				does the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka who have killed hundreds, 
				including women and children, in suicide and non-suicide 
				bombings. But, apart from the fact that violence from these 
				groups has subsided or stopped, the scope of their brutality 
				would pale in comparison with the recent spate of killings by 
				terrorists who do not just happen to be Muslims but who commit 
				the brutality in the name of Islam.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not that the 
				question of terrorism by Islamist militants has not been on many 
				minds. Indeed, writings by western scholars of Islam on the 
				connection between Islam and violence have grown apace. But the 
				question has not been asked loudly and clearly enough by people 
				who must: Muslims themselves. The very mention of the subject of 
				‘Islamic’ terrorism often raises many hackles among Muslims; it 
				no longer should. &nbsp;Since much, if not most, of the terrorism in 
				recent years has been committed in the name of Islam, it is time 
				Muslims undertook a dispassionate examination of its alleged 
				‘Islamic’ inspiration.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions on 
				terrorism among Muslims have mostly shied away from this area of 
				inquiry.&nbsp; Instead, there is, first, the apologist who would 
				rationalize acts of terror by pointing to injustice and 
				oppression that are supposed to have given rise to them. Then 
				there is the ‘sociologist’, explaining the socio-economic roots 
				of terrorism. And there are those who are mortified by acts of 
				terrorism but rarely venture beyond suggesting that Islam does 
				not condone violence of any sort, far less terrorism, and that 
				Islam is a religion of peace. Finally, there are those who have 
				alleged hypocrisy and religious intolerance on the part of the 
				west itself which are supposed to disqualify it from criticizing 
				militant Islam. </span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That people who 
				have suffered long periods of injustice and oppression would 
				turn to violence to achieve their legitimate aspirations should 
				not be surprising. Perhaps the most important example of this 
				kind of protest is to be found in Israeli occupied land in 
				Palestine. The statistics of violence and killing in that area 
				of conflict parallel those of Iraq today. There is also little 
				doubt that a permanent solution to the Palestinian-Israeli 
				problem would sharply reduce hatred and violence among the 
				long-suffering population in that corner of the world as well 
				elsewhere. But this will not end acts of terrorism by Islamist 
				militants. The plight of the Palestinians does contribute to 
				Muslim anger all over the world, and rightly so, but it does not 
				explain how anger, whatever the cause, finds its awful 
				fulfilment in acts of bombings, suicide bombings or beheading of 
				hapless victims. Similarly inadequate are the other 
				“explanations” of terrorism I mention above. One needs to look 
				elsewhere.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a refugee camp 
				in north-west Pakistan, soon after the rout of the Taliban in 
				Afghanistan in 2002, a young Muslim militant was asked by a 
				western journalist what had induced him to be ready to die in a 
				suicide bombing, if necessary. “If I die I shall be in the 
				highest heaven eating grapes, and enjoying the company of <i>
				huris</i>”, was the answer. Among the documents found by the FBI 
				on one of the nineteen September 11 hijackers was this 
				assurance: “You will soon be, with God’s permission, with your 
				heavenly brides in Heaven. Smile in the face of death young man. 
				You are headed to the Paradise of Eternity.” [Source: Peter 
				Bergen, <i>Holy War Inc</i>, Simon and Schuster. 2001. p.24]. 
				The sentiment of the young warrior in Pakistan should not be 
				dismissed as merely anecdotal. Neither need one question the 
				deadly earnestness of the belief of the September eleven 
				hijacker in glorious martyrdom. </span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Behind suicide 
				bombings and beheadings and other acts of terrorism lies a 
				deeply held belief that Islam sanctions them and that those who 
				die in the course of such acts will be rewarded in the 
				afterlife. And there is a formidable array of fundamentalist 
				ideologues who have helped shape that belief. They have been all 
				too willing to demonstrate that Islamist terrorism has 
				theological roots. A list of such ideologues might start with 
				Sayyid Qutb, perhaps the most important Egyptian proponent of 
				purist Islam and the putative father of modern Islamic 
				radicalism, and would of course include Bin Laden, himself well 
				versed in Qur’an and <i>hadith</i>, and his ideological mentor 
				Ayman al-Zawahiri. Down the list one would come across people 
				like Abu Hamza al-Masri of London who had only praise for the 
				September 11 attackers, or Muhammed Metin Keplan of the State of 
				Califate movement whose picture, sword in hand, I once saw, to 
				name only a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although a 
				majority of the world Muslim population would condemn terrorism 
				in all its forms, the urge to use violence, or at least 
				acquiesce in it, is hardly restricted to a few radical 
				theocratic leaders. Jubilation among large sections of the 
				population in a number of Muslim countries that followed the 
				colossal loss of human lives in the World Trade Centre attacks 
				is a sad fact. The brutal rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan 
				drew its strength from a very substantial number of 
				foot-soldiers of literalist Islam. Saif al-Islam al-Gadaffi, son 
				of Colonel Gadaffi of Libya, said in a recent interview with a 
				western newspaper that if a free election were to be held today 
				in the Arab world, al-Qaeda would win.[Financial Times, 
				September 11/September 12, 2004]&nbsp; A recent poll conducted in a 
				range of 12 Muslim countries found that a large proportion of 
				the population, varying between 13 percent and 73 percent, 
				&nbsp;justified suicide bombing in defence of Islam. In a number of 
				countries the proportion is larger than that of people who do 
				not condone such act. [Source: Pew Research Center for the 
				People and the Press. <i>

				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is rather easy

				more can be added. For reasons of space, I have mostly

				<span lang="EN-US">Some of these quotations have sometimes been 
				cited by western scholars of Islam to support their contention 
				that there is something inherently militant in this particular 
				brand of monotheistic faith. The contention was recently brought 
				closer to home when Prof. Hans G. Kippenberg of the University 
				of Eufurt, Germany, dwelt on the subject at a symposium in 
				Dhaka, specifically referring to the Quranic verse IX:5, cited 
				above, among others. The professor’s critique of Islam 
				reportedly provoked sharp reaction from Muslim participants in 
				the discussion. But it so happens that here he has an unlikely 
				ally &nbsp;in the Islamist militants themselves &nbsp;who may find in the 
				above citations ample justification for militancy. So it was 
				that a British Muslim militant of Pakistani origin could claim 
				that there is no way the Qur’an could be interpreted except 
				literally, and say “if [in the Qur’an] Allah says fight, you 
				fight. How can anyone take a moderate view of this?” [<i>The 
				Struggle for the soul of Islam</i>, a special report, Time, 
				September 13, 2004.] It will be seen below that some the 
				traditionalist Islamic interpretations of the Islamic holy books 
				also hold a position that is not far apart from that of this 
				militant. To be sure, there are counsels of restraint in some 
				these verses and elsewhere. But in these verses a militant could 
				also find, more clearly in IX: 5 and IX: 29 than in others, 
				truce only on Islam’s terms.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the 
				quotations above do not mention the word, they are essentially 
				about <i>Jihad</i> in its conventional meaning of war against 
				the infidels. The expression <i>Jihad </i>does of course occur 
				in the Qur’an. Examples of verses where <i>Jihad </i>has been 
				used include: II: 218 (<i>Sura Baqara</i>) which says: “Those 
				who believed and those who suffered exile and fought (and strove 
				and struggled) in the path of God,--they have the hope of the 
				Mercy of God;…” ; and&nbsp; IX:73 (<i>Sura Tauba</i>): “O Prophet! 
				Strive hard against the Unbelievers and the Hypocrites….”. 
				Verses VIII:72, VIII:74, and VIII:75 are some of the other 
				examples.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Jihad</i> as a 
				phenomenon is much on the minds of western critics of Islam, 
				even when they acknowledge that religious wars were hardly 
				unknown in the west.&nbsp; While they see the latter as a phenomenon 
				long past, they tend to see in acts of Islamist terrorism a 
				reflection of an unchanging &nbsp;<i>jihad</i>ist ethos. But many 
				Muslims themselves find the concept of <i>jihad</i>, in its 
				essence, as valid today as it was fourteen centuries ago. The 
				two quotations above, chosen at random, are particularly apt in 
				the present context because the interpretation of the word 
				“fought” ( <i>Jahadu</i>, from <i>Jihad</i>, in the original&nbsp; 
				Arabic), given in parentheses by Yusuf Ali in the first verse, 
				and &nbsp;his translation of the word <i>Jihad </i>given in the 
				second, have become a popular response of liberal Muslims to the 
				charge that violence is inherent in Islam. <i>Jihad,</i> in this 
				interpretation of the word, simply means struggle against evil 
				waged mainly in the mind of man, and therefore has a spiritual 
				connotation as well. But traditional exegesists of the Qur’an 
				have different interpretations of the word <i>Jihad</i>. Thus, 
				in Muhiuddin Khan’s translation, the word is used in its 
				traditional meaning of simply “fighting”, and this goes well 
				with the preceding verses which dwell on fighting in the 
				physical sense. This is also the sense in which it has been used 
				in most of Islamic history. And this suits the Islamist militant 
				well. </span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is also the 
				meaning of <i>Jihad</i> most traditionalist Muslims are familiar 
				with. A well-known Bengali Islamic theologian of the traditional 
				school, while accepting that, among the several meanings of the 
				word <i>Jihad</i>, striving against evil is an important one, 
				emphasized: “Those who exclude the taking up of arms and mean by
				<i>Jihad</i> only other efforts have fallen victims to a grave, 
				western-inspired, mistake.” &nbsp;[Buhkari Sharif (in Bengali). 
				Translation and commentary by Maulana Azizul Haq, Hamidia 
				Library, Dhaka.1996. Vol.3. P.45. Translation from the Bengali 
				mine). He actually goes much further than this. In discussing 
				the battle of Badr, Islam’s first major battle against the 
				unbelievers, he has this to say: “A recently- born group of 
				Islam-loving writers has refused to accept that the battle of 
				Badr, describe<i>d in Bukhari Sharif, </i>was an offensive 
				action. In their opinion, there is no offensive <i>Jihad</i> in 
				Islam; there is only defensive <i>Jihad</i>. This is an absurd 
				and baseless view.”&nbsp; [<i>ibid</i>. p.116 Translation from the 
				Bengali &nbsp;mine.]&nbsp; Such a point of view must be welcome grist in 
				the Muslim militant’s mill, and has a close affinity to the 
				position of the Islamic radical I quoted above. It is also a 
				point of view that is shared by a large section of 
				traditionalist theologians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The militant who 
				finds justification for acts of violence could also heap scorn 
				on the faint -hearted ‘moderates’ by referring to a host of <i>
				hadith</i> and history, even though there are instances of 
				compassion as well in both. He could for example cite the 
				killing of the entire male population, believed to number 
				between 600 and 700, of the Jewish tribe of Banu Quraiza in 627 
				AD/ 5AH, soon after the battle of the Trench [ Source: Ibn 
				Ishaq, <i>Sirat Rasul Allah</i>, English translation entitled <i>
				The Life Muhammad</i> by A. Guillaume, Oxford University Press, 
				Karachi. 1967.p. 464.]&nbsp; Also, he would argue, did not the 
				Prophet of Islam (SM) mete out punishments like cutting off 
				hands and feet and blinding, by use of a hot iron rod, of a 
				group of people for the murder of a Muslim shepherd? [Source: <i>
				Sahih Al-Bukhari</i>, translated by Muhammad Muhsin Khan, 
				Darussalam Publishers, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 1997.Vol.7 p.329]. 
				As for assassination, he could again cite from Al-Bukhari [ <i>
				op.cit</i>. Vol. 5. pp.221-223.] and Ibn Ishaq [ <i>op.cit</i>. 
				p.368]&nbsp; the murder of the Jewish poet K’ab bin Al-Ashraf by the 
				Prophet’s companions. or the killing of Abu Rafi,&nbsp; a wealthy

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the war in 
				Iraq, three foreign contractors were murdered and their 
				mutilated bodies were hung from electricity transmission lines. 
				While that action was roundly condemned by many religious 
				leaders in Iraq, in early 2004 an Islamic website in Saudi 
				Arabia carried a <i>fatwa </i>by a prominent Islamic cleric 
				approving mutilation of corpses of infidels, after two suicide 
				bombings killed some twenty foreigners, and the bodies of two of 
				whom were dragged behind motor vehicles. The militants, backed 
				by theologians in the latter case, could possibly seek a 
				parallel here with the throwing into a pit bodies of twenty-four 
				Quraish fighters killed in the battle of Badr. [ <i>Sahih 
				Al-Bukhari</i>, <i>op.cit.</i> p.188.] They will of course be 
				hard put to find precedence for the killing of innocent 
				hostages, the latest of whom was a woman, and a converted Muslim 
				too, who had dedicated her life to improving the lot of the 
				unprivileged in developing countries. Acts of compassion in the 
				course of Islam’s history would naturally be lost on them.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said 
				that western critics of Islam often use “isolated” quotations 
				from the Qur’an to make their point. At the Dhaka seminar, one 
				of the charges against critics of Islam was their alleged use of 
				isolated quotations to support their argument. However, it can 
				also be argued that those who make such allegation do exactly 
				the same thing. If, for example, the use of quotations such as 
				II:191, or II:193.or IX:5 can be called an attempt to make a 
				point from only “isolated” verses, the same can be said of, say, 
				the use of II:256, or VI: 151 or V:32, discussed below, in 
				defence of the peaceful face of Islam.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; The response of 
				‘moderate’ Muslim thinkers to the radicals’ points of view has 
				so far been rather sparse and inadequate. Their efforts to show 
				that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance have generally 
				centred round a rather limited number of citations from the 
				Qur’an, apart from the liberal interpretation of <i>Jihad</i> 
				mentioned earlier. Perhaps the most widely used quotation has 
				been: “Let there be no compulsion in religion.” (<i>Sura Baqara</i>, 
				II:256)&nbsp; One can however argue that, in the present context, too 
				much has been read into this verse and very different 
				interpretations of it can be found. The verse does not obviate 
				those on <i>jehad</i> and killing, quoted above. It only means, 
				in the words of Yusuf Ali in his&nbsp; commentary on the Qur’an, 
				“Compulsion is incompatible with religion”, which is by itself 
				an important argument. The well-known Bengali translation of the 
				Qur’an and its exegesis by Muhiuddin Khan [ op.cit.] also 
				contends that the verse does not have anything to do with 
				violence against unbelievers, but goes on to say: “Reading this
				<i>ayat</i>, some might ask: this suggests that no force should 
				be applied in matters of religion, whereas Islam has taught to 
				conduct <i>jihad</i> and fight. Deep reflection should suggest 
				that such a question is not an appropriate one.” According to 
				this line of thinking, since Allah has asked that tumult and 
				oppression (<i>fitna</i> in Arabic) perpetrated by the <i>kafirs
				</i>be rid of through <i>jihad</i> and <i>qetal</i>, “killing of 
				transgressing oppressors [meaning the <i>kafirs</i>] is like 
				killing snakes or scorpions or some such animals that cause 
				pain.” (Translation mine.) The exegesis also points out, without 
				irony, that “[Islam] also prohibited the killing of persons who 
				have begun to pay the <i>Jyzia </i>and obey the [Islamic] laws.” 
				An Islamist militant would readily agree with such an exegesis. 
				The gulf between such a view and that of the moderates could not 
				be wider.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has also been 
				pointed out by defenders of Islam against allegations of 
				brutality being inherent in the religion, that the Qur’an 
				expressly forbids taking of innocent life. A verse sometimes 
				quoted in this connection is: “Take not life, which God hath 
				made sacred, except by way of justice and law.” (<i>Sura&nbsp; An’am</i>, 
				VI:151) This certainly is an important statement of principle; 
				it is also unique in that, unlike other general statements or 
				directives, it has not, to my knowledge, been repeated. It is, 
				nevertheless, useful to look at an exegesis of the verse. The 
				exegesis in the Muhiuddin Khan translation clearly emphasizes 
				the prohibition on the taking of Muslim life. On non- Muslim 
				life, there is an important proviso, however: “Just as it is 
				forbidden to kill a Muslim without reason, so it is forbidden to 
				kill a non-Muslim who lives in, and abides by the laws of, a 
				Muslim state.” If this interpretation is correct, the directive 
				in the verse appears a great deal less universal than it might 
				look at first sight. Furthermore, while Yusuf Ali has translated 
				the word <i>haqq</i> in the verse ( in “ …except by way of <i>
				haqq</i> ..)&nbsp; as “justice and law”, others &nbsp;(Muhammad Ali and 
				Pickthall, for example,) &nbsp;have translated it only as “in the 
				course of justice.” The Muhiuddin Khan exegesis uses the 
				expression “rightfully” in place of “in the course of justice” 
				and is vaguer. Justice and rightfulness can of course have 
				various interpretations. A terrorist can have its own, and often 
				does proclaim his as the only right, and Islamic, one.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On taking of life, 
				the following verse is significant and has sometimes been cited 
				as evidence of Islam’s disdain of killing: “ We ordained for the 
				Children of Israel that if any one slew a person – unless it be 
				for murder or for spreading mischief in the land—it would be as 
				if he slew the whole people …..”. ( <i>Sura Ma-ida</i>, V:32) A 
				follow-up of the story of Abel and Cain, this is indeed a strong 
				indictment of wrongful killing, and a terrorist would be hard 
				put to argue himself out of it. But he could still say he had 
				plenty of other verses to fall back on.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of 
				suicide bombing, there appears to be only one instance&nbsp; -- I 
				stand ready to be corrected – in the Qur’an where Muslims are 
				enjoined on not to kill themselves. This appears as part of 
				verse IV:29 (<i>Sura Nisa</i>): “ Nor kill yourself” ( <i>Wa</i>
				<i>La taqtulu</i> <i>anfusakum</i>) and has been quoted as an 
				example of Islam’s abhorrence of suicide. There are, however, 
				interpretations of the phrase in which the connotation of 
				suicide is altogether absent. Thus, Muhiuddin Khan’s translation 
				of the phrase is “And do not kill anyone from among yourself… &nbsp;” 
				(Translation from the Bengali mine), which totally changes the 
				meaning from suicide to killing. This interpretation is also 
				more consistent with the rest of the verse where “among 
				yourself” is the focus (Thus, in the Muhiuddin Khan version: “Ye 
				who believe eat not up each others’ property” (translation mine) 
				appears at the beginning of the verse). Pickthall similarly 
				translates the phrase unambiguously as “Kill not one another”, 
				and Muhammad Ali as “And kill not your people”. All three 
				interpretations do away with the putative injunction against 
				suicide—and, by implication, suicide bombings – to the 
				satisfaction of the militants.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The relationship 
				between the believers and the unbelievers of course lies at the 
				heart of the matter. There would not be any point in talking 
				about hostility to non-Muslims in a truly liberal society.&nbsp; 
				Muslims who would like to present the liberal, even pluralist, 
				face of Islam often quote: “Those who believe (in the Qur-&#257;n), 
				and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians 
				and the Sabians… shall have their reward with their Lord…” ( <i>
				Sura Baqara</i>, II:62), or “ Thus have We made of you an <i>
				Ummat</i> justly balanced…( <i>ibid</i>. II:143). In some 
				translations, the latter verse is: “We have made you a moderate 
				sect.”</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, once again, 
				there is a very different point of view in the following verses 
				from the Qur’an: “Let not the Believers take for friends or 
				helpers Unbelievers rather than Believers;” (<i>Sura Imran</i>, 
				III:28), or “ O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the 
				Christians for your friends and protectors.” ( <i>Sura Ma-ida</i>, 
				V: 51), or “ Strongest among men in enmity to the Believers wilt 
				thou find the Jews and Pagans:” ( <i>Sura Ma-ida</i> V:82).
				</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This concludes my 
				brief examination of the ‘Islamist’ nexus of terrorism. What can 
				one make of the wide divergence of views illustrated? Two 
				opposing positions, one that finds in Islam enough ground to 
				justify violence, while the other sees only peace and humanity, 
				cannot both be right. After all, the protagonists of both camps 
				can produce support for their point of view from the same 
				source. A potential way out of the stand-off is to place all 
				acts of violence in historical context: what is cruel or 
				abhorrent today was widely accepted as ‘normal’ earlier in the 
				evolution of human civilization. That more emphasis has not been 
				placed on the contexts is puzzling. Perhaps this reflects a 
				perceived difficulty related to the interpretation of the nature 
				of divine revelations. Strictly, if the Qur’an is the literal 
				word of God, every word of which is immutable, and if it is 
				valid for eternity, as orthodoxy emphasizes, the question of 
				context becomes quite complicated. </span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if the 
				‘moderate’ position looks rather inadequate and defensive, and 
				in some instances even appears to be undermined by traditional 
				interpretations of the Qur’an, there is a rather straightforward 
				explanation: religion is not primarily about love for humanity 
				in general, far less for those who do not belong to it. The 
				point is well worth emphasizing. While organized religion, be it 
				Judaism, or Christianity, or Islam, preaches peace, humanity, 
				and brotherhood among its adherents, it does not extend the same 
				benignity to those beyond its pale. Indeed, the <i>raison d’être</i> 
				for any religion is its claim of clear superiority to all other 
				faiths, and members of a religion would much rather have the 
				‘infidels’ join their fraternity than go out in the world to 
				embrace members of other faiths.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:150%" align="justify">
				<font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It appears then 
				that the ideology of ‘Islamist’ terrorism cannot be fought with 
				ideas derived from literal Islam itself. Fighting terrorism will 
				require the use of ideas from beyond the area of pure faith and 
				belief. The history of Islam is certainly not devoid of thinkers 
				who did go far beyond that area.</span></font></p>
