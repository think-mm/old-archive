	For Truth by Aroj Ali Matubbar</a></i></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With his scraggly beard, the dark, gaunt man, clad 
	in rumpled punjabi and pyjama, a fountain pen sticking out of his breast 
	pocket, could very well be a teacher of Islamic education at the village <i>
	maktab</i>; his roughly hewn, sunburnt face, would place him in any number 
	of other rural callings. But Aroj Ali Matubbor, primarily a farmer who had 
	done stints as a land surveyor, was no ordinary villager. Behind that rustic 
	exterior lay an extraordinary intellect and a remarkable human being. He is 
	barely known in his own country, except among a handful of liberal 
	intellectuals. This is unsurprising in a society that is not overly fond of 
	people who ask awkward questions on matters of faith --matters thought to 
	have been settled for eternity. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The man probably loved nothing better than to ask 
	why. It is unclear where he got that often discomfiting habit from, but a 
	tragedy in his adolescent years must have turned him on. His mother had died 
	and an all too human desire to preserve her memory led him to have her 
	photographed before the burial. This, the religious leaders of the village 
	community declared, was a great sin for which there was no requital. They 
	therefore refused to perform the <i>janaza</i>, the obligatory 
	congregational prayer for a Muslim deceased before his or her burial. Why? 
	Aroj Ali asked. Why should his mother, a devout Muslim, be deprived of the 
	last prayer that was her due? His entreaties were in vain. His mother was 
	buried without the <i>janaza</i>.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In other circumstances and places, the matter 
	would probably have been resolved and his mother would have been given the 
	customary <i>janaza</i>. But the incident was real enough for Aroj Ali. And 
	he soon realized what happened to his dead mother was only a small 
	reflection of the irrationality and obscurantism that pervaded the society. 
	The custodians of religion in his native village never answered the 
	agonizing question he asked. That did not prevent him from asking some more 
	questions. In fact, his propensity to inquire grew and spread. As he put it, 
	“ For eighteen long years after my mother’s death, I strove hard to melt 
	down certain blind religious beliefs with the heat of philosophy,&nbsp; poured 
	the contents in the mould of science, and came up with a list of questions”. 
	These question were later elaborated in his “In the Quest for Truth”, his 
	most important little work. His questioning was often met with hostility: he 
	was summoned before a court of law, the publication of his book was 
	prohibited, and he was threatened with physical violence. But, the rebel 
	that he was, he went on asking questions.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The range of his inquiry was large. On the other 
	had, the man never seemed to worry about finessing the formulation of his 
	inquiry, or of its results, with the intellectual sophistication that comes 
	naturally to philosophers of the same genre as his -- &nbsp;the 
	rationalist-humanists of the west. He was more interested in spelling out 
	some truths, including home truths, and cared little about a label for his 
	thinking. And you could smell rural Bangladesh, his home and audience, in 
	much of what he expounded. Consider the metaphor he uses: “Just as a hungry 
	ox tears his tether and gorges himself on crops growing on other’s land, so 
	does the mind of man transcend the bounds of religion and rush to philosophy 
	and science to relieve its hunger.” One only wishes the Bengali propensity 
	to reason and inquire were as strong as that.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The themes that his critical mind probes range 
	from simple religious beliefs to biology and the theory of evolution, to 
	notions of creationism, to physics and astronomy.&nbsp; It is, however, religious 
	concepts and believes that occupies him the most. Is it true, for example, 
	he asks, &nbsp;that the land as well as human effort in Bangladesh is less 
	fruitful today than before– there was less <i>barkat</i>, in parlance of 
	ignorance – because people do not any longer have&nbsp; religious faith, or <i>
	iman</i> ? &nbsp;If the answer is yes, as many ‘God-fearing’ people believe it 
	is, one needs to ask why then nations who have no <i>iman</i> at all, the 
	infidels, are far more productive? Or, if it is true that a particular angel 
	of God has been assigned to control the wind and the rain, why then do 
	cyclones ravage Chittagong, mostly inhabited by Muslims, and never Varanasi, 
	which is almost entirely Hindu? Had Aroj Ali lived today he would have asked 
	how was it that the recent Asian tsunami wreaked havoc mostly in the Aceh 
	province of Indonesia, which was almost entirely Muslim, and home to 
	resurgent Islamic fundamentalism? </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These are hardly teasers. They deserve serious 
	consideration because they touch what Aroj Ali considers the heart of the 
	matter: these beliefs and notions fails the test of reason. He does not 
	flinch from extending the test to beliefs far more fundamental to religion. 
	These include questions as diverse as the nature of being of God; what 
	distinguishes Him from humans; the nature of His will; His kindness; Heaven 
	and Hell; &nbsp;predestination; the duties of the angels; the ascent (the <i>
	meraj</i> ) of the Prophet Muhammad (SM) to the high heavens to meet with 
	God; the supposed virtue in slaughter of animals; and a host of other ideas. 
	It appears that there are no sacred cows in his scheme of thinking.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shows how orthodox thinking falls short of a 
	good answer to the questions he raises; it is also ridded with 
	contradictions. To pick a few examples: in Islam, as in other religions, God 
	has so shape or form. The non-corporal nature God makes it impossible for 
	Him to sit or stand in the sense in which we use those words. Yet, in the 
	holy books He is sometimes depicted as one sitting on his throne. How is one 
	to reconcile the two irreconcilables? &nbsp;I am not sure whether Aroj Ali was 
	aware of the following riposte to that question by Malik Ibn Anas, founder 
	of the Maliki school of Islamic thought: “The sitting [God’s] is well-known, 
	its modality is unknown, belief in it is obligatory and questioning it is a 
	heresy”. But he was well aware of the broad argument, which has been 
	repeated many times, and which of course has nothing to do with reason. 
	Similarly, he asks, if God is omnipresent, why was it necessary for the 
	Prophet to ascend the high heavens to meet with Him?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The critical questions that Aroj Ali often raises 
	on certain facets of religion are not meant to mock or “hurt the religious 
	sentiments of pious Muslims”, the kind of allegation that has largely been 
	responsible for a lack of critical thinking on religion. He is only calling 
	for honest answers to what he considers legitimate questions. He also takes 
	a critical view of received wisdom in other religions, making forays into 
	the tale of Bhagwan Indra, the&nbsp; Ramayanic tale of the struggle between Rama 
	and &nbsp;Ravana , where he unreservedly sides with the latter, and the mythology 
	of gods in various religions. And he examines issues picked from religious 
	beliefs with the same instrument of logic and reason as when he discusses 
	what causes tides or lightning and thunder, always juxtaposing the 
	scientific reasons behind natural phenomena and popular notions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Neither does his critical examination of religious 
	beliefs distract him from the social ills of his time. His brief discussion 
	on <i>hila </i>marriage brings out the innate social injustice of the system 
	that is weighed heavily against women. His discussions on baseless popular 
	religious notions are often motivated by an urge to rid society of 
	superstitions that have hindered social and economic progress.<i> </i>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Born in a remote village of Barisal to a poor 
	farming family, Aroj ali had no formal education. A self-taught man, he 
	bought books whenever he could and begged and borrowed them when he could 
	not. The spirit of inquiry led him to read everything he could lay his hands 
	on. A tremendous thirst for knowledge drove him, and that too in a society 
	where book learning is a privilege of a few, and hankering after the truth 
	is limited to fewer still. It was therefore a fitting that he donated just 
	about all he owned at the end of his life to build a public library in his 
	village. Characteristically, he declared: “In my view, a library is far 
	superior to a <i>mandir</i>, a mosque or a church”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aroj Ali proved by his art of living that it is 
	quite possible for an individual to live an honest life without necessarily 
	having to bind oneself with the trappings of ritual dominated faith. He was 
	a totally honest man as well as a self-made one. His dealings with fellow 
	human beings in financial matters were above reproach. But his honesty 
	extended well beyond that. In the final analysis, I believe his honesty lay 
	in the utter congruity between how he reasoned and how he lived.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the matter of his own death too he strove for a 
	rare consistency of reasoning. The thought of death rarely fails to 
	concentrate the mind. Its approach would also enfeeble the thinking in the 
	most rational of individuals. Not so with Aroj Ali. He donated his corpse to 
	Barisal Medical College. He also gave his reasoning, which was primarily 
	that the body would be useful to the college as a teaching institution, 
	while, in any case, it was unlikely to receive much respect from the 
	religious establishment, if it were to be buried.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aroj Ali Matubbor died nineteen years ago this 
	month. Sadly, the forces of obscurantism that he was so ready to battle, 
	have only gained in strength in our society over these many years. In his 
	last will and testament there was a small wish: that his death anniversary 
	be commemorated, humbly, with expenses met from the tiny trust fund he had 
	set up. We ourselves do not need to be humble about it.</font></p>
