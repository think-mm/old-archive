                <font face="Verdana">It has been three weeks since violence 
                started in the Islamic world in wake of the publication of 
                cartoons satirizing the Prophet Muhammad in the Danish newspaper 
                Jyllands-Posten. It began with Palestinians burning Danish 
                flags, rose to a crescendo in Beirut, and reached what might be 
                called fever pitch in Afghanistan. In the latter country a 
                number of people were killed in the violence. In Pakistan, for 
                some inexplicable reason, Islamists took up the cudgel in 
                defence of the honour of the Prophet of Islam rather late in the 
                chain on events. As if to compensate for this, the violence in 
                that country has perhaps been the most widespread and has left a 
                number of people dead. People seemed to have gone berserk in 
                many places of the Islamic world, even though there have also 
                been appeals for restraint.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
  The world seemed riveted to these scenes of rage. Newspapers carried the news 
  day after day as did television channels; pundits came up with analyses of the 
  causes of the trouble: and Muslims in general talked about nothing else. 
  People with long memories will find this preoccupation with the prophetic 
  cartoon a bit puzzling. This has not been the first time Muslim “sentiments” 
  have been hurt by supposed insults to Islam and its prophet. The theft of a 
  lock of hair that was supposed to have belonged to Prophet Muhammad from a 
  shrine in Kashmir lead to violent protests not only in that state but in 
  various places in Pakistan. In Bangladesh, a manufacturer’s emblem on shoes 
  that looked (if my memory serves me) like Arabic calligraphy of the word Allah 
  led Islamists to stage violent street demonstrations, leading to the shutting 
  down of the shoe factory. In India a mere naming of a character Muhammad in a 
  novel led to violence.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
  I have no intention of belittling the events surrounding the publication of 
  the Muhammad cartoons. It is only right that their nature and significance 
  should be fully investigated without fear or apology. But such events tend to 
  have the unfortunate consequence of sidetracking some of the more enduring 
  issues concerning Islam in the modern world. It can lead one to lower his 
  guard against the ever present threat of Islamist extremism. Let me explain.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
  Just over a week ago several websites run by secular critics of Islam received 
  death threats from a shadowy Islamist group. The threat was issued on the 
  internet and was directed against a number of well-known critics of Islam who 
  have written extensively on these websites. These writers were named and a 
  “Death Warrant” was issued for their “blasphemous publications against Allah (SWT) 
  and His most honoured prophet Muhammad (SAW)”. The group, calling itself 
  “International Organisation in the defence of Allah &amp; the Prophet Muhammad, 
  Peace Be Upon Him”, cites verses of the Koran to support their conviction that 
  “[the secularists’] blood has now become lawful to spill…”</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
  Just about the same time when the threat on the internet was issued, a group 
  of Islamists in the west coast of the United States circulated leaflets 
  “condemning” to death a number of these critics of Islam. The leaflet says, 
  according to my informant, that it has become incumbent for the fighters of 
  Islam to soak their hands in the apostates’ blood.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
  It is unnecessary and futile here to go into the grounds used by these 
  jihadists for their decision to issue the fatwa. Note here only the apparent 
  stupidity of the “Organisation in the Defence of Allah … ” in quoting Koranic 
  verses II:190-195 which were directed against unbelievers who were in armed 
  struggle against the Muslims in the seventh century. The relevant verses, let 
  me suggest to them, should have been something like verse IV: 89, which deals 
  with renegades. The other face of their fatuity is their declared intention to 
  defend Allah against His critics, as if Allah needs their defence, or anybody 
  else’s. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
  Of immediate importance, of course, is the threat itself. Here are a group 
  people who have taken upon themselves the duty to defend their God and Prophet 
  by killing fellow human beings whose thinking is different from theirs. And 
  the threat is directed against people who live in a free country like the 
  United States of America that guarantees full freedom of belief and expression 
  and where a threat like this is a criminal offence. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
  We should consider the threat directed against a handful of free thinkers a 
  far more significant event than the whole sorry cartoon saga. It is therefore 
  amazing that the news of the “death warrant” has been met with such deafening 
  silence. Not a single line of protest has, to my knowledge, been written or 
  even posted on the internet, to which discussions of issues of Islamic 
  fundamentalism and obscurantism has so far been largely confined. Equally 
  disturbing is the actual shutting down of one of the secularist websites that 
  have come under threat.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><br>
  The fledgling tradition of critical thinking on religion, particularly Islam, 
  is in grave danger if protest against such threat to it is not heard loud and 
  clear. Let us protest. Let us follow it up with practical action under the law 
  of the land against such heinous efforts to silence the voice of reason.
