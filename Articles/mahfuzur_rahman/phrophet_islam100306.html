				<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among Muslims the predominant response 
				to the recent pillorying of the Prophet of Islam in a Danish 
				newspaper has been one of anger. Even where anger did not turn 
				into frenzy and mayhem, there was bitterness, a feeling that the 
				west has unfairly treated Muslim sensibilities in the name of 
				freedom of expression. It will be wrong, however, to think that 
				Muslim thinking been nearly as monolithic as that: some Muslims 
				must have been torn between their respect for their Prophet and 
				that for the freedom the modern world has endowed on them. 
				Others have called for restraint and equanimity. Among the 
				latter are those who have asked fellow Muslims to follow the 
				example of the Prophet in particular in their show of tolerance 
				to acts of provocation.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A recent article by Ibrahim Hooper, a well-known 
	member of the Council on American -Islamic Relations (CAIR), pleads 
	precisely for this course of action. This is undoubtedly a noble gesture. 
	Nevertheless, it is essential to look a little more closely at the plea and 
	its historical background. I intend to do this in the following paragraphs. 
	It will be seen the conclusion that emerges is substantially different from, 
	and far more complex than, the one presented in the CAIR article. Following 
	the Prophetic examples cited can indeed be an act of piety; but there are 
	other examples which will not serve the cause of kindness and tolerance 
	towards fellow human beings. The verses from the Koran cited in the article 
	are also selective and quotations that convey very different impressions are 
	easy to find. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CAIR article points out that the “The Islamic 
	traditions include a number of instances of the prophet having the 
	opportunity to strike back at those who attacked him, but refrained from 
	doing so.” One need not doubt that there were such instances. Neither can 
	one ignore the following historical facts.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The killing of Ka’b bin Ashraf, the poet:&nbsp; <i>
	Sahih Al-Bukhari</i> states “ Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah, (ra): Allah’s 
	Messenger (pbuh) said: “ Who will kill Ka’b bin Al-Ashraf who has hurt Allah 
	and His Messenger? Thereupon Muhammad bin Maslama got up saying, &nbsp;“O Allah’s 
	Messenger! Would you like that I kill him?” The Prophet (pbuh) said, 
	“Yes””&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">[<i>Sahih Al-Bukhari</i>,&nbsp; Translation by Dr. Muhammad 
	Muhsin Khan, Darussalam Publishers and Distributors, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 
	Vol. 5, pp. 221-223.] The long <i>hadith</i> then narrates how the assassins 
	set out on their mission, the subterfuge they used to coax the poet out of 
	his house, and killed him. Ibn Ishaq [ <i>Sirat Rasul Allah</i>, English 
	translation by A. Guillaume entitled <i>Life of Muhammad</i>, Oxford 
	University Press, Karachi, 1967, pp.367-368] tells the same story in gory 
	detail, and narrates how the Prophet accompanied the assassins part of the 
	way on their mission and how he received them after it was accomplished.. 
	This was perhaps the first political assassination in Islamic history, 
	though certainly not in the history of mankind. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The killing of Abu Rafi, the Jew: <i>Sahih 
	Al-Bukhari</i> states: “ Narrated Al-Bara’ bin Azib (ra): Allah’s Messenger 
	(pbuh) sent some men from the <i>Ansar</i> to(kill) the Jew Abu Rafi, and 
	appointed Abdullah bin Atik as their leader. Abu Rafi used to hurt Allah’s&nbsp; 
	messenger (pbuh) and help his enemies against him…” Here again is a long <i>
	hadith</i> that describes in considerable detail how the assassins got into 
	Abu Rafi’s palace and killed him. The actual killing was done by Abdullah 
	bin Atik who narrates the gruesome detail of the murder: “ …I dove the point 
	of the sword into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his 
	back, and I realised that I have killed him.” Incidentally, while escaping 
	after the murder, he broke his leg in a fall. As he reported the 
	accomplishment of the mission, the Prophet saw the broken leg and instantly 
	healed it. &nbsp;[<i>Ibid</i>. 223-225]<u> </u></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;While Ibrahim Hooper’s citation of instances of 
	the Prophet (pbuh)’s dealings with fellow human beings paints a picture of 
	kindness and forgiveness, these the two murders, ordered by the Prophet 
	(pbuh), and reported in authentic <i>hadith</i>, certainly throw a very 
	different light on the subject. Such examples to the contrary are, 
	furthermore, not rare. Two more examples should suffice here, also both 
	taken from <i>Sahih Al-Bukhari</i>.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corpses of Quraish leaders thrown into a pit: &nbsp;“ 
	Narrated Abu Talha (ra): On the the day ( of the battle ) of Badr, the 
	Prophet (pbuh) ordered that the corpses of twenty-four leaders of Quraish 
	should be thrown into one of the dirty dry wells of Badr…..So, on the third 
	day of the battle of Badr, he ordered that his she -camel be saddled, then 
	he set out, and his Companions followed him saying among themselves, 
	“Definitely he (i.e. the Prophet (pbuh) is proceeding for some great 
	purpose. When he (pbuh) halted at the edge of the well, he addressed the 
	corpses of the Quraish infidels by their names and their fathers’ names, “O 
	so-and-so, son of so-and-so, and O so-and-so, son of so-and-so! Would it 
	have pleased you if you had obeyed Allah and His Messenger? …. ‘Umar said, 
	“O Allah’s Messenger! You are speaking to bodies that have no souls!” 
	Allah’s Messenger (pbuh) said, “By Him in whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is, you 
	do not hear, what I say better than they do.” Qatada said, Allah brought 
	them to life (again) to let them hear him (i.e. the Prophet (pbuh)) to 
	reprimand them and slight them and take revenge over them and caused them to 
	feel remorseful and regretful.” ” [Ibid. pp. 188-189]</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It may well have been that throwing corpses of 
	people killed in battle into dry wells was among the prevailing customs in 
	Arab societies. But this does not make the episode of the dead Quraish 
	leaders being flung into wells in revenge any more merciful, especially when 
	this is juxtaposed against a general hypothesis of mercy on the part of the 
	Prophet of Islam (pbuh). Similarly, cruel punishment for crime may have been 
	the order of the day, but the following example, also from <i>Sahih 
	Al-Bukhari</i>, of punishment meted out by the Prophet (pbuh) himself does 
	stand out.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Narrated Anas (ra): The climate of Al-Madina did 
	not suit some people, so the Prophet (pbuh) ordered them to proceed along 
	with his shepherd, i.e. his camels, and drink their milk and urine (as a 
	medicine). So they proceeded along with the shepherd (and the camels) and 
	drank their milk and urine, till their bodies became healthy. Then they 
	killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When the news reached the 
	Prophet (pbuh), he sent some people in their pursuit. When they were 
	brought, he cut their hands and feet, and their eyes were branded with 
	heated pieces of iron.” [Ibid. vol. 7, p. 329.]</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Humanity, mercy and forgiveness have often been 
	trodden into blood- soaked earth in&nbsp; the course of the history of the human 
	race. No nation or religion, or rather its adherents, can claim to have a 
	squeaky clean record here. Islam is no exception.&nbsp; With that background in 
	mind, it is useful to recount here the historical fact of the massacre of 
	Banu Quraiza for those who look at Prophetic action as an exemplar of Muslim 
	behaviour today. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after the Battle of the Trench in the year 
	627CE/ 5AH, the Jewish tribe of Banu Quraiza was by besieged Prophet 
	Muhammad’s forces for their alleged support for the Muslim’s enemies, the 
	Quraish. The historical reasons for the attack on Banu Qurayza are a matter 
	of controversy. What is not is the gruesomeness and scale of the retribution 
	inflicted on the tribe. Ibn Ishaq describes the scene thus: “Then they [ 
	Banu Qurayza] surrendered, and the apostle confined them in Medina in the 
	quarter of d. al-Harith, a woman of B. al-Najjar. Then the apostle went out 
	to the market of Medina (which is still its market today) and dug trenches 
	in it. Then he sent for them [the male members of the tribe] and struck off 
	their heads in those trenches as they were brought out to him in batches. 
	Among them was the enemy of Allah Huyayy b. Akhtab and Ka’b b. Asad their 
	chief. There were some 600 or 700 in all, though some put the figure as high 
	as 800 or 900. As they were being taken out in batches to the apostle they 
	asked Ka’b what he thought would be done with them. He replied, ‘will you 
	never understand? Don’t you see that the summoner never stops and those who 
	are taken away do not return? By Allah it is death!’ This went on until the 
	apostle made an end of them.” [<i>Ibid </i>p. 464.] The women and children 
	of the tribe were spared death and were taken into slavery. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One need not doubt acts of kindness on the part of 
	the Prophet of Islam in his private life. But asking Muslims to emulate him 
	in the hope of making them more tolerant human beings in the modern world is 
	also tantamount to asking them to turn a blind eye to the above acts of 
	horrendous cruelty. There must be other ways to promote tolerance and mercy. 
	We shall return to this shortly, but first we need to take a brief look at 
	some of the quotations from the Koran that the CAIR article uses to 
	underline Islam’s image of tolerance and peace. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article quotes a few verses of the Koran 
	suggesting divine counsel to the Prophet to avoid confrontation with the 
	unbelievers and refrain from using force in his mission to spread Islam. In 
	fact the article could have quoted many more to that effect. There are 
	numerous verses where the Prophet is comforted and reminded that his duty is 
	only to warn, that he is not the arbiter of their affairs and so on. Thus: 
	“Say, ‘Not mine is the responsibility for arranging your affairs’ “ ( VI: 
	66);&nbsp; “ Say, ‘ I am not here to watch over your doings’” (VI:104); “So leave 
	them and their inventions alone” ( VI: 112);&nbsp; “Say, &nbsp;‘My work to me, and 
	your to you’” (X:41);&nbsp; “ Will thou then compel mankind against their will to 
	believe?” (X: 99);&nbsp; “ But if they turn away, thy duty is only to preach the 
	clear Message” (XVI:82); “And thou art not the dispenser of their affairs” ( 
	XLII:6); &nbsp;“Thou art not one to overawe them by force” ( L:45); or, perhaps 
	the best-known of them, “ [Say] ‘ To you be your Way, and to me mine’” 
	(CIX:6). </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These verses and, many others in the Koran, would 
	give the impression of tolerant Islam, which totally rejects force in the 
	matter of religion. It is important to note, however, that a large majority 
	of the verses were Meccan, from a period when the nascent religion was weak 
	and was struggling to survive in a largely hostile social and political 
	environment. It is unhelpful to hark back to verses of that period as 
	representative of the true spirit of Islam, to the exclusion of other 
	verses. The mood in the Koran changed dramatically when Islam began to 
	thrive in Medina and started to assert itself. Much of the Meccan tolerance 
	was gone.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other difficulties with selective 
	quoting from the Koran for the purpose of making a case for tolerance and 
	forgiveness, as the CAIR article seeks to do. A very large number of 
	examples can be cited to illustrate the difficulties. For the present let us 
	consider the oft-quoted verse: “Let there be no compulsion in religion: the 
	truth stands out clear from error” (II: 256).The verse has often been cited 
	by Islamic moderates as a clear example of Koran’s emphasis on moderation 
	and tolerance. That it belongs to a Medina <i>sura</i> (<i>Baqara</i>) is 
	probably supposed to add to its importance. But, apart from the 
	consideration that such verses are relatively rare in Medina <i>suras</i>, 
	there are major differences of opinion on the implication of the verse 
	itself. The interpretation preferred by the moderates is not the only one 
	available. There are very different ways of looking at the verse. The 
	following is one.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A well-known Bengali translation of the Koran and 
	commentary by Maulana Muhiuddin Khan (original by Maulana Mufti Muhammad 
	Shafi, published from Saudi Arabia) contends that that the verse does not 
	have anything to do with violence against unbelievers, but goes on to say: 
	“Reading this <i>ayat,</i> some might ask: this suggests that no force 
	should be applied in matters of religion, whereas Islam has taught us to 
	conduct <i>jihad </i>and fight. Deep reflection should suggest that such a 
	question is not an appropriate one. That is because in Islam the lesson of
	<i>jihad</i> and <i>qetal</i> [i.e. fighting or killing] is not aimed at 
	compelling people to believe. If that were the case, there would be no need 
	for <i>kafirs</i> to take their own responsibility in exchange for <i>
	jizyia.</i>” The commentator goes on to say: Islam “also prohibits the 
	killing of persons who have begun to pay the <i>jizyia</i> and obey 
	[Islamic] laws.” He&nbsp; points out that&nbsp; since Allah has asked that tumult and 
	oppression (<i>fitna</i> in Arabic) perpetrated by the <i>kafirs </i>be rid 
	of through <i>jihad</i> and <i>qetal</i>, “ killing of transgressing 
	oppressors [ meaning the <i>kafirs</i>] is like killing snakes or scorpions 
	or some such animals that cause pain” (Translations mine.) With 
	transgression presumably to be judged from the point of view of the Muslims 
	alone, and with the <i>kafirs</i> being able to save their skin only on 
	payment of <i>jizyia</i>, this line of argument revolving around the verse 
	hardly gives one the impression of tolerance in the ordinary meaning of the 
	term that the moderates would prefer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are indeed numerous verses of the Koran which 
	admit of different and even conflicting interpretations or do not mean what 
	they apparently says, making the practice of referring to them quite 
	hazardous. It is neither practical nor useful to try a comprehensive survey 
	of such verses here. But let us take quick a look at a verse that the CAIR 
	article cites: “ When ( the righteous) hear vain talk, they withdraw from it 
	saying : ‘Our deeds are for us and yours for you: peace be on you….” XXVIII: 
	55( Meccan <i>sura</i>). &nbsp;Does the verse really mean “Peace be on you, 
	unbelievers”? No, according to some commentators. There is a remarkably 
	similar verse in another Meccan <i>sura</i>:&nbsp; “But turn away from them, and 
	say “Peace”!...” ( XLIII: 89) The Maulana Muhiuddin Khan translation and 
	commentary has this to say:&nbsp; “‘say <i>Salam</i>’ does not mean &nbsp;“<i>Salam</i>-
	<i>alaikum</i>”( Peace be on you), because it is not permissible to address 
	a non-Muslim in that language”, meaning &nbsp;that the language is reserved for 
	Muslims only. It only means “I want to sever connection with you nicely”. 
	While this suggests a degree of tolerance, it does not extend to amity even 
	in a Meccan sura, and the meaning of the verse turns out to be different 
	from what it apparently says.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are pieces in the Koran that prescribe 
	kindness and courtesy. In a remarkable verse it says: “When a (courteous) 
	greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous or (at 
	least) of equal courtesy…” ( IV:86). Apparently there is no requirement in 
	the holy book to extend such courtesy to the unbelievers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In much of the Medina <i>suras,</i> peace with the 
	unbelievers was to be had only on Islam’s terms. Perhaps the final word on 
	this is suggested by: “Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day, 
	nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by God and His Apostle, 
	nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth, ( even if they are) of the People of 
	the Book, until they pay the <i>Jizya </i>with willing submission, and feel 
	themselves subdued” ( <i>Sura Tauba</i>, IX:29) (Yusuf Ali’s translation). 
	This was among the last suras to be revealed, lending weight to the finality 
	of its pronouncement on <i>Jihad</i> in the Koran.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One would find many instances in the Koran where 
	God is presented as a forgiving Being. And this has often been offered as 
	evidence of God’s mercy to all mankind. It is none the less undeniable that 
	such mercy is available only to the believers. The unbelievers, who take 
	others as partners, are doomed for eternity. Any suggestion that unbelievers 
	could conceivably be brought close to the believers in a fraternal relation 
	is shattered by verses like the following: “For the worst of beasts in the 
	sight of God are those who reject Him….”&nbsp; (VIII:55)</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This rather long discussion suggests the apparent 
	futility of seeking support for the case for tolerance and understanding, 
	between Muslims and members of other faiths, in the Koran and the character 
	and dealings of the Prophet of Islam. In fact Islam, or any other religion, 
	is not about brotherly love towards those who reject it. One can even argue 
	that otherwise there would not be a <i>raison d’être</i> for any religion. 
	The source of understanding between people of different faiths must be 
	sought elsewhere.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is tempting to stop right there. But that would 
	be a pity. Prophets of other faiths, big and small, have often been 
	pilloried. Rarely in modern times has this led to violent protests from the 
	adherents of the faith in question. In the days following the publication of 
	the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, I came to contrast the violence 
	provoked by it to the total absence of&nbsp; such reaction when another Prophet 
	of another great religion was shown in very unsavoury light in a literary 
	work. Dan Brown’s novel <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, which has sold tens of 
	millions of copies, centres around the story of Jesus Christ, far from going 
	to heaven after his crucifixion, going off with Mary Magdalene, travelling 
	to Europe and raising a family. It will, I believe, be recognized that to 
	the Christians this depiction of their Prophet is potentially a far more 
	shocking matter than the cartoons of the Prophet of Islam to the Muslims. 
	How did the Christians react to it? Not with violence, not even with a loud 
	protest. And where did the mainstream Christians learn such tolerance? They 
	learned it from a secular liberal tradition. Muslims should follow that 
	example, rather than waste time in futile search for it their holy books and 
	prophetic traditions.</font></p>
