				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are few areas of 
				religious faith where heterodoxy is as roundly condemned as in 
				the mainstream of Islam. Intolerance to dissent runs through 
				every organized religion. No religious establishment relishes 
				criticism of the basic tenets of its faith. Excommunication is 
				still a potential deterrent to unorthodox behavior in Christian 
				churches. Rarely, however, does criticism of orthodoxy in 
				Christianity provoke threat of violence towards even the most 
				strident dissident. Modern Hindu liberals often disparage their 
				gods and goddesses and jokes about some members of the Hindu 
				pantheon are common among the members of the faith. Bengali 
				literature is replete with flippancy and irreverence towards the 
				pantheon. Criticism and even disparagement are made with 
				impunity. In Christianity occasional irreverence, some of it 
				intemperate, to Jesus Christ is generally met with shock and 
				indignation but hardly, if ever, with threat of physical 
				violence against the non-conformist. Serious or scholarly 
				criticism of its tenets and beliefs rarely provokes anger and 
				practically never violence. </font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not so in Islam. 
				Discourses are permitted so long as they are grounded in piety 
				and propagation of the faith. Indeed they abound in Muslim 
				societies and many Muslims would rather have more of the same, 
				not less. But Muslims in general tend to be far more hostile to 
				all shades of criticism of their religion or heritage than 
				members of other faiths are towards theirs. The hostility is not 
				limited to critics from other faiths, but extends to Muslim 
				detractors of the faith. In fact, the hostility to the latter is 
				more widespread than the other variety. This is partly because 
				people of other faiths nowadays rarely have time to criticize 
				Islam, except insofar as it can be linked to modern terrorism, 
				or any other religion for that matter, though it is easy to find 
				rabid exceptions. The other reason is that, with the advance of 
				rational and secularist thinking, there is now a growing number 
				of critics from among their co-religionists themselves. The 
				number of these critics is still very small and their criticism 
				is still mostly confined to the relative safety of internet 
				websites. On the other hand, the rise of strident Islamic 
				fundamentalism has been accompanied by increased hostility 
				towards critics of Islam. It is important to understand the 
				nature of the hostility of fundamentalist Islam towards anything 
				that smacks of criticism of the faith. It is perhaps even more 
				significant that most Muslims, including many moderates, share 
				the hostility. </font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The traditionalist's 
				objection to criticism of Islam falls roughly into two 
				categories, both potentially contentious. First, the criticism 
				is not grounded in fact. Second, the criticism hurts the 
				&quot;religious sensibilities&quot; of pious Muslims. The two categories 
				are of course not unrelated. The first type of objection sounds 
				eminently reasonable. After all, the critics are generally the 
				ones who profess to uphold &quot;facts&quot; -- as against imagination or 
				pure notion. But, as in many other walks of life, &quot;facts&quot; that 
				support the critic's points of view may also be readily 
				available. The question then boils down to which of the &quot;facts&quot; 
				one puts his trust in. Unfortunately for the traditionalists, 
				the facts presented by the critics are very often culled from 
				the holy books themselves. There are numerous examples and but a 
				few must suffice here. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The recent upsurge in 
				terrorism by the so-called &quot;Islamists&quot; has led to accusations 
				that Islam condones violence. The allegation has produced angry 
				denials from Muslims of various shades who contend that far from 
				being a religion of violence, Islam has always stood for peace. 
				This reaction is worth examining in relation to &quot;facts.&quot; </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are numerous 
				instances in the <i>Qur'an</i> where Muslims have been urged to 
				wage war against the infidels. Some the exhortations to fight 
				are not purely defensive. Verses such as II:193 (&quot;And fight them 
				on until there is no more tumult and oppression, and there 
				prevail justice and faith in God&quot;) or VIII:39, which virtually 
				repeats verse II:193, are cases in point. Verse IX:5 calls on 
				Muslims to fight the infidels, to &quot;seize them, beleaguer them, 
				and lie in wait for them in every stratagem&quot; until they &quot;repent 
				and establish regular prayers and practice regular charity.&quot; 
				(The translations are from Abdullah Yusuf Ali's celebrated The 
				Meaning of the Holy Qur'an.) These and other verses make peace 
				with the infidels attainable only on Islam's terms. No serious 
				Muslim denies the authenticity of these verses or their 
				practical significance. In other words, those who contend that 
				Islam condones violence can say that they are only referring to 
				&quot;facts. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is entirely possible 
				that the violence apparently sanctioned in the <i>Qur'an</i> 
				would at least look understandable in certain historical 
				context, particularly when many societies, and not just Muslims, 
				were prone to violence. Yet traditionalist Muslims generally 
				take great umbrage to any mention of these verses as examples of 
				violence sanctioned in Islam. Instead of explaining the 
				historical contexts of the verses, and stressing how changed 
				circumstances should put a new gloss on their meaning, and 
				engaging the critics in a dialogue, they consider any such 
				criticism as intolerable affront to Islam. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly, the history 
				of Muslim societies, like that of many other mediaeval 
				societies, is replete with violence. Critics often cite the 
				cruelty of the slaughter of the Jewish tribe of Bani Quraiza, 
				especially because of its non-combatant status. Between 700 and 
				900 male members of the tribe were beheaded in a single day for 
				their alleged treachery after the tribe had surrendered to the 
				Muslims. The circumstances leading to the slaughter is often a 
				matter of debate, but the fact of the massacre is not in 
				dispute. Neither was officially sanctioned political 
				assassination unknown even in the Prophet (SM)'s time. <i>Sahih 
				ahadith</i> can be cited to attest to these facts. Nevertheless, 
				mention of such facts from the very sources which mainstream 
				Muslims themselves respect and accept often tests the limits to 
				freedom to talk about Islam. </font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are, however, also 
				a wide range of subjects which are unrelated to factuality but 
				are variously connected to faith where freedom to talk about 
				Islam is severely limited, perhaps more so. While reference to 
				uncomfortable facts might produce ire among traditionalist 
				Muslims, any critical probe into faith-based issues is viewed as 
				an insult to Islam and is often taboo. Much of what is 
				frequently treated as assault on the religious sensibilities of 
				ordinary Muslims has to do not with facts but with faith. It is 
				interesting to note that the Bengali word &quot;Obomanona&quot; -- 
				literally insult -- is almost invariably used with a solemnity 
				fit for the occasion, and is used interchangeably with &quot;hurting 
				the religious sensibilities&quot; of Muslims. </font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a long list of 
				subjects variously linked with faith where critical discussion 
				remains taboo in Islamic societies. It is unclear why faith 
				should be deemed vulnerable to criticism. The expectation should 
				rather be that an individual's religious faith would be strong 
				enough to withstand any attack of hostile ideas. The reality is 
				rather different. Faith is often worn on sleeves and as often 
				easily wounded. A good example of faith being all too easily 
				hurt is the reaction to eating, drinking, or smoking in the 
				presence of those who are fasting in the month of Ramadan, the 
				month of fasting. While not fasting in the month of Ramadan is 
				considered a sin except in extenuating circumstances, the act of 
				eating or drinking or smoking in the presence of one who is 
				fasting in considered an insult to Islam. Islamic societies have 
				dealt with the offenders by punishments that ranged from a mere 
				slap on the wrist to beatings or imprisonment. </font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The &quot;offensive&quot; 
				behaviour of non-fasters in Ramadan is among the lighter 
				infringements of religious mores in Islamic societies. Critical 
				talk about the fundamentals of the faith is considered far more 
				serious an infringement. The list of areas of the faith where 
				the scope for critical talk is strictly limited is long and 
				includes: the nature of divine revelation and the primal origin 
				of the Qur'an; the nature of Allah, the Supreme Being; the 
				nature and consistency of Qur'anic directives; and the apparent 
				duality between predestination and free will in divine texts. 
				The Prophet of Islam, like all prophets, similarly assumes a 
				mantle of divinity and hence is off limits to appraisal as a 
				human being, even an extraordinary one, which undoubtedly he 
				was. Here, though, the traditionalist interpretations of &quot;fact&quot; 
				and faith got inextricably mixed and the result has been a 
				formidable opposition among mainstream Muslims to any attempt at 
				critical examination of either. </font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In passing, note that 
				there cannot be an absolute standard by which &quot;sensibilities&quot; 
				can be weighed and the moral high ground often claimed by those 
				whose sensibilities are said to have been hurt by secular 
				criticism can itself be quite vulnerable. There are for example, 
				numerous exegeses of divine texts by their fundamentalist 
				interpreters which can hurt the sensibilities of a modern man, 
				even those of a modern Muslim. Thus, those who complain about 
				critics of Islam hurting their sensibilities may themselves be 
				hurting the sensibilities of others. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not that there was 
				never any critical examination of some of the basic tenets of 
				Islam. The <i>Mu'tazila</i> who, in the eighth and ninth 
				centuries, held sway over Islamic thinking, did think that one 
				could use reason, in contrast with pure faith, to prove the 
				existence of God, and that the Qur'an was not coeval with God 
				but was created, a concept that was anathema to traditional 
				Islamic thinking, and remains so. Other than the central role of 
				reason in their scheme, perhaps their most important legacy has 
				been emphasis on free will and the individual's responsibility 
				for his action. This is indeed critical stuff. They also argued 
				that not only is the sinner responsible for his sins, but God is 
				obliged to punish him. Incidentally, the latter requirement on 
				the part of God also put the <i>Mu'tazila</i> at loggerheads 
				with the traditionalists who considered this as something that 
				robbed the Almighty of his power of pardon. The contribution of 
				the <i>Mu'tazila</i> to critical Islamic thinking should not, 
				however, be exaggerated. Not only were they not free thinkers in 
				the modern sense, mainstream Islam was thoroughly cleansed of 
				their influence by arch traditionalists like al-Ghazali. </font>
				</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">More than ten centuries 
				have passed since the last blip of the <i>Mu'tazila</i>'s 
				efforts to bring reason to bear on religion and it has been over 
				fourteen centuries since Islam arrived on the Arabian peninsula. 
				A tremendous lot has changed in the world since then: the modern 
				man's knowledge of his environment and his ability to overcome 
				hunger and fight disease set him a stellar distance away from 
				his ancestors a millennium and half ago. The primary vehicle of 
				this advance has been his willingness to inquire and reason. His 
				critical spirit has often led him to question ideas and notions 
				derived from tradition and faith. And often inquiry has led to 
				iconoclasm. Yet, amazingly, faith has not vanished from the face 
				of the earth and religion remains as integral to the life of 
				even the most modern of men and women as telephone, air 
				transport, and the internet. Skeptics, agnostics, and atheists 
				have not destroyed Christianity. </font></p>
				<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A large degree of 
				freedom to talk about Islam will not lead to the demise of the 
				religion either. A matter of faith that governs much of life for 
				a billion people is not so easily dismissed. It is also not 
				reasonable to expect or apprehend that mere talk, however 
				critical, would destroy any religious faith worth the name. On 
				the other hand, free and frank discussion of every aspect of the 
				religion should act as a catharsis for fundamentalist Islam: it 
				will purge the system of the dross of obscurantism that has 
				accumulated over the centuries. An uninhibited discourse should 
				lead to greater mutual understanding of the diverse points of 
				view that the modern world represents and can in the long run 
				lead to more tolerant societies. By helping to reinterpret some 
				of the traditional ideas and practices in the light of changed 
				circumstances and directing attention to the plurality of 
				methods for attaining given social and political objectives, it 
				will also turn out to be a potent instrument for fighting 
				&quot;Islamist&quot; terrorism. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this brief space I 
				have pleaded for relaxation of limits to talk about Islam. There 
				are, however, forces at work that make critical talk about the 
				religion already possible. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thanks to modern 
				internet technology, while the print media by and large shuns 
				just about anything critical of any religion, a burgeoning 
				network of websites is taking its place. A wide variety of 
				subjects, ranging from the virulently anti-religious to the 
				extremely pious, are being discussed and debated on the 
				internet. The limits are already beginning to be probed. The
