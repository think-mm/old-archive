				<font face="Verdana">The week of September 17, 2007 was truly 
				remarkable. It will, I believe, remain lodged in the nation’s 
				memory for years to come. At least it will in mine. I am talking 
				about the week of the cartoon of the cat.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Monday the weekly supplement <i>Aalpin </i>of 
	the widely circulating Bengali daily <i>Prothom Alo</i> carried a three-part 
	cartoon. &nbsp;I can only describe it here in so many words. I cannot do justice 
	to the cartoon itself. (Even if I could, I suppose any attempt at it will be 
	an infringement of the law, since the cartoon has been banned by the 
	Government) It is not for nothing that a picture is said to be worth a 
	thousand words, though the characters of the cartoon have words of their 
	own, which makes my task easy.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the cartoon, man meets boy. Here is, first, a 
	middle- aged man in <i>lungi</i> and <i>Punjabi</i>, wearing a beard and 
	sporting a skull cap, with a traditional <i>gamchha</i> flung across his 
	left shoulder. A nice looking fellow really, with cherubic eyes that often 
	go with simplicity of the heart. Man confronts boy, also with cherubic eyes, 
	cuddling a cat. Man asks boy (and I use a literal translation): “Boy, what 
	is your name?” “My name is Babu”, replies boy. “You should say ‘Muhammad’ 
	before you say your name,” man admonishes boy. As a follow-up, and probably 
	to test whether his lesson in etiquette had produced the desired result, man 
	asks boy, “What’s your father’s name?” “Muhammad Abu,” boy replies. Happy 
	with the result, man condescends. “What is it you are carrying?” he asks. 
	“Muhammad cat”, pat came the reply.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day all hell broke loose. There rose a 
	loud chorus of protest. What the protesters were protesting about was that 
	by associating the name of the Prophet of Islam with a mere cat the 
	cartoonist had insulted Islam and hurt the “religious sensibilities” of the 
	Muslims. The editor of <i>Prothom Alo</i> promptly issued a statement 
	apologizing for&nbsp;&nbsp; publishing the cartoon which he termed a mistake. To show 
	that he meant what he said, he also fired the cartoonist, the young Arifur 
	Rahman, a talented artist. He also fired the sub-editor in charge of the 
	publication, <i>Aalpin</i>.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matters did not end there. On Tuesday Arifur 
	Rahman was arrested by the police, on charges of “hurting religious 
	sentiments.” There were more protests from religious zealots. The law and 
	information advisor of the caretaker government said that the publication of 
	such a cartoon was nothing less than a conspiracy, though it was not clear 
	what the nature of the conspiracy was or who it was directed at. In order to 
	contain the situation, he met religious leaders who, however, wanted legal 
	action against the editor and the publisher of the newspaper. On Wednesday, 
	September 19, Maulana Motiur Rahman Nizami of the Jamaat-i-Islami called the 
	publication of the cartoon insulting to Islam and said it had hurt the <i>
	Iman</i> of the Muslims. Several Islamic organizations demanded that the 
	publication of <i>Prothom Alo</i> be banned and its editor arrested. 
	Activists of these organizations held demonstrations and burned copied of 
	the newspaper. On their part, several political parties lauded the decision 
	of the editor of the newspaper to withdraw the cartoon, while others, while 
	expressing their ire at the publication, expressed the hope that the 
	newspaper will refrain from publishing such offensive cartoons in the 
	future. On the same day a magistrate sent the cartoonist to jail.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That too did not end the matter. On Thursday, 
	September 20, a bevy of newspaper editors from all shades of journalism 
	issued a statement, after a meeting with the law and information adviser, 
	pleading with the <i>ulema</i> community of the country to accept the 
	apology tendered by the editor of <i>Prothom Alo</i>, urging them to let the 
	matter rest, also in view of action taken by the government, meaning the 
	jailing of the cartoonist. They also rebuked <i>Prothom Alo </i>and warned 
	it against any repetition of such offence. Still the saga dragged on. On the 
	same day, in an unheard of move, the editor of <i>Prothom Alo</i> met with 
	prominent religious leaders, the most prominent of them being the <i>khatib</i> 
	of the Baitul Mukarram mosque, and apologized to them in person. This was no 
	ordinary apology, however. It took the format of a ceremonial <i>tauba</i>, 
	a procedure invoked when a grave sin has been committed. The gesture 
	appeared to work. The <i>khatib</i> called for calm.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Islamist zeal was not so easily calmed.&nbsp; The 
	following day, after the Friday congregation prayer at Baitul Mukarram, 
	hundreds (on some accounts thousands) of&nbsp;&nbsp; Islamists brought out 
	processions, chanting slogans, some which demanded that the editor and 
	publisher of Prothom Alo be hanged and the newspaper itself be banned. Some 
	of these slogans denounced the newspaper and its editor and publisher as 
	Zionist agents. A large group, mainly led by Hizbut Tahrir, among the most 
	miltant Islamist organizations, then began a march towards Prothom Alo 
	offices. These marchers were lathi-charged by the police at several points 
	of the route, wounding dozens, and were finally dispersed. But the fury in 
	the atmosphere was palpable.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As if to make the week truly unique, another 
	newspaper came under fire. The Shaptahik 2000, in its Eid issue published an 
	autobiographical piece by the exiled secularist write Daud Haider that also 
	supposedly hurt the religious sentiments of the Muslims. Government promptly 
	banned the issue, and its editor, too, tendered an apology to the public and 
	withdrew it from circulation, but not before anger at Shaptahik 2000 added 
	to fury at Prothom Alo.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let us stick to the cartoon affair. The 
	implication of what happened that week goes far deeper than the dramatics of 
	the narrative I have given above. It touches the existence of our secular 
	society. And it practical terms it all boils down to a stark fact: this 
	was&nbsp;&nbsp; appeasement of Islamic fundamentalism verging on capitulation.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tendering of a formal apology from the editor 
	of Prothom Alo for the publication of the cartoon was itself uncalled for. 
	But there are precedents for such apology and whether one liked it or not&nbsp; 
	-- I did not and do not – it almost became a standard practice to assuage 
	hurt feelings. This time a new precedence seems to have been created, and a 
	far more dangerous one. This time a respected editor of a major newspaper, 
	which has for so long upheld secularism and liberalism in the country, goes, 
	hat in hand, to the den of religious leaders, formally to tender apology, 
	and that too in the strict Islamic fashion of a <i>tauba</i>. This was not 
	just humility; this was humiliation. The nation’s secular tradition lay 
	prostrate while the Islamists stood ten feet tall. This was no mere 
	symbolism; next time something similar to the cat cartoon happens, perhaps 
	the <i>ulema</i> will demand, and administer, some corporal punishment to 
	the offending editor, meted out in public.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure of the government to stem this turn of 
	events is singular. Should it not have, once the editor had issued the first 
	statement of apology, declared that the matter should stop there and that 
	any attempt to stir up trouble would be quashed? &nbsp;It had the power to do so. 
	Instead, the government dallied, only said it saw evil hands behind the 
	publication of the cartoon, and looked happily on as the editor uttered the
	<i>tauba</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easy to be hard on Matiur Rahman, the editor 
	of Prothom Alo. One should not be.&nbsp; Probably he had no choice. The 
	alternative might have been physical attack on the newspaper’s offices and 
	facilities, which could even have been burnt down. That could have been 
	preempted by timely government action following closely on his first 
	apology. The government appeared to throw him to the wolves instead. Note 
	also that other editors were no heroes either. They sought only appeasement 
	and did not seem to mind the humiliation of their comrade. None of them came 
	forward to say that the cartoon in fact was totally harmless and should not 
	have provoked the reaction it did.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the surge of events swept aside the central 
	issues of the nature of the cartoon and the fundamental the right of an 
	individual to express himself. &nbsp;No less important, it also tended to wipe 
	away from public view the nature of the protests and the protesters.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the strangest thing in this sorry saga is 
	that there was no debate on the alleged offensiveness of the cartoon. 
	Exactly how did it offend the religious “sensibility” of the Muslims?&nbsp; The 
	cartoon does not insult the Prophet of Islam. At worst, by using two 
	simpletons, one adult and a child, it caricatures a mindset among Muslims. 
	The touch of irreverence that is there relates to a habit, not to the 
	Prophet. There was nothing in it that was “completely unacceptable,” the 
	term used by the editor in his apology.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The matter of hurting the religious 
	sensibilities of the Muslims is old hat. This time too the bogey has been 
	quickly invoked, and with vengeance and greater precision. The leader of 
	Jamaat-i-Islami reportedly said that it had hurt, specifically, the <i>iman</i>, 
	or faith &nbsp;(in God, His prophets, His Books and so on),of the Muslims of 
	Bangladesh and the world. I have always found such talk quite infantile. 
	Should not the <i>iman</i> of an individual be strong enough to withstand 
	any perceived attack? Is not a weak <i>iman</i> itself an inglorious thing 
	for a Muslim to possess? And how does a religion that is supposed to have 
	matured over a period of almost 1400 years get hurt by a mere cartoon such 
	as this? </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is perhaps pertinent here to contrast the 
	outrage of these Islamists to the complete lack of it when serious 
	infringements of the acknowledged principles of the Koran itself have been 
	committed. Take for instance the wonton killing of dozens of innocent people 
	by Islamist terrorists in Bangladesh over the past few years. The Koran says 
	that if one killed a single innocent person “it would be as if he slew the 
	whole people” ( V:32). ‘Moderate’ Muslims often quote the verse in defence 
	of Islam against allegations that it often encourages violence. Yet there 
	was no outrage from the Islamists when their co-religionists perpetrated the 
	killing of dozens on the soil of Bangladesh. Was the ‘offence’ of the 
	cartoonist greater than the sins of those killers?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to the question of who exactly were 
	at the forefront of the present expression of outrage. The list of persons 
	and organizations protesting the cartoon is speaks for itself. It includes a
	<i>khatib</i> who wanted to do <i>jihad</i> against America for its invasion 
	of a Taliban Afghanistan. Organizations prominent on the list have sworn to 
	make Bangladesh an Islamic State at all cost. Some of these organizations 
	have led violent attacks on the <i>Ahmadiyas</i> and would have the 
	community declared non-Muslim. Some of them have direct or indirect links 
	with Islamist terrorists. One wonders, then, instead of confronting them, 
	why was so much effort spent on appeasing them.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be futile to tell the <i>Mullahs</i>, 
	especially in the present situation, that man’s creative genius thrives on 
	breaking the bonds of the tradition and exploration of the new. The cartoon 
	in question was a miniscule example of looking at the mundane with a new 
	pair of eyes. But they would not understand such subtleties. But they must 
	at least be made to understand that freedom of expression is something we 
	are not about to forego.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sadly, on the issue of the cat cartoon it is they 
	who have declared victory. It will be tragic if we let this be repeated. The 
	first essential step for us will be not to let the issue pass, but to go on 
	arguing, in every forum and even after the rage has died down, that the 
	cartoon did not deserve condemnation, and neither did its creator, Arifur 
	Rahman. Meanwhile we must to all we can to secure the artist’s release. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
