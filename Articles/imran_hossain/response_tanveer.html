    readers: a real freethinker never considers using such languages. I thought
    I would not reply Mr Freethinker’s jargonised silly mega essay, but I
    decided later to reply because he mentioned my name. I can beat each line of
    his mega essay. But, you readers will lose patience to read. If I beat every
    sentence of his 15-page-long essay, I have to write at least 50 pages. I
    think I should not give a damn to this jargonised essay.</font></span></h5>
    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="COLOR: green"><font size="3">&nbsp;I
    wanna today let ya&nbsp;know a very interesting good news that is: this so
    called “self-proclaimed” freethinker Mr Tanveer’s mindset is very
    similar to Mr Laden and other Islamists. He is trying to protect Islamic
    terrorists by making a small comparison. It is my very pleasure to introduce
    an Islam-Zealot atheist. He follows the Islamists the way they behave. Like
    Islamists, like Tanveer.</font></span></h5>
    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="3">Anyway,
    let me start. I appreciate your 15-page-long article. You at least spent
    four hours to write and another one hour to revise it. <span lang="EN-GB">Whether
    you and your sidekick Kamil Arif are atheists or Muslims, does it really
    make any difference in the freethinking world? You two folks are pretending
    to be freethinkers. But your attitudes do not look like that. It is not new
    to us that Islamo-zealots are coming in many “shapes and forms” <a style="COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single" target="_blank" href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/debates/KamilArif.htm">(Sina</a>).
    People like Kamil Arif and you want to make prides being “self
    proclaimed” atheists. But, we discovered this tactic before you and Kamil
    were born in the cyber world. Your behaviour nicely matches the approach of
    ‘online terrorists (Jihadi).’</span></font></h5>
    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">&nbsp;You
    wrote a handful of criticisms of Islam. Mr Freethinker, we are not ignorant.
    We understand. There is a saying in Bangla, “bikkher porichoy fole.” The
    exact English is “fruits represent the characteristics of trees.”
    Whether you people claim to be atheists or freethinkers, this method is not
    gonna work here. Your writing characteristics are significant to the
    discussion, not your personal title.&nbsp; You showed some anti-Islamic
    posts earlier. Now I know why you did it. Your intention is to delude other
    freethinkers. Now, it is very plain and simple to recognise what you really
    want. You are virtually supporting Islamic terrorist brothers in the title
    of “freethinker.”</font></span></h5>
    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">Islamic
    terrorisms and many Muslims' incorrect behaviours are the greatest concerns
    to this world. If Islamic kids keep perpetrating the crimes, I hope the West
    will decide whether they allow Islam in their land anymore. Islam is not a
    religion. It is a political movement set. Its plans are to destroy the
    liberty and religions of all other mankind to establish Mohamed’s brand
    religion. This is the holy plan derived from a psychopath. Muslims are so
    miserable because of following Mohamed. If Muslims were to choose their own
    intelligence, they would certainly have had technology and human
    civilisations. You guys in the title of atheist and freethinker are
    energising the online Jihadi terrorists. Online Jihadi soldiers are
    resentful of the internet service policy because they can not identify the
    mailing addresses of anti-Islamic people. Remember that Islamic stupidity is
    survived so far just because of insulting, killing, and exiling its
    opponents. Now, it is no more possible. Bill Gates and his teams help us
    reveal the truth of Islam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></h5>
    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="3">Anyway,
    Muslims divide the human beings in two different parts. All Muslims are the
    same (brothers), and other humans are lower humans. Tell us why you guys
    consider Muslims as superior human beings than anyone else. Because, your
    prophet did it. Right? Like prophet, like followers. You folks are afraid to
    disobey Mohamed’s order.</font></h5>
    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.2pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font size="3"><span lang="EN-GB">I
    do not claim to know everything. I would say that I am better in Islamic and
    its related issues.&nbsp; My point is Islamic terrorisms that are done by
    some Muslims. The problem is not with England, UN, or Israel. The very
    problem is Islamhood. We both know that Jews used to live in the Palestinian
    area loooooong time before Mohamed and his new brand religion ‘Islam’
    came on earth. When Muslims occupy something, they think that belongs to
    them forever. Muslims are very resentful of Spain because they could not
    retain the colonisation in the invaded land. Several hundreds years ago,
    Muslim rulers were kicked out of Spain. Now Muslims are still planning to
    attack and reinvade Spain. What a strange thing! If Saudi or Iran was
    defeated by Spain, people of these countries may deserve to fight and
    reinvade Spain. The game show is not like that. The show is utterly
    stupidity. Muslims from all around the world want to go with the same. This
    is a nonsensical expectation. ‘Muslim’ is the identity of human beings,
    no culture, no nationalities. What an idiotic system! More crimes were
    perpetrated by many Muslim countries than Israel did/does, but Bangladesh
    did not ban relationship with those infected Muslim countries just because
    of Islamhood. Tell us: “<span style="COLOR: black">What </span></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="COLOR: black">Israel
    has done to Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh or Malaysia? Why people in these
    countries and all the Muslims of the world think Israel should be wiped out
    of the map and the Israelis should be driven into the sea?”</span><span lang="EN-GB">

    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">Now
    another question is to you and your companion Kamil. If you think all people
    are human and their rights and life must be protected, then tell us: what
    have you atheists done for the women and minorities in the Islamic countries
    who are the 2nd and 3rd class citizens respectively? How many mega essays
    you boys have written?</font></span></h5>
    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="COLOR: blue"><font size="3">“me
    or my friend Kamil...both of us are atheist, not muslim.”</font></span></h5>
    <h5 class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 36pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">Go
    to your Muslim brothers’ lands like KSA and Iran, and say “we are
    apostates of Islam; we are atheists, not Muslims. And we truly believe
    Darwin’s evolution, not Allah’s creation theory. ” Then you will
    understand what Islam, Islamic terrorisms, and Muslims are. Please request
    your Muslim brothers to let us know how they gonna behead or chop you two,
    or you can also request them to capture video like how they did Nick
    Berg’s one.</font></span></h5>

    about Islamic terrorisms? Why doesn’t he write when Muslims kill the same
    Muslims and Kaffirs? You guys are very knowledgeable indeed. In hypocrisy!

    our dads are Muslims. They are Muslims just because of their birth. Our
    ancestors accepted Islam by not even understand any meaning of it. Even
    today, only some foolish people would chose to convert to Islam without/with
    understanding it. Our parents may keep beard, pray five times a day, and
    performed hajj. Just the rituals. But, I am sure that they do not use <a style="COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: underline; text-underline: single" target="_blank" href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/quran_teaches.htm">the
    ‘teaching parts’ of Koran</a> and Hadis that are chosen and practised by
    Mr Laden party and other Jihadi organisations. You might have a very good
    knowledge in other fields. But, your posts so far prove that you do not know
    much about Islam.</font></span></h5>

    is not the same as Islamic terrorisms. Of course I will try to resists.
    There are thousands of people are being attacked in Bangladesh every week.
