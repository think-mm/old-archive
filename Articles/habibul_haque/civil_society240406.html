	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The recent debates over the 
	political role of civil society and the flurry of writings on this subject 
	are positive developments and signs of the vibrancy of the civil society in 
	Bangladesh. What is civil society? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Civil Society is not just the sum-total of the NGOs. Nor is it a club of the 
	elite. It is foremost an idea, indeed a great idea that keeps democracy 
	working. It is a space -- non-coerced, of course as Micahel Walzer reminds 
	us -- where people discuss freely issues of interest to them with an eye to 
	collective wellbeing. An associated -- but not coterminous -- concept is 
	Public Sphere. Concepts such as these are better understood if they are 
	contrasted with their opposites. For example, public sphere is contrasted 
	with private sphere and civil society with the state. <br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Civil Society is best understood 
	when it is contrasted with or differentiated from political society or 
	religious society. The idea of civil society had its roots in the separation 
	between the Church and the State. St. Augustine's differentiation between 
	the &quot;city of god&quot; and the &quot;city of man&quot; in the 5th century was one of the 
	earliest formulations. Although St. Augustine sought return of the &quot;city of 
	god,&quot; the notion of an autonomous secular domain incorporating both the 
	state and the civil society inadvertently arose. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Europe, throughout the Middle 
	Ages, civil society remained submerged under the dominance of the Church. It 
	is around this time, Islamic civilization based in Andalusia saw a vibrant 
	Public sphere. Political theorists such as Rousseau in the eighteenth 
	century wanted to wrench civil society out of the dominance of the Church to 
	secure individual freedom. At that time civil society included the state 
	under its fold. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The differentiation made between 
	political society and civil society is more recent. In modern society, civil 
	society came to be defined as an arena outside the state (or political 
	society). Here civil society still remained quite inclusive with economy and 
	family within its fold. That was the view of civil society in the nineteenth 
	century held by Hegel and Marx. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Recent formulations make a further 
	differentiation between civil society and economic society. Market is kept 
	out of civil society analytically. Social scientists now generally concur 
	that the threats to civil society may come from political society as much 
	from the economic society. There is a real threat of civil society being 
	gobbled up by the forces of market. It is important to keep the minimalist, 
	albeit abstract, definition of civil society in mind; it is an uncoerced 
	space for deliberations. And it is crucially important to maintain the 
	autonomy of that space. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This however does not mean that 
	civil society is apolitical. Civil society has always had a political role 
	in the broader sense of politics but not in the narrow sense of politics 
	which is about how to grab political power. To deemphasize the potential 
	political role of civil society in many illiberal democracies the choice 
	phrase is civic society and not civil society. The difference between the 
	two concepts is not mere semantic. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Both civil society and the arena of 
	politics belong to the public sphere. A politician like a civil servant or 
	an NGO activist is engaged in public service. Intellectuals are sometimes 
	classified as either a public or private intellectual. The likes of Rehman 
	Sobhan, or Professor Zafar Iqbal, a scientist and a talented author take a 
	public stance on various issues, thus they qualify as public intellectuals. 
	For example, Arundhuti Roy is a fine public intellectual in addition to a 
	celebrated writer. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One should not get the idea that to 
	be a member of civil society one has to be a writer or public intellectual 
	but the leadership has to come from people who have the ability, time, and 
	interest in conducting such deliberations. It is often the public 
	intellectuals who are at the helms of the civil society because of their 
	ability to formulate ideas that seek to ensure public interest. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus civil society is a free space 
	in theory. The actual utilization of this space is circumscribed by various 
	limitations. Some of the discussions that whether civil society is a club of 
	the elite miss the point completely which prompted this discussion. The main 
	purpose of this preamble is to situate the ongoing debate on the role of 
	civil society or &quot;shushil samaj&quot; in the political process of Bangladesh in a 
	theoretical frame. <br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In real time and real life, social 
	evolution did not take place in a linear fashion with the separation of 
	civil society from the other domains such neatly. Religion came back with 
	vengeance as a political force which baffled social scientists who thought 
	that with time religion would become a matter of the past. There is 
	sacrlaization along side and opposed to secularization. Most social analysts 
	think in terms of linearity, while society does not show much respect for 
	continuity and linearity. So it would be useful to talk about uncivil 
	society as we consider civil society. Civil society evolves in an ongoing 
	battle with the forces opposed to it. <br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Uncivil society is a force -- 
	outside of the authority of the state which threatens civil society. State, 
	however, may be complicit with the uncivil society. The state apparatus of 
	Bangladesh is at risk of being captured by the forces of uncivil society.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That has led some alarmists to use 
	phrases like “failed state” to refer to Bangladesh. Many writers point to 
	drug cartel and other such antisocial elements as uncivil society. A band of 
	criminals are not just uncivil, they are anti-social. Civil society 
	minimally requires an element of civility in its definition. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Uncivil society is that aspect of 
	civil society which challenges the norms of civil society. In the place of 
	&quot;shushil&quot; it tries to establish &quot;ashil&quot; if not &quot;ashlil&quot; samaj in which 
	indecency, if not outright vulgarity, intemperance if not intolerance tend 
	to dominate public discourse. Instead of decency and reasoned discussion, 
	lies, fabrications, rejections of norms of fairness and the cynical (mis)use 
	of religion tend to be the new norms which may either devalue, or worse, 
	displace decent society. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The main purpose of the civil 
	society or &quot;shushil samaj&quot; is to fight for the rehabilitation of norms of 
	decency and fairness. And it is towards that goal people who value these 
	norms must come and take part in public deliberations. The role of reasoned 
	discussion and debate in democracy cannot be overestimated. In that sense 
	civil society becomes a prerequisite for democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) has 
	been particularly innovative in bringing together different stake-holders in 
	the policy making process, i.e., politicians, civil servants, academics and 
	others who are interested in such deliberations on the same platform which 
	is an unusual scene in Bangladesh. To characterize these talks as elitist is 
	simply ignorance. In any society, the entire population cannot be expected 
	to come out and join the town hall meeting to discuss issues of common 
	interest. The question is whether the disenfranchised, the peasants, the 
	subalterns get a voice or not. <br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The separation of elite and masses 
	is not always clear cut. On April 14, 2006 when Dr. Kamal Hossain went to 
	Kansat for a fact-finding mission and to express solidarity with the 
	struggling people, he was not just an Oxford-educated internationally 
	reputed lawyer and a key figure in the national history of Bangladesh, he 
	was one of the Bangladeshis who could reach out. There were many non-elite 
	Bangladeshis who kept a safe distance from the &quot;trouble&quot; and concentrated on 
	the celebration of pohela baishak. Or when Hameeda Hossain, an 
	Oxford-educated historian of great distinction writes about the palpable 
	condition of the safety of the garment workers, she becomes the voice of the 
	voiceless. The charges of elitism come from people who have not done much 
	thinking or reading about these issues and can be reminded what Mao Xedong 
	(Cahirman Mao) once said -- I paraphrase -- one does not have to be a 
	shop-keeper to be a petty-bourgeoisie intellectual. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Intellectuals committed to public 
	cause or men and women with capacities for articulation of the voices of the 
	weak will play a larger role in civil society and in public affairs. This 
	does not mean that civil society has to have a single voice. There could be 
	right, left, liberal or any other ideological positions as long as these 
	views are deliberated in a reasoned, considered, tempered, and decent 
	manner. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Mr. Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury, a 
	noted journalist launches a critique of the initiatives of the Citizens' 
	group that gathered the likes of Professor Yunus or Justice Habibur Rahman 
	it needs a careful assessment. The position of Mr.Chowdhury in the history 
	of Bangladesh will remain immortalized by his memorable Ekushey song which 
	will outlive any one of us. His criticism of Professor Rehman Sobhan, 
	another key figure in our history seems fratricidal to me. Rehman Sobhan was 
	one of the authors of the two-economy theory in the 1960s that shaped the 
	six-points movement led by Bangabandhu which laid the foundation of our 
	struggle for emancipation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury invokes 
	the phrase &quot;chattering classes&quot; to characterize the leading public 
	intellectuals of Bangladesh. That is regrettable because this phrase was 
	invoked by the conservative politicians in U.K. to undermine the legitimacy 
	of the leading intellectuals. But what about chattering classes? <br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to Joe Moran: &quot;Chattering 
	class -- a term that suggests a cadre of metropolitan, left liberal 
	professionals with nothing better to do than twither on about the country's 
	problems at posh dinner parties, detached from the realities of political 
	power and the aspirations of ordinary people&quot; (New Statesman October 24, 
	2005). They are, in Moran's words, &quot;Urban intellectuals, good people who are 
	well-informed, big-hearted but small in numbers.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Are people like Professor Yunus just 
	urban intellectuals? Yes, there are chattering classes in Bangladesh who 
	spend an inordinate amount of time chatting in the drawing rooms solving all 
	the problems of the world in one session. Amartya Sen in his The 
	Argumentative Indian provides a good example of the argumentative nature of 
	not just Indians but Bengalis as well. He uses Raja Ram Mohan Roy's anecdote 
	that the only tragedy of dying is that he won't be able to argue and debate 
	anymore. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But those who participated in the 
	deliberations at the Sheraton Hotel on March 20, 2006 are not just 
	chatterers; they have a proven record of public service. Mr. Chowdhury also 
	points out Sheraton Hotel as if Sheraton Hotel is a villain. There are other 
	critics who also accused the Citizens body of elitism. In my opinion this is 
	a cheap shot. A person such as Professor Yunus or Mr Abed or Ms Khushi Kabir 
	or Professor Zafar Iqbal can sit at Sheraton or Hotel Sonargaon or wherever, 
	it is what they think and do that counts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we move to a more technological 
	and consumption oriented society, there are people who would like the 
	intellectuals to keep their mouths shut or keep their laptops locked. The 
	less they talk the more profit can be earned by the corporations. The less 
	they deliberate, the more political advantages can be secured by the 
	unscrupulous politicians. <br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are forces of uncivil society 
	at work in Bangladesh. These are made up of people without scruple or 
	ability to engage in a reasoned debate. They are protected by ill-begotten 
	money. They are products of a corrupt culture. Some of them are ever ready 
	to trade their intellectual integrity for material benefits thrown at them 
	by their political overlords. Mr. Gaffar Chowdhury himself has pointed out 
	in his various columns the rise of these unholy forces. And when he turns 
	his intellectual force against the champions of civil society he forgets 
	(temporarily, I hope) that there are many who would be glad to see Rehman 
	Sobhan not talk and Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury not write. Should these forces be 
	given a walk-over? </font></p>
