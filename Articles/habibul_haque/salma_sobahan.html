	I often wondered what kept many of my compatriots from knowing some of the 
	true heroes in their own midst. Is it because we are less enthusiastic about 
	knowing the achievements of a fellow citizen than finding about their 
	scandals? Upon reflection, I realised that this could also say something 
	about the personality in question. Some people are reluctant to bask in the 
	glory of success or media attention, they carry on with the jobs they have 
	committed themselves to. Salma Sobhan, who passed away shortly after the 
	midnight between December 29 and 30, 2003 was such a person. I often wished 
	to see her as an ambassador of Bangladesh for the simple reason that apart 
	from her enormous talents and brain, she was a rare person whose both 
	parents were ambassadors. I cannot think of another such example. Salma 
	Sobhan's father was Mr. Ikramullah who was the first foreign secretary of 
	the newly independent Pakistan and subsequently represented Pakistan as an 
	ambassador. Salma Sobhan's mother Begum Shaista Ikramullah too was 
	Pakistan's ambassador to Morocco. Her father-in-law too was once Pakistan's 
	ambassador. It would be an understatement to say that Salma Sobhan was 
	unobtrusive. She never told me that she was the recipient of the famous 
	Human Rights award from the Lawyers' Committee in USA in 2001. It was Ms. 
	Sigourney Weaver who presented the award to her in person. I had to find it 
	out the hard way -- a search through Internet -- as I was preparing a brief 
	resume on her. Salma Sobhan's maternal uncle was Hussain Shahid Suhrawardy 
	and her paternal uncle was Justice Hedayetullah who later became the Vice 
	President of the Republic of India. Her younger sister is married to Hasan 
	Bin Talal, the uncle of Jordan's Monarch. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such illustrious family background 
	fades in comparison with her personality, which is full of wit and wisdom. A 
	social activist driven by a conscience and a commitment to the causes of the 
	disadvantaged, she was one of the founders (along with Dr Hameeda Hossain) 
	of Ain O Salish Kendra (ASK). She left her teaching career in law at the 
	University of Dhaka to commit herself fully to this organisation of legal 
	aid to the poor women and became a champion of human rights, especially of 
	women and children and other disenfranchised communities in Bangladesh.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Once I received Salma Sobhan at 
	Changi airport of Singapore shortly after the assassination of Prime 
	Minister Rajeev Gandhi and as we were heading to city she was discussing the 
	tragedy and how shocking it was to her sister (at that time wife of the 
	Crown Prince of Jordan) who knew both Rajeev and Sonia from her Cambridge 
	days. As we were discussing the implication of this murder for Indian 
	politics, our English-speaking taxi driver took part in our discussion. He 
	said -- with a characteristic elitist bias -- why kill a Prime Minister, why 
	not an ordinary peasant? Salma Sobhan interjected: &quot;Why a peasant? His life 
	is as precious as that of the former Indian Prime Minister&quot;, she argued. The 
	exasperated driver then said: &quot;Ok, if you have to kill someone, kill a dog&quot;. 
	Salma Sobhan retorted, human beings have souls and according to many 
	religions there is resurrection or transmigration of soul but the poor dog, 
	many believe, has no soul; once it is dead, it is gone forever. Our friendly 
	driver, at that point gave up. Little did he know that his passenger clad in 
	a cotton sari with unkempt hair from a red-eye flight and an unassuming look 
	was a barrister and a humanist. I asked her later whether she knew anyone in 
	Singapore. Salma Sobhan told me casually that she once met the wife of 
	Singapore's founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, Mrs. Lee. Before she was Mrs. Lee 
	and a senior at Cambridge invited Salma Sobhan to a tea party organised for 
	a handful of female Asian law students at Cambridge. Salma Sobhan quipped: 
	you can imagine how small that group was. I did not press her for any 
	statistics. Salma Sobhan was in Cambridge from 1955 to 1957 and in 1958 was 
	called to the Bar at the tender age of 21. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In another occasion, Salma Sobhan 
	was in Singapore along with Ms. Kamal (Lulu Apa). They gave a talk at a 
	Singaporean NGO dominated by lawyers and other female professionals. The 
	Singaporean feminist activists came to the talk but were milling around as 
	they were not apparently impressed by the diminutive Salma Sobhan with her 
	ordinary looking sari and less ordinary-looking mannerism. However, once she 
	started her speech, I saw a gradual change in the audience behaviour. Those 
	who were milling around stilled, those who were standing began to sit. In a 
	few minutes, some of the Singaporean lawyers were sitting on the floor with 
	rapt attention to her deliberations. What an engaging speaker she was! The 
	audience was spellbound. After the talk, the documentary film &quot;Eclipse&quot; was 
	screened to the feminists in Singapore. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Salma Sobhan, a personality 
	extraordinaire is no more. I had the great privilege of dining in the 
	company of some extraordinary individuals who glowed in their own light some 
	years back. It was a small gathering where Begum Shaista Ikramullah 
	(deceased), Mr. Obaidullah Khan (deceased), Dr. Rahmatullah, his daughter, 
	Dr. Mehraj Jahan and myself sat around a Japanese styled table for a simple 
	but sumptuous dinner hosted by Salma Sobhan and her husband Rehman Sobhan, a 
	legend in his own rights. In that dinner, I reminded Begum Shaista 
	Ikramullah of her essay published in the Reader's Digest on a promise that 
	Mr. Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan made to her. The essay was a 
	recollection of a conversation Begum Ikramullah had with Mr. Jinnah prior to 
	the birth of Pakistan. For a moment, I felt I was talking to history. Like 
	her mother, who authored the famous book From Purdah to Parliament, Salma 
	Sobhan was an intellectual of great calibre and an unparalleled moral 
	integrity. Salma Sobhan wrote a letter defending the publicity of 
	Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the pages of The Daily Star -- only 
	when Awami League was out of power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Salma Sobhan is survived by her 
	loving husband Professor Rehman Sobhan and two adorable sons Baber, an 
	economist and Jafar, who spurned a cushy lawyer's career in New York to 
	choose a career of journalism in Dhaka. Such a move does not surprise me for 
	both her parents Salma Sobhan, a personality extraordinaire, and Rehman 
	Sobhan stuck it out in Bangladesh amidst adversities. For Salma Sobhan, 
	Bangladesh was her base. She lived here and now she will be in eternal peace 
	here forever. She will remain a hero for all those who share her empathy for 
	humanity, especially for those who are socially excluded and disadvantaged. 
	She was a voice for those needed it most. As a human being she was a 
	personification of humility and decency, qualities we can collectively 
	emulate.</font></p>
