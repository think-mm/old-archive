	</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;To get rich is glorious.&quot; The 
	Chinese people at all levels have heeded this famous slogan of reformist 
	leader Deng Xiaoping. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even the Beijing Airport's tourist 
	information center, an official looking set-up, quoted me an outrageous taxi 
	fare (500 yuan or about US$60) to go to a hotel. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally, after managing to get a cab 
	outside and then paying him more than usual, thanks to his &quot;broken&quot; 
	fare-meter, we had a taste of market competition in China. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The experience of being swindled and 
	cheated is not uncommon in Beijing - or any big city for that matter - yet 
	there is no evidence of a social collapse at a time of break-neck economic 
	growth, moving at a rate of 9.2%. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The roads and highways are bustling 
	with traffic - not bicycles but automobiles. With economic prosperity came 
	more automobiles and traffic congestion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Compared to my 1996 visit to 
	Beijing, there were fewer bicycles on the road, yet there was a separate 
	lane for bikes and other muscle-powered vehicles. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we were stuck in traffic, I saw a 
	motorist driving a smart European car who was negotiating with traffic 
	police for the use of the bike lane. I am sure he was in a hurry and rich.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The police officer did not budge. 
	The driver had to abandon his plan. This pedestrian incident symbolised what 
	is going on in today's China. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The socialist government in creating 
	a market economy has created a bourgeoisie, but it is not completely 
	beholden to the new class and the government still cares for the working 
	class and the poor, whose rank are swelling due to rising unemployment.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the international sociology 
	meeting I attended in Beijing, organised by the International Institute of 
	Sociology, many of the papers by the local sociologists dealt with issues of 
	unemployment, the cutback of social welfare programmes in the villages, 
	regional disparity and so on. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The intellectuals are alive to the 
	problems - the price of progress - and are ready to discuss them openly in 
	Mandarin with instantaneous English translation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Russian participant painted the 
	bleakest of pictures of Russian society after the end of socialism. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such images of blight and social 
	collapse are not evident in reformist China unless you are a puritan who is 
	offended by the sights of so-called streetwalkers in the hotel districts and 
	karaoke joints in some back lanes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the fact that you can walk the 
	streets of Beijing in the late hours without being mugged is a legacy of the 
	socialist order and proof that China remains an orderly society and a 
	well-governed polity. The rise of the market economy has not become a 
	runaway monster crushing everything in its path. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The continuity in China has a 
	civilisational dimension. A visitor to the Forbidden City will first notice 
	the portrait of Mao Zedong adorning its main entrance, as if a tribute to 
	the &quot;last emperor&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I asked Lili, my interpreter turned 
	friend back in 1996, &quot;how about replacing that portrait [with] Deng 
	Xiaoping's?&quot; She was praising the leadership qualities of Deng and his 
	contributions to modern China. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was at that opportune point I 
	fielded my question. Lili replied almost instinctively, &quot;No, that place is 
	for Mao.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I had by then a compromise plan. 
	&quot;How about putting Deng's portrait next to Mao's?&quot; I asked. &quot;Deng is a great 
	leader but that place is for Mao,&quot; was Lili's reply. We did not continue 
	that discussion on that frosty evening in 1996. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">CCTV channel 5, which is an 
	English-language channel, was showing a place of tourist interest, an 
	idyllic hamlet with fountain and rural bliss. Domestic tourism is big in 
	China. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The tourist promotion story ended 
	with a side story that it was in that village in Jiangxi province where Mao 
	started his long march in 1934. A hut where Mao spent some nights has been 
	converted into a modest museum, which tourists are urged to visit. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the Ming Tombs, a tourist 
	attraction on the way to and from the Great Wall, there is a modest exhibit 
	of a small pavilion where Mao once read a newspaper. The champions of 
	capitalism have not forgotten the leaders of socialism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fact that the Great Wall was 
	built by successive generations of monarchs over a period of nearly 2,000 
	years is further proof of that continuity. It was started in the Qin dynasty 
	(221 BC) and ended during the Ming dynasty in the 17th century. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">James Jesudason, a sociologist from 
	the Colorado School of Mines, pointed out that the real reason for the Great 
	Wall was not security but state power. The emperors of various dynasties 
	were showing off their prowess by building this mammoth structure. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His hypothesis had a basis in the 
	mountainous terrain on which part of the wall was built. We had to take the 
	cable car to reach the wall. &quot;The mountain was deterrence enough, why build 
	a wall on top?&quot; asked Jesudason. I agreed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, there could be more to 
	adding glory and symbolic power. It was, I thought, Keynesian before Keynes. 
	Chinese rulers had to solve the problem of unemployment. Too many young, 
	able-bodied men hanging around in the cities were not being a good idea.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So if you could send them to build a 
	public works project in a remote area where they would be doing a patriotic 
	duty, a kind of &quot;food for work&quot; project, everyone would be happy. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The unemployed men would have food 
	to eat and meaningful work to keep them busy, and the royalty would be safe 
	in the city. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Employment creation remains the main 
	focus of the present day rulers of China as well. Unlike the subway system 
	in Singapore, Beijing's subway is filled with working women. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some selling tickets, others 
	standing at the gate checking tickets and answering questions (in Mandarin). 
	Giovanni Arrighi, a renowned historical sociologist made similar points in 
	his keynote address at the sociology meeting. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The main difference between the East 
	(Japan and China) and the West (Europe and later the United States) was that 
	there was an &quot;industrial revolution&quot; in the West; while in the East there 
	was an &quot;industrious revolution&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here Arrighi was quoting Japanese 
	economic historian Kaoru Sugihara. The key to Asian success from the late 
	19th century starting in Japan and later in China was the ability to harness 
	labour power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An industrious and self-motivated 
	labour force cut the cost of supervision and fueled economic growth. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The worker-manager ratio in China 
	stood at 15 managers per 5,000 workers whereas in the US, management was not 
	only top heavy but also there was often an army of mid-management cadres 
	that helped balloon production costs. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our taxi driver on the way to the 
	Great Wall was very knowledgeable and my colleagues engaged him in a lively 
	conversation. Ai Yun, a Marxist at heart, was doing the translation. James 
	asked how things during the communist days compared to the present. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although Ai Yun was filtering some 
	of the translations, it came out that things were not all that great. But 
	our translator was excited to find out that in those good old days people 
	did not even have to lock their doors. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Maybe they did not have any 
	valuable thing that needed protection,&quot; I quipped. Now theft has increased 
	because people have more things of interest to thieves. Socialist frugality 
	is deterrence for pilfery. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The comparison between China and 
	India often came up in discussions and small talk over breakfasts at the 
	hotel. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India has democracy; China has 
	accountability and so on. One thing struck me. India is nationalistic; China 
	is patriotic. Indian nationalism is often manifested in its anti-foreign 
	postures. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The root of nationalism lies in 
	anti-foreignness. China believes in opening its door to foreign capital and 
	technology (unless it is labor displacing). Chinese are more disciplined.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pragmatism defines China. One does 
	not have to go to China to see that. A visit to the Chinese Embassy and 
	Indian High Commission is enough. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have been a resident of Singapore 
	for the past 18 years, with permanent resident status in Singapore and a 
	respectable job at the National University of Singapore. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I blow my own trumpet for a reason. 
	The Indian High Commission could not give me a visa to go to New Delhi to 
	meet my friends without a clearance from the Indian High Commission in 
	Dhaka. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Actually, I have been away from 
	Bangladesh for the past 25 years so the Indian High Commission must have 
	extraordinary intelligence gathering capabilities to keep track of my 
	activities in Canada, the US and Singapore. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Incidentally, I have no problem 
	getting visas to go to the United States or Canada. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yes, in Singapore I was the 
	president of the Bangla Language and Literary Society, which has 
	Bangladeshis, Indians, and Singaporeans as members. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Okay, that probably was the reason 
	for the lengthy procedure of my visa. I reasoned with the officer: what 
	about my daughter who was born in Singapore and has seen Bangladesh only as 
	an occasional visitor. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Does Indian High Commission in 
	Dhaka have a file on my daughter as well?&quot; I got no answer to that question.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The consular section in the Chinese 
	Embassy was exactly the opposite. They did not want to get clearance from 
	their Dhaka office. Their questions were whether I needed it urgently or 
	after four days, not four weeks, which was the normal processing time.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For an urgent visa, I needed to pay 
	an extra $S35 (US$21). The fees are different for different speeds. With an 
	extra US$50 I could get my visa the same day. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am sure many business people would 
	appreciate this speedy process. No wonder, China attracted foreign 
	investment of US$52.7 billion in 2002 compared to India's US$3.5 billion.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">China provides a good example of 
	good governance. Good governance is good, old-fashioned common sense. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There must be intrigues in high 
	places in China. The handing over of the top military position to Hu Jintao 
	(already president and party chief) is a recent case in point. But a 
	collective responsibility toward the country helps tide over such 
	difficulties. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The root of all this is patriotism. 
	India's strong point is nationalism, China's patriotism. India's nationalism 
	helps keep tourists as well as foreign investments away. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A colleague of mine and I were 
	giving a briefing at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to a group of 
	prospective graduate students and researchers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At one point, one of them asked if 
	we had any Chinese post-doctoral researchers. I answered matter of factly, 
	&quot;We have a post-doctoral fellow from China.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Honestly, I did not know where our 
	post-doctoral fellow was from. My colleague corrected me by saying Dr Chan 
	was from Taiwan. No sooner had he finished his statement than, a Chinese 
	student retorted: &quot;But Taiwan is China.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It came out almost instinctively 
	from my mouth, &quot;That's what I said.&quot; A potential diplomatic crisis was thus 
	overcome. Yet the sense of patriotism on the part of the Chinese students 
	was unmistakable. You have to love your country first, if you want to 
	improve its socio-economic conditions. This is the lesson we can all learn 
	from China. </font></p>
