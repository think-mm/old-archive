	<span lang="EN-GB">Senator Edward Kennedy (Massachusetts Democrat) was a 
	staunch supporter of the liberation war of Bangladesh. And he has remained 
	so. The Pakistani military with the help of their local quislings carried 
	out brutal oppression in Bangladesh in 1971 against which the Massachusetts 
	Democrat Senator raised voice. &nbsp;There were other politicians and 
	intellectuals in USA who were friends of Bangladesh. Many of the supporters 
	of Bangladesh who in taking a favourable position towards the liberation war 
	of Bangladesh went against the official pro-Pakistan policy of the United 
	States government were from the New England area. For example, Michael 
	Walzer in a speech at Harvard criticized the Pakistan military for carrying 
	out repression in Bangladesh to the displeasure of Miss Benazir Bhutto, an 
	undergraduate student at that time. Ravi Shankar, Geroge Harrison, Ali Akbar 
	Khan, Alla Rakha Khan, Bob Dylan et al organized the famous Concert for 
	Bangladesh in Madison Square Garden, New York and not in Boise, Idaho. What 
	did it prove? Only New England States and liberal New York were interested 
	in Bangladesh or were outraged by the brutality of Pakistani repression? Was 
	that a mystery as well? YES, if we follow the logic of Dr. Fakhruddin 
	Ahmed’s “<a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/2005/09/23/d509231501109.htm">The 
	Mystery of the Letter to Dr. Rice</a>” (<i>The Daily Star</i> 23/9/05). What 
	has geography or number of people got to do with the expression of moral 
	outrage? </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">Bangladeshi lobbyists in USA during the liberation war, 
	namely, Rehman Sobhan, late Dr. Enayet Rahim et al were visiting college 
	campuses and influencing public opinion including the politicians. Who 
	knows? But it is not the geography but the substance of the issue at hand 
	that is important. The geography of support or opposition can be 
	successfully manipulated by the present U.S. administration to justify its 
	illegal and immoral war in Iraq by saying that a large number of 
	intellectuals opposing the war are from the elite universities which are 
	geographically located in and around New England. For example late Edward 
	Said was from Columbia University, New York; Noam Chomsky is from MIT, 
	Cambridge, Massachusetts; Paul Krugman and Richard Falk are from Princeton 
	University, New Jersey; Immanuel Wallerstein is from Yale University, etc. 
	Surely, they are not geographically well represented. But so what? &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">Why the letter to Secretary Rice was not published in 
	American press? The point is simple. Bangladesh does not loom large in the 
	horizon of US interest contrary to perceptions in sections of 
	left-intellectuals and naïve politicians in Bangladesh. Why was there no 
	meeting between George W and our honourable Prime Minister?&nbsp;&nbsp; The same 
	reason: Bangladesh is not a key partner of USA nor are we a client state of 
	the States. And on publishing news related to Bangladesh in <i>The New York 
	Times</i>, or other print media in USA we have not done well. US media are 
	interested in representing our disasters and only in rare occasions our 
	blips of success stories such as Grameen Bank of Professor Yunus. </span>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">To impute that the letter does not exist or the US 
	congressmen did not sign the letter is cynical, if not preposterous. 
	However, what is preposterous is to compare US judiciary with that of 
	Bangladesh. US judiciary has its shortcomings like many other judicial 
	systems. And in recent years, it has come under criticisms. But the stance 
	of the US judiciary with regards to Guantanamo Bay deserves respect. Anyone 
	interested to pursue this point should refer to two court cases: “Hamdi 
	versus Rumsfeld” and “Shafiq Rasul, et al versus George Walker Bush et al”. 
	I have reasons to believe that there are many men and women of impeccable 
	integrity in Bangladesh judiciary but because of our political culture, we 
	are still behind USA and other advanced democracies in separating judiciary 
	from the executive branch of the government. In USA, “you are innocent until 
	proven guilty” (this principle has been somewhat overshadowed only recently 
	by Homeland Security Act); in Bangladesh “you are guilty until proven 
	innocent”. At least, that’s what it appears when I read in the newspapers of 
	arrests on suspicion (and later “shown” to be arrested on this or that 
	charge) and extra-judicial killings. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">Taking a critical stance of US foreign and military 
	policies does not mean that we should part company with our sense of 
	objectivity. </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">It is true that US is not even-handed in her criticisms 
	of political violence in the world. US policies of looking the other way 
	when it comes to Israel’s violent behaviour is well-known but that cannot be 
	used as an excuse for overlooking our own political violence. With regard to 
	communal riots in India, especially Gujarat I am not aware of the reactions 
	of the US government but at a future date the infamous Chief Minister of 
	Gujarat, Narendra Modi was refused visa to visit USA. That does not look 
	like a position of indifference to me. One of the most memorable pieces on 
	Gujarat in an American paper (<i>The New York Review of Books</i>, August 
	2002) by Mr. Pankaj Misra did play a role in shaping the opinion of the 
	intellectuals and the discerning sections of the American public.</span></font></p>
	<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">What taxes my credulity 
	is when I read Dr. Ahmed saying: “I cannot believe that the US legislators 
	would quote TI and would be so mean-spirited to take such a swipe at 
	Bangladesh. They are far too decent and classy to be so crass.” The question 
	is: is corruption rife in Bangladesh or not? And the unequivocal answer is: 
	yes. To question the seriousness of the problem of corruption in Bangladesh 
	is crass. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, a regular contributor to <i>the 
	Daily Star</i> whose writings are well-liked by many readers, does recognize 
	the problem of political violence in Bangladesh and suggests some thoughtful 
	measures. He makes a good point by referring to another commentator as to 
	why US lawmakers did not take an equal interest in the attempt on the life 
	of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Again, US government was not 
	indifferent to that dastardly act that led to the death of 21 people. 
	Secretary Rice did call the leader of the Opposition to express her concern. 
	But in trying to hound for mysteries and conspiracies only obfuscate issues 
	that are of great importance for Bangladesh as a nation. Corruption, 
	political violence and the rise of religious extremism are issues that need 
	to be dealt with by all regardless of political position no matter whether 
	US lawmakers take interest in these issues or not. These are our problems 
	and if we do not deal with them now they will paralyze us and haunt our 
	posterity. It is reassuring to read that our security forces (especially, 
	the much maligned Police Force has shown glimmers of success by arresting 
	some of the suspects in recent weeks). They deserve praise and support.</span></font></p>
