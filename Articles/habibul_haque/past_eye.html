	</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font color="#006699"><b>Published
	March 31, 2005</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sidrah, a student of mine of 
	Pakistani origin at National University of Singapore came to see me the 
	other day. She asked me some questions on the course I was teaching, and 
	then she asked me whether I would answer some of her questions not related 
	to Sociological Theory, the course I was teaching. I agreed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sidrah was born more than a decade 
	after the birth of Bangladesh or the breakup of Pakistan -- depending on 
	which way you look at it. Her family has lived in Singapore for a long time 
	now. The distance from Pakistan gives her some detachment, if not complete 
	objectivity. A Pakistani in Pakistan would know, more or less, what 
	happened. There the official story was that India helped some &quot;misguided&quot; 
	Bengali leaders such as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to break up Pakistan. And that 
	was all. So there was not much to find out. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sidrah wanted to know what happened 
	looking straight into my eyes. She wanted to know in what way people of 
	Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) were different from Pakistan (then West 
	Pakistan) and why Pakistan could not remain united. After over three decades 
	these questions made me look back at a time when I was younger than Sidrah 
	today, a witness to hopes, tragedies, anguish, fear, relentless patriotism, 
	nationalism, revolution, liberation war -- in a word, history. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Memories came back to haunt me. Some 
	of my dear friends perished in that war. I was lucky to tell the stories to 
	none other than one who descended from the same people who were on the other 
	side of the divide. I do not know how the children of the Jews from 
	Auschwitz looked at the children of Nazis, or Palestinian children would 
	look at an Israeli. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I did not see her as an enemy. She 
	was just a twenty year old girl slightly older than my own daughter who grew 
	up in foreign land unencumbered by animosities or past baggage. They are 
	members of the &quot;Cell phone generation.&quot; They listen to Anasthesia and 
	Eminem. They do not care much about history. They look into the future with 
	eyes wide-open. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sidrah was different. She wanted 
	some answers. Is Islam in Bangladesh and Pakistan the same? I asked her 
	whether she was fasting. She said she did. Luckily on that day, I could also 
	say to her that I too was fasting. I told her that as far as religion was 
	concerned, we were practicing the same religion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What was different was our ways of 
	life, our dreams, aspirations, our language, our ways of eating and what we 
	ate, our marriage ceremonies, in a word, culture. The language movement of 
	1952 when people of East Pakistan fought for the rightful status of their 
	mother tongue. At this point Sidrah interrupted. &quot;What movement?&quot; she asked.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Somehow, her history lessons did not 
	include 1952. The language movement, the sacrifice of Bengalees on the 
	streets of Dhaka, Shahid Dibosh, etc were not part of the history curricula 
	in Pakistan, I presume. And when I told her of the banning of Tagore songs 
	in 1967, she exclaimed: &quot;What!&quot; in utter disbelief. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I told her about economic 
	exploitation and disparity; how Pakistan had used the hard earned foreign 
	currency from the export of jute that the peasants of Bangladesh grew to 
	build and modernize their cities and to industrialize and so on. The 
	economic disparity was glaring. All the cushy jobs went to the Pakistanis, 
	and Bengalis became second class citizens in their own country. It was 
	nothing but an internal colonialism. I told her the stories of political 
	oppression and cultural discrimination. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I told her how the rulers of 
	Pakistan systematically followed a strategy of exclusion. I told her that 
	the Muslim League which brought Pakistan on the map itself was created in 
	Dhaka in December, 1906, more than twenty years after the creation of Indian 
	Congress Party. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I told her that in 1946 a large 
	number of Muslims of East Bengal voted in favour of the creation of Pakistan 
	and how over the years they were excluded. By and large, the Bengali Muslims 
	-- both the elite and the common people -- were involved in the movement of 
	Pakistan but their hopes were dashed and they felt a deep sense of betrayal.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1971, after winning 167 seats in 
	the election of National Assembly of 300, Awami League under the leadership 
	of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was denied political power. I told her 
	of the brutalities of March 1971. I told her of the systematic extermination 
	of our intellectuals in the declining days of Pakistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I told her the whole story -- not in 
	anger but in a dispassionate tone of forgiveness. Why should I be angry? She 
	had nothing to do with the crimes of the past. Why should I put her on the 
	spot? I told her to read Hassan Zaheer's book. But can we just forget and 
	forgive? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I remember one moment of history 
	vividly. President Nelson Mandela came to Singapore to deliver Singapore 
	Lecture on March 6, 1997. We were waiting with batted expectation at the 
	Ball Room of Hotel Shangri-La. Mandela walked in escorted by a single 
	bodyguard. A tall, handsome, crew cut, smart, young white man followed 
	Mandela closely. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here was a man who spent nearly 
	three decades of his life in jail imprisoned by the white ruling class in 
	one of history's cruelest episodes. Now he was free man who forgave his 
	oppressors. He stood taller. </font></p>
