	Is Reading Going out of Fashion?</span></font><font size="5"> </font></p>

	<p align="center"><font color="#006699"><b>Published

	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have a feeling that more and more 
	people are quitting the habit of not only smoking but also reading. Quitting 
	smoking, though a good idea, is often involuntary. The cost of smoking keeps 
	rising, the government and non-smokers nag more, community becomes more 
	intolerant, and people become more health conscious. But what explains 
	quitting the reading habit? Are there social forces at work that make us 
	turn away from the habit of reading? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems that diet is one of the key 
	metaphors of our time. Many people are on a diet when it comes to reading or 
	serious intellectual activities. Some are on a diet in the sense of avoiding 
	food so that they can remain slim forever with no excess fat; others do the 
	same for reading. They avoid it as if too much reading will make them 
	lethargic, immobile with their heads in the cloud. Not that people are not 
	reading at all, some are reading but they are reading mostly “how to books”, 
	books that are practical guides. People are reading things that are deemed 
	to be useful for career enhancement. My concern is reading for the joy of 
	reading. Reading widens our horizons as late Guru Syed Mujtaba Ali, a Tagore 
	and Goethe aficionado, once lamented that we do not have eight eyes like the 
	flies who can see many things all at the same time. For us poor humans, we 
	can enhance our capacity to see many things all at a time and widen our 
	vision only through reading. While on an intellectual diet we may read books 
	on real diet but not books containing words of wisdom by Mujtaba Ali. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But is it the case that modern 
	society is putting blinders on us so that we can only see limited things. In 
	the age of specialization reading narrowly may be more productive. 
	Specialization often produces a tunnel vision and it is rewarded in the 
	world of experts and specialists. What happened to reading for its own sake?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I put this question to a number of 
	young people aged 19 to 22. These are some of the sample answers: </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“In the past people needed to read 
	books to find out about things and places, now they can go to those places 
	to see things for themselves, or see those places on television, or they can 
	access information via Internet so they do not need to read”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Time is scarcer now. There is 
	hardly any time for reading, especially for Junior College students who 
	spend all their time doing home work and preparing for the A-level 
	examinations”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“In the past people did not have 
	enough entertainment, therefore, they had to read for pleasure; now there 
	are so many ways one can entertain oneself that make reading unnecessary”.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A seventeen year old said: “Rather 
	than reading a book, one would like to go to a movie based on that book. You 
	know the story, what will happen at the end faster. In two hours you know 
	basically what is there to know. Why read a book which is expensive both in 
	terms of time and cost?” Modern society is making us impatient. We need to 
	get to the end now and not after 230 pages. Graffiti on my colleague 
	Maribeth’s T-Shirt says: “Life is short, eat the dessert first”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is it part of the phenomenon that 
	sociologist Ritzer called, “McDonaldization”? We want not only fast food; we 
	also want fast banking (ATM machine is to a bank, what McDonalds is to a 
	restaurant). We want McPaper, newspaper that can be read very fast say 
	between the starting and get off points on a bus ride. When USA Today was 
	launched in the 1980s it was immediately labelled as McPaper. Recently my 
	intellectual colleague Anne complained after a trip to US that in her hotel 
	they supplied USA Today and not the New York Times. We want everything as 
	fast as possible. We want a fast track education and then we want to be rich 
	fast. We want a fast car as we want a faster computer and even speedier 
	Internet connection. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is decline in reading texts a sign 
	of the rise of the digital society? Is the arrival of information society 
	undermining knowledge society? In the US a survey conducted by National 
	Endowment for the Arts (NEA) last year found that literary reading is in 
	dramatic decline with fewer than half of American adults now reading 
	literature. But fewer than half is not all that bad when we compare that 3 
	out of 20, a figure I arrived at when I asked a bunch of 20 young people 
	whose honesty, if not reading habit, is impeccable. The US study found an 
	overall decline of 10 percentage points in literary readers from 1982 to 
	2002, which translated in actual numbers, meant a loss of 20 million 
	potential readers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The July 2004 NEA survey also found 
	that literature readers watched an average of 2.7 hours of television each 
	day, while people who do not read literary works watched an average of 3.1 
	hours daily. When I read Bimal Mitra’s Kori Diey Kinlam (in two volumes over 
	1500 pages) as a secondary school student I had no access to television. We 
	had electricity, radio, and books but no television. And all the members of 
	the household – my late father, mother, and other siblings took turns to 
	read the book. My mother at 82 still recommends Bengali novels to me as she 
	squints to read. We did not have the distractions of satellite television, 
	hand phones, MSN chats, online gaming, Blackberry, and PlayStation2. Thanks 
	God for that. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bob Herbert of the New York Times 
	wrote in his obituary on Arthur Miller, the great American playwright and 
	the public intellectual, “Mr. Miller understood early that keeping the 
	population entertained was becoming the paramount imperative of the U.S. 
	We're now all but buried in entertainment and the republic is running amok. 
	Mr. Miller is gone, and if we're not wise enough to pay attention, his 
	uncomfortable truths will die with him. (He felt, among other things, that 
	most men and women knew &quot;little or nothing&quot; about the forces manipulating 
	their lives.) I wonder how widely generalizable these words are today!</font></p>
