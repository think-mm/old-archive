	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is in response to Thomas 
	Friedman's article titled &quot;A theory of everything&quot; published in Sunday's New 
	York Times. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There cannot be a theory of 
	everything. A theory that tries to explain everything becomes a dogma, not a 
	theory. In my view Thomas Friedman's theory is flawed because the premises 
	on which his theory is based are flawed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Premise 1</b><br>
	Why do they (the Muslim world) hate us? This was a wrong question to begin 
	with. The September 11, 2001, attacks were launched by a group of 
	disgruntled people (yes, by religion they were Muslims) who did not 
	represent any organized &quot;they&quot;, be it the Muslims of the world or even the 
	Arab Muslims. Non-Arab Muslims were not involved in the attack and their 
	response to the tragedy was quite similar to the responses that came from 
	elsewhere. The responses of the Muslims in the immediate aftermath of the 
	September 11 attacks were mixed, ranging from some people being very happy 
	(dancing on the streets in the West Bank) to expression of sympathy 
	(candlelight vigil in Tehran). Nobody knows for sure what went into the 
	heads of the attackers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. So far 
	what we have are nothing better than conjectures. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A large number of Muslims are 
	critical of US policy toward Palestine and they are at various levels of 
	anger, anguish and frustration. Not all Muslims are as mad with anger that 
	they will carry out suicidal missions. So a better-formulated question would 
	be, Why are some Muslims so angry with the United States to the extent that 
	they would blow themselves up to harm the US? Their psychology is not unlike 
	that of the radical groups in Palestine. I think the key word here is 
	&quot;anger&quot; and not &quot;hatred&quot;. The hatred theory was invented by President George 
	W Bush or his speechwriters. There are surely some super-angry men; 
	fortunately not all Muslims are super-angry. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I agree with Friedman that the 1990s 
	version of globalization had the distinct American imprint with such icons 
	of Americanism from Nike shoes to McDonald's and Coca-Cola worldwide. There 
	was resentment as there was adoration of these icons. Hollywood movies 
	became global not because US marines forced people around the world to watch 
	the movies. They were great movies. Why do people of the world embrace 
	American medicine or science or the Internet? They are the best in the 
	world. Where can we find someone as smart as Michael Moore or the creators 
	of The Simpsons? Maybe some people were jealous of the achievements of the 
	Americans, but most people admired and wanted to partake in those 
	achievements. There was no reason to be angry just because Karim Andul 
	Jabbar was a better basketball player or Tiger Woods was a better golfer. 
	People like good games. They are pissed off when the games become unfair. If 
	the rules of the game are fair, there will not be any resentment. The anger 
	thesis is wrong. There is, however, resentment with unfairness. And that 
	resentment was quite universal, cross-cutting national, religious and 
	geographical boundaries. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Premise 2</b><br>
	&quot;Why does everybody else hate us?&quot; This is again a flawed premise. During 
	the Iraq war, the United States had its allies. The world was divided 
	between unilateralism vs collective response. People outside the US were 
	critical of the US administration, the neo-cons, the Republican Party, the 
	hawks of the Pentagon. They often turned to some American critics of 
	American policy. Many people saw the point of US unhappiness with Iraq. Many 
	agreed that Saddam Hussein was not worth defending with his terrible record. 
	But the Muslims were hurt by the perceived US arrogance of unilateralism. 
	Some US officials were ready to go to war even without British 
	participation. Such was the height of unilateralism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many Muslims were divided, just like 
	Christians or Jews or Americans or Bangladeshis, on the issue of the Iraq 
	invasion. Some thought that it was against international law and held on to 
	the principle of national sovereignty. Others saw it as a civilizational 
	war. Many were ambivalent. Some people were pragmatic; others were concerned 
	with the moral and ethical consequences. How can we ignore this diversity of 
	views and opinions? Some of the most articulate critics of US policy were 
	not Muslims. They were Jews, Christians, Americans, Indians, Australians, 
	etc. One of the most strident critics was Arundhati Roy, the Indian author 
	and activist. I have talked to people from various countries, from various 
	walks of life, and I have searched carefully newspapers, opinions, etc. In 
	my estimate, the majority of the people on the planet were against the 
	US-led invasion of Iraq and the war made them angry not at US society as 
	such, but at the hawkish groups misusing the US preeminence to a 
	shortsighted objective. US-led globalization has no serious or organized 
	opposition, notwithstanding anti-globalization demonstrations. The US has 
	loyal supporters in the capitalist class all over the world, just as there 
	are critics of US capitalism in the streets of Seattle, where the 
	overwhelming majority were US citizens, as well as elsewhere. The most 
	interesting feature of globalization has been the messing up of geography. 
	We cannot neatly divide any more &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot;. The leftover class 
	conflict is diffused everywhere. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot; analyses are 
	gross simplifications. They are wrong. The majority of people, in my 
	opinion, were sad at seeing the destruction of the World Trade Center and 
	they were also sad to see the collapse of Iraqi society due to the war and 
	are worried about the reckless war of words against Iran. James Jesudason, a 
	friend and a fellow sociologist, says an equally compelling question for the 
	researchers to pursue, in so far as the hate game is concerned, is: &quot;Why 
	does the US hate the Muslims?&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have a simpler theory. People as 
	such prefer right over wrong. There is a global ethics. That human beings 
	are ethical is evident in the fact that most people do not find it 
	justifiable that the war on Iraq was based on the allegations of weapons of 
	mass destruction (WMD). At the same time, many of the critics of war will be 
	convinced that the war was justifiable if WMD are found. I will bet that 
	most people will not share the position that the US is powerful so we should 
	hate the US, as they will not endorse the position that we should support 
	the US because it is powerful. People make moral choices most of the time. 
	And many thinking people are often ambiguous in their responses. They say 
	something like: &quot;Yes, it is good that Saddam is ousted, but I feel sorry for 
	the children of Iraq or all those who were killed on both sides. Ideally, 
	the world should make sure that Saddams are not created in the first place, 
	etc.&quot;</font> </p>
