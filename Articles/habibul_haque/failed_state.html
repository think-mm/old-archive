	<span lang="EN-US">According to the <i>Foreign Policy</i>,&nbsp; (July/August 
	2005) “U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has warned that &quot;ignoring failed 
	states creates problems that sometimes come back to bite us.&quot; French 
	President Jacques Chirac has spoken of &quot;the threat that failed states carry 
	for the world's equilibrium.&quot; One of the major concerns of the United States 
	has been how to deal with the so-called failed states. In the last century 
	the major concern of the big powers was other big powers but now it seems 
	that their worry is the failing state. Allegedly, the failed states are 
	sources of drugs, illegal migrants, and terrorism and so on to the stable 
	West. But how far the fear of failed states is real or imaginary? And if the 
	fear is real, what are the forces responsible for the state failure? And, 
	what is to role of the major powers in the creation of the “failed states”?</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">The definition of the “failed state” is still 
	unsatisfactory. Max Weber, the famous German sociologist defined state as an 
	organization with monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Therefore, states 
	without such monopoly qualify as a failed state. Before the idea of failed 
	state came into vogue, some writers introduced a distinction between “hard 
	state” and “soft state”. Hard states were no-nonsense states with little 
	tolerance for corruption and as such were efficient state. In today’s 
	parlance these were states marked by good governance. Soft states were 
	sometimes malleable and were riddled with corruption. They were inefficient 
	and slow, if not dysfunctional. India was seen as an exemplar of soft state. 
	Robert Rothberg is credited for introducing the concept of “failed state”. 
	In his definition, sharply deteriorating living standards, self-serving 
	elites, food and fuel scarcity and a high level of corruption are the 
	tell-tale signs of a failed state. “On the political side,” according to 
	Rothber, “leaders and their associates subvert prevailing democratic norms, 
	coerce legislatures and bureaucracies into subservience, strangle judicial 
	independence, block civil society, and gain control over security and 
	defense forces.” (R. Rothberg, “Failed states in a World of Terror”, in <i>
	Foreign Affairs</i>. July-August, 2002). </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">Included in the definition used in the <i>Foreign Policy</i> 
	article, ”lack the authority to make collective decisions or the capacity to 
	deliver public services. …the populace may rely entirely on the black 
	market, fail to pay taxes, or engage in large-scale civil disobedience. 
	Outside intervention can be both a symptom of and a trigger for state 
	collapse. A failed state may be subject to involuntary restrictions of its 
	sovereignty, such as political or economic sanctions, the presence of 
	foreign military forces on its soil, or other military constraints, such as 
	a no-fly zone.” </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-US">Clearly these attributes of a “failed state” are drawn 
	from really existing failed states such as Iraq, Somalia, and Haiti. The 
	list of the top ten failed states also includes (1) Ivory Coast, (2) 
	Democratic Republic of Congo, and (3) Sudan. Haiti is ranked 10 and Iraq as 
	11. Sadly, Bangladesh ties the 17<sup>th</sup> position with Burundi. </span>

	according to their risk of failure. The first 20 countries are coded red,

	<span lang="EN-US">The Fund for Peace, an independent research organization, 
	and the Washington-based <i>Foreign Policy</i> have conducted a global 
	ranking of weak and failing states. “Using 12 social, economic, political, 
	and military indicators, they ranked 60 states in order of their 
	vulnerability to violent internal conflict. The resulting index provides a 
	profile of the new world disorder of the 21st century and demonstrates that 
	the problem of weak and failing states is far more serious than generally 
	thought. About 2 billion people live in insecure states, with varying 
	degrees of vulnerability to widespread civil conflict.”</span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">The idea of producing a list of states at risk of 
	collapse is controversial. Both the Colombian and the Peruvian ambassadors 
	wrote in questioning the merits of such a list in the September/October 
	issue of the <i>Foreign Policy</i>. Colombia was ranked 14 and Peru 44. The 
	fact that Bangladeshi diplomats failed to issue a rejoinder shows a certain 
	failure of the state machine. A senior USAID official, however, was pleased 
	that such a list was prepared which might send an alarm bell to the nations 
	concerned. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">However, it is important to examine the factors that lead 
	to the so-called state-failure. Iraq provides a clear example of state 
	failure by military intervention. Somalia and some other cases show the role 
	of outside powers in sapping the power of the state. But in a number of 
	cases, the mess is a local creation. Some states are forced to collapse 
	others corrode from within. What are the factors responsible for the erosion 
	of the states? </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">In the face of globalization, some argued that states 
	would be redundant; others thought states would be more powerful to 
	officiate and smoothen the processes of globalization. In fact, both 
	arguments are valid. In the uneven world forces of globalization weaken some 
	states as they make some states especially powerful. It is not a surprise, 
	then that the 7 of the 10 most at-risk countries are from Africa. These are 
	also the countries that perform miserably in the achievement of Millennium 
	Development Goals. Many of these countries were also the sites of civil wars 
	instigated by super-power rivalry of the past decades. It is the economic 
	failures caused by a complicated set of historical and politico-economic 
	forces weaken certain states. The vulnerability is not irreversible. </span>

	<span lang="EN-US">We can be patriotic and debunk the whole idea of failed 
	state, as a western conspiracy but there is no denying the fact that the 
	weaknesses in our governance are real. Just consider the failure of 
	tax-collection or the declining law order situation. The real tragedy for 
	Bangladesh is that many of the problems are self-inflicted. There is a 
	complete failure of consensus in Bangladesh where the government and the 
	opposition see one another as enemies. In the index for measuring state 
	failure lack of authority to make collective decisions is an important sign. 
	Let us take the example of bomb attacks of August 17, 2005 or August 21, 
	2004. In the latter instance, the inaction of the government was 
	conspicuous. By the way, what happened to Partha who was arrested from an 
	internet café for his alleged involvement in that attack and now that we 
	hear different story from some of the suspects under custody following the 
	recent spate of bombings. In order for the government to earn even a 
	semblance of credibility it has to act decisively and fairly to fight 
	terrorism before the problem gets out of hand. If political considerations 
	mar decisions as to whether a crime should or should not be investigated 
	that is as hopeless a situation as it gets. The fact that following the 
	recent bombings the law enforcing agencies could make a number of arrests 
	negate the idea of state failure. Time and again, the law enforcing agencies 
	in Bangladesh have shown their ability to perform but only selectively.&nbsp; In 
	fact, the government machinery has capability that remains unutilized or, 
	worse, misused. It is in times of disasters, we show our real potential. In 
	the past few years both under the Awami League administration as well as the 
	present administration, the government could act decisively and admirably to 
	tackle huge flood disasters. </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-US">The true tragedy of Bangladesh is that we fail not 
	because we cannot succeed but because we do not want to. The gap between 
	what is achievable and what is achieved in Bangladesh is both enormous and

	<span lang="EN-US">The characterization of Bangladesh as a “failed state” or 
	seeing 2 billion people at risk by the <i>Foreign Policy</i> is an 
	exaggeration. But sometimes an error on the side of caution is preferable to 
	denial of an ailment. &nbsp;There are good reasons to worry about a failed world 
	&nbsp;not just a failed state, yet there is no excuse for not setting our own
