	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The death of Pope John Paul II on 
	April 2, 2005 evoked sympathies, prayers, good words and condolences not 
	only from the Catholics and religious leaders around the world but also 
	from, laities, heads of the governments and states, and heads of various 
	international organizations. Of course there were some criticisms and 
	reservations but they were drowned in an avalanche of condolences. The 
	condolences came from various sections, religious groups across 
	denominations and geographical regions. That was truly a moment of unity, 
	global solidarity, and inter-faith understanding at its best. Or, that was 
	what it appeared to be. BBC Television as well as CNN covered the funeral so 
	extensively that they were accosted with emails protesting too much 
	coverage. The electronic media played a huge role in the return of sacred to 
	the extent that a major newspaper had a cover story declaring, “Religion is 
	still alive”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the phenomenon was more than 
	religious. It had a extra-spiritual quality. It was a defining moment of 
	globalization. The late Pope John Paul II was a truly global icon. Although, 
	I have not seen the list of condolence messages at the demise of the 
	previous Popes, the overwhelming reactions of sadness and condolence and the 
	display of that collective grief, thanks to satellite television and 
	internet, was truly a global phenomenon. And the late Pope himself as a 
	spiritual leader had a role in earth-shaping events such as the fall of 
	socialist systems in East Europe. The rot of socialist state was disclosed 
	when the working class, spearheaded by the Gdansk shipyard workers led a 
	protest movement in the early 1980s and soon it was evident that the 
	movement was broad-based with various segments of society on board including 
	the powerful but somewhat dormant Catholicism. A Pole at the apex of church 
	hierarchy surely helped. But the late John Paul ll was more than a 
	communist-buster; he showed his love for the suffering humanity and spoke 
	out against violence and oppression. He set an amazing example of love and 
	forgiveness when he visited his attempted assassin at his prison cell and 
	forgave him. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In moments of collective grief, 
	words play a very important role in conveying feelings. Emotions are best 
	channelled if they find appropriate phrases. Texts assume a special position 
	and deserve a careful analysis. Beneath the texts lie subtexts that also 
	call for a deeper understanding. It is important to consider who is saying 
	what and why. Are the statements and the texts through which these messages 
	are channelled innocent? What are the hidden meanings, the subtexts that go 
	with the texts? We look at the same event through our respective lenses. As 
	we consider the event, we must also examine the lenses through which the 
	event is seen. Historians have made remarkable contributions to knowledge by 
	examining the meanings and interpretations of not just the past events but 
	also such intangibles as memory and memorialization. Why and how do people 
	make things memorable? Less attention, if any, has been given to 
	contemporary processes of collective grief and more specifically, 
	condolence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A character in a Bengali novel upon 
	hearing that his peon has lost a younger sister to some mysterious disease 
	gave him some money and later confided that it is easier to give money than 
	to give condolence. What to do and say to express one’s sympathy is not 
	always the easiest task for an individual and there are huge cultural 
	differences in such rituals. But modern states and their leaders are quite 
	savvy in expressing their “feelings” of condolence. And in expressing such 
	feelings they reveal not only about the personality being condoled but the 
	political agenda of the nations articulating the condolence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Consider the following: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">President Fidel Castro of Cuba, one 
	of the few leaders around the world who outlasted the Pope in office, 
	credited the Pope for being a “tireless fighter for the friendship among 
	nations, enemy of war, and friend of the poor” (emphasis added). Mark the 
	choice of phrases: “enemy of war” and “friend of the poor”. It is also worth 
	noticing that the Castro government allowed a large mass to pray for the 
	departed Pope. Since the communist revolution of 1959, religion was 
	relegated to the margin but now it is back. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The late Pope John Paul has been 
	credited with a role in dismantling communism in the East Bloc, a movement 
	that began in Poland, his own homeland. Now it makes sense for President 
	Castro to say something that is ideologically on his side. No one can deny 
	that the Pope was against war including the first Gulf war as well as the 
	war to remove Mr. Saddam Hussein. By invoking the phrase “enemy of war”, a 
	poignant point was made. Pope’s support for the poor is also well 
	documented. Here Pope’s philosophy is not different from that of the true 
	socialists. No wonder “liberation theology” was a potent force in the 
	predominantly Catholic Latin America. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said 
	the Pope would be remembered for his travels and because he preached world 
	peace, citing the pontiff's opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
	Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Frias said he had a lot of time for him ... 
	&quot;he was very human ... I had a lot of warmth and affection for him ... 
	that's life, he has fulfilled his task.&quot; Chavez singled out the Pope's 
	condemnation of the invasion of Iraq as &quot;immoral and illegal&quot; (emphasis 
	added). Chavez, a popularly elected leader himself has been targets of US 
	policy makers and has been a survivor so far of covert and overt 
	interventionist policies aimed at his ouster. Colombian President Alvaro 
	Uribe said Colombians were &quot;divided between sadness for his passing and joy 
	for his example and message&quot; and were being &quot;called upon to reflect upon 
	peace in this country. If we can make it happen and the next generation 
	lives in happiness, His Holiness will look upon us with a smile and joy.&quot; 
	This statement is remarkably non-political which reflects Colombian 
	non-political position in the world at this moment. From Latin America, 
	let’s turn to Asia and start with a reformed Communist regime. In less than 
	three decades after Vietnam’s victory over the forces of imperialism, 
	Vietnam is in the throes of capitalist globalization. Prime Minister Phan 
	Van Khai of Vietnam sent a message of condolences to the Vatican's Secretary 
	of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano over the death of Pope John Paul II. 
	President of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee (VFF CC), Pham 
	The Duyet also sent a message of condolences which said: Pope John Paul II 
	was the religious leader who had made great contributions to promoting peace 
	and reconciliation, condemning genocide and war crimes and preventing the 
	spread of HIV/AIDS. Vietnam was the second largest Catholic country in Asia 
	after the Philippines where religion took a back seat under communism and 
	now making a return under a changed politico-economic circumstance. Vietnam 
	does not want to remember the old wounds and its message was well dressed 
	up. Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said the people of her 
	country &quot;received the news of his death with a deep sense of grief and loss. 
	He was a holy champion of the Filipino family and of profound Christian 
	values that make every one of us contemplate what is just, moral and sacred 
	in life.&quot; The focus on family is interesting so is the philosophical 
	overtone. Absent are war, peace, truth and justice. Liu Jianchao, spokesman 
	for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement expressing his 
	country's condolences. Liu's statement said in part, &quot;We hope the Vatican, 
	under the new pope, will create conditions conducive to the improvement of 
	relations with China.&quot; Religious activity by any group not specifically 
	permitted by the government is banned in China. Nor does China recognize the 
	Vatican's authority over Catholics in that country. A tone of reconciliation 
	is a good move. China needs recognition as a member of global community yet 
	it is less enthusiastic in embracing the globalized religiosity all the way. 
	In East Timor, President Xanana Gusmao said the Pope's 1989 visit to the 
	island while it was still suffering under Indonesian rule &quot;helped to break 
	down the wall of silence and indifference of the international community.&quot; 
	The leader of the tiny new state in Asia had to acknowledge the Pope’s 
	contribution in their liberation struggle candidly. &quot;Timor-Leste had the 
	honor of receiving His Holiness Pope John Paul II in difficult moments of 
	our struggle for the recognition of the right to self determination and 
	independence,&quot; Gusmao said. Even in countries where Catholics are a 
	minority, the pope was recalled fondly. The chairman of Indonesia's second 
	largest Muslim organization, the Muhammadiyah, praised the Pope's work for 
	global peace. Iran’s President Mohammad Khatami has sent an official message 
	of condolence over the death of Pope John Paul II, praising the late pontiff 
	as a seeker of “truth, justice and peace”. In a condolence message to 
	Vatican Secretary of State Angelo Sodano, President Mohammad Khatami 
	described him as a disciple of religious mysticism, philosophic deliberation 
	and thought and artistic and poetic creativity. Mark the words: truth, 
	justice, and peace. We will return to these words. Suffice it is to say that 
	Iran wants to engage with the world as a representative of an old 
	civilization. It does not want the pariah status. In 2001 it was at the 
	insistence of President Khatami that the United Nations declared that year 
	as the year of civilizational dialogue which unfortunately ended in huge 
	terrorist attacks and wars. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said 
	&quot;Israel, the Jewish people and the entire world lost today a great champion 
	of reconciliation and brotherhood between the faiths.&quot; &quot;The Jewish people 
	will remember the pope, who bravely put an end to historic injustice by 
	officially rejecting prejudices and accusations against Jews,&quot; Israel's 
	President Moshe Katsav told Israel Radio. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan 
	Shalom expressed deep sorrow over the death of Pope John Paul II, calling 
	him &quot;a great champion of reconciliation and brotherhood between the faiths&quot; 
	who strived for closer relations with Israel and the Jewish people. Israel 
	was stating the facts and did not try to put a spin. For political spin, we 
	turn to the Palestinian leadership. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said 
	the world has lost &quot;a very important religious figure who dedicated his life 
	to peace and justice for all.&quot; According to the Palestinian leader, the pope 
	will be remembered &quot;as a distinguished religious figure, who devoted his 
	life to defending the values of peace, freedom and equality.&quot; Let’s keep 
	these three key words in mind: peace, freedom and equality. &quot;He was a leader 
	that fought for peace in the world, was against the war in Iraq and even 
	wanted a free Palestine. He was an outstanding figure,&quot; Ahmad Syafi'i 
	Maarif, a Palestinian spokesman said. Sami Abu Zuhri, Hamas spokesman in 
	Gaza, told UPI that the movement is expressing its feeling of solidarity and 
	grief for losing the leader of Christians the world over. &quot;In this respect 
	we recall the Pope's statements that he always made, mainly when he called 
	for giving the Palestinians their legitimate rights of freedom and 
	independence,&quot; said Abu Zuhri. He said that Hamas movements as well as the 
	Palestinian people “are calling on the Pope's successor to keep the same 
	position that opposes the occupation and its crimes against Moslems and 
	Christians in Palestine.&quot; It is often overlooked that Palestine’s population 
	comprises 20% Christians and the fight for the Palestinians is not strictly 
	a religious conflict but a struggle for the right of self determination of a 
	people. The reactions of the Palestinians reflected that yearning. They 
	wanted the Pope’s charisma to sanctify their struggle. In South Asia, 
	another major abode for the Muslims, the reactions were equally quick and 
	forthcoming. &quot;His Holiness dedicated his life to the emancipation of 
	humanity, particularly the victims of conflict and deprivation ... I join 
	you in prayers for the eternal peace of the departed holy soul,&quot; Bangladesh 
	President Iajuddin Ahmed said. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, 
	told the country's state news agency that the pope had brought people 
	belonging to different faiths closer and had &quot;rendered incredible services 
	for peace.&quot; Pope John Paul II had rendered incredible services for peace. 
	The Pope had brought people closer belonging to different faiths,&quot; the 
	official Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Musharraf as saying in his 
	condolence message. Christians in Pakistan would mourn the death of the 
	pontiff for seven days with special prayers and masses for him, Chairman of 
	the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance Shahbaz Bhatti told the agency. &quot;The 
	Pope saved the world from a clash of civilizations by his efforts to create 
	inter-faith harmony and intra-religious dialogue…He was a symbol of 
	religious dignity and a champion of human rights.&quot; Bhatti said. Religious 
	minorities in Pakistan are often victimized and they needed all the support 
	they could muster for their rights. The government of India declared a 
	three-day mourning period, and President Abdul Kalam described the pope as a 
	church leader and statesman who worked for the needy and the oppressed. The 
	Indian President, in his message said, &quot;I am deeply saddened on the passing 
	away of Pope John Paul II&quot;, adding that the world has lost a statesman who 
	worked for human dignity and freedom throughout his life. &quot;He tirelessly 
	worked for peace on this planet and to establish an international order 
	based on equality and justice,&quot; Kalam's message added. As world’s largest 
	democracy and home to over 100 million Muslims, India has been a major 
	protagonist of human dignity and human freedom. So there was little 
	surprise. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We do not deal with the responses 
	from African leaders in great details except the following sample. President 
	Kagame described His Holiness the Pope as a caring father, shepherd and a 
	man who immensely inspired the world. &quot;At a time when the world was 
	experiencing a great drift away from the fundamental human rights, the Pope 
	advocated for social justice and a call for human rights,&quot; Kagame added in 
	the message sent to the Dean of the College of Cardinals, His Eminence 
	Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. He said that the people of Rwanda have for a long 
	time benefited from </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now let’s turn to Europe: </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jose Manuel Barroso, President of 
	the European Commission. expressed his sorrow in face of Pope John Paul II’s 
	death on Saturday night. In a statement he said &quot;I wish to express my deep 
	sorrow on learning of the death of His Holiness Pope John Paul II&quot;. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;To the Vatican and to the entire 
	Catholic community, the European Commission offers its condolences. I send a 
	special message of solidarity to the Polish nation which has known in Karol 
	Woytjila one of its most distinguished sons,&quot; he added </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The European Commission President 
	said that John Paul II will be remembered as someone who played an essential 
	role in the reunification of Europe and in the advance of ideas of freedom 
	and democracy in our continent. &quot;Europeans will never forget his struggle 
	for peace and human dignity,&quot; he continued. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jose Manuel Barroso concluded by 
	saying that &quot;His disappearance leaves a void in the hearts of all those, 
	believers and non believers, who have been inspired by his example of 
	courage and humanity.&quot; Leaders of heavily Catholic countries joined in 
	expressing the grief of their people. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis 
	Rodriguez Zapatero said the pope's death&quot;represents the loss of one of the 
	most towering world figures in recent history.&quot; Italian President Carlo 
	Azeglio Ciampi said Italians are &quot;mourning the loss of a father&quot; who will be 
	remembered as a man of freedom and justice. Irish President Mary McAleese 
	said Pope John Paul's story &quot;is that of a man of immense faith and 
	conviction and, in latter years, great personal courage. He engaged with 
	human culture and civilization in every aspect and in every corner of the 
	world.&quot; President Jacques Chirac of France said Pope John Paul was &quot;an 
	enlightened and inspired priest,&quot; who &quot;devoted himself to responding to the 
	search for sense and the thirst for justice that is expressed today on all 
	continents.&quot; Walesa was joined by current and former leaders of former 
	Soviet countries in crediting the pope's role in peacefully changing the 
	Soviet regime. Croatian President Stjepan Mesic said Pope John Paul's role 
	as a champion of improved relations among all peoples, countries, 
	civilizations and religions brought him the respect of millions throughout 
	the world. &quot;His place in history has long been ensured. Now he has taken his 
	place in eternity,&quot; he said. Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 
	called the pope &quot;the No. 1 humanist on the planet.&quot; A great line with a hint 
	of genuineness after all, Gorbachev is not the President of a nation at the 
	moment. Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany thanked the pope for 
	helping lift the yoke of communism from Europe. Former Czech President 
	Vaclav Havel said he remembered &quot;immense joy&quot; when hearing in 1978 that 
	Krakow Cardinal Karol Wojtyla was elected pope. &quot;I even think that we were 
	so delighted that we danced for joy,&quot; he said.&quot;We felt that he was a great 
	and charismatic man who will open the door to an unprecedented renaissance 
	of Christianity and, through it, to human spirituality in general and who 
	will fundamentally influence the future destiny and political order of the 
	world.&quot; In England, Prime Minister Tony Blair said the world had lost a 
	leader who was revered by people of all faiths. &quot;He never wavered, never 
	flinched, in the struggle for what he thought was right and good,&quot; he said. 
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard called Pope John Paul &quot;a pillar of 
	strength and an apostle of peace.&quot; &quot;He was not only a great moral and 
	religious figure, but he was also a very significant political figure in the 
	best sense of that term,&quot; Howard said. He said he fondly remembered his 
	talks with the pope during a visit to Rome two years ago.&quot; Although his 
	health had then begun to fade, he retained a lively sense of humor, a fond 
	recollection of Australia,&quot; Howard said. Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin 
	said as pope &quot;this noble son of Poland achieved an extraordinary impact, not 
	only as a source of spiritual guidance, but as a true apostle of peace.&quot; He 
	said Pope John Paul's visits to Canada, especially his 1987 trip to the 
	native peoples in the North and his participation in World Youth Day in 
	Toronto in 2002, were particularly important and unforgettable. &quot;Throughout 
	his papacy, and in his final days, we were all -- regardless of religious 
	belief -- privileged and moved to bear witness to the grace, courage and 
	resolve of this remarkable man. Our grief today is the grief of the world,&quot; 
	Martin said. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said after Pope John Paul II 
	died on Saturday that the world has lost a religious leader who was revered 
	by Catholics and non-Catholics alike for his &quot;unflinching&quot; struggle for what 
	he believed was good and right. And this is what former Prime Minister and 
	the Cold Warrior Margaret Thatcher had to say: “We should remember Pope John 
	Paul II not just as the greatest Pope of modern times but also as a valiant 
	fighter for the truth,&quot; she said. “His life was a long struggle against the 
	lies employed to excuse evil. By combating the falsehoods of communism and 
	proclaiming the true dignity of the individual, his was the moral force 
	behind victory in the Cold War. Millions owe him their freedom and 
	self-respect. The whole world is inspired by his example...” It is not 
	surprising that the Papal role in the fight against communism will be 
	remembered by a former leader of the so-called Free World. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Canadian leaders paid tribute to 
	Pope John Paul II, with Prime Minister Paul Martin calling him &quot;a true 
	apostle of peace&quot;. &quot;His wide-ranging travels, even at an advanced age and 
	despite ill health, were an expression of his determination to use every 
	opportunity to promote international reconciliation and respect for 
	democratic values and human rights,&quot; Martin said in a statement. Pope John 
	Paul II &quot;was the number one humanist on this planet&quot;, former Soviet 
	president Mikhail Gorbachev said early on Sunday, reacting to the pope's 
	death. &quot;The pope was able to do a lot not only for Catholics, but for the 
	whole world,&quot; Gorbachev told the Itar-Tass news agency. German Chancellor 
	Gerhard Schröder said that Pope John Paul II had &quot;changed our world&quot; and 
	played a major role in the development of a peaceful Europe. President 
	Jacques Chirac of France said Pope John Paul was &quot;an enlightened and 
	inspired priest,&quot; who &quot;devoted himself to responding to the search for sense 
	and the thirst for justice that is expressed today on all continents.&quot; What 
	were most interesting were US President Bush’s reactions. United States 
	President George Bush paid tribute to Pope John Paul II in a brief 
	appearance shortly after the pope's death, calling him a &quot;champion of human 
	freedom&quot;. Here's an excerpt of President Bush's statement -- and orders the 
	US flag lowered to half-mast. ”.. Laura and I join people across the Earth 
	in mourning the passing of Pope John Paul II. The Catholic Church has lost 
	its shepherd, the world has lost a champion of human freedom, and a good and 
	faithful servant of God has been called home. … All the recent US led wars 
	were “justified” in the name of freedom. Freedom became the leading metaphor 
	in the propaganda machine of the United States. From “Operation Enduring 
	Freedom” to “Freedom Fries”, freedom captured the imagination of all those 
	in favor of the war against Iraq. Later it was not lost on President Bush 
	that many leaders took advantage of the Pope’s anti-war position to conduct 
	shadow boxing with him. After meeting the Ukranian President Viktor 
	Yushchenko, Bush said of the Pope, “Of course he was a man of peace, and he 
	didn’t like war”. Former President Clinton said the pope had demonstrated 
	support for NATO action to end genocide in Bosnia and Kosovo. “I think he 
	favored defensive wars, if you will, or wars in defense of innocent people 
	being slaughtered”, Clinton said. For Clinton, “John Paul “may have had a 
	mixed legacy”. In a statement released shortly after the announcement of the 
	pope's death, Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Clinton said: &quot;In 
	speaking powerfully and eloquently for mercy and reconciliation to people 
	divided by old hatreds and persecuted by abuse of power, the Holy Father was 
	a beacon of light not just for Catholics, but for all people.&quot; U.N. 
	Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that apart from the pope's role as a 
	spiritual guide &quot;he was a tireless advocate of peace, a true pioneer in 
	interfaith dialogue and a strong force for critical self-evaluation by the 
	church itself.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pope’s life time has seen holocaust, 
	the carnage of the World War ll and the subsequent wars and little peace, it 
	was also a witness to hunger, famine, deprivation, the rise and collapse of 
	socialist systems, ethnicides in Central Europe, and Rwanda and Burundi and 
	the war in Iraq that he opposed. Phrases such as peace, justice, truth, and 
	freedom are potent words. The world is in need of peace, which will result 
	form an end to violence. It needs justice because injustice cannot be the 
	basis of peace. We need truth to uproot injustices and we need freedom to 
	search for the truth. Freedom is a means as much as it is an end. </font>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We may be somewhat sceptical about 
	the presentation of collective grief and the manipulation of the situation 
	to push forward national and social agenda but at the end of the day we 
	cannot deny that we need all these values to underwrite our common 
	civilization. </font></p>
