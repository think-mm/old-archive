	<p align="justify"><br>
	<font face="Verdana">Social scientists and assorted pundits are often 
	prolific in giving names to new social order. As society changes, the old 
	name becomes defunct. Agricultural society gave way to industrial society, 
	which was followed by post-industrial society, a name given by Daniel Bell 
	of Harvard University and Alain Touraine of France almost at the same time. 
	(Incidentally, both of them are sociologists). Agriculture is the main mode 
	of production, employing the vast majority of the people, in an agricultural 
	society. In an industrial society, industrial activities dominate the 
	economy. In a post-industrial society, the majority of the population is 
	employed neither in agriculture nor in the industrial sector, but instead 
	are pushers of papers. The service sector, or the tertiary sector, becomes 
	predominant in this stage. This is the phase that Alvin Toffler called &quot;The 
	Third Wave.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	In recent years, a new name has been invented for the post-industrial 
	society: it is information society, knowledge society, knowledge-based 
	economy, or KBE in short. We are somehow attracted to neologisms. I have two 
	reservations with regard to information society. First, I see a tendency to 
	hype information society or knowledge society. These are societies where not 
	everything is knowledge or information. I still need to wear shirts and 
	pants tailored by hardworking men and women who work long hours in garment 
	factories. I eat food produced by hardworking peasants and workers in food 
	processing industries. The only information I can wear is the T-shirt with 
	graffiti that declares the name of a popular sports club or a brand-name 
	university. The only information I can possibly eat is the alpha-byte 
	cereals. Other than these exceptions, I use information and knowledge like 
	my forefathers did in their times. In those days they needed little 
	information, now we need more. In an agricultural society, the peasants more 
	or less knew what they were supposed to know. If I am a rickshaw puller in 
	Jamalpur I need to know the roads of the town (more or less) and the timing 
	of the arrival of trains from Dhaka. I don't need to know much about the 
	weather or air pressure. Frankly, I don't need a radar. But if you are 
	flying a plane you need much more information.<br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In today's world, there seems to be 
	an oversupply of information. Most of the information we have is not always 
	very useful. There seems to be a culture of spam (unsolicited and often 
	unnecessary emails). In the United Kingdom it is estimated that more than 
	half of all emails are spam. Regular users of the internet (fortunately, 
	still a minority of the world population) are the victims of spam. Most of 
	us -- users of the internet or not -- are bombarded with information whether 
	we need it or not. The ubiquitous media quickly disseminates all sorts of 
	information. There has been a true media revolution. I was better off before 
	satellite television. I did not have to watch an elderly Palestinian woman 
	looking for her medicine in her bulldozed house in the Rafa refugee camp, I 
	would not have to endure watching the brutalisation of POWs in Iraq (many of 
	whom are apparently innocent) or the decapitation of US civilian captives. 
	My quality of life is often compromised by the sights of injustice and 
	inhumanity compounded by my utter inability to do anything about them. This 
	is another side of the information society. We have a lot of information on 
	what is going on, but not enough on what can be done or ought to be done, 
	and much less on how to do it. We lack a moral compass to navigate through 
	the thickets of information. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Secondly, I see a tendency to create 
	a one size fits all mentality. First of all, I see a difference between 
	knowledge and information. Information is a necessary but not sufficient 
	condition for the creation of knowledge. Information is the brick out of 
	which the structure of knowledge is made. In fact, I see three types of 
	society. Some societies are driven by knowledge. People have access to 
	knowledge though the majority may choose not to access it. Here, the US is a 
	case in point, where the knowledgeable sections such as academics, 
	scientists, doctors, and so on, are the most knowledgeable, whereas the vast 
	majority of average people are fairly ignorant about the world. And they 
	don't mind their ignorance. But that is OK. As long as the experts remain 
	knowledgeable, they can stay course. One of the attributes of knowledge is 
	that it is amenable to change. New knowledge replaces old knowledge. In 
	these societies, one has the right to information and knowledge. In the US, 
	the Freedom of Information Act is a milestone and a tribute to democracy. 
	The culture of knowledge and the search for truth make possible the 
	existence of Seymour Hersh whose articles in the New Yorker broke the news 
	of Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then there are societies that can be 
	called information societies. There is an abundance of information. These 
	societies value information and have created infrastructures for the 
	collection, processing, and dissemination of information. For example, I can 
	find out by the flick of my computer mouse how many people die of cancer in 
	Singapore each year. Or, how many people die of road accidents. I don't 
	think I can get the same information with regard to Bangladesh or Pakistan. 
	However, the correlates of knowledge such as freedom and access to all kinds 
	of information are still lacking in these societies.<br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh is neither a knowledge 
	society nor an information society. Ours is a &quot;gossip society&quot; -- a society 
	of stories or fictions. Let us take the example of date of birth. The 
	majority -- I will hazard a guess here -- of the people of Bangladesh have 
	fictitious dates of birth. There is a made up date of birth as shown in 
	academic certificates or passports, which is at variance with the actual 
	date of birth. Even for persons holding high office, we have seen different 
	dates of birth in print. Unless we believe in simultaneous reincarnation, it 
	is difficult to make sense of this phenomena. Maybe some parents invent a 
	fictitious date of birth for their children either to ensure a longer tenure 
	of job or more time for finding a suitable boy for their daughter. But this 
	might also mean delaying of pensions in some countries. Some Bangladeshi 
	workers I spoke to in Singapore told me their real names are different from 
	the ones they have in the passport. The death tolls of disasters in 
	Bangladesh are often imprecise. Ours is a society of estimates. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In many interviews that I conducted 
	in Bangladesh when I asked for information, I got a story, a fiction. 
	Sometimes, stories are useful narratives. Exchange of stories and sharing of 
	gossip are useful social glues. We can see the emotions, political 
	positions, and the power of imagination of the storytellers, but they do not 
	serve the cause of gathering solid information. Without credible 
	information, we cannot formulate viable policies. Governance suffers from 
	inadequate and imprecise information. This is another reason why our history 
	remains hugely contested. This is different from historical controversies 
	that we find in the literature of historiography elsewhere. Our penchant for 
	stories is unlimited. Now let's find out a way where stories and histories 
	can coexist without replacing each other. We need stories and gossip but not 
	at the expense of knowledge and information. </font></p>
