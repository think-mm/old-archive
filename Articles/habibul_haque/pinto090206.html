	<p align="justify"><i>[This short paper was written sometime ago when the 
	BNP government took disciplinary action against one of its own Member of the 
	Parliament, Mr. Nasiruddin Ahmed Pinto who was caught while snatching 
	auction papers. Now that the national election is approaching and 
	horse-trading for nominations is about to begin this may be of interest to 
	your readers]</i></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With apologies to the Saeed Akhtar 
	movie of 1980, I want to ask a simple question: Why is Mr. Nasiruddin Ahmed 
	Pinto, an honourable Member of the Parliament in Bangladesh angry? In the 
	movie version Naseeruddin Shah played the role of Albert Pinto and he had 
	good reasons to be angry about life. Our Mr. Nasiruddin, an honourable MP 
	also had good reasons to be angry at life in general and politics in 
	particular. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Nasiruddin Ahmed Pinto is a 
	poster boy of the new brand of politics in Bangladesh. The honourable MP 
	represents certain currents of our politics nicely. To dismiss him as a 
	muscleman, as a hooligan who was not even spared by the mastan-friendly BNP 
	government is the kind of public relations stunt, the administration wants 
	to pull very badly, especially now that the law and order situation is 
	worsening even compared to the last days of Awami League rule. It is only a 
	gullible who will fall for this sort of half-baked stunt. One really has to 
	ask a simple question: how is Mr. Nasiruddin Ahmed Pinto possible? </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not too long ago, Mr. 
	Nasiruddin Ahmed Pinto was made the President of the BNP’s student faction, 
	JCD to the utter disappointment of many of the genuine BNP student-wing 
	loyal activists. Some of them in exasperation set fire to their diplomas to 
	protest that choice. With hindsight BNP leadership should have heeded those 
	protests. If you go back few years back when Begum Khaleda Zia was in her 
	first term as Prime Minister, she publicly declared that her student friends 
	were good enough to resist the opposition party, namely, Awami League. That 
	was an open endorsement of student activism (read, hooliganism). Other 
	parties were a shade subtler. Student politics is nurtured by the leading 
	political parties not only to produce future leaders but also to harden 
	hooligans and “mastans” to be used for extra-legal purposes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The mastanization or criminalization 
	of politics has to be traced to its roots. “Mastans” (hooligan is not the 
	right word, here) always played a part in the colorful political culture of 
	Bangladesh. In order to take part in the political demonstration, fighting 
	the oppression of a colonial or an authoritarian regime, you have to be a 
	tough person. Politics in Bangladesh is not for the weak-hearted. You have 
	to be a Motia Chowdhury, someone who commands respect from her party members 
	for her uncompromising stances and yet not afraid to fight it out on the 
	streets. Since streets are an important part of our political space, you 
	need characters of strength to fight it out in the open as street-fighters. 
	And since not all politicians have the courage of Mrs. Motia Chowdhury, one 
	has to scout for some real tough guys. So it is not too difficult to 
	understand why political leaders of the major parties are favorably disposed 
	towards the toughies. But the trouble begins, when top leaders loose sight 
	of the difference between being tough and being a thug. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a huge difference between 
	one’s right to protest in public and becoming a public enemy. Respect for 
	law is the minimum the law-makers can show. When an honourable MP even 
	before taking oath as an MP rushed to the MP Hostel to grab a choice suite, 
	rather than official criticism, Secretary General of BNP Mr. Mannan Bhuiyan 
	had defended the act in a BBC interview by saying that those MPs were from 
	outside Dhaka and had no place to stay in Dhaka (presumably they spent all 
	their money on getting themselves elected to the Parliament and were left 
	with nothing to foot the hotel bill!). Mr. Nasiruddin Ahmed Pinto, one of 
	the first to grab a choice suite at the MP hostel, was elected from Dhaka 
	city. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Newspaper accounts of the occupation 
	of Dhaka University Halls (residences) also put Mr. Nasiruddin Ahmed Pinto 
	as the leader of such unlawful campaign. No eyebrows were raised. The BNP 
	leadership was guilty if not of commission (it is difficult to establish who 
	ordered him to take over the student halls) but clearly of omission. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most important element of a 
	successful democracy is a commitment to the rule of law. In Bangladesh 
	politics, there is a clear tendency not only to defy the rule of law but 
	worse, to replace it by the rule of jungle law. It is sad that the 
	successive democratically elected governments have only paid lip services to 
	the separation of judiciary in a bid to strengthen the norms of democracy. A 
	national consensus must be forged towards creating an independent and fair 
	judiciary. And this is where our prominent jurists such as Dr. Kamal Hossain 
	who happens to be the framer of our Constitution, and a person of high 
	integrity can play an effective role. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, the million dollar question: 
	why did our electorate vote for and elect Mr. Nasiruddin Ahmed Pinto who 
	already earned notoriety as a hooligan? Was he perceived to be a lesser evil 
	than his major rival Mr. Haji Salim of Awami League (previously of BNP)? 
	There was no allegation of snatching of auction papers against Mr. Salim 
	during the tenure of the Awami League. But he did have a checkered track 
	record that went far back to the earlier BNP rule. Why the leading political 
	parties of Bangladesh gave such individuals with such notoriety nominations? 
	What does it say about our political culture? I invite you to ponder this 
	question. I would like to invite all the leading parties to commit to the 
	principle that no known “goonda” or shady character will get nomination in 
	the forthcoming national election. It is time not only for Mr. Nasiruddin 
	Ahmed Pinto to be angry, but for all of us to be resentful and take some 
	part in the collective guilt. </font></p>
