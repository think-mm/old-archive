  <p align="center"><font color="#000080" size="5"><b>Does God Really Exist ? - 
  Some Thoughts&nbsp;</b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#800000" size="5"><b>By Aparthib Zaman</b></font></p>
  <p>There are always a lot of debates and discussions in various e-forums on 
  this topic,&nbsp; <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Aalaap/message/2262"><b>
  some of those</b></a> contain a lot of verbiage. But unfortunately those 
  really did not succeed in making any clear case, as far as proving the 
  existence of God, or refuting any argument against the claim of God's 
  existence. No surprise, as that's how it has been for centuries. The main 
  thrust of the article seemed to be that attempts to disprove the existence of 
  God is not scientific. Well, science is not in the business of proving or 
  disproving myths or beliefs, which are vague, ill-defined mental constructs 
  invented by human minds. Science deals with well-defined concepts about 
  reality that are amenable to theoretical or observational study. In the 
  context of God the issue is not whether it can be proven or disproven by 
  science, rather the issue is whether the term God can be defined in a 
  consistent way, that suffers from no logical contradictions. The fact is it 
  does not, all definitions inevitably gets into circularity, mutual 
  contradictions and all sorts of fallacies. (Readers are urged to carefully 
  review the following two articles:</p>
  <p>
  <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/incompatible.html">
  http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/incompatible.html</a>&nbsp;<br>
  and<br>
  <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html">
  http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html</a>&nbsp;<br>
  )</p>
  <p>As a belief it can be held privately by individuals, since beliefs do not 
  need to satisfy the requirements of logical consistency. But such beliefs 
  cannot pass the logical criteria to be a unanimously accepted notion in 
  academic fields. The only definitions ( if at all they are accepted) of God 
  that do not suffer from any of the logical flaws are God = Laws of nature 
  (Physics), God = Nature, God=Love etc. But those are just redefinitions of 
  existing words, and hence the existence or non-existence of God of such 
  definitions cannot be an issue of debate. Moreover such definitions do not 
  reflect the religious notion of God that human mind wishes to believe in.</p>
  <p>So before even the question of scientific proof or disproof of God arises, 
  the logical question of the consistency of the notion of God needs to be 
  resolved, which it has not been done in philosophy.</p>
  <p>Let me present the issue as follows:</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00ffff">1.</span></b> Has the existence 
  of God been proved scientifically? (Yes/No)? If No, then case closed. If yes, 
  then please provide the proof, or give reference to a &quot;scientific&quot; journal, 
  book where a decisive proof has been provided for God, as understood in 
  religion.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00ffff">2.</span></b> Stating some 
  scientific facts does not constitute a proof of God, regardless of amazing 
  that fact appears to human mind. So it is a fallacy to say that &quot;Since only 
  left handed DNA's are observed in nature, hence God exists Q.E.D&quot;, or that 
  &quot;Since Carbon has a resonant state that allows triple alpha process to form 
  stable carbon molecule (hence life), so God must exist&quot;. This is a non 
  sequitur. (See
  <a href="http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#sequitur">
  http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#sequitur</a> )</p>
  <p>The fact is no amount of scientific fact or data can be used to 
  &quot;scientifically&quot; prove God, because the last line of such a &quot;proof&quot; will 
  always be the statement &quot;Therefore God exists&quot;, which is not only a non 
  sequitur but also an unscientific statement of faith, not connected to any of 
  the scientific facts and data that precede it. Scientific language does not 
  necessarily make science: (See
  <a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/faq/faq1115.htm#SCIENTIFICLANG">
  http://www.positiveatheism.org/faq/faq1115.htm#SCIENTIFICLANG</a> ).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So all the volumes of scientific fact cited in
  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Aalaap/message/2262"><b>message</b></a> 
  (Some of those are inaccurate, but it would not make any difference even if 
  they were accurate ) added nothing to prove the existence of God. At the end 
  it remains an a priori belief.</p>
  <p><b><span style="background-color: #00ffff">3.</span></b> <b>The strongest 
  motivation for the belief in God is the argument from design. How can there be 
  creation without a creator?</b> This is a fallacy that results from trying to 
  generalize from human experiences to its absurd limit. Since we know that 
  humans are the designer of many objects that we see, so the generalization is 
  made that the whole universe is designed by &quot;someone&quot;. That is stretching 
  human reason to an unrealistic limit. There is no equivalent experience of 
  unknown designer of known objects to inductively generalize from into drawing 
  this conclusion about the ultimate reality. It will be an arrogance to insist 
  on this extrapolation of human reasoning from the known to the unknown and 
  unspeakable. So this is not a logical inference. It is a leap of faith. There 
  is no &quot;logical&quot; reason to insist that the whole universe has to have a 
  designer, just because we know that many objects we know to have human 
  designer. It is a logical fallacy known as <b>
  <a href="http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/logic.html#consequent">
  Affirmation of the Consequent</a>. </b>Besides insisting so would logically 
  lead to the insistence to a designer of the designer and to an infinite 
  regress. Saying that the designer does not have to have a designer would be 
  arbitrary, and a statement of faith, not logic. An equally tenable, if not 
  more statement would be that the laws of nature itself is the designer and 
  does not need a designer itself. At least we have plausible evidences that 
  point to laws of nature (Physics) giving rise to universe of space time and 
  matter (through nucleosynthesis and inflation of quantum vacuum) and life 
  through evolution. The emergence of living molecule from non- living ones, 
  although not understood, but does not rule out a purely natural process behind 
  that. All the intricacies of life and consciousness may quite plausibly be 
  built into the laws of Physics, and manifesting itself as the workings of a 
  conscious designer, But making a leap of faith to a designer other than the 
  laws of Physics would the case of fallacy of argument from ignorance (See

  <p>Finally I wish to respond to some specific comments in the above
  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Aalaap/message/2262"><b>message</b></a> 
  :</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Re:<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Ghoraar Deem&quot; theory is<br>
&nbsp;the most uneducated, idiotic theory anyone could give.</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As for the &quot;most uneducated, idiotic..&quot; part my response is:<br>
  <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-ridicule.html">
  http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-ridicule.html</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now regarding the &quot;Ghoraar Deem theory is..&quot; part, I don't think that such 
  a &quot;theory&quot; exists or was proposed. The point that was being made that just as 
  science cannot prove that Ghorar deem does not exist, similarly science cannot 
  prove that God as the object of a belief does not exist. That would be proving 
  a universal negative, a logically impossible task and is a fallacy to attempt 
  to do so. And it is another fallacy to turn around that impossibility and 
  conclude that since you cannot disprove that such and such do not exist, 
  therefore they do exist&quot;. This is called shifting the burden of proof fallacy 
  (see example 3 of the following link:
  <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/burden-of-proof.html">
  http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/burden-of-proof.html</a> ). It is the 
  (logical) burden of one claiming the existence of some entity to prove it's 
  existence to others to justify the belief. No logical burden lies on others 
  refusing to believe to justify their disbelief by disproving the claim of the 
  existence . Lack of proof of its existence is a sufficient justification for 
  non-belief. I think that's what was meant by Avijit, if not then he must have 
  failed to convey what he meant (At least to the
  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Aalaap/message/2262"><b>author of 
  message</b></a> ).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#000080"><b>Re:<br>
&nbsp;There are many examples<br>
    where the creation explanation is more scientific than evolution.</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is remarkable. Creationism is scientific? Beliefs have no place in 
  science. Creationism has not been accepted by the scientific community as 
  scientific, that's why it is not taught in any branch of science. An 
  individual scientist can hold creationism as a private belief, that fact does 
  not make it scientific. Evolution on the other hand is. Evolution is a fact 
  supported by evidences. No scientist disputes that. The only disagreement 
  among the scientist are in the theory behind the explanation of this fact. 
  There are various versions of the theory of evolution. But there is no 
  scientific theory of creationism, as Creationism rests on belief primarily. I 
  would like to see a specific example of creationism being more scientific than 
  evolution as agreed to by scientific community as a whole and reflected in the 
  journals or academic text.</p>

  <p>A refutation of the &quot;logic&quot; trying to prove a belief is not an attack of 
  the believer. If someone mistakes a criticism of the message as a criticism of 
  the messenger then he has to take responsibility for such a mistake. If a 
  believer has the right to gratuitously offer a logical proof of their belief, 
  then so does one who refutes such a proof. The use of the paranoid expression 
  &quot;attack&quot; has no relevancy here. there is no victim, there is no assailant 
  either. The same standard and criteria is applicable and is not disputed in 
  other cases of belief like Astrology, dianetics, homeopathy etc. There is no 
  reason to grant a special privileged status to religious belief. All 
  dialectics has to allow counterpoints to any points.<br>

<p><font color="#000080">I am talking about creating from scratch. Life is a mystery to our scientist.</font>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#800000"><b>My response:</b></font> Yes life is a mystery. But 
Mystery does not mean miracle. Aaparthib has already pointed out the mystery 
many times in various e-forums. To briefly phrase his idea, the best known 
scientific answer today in scientific jargon : <b>&quot;Life is a dissipative 
structure that has achieved the threshold of complexity to become an autopoietic 
system.&quot;</b> The purpose of life is nothing but to faithfully obey the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics by increasing entropy (Even eating, or even sex are dictated by 
this requirement, although our brain translates it into a sense of desire and 
pleasure for us, hiding the real underlying purpose from our conscious mind).</p>
<p>Now how life is formed ? Although a complete answer is not available, but we 
can expect to form a logical analysis about the creation of life keeping in mind 
about <b><a href="http://skepdic.com/occam.html">Occam's Razor</a></b>&nbsp; (Don't 
worry this razor wont hurt you anyway :-)). Moreover, we should also look into 
the sciences with all its modern insights for compiling our answers. Science 
itself is an ongoing phenomena, every day a new insight is being added to the 
knowledge based on checking and counterchecking that leads us closer&nbsp; to 
the final understanding. Darwin's Theory of Evolution, Mendel's theory of 
heredity and most importantly the almost legendary discovery of DNA and 
deciphering of the genetic code in 1953 can be taken as the quantum jump of 
explaining the miraculous formation of life.&nbsp; If we recall the famous 
experiment in the early 1950s Stanley L. Miller, working in the laboratory of 
Harold C. Urey at the University of Chicago, their result&nbsp; showed how 
chemical and physical process can create the ingredients of life. They did first 
experiment designed to clarify the chemical reactions that occurred on the 
primitive earth. In the flask at the bottom, they created an &quot;ocean&quot; of water, 
which he heated, forcing water vapor to circulate through the apparatus. The 
flask at the top contained an &quot;atmosphere&quot; consisting of methane (CH4), ammonia 
(NH3), hydrogen (H2) and the circulating water vapor. Next he exposed the gases 
to a continuous electrical discharge (&quot;lightning&quot;), causing the gases to 
interact. Water-soluble products of those reactions then passed through a 
condenser and dissolved in the mock ocean. The experiment yielded many amino 
acids and enabled Miller to explain how they had formed. For instance, glycine 
appeared after reactions in the atmosphere produced simple compounds - 
formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide - that participated in the set of reactions 
that took place. Years after this experiment, a meteorite that struck near 
Murchison, Australia, was shown to contain a number of the same amino acids that 
Miller identified (table) and in roughly the same relative amounts (dots); those 
found in proteins are highlighted in blue. Such coincidences lent credence to 
the idea that Miller's protocol approximated the chemistry of the prebiotic 
earth. More recent findings have cast some doubt on that conclusion.</p>
<p>Life is not simply an entity created from scratch from conception to birth 
(which you mentioned). Life is an evolving process that has been going on over 
billions of years in an incremental way. Life as we know it is a chemical system 
which needs both proteins and nucleic acids working closely together. Nucleic 
acids and proteins are built mainly from hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon 
atoms, which are among the commonest atoms in the Universe. </p>

<p><font color="#000080">Now my question is how this complex structure came in existence? Who designed 
it? Do you think without a designer human being came in this planet? If there is 
no powerful designer then the question is how this complex organization could 
assemble itself?</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><font color="#800000">My response: </font> </b>Your argument is known as 
&quot;Design Argument&quot; in philosophy. Design argument argues everything needs to have 
a designer/creator. Before giving a reply of this argument, I would like to 
request Sajita to read my following article which is a rebuttal of&nbsp; &quot;Design 
argument&quot; :</p>
<p><a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/article/god_design_argument_avijit.htm">
http://humanists.net/avijit/article/god_design_argument_avijit.htm</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now, the first, most common, and most obvious objection to the whole 
family of design arguments is the fact that any god which would have been able 
to create the universe would itself have to be rather complex and certainly 
couldn't be &quot;accidental.&quot; So, if the universe and the human body is too complex 
to be accidental, what about this god? Who or what created this god? The theist 
will normally respond by claiming this god is a &quot;necessary being&quot; and doesn't 
need a &quot;creator.&quot; Unfortunately, this is totally unsupported and totally 
unsupportable. There is no basis for such an arbitrary assertion, except to try 
to excuse their god from the same standards they wish to apply to the universe. 
However, any excuse made for this god can be equally work for the universe. Why 
can't the universe be &quot;necessary&quot; or not need a &quot;creator?&quot; No one can say - 
after all, we really don't know enough about our universe or universes in 
general to make such a judgment.</p>
<p>This is key: underlying nearly ever design argument, you'll find the 
assumption of ignorance of something and then the conclusion that s<b>ince we 
don't know, then a god must be the proper explanation</b>. But

knew, the watch might always have been there. The watch must have had a maker, 
who comprehended its construction and designed its use. Every indication of 
contrivance, every manifestation of design which existed in the watch, exists in 
nature, with the difference on the side of nature of being greater or more, and 
that in a degree which exceeds all computation.&quot;</p>

<p><b><font color="#800000">My response :</font></b>&nbsp; Your statement - &quot;Sun 
and moon's distance from earth is so precise and so accurate that if sun comes 
little nearer, it will consume the whole earth with extensive heat. And if sun 
goes little far away then life is not possible on earth it will freeze you to 
death&quot; leads us to recompile the &quot;Fine tuning&quot; Argument to prove the existence 
of god.
</p>
<p>The basic argument starts with a few very simple assumptions. We believe that 
anyone who accepts that the universe is &quot;fine-tuned&quot; for life would find it 
difficult not to accept these assumptions. They are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a) Our universe exists and contains life.</p>
  <p>b) Our universe is &quot;life friendly,&quot; that is, the conditions in our universe 
  (such as physical laws, etc.) permit or are compatible with life existing 
  naturalistically.</p>
  <p>c) Life cannot exist in a universe that is governed solely by naturalistic 
  law unless that universe is &quot;life-friendly.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The existence of &quot;fine-tuning&quot; in the universe (in the sense of various 
parameters being narrowly balanced to produce life) is well known among the 
physics community, theists and non-theists alike. But surely you realize that 
there is a world of difference between &quot;fine-tuning&quot; and &quot;intelligent design&quot;, 
and that the latter does not logically follow from the former? And the claim 
&quot;either the Universe was designed specifically for us by a creator or there is a 
multitude of universes&quot; is clearly a false dichotomy -- there are other 
possibilities, perhaps more plausible than either of those two.
</p>
<p>The Fine-tuning Argument only appeals to actual explanations, not to merely 
possible ones, whereas the suggestion about a &quot;theory of everything&quot; only says 
there may come to be a certain explanation without actually providing one. Let 
us take him to be insisting that we confine our attention to actual explanations 
and to be claiming simply that the God hypothesis is the best explanation of all 
those that might be put forward today. It is worth noting, though, that 
advocates of the Fine-tuning Argument have never shown that alternate universes 
are physically possible.</p>
<p>How &quot;fine&quot; is our universe is quite a debatable issue ( if the probability 
that a randomly-selected universe would be life-friendly&nbsp; is very small, 
then the probability that naturalism is true, given the observed fact that the 
universe is &quot;life-friendly,&quot; is also very small), however if really so,&nbsp; 
now question arises, does &quot;fine tuning&quot; necessarily prove that God exists? No. 
The considered position of scientists is that fine tuning in the form of the 
anthropic coincidences is real but that a creator is by no means the only 
explanation. Even if intelligent design were proven it would still not 
necessarily mean that the Biblical/Judeo-Christian God was involved which Sajita 
emphasising. Further information may improve the strength of the argument. For 
instance, if we find that our laws of physics provide an easy pathway to the 
origin of life that requires them to be exactly as they are, this would be 
further evidence for an intelligent creator.</p>
<p>The so-called other anthropic coincidences, in which the constants of nature 
seem to be extraordinarily fine-tuned for the production of life, are cited, in 
many web pages and religious books as evidence. However, no such interpretation 
can be found in scientific literature. Based on all we currently know about 
fundamental physics and cosmology, the most logically consistent and 
parsimonious picture of the universe as we know it is a natural one, with no 
sign of design or purposeful creation provided by scientific observations.</p>

evidence of other people's religious experiences isn't good enough. And notably
- a strong, compelling evidence is required, because the existence of
god/supernaturalism is an extraordinary claim -- and extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence. Personal &quot;spiritual&quot; experience is not
a conclusive proof to me. One should not overlook the fallacy of Anecdotal
evidence while any one attempts to prove god/spiritual being through personal
spiritual experience. One of the simplest fallacies is, no doubt, to rely on
anecdotal evidence to prove god/fairy tales/ monster/ghosts etc. You claimed
that there are many people in the Bible who had direct contact with God.
Similarly many hindu followers in India claims that their spiritual Gurus can
contact with god. Hearing their stories, are you willing to accept Hindu god,
such as Bishnu, Brohmma, Kali ?&nbsp; Actually Sajita, those who claim to have a
&quot;direct contact&quot; with god are just mentally/psychologically&nbsp;

years ago when they had no chance to even imagine all these things.</font>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#800000"><b>My Response:</b> </font>you see, you are among those
who always search science in religious scriptures. There are many
&quot;scientific&quot; books written by Hindu apologists who claim to find space
station, atomic bomb, test tube baby, robot, theory of evolution, gravitation,
unified field theory, cosmic egg, black hole, time-dialation everything in
Vedas. Muslim apologists claims to find those in Quran and you claim to find
those in Bible.&nbsp; Aparthib already pointed out those falacies many times in
various e-forums:
</p>
<p>&quot;Trying to find out&nbsp; modern science in ancient religious book&nbsp;
is just a flawed attempt that is often made by apologetics of all religions,
some more than others. If one likes to see science in anything they can see it
anywhere. Some Joe may have said &quot;All is relative&quot; before Einstein's
theory of relativity. By this stretch of imagination that Joe can legitimately
claim that he already knew about relativity and claim originality. Any vague
phrase, pun, quote etc by humans, scriptures etc can be customized and made to
fit any scientific principle which also have been phrased in a very general way
for popular consumption hiding the underlying precise sense of these principles.
<b>Its an insult to science and the scientists whose painstaking research has
helped unravel the complex workings of the laws of nature and reality.</b> None
of these scientific revelations were inspired from, dependent on, or utilized
any of the religious revelations. If religious revelations could not and did not
lead to any of these scientific truths in a stand alone way then by any
criterion and logic they cannot be used to corroborate science. There are many
unanswered questions in the basic understanding of the universe. Why can't the
verses of scripture throw any light on them? For example we don't at this time
know for sure if the universe is closed, open or flat. No body dares to make a
prediction based on any revelation. But if it is ever found out by science I am
sure one can dig out some vague words of a verse from some book of some religion
and claim to &quot;see&quot; the answer that science has finally managed to
find. <font color="#FF0000"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Its always AFTER
the fact that these semblances are found. It has never been found BEFORE the
scientific discovery.</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b> </b></font></font><font color="#003300" face="Arial, Helvetica">Is
that a coincidence?</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">We must realize that Einstein need not read Quran/Bible
to discover his theory of relativity, rather than, only after Einstein
discovered the basic fact, some of the Muslim/Christian interpreters made a loud
noise to dig some silly suras/verses from Quran/Bible to make analogy with
relativity by force.</span>
</p>
<p>&quot;Religion can never vindicate or falsify science. If Bible is really a
book of science then then what branch of science is this? Physics ? Chemistry ?
Biology ? Social science? Library science? Political science? No answer.
Apologists can only give the answer in the line of technological/medical science
relating blurry wordings of the book with practical examples of embryology,
astronomy, Big-Bang, etc. Moreover, if one considers Quran/Bible/Gita as a
super-scientific book then, they should be able to show us us at least one
scientific principle that is disclosed in Qur'an without using any mumbo jumbo
words and hocus pocus boring tricks of difficulty with confusing mis-interpretation.
The truth or falsity of a scientific principle lies within science itself. <b>Religious
scriptures cannot speak of any scientific principle. Religious revelations are
absolute directives and narratives for humans to follow as faith
unquestioningly. </b>Many revelations clearly contradict many accepted
scientific principles. No scientist of any repute have ever tried to
substantiate scientific principles by religious beliefs. Most scientists and
theologicians would rather not mix faith with objective and rational field of
science. Koran/Bible/Gita etc are not books of science. Any coincidental vague
semblance between a verse and a popular phrasing of a complex scientific
principle is solely due to the very general and vague wordings admitting of any
interpretation that one chooses to impose on it. All one needs is some vague
reverse fitting argument to connect the two. One can find Quantum Mechanics in
Tagore's poems, or relativity in the Buddhist Monk Nagarjun's writing. Just
seeing what one likes to see because of a preset belief in a favored belief
system doesn't make it so by any objective criterion. My purpose is not to
disrspect religion or its revelation, but to question the attempt to reconcile
the two in an illogical way. They can be irreconcilable and yet can continue and
thrive as separate ways as long as one does not get in the way of the pursuit of
the other. (~Aparthib)&quot;

<p><b><font color="#800000">My response:</font></b> I am not believing anything.
I rely on science and scientific methodologies. Science is not a belief / faith,
anyway. Believing or having faith&nbsp; in something cannot constitute a
knowledge, unless the object of the belief is defined unambiguously and then
verified objectively resulting in a consensus that crosses all
religious/cultural/ethnic boundaries. I am sure in your school days, you have
faced those questions in physics - &quot;How rainbow is formed?&quot; or
&quot;Why the sky is blue&quot; etc, right ? You certainly tried to give the
answer from theknowledge of physics.&nbsp; But, how much number a student&nbsp;
expect if&nbsp; he explains - &quot;Rainbow is formed .... because god has
created it&quot; ? Absolutely zero. Similarly &quot;God has created the
universe&quot; - this statement do not add any extra knowledge in our mind
rather than enforce to escape scientific methodologies and relies on (blind)
faith/belief.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;OH God !&nbsp; you created us&quot; -
illustrates the attitude of total surrender of the individual to the god of his
faith which does not require any further (scientific) investigation. Unlike religious
belief, science is not based on faith , but science is a genuine knowledge
acquired through scientific method through checking/counter checking . It is not
a dogma that clings to its veracity doggedly like religion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Big bang is not in a business to define the creation of life. &quot;Big
Bang&quot; is a model to describe the beginnings of the Universe. It is a model
of the Universe beginning at very high density and temperature, which expands
and cools to become the Universe we observe now. &quot;Big Bang&quot; which
conjures up the picture of some huge firecracker exploding,&nbsp; a gigantic
thermonuclear explosion may be more apt, though even that does not do the event
justice. There are many supportable evidence for Bigbang. . Edwin Hubble,
substantially building on initial velocity measurements of Slipher, determined
that the vast majority of galaxies are moving away from us, and that the
velocity of their recession is proportional to their distance from us. Therefore
close galaxies possess small velocities, distant galaxies are receeding with the
largest velocities. This is commonly referred to as the Hubble expansion. This
expansion would be observed from any galaxy, not just ours. Another supportable
evidence for Bigbang&nbsp; is Element abundance predictions based on the
creation of light atomic nuclei (eg. Deuterium, 2H; 4He; 3He; 7Li) during the
first few minutes of the Big Bang agree extremely well with those observed. And
of course, the discovery of background radiation in 1965, consistent with relic
energy from the Big Bang was a landmark finding that firmly consolidated the
model.

<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000080">And there is no other method to know the millions of
years old things. And there is no evidence transitional forms of animal or
insects or birds or even human being. Why we do not see any transitional forms
if we are evolved from other species?</font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br>
You have a very wrong concept of evolution. You said, &quot;Why we do not see
any transitional forms if we are evolved from other species?&quot; To clarify
you, Biologists define evolution as a change in the gene pool of a population
over a large period of time (not the short period like in front of your eyes).
One example is insects developing a resistance to pesticides over the period of
a few years. Even most Creationists recognize that evolution at this level is a
fact. What they don't appreciate is that this rate of evolution is all that is
required to produce the diversity of all living things from a common ancestor.
Even without these direct observations (direct observation is not possible
because no body has such a huge life-span to observe evolutionary changes, but,
it would be wrong to say that evolution hasn't been occurred. Evidence isn't
limited to seeing something happen before your eyes. Evolution makes predictions
about what we would expect to see in the fossil record, comparative anatomy,
genetic sequences, geographical distribution of species, etc., and these
predictions have been verified many times over. The number of observations
supporting evolution is overwhelming. But what you want is direct evidence that
is one animal abruptly changing into a radically different one, such as a frog
changing into a cow or apes turns to human. That's what evolution never claims.
This is not a problem of evolution because evolution doesn't propose occurrences
even remotely like that. In fact, if we ever observed a frog turn into a cow, it
would be very strong evidence against evolution, because it would then be
thought of &quot;god's miracle&quot; rather than gradual process of evolution!
</p>
<p>When you hear talk of evidence for evolution, the first thing that frequently
comes to mind for most people are fossils. Fossils that show intermediate
characteristics are generally called transitional fossils. Transitional fossils
are fossils that have characteristics that are intermediate in nature to
organisms that existed both prior to it and after it. As such, transitional
fossils are strongly suggestive of evolution.<b> There are many examples of
transitional fossils in the fossil record. Examples include large-scale
transitions such as from reptiles to birds (like the controversial
archaeopteryx) and from reptiles to mammals, as well as more detailed
transitions, such as those among the many hominids or the development of horses.
The fact that, despite the rarity of fossilization, we have a wealth of
transitional fossil data and that the fossil data generally conforms to the
phylogenetic tree is strongly supportive of the idea of evolution.</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Humans are also not exceptions. They also had to pass under the systematic
process of evolution. There are many examples such as ER 1813 (510 cc), Java(940
cc), Peking(915-1225 cc) ER 1470(750 cc) -they are almost or very near to apes.
And <b>even, creationists (Who think God created Humans) themselves cannot agree
on the point which fossils are humans and which are apes. ( <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html</a>&nbsp;
) This is exactly what we would expect if evolution had occurred. If, on the
other hand, creationism was true and there was a large gap between humans and
apes, it should be easy to separate hominid fossils into humans and apes. This
is not the case.</b> It would not matter even if creationists could decide where
to put the dividing line between humans and apes. No matter where it is placed,
the humans just above the line and the apes just below it will be more similar
to one another than they will be to other humans or other apes.
</p>
<p>BTW, Another popular wrong idea of evolution is&nbsp; that evolution claims
that hominid directly came from apes, which is not true. Evolution tells that
both of these species had the common ancestors.

  <p><font color="#000080">OK you do not believe in God and other stuff but 
  believe in science. Let me start with human body. Did you ever think that how 
  complex human body is? Every tiny cell that is not visible with our naked eyes 
  contains whole genetic information of the person. Every person's DNA is 
  unique. Movement of your body, cells are differently programmed to their 
  particular functions. For example if you want to move your figures, there are 
  hundreds and thousands of cells that does the job. And if you want to close 
  your eyelids or move your eyebrow, the cells are differently programmed. Only 
  a small alteration can cause it dysfunction.<br>

<p>Ok my turn. </p>
<p>1. Did you know human body is far from perfect? The bone that stays on the 
base of your spine has absolutely no functionality other than causing you 
tremendous amount of pain if you fall right onto it. </p>
<p>2. Do you know there's no need for the optic nerve and blood vessels to run 
across the frontal part of retina? </p>
<p>3. Are you aware that in male body the urethra passes right through the 
prostate gland making them prone to infection and subsequent enlargement of the 
gland? </p>
<p>4. Have you come across the info that human elbow has an appalling design 
flaw? At the knob on the lower end of the humerus the ulnar nerve is exposed 
just under the skin. Therefore, a jolt by a hard object causes a mighty painful 
sensation. </p>
<p>5. Did you know that human brain is highly redundant? A great mass of 
synapses exists in the brain without contributing to the memory capacity? </p>

<p>What's your definition of 'sharpness' here? If being able to &quot;recall things 
that took place many years ago&quot; is to be considered as brain being sharp, then 
you are *not* entirely correct. Provided no external damage is received, 
computer magnetic disks are more reliable than human brain, as data is more 
prone to be corrupted in brain. Unlike brain, information in computer disks 
don't fade away with time. A huge database consisting of millions of entries can 
be sorted through and feeded to users within seconds; human brain is hopeless in 
this case. Mathmatical computations in computer memory are way faster than 
brain. Yes, brain is more sophisticated in the sense that it can perform more 
complex actions and react to bodily impulses with the in-house conductive cells.<br>

<p>Subjective experiences like NDE (near death experience) or your dad's case 
(if that's not NDE) can not be peddled as proof for the existence of God. People 
have been reported to have communicated with aliens, dead people, dead pets, 
none of which are proofs for God. If someone is bent on believing subjective 
experiences, then s/he should rather prefer Sai-baba-esque miracles, which are 
at least visible and can be observed, than NDEs experienced internally by other 
people. Here's a mind-warping(!) experience by a Sai baba fan:<br>
<br>
&quot;Das Ganu once had an unforgettable experience. On a festive occasion, he sought 
Baba's permission to go to a place called Singba on the banks of the Godavari to 
have a bath in the holy waters. &quot;No,&quot; Baba replied resolutely, &quot;where is the 
need to go all the way when the Godavari is here right at my feet?&quot; Das Ganu was 
vexed. He was willing to concede that Ganga the holy river (Baba frequently 
referred to Godavari as Ganga) rose from the feet of Sri Narayana (one among the 
Hindu trinity of Gods) himself, but his faith was not deep enough to believe 
that the waters of the Godavari could spring form the feet of his master, Sri 
Sai. Baba who was reading Das Ganu's mind decided that this was the time to 
strengthen Das Ganu's faith. He told his devotee: &quot;come closer to me and hold 
the hollow of your palms at my feet!&quot;. As soon as he did so water flowed freely 
out of the toes of the master's feet and filled the hollow of Das Ganu's palms 
in no time. His joy knew no limits. He sprinkled the water on his head and his 
body and distributed some more among the assembled devotees as tirtha (holy 
water).&quot;<br>

<p>Ahem! Well, of course. It was more mysterious say 1000 years ago than it is 
now, it was more puzzling 2000 years ago than 1000 years back, so forth and so 
forth. The mystery is being unwound everyday, little by little, much to the 
dismay of great many believers. If you are intellectually honest, you'd rather 
put your trust on science and scientists than the vague, outdated verses of 
holy(!) book that lend themselves to myriad of interpretations, for getting a 
veritable look to mystery of life. In our life time, the look might be partial, 
but we're better off believing in partial but objectively provable facts than 
objectively intangible mythology of scriptures.<br>

<p>The gradual assembling of the elements of universe is perfectly within the 
realm of science, but what triggered that assembling isn't. But either way you 
cannot prove God's existence through falsifiable theory.</p>
<p>An important question would be: How did you come to the conclusion that it 
was the work of a supreme being, and not Invisible Pink Unicorn, or 
One-eyed-alien-pirates? More importantly, how did you even decide universe isn't 
uncaused? Your line of reasoning, i.e., Argument from design, is one of top-five 
popular arguments for believers, which has never been shown to have much basis. 
Now to see the problem with the argument, let's see the logical setup of it: <br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Premise1: If God didn't exist, life on Earth would be unfriendly. </p>
<p>Premise2: Life on Earth is friendly. </p>
<p>Conclusion: God exists.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Weak Antropological Principle, life on Earth can be friendly 
sans existence of God. So, there goes out of window Premise1. Premise2 isn't 
true at all, since life on Earth is not necessarily friendly. Thus the 
conclusion is unsound and should be rejected.<br>

<p>They will be in their respective positions so long as the Sun keeps burning

<br>
But why we concern ourselves with only Solar system evolution, when there're 
thousands of other such Star systems which have gone through the 
creation-destruction cycle. Moreover, the evolution of Solar system can be 
explained by Protoplanet hypothesis, which has more evidential support than God 
hypothesis. If God hypothesis is better, then you must show it through

<p>Atheism is not a belief, for God's sake. Atheists just claim they don't 
believe in God. There's a distinct difference between not consenting to believe 
in an entity because of lack of proofs, with claiming the entity doesn't exist. 
While the latter is a positive claim, the former is just a denial, nothing more 
and nothing less. If I challenge you to prove Invisible Pink Unicorn doesn't 
exist, you cannot prove it, can you? But you still won't believe in it. Why? 
Because nobody has ever packed you with objective proofs of it. So, to the 
existence of Invisible Pink Unicorn, you're an Atheist.<br>

<p>A negative statement can not be proven. That's a logical fallacy. You cannot 
prove there's no Green elephant, four-eyed zombies, alien pirates etc. [Ms. 
Sajita] &quot; Because you do not have whole-knowledge so when you say that, &quot;there 
is no God&quot;, this sentence is a lie itself. Because if someone asks me, &quot;Do you 
have candle in your home.&quot; There are three type of answers are possible from me, 
&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;I do not know&quot; Whole knowledge is never a requirement for denying 
the existence of assertions. &quot;There is no God&quot; is a meaningless sentence, so its 
being lie is moot. As for you candle analogy, the definition of the entity 
'candle' is properly defined, it's attributes clearly identified. Besides, a 
candle be observed in an objective basis. Now contrast that with your God - it's 
vaguely defined, attributes poorly demarcated with objective observation of it 
being an impossibility (at least so far). Hence, while the answer to the 
question &quot;Do ... home&quot; can be satisfied in one of the aforementioned three ways, 
existence of God cannot. &quot;No&quot; seems to be a tempting answer, but when Atheist 
say they don't believe in God, that's not what &quot;No&quot; refers to in the case of the 
candle analogy.<br>

<p>Standard young-earth creationist argument, refuted some 20000 times! That 
~30000 years come from the fact that the decay rate of carbon-14 in our 
atmosphere matches production rate, which in turn leads to the equilibrium in 
approximately 30000 years. But that bound is hardly refutation for the validity 
of radio carbon dating. Because the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere 
is calculated by performing same dating method on an object with its age known 
and finding |dating age - the real age|. To refute radio carbon dating method, 
you need to show the equilibrium is broken, instead of jumping gun on the bound.

<p>As for transitional fossils, we do have evidence for transitional fossils
