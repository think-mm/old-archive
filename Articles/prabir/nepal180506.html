	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</b>United Nations Development Program (UNDP) has classified the countries 
	of the world into three divisions.1) High Human Development, 2) Medium Human 
	Development and 3) Low Human Development countries.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	This classification is made according to the human development index. The 
	per capita income cannot indicate the real development of a country, the 
	reason being its economic disparity. Up to the year 1990, the average per 
	capita income was considered to be the criterion for measuring a country’s 
	development. But the fallacy was noted by economists soon. In the Arab 
	countries, a handful of oil-tycoons hold the major part of its wealth, while 
	the standard of life of the common man is quite low. So, now for 
	classification of the nations, data on distribution of income, education, 
	health etc. are taken into account.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Nepal comes under ‘Lower Human Development’ countries. Out of 175 nations, 
	Nepal’s position is 143. The king and the elite class alone hold a 
	tremendous amount of wealth, whereas the common masses do not get two square 
	meals a day. Only an eyewitness can fathom the stark reality.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<h2 style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">History of Nepal&nbsp;</font></h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</b>In the past, Nepal was a cluster of ethnic states under king’s rule. 
	Even before that, in ancient times during the Vedic period, a form of 
	collective rule known as <i>‘gana-rajya’</i> was prevalent. These ‘<i>gana-rajya’s</i> 
	were the centers of power. The heads of various ethnic states used to meet 
	periodically for discussions and solutions to various problems. These meets 
	of the representatives were known as ‘<i>Pratinidhi Sabha’</i>. It may be 
	noted that even today, these meets of the highest representatives of state 
	are known as ‘<i>Pratinidhi-Sabha’</i> (as ‘the Parliament’ in India). The 
	chairperson of this ‘<i>Pratinidhi</i> <i>Sabha’</i> was elected as the king<b>. 
	The post of the king was not inherited; the king was one among the 
	representatives or <i>pratinidhis</i></b>. Discussions and debates were part 
	of these meets. If there were no unanimity, voting was practiced. Social and 
	political power was vested in the hands of the elected king and the members 
	of the <i>Pratinidhi-Sabha.</i></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Even after a few thousand years, the basic structure of the democracy or ‘<i>gana-rajya’</i> 
	still revolves around the king and the <i>pratinidhi sabha</i>. The members 
	of the <i>Pratinidh</i>i <i>Sabha</i> still come from the elite class, the 
	aristocrats. The difference is that earlier, there were debates and 
	arguments in these meets, but not any more. Now the king has the last word. 
	And the common members are the king’s blind followers or sycophants. <b>
	Another point of difference is that now The King’s post is inherited from 
	generation to generation, thanks to the impotency of the members. </b>Now 
	the prevailing system is known as <b>a combination of ‘Multiparty Democracy’ 
	and ‘Constitutional Monarchy’.</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp; 
	This ‘Constitutional monarchy’ has certain uniqueness, the peculiarities of 
	which may not be found anywhere in the world. </b>Peculiarity no.1) The army 
	of the state does not belong to the state of Nepal. No.2) The army belongs 
	personally to the King. No.3) The soldiers of the army are not loyal to the 
	country; they are loyal to the King. No.4) The democratic government has no 
	control over the army. No.5) The king can dissolve the ‘<i>Pratinidhi Sabha’</i> 
	at any time, under any pretext or without any pretext at all. No.6) 
	Elections are held under the total supervision of the Royal Nepal Army. The 
	king’s favorites are selected as members of the ‘<i>Rashtriya Sabha’</i> 
	(equivalent to our Rajya Sabha). No.7) <b>This ‘Constitutional Monarchy’ of 
	Nepal is not like the ‘rubber-stamp’ Monarchy of the United Kingdom or of 
	Japan. </b>There the king or queen unhesitatingly signs the decisions taken 
	by the elected people’s representatives, unless in exceptional cases. 
	Rather, the King’s word is the last word in Nepal. Here the representatives 
	toe the line of the King, and not the other way round. <b>So we can call it 
	‘Dictatorial Monarchy’ rather than ‘Constitutional Monarchy’&nbsp; </b>(at 
	present, total no.of seats in ‘<i>Pratinidhi Sabha’</i> is 205 and that of ‘<i>Rashtriya 
	Sabha’</i> is 60) </font></p>

	Around 250 years ago, among various clans of Nepal, the <i>Gorkhas</i> were 
	the most powerful. The <i>Gorkhas</i> had a close relationship and 
	understanding with the British rulers of India. During the 4<sup>th</sup> 
	decade of the last century, the Nepali Congress Party put king Tribhuvan on 
	the throne. Since then, from king Tribhuvan onwards, monarchy is being 
	inherited through generations. After Tribhuvan came Mahendra ; after 
	Mahendra there was Birendra. After king Birendra came king Gyanendra.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	people of Nepal did not take the coming to power of King Gyanandra with 
	ease. According to popular feeling, the killing of King Birendra, queen 
	Aiswariya, prince Dipendra and many others of the royal family, on the night 
	of 1 June 2001, points the finger of suspicion towards Gyanendra. They also 
	sensed that the Royal Nepal Army was his collaborator and a partner in this 
	entire conspiracy was the Government of India. King Birendra was not in good 
	terms with the Indian Govt. for some time; his intimacy with China was the 
	point of contention. It was necessary to put a cipher king in his place. 
	This sentiment still haunts the minds of almost the entire populace of Nepal 
	today.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Since 1959 there were many elections, and many a time government was formed. 
	Within months, these governments were dissolved by autocratic rulers. Even 
	though the aristocrats were the ones to form the Government, and they were 
	over- eager to please the king at any cost, the kings lost no time in 
	finding fault and wantonly played their game of dissolution. </font></p>

	have seen so far, that in Nepal we have Monarchy, we have semi-feudalism, we 
	have semi-colonialism too. In this confusion, India acted like its guardian,

	is an Imperialist nation. Indian constitution, in its Article 1 (3) (C) has

	‘Parliamentary Democracy’ or ‘Monarchy’, by whatever name you call it, the 
	ruler of Nepal has miserably failed to provide food or roof, water or 
	clothes to the vast majority of his countrymen. The basic amenities like 
	road, education or healthcare are still beyond&nbsp;&nbsp; reach of the common man.</font></p>

	Despair of the downtrodden gave way to struggle for emancipation—‘Communist 
	Party of Nepal (Maoist)’ was formed on February 13, 1996. Chairman was 
	‘Prachand’, alias Pushpkamal Dahel. The ideological leader of the party was 
	Dr. Baburam Bhattarai. He did his studies in the Jawaharlal Nehru University 
	of India and joined the People’s War against the exploitation of the masses. 
	According to government records, 13000 people died during the last ten years 
	of People’s war. As a result of the combing operations conducted by the 
	Royal Nepal Army, many more were missing. And ‘missing’ means ‘dead’.</font></p>

	<h2 style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The Maoists Learn to 
	change their strategies</font></h2>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	people’s war, under the leadership of the Maoists was an armed battle to 
	snatch power from the ruling party. But about 3 years back, the central 
	committee of the Maoist group of Nepal took a few important decisions. Some 
	of their aims and steps were as follows:- <b>1)</b> To improve the lot of 
	the poorest of the poor, and to make these rural areas self-sufficient by 
	forming communes. <b>2) </b>These communes and co-operatives would be run by 
	commonly elected adult members of the community. This kind of democracy was 
	known as Revolutionary People’s Democracy. <b>3)</b> In this democracy, 
	natural resources like crops, minerals or the forest products were equally 
	distributed among the people. They learnt to live like independent human 
	beings and therefore, took care to keep vigil over the maintenance of their 
	hard-earned self-government. <b>4)</b> This kind of democracy, by its very 
	nature makes corruption and nepotism non-viable. The people who have tasted 
	self-respect and independence would not hesitate to identify and eradicate 
	any sign of corruption.<b>5)</b> People’s revolution can be complete, not 
	through armed battle; but through self-ruled rural development. In the 
	present day it is impossible to win an armed battle against the 
	imperialistic forces and take over the state power. But by successful 
	implementation of the co-operative concept, by forming communes and making 
	their own villages self-reliant, these poor underdogs can achieve 
	independence. <b>6)</b> So, the logical aim is not to ‘surrender’ the arms, 
	but to ‘control’ the use of arms. Arms would be for self-defense; so that 
	the feudal powers or the king’s army could not further oppress the 
	historically oppressed communities of this area.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
	latest revolutionary technique is a legacy from Venezuela and the vast 
	undeveloped areas of India. Everywhere we see a steady revival of democracy 
	through the rural co-operative movement. About two decades ago, all the 
	dreams to establish socialism were brutally crushed under the ‘brain war’ 
	launched by the capitalist countries. Despair had set in; any hope to 
	restart a struggle to bring about neo-socialism was a far cry. That was the 
	time when the Rationalist Association, to make the villages self-reliant as 
	a first step towards <b>Neo-Socialism</b>, offered a new thought, a new 
	guideline. In the line of Jesus-Gandhi-Rabindranath Tagore-Marx-Lenin-Mao, a 
	new concept or rather a brain wave of community living, of the co-operative 
	movement emerged. To make small, self reliant, self-ruled villages was the 
	new idea that spread from village to village like wild fire. We have seen 
	how the young couple-- Mahesh and Sarita dedicated their lives to spread 
	this revolution in Bihar. From one village-- forty villages joined together 
	in co-operative farming; started living like human beings. These villagers 
	were untouchable<i> ‘Harijans’</i>, detested and oppressed socially and 
	politically. They learnt to live with self-respect, had clean drinking 
	water, schools for their children, clothes. Now in India, from North Bengal 
	to Andhra Pradesh, there are some 4000 such villages.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	These poverty-stricken, illiterate rural masses do not know what is 
	‘Maoism’, whether it is food or medicine! All they know is that if any 
	method can bring them out of their vicious circle of tyranny, they would be 
	ready to embrace it. Those who are killed, raped and looted at the slightest 
	pretext, whose hutments are burnt down in a row, women stripped and 
	manhandled at the mildest of protests, at the hint of a demand for justice, 
	have nothing more to lose. To regain self-respect and get back their 
	democratic rights they are ready to take any name. <b>Their aim is not to 
	fight with tanks and machine guns against the global capitalist forces (they</b>
	<b>hardly know what that is!). Their</b> <b>aim is to regain human</b> <b>
	dignity</b>. For this reason, if the state develops a fear-complex, it would 
	be a shame; if the rich feudal landlords spend sleepless nights, the corrupt 
	leaders, ministers or movie stars get caught in the process it cannot be 
	helped. Now with the healthy competition between the visual media and their 
	positive intervention, nobody is being spared. No big shot with political 
	clout or money power can get away as easily as before. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
	the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Venezuela gave the first true 
	shape to a comprehensive democratic movement. It came out of its feudal 
	snare and improved the lot of its masses socially, and culturally too. Soon, 
	Brazil, Peru, Chile, Argentina followed suit in realizing their dreams. No, 
	it is not only a dream any longer. In accurate implementation, the masses of 
	these countries will show the way to the rest of the world. The people of 
	Nepal have rendered the leadership of the Communist Party of Nepal 
	successful by 80%. The remaining 20% is a matter of time. </font></p>

	November 2005. The seven political parties of Nepal turned their back to the 
	autocratic rule of the monarch and signed a joint memorandum of 
	understanding. These seven parties are:- 1) Nepali Congress, 2) Nepali 
	Congress (Democratic), 3) Communist Party of Nepal( Marxist-Leninist), 4) 
	Janmorcha Nepal, 5) Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, 6) Nepali Satbhavna

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All 
	these city-based political parties understood that without the support of 
	the Maoists they could not succeed, because in 80% of rural Nepal, Maoists 
	had a strong support. As soon as the eighth name was added to the erstwhile 
	seven, the revolution gathered momentum. The farsighted Maoists proved the 
	king wrong. Hardly could king Gyanendra ever imagine that the seven 
	elite-class parties would join hands with the poor Maoists! Now, cornered

	Countries like the USA, UK, India and the European countries are known as 
	the ‘Upholders of Democracy’. All of them reacted to the overwhelming 
	situation in Nepal. They all stood in a row in support of the king and 
	voiced their opinion against this historical people’s revolution. They 
	assured the king of sending their military forces whenever needed.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	China, Russia, Pakistan and Bangladesh took a different stand. They were 
	less enthusiastic and did not wish to interfere in the ‘internal affairs’ of 
	Nepal. In other words; their silence only meant ‘King Gyanendra, we are with 
	you’.</font></p>

	This overwhelming rush of the people’s democratic movement has gathered such 
	a momentum, that it is not easy to stop its flow at this juncture. With able 
	leadership and intelligent guidance, it is moving at a remarkable pace, and 
	the United States and its allies would find it more and more difficult to 
	gain ground and win over.</font><o:p></td>
