	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dear Sirs, </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have come to know from a Bengali 
	daily (AAJKAAL, 15.03.2005) that you are going to produce a documentary film 
	on one ‘rationalist’ Prabir Ghosh in which, the news says, he would be 
	portrayed as the General Secretary of Bharatia Bigyan O Yuktibadi Samiti 
	(Science and Rationalists’ Association of India) and a distinguished leader 
	of the science and rationalist movement in India. In this context we find it 
	necessary to inform you some facts about this person: </font></p>
	<p align="center"><img border="0" src="docu5a.jpg" width="516" height="312"><br>
	[Click for <a href="docu5a.jpg">Bigger Image</a>]</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. This Prabir Ghosh is little more 
	than a fake medical practitioner. In some books written by him, he claimed 
	himself to be a psychiatric healer, particularly a hypnotherapist, without 
	having acquired any relevant training or academic qualification. Some 
	relevant portions of one of his books are sent herewith which are in 
	Bengali, but may please be translated. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Hypnotherapic treatment 
	procedures elaborately described by him in one of his books have been 
	reviewed by renowned experts of this field from three different quarters – 
	namely Indian Medical Association ( West Bengal Chapter), a Kolkata based 
	professional organization of psychiatrists and psychologists called 
	‘Diagnostic and Applied Neuropsychiatric Association’ and Prof. Arup Ghosal, 
	Reader of the Department of Applied Psychology of Kolkata University. All 
	the three reports have separately but equivocally rejected Prabir Ghosh’s 
	special techniques of hypnotherapy as not only unscientific but also 
	perverted. All the reports are sent herewith. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. Prabir Ghosh has against him 
	several allegations of sexual harassments of his female ‘patients’ in the 
	name of hypnotherapic treatment. One of such ‘patients’ has filed a relevant 
	complain in a relevant criminal court under section 354 / 419 of Indian 
	Penal Code ( Case no C1268/1996, court no 1, Barrackpur Criminal Court, 
	North 24 Pgs, West Bengal, India) which is still pending. Relevant papers 
	are sent herewith. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4. Prabir Ghosh also engaged himself 
	in abusing that above-mentioned woman complainant with filthy words through 
	telephone, a fact clearly substantiated by a report of the department of 
	telecommunications of the Govt. of India and by a charge-sheet prepared by 
	the local police station. In this connection too, a state-versus case 
	against Prabir Ghosh under section 509 IPC is pending in the Barrackpur 
	Criminal Court (DUM DUM P.S. case No. 329 of 1996). Relevant papers are sent 
	herewith. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5. This Prabir Ghosh was actually 
	expelled on the charge of such acts of fraudulence and malpractice from 
	Bharatia Bigyan O Yuktibadi Samiti (Science &amp; Rationalists’ Association of 
	India) long back in 1996, and the news was covered by widely circulated 
	Bengali dailies . Some relevant news clippings are sent herewith. They are 
	in Bengali, but may please be translated to make them speak for themselves.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Regarding this expulsion, several 
	court cases are still pending in two different courts of West Bengal. So, if 
	this Prabir Ghosh is projected in a TV program as the General Secretary of 
	the above organization, that may not be entirely without legal and ethical 
	complications . </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We don’t know for sure whether the 
	news of making a documentary film on Prabir Ghosh have any basis or not. But 
	if this is true, we find it very shocking that such a person may be 
	presented as a representative of the science and rationalist movement in 
	India. And again, we think, such a step won’t even be compatible with the 
	stature and dignity of National Geographic. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, as a responsible organization 
	working for two decades in the sphere of science and rationalist movement, 
	we deem it our duty to draw your attention to the above-mentioned facts.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We would be keen to have your 
	response in this regard. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thanking you, </font></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On 18.8.1996, some members of the Science &amp; Rationalists Association (S.R.A.I) 
	&amp; Humanists Association had reported to all the newspapers published from 
	Kolkata, that they had expelled Prabir Ghosh from the association, on 
	various charges, on an unanimous decision taken by the members. </font></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Only 4 local papers reported the matter that, as informed by one Debasish Bhattacharya, Prabir Ghosh has been expelled from his organisation.
		</font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the whole conspiracy was instigated by a group of astrologers &amp; 
	funded N.G.O.s, and the matter was done in a hurry, without a proper Jt. General meeting or a Jt. Executive committee meeting, a Requisition 
	General meeting was called on 13.10.96. </font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the requisition General meeting, Prabir Ghosh was unanimously 
	retained as the Gen. Secretary and the conspirators were expelled from the 
		association. </font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To stop the above-cited meeting, the conspirators had asked for an 
	injunction from the court, but the injunction was vacated. </font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then as the next step, the dissidents filed cases at District court &amp; 
	the City Civil court, complaining that Prabir Ghosh was illegally working as 
	the G.S. of S.R.A.I. </font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The opponents lost the case at the city civil court. It was mentioned 
	in the report that the meeting dtd. 13.10.96. was valid and the committee 
	formed there was legal. None of the allegations brought by the dissidents 
	have been proved yet. (enclosure no. <a href="prabir_deed/Deed1.jpg">1a</a>,

		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Against this, the opponents went to the High Court and lost the case 
	there too. (encl. <a href="prabir_deed/Deed5.jpg">2a</a>,
		<a href="prabir_deed/Deed6.jpg">2b</a>) </font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Of the 4 daily newspapers that published the news on 19.8.96, two have 
	closed down. SHONAR BANGLA, later reported the news, that as per court 
	order, Prabir Ghosh was still the G.S. of S.R.A.I. (<a href="prabir_deed/Deed7.jpg">encl. 3</a>)
		</font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The 2 remaining daily papers AJKAL &amp; SAMVAD PRATIDIN have reported many 
	times, during the past years, upto the present day, that Prabir Ghosh is the 
	G.S. of S.R.A.I (encl. newspaper sample - <a href="prabir_deed/Deed12.jpg">a</a>,
		<a href="prabir_deed/Deed13.jpg">b</a>). </font></p></li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Registrar of Societies, in their certified copy of annual returns, 
	has mentioned the name of Prabir Ghosh as the General Secretary of the 
	association, and the address of the regd. office is 72/8, Debinibas Road, 
	Kolkata 700074, since the inception of the assn. in 1989. till today. (encl.

		<p style="margin-bottom: 20px" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">W. Bengal government has taken steps against the conspirators for false

		After the present incident in connection with Satyanand, some 
	astrologers and T.V. channels run by astrologers and also a few daily

	are dancing to their tune. </font></p></li>
