						<p><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath Tagore was the 
						greatest Bengali poet; there is no doubt about that and 
						none in the history of Bengali literature is close to 
						him when we compare his literary greatness and 
						versatility. But he was great and controversial among 
						some Bengali intellectuals of his time and until he got 
						the Nobel Prize in literature (1913). All of sudden even 
						his vocal critics became his flatterers and joined hands 
						in making him a demigod to Bengali people. That 
						phenomenon caused great damage to Bengali psyche and 
						thereby understanding of this famous poet correctly 
						became almost impossible. Nobody dares to criticise him 
						and flatterers expect everybody to accept Tagore’s 
						literary creations as messages from the Riga-Veda, 
						Torah, Bible and Koran all mixed together. They find in 
						Tagore the incarnation of Brahma and Jesus Christ and 
						worship him almost as God. No criticism please or we 
						will take on you, the threat and warning at all times 
						the flatterers spread relentlessly. Is there any 
						difference between these flatterers and the Taliban and 
						the Hindu and the Muslim fundamentalists? Readers can 
						judge themselves and get some concrete proves of this 
						statement from recent write-ups of some pseudo Tagore 
						flatterers whom we find in the cyber sites. In this 
						write-up, however, we shall try to assess Tagore, his 
						poetry, his triumph and his tragedy, if any, so that we 
						can understand this great Bengali poet as he really is. 
						I use the synonym “is” because a man of letters is 
						always with us and I for one respect Tagore for the 
						weight of his virtues and not for his vices. He was a 
						human being and one needs to judge him as a mortal and 
						not as god and this write-up in not to express any flout 
						to him but make clear some points which the Tagore 
						flatterers need to keep in their mind for Tagore’s and 
						their own sake. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">Tagore wrote relentlessly over 
						65 years. In him we find a poet, a novelist, a 
						dramatist, an essayist, a music writer, a composer, a 
						painter and even a singer at its best. Such a versatile 
						man is rare and that makes Tagore a unique personality. 
						His myriad mind created wonderful poetry, top novels, 
						dramas, songs plus many other things. But not all his 
						poems are world class, some are, we can not deny the 
						remark, are “post-card poems”. The reason is also very 
						simple. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">Tagore started writing at a very 
						tender age; he was young, had no experience and no good 
						knowledge for correctly understanding life. Tagore’s 
						poem got maturity with his age and he wrote many great 
						poems that made him a great master of the art. But his 
						poetry is not the very best in the world, comparing, for 
						example Shakespeare’s. I have read Shakespeare a little 
						and I am not qualified in assessing this giant of a 
						poet. Shakespearean language is difficult for me even 
						today but one gets hypnotised while reading his sonnets 
						and dramas. I still remember Prof. Munir Chowdhury’s 
						lectures on Macbeth at Dhaka University. In those days 
						reading Shakespeare was boring to me because I did not 
						understand that much the depth of that drama then and I 
						had to look to dictionary to find out the meaning of 
						many words in that drama. With time I learnt English a 
						little better and also develop some sense of 
						understanding, in my own way of course. I do not say it 
						is perfect or even near perfect but I can understand 
						Tagore vis-à-vis Shakespeare much better and enjoy both 
						but again, different ways. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath attracts me because 
						he speaks my mother tongue but I am enchanted by 
						Shakespeare because his every word, every sentence, 
						every connotation thrills me and I get enchanted even 
						though it is in a foreign tongue. Once I read 
						Rabindranath and I can do without it for months or, 
						until I long for reading Bengali again. Shakespeare’s 
						many characters are witches, ghosts, spirits or phantoms 
						but to a reader it appears real, and words from their 
						mouths sound genuine and true. That reality I do not 
						feel while reading Tagore, I find him inferior someway 
						even to Michael (M. S. Dutta). It is not quantity but 
						quality that counts and in that measure, Michael is 
						superior to Tagore. He wrote no post card poetry. This 
						judgement is mine and I do not insist anyone to join me.
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">Tagore’s novels are excellent by 
						Bengali standard but can we compare it with any of 
						Tolstoy’s novels? Tagore lacks Tolstoy’s depth, 
						profundity and understanding. Tagore has no novel which 
						we can safely compare with Tolstoy’s “War and Peace”.
						</font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">What about Tagore’s drama? It 
						could be thrilling to Bengali mind but it is certainly 
						not comparable with Shaw’s, quote one just as example, 
						the “Pygmalion”. After Shakespeare it is Shaw the most 
						towering personality in the worlds’ theatre. Shaw’s wit, 
						humour and perception Tagore could never reach. </font>
						</p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Shaw are 
						originals and nobody ever said that any one of them had 
						copied anybody’s idea. Unfortunately we can not say the 
						same about Tagore. There is rumour that Tagore’s “Gora” 
						and “Gharay Bhira” are copies of two English novels. It 
						is not Abdullah or Taj Hashmi who whispered it to my ear 
						but by reading genuine literary critics (and 
						non-Muslims) I learnt it while I was a student at Dhaka 
						University in mid sixties. One Kali Mohan found out many 
						Tagore’s poems nothing but copies of other poets’ works. 
						In short I want to say, I am not anti-Tagore, I read his 
						works and I listen to his songs. But why I need to 
						worship him and consider him the greatest on earth when 
						I find him, by my own judgement, not so? How many 
						non-Bengali Indian read Tagore’s books and listen to his 
						songs? Very little, empirical studies confirm, comparing 
						their (other Indians) fascinations for Shakespeare, 
						Tolstoy or Shaw, Oskar Wilde and many other European 
						literary figures. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">Tagore triumph in life was 
						winning the novel prize (a controversial prize one can 
						say). But I am happy about it and not proud and I do not 
						know how much Alfred Nobel’s dynamite money is good for 
						any prize. And I strongly believe that one need not be 
						proud for anything in life. I am not a nationalist or a 
						fanatic of any kind. My only fanaticism, if any bit of 
						it I have, is in seeking the truth and I will finish 
						this write-up talking about that truth that we always 
						need to uphold in our value judgement. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">I said that I am happy because 
						Tagore got Nobel Prize. It is nice that someone got this 
						honour sometime in Bengali literature. I have lived most 
						of my life in a foreign country; still I feel nostalgia 
						for my mother tongue. I can also say that I find poetry 
						written by ordinary poets in Sweden, Norway or Denmark 
						often expound depths and feelings that are enchanting, 
						amazing and an thing of joy. Sadly, I can not say so, 
						generally, about our Bengali literature. We are still 
						poor if not very poor in arts and letters as we are 
						economically. This assessment is based on our 
						population, we are over 250 millions, are not we? </font>
						</p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">I was happy again when Sen got 
						Nobel Prize in Economics. I am not anti-Indian or 
						anti-Pakistani and not even pro-Bangladeshi when I find 
						Bangladesh in the wrong side. Nor do I ever judge things 
						from religious angle because I do not believe in any 
						conventional religion. But I do not mind calling a spade 
						a spade and I refuse to be carried away by any popular 
						craze or daft fashion. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">Tagore’s life was a tragic one 
						too. Talking about Tagore’s tragedy I do not talk about 
						the premature death of his wife or any other member of 
						his family. I am talking about tragedy of his outlook, 
						his social, political and economic staunch. There rests 
						his shame and tragedies indeed. He was a Zamindar and by 
						all means a cruel one. The whole Tagore clan was like 
						that. They burnt villages because the poor subjects 
						failed to pay rent. The Tagore family or Tagore never 
						built any school or dug any pond for their subjects from 
						whom they earned huge fortune. Tagore’s poor subjects 
						lived along the river Padma and when he took-up the job 
						(of collecting rents) from his father, he increased the 
						balance sheet by 300%. He had even the ill and communal 
						mind to plan eviction of Muslim subjects from his state 
						and replace them by the schedule caste Hindus. Tagore 
						never tolerated any criticism or anyone opposing of his 
						views. That is what many said who worked in 
						Santhinekaton or had close contact with him. Tagore’s 
						religious faith was again a controversial muddle up 
						slant. He was a mixed-up man and he said many 
						hocus-pocus things that do not make any sense. He was a 
						reactionary communal person but unfortunately Muslims 
						community blamed Bankim Chandra more loudly and clearly 
						for that crime than they did against Tagore. Bankim was 
						a government servant (a deputy magistrate) but he was 
						anti-colonialist and anti-British whereas Tagore was a 
						British flatterer and rose to fame with their support. 
						If he had half of Biddhasargar’s humanity, Hindu-Muslim 
						relation in Bengal could have improved greatly. Men like 
						Tagore were responsible for many communal ills that 
						poison Hindu-Muslim relationship even today. Tagore the 
						man of letters disgraced himself by being a Tagore, the 
						communal Hindu. His “Brahmasamaj” connection was 
						outright duplicity if not plain hypocrisy. His 
						grandfather Dwarkanth, the fake prince, was a 
						collaborator with the colonial power and minted money 
						doing business with their kindness. His father 
						Debendranath all of a sudden became “Maharshi” and 
						Rabindranath himself a “Kabiguru” and indeed a communal 
						“guru” in Bengali literature. But one can forgive him 
						considering that communalism was part and parcel of 
						social life at his time and both the Hindu and the 
						Muslim community can be equally blamed for that. 
						However, we blame Hindus loudly because they were the 
						educated class when the Muslims were the underdogs. 
						Tagore again represents the towering personality of the 
						Hindu community and thus he bears the blame strongly and 
						vividly. But should we cry over it or try to hide to 
						make Tagore an angel? What for? Even his bones do not 
						exist today and no use possessing any grudge against him 
						now because he was communal. But need not we know it to 
						know the man correctly? </font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">There were many black spots in 
						Tagore’s character and we need not blame him today or 
						judge him by present day’s value judgement. In this 
						context I would like to say that Tagore, the great 
						writer of Bengali literature, was not up to our 
						expectation as a man and especially in his personal 
						life. That is a tragedy. But who says that the man and 
						the poet must be the same? We, of course, need to be 
						afraid of when contamination takes place between the man 
						and his literary life. Tagore contaminated both sides of 
						his life and was mixed-up or jumbled he got in many 
						ways. Muslims blame Bankim for writing “Bande-mataram” 
						and they consider this song very offensive and against 
						the Muslims. Actually Bankim wrote it hymning greater 
						Bengal (Bengal Presidency), he had no concept of one 
						India as that concept did not evolve until early 
						twentieth century. But Tagore wrote his famous “ Jana 
						Gana Mana Adhinayaka Jaya He, Bharat Bhagya Vidhata” 
						aiming George V on his visit to India. He was approached 
						by Ashutosh Chowdhury, elder brother of Pramath 
						Chowdhury, to write this song addressing George 
						Frederich Ernest Albert who succeeded his father on 6 
						May 1910 as George V. He was crowned on 22 June 1911 and 
						at the end of that year he visited India, being the 
						first British emperor to do so. The flatterers of Tagore 
						try to hide this truth and say that it is not George-V 
						but the God and mother India whom he hailed. Tagore’s 
						sin becomes very profound and dishonourable when we 
						remember that he wrote this song addressing George V 
						only 3 years before he got the Noble Prize (in 1913) and 
						most importantly, when he was a fully matured man. It 
						shows how poor his taste was and it is indeed his 
						greatest disgrace and tragedy. He became a 
						fifth-columnist by writing this infamous song. Indian 
						adaptation of this disgraceful song, how wonderful it 
						may be from literary point of view, is again a slur on 
						1.2 billion Indian people. </font></p>
						<p><font face="Verdana">Friends and enemies of Tagore 
						please accept history and accept the truth regarding 
						Tagore. You honour yourself and the great Bengali poet 
						by doing so. You need to understand him correctly for 
						your own sake. Truth may be unpleasant, truth may be 
						unacceptable or politically incorrect, truth may be 
						painful to swallow but truths prevail and truth will 
						purify your souls. If you hide truth for convenience, 
						lie will infect your body like cancer and you will bring 
						down yourself and your God with you. I wrote before, 
						Tagore will survive with his own virtues and not by 
						flatterers hymn or prayer and, possibility is there, 
						that ignorant flatters one day bring this great son of 
						Bengal down with their unqualified support and 
						disproportionate sycophancy and obsequiousness. </font>
