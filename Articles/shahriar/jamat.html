  Most national dailies of Bangladesh published on May 21, 2004, the gruesome
  photographic testimony of brutality of Bangla Bhai, the self-proclaimed
  militant fundamentalist, from greater Rajshahi area. Picture showed dead body
  of Abdul Qayum Badshah (52) of the Raninagar of Naogaon district, hanging from
  the branch of a tree. It has been alleged that Badshah was a member of
  Sarbahara Party. The Jihadi outfit, Jagrata Muslim Janata of Bangladesh (JMJB)
  brutally killed him and hung his dead body from a tree to warn the
  anti-fundamentalists of dire consequences that anyone opposing them.</font>&nbsp;<br>

  Such grisly pictures were familiar during the liberation war of 1971. The
  Pakistani army used to kill the Bangladeshi freedom lovers and hung their dead
  bodies from the trees. They would at times hung them alive from the trees
  upside down and light fires below to roast living human beings. Alternatively,
  they skinned them alive while hanging. Again we saw such pictures in
  Taliban’s Afghanistan. They killed pro-communist President Najibullah and
  hung his dead body publicly in Kabul. This was to demonstrate to their
  socialists and communist opponents what brutality the Mullah Omar’s Taliban
  were capable of. Now again after eight years, with Talibanist coalition
  Government of Bangladesh, we visited similar pictures of fundamentalist
  brutality.&nbsp;</font></p>

  Three days after the publication of the vicious picture of hanging dead body
  of Badshah an appeal was published in <i>Daily Janakantha</i>, under the
  title, “ Aro asankhya gachhe asankhya lash jhule thakar aggei kichhu karun”
  (Please act before numerous more trees have innumerable more dead bodies
  hanging from them). This appeal was a letter from Shafiqpur High School’s
  Head Master Mahmud Musa, a victim himself, who wrote as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL"

  </SPACER>
  “I am the Head Master of Shafiqpur High School of Rani Nagar Sub-District,
  Naogaon District of North Bengal. My home is also in the same village. In the
  last fifteen years I built this High School on own paternal property step by
  step, with help of education loving public of the area and public
  representatives. With persistent personal effort, and in my small way, thus I
  had managed propagation of education in the area. On May 8</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>
  last the JMJB cadres attacked and razed to ground my four roomed inherited
  paternal living quarters. This incident was published in various national
  dailies on May 16</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>, 2004. On the same day another
  seventy houses were razed to the ground including that of another Head Master
  and an elected chairman. In these conditions me and other member of my family
  have taken shelter in near by town. Before the tragedy of destruction of our
  ancestral house and leaving the village could be absorbed, the JMJB cadres
  abducted my elder brother (Abdul Qayum Badshah) on Wednesday May 19</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>.
  The next day they killed him after public announcement in the microphone, all
  over the area. Later they hung his dead body from a road side tree in the
  neighboring Baman village, of Nandigram sub-district, of Bogra District.
  Newspaper readers have seen this picture on last May 21</i><sup><i>st</i></sup><i>.
  I heard that these butchers are looking for me. They will probably kill me
  with similar brutality and display my dead body, if they can find me. I am
  also frequently hearing similar threats of life to other members of my family.
  Another brother of ours has stayed back in the village risking his life,
  because it is now the harvesting time. They have once abducted him and after
  torturing him in their camp have let him go. Our family has a well-
  established reputation in the area. Our family has a tradition of association
  with progressive politics and culture. My father and brother both were
  established in literature and social work in the area. We were also trying to
  perpetuate this tradition to the best of our ability. Probably that is now
  considered to be my family’s crime and mine.</i></font></p>

  The state of Bangladesh has a government and an administration. The country
  has a police and an army. This area has an elected MP, who is a deputy
  minister. This district also has a responsible minister. There are many human
  rights organizations in this</i> <i>country. There is a civil society. There
  is a government and an opposition party. I want to earnestly appeal to all of
  them and their sense of responsibility and conscience. I want to let them know
  that a citizen and an ordinary teacher is now dangerously threatened and is at
  high risk of life. Will you not come to the aid of this teacher, who is a
  refugee from his own home with friends and family, due to danger to his life?
  Will none of you feel responsible enough to stop this medieval terror? Do
  these goons who have destroyed my home and killed my brother perpetrate it in
  my fate to continue to see horrors? Those who are not threatened today, how
  are they assured that they will not be threatened tomorrow? Who is giving them
  this assurance? Their silence today may turn too dangerous for tomorrow. It
  may be too late then. I appeal to the government, the administration and
  conscientious citizen - “ Please do something”. And please do it before
  you observe many more dead bodies dangle from road side trees.”</i></font>&nbsp;</p>

  The writer of the above letter Mahmud Musa came to see me on 26<sup>th</sup>
  May. He came to inform me about the helplessness of his whole family. I asked
  him if his murdered brother was actually connected with the “Sarbahara
  Party”. Mahmud Musa said, “May be, but I do not know.” He stated,
  “Suppose my brother had done some crime, there is a government, a police, a
  judicial court and law. If my brother was ordered hanged after the judicial
  procedure – I would have no complaint. But who is this Bangla Bhai? Is he
  the court or the government? By which law has he ordered the execution of my
  brother?” I asked Mahmud Musa if there were any pending cases against his
  brother with the police. The younger brother of the murdered confirmed that
  there were, some. But he claimed them to be all false cases. For example he
  said there is a case with date of crime 30/2/2000. Obviously there was never a
  30<sup>th</sup> February. I asked him, what proof he had that Bangla Bhai’s
  JMJB had killed his brother. Musa said they (JMJB) have themselves announced
  and the newspapers have carried this in their report. Bangla Bhai’s 2<sup>nd</sup>
  in command Hemayet Hussain Himu, Jamat Amir (a leading position of
  Jamat-i-Islami party) of Raninagar sub-district. Muffajjal Hussain and
  Jamat’s former worker Abul Master lead a JMJB armed gang which abducted
  Badshah and three others. They have hung the dead body of Badshah on a
  roadside tree, the other three are still missing. I asked Mahmud Musa further
  whether they have filed a case (FIR) in the police station. He said, “No,
  not yet.” Badshah’s family is out of the area due to the militant acts of
  Bangla Bhai. He himself is unable to go back to his village. Additionally,
  police does not accept complaints against Bangla Bhai.</font>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL"

  </SPACER>
  Police’s refusal to accept complaints against Bangla Bhai is very normal. It
  is published in the newspapers that the Police O.C. follows around as
  bodyguard of Bangla Bhai, the militant fundamentalist leader. The district
  A.S.P., the divisional D.I.G. are also the protectors of Bangla Bhai, hence in
  the greater Rajsahi area there is no one with enough courage to complain
  against Bangla Bhai. Then he revealed why the fundamentalists were mad at his
  family. Their family is a politically conscious family of the area. Family
  wise they have been associated with left movements and he once was a member of
  left-oriented National Awami Party of Bangladesh. Badshah and Musa’s father
  Abdul Kader was a participant of the <i>Tebhaga</i> movement. Ila Mitra
  personally knew Abdul Kader. His grand father Sakim Sardar and great grand
  father Kasim Sardar were known to Rabindra Nath Tagore and had hearty relation
  with him. Patisar, the famous Tagore Zamindari, skirts Raninagar area. In the
  Ahmed Rafiq’s research paper on Tagore there is a description of
  Rabindranath’s friendly relations with Kasim Sardar of Raninagar. In their
  family they still learn and practice Rabindra Sangeet. They also have a
  tradition of reading modern literature. They had family relations with Ismail
  Hussain Siraji. The books that police party confiscated from their house
  included books by Aroj Ali Matobbar and Ahmad Safa. Musa said JMJB did not
  allow this year’s Rabindra Jayanti celebration at Patisar. They said, “You
  can’t sing Rabindra Sangeet – you have to sing Hamd and Naa’t.”</font>&nbsp;</p>

  Musa does not know when they will be able to go back to their home, destroyed
  by Bangla Bhai. Due to the terrorist activities of militant Bangla Bhai,
  hundreds of people have left the area. This has been admitted by Maolana Abdur
  Rahman, JMJB’s Amir and spiritual guru of Bangla Bhai. In an interview with
  Asaduzzaman Samrat of <i>Ajker Kagoj, </i>Maolana Rahman explained that in the
  greater Rajshahi area, in seven sub-districts, in this task of suppressing
  ‘the Sarbaharas’ they had active cooperation of Post and Telecommunication
  Minister Barrister Aminul Haq, Housing and PWD Deputy Minister Alamgir Kabir,
  Land Minister Ruhul Quddus Talukdar Dulu and member of Parliament Nadim
  Mustafa. In Bagmara, where their activities are at the peak, even M.P. Abu
  Hena is not opposing their action. They are getting full cooperation of the
  administration. He said there is widespread support among ordinary people of
  the area. In a short time they have arrested fifty people and found huge
  amount of weapons. More than five thousand Sarbahara have surrendered. (<i>Ajker</i>
  <i>Kagoj</i>, 13 May, 2004). The atrocities of Bangla Bhai, under the shelter
  of two BNP ministers, three MPs and Police has become so widespread that he
  has not been bothered by the arrest warrant ordered by the Prime Minister
  (before her departure for China). He is very safely and openly moving around
  in the area, without any cover. On May 23<sup>rd</sup> last Bangla Bhai’s
  storm troopers have marched in Rajshahi under police protection and displayed
  their arms. They came to the city riding on hundreds of motor cycles and
  mini-buses and submitted a memorandum to the administration. The police
  officers have congratulated the so-called Jihad of Bangla Bhai against the
  Sarbahara group.</font>&nbsp;</p>

  The militant activities of Self-styled militant fundamentalist Ajijur Rahman,
  aka Siddiqul Islam, aka “Bangla Bhai”’ are being published in
  Bangladeshi national daily newspapers again since April 1<sup>st</sup> week of
  this year. In August of last year, militant fundamentalist organization
  Jamiatul Mujaheedin (JM)’s members were in the limelight, when they attacked
  police to decamp with arms, ammunitions and the wireless sets. At that time
  reportage on their activities continued for about 20/21 days. In January of
  1999, militant fundamentalist organization Harkat-ul Jihad al Islami’s (HUJI)
  killers were in the news when they attacked poet Shamsur Rahman at his home.
  At that time Dhaka newspapers serially published story of their fundamentalist
  militant activities. But the present coverage of Bangla Bhai’s JMJB is more
  widely covered. The organization was once secret and after a few arrests –
  the reportage subsided. This time however the reportage is continuing even
  after eight to nine weeks and will not subside till fundamentalist militant
  Bangla Bhai is arrested and JMJB banned. </font>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" 
SIZE="36">
  </SPACER>
  In 1999 and in 2003 we were stunned and frightened to know the countrywide
  militant fundamentalist network of HUJI and JM, respectively. Like the
  underground tunnel network of a sly fox the network of these militant
  organizations are spread all over the country. The reason JMJB is getting more
  reportage is: HUJI and JM are not open organizations, but JMJB, is. Hadn’t
  HUJI’s potential killers were not caught on January 18, 1999 while trying to
  kill poet Shamshur Rahman, we would not have known about their presence in
  Bangladesh. Initially only three were captured who admitted their association
  with HUJI. Later, based on their admission police arrested another forty eight
  persons of which one was South African and another Pakistani. All these facts
  have been published in various national newspapers.</font>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" 
SIZE="36">
  </SPACER>
  On 24<sup>th</sup> January, 1999, <i>Daily Ittefaq</i> had published, based on
  an investigative report, that twenty eight other prominent artists, poets and
  novelists were on the hit list of HUJI. In a publication, <i>Afghan Atlas</i>,
  published from Nebraska University, USA an important research paper states, <i>“
  bin Laden has ISI’s logistics and intelligence support. HUJI and quite a few
  of Pakistan’s militant organizations have connection to bin Laden. HM has
  connection with Dhaka based Jihadi Islami, the organization whose assignment
  is to recruit Bangladeshi and Indian Muslims to fight in Kashmir.”</i> At
  that time the Pakistani citizen Mohammad Sajjid and South African Ahmed Sadeq
  Ahmed had admitted to police that bin Laden had given them two crore Taka (
  more than 300,000 US dollars) to build a Taliban-style militant group in
  Bangladesh. This money they had spent via 821 madrassas. (Reuters, Jan 28,
  1999).&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL"

  </SPACER>
  In spite of such concrete proof, police submitted such weak charge sheet, that
  the superior court criticized police for weak charge sheet. It has been seen
  in the last seven years that whether it is JM or HUJI – police arrested them
  when there is hue and cry in the newspapers – later they submitted such weak
  charge sheets that criminals were let go or released on bail. There is never
  any problem for them to get out of the jail. Last year the militant cadre of
  JM, who were arrested red handed with arms and seditious pamphlets, they had
  no problem to get out of jail on April 2<sup>nd</sup> of this year. The
  present Inspector General of Police has been alleged to be a collaborator of
  the genocidal Pakistani army of 1971 and the current Home Secretary is known
  to have a Jamat connection. Thus it can be clearly surmised why to arrest or
  keep in custody the militant fundamentalists or to judiciously run the
  criminal cases against them is not on cards for the Khaleda-Nizami government.

  Whenever there have been any allegation against any activities of the militant
  fundamentalists, immediately the Jamat-i-Islami chief and Industries Minister
  of the coalition government Matiur Rahman Nizami states that Jamat has no
  relation with militant fundamentalists. On last 24<sup>th</sup> May he again
  stated in a news conference, “Jamat does not have any relation with so
  called JMJB or Bangla Bhai. Jamat does not have any relation with Hijbut
  Tahrir, Hijbut Tawheed, JM or similar organizations.“ (<i>Janakantha, </i>25<sup>th</sup>
  May 2004). On the same day at a news conference sponsored by <i>Ekatturer
  Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee</i>(EGDNC) and South Asia People’s Union
  Against Fundamentalism and Communalism, Professor Kabir Choudhury said, <i>“On
  January of this year in Sylhet, at Hazrat Shah Jalal’s Mazar, there was
  bombing and five persons were killed. In February, the powerful voice against
  fundamentalism, Professor Humayun Azad was attacked with machete and he
  survived narrowly. Again on May 21, at the same Mazar of Hazrat Shah Jalal, an
  attempt was made on life of the newly appointed British High Commissioner to
  Bangladesh. In this attack another three persons were killed and nearly
  hundred were injured. Even though the British High Commissioner survived the
  attempt on his life, he is still in the hospital. Even though the
  investigative reporters of Bangladesh’s national dailies found a member of
  the coalition Jamat-i-Islami responsible for the terrorist act, the coalition
  government, in an attempt to protect Jamat, has taken no action.” </i></font>&nbsp;</p>

  The U.S. Asst. Secretary of State Christina Rocca expressed displeasure about
  the activities of Bangla Bhai, during her 3 day visit to Bangladesh , on May
  18<sup>th </sup>, last. She asked Jamat leader Matiur Nizami about Bangla
  Bhai’s whereabout. (<i>Janakantha</i>, 20<sup>th</sup> May 2004). Obviously,
  before coming to Bangladesh she must have done her homework on the related
  information and documents of proof in this regard. If Bangla Bhai did not have
  any relation with Jamat, Ms. Rocca would not have asked Nizami about this
  issue, since the issue is not about his Industries Ministry, but his party
  Jamat-i-Islami. No one else is expected to know better than Nizami in this
  regard. &nbsp;The chief of Jamat is an influential member of the present
  cabinet. Thus there is no possibility asking Nizami under arrest and oath
  about his party’s relation to JMJB, Jamiatul Mujaheedin or other militant
  organizations of Bangladesh. If such hypothetical scenario ever happens, the
  close links between Nizami’s Jamat-i-Islami and the Islamic extremist
  organizations would have been divulged in a second.</font>&nbsp;</p>

  In August of last year, JM militants had a clash with police and a few were
  arrested, Jamat as usual said they had no connection with Jamat. Again on May
  20<sup>th </sup>of this year, Nizami repeated the same story to Ms. Rocca. But
  in last August all Bangladeshi newspapers had published reports about relation
  between Jamat and Jamiatul Mujaheedin. When police raided the house of
  Montajurul Islam, the chief accused of Khetlal militant attack, the documents
  they found not only had distinct proof of Jamat connection to JM but also to
  al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Also in August of 2003, three books written by
  Maolana Masud Azhar were found in the Jamiatul Mujaheedin office in Jaipurhat.
  Pakistan based Jaish-e Muhammad‘s commander Masud Azhar’s name flashed
  across the newspaper headlines in the sub-continent in December of 1999, when
  Indian Airlines flight number IC 414 was hijacked. The Islamic extremists
  hijacked the passenger plane to Afghanistan with a primary demand to release
  the militant leader Masud Azhar. The Indian government was forced to release
  him to meet the demand of the hijackers. When he was arrested in India he had
  submitted in his deposition the following facts: He was born in Bhawalpur in
  Pakistan on July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1968. His father was a<i> Deobandi</i> type
  strict religious person. He joined Harkatul Mujaheedin(HM) during his student
  days and went to Afghanistan as a Jihadi per instruction of the organizational
  head Maolana Fajlur Rahman Khalil. In 1993 catching an Air Emirate flight he
  flew in to Dhaka, Bangladesh accompanied by Sajjad Afghani. Then he went to
  Karachi but Sajjad Afghani went to India. In January 1998 he again came to
  Bangladesh, on a Portuguese passport, to enter India. On January 29<sup>th</sup>
  he boarded a Bangladesh Biman flight to New Delhi. In February, on his way
  from Delhi to Srinagar he was arrested. (</font><a href="http://www.stratmag.com/issue2nov-15/kargil.html" target="_blank"><font color="#0000ff" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><u>www.stratmag.com/issue2nov-15/kargil.html</u></font></a><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">)</font>&nbsp;</p>

  At the time of Khetlal terrorist attack, Jamat declared, that the principal
  accused Montajurul Islam was expelled from their party two years earlier. But
  according to published newspaper reports Montajurul had applied for becoming <i>Roqan</i>
  (Jamat-i-Islami’s senior hierarchical position) of the Jamat and these
  papers were found by the police. While Police is not admitting publicly to the
  news reporters any connection between Jamat and JM, they admit that diaries
  found in the terrorist hideouts provide full list of workers and leaders of
  Jamat and Shibir.</font></p>

  The recent full day’s investigation has yielded that the building where the
  militants had congregated for training was owned by Jamiatul Mujaheedin leader
  Montajurul Islam. In the concerned area processions were taken out under the
  leadership of Montajurul, more than a months before the January 20, 2003
  brutal murder of five persons in the Pir place of Begunbari sub-district. He
  had openly declared in these rallies that they would oppose and annihilate any
  anti-Islamic activity in the area, soon after which the brutal murders were
  conducted. The absconding militant leader, was seen in the open, hobnobbing
  with the Jamat leaders and was also actively building armed JM organization.
  Many sources in the area inform that he regularly trained more than 100
  persons military and guerrilla tactics and warfare, in his private compound.
  Additionally, a letters have been found which clearly establishes Jamat and
  Jamiatul Mujaheedin connections. In this letter district Jamat secretary Abdul
  Matin Sardar had given Montajurul Islam significant number of organizational
  directives. (see <i>Bhorer Kagaj</i>, 2oth Aug, 2003). In all Dhaka newspapers
  including prestigious <i>“Daily Star”, “Prothom Alo”</i> and “<i>Janakantha”,
  </i>in their investigative reports have stated that the Bangla Bhai’s, JMJB
  is the open manifestation of banned organization JM. </font>&nbsp;</p>

  It has been noticed that whenever the government is under pressure from donor
  nations they ban the fundamentalist organizations and arrest some of their
  operatives. Then soon after the banned organizations and operatives resurface
  under a different name, with the same activities. The jailed activists are
  soon released, as usual. The jailed militants came out of prison on April 2<sup>nd</sup>,
  2004. The same day’s <i>Janakantha</i> carried the news that in Rajshahi,
  under police protection, the militants attacked and mercilessly butchered a
  person named Babu, who was allegedly a <i>Sarbahara</i> activist. They shouted
  slogans like, ” Nara e Takbir, Alla ho Akbar.” Since then for the next
  eight weeks, the news of Bangla Bhai’s of JMJB has been reported in Bengali
  media with clear reference of the organization’s link with Jamat and Afghan
  Taleban. The brother of Badshah,(the Hanging dead body of May 21), Mr. Mahmud
  Musa informed that Jamat’s Raninagar Amir, Mufajjal Hussain was in the team
  of Badshah’s abductors.</font>&nbsp;</p>

  In the long sixty three years of Jamat-i-Islami’s history, there is no
  example of any of their leaders ever accepting the blame/responsibility for
  any of their misdeeds. In 1953 Jamat’s Chief Maududi was charged with murder
  of thirty thousand innocent Ahmadiya in Pakistan’s Lahore, after a riot in
  which that many had lost their lives. Maududi was prosecuted, proven guilty
  and sentenced to death by hanging. Yet until today, Jamat has not acknowledged
  that they were responsible for the massacre of innocents. During the
  Bangladesh’s war of independence, Jamat-i-Islami’s militant wings like
  Razakar, Al Badr and Al Shams were formed simply to assist Pakistan army’s
  perpetration of genocide, which they did in the name of protection of Islam.
  They tortured and murdered the freedom fighters and intellectuals in large
  numbers, which were published in their own party paper</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>“Daily Sangram”.</i> Now,
  however, they say that they were not involved in those murders but Awami
  League was. I had retorted to this blatant lie in a BBC interview. I stated
  that if we had to assume that Nizami or Jamat were not involved in the
  preparation of the list of intellectuals till the last days of 1971’s
  Bangladesh liberation war, then we had to assume that Nizami was an Awami
  League activist in 1971. In that context we were supposed to believe that <i>“Daily
  Sangram” </i>was the party paper of Awami League. This is the same daily,
  which published vivid details of many massacres by Al Badr of freedom fighters
  with glowing tributes. And lastly, Nizami himself wrote many columns to
  inspire Al Badr cadres to kill the freedom fighters, in this ignoble
  newspaper.</font>&nbsp;</p>

  There is a commonality of purpose between the Nizamis and the JMJB, JM and
  other Islamist fascist outfits. Every one of them has a goal to establish an
  “Islamic state” in Bangladesh like the one under the Taliban in
  Afghanistan, with a Koran and Shari’a based law. Where is the difference
  between Jamat and these militants, in goal and ideal? It is now quite evident
  the main pillars of Jamat’s politics are: lies, deception and slyness. When
  Matiur Rahman Nizami says that he and Al Badr have no connection with 1971’s
  mass murder of the Bangladeshi intellectuals, or Bangla Bhai or Montajurul
  have no connection with Jamat – the lies became very glaring and
  self-evident. If every thing is false then why does police look for Shibir
  activists after the bomb attack on the British High commissioner, at Shah
  Jalal’s Mazar in Sylhet? Why did Christina Rocca ask Nizami, and not others,
  “What about the whereabouts of Bangla Bhai?”</font>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL"

  According to the psychologists, continuous lying develops into a type of
  mental disorder. Nizami is so much overtaken by this disorder that soon a day
  may come when Nizami would say, “I have no relation with Jamat” or may
  be– “I am not Nizami.” Nizamis may think that the people of Bangladesh
  are fools, as they perceived them in 1971. They claimed then that without
  Pakistan there would be no trace of Islam in the face of earth. In 1971, the
  people of Bangladesh, buried Pakistan, the beloved land of Nizami and his
  likes, to create Bangladesh. In 1971 also Jamat had a two member
  representation in the cabinet and they jubilantly performed all the murders
  and atrocities. They are repeating the story, now, again. Had any one in
  March, 1971 envisioned that the burial of Pakistan and Jamat would have been
  conducted only nine months later, in these very banks of Buri Ganga in Dhaka?
  The Dhaka of 1971 is now a metropolis. The progeny of the three million
  martyrs and this old city are waiting eagerly and are counting the days for
  the upcoming disaster of Jamat. </font>&nbsp;</p>
