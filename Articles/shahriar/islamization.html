  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the most recent reflections 
  about rise of militant fundamentalism in Bangladesh is the attack on the 
  police by “Jamatul Mujahidin”, in Khetlal Thana of Joypurhat district on 
  August 14, 2003. The attackers injured seven policemen including an on-duty 
  police officer. They also snatched away three rifles, some ammunition and 
  wireless set from the police. This incident evoked strong reaction in the 
  national dailies. From the follow-up news we come to know that this particular 
  militant group has spread substantially across the country during the last two 
  years.1<br>
  <br>
  According to the report of Government’s Intelligence Branch, there are 11 
  militant groups active in Bangladesh. But the actual number of militant groups 
  is more than the figure mentioned above. We know from newspapers that the 
  number is at least 15.2 Though it is not clear since when these militants are 
  operating, it is assumed that they started coming here in the ’80s. Actually 
  after the attack on poet Shamsur Rahman in January 1999 by Harkatul Zihad,3 we 
  came to know a lot about these sorts of militants activists from various 
  newspaper reports. <br>
  <br>
  Earlier Jamat-e-Islami and a few other religious political organizations 
  declared some progressive persons as &quot;Murtad&quot;. Amongst them are Prof. Kabir 
  Chowdhury, poet Shamsur Rahman, poet and social activist Sufia Kamal and also 
  a few other socio-cultural activists. And attack on poet Shamsur Rahman, on 18 
  January 1999 was the consequence of their pledges. After the heinous attack on 
  the celebrated poet, 48 militants were arrested, among them there were two 
  foreigners, one from Pakistan named Mohammed Sajid and the other from South 
  Africa named Ahmed Sadek Ahmed. After the arrest, these two persons confessed 
  in police custody that they had links with Osama Bin Laden. A police personnel 
  said to Reuters by quoting Sadek that by that time Laden had sponsored him by 
  providing taka 2 crore to develop the infrastructure of Madrasas (religious 
  schools). There were 421 madrasas enlisted so far for receiving the money. 
  (Dhaka, 28 January, Reuters)4 <br>
  At that time leading dailies published series of news about Harkatul Jihad’s 
  activities. It was reported that there are more than 15000 militant workers 
  belonging to Harkatul Jihad; a few of them were also government officials. 
  (The Daily Ittefaq, 24 January 1999). According to a leading English daily, 
  ‘Harkatul Zihad’ has trained 25000 youths during the last 14 years in 
  Chittagong. (The Daily Star, 28 January 1999) <br>
  <br>
  After the four party alliance came to power in October 2001, the activities of 
  the militants have been on the rise. Now the number of these groups is as many 
  as five times more than during the earlier regime. Earlier there were only two 
  or three militant groups known to be active in Bangladesh. <br>
  <br>
  From the recent attackers den some important information came into light. 
  Police recovered several books written by Golam Azam, leader of Jamat-e Islami, 
  named &quot;Islami Oikya Prochesta&quot; (Endeavour for Islamic Unity), “Jamater Rukon” 
  (Rukon candidates of Jamat), monthly report form of Jamat-e Islami Unit 
  Organization, monthly magazine &quot;Prithiby” and other documents. Among the 
  confiscated books some are written by Maolana Masud Azhar, commander of 
  Pakistan-based militant organization “Jaishe Muhammad”,5 such as “Shasatra 
  Pahara”(Armed Vigilance), &quot;Keno Zihad Korbo&quot; (Why We’ll Crusade), &quot;Zihader 
  Chollish Hadis&quot; (Forty Hadis of Zihad), “Jihader Artha Joy” (Meaning of Jihad 
  is Victory), Monthly “Al Mujahid&quot;, dairy 2003 of “Islami Chattra Shibir” 
  (Student front of Jamat-e Islami), etc. (Daily Sangbad, Bhorer Kagoj, Prothom 
  Alo, 27 August 2003) <br>
  <br>
  Like any other militant attacks, police initially showed alertness about this 
  incident and arrested some culprits but gradually they became inactive because 
  of pressure from certain influential quarters. At Khetlal though police 
  arrested some militants, reports about the farcical way they were interrogated 
  also came out in newspapers. A local police officer said to journalists¾ 
  &quot;Whenever we started asking questions to them, they uttered ‘Allahu Akbar, 
  Allahu Akbar’. As a Muslim what could I do then?&quot; (Daily Sangbad, Ajker Kagoj, 
  20 August 2003) <br>
  <br>
  Jamat-e-Islami, a major partner of the ruling coalition, often seems stronger 
  than BNP, because a number of accused militants linked with Jamat-e-Islami are 
  freed after being arrested or the case is deliberately made weak or 
  investigation is stopped for ‘lack of evidence’. In February 2003 there was a 
  bomb explosion in Panchagar of Dinajpur District. Those involved in the 
  incident confessed their link with Jamat-e-Islami. This time also newspapers 
  mentioned that those arrested in the incident of Khetlal for attacking police 
  had connection with Jamat-e-Islami.6 As usual, leaders of Jamat-e-Islami 
  denied any sort of involvement with these militants. Nowadays Jamat-e-Islami 
  leaders even don’t want to acknowledge their anti-Bangladesh role in 1971. 
  During the war they formed killing squads like Razakar, Al Badar, Al Shams and 
  helped the then Pakistani occupation army to commit genocide and to violate 
  women. Some of them also took part in the atrocities actively. By going 
  through newspapers from 16 August (2001) to 31th August (2003), it is found 
  that nobody from Jamat-e-Islami was arrested in connection with militancy. The 
  administration does not seem to have enough power to arrest them. On August 18 
  (2003), ‘Bhorer Kagoj’ published a report under the heading &quot;Activists of 
  Jamat Shibir can kill with impunity &quot;; it said &quot; police can’t keep them under 
  arrest because most of the accused are members of Jamat-e-Islami&quot;. On August 
  17, (2003) ‘Janakantha’ published a similar report under the heading of &quot;Why 
  are militants freed so frequently’’. On August 18, ‘Prothom Alo’ wrote, 
  &quot;Militants are allowed to go scot free&quot;. All the reports mentioned that 
  militants are getting impunity because of their involvement with Jamat-e 
  Islami. <br>
  <br>
  During former government some militant fundamentalists were brought to book 
  but now under this government they are enjoying all sorts of protection from 
  the government. After coming to power this (coalition) government is playing 
  the same-recorded tape ad nauseam that there are no fundamentalists in the 
  four party coalition, and there are no fundamentalists in Bangladesh. They are 
  not satisfied even with this. They are arresting those people who say that 
  within the government there are fundamentalists even though some leaders of 
  the four party coalition said earlier that they were followers of Laden and 
  Taliban. Even in public meetings they chanted such slogan as ‘We are all 
  Taliban, Bangladesh will become Afghanistan’. If the leaders of four party 
  alliance openly utter such words, what can police do to those who attack on 
  them or to the militants who are undaunted. <br>
  <br>
  Home minister Altaf Hosaain Chowdhury said the attack on police in Joypurhat 
  by Jamatul Mujahidin was an isolated incident. But the Minister in charge of 
  the District said, &quot;Jamatul Mujahidin is trying to overthrow the government. 
  They can do anything (else)&quot;. (Sangbad, Bhorer Kagoj, 26 August 2003) <br>
  <br>
  The objective of Islamic militants is to establish Islamic rule in Bangladesh. 
  They want to destroy all that is against Islam in their eyes. After the 
  parliamentary election of 1 October 2001, non-Muslims are being systematically 
  oppressed. The main opposition party Awami League has been added to the list 
  of the oppressed along with members of the religious and ethnic minorities and 
  secular-minded intellectuals. Those members of Hindu community, who cast votes 
  for BNP in the last elections, even they are not spared from oppression. To 
  give an example¾ one of the most highlighted incident of Purnima's family in 
  Sirajgonj. Purnima, a minor girl was gang raped by the cadres of BNP. 
  Purnima’s mother told the attackers that she voted for BNP, but she and her 
  family members were not spared. <br>
  <br>
  The four party alliance government headed by Khaleda-Nijami is always refusing 
  to admit any communal violence in the country. They say the daily newspapers 
  are publishing fabricated, distorted and exaggerated news. In the last 22 
  months, Hindu community members suffered so much that quite a number of them 
  already compelled to leave the country. <br>
  Some think that the news of communal onslaught nowadays is less than before, 
  so the communal situation has improved. But regular minority oppression is 
  still going on, particularly in the remote areas. Newspapers don’t get all 
  news of these incidents because: <br>
  <br>
  (1) Victims know it is meaningless to file case against oppressors or some 
  times apprehending more oppression they don’t go to Police Station. If any 
  case of repression is not filed in Police Station, local journalists hardly 
  pay heed to it. <br>
  (2) Those who go to Police Station to file cases are not received properly, 
  especially in the case of rape. <br>
  (3) The gangsters of ruling political parties often attack the local 
  journalists who send such news to newspapers and are harassed by the 
  administration. <br>
  (4) If a minority family is repeatedly victimized, such news doesn’t come to 
  newspapers as being monotonous. <br>
  (5) Those papers that once elaborately published the news of minority 
  oppression, now don’t do that for fear of loosing government advertisement and 
  sometimes because of pressures/ threats by government. <br>
  <br>
  We investigated some largely minority populated areas and found that the 
  nature of oppression had somewhat changed but it was still going on. It is 
  true that now generally minority people are not oppressed physically but 
  mental torture and extortion is still continuing. Now minority people are 
  told: (A) It is a Muslim country, here non-Muslims can’t live. If they want to 
  live they have to pay money and they won’t be allowed to apply their franchise 
  independently.<br>
  <br>
  Due to the influence of militant fundamentalists over political, social, 
  economical spheres, our age old-tradition of communal harmony and humane 
  values are on the verge of extinction. Our goal of independence could not be 
  achieved for the gradual rise of fundamentalism by directly patronized by 
  ruling parties. The rise of fundamentalism and communalism here in Bangladesh 
  would affect other neighboring countries too. In our sub-continent all the 
  fundamentalists¾ either Muslim or Hindu have same objectives; their target is 
  to destroy secular democracy and to set up theology based government. <br>
  Now it is the high time to protect our country from pseudo-Islamization or 
  Talibanization. We need to unite all secular minded persons &amp; organizations to 
  save the country’s sovereignty and to protect the spirit of independence. We 
  should not forget that today the fundamentalists here are gaining strength 
  taking the advantage of our weakness, that is discord among secular democratic 
  forces. They are also getting support from Pakistan and some Middle Eastern 
  countries. We, who believe in secular democracy can’t accept the rise of 
  fundamentalism linked with terrorism by watching it like silent spectators.
  <br>
  We know that there are differences among the political parties in the matter 
  related to gaining state power. The leftists themselves have different 
  opinions on different issues within themselves, which is natural. But now we 
  all should stand against fundamentalists not separately but unitedly like the 
  1971 war of liberation. In 1992 under the leadership of Jahanara Imam we 
  united and rocked the base of fundamentalists, but we could not sustain the 
  wave longer. Why we failed to keep that movement truly alive is a question. 
  But if we waste our time by debating on these issues that would not bring any 
  fruit. <br>
  Today’s round table discussion is an appeal to all the pro-liberation forces, 
  especially political leaders, to come forward to protect our country from the 
  clutches of anti-democratic, fascist, fundamentalist and communal forces. We 
  have to fight against all kind of fundamentalism and communalism in order to 
  preserve secular democracy and humane values, so that our coming generation 
  can live in peace and enjoy equal rights, freedom, social justice and dignity 
  in true sense.</font></p>

    leaders and activists from the confiscated diary. They also found some 
    leaflets of Abbas Ali Khan, former Amir of Jamat, letters &amp; receipts of 
    subscription collection. Besides, a lot of literatures of Jamat-Shibirs were
