	<b>OP-ed :</b> <b><font color="#800000">More Trade, Less Poverty</font></b><br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	By SUSAN SCHWAB<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<i>Economists have determined over and over again that the more ambitious 
	the opening of trade flows, the greater the results.<br>
	</i>&nbsp;<br>
	<b>SAN-Feature Service : -</b> The atmosphere is charged with political 
	pressure and historical significance as trade ministers and negotiators 
	representing World Trade Organization members gather this week. With time 
	running out for a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round, 
	speculation has intensified about what the U.S. and other WTO members will 
	be willing to do to achieve success. I reaffirm here that the U.S. is 
	committed to an ambitious and comprehensive outcome by the end of the year. 
	As President Bush declared last week at the U.S.-EU summit, the Doha Round 
	is too important to fail.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We regard it as our generation's opportunity to attack the 
	scourge of poverty by opening trade flows between all nations in 
	agricultural goods, industrial products and services. Half-measures that 
	would leave millions in poverty -- people who might otherwise have been 
	helped -- and that would dampen potential economic opportunities for people 
	in all countries, should not be acceptable.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economists have determined over and over again that the more 
	ambitious the opening of trade flows, the greater the results. The data also 
	make it clear that the most effective way for developed countries to assist 
	developing countries through trade is to lower agricultural tariffs.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier this month, the Organization for Economic 
	Cooperation and Development issued a study that looked at the impact of 50 
	percent cuts in tariffs, agricultural export subsidies, and domestic support 
	programs of OECD countries. The study concluded that this degree of trade 
	liberalization in agricultural goods alone would account for 59 percent of 
	the total potential global economic gains from expanded trade in all types 
	of goods.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But more importantly, the OECD study, like a comparable World 
	Bank study, concluded that market access -- meaning tariff cuts -- accounted 
	for the lion's share, or nearly 79 percent, of the potential benefits of 
	agricultural trade liberalization. These and other studies have buttressed 
	U.S. determination to keep WTO members focused on making meaningful 
	improvements in agricultural market access. Simply stated, that is where the 
	gains are for developing countries.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, expanded market access is not solely the burden of 
	developed countries. Developing countries, particularly the more advanced 
	developing countries, must also muster the political will to bring down 
	barriers. This applies across all sectors as well. As important as 
	agriculture is to the Doha Round negotiations, we must remember that 75 
	percent of annual global trade is in manufactured goods.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The record on how trade can spur development is compelling. 
	The World Bank has estimated that, in the 1990s, per capita real income grew 
	three times faster for developing countries that significantly lowered trade 
	barriers (5 percent) than for other developing countries that lowered 
	barriers less (1.4 percent). Just as important, the income gains were 
	enjoyed by people at all income levels.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The World Bank also estimates that eliminating trade barriers 
	in goods alone (not including trade in the rapidly growing services sector), 
	could boost incomes in developing countries by at least $142 billion a year. 
	That figure exceeds the combined total of $80 billion in foreign economic 
	assistance by G-7 countries last year and a current G-7 proposal for $42 
	billion for developing country debt relief. Right now, around 70 percent of 
	the duties on goods that developing countries pay go to other developing 
	countries. The only way for the development potential so clearly evidenced 
	by the World Bank studies to be realized is for these tariffs to come down 
	to promote further South-South trade.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States put forward an offer last fall to make meaningful 
	cuts in trade-distorting domestic agricultural supports if other countries 
	would reciprocate with deep cuts in tariffs and trade-distorting domestic 
	support. So far, our trading partners have not matched our ambition -- but 
	it is not too late.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; Multilateral trade rounds over the last 60 years have led us to this 
	week. The need for meaningful trade liberalization has never been greater 
	and the potential benefits of expanded trade have never been more compelling<b><i>.---SAN-Feature
