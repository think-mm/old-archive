	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fire has had the fascination for man 
	from time immemorial. We can say that civilisation of mankind began with the 
	discovery of fire and cooking. Fire can be useful as well as destructive. 
	For whatever purpose it may be used, man has not lost his awe for fire. So, 
	if one demonstrates that fire does not burn him or her, others will have to 
	come to the conclusion that that person has supernatural powers. This 
	gullibility of man has been exploited by charlatans, quacks, pseudo 
	scientists and those of their ilk. The so called miracles performed with 
	fire vary from performing arathi with lit camphor on one's palm to dancing 
	or walking on embers. It may vary from plunging one's hand into molten lead 
	to licking red hot iron implements. The scenarios in which so called 
	miracles are performed may be a 'bhootha kola' in a remote village to a five 
	star hotel. From a Moharrum procession to a 'coming of age ceremony' in an 
	African tribe. How can so called miracles be performed? Let us analyse them. 
	One of the most common type is performing arathi, with lit camphor on one's 
	palm or the tongue. Firstly, one has to examine the camphor that is used. A 
	thick piece, about 5 mm in thickness, is used. It is placed first on one 
	palm and lit. When the camphor gets hot, it is transferred to the other. 
	When it gets too warm for either of the palms, it is placed on the tongue 
	and the mouth closed when it gets extinguished! Here, one makes use of the 
	few well known properties of camphor. One is that camphor is a unique 
	substance which sublimates - that is, it passes directly from the solid to 
	vapour state - there is no in term-ediate liquid state. SO-, there is no 
	danger of the melted camphor running down one's palm or the throat! The 
	camphor being a good insulator takes some time for the heat to pass to the 
	lower portion. This particular 'miracle' with camphor has a number of 
	applications! In parts of Karnataka, if a person shows any signs of mental 
	illness, spirit possession has to be ruled out! That is done by placing a 
	piece of lit camphor on the palm of the patient. If the skin is burnt, it is 
	assumed that there is no spirit possession and the patient is taken for 
	psychiatric treatment. As one head of the units at National Institute of 
	Mental Health and Neuro Sciences put it: &quot;We have to first treat the burn 
	injuries and then treat the mental illness! Quite a few godmen have 'come 
	up' in life by starting their career with this simple trick. One of the well 
	known examples is a Satya Narayana who was a daily wager in the post office, 
	who one fine morning woke up and called himself as Ganapathi Satchidananda 
	Swamy! He has now built a huge ashram at Mysore and specialises in numerous 
	types of quackery! Not to be left behind, some of the Bhootha Darshana 
	pathries of our district perform the same! In 1977, when Dr.A.T.Kovoor, the 
	eminent rationalist of Sri Lanka, had thrown challenges to godmen, one 
	godman from Kerala had challenged him to perform arathi with lit camphor on 
	his palm! We, the rationalists, trained hundreds of our grass root level 
	workers to do that and challenged the changeller to do arathi, placing the 
	camphor on his long flowing beard !Because our contention was that anyone 
	could keep a lit camphor on the palm but, if someone could keep it on his 
	beard, we would consider that one a miracle! In DK, we have a ritual called 
	'Deetige Deepina' The oracle, possessed by the spirit, takes a burning torch 
	and touches his body with it. No harm is done because they say the spirit 
	which possesses the oracle protects him from the fire. The fact is that 
	there is no need for any spirit to protect the oracle. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is done is that the torch 
	touching the skin is moved slowly. It is well known that moving fire does 
	not burn! Besides, the torch burns wild vegetable oils which are not 
	volatile, their calorific value is lower than mineral oils. So, what appears 
	to be a miracle is not! One of my close friends, who is a doctor and an 
	unbeliever, used to be abused by the family spirit during its annual ritual. 
	So, to take revenge, my friend bribed the oracle's brother with the help of 
	a bottle of liquor and asked him to embrace the oracle tightly when he does 
	the ritual of &quot;Jeetige deepine'. The brother, fortified with spirits of the 
	organic variety, tightly embraced his sibling possessed by the spirits of 
	the nether world! Finally, the oracle ended up in the hospital with second 
	degree burns! After making enquiries, he came to know the reason for his 
	injuries and after that stopped abusing my friend! The very same principle 
	of moving fire not burning is made use of in fire walking. Here, the spirit 
	possessed walk over glowing embers. Their feet do not get burnt or they 
	claim that the spirit which possesses them offers them protection from fire! 
	This is due to what is called the Liedenfrost effect, named after the 
	scientist who first described it. When wet skin comes into contact with a 
	heated surface, the water vapour formed acts as an insulating layer for a 
	few seconds. Within these, one would have passed over the fire. So, fire 
	walking is no miracle. Anyone can do it. Fire walking is passed off as a 
	miracle in quite a few situations, societies and cultures. In Dakshina 
	Kannada, the oracles, possessed by spirits, walk and dance on glowing 
	embers. They make their devotees walk on them also! As a part of Moharram 
	celebrations, fire walking is performed. In many tribes coming of age 
	ceremonies involve a fire walk. In the west, many weekend self improvement 
	courses end with a fire walk. In Ramayana, Seetha had to do a fire walk to 
	demonstrate her purity! So, we can see that this so called miracle is not 
	confined to any culture, country, religion or civilisation. Many have 
	discovered this phenomenon independently and made use of it! In fact, its 
	exposure has been quite useful. In a remote village of Bijapur district, a 
	sadhu appeared one fine day and started performing miracles. On an 
	auspicious day, selected by him, he claimed that he would do a fire walk and 
	demonstrate his divine power. On the appointed day, a fire was made and the 
	embers spread out for him to perform a fire walk. However, at that time, one 
	of the people, at the spot, who had read my book on exposure of miracles, 
	knew that fire walking was not a miracle. So, before the sadhu could walk on 
	the embers, our man walked across! He told the assembled crowd, that fire 
	walking was not a miracle and the sadhu was a fraud! The miracle man was 
	duly thrashed, tied to a tree and unceremoniously thrown out of the village! 
	Fire walking is also practised by the devotees of Ayyappa Swamy! They 
	perform a fire walk to show their devotion. For the devotee, fire walk is 
	virtually a cake walk because they walk bare foot for nearly a month during 
	their period of fulfilling the requirements for a visit to Shabarimalai. So, 
	one can be sure that all the so called miracles with fire are no miracles at 
	all! In fact, we have challenged those who claim that they can walk on fire 
	by divine power to stand on glowing embers for 30 seconds. If their feet do 
	not bum, we would believe that they really have supernatural powers! Sadly, 
	to this date, none who claim supernatural immunity to fire have come forward 
	to accept this challenge!</font></p>
