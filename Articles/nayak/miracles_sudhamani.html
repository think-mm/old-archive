	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">FOR THE 
	UNFAMILIAR, Sudhamani is the name of the multi crore-empire proprietrix who 
	goes by the name Mata Amritanandamayi. Her story is a typical rugs to richer 
	one and a fairy tale of one who made good despite all the odds. It is also 
	an insight into how through a combination of rustic charm, “spirituality” 
	and a shrewd business sense can make one rich in this country beyond ones 
	imagination. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Today, her business draws donations from all over the world and to some of 
	the largest single foreign exchange earners of Kerala are her trusts. In her 
	name we have various professional colleges, schools, technical institutions 
	whose earnings must be astronomical. Though ostensibly these are charitable 
	education like all the other good things of life does not come free. Her 
	medical colleges charge a good 2.75 lakhs per student as annual fees; other 
	institutions too collect fees depending on the market forces of demand and 
	supply. The schools running in her name are also collecting hefty donations. 
	One should say definitely not bad for a villager who knows only one language 
	and is barely literate. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Born in a fisherman’s family about half a century back, Sudhamani is the 
	third child of Sugunanandan and Damayanthi. All together thirteen children 
	were born to this couple of whom four died at birth and one before 2 months 
	of age. Going by the hagiographical account of her life entitled Mata 
	Amritanandamayi- her birth itself was a miraculous event. The mother did not 
	feel any pain or discomfort and the newborn had a beaming smile on her face. 
	The baby had a dark blue complexion, lay in padmasan and her fingure were 
	held in chinmudra (all acclaiming her saintly deportation). Her genius 
	became manifest at a very tender age. She started speaking at the age of 6 
	months and by the age of two, purportedly without any instructions from any 
	human agency started singing prayers and short songs in praise of Sri 
	Krishna.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Her childhood was spent with siblings and at school. Again at school she was 
	ahead of her class getting the Ist rank and scoring full marks in all the 
	subjects despite that she was often absent from school because of her 
	household responsibilities. At a young age she used to go into trances and 
	manifest “possession”. She used to spend long hours in meditation. Naturally 
	she had to leave school and home too. After sometime she started staying 
	astride the house and a small hut was built which finally became her ashram.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Not that she had no enemies. Her enemies tried to kill her by various means 
	starting from black magic to attempting to stab her directly. Every time her 
	divine power got over the evil and nothing happened to her. The main 
	villains here were the rationalists. <br>
	In every possible way, the rationalists movement tried to get at her. She 
	was given deadly poison laced milk, which she consumed knowingly and then 
	vomited out. One rationalist tried to stab her, she gestured and he 
	collapsed. He was hospirtalised and could not be saved despite the best of 
	medical care! The opposition by the villainous rationalist movement 
	continues even now. Anyway more about it later. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Coming to the miracules of Sudhamani, there are three very notable ones. The 
	first is lighting lamps without oil. It was not the rationalist movement 
	that was her enemy then. Her chief detractor was at home. It was her 
	brother. He tried his best to spoil her worship. One day he broke the oil 
	lamp that used to be lit in the temple when she used go into Krishna Bhava ( 
	for the ignorant, Krishna Bhava is when she used to act like Sri Krishna 
	after going into a state of trance. The devotees who came for darshan were 
	very disappointed as seeing the lamp broken. So they were told to bring sea 
	shells, place wicks in them and light them. Lo, the miracle happened. The 
	wicks lit and burnt throughout the night. Such was the power of the great 
	miraculous woman. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	The second miracle was that of Dattan, a leper. At a very young age he 
	contracted the disease and was an outcast. People spat on him because of his 
	ugly looks and foul smelling wounds. He went to visit the ‘mother’ during 
	her Bhave Darshan day, she invited him in licked his wounds, sucked out the 
	pus, blood and applied sacred ash all over his body. Dattan was transformed. 
	All his wounds healed, his eyes opened, there is no more blood and pus 
	oozing. And a new medicine for leprosy had been discovered. Apply the 
	spittle of the “divine mother” and it shall heal. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Yet another miracle of note has to do with the multiplication of food. As 
	usual, her ashram was overcrowded with devotees. There wasn’t enough 
	prasadam. The “divine mother” applied her miraculous power and the food 
	multiplied. It was more than enough to go around. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	With miracles like this, there should not be dearth of gullible devotees. In 
	September 2003 when her birthday was celebrated, the Deputy Prime Minister, 
	the President of India all rushed to greet her. Besides, thousands of 
	devotees have come to the celebrations from all over the world. The rational 
	(!), hardheaded Chief Minister of Kerala is her devotee. In Karnataka, she 
	is going to be a state guest. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Well it is the good fortune of the people of Mangalore that this great 
	divine personality is coming over here. A local committees has been set up 
	with very prominent people at the helm of affairs, many of them being 
	doctors.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Shall we have the opportunity of witnessing the miracles of this lady when 
	she visits Mangalore? Shall we have one or more of the following? </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		1. Light lamps around Mangala Stadium with seashells with wicks in them, 
		which will burn with her power?<br>
		2. Will she be kind enough to go to the leprosy wards of two important 
		hospitals in Mangalore to heal the patients? <br>
		3. Will she be kind enough to perform a miracle of multiplying food so 
		that we shall not have anymore-hungry people in our city? </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	From what I foresee, nothing of the sort shall happen. One more villain will 
	be added to the group of rationalists who tried to displease her. </font></p>
