	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">CULTS ARE VERY DANGEROUS, as many 
	past examples have shown! Because, the members form a very closed group, 
	stick to each other and interpret the whole world through their own, 
	sometimes very much jaundiced eyes! We have the tragedies like mass 
	suicides, murders, bombings etc by perpetrated followers of such cults. 
	Sometimes the power struggles within have ended up in the annihilation of 
	one or more groups.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	One such becoming quite popular these days in the cult of ‘‘ Kalki Bhagwan’’. 
	The bearded man and his consort shown in the photograph are the patron 
	figures of this cult. One of their very important duties of every member is 
	the performance of pujas on every auspicious occasion. The devotees are 
	encouraged to perform various yagas to celebrate their birthdays, wedding 
	anniversaries etc. naturally these cost money and good amount of the income 
	of devotees will go into the coffers of the ‘‘Bhagwan’’. They have a 
	nationwide network and are well organised. This organisation has been dogged 
	by controversy. The ‘‘Bhagwan’’ who claims to be the last avatara of Vishnu 
	is supposed to have many miraculous powers. Before his incarnation as the 
	God, he was working as a clerk in Railways. Once one gets into the avatara 
	of a God, there is no need to work! Devotees who slog will take care of all 
	the needs, whims and fancies. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	In Karnataka, this cult has a good following in many districts. A couple of 
	years back, on a trip to Kodagu; I had been attacked by some of his devotees 
	for having challenged the miracles. A couple of months ago, when I had been 
	to Virajpet, one man asked me whether I could recognise him. When I said I 
	had a vague collection of having seen him before, he informed me that he was 
	one of the people who had attacked me a couple of years back. Now, he 
	thanked me very much for having brought him out of the clutches of the Kalki 
	gang. He also explained that it was my lecture-demonstration that started 
	him thinking about the truth behind Kalki’s supernatural’s powers and after 
	reasoning out, he had rejected the superstitions about him.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	That reminded me of another incident of Mercara. Dr. Ganapathi, the convenor 
	of the Kodagu district Vigyana Parishath had send me a cutting from a 
	newspaper which started that honey was miraculously dripping from a 
	photograph of Kalki! When I sent a statement to the same newspaper 
	challenging the person who claimed that the miracle was happening in his 
	house, to hand over the photographs to me and if it continued for a week. I 
	would give him a lakh of rupees! The effect of this was that the miracle was 
	not heard afterwards.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	But, Kalki’s miracles do not stop that easily. The most recent are the 
	happenings in a house at Chitpady, Udupi. To the observer, it becomes very 
	clear that this is a business of one upmanship. Because in this house from a 
	number of photos of the living God, turmeric powder and kumkum are supposed 
	to be flowing. After appearing on a large laminated photograph, these 
	substances are forming a heap at the feet of the divine couple. The only 
	catch here is that the last part of the flow, i.e. from the picture to the 
	heap is not visible to the naked eye. But, we are told that this is 
	evidenced by the growing heap. When the growth was pointed out to be not 
	apparent, the reply was that it was very, very slow and could be made out by 
	the increasing sizes of the heaps, which were growing day by day or rather 
	in the night!</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Since this ‘miracle’ had been reported by a local eveninger on its front 
	page, we decided to investigate it. When our team of four visited the place, 
	there was a stream of visitors to and from the house. The house itself was a 
	very small one with only two rooms. Occupying a very prominent place in the 
	largest room was a photo of the Kalki couple, which was laminated and again 
	covered with plastic. On the plastic cover there were smears of a yellowish 
	liquid which was claimed to be ghee, stuck to this a few grains of rice 
	could be seen. We were told that none except an appointed person who was the 
	head of the local unit could touch that. The heaps of turmeric and kumkum 
	were not allowed to be disturbed. We were told that those would be 
	distributed after the heaps stopped growing. When queried as when that would 
	be, the spokesperson said she had no idea. Most interesting character was 
	this girl. A second year PU student, she and her widowed mother were the 
	only occupants of the house. After Kalki’s local chapter heard of the news, 
	one of their lady representatives who was sent there was also present. All 
	the explanation were given by the daughter. The mother was inside a room and 
	incommunicado to outsiders. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	Below the photographs we noticed two small tumblers containing milk. We were 
	told that milk used to be drunk by Kalki. But the glasses appeared to be 
	full that evening. The explanation was that the drinking does not happen 
	everyday. It appeared that Kalki required very little nourishment and 
	sometimes nothing at all. The milk was turning sour because even Kalki’s 
	great power could not check the spoilage. We were assured that at the end of 
	the day, the milk would be replaced by a fresh quantity.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	There were no independent witnesses to corroborate the version offered about 
	the so-called miracles. All the happenings were when no outsider used to be 
	present. The whole incident appeared to be a story concocted by the 
	mother-daughter duo to attract attention to themselves. At a later stage it 
	looks as if their co-conspirators of the Kalki gang joined in.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	What was surprising to us was the gullibility of the general public and the 
	press. The versions of the mother-daughter duo were swallowed hook, line and 
	sinker by the sensation mongering evening newspapers. None questioned them 
	as to how these things were materialising only when no one was present. No 
	one raised doubts about the ghee pouring out of the photo, which appeared as 
	liquid smeared on to the plastic covering.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	For the four of us it was once again a damp squib in our search for a 
	genuine miracle. The members of the investigating team were Dr Bhaskar Mayya 
	and Balakrishna Parkala, the president and secretaries respectively of the 
	Udupi District Vicharavadi Vedike, Varun Pai and yours truly from the DK 
	Rationalists Association.</font></p>
