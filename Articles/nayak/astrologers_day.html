	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">From 
	a long time, we have been waging a battle against one of the foremost 
	superstitions - astrology. As a fad, one can say it could be an amusing 
	pastime. But, when taken seriously, particularly the advise of the 
	astrologers who practice it for a consideration, it could be dangerous. The 
	very recent ‘expose’ conducted on the 26th March, 2004 was one that proved 
	how astrologers make fools of their prey. This came as a blessing in 
	disguise to prove a point connected to an incident at Haveri, in November 
	2003.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been to Haveri to 
	lecture at a state level science congress and was lodged at the best hotel 
	in the place! Coming down one day after lunch, I saw two women - obviously 
	widows - standing in front of the closed door of the hotel’s resident 
	astrologer, with anxiety on their faces. So, to satisfy my morbid curiosity, 
	I enquired as to whom were they looking for. They said the astrologer and 
	their tale of woe followed! A year back, death of the husband of one of the 
	women was suspected to be the result of black magic. To confirm the same, 
	they had visited the astrologer who immediately agreed that it was so and 
	suggested ways of countering it. Of course, all of those involved rituals, 
	which he himself would perform. These like all good things of life were not 
	free. After a year of spending about Rs. 30,000 there was no relief. So, 
	they had come for another round of consultations. When I asked them why they 
	still wanted to spend money, the reply was that they were unable to get out 
	of the clutches of this charlatan to whom they had confided many of their 
	family secrets.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was determined that such 
	people should be exposed and their modus operandi laid bare to the public. 
	The visit of a team from BBC gave us that chance. The BBC was making a 
	documentary about the top miracle man of India, Satya Narayana Raju -a.k.a. 
	Satya Sai Baba. As a part of that they wanted to film an expose program of a 
	local charlatan. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To set a trap, I walked 
	into the room of one such called Raju, who has set up shop at a hotel on KSR 
	Road. On being told that my niece in England was having problems and asked 
	whether he could solve them, he told me that his power could reach any where 
	in the world! To diagnose the nature of the problem and to cast the 
	horoscope of my mythical niece in England, he asked me to pick up some 
	shells and drop them on his table. Based on some calculations, which he 
	arrived at after observing them, the document was duly prepared. For this, I 
	had to shell out a hundred-rupee note. Then, he asked me whether I wanted to 
	know what the problem was due to. When I replied in the affirmative, another 
	two hundred rupees was demanded. Again, I was asked to pick up and throw the 
	shells. After this, he came to the conclusion that two people were casting 
	spells on us. I asked him to wait for a few weeks before my niece would come 
	down from England. But, Raju was quick to remark that the black magic was 
	not directed against her alone. He told me that the whole family was the 
	target and if immediate steps were not taken, we would all be harmed.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made me hold a coconut 
	in my hand and pray to a “Amma” to ward off all evil. Then, I was asked to 
	rotate it clockwise over my head nine times, each time saying “Amma, please 
	help me to get over my troubles and I will perform a Rs 8,800 pooja for 
	you”. Once this ritual was over, Raju asked me to pay Rs 8,800 on the spot! 
	When I told him that I did not have much money, I was assured that he was 
	not a heartless person, but I could pay in instalments! He took my mobile 
	number and by the same evening I had calls from him demanding the first 
	instalment. The same evening, I paid him Rs 500 as the advance. He asked me 
	to pay at least Rs. 2000 more by the next day. Since, I wanted to play for 
	time, I did not go. But, the astrologer was quite persistent in his efforts. 
	Call after call was made to my mobile, but I did not respond.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was my mistake - when 
	I tried to get him ready for the last part of the expose, a few days before 
	the team was supposed to come from BBC, the man smelt a rat and disappeared. 
	So, it became imperative to look for another astrologer.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next “astrologer” we 
	met was the above-mentioned Pandith Hanumantha Rao Joshi, who had a room in 
	a hotel outside DC’s office. Sitting in this dingy, 100 square feet room, he 
	promised all sorts of solutions to an equal number of problems! His promises 
	can be judged from the leaflets produced along with! In this sting operation 
	the youth from DYFI too played a very active role.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 25th March at around 
	4pm I was accompanied by Yogish from Kalladka, who is an active DYFI member. 
	I assumed the identity of Narendra Bhandary, staying at VT Road. After due 
	consultations and after money changed hands, the great Pandith M. Hanumantha 
	Rao Joshi fell for my line, that I was being duped by my brother for my 
	share of ancestral property! Though this was not said in so many words, the 
	‘predictions’ were made by the great Pandith. He made me write down all 
	details on a slate, not showing it to him! Then after I put it face down, 
	all the information come out! Of course, knowing very well the modus 
	operandi of such crooks, I had put down whatever information I wanted him to 
	blurt out! He was cleverly watching the movements of my hand when I wrote 
	the answers for all the questions he asked in numerals! I was also 
	enlightened about 2 children of mine, the elder one who was ten and the 
	younger one eight, both boys!</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all this was over, 
	the great Pandith informed me that he could get my share of the property by 
	doing poojas for which he demanded a sum of Rs 5,500. The money was not for 
	him, but only to meet the expenses of a very costly pooja to be performed on 
	my behalf! I was also told to come back on the next day at 5 p.m.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the duly appointed date 
	at 5pm, three of us including Tanya Datta of BBC, who was wired for sound, 
	went into the den of the Pandith. When he saw me, he said, after I had gone 
	the previous day, he had done a special pooja by which he came to know more 
	things. He informed me confidentially that my brother along with my eldest 
	brother’s widow had performed black magic which would be specially directed 
	at my youngest son. If steps were not taken to counter it, I was warned that 
	the effects could be catastrophic! He also asked me if I had brought the 
	money! At this juncture activists of DYFI, members of the press, 
	rationalists and the cameraman of the BBC followed by photographers rushed 
	in!</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pandith was 
	flabbergasted! He was not in a position to face the array of questions from 
	the press! He was unable to answer why he could not read his own future and 
	that he would be exposed like that! They asked him how he could not find out 
	that I had been taking him for a ride and planning a sting operation! Unable 
	to answer, he was blabbering. Finally he agreed that he was taking people 
	for a ride in the name of astrology! </span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The modus operandi of such 
	people is very simple.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They read the body 
	language of their victims</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By making them 
	write details on a slate not shown to him, reading the hand movements they 
	“predict” all personal details!</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After winning the 
	victim’s confidence they start performing rituals to get off the supposedly 
	done black magic.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they learn the 
	intimate details of the victim’s family, they start blackmailing threatening 
	to reveal sensitive information to the opposite parties.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way the poor 
	victim is milked dry and just cannot get out of the clutches.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoPlainText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">This is just the proverbial 
	tip of the iceberg. Rackets like this are being run at every level and 
	gullible people being duped everywhere! Yes, he returned Rs 200 out of Rs 
	300, which had changed hands before he had made the predictions!</span></p>
