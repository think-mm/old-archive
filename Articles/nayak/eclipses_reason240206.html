	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Every time a perfectly natural 
	occurrence like a solar or lunar eclipse happens people’s reasoning power is 
	the first casualty! Pujas are announced at all temples (for a change not in 
	churches and mosques), purificatory rituals are gone through and the 
	faithful observe fasts. The streets are deserted, pregnant women stay 
	indoors and in short life comes to a standstill. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This brings us to the primary school 
	science question –What causes an eclipse? Though it is a shame that people 
	who read this should be given an answer, let me do it. A solar eclipse 
	happens when the moon intervenes between the sun and the earth and a lunar 
	eclipse when the earth comes between the sun and the moon. These do follow 
	certain rules, so it is not very difficult for even amateur astronomers to 
	predict eclipses. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Solar eclipses can be total, partial 
	or annular ones, depending on the distances at the time of the occurrence. 
	In case the eclipse is a total one there can be few minutes of darkness 
	followed by the diamond ring effect. The annular variation will form what is 
	called the ring of fire. In a country like India, where superstitions 
	abound, a whole group of the priestly class waits with open pockets for the 
	bounty of the eclipse! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The eclipse on the 3rd October, we 
	were told falls on a particularly inauspicious day, the Mahalaya Amavasya. 
	This is the new moon day on which the spirits of the long dead ancestors 
	roam the earth! That combined with an eclipse would prove to be a 
	catastrophe for the gullible and a bumper crop to the priests! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While every solar eclipse have to be 
	on a new moon day only, this particular new moon is a particularly scary 
	one. That too in the very same month we have a lunar eclipse too ! </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In some temples announcements were 
	put up a month in advance as to what time the meals are to be had. According 
	to some the last meal was to be had before 10 am and the next only on the 
	next day! This entails a fast which even the Ramzan fasters would cringe 
	from! The explanations for this was that rays emanating from the sun during 
	the eclipse would pollute all water and cooked food. This had to be 
	discarded. Some claim that even the clothing would be polluted and had to be 
	put away. AS soon as the eclipse was over, one was advised a change of 
	clothing and a bath. The more enthusiastic would even throw away all stored 
	water in the house and fill their pots afresh. That they would be filling 
	them with water already exposed to these “rays” was another matter ! </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We celebrated the solar eclipse by 
	watching this phenomenon on the grounds of Cordel Hall, Kulshekhar. From the 
	hill one could get an uninterrupted view of the sun. Dr KV Rao and Dr 
	Jayanth with the members of the Mangalore Amateur Astronomers Club had 
	assembled there with their gadgets. They had two telescopes, screens, 
	welding glasses and x-ray films to watch the event. A good number of people 
	mostly students were assembled there and participated enthusiastically. 
	Sweets were distributed to celebrate the event and after sunset the crowd 
	dispersed with the happy feeling of having witnessed a natural phenomenon 
	and enjoyed it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why do people fear eclipses? This 
	comes from a primitive fear of the sun going out! At a time when these 
	things were not understood, the primitive man feared that demons were 
	swallowing the sun. All the rituals were aimed at making the demon spit it 
	out. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While it was ritual fasting, pujas 
	and yagnas in India, in the far east drums would be beaten and crackers 
	fired to scare the demon and make him release the sun. Rahu and Ketu of the 
	Indian astrology do personify these. The rituals do work! So, their efficacy 
	is unquestionable. The sun and the moon do get released within a few hours. 
	Probably, this accounts from the fact that they are followed religiously 
	from ages! That reminds me of an anecdote quoted by Bertrand Russell. In 
	London, at the height of winter, a man was shouting at the top of his voice 
	at midnight in the Hyde Park. When questioned by a policeman, he replied 
	that he was doing that to scare away wild elephants. When the policeman told 
	him that the nearest wild elephant was thousands of miles away in Africa, 
	his reply was –see how well it works! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, each and every time, the priests 
	who have performed these rituals (of course have lined their pockets too) 
	would claim that they have saved mankind from a fate worse than death! But, 
	nowadays it is pseudoscience which reigns supreme! We are told that during 
	the time of the eclipse, poisonous rays are emitted which pollute the 
	atmosphere and cause the organisms to multiply. Another explanation is that 
	the loss of sunlight causes it. When questioned as to what emits these 
	harmful rays, there is no answer. If the period of absence of sunlight is 
	the cause for organisms to multiply, that should be happening every night 
	when there is an absence of sunlight for nearly 12 hours ! When I posed this 
	question to educated people who quote these, they have no answer and finally 
	point out to the wisdom of the ancients! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Any way we can say a lot about the 
	wisdom of our ancients, particularly Manu who laid down the Smritis which 
	goes by his name. He ‘wisely’ said that woman deserves no independence, she 
	should be subservient to her father till marriage and then to her husband, 
	after his death (of course when she has no business to live after that 
	because every pativrata should burn herself on her husband’s funeral pyre) 
	be at the mercy of her sons! Numerous such gems can be quoted which are 
	bright indicators of the wisdom of our ancients as certified in the Manu 
	Smriti. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, that prompts my question again – 
	Is it an eclipse of the celestial bodies or man’s reason?</font></p>
