	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">&nbsp;<font face="Verdana"> One Sri 
	Varadaraja Pai from a village near Belthangady&nbsp;&nbsp; in Dakshina Kannada had 
	been claiming that he has powers of healing through which he could diagnose 
	and heal diseases through what he called was a pendulum. While the pendulum 
	would diagnose disease, the treatment would be done by his recently 
	discovered technique called Cosmic therapy and teletherapy. He had also made 
	many predictions like India would become a very strong country in 25 years; 
	a dynamic young man would become the prime minister of India. Besides these 
	he had claimed that many VIPs like the prime minister of India Sri Atal 
	Behari Vajapayee was under his treatment. Yet another claim was that Prince 
	William, the grandson of queen Elizabeth of England was getting photo 
	therapy from him as requested by the office of the queen herself!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the last 
	claim that attracted our attention. Ms.Tanya Datta, a correspondent of the 
	BBC was coming to Mangalore to interview us for a feature on the rationalist 
	movement in India and when she was told that we would introduce her to a 
	person treating her Prince William, she was very thrilled and said that she 
	would be glad to meet him and carry the news back to England!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 
	afternoon of the 12<sup>th</sup> five of us set out for the village Nada 
	grama that is about 50 kms from Mangalore. On reaching the place we could 
	see quite a few people waiting outside his gate. We were told that the man 
	was waiting from some one from BBC who would come to interview him! So after 
	a short time we entered his consultation room. The room had a table and some 
	chairs and a bench for the waiting patients. One being introduced, we 
	treated to a lecture about the composition of white light, which Mr. Pai 
	claimed that it was made of 9 colors. He also claimed that these colors came 
	from different planets each representing its own color! This was followed by 
	a long lecture on his technique. He had a pendulum, which would be held over 
	a book having different pages. Depending on the information required, a 
	separate page was to be turned. The photograph or some possession of the 
	patient which could be even a lock of hair or a thumbprint would be placed 
	in front of the book with the appropriate page open, the material would be 
	placed in front and the pendulum allowed to swing. It would swing by itself 
	and provide the required answers! Once the disease was diagnosed, the same 
	device also would suggest the treatment! It would show which a color a 
	person was’ Hungry” for (in the words of the great healer himself!). Either 
	wearing an appropriate gemstone of the required color or treatment by the 
	healer himself could fulfill that hunger for a color. He could send the 
	healing powers of the required color if he were provided with a photograph 
	of the patient! In a room in his house there was an array of boxes with 
	photos stuck to the doors and with colored bulbs inside. When switched on 
	the rays would fall on the photograph and heal the patient. This was 
	explained as the basis of his “scientific” technique called tele therapy.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After these 
	explanations we came down to the practical aspects. We had a young lady with 
	us. She was put in the patient’s chair and the healer was asked to diagnose 
	her ailments. He wanted some material from her. Since there was not 
	photograph of hers available, a hair was plucked from her head and given to 
	him. He [placed the hair on the table, swung his pendulum and within seconds 
	came to the conclusion that she was perfectly healthy! However, she had some 
	personality problems for which the deficiency of green color was the cause! 
	When we told him that the perfectly normal, pretty lady was a cancer patient 
	he was taken aback! However, he told us the problem was that he had 
	diagnosed based on a hair which he said was not very good, If he were given 
	photographs, he claimed, he could tell everything about the patient. So, a 
	group photograph was produced. The healer immediately claimed that it was 
	difficult to diagnose a group photograph, but he could cut out the 
	individuals and do so. WE asked him to go ahead and he cut out the 
	individuals and swung his pendulum. One he claimed was not in the pink of 
	health. He also suggested color therapy for him. The second individuals 
	photograph was also taken to the table, the pendulum placed over it and I 
	was aced what the problem was! First a vague diagnosis was made about the 
	state of health being very, very bad. When I prodded and asked to ,be told 
	whether the person was dead or alive, the pendulum came to the conclusion 
	that he was dead. When queried whether the pendulum could enlighten us as to 
	when he had actually passed away, the reply was that it was eleven years 
	ago! The healer was then informed that the first person that he claimed was 
	not in good health was actually dead and the person whom he had claimed to 
	have died eleven years ago was in fact still alive, the quack was furious 
	.He reproached me for having approached him with unclean hands! Obviously 
	the pendulum had a fetish for cleanliness! So, when I showed him my hands 
	and told him that he could see for himself that they were very clean, he was 
	indignant at my ignorance of the English idiom and berated me for having 
	taken his word literally when he actually meant that my hands were 
	figuratively not clean! So, I showed him my hands once again to be empty, 
	waved one in the air and produced holy ash for him! He was spluttering with 
	shock and rage. Then I could not resist waving my other clean hand in the 
	aid and producing for him another heap of ash!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we 
	queried him as what was the proof that the queen of England has written to 
	him he informed us that the letter was missing as he got a huge volume of 
	correspondence which he had put away. However, the letter was traced and it 
	was just an acknowledgement from the Bucking ham palace that his letter 
	dated the 23 rd of April, 2003 had been received. There was alas no mention 
	of any treatment being requested! So, a disappointed Tanya Datta, 
	correspondent of BBC had to return with us! Thus ended the fiasco of a 
	“healer” curing people of diseases by his special powers! The team, which 
	had gone to investigate, consisted of B.Premanand, the eminent rationalist 
	and editor of the Indian Skeptic, Ms. Tanya Datta, reporter of the BBC, Ms. 
	Sheela Samuel and the undersigned!</font></p>
