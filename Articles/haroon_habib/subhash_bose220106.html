	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><i>A Tribute to Netaji Subhas Chandra 
	Bose on his birth day who&nbsp;&nbsp; emphasized that political freedom alone would 
	not be sufficient, as the ills of the British colonialism&nbsp; would continue to 
	haunt post-Independent Sub-continent .. <br>
	</i>&nbsp;<br>
	<font face="Verdana">Born in January 23, 1897, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose 
	was a unique political figure&nbsp;&nbsp; of the&nbsp; undivided India who contributed 
	immensely to the cause of Sub-continent’s&nbsp; freedom from the British 
	colonialism&nbsp; .&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Popularly known as Netaji, Subhas completed his initial education&nbsp; in&nbsp; 
	Cuttack,where&nbsp; he was born, and&nbsp; completed his graduation from the Calcutta&nbsp; 
	Presidency College in 1913.&nbsp; He&nbsp;&nbsp; left India for England to appear at the 
	Indian Civil Service Examination. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	But Subhas was the last person to&nbsp; work under the&nbsp; colonial&nbsp; Government. He&nbsp; 
	resigned ICS post and returned to India on the call of Desbandhu 
	Chittaranjan Das&nbsp; . Netaji&nbsp; was a revolutionary&nbsp; leader with a strong sense 
	of humanity&nbsp;&nbsp; . He did not have much faith in Gandhijis ‘non-violent’ 
	campaign to free India from&nbsp; an&nbsp; oppressive and colonial power&nbsp; . He had the 
	strong understanding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the colonial British power must be challenged&nbsp; 
	by a strong patriotic Indian liberation army to hasten&nbsp; independence&nbsp; . Thus 
	he&nbsp; organised, with an unprecedented courage and ability, the&nbsp; military arm 
	to&nbsp; the India’s freedom movement&nbsp; . <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	The colonial British&nbsp; perceived Netaji&nbsp; as a potential source of danger and 
	had him arrested many a times since 1924. He&nbsp; was&nbsp; released from Mandalay 
	jail in 1927,and upon&nbsp; return to Calcutta,&nbsp; Netaji was elected President of 
	the Bengal Congress Committee on October 27, 1927. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Subhas was one of the few politicians&nbsp;&nbsp; who&nbsp; worked towards Hindu-Muslim 
	unity . An immensely&nbsp; popular leader across undivided India, he&nbsp;&nbsp; was sown 
	in as Mayor of Calcutta Corporation on&nbsp; his release from jail . <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	In 1931 the split between Gandhiji and Subhas surfaced .&nbsp; Subhas viewed 
	freedom as an absolute necessity, unlike the freedom which Gandhiji was 
	&quot;negotiating&quot; with the colonial British. Netaji&nbsp;&nbsp; was arrested again, and 
	imprisoned in several jails outside West Bengal . His health deteriorated, 
	and the British authorities decided to&nbsp; send him&nbsp; to Switzerland for 
	treatment. <br>
	&nbsp; <br>
	Realizing that his avenues abroad were greater under the present situation 
	at home, Netaji&nbsp; set sail for Europe on February 23, 1933. He&nbsp; stayed in 
	various parts of Europe till&nbsp; March 1936 making contacts with Indian 
	revolutionaries and European socialists supporting the struggle for 
	Independence. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Many historians saw contradictory stances of the India’s&nbsp; most formidable 
	enemy of the colonial British&nbsp; . But what Subhas did was for India’s freedom 
	from the colonial British . While in Europe, he&nbsp;&nbsp; met Mussolini in Italy and 
	made Vienna his headquarters.&nbsp; He&nbsp;&nbsp; opposed to the racial theory of Nazism 
	but appreciated its organizational strength and discipline. On March 27, 
	1936 he sailed for Bombay&nbsp; but was taken&nbsp; to jail immediately after 
	disembarking. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Meanwhile time&nbsp; had healed the tensions between Subhas and Gandhiji, and 
	Gandhiji supported Subhas in his efforts to become the President of the next 
	Congress session, 1938. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	He went to England again&nbsp; in 1938 and rallied for the Indian freedom cause 
	amongst Indian students and British labor leaders sympathetic toward India's 
	cause. Upon his return&nbsp; in February 1938, Subhas was elected President of 
	the Indian National Congress. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Netaji&nbsp; emphasized that political freedom alone would not be sufficient, as 
	the ills of the British reign would continue to haunt post-Independent 
	India. But Gandhiji found Subhas's ideologies ‘far too leftist’&nbsp; . <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Differences between Gandhiji and Subhas led to a crisis when Gandhiji 
	opposed Subhas' idea that the Bengal Government (a coalition between the 
	Krishak Praja Party &amp; Muslim League) be ousted and the Congress take charge 
	in coalition with the Krishak party. The idea was criticized by Gandhiji and 
	Nehru, which resulted in the strengthening of the Muslim League in Bengal 
	and ultimately partition of India. It is obvious today that had Subhas been 
	able to carry out his plans, Bengal would be a different entity . But the 
	dream did not come true .&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Despite opposition from the Congress brass, Subhas was a favorite amongst 
	the majority as he was re-elected for a second term in March 1939. Gandhiji 
	considered Subhas's victory as his ‘personal defeat’ and went on a fast . 
	Netaji resigned as&nbsp; a mark of respect to Gandhiji.&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<i>Netaji In Germany&nbsp; <br>
	</i>&nbsp;<br>
	It was the time of the Second World War.&nbsp; Netaji was than interned at his 
	house in Calcutta under strict British surveillance. But the miracle man&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	left his well-guarded home, to organise Indian liberation army outside India 
	. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	He reached Germany, and&nbsp; submitted a memorandum to the German government on 
	9th April 1941 which outlined a plan for co-operation between the Axis 
	powers and India. Among other things, it called for the setting up of a 
	&quot;Free India Government&quot; in Europe, preferably in Berlin; establishment of a 
	Free India broadcasting station calling upon the Indian people to assert 
	their independence and rise up in revolt against the British colonial 
	authorities. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	After months of waiting and many moments of disappointment, Germany agreed 
	to give Netaji&nbsp; all-out help. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	The two immediate results came out following&nbsp; Subhas’a interactions with the 
	Germans .One,&nbsp;&nbsp; the establishment of a ‘Free India Center’ and inauguration 
	of a ‘Free India Radio’, both began their operations in November 1941.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	In November 1941, Azad Hind Radio&nbsp; opened its program for the first time. 
	Netaji gave the inaugural speech, which, in fact, was a disclosure of his 
	identity that had been kept officially secret for so long. He said &quot; I am 
	Subhash Chandra Bose who is still alive and talking to you&quot;. During this 
	broadcast he called Gandhiji as the father of the nation. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<i>Netaji with Japan <br>
	</i>&nbsp;<br>
	In the midst of the Second World War, on 15 February 1942, Singapore fell to 
	the Japanese army . Two days later, in an impressive ceremony held at Farrar 
	Park in the heart of the Singapore, British Indian troops were handed over 
	to the Japanese as prisoners-of-war . The&nbsp; victorious Japanese handed over 
	the commandership of the&nbsp; POWs&nbsp; to Captain Mohan Singh of the Indian 
	contingents. Mohan Singh vowed to fight the British to free India.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Netaji&nbsp; then called a conference in Tokyo . The delegates representing 
	several East and Southeast Asian countries present at the conference decided 
	to form the Indian Independence League (IIL) . Subhas&nbsp;&nbsp; was recognized as 
	head of the IIL . <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	On 15 June 1942, a conference opened in Bangkok with over a hundred 
	delegates&nbsp; attending from all over Asia. It&nbsp; decided&nbsp; to set up a political 
	nucleus to carry forward&nbsp;&nbsp; India’s independence movement from&nbsp; East Asia.&nbsp; 
	It was further decided that Singapore would be the headquarters of the IIL. 
	The Indian National Army (INA) was officially inaugurated in September 
	1942.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<i>Did Netaji really die?<br>
	</i>&nbsp;<br>
	After dropping of the atom bomb by the United States in Hiroshima on August 
	8, 1945 and Nagasaki on August 9, the Japanese surrendered. That was the 
	formal end of the&nbsp; Second World War . But Netaji,a freedom fighter, was not 
	willing to surrender . <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	From various accounts, Netaji reportedly&nbsp; flew to Bangkok on August 16, 1945 
	and to Saigon on August 17. He was accompanied by Col. Habibur Rehman, Col. 
	Pritam Singh, Major Abid Hasan, S.A. Ayer and Debnath Dass. He&nbsp;&nbsp; was told to 
	board a plane&nbsp; for Taipei and then Dairen (Manchuria). With Netaji’s 
	reserved, only one&nbsp; more seat was available in the aircraft . Finally, 
	Netaji and Col. Habibur Rehman boarded the aircraft . There were ten other 
	Japanese in the plane which took off from Tourane on August 18, 1945 between 
	5 and 5.15 a.m. and flew to Taipei (Japanese Taihoku).<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	The aircraft again took off from Taipei and just after rising to the height 
	of 30 feet, it burst into flames and crashed. This was on August 18, at 
	about 5 p.m. Netaji&nbsp; reportedly received extensive burns injuries .&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Dr Yoshimi Tameyoshi who attended on Netaji stated, &quot;When he (Netaji) was 
	laid on the bed, I personally cleaned his injuries with oil and dressed 
	them. During the first four hours, he was unconscious&quot;. Later, when he 
	gained consciousness the doctor asked him 'Whether there was any statement, 
	will or such matter he wanted to make', Netaji reportedly&nbsp; answered, 
	'Nothing'. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Dr Tameyoshi added,' After the fourth hour he appeared to be sinking into 
	unconsciousness.' At about 23.20 hours, Subhash Chandra Bose died. &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Tameyoshi's statement&nbsp; was brought to light by the noted archivist and 
	historian Dr T.R. Sareen from the achieves of Public Records Office 
	records.&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	But the major question arises is whether the statement&nbsp; is factual or not. 
	Because the&nbsp; history is always written by the winners.&nbsp; There are many big 
	questions which have been left unanswered. These include - Whether Netaji 
	was really there in the plane at the time of the crash? Was he mortally 
	injured after the crash? Did he somehow escape before or after the crash?
	<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	The first enquiry was setup almost immediately by Lord Wavell, the Viceroy, 
	to look into the disappearance of Netaji. It&nbsp; came to the conclusion that 
	Netaji had died. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	The first Indian enquiry relating to Netaji's death was commissioned by the 
	Government of India under Shah Nawaz Khan, a Railway Minister in the Union 
	Government. He quickly declared that Netaji&nbsp; had died at Formosa on the 18th 
	of August, 1945. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Then came the Khosla enquiry.&nbsp; It was commissioned by the Indian government&nbsp; 
	under Prime minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi. The Khosla commission&nbsp; visited many 
	important places like Singapore, Bangkok and Rangoon and interviewed many 
	people. But it&nbsp; faced&nbsp; loss of credibility . After four years it gave the 
	verdict that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose had died at Formosa, the place 
	where Khosla&nbsp; did not visit . <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	The BJP&nbsp; led NDA government&nbsp; instituted the latest&nbsp; inquiry by setting up 
	the Justice J.C. Mukherjee commission. The Mukherjee commission's report is&nbsp; 
	expected to submit its report soon. Let us&nbsp; hope that it will have the final 
	word in the mystery </font><i><b><font face="Verdana">.</font>­SAN-Feature
