	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Iran was conquered by the ferrous 
	Islamic Bedouins in 7th Century, its men killed in hundreds of thousands, 
	others taken as slaves, its fertile lands distributed to the new Islamic 
	Bedouin feudal lords and the loyal local tribes, its women and children sold 
	into slavery. Men and women were forced to choose between Islam and death. 
	Many decided for the lesser evil- the Islam; others were lucky to be given 
	the choice of converting to Islam or accepting the status of Zimmis, 
	non-Muslims living as second class citizens in the Islamic state while 
	paying poll-tax, called the Jaziya, to the Islamic government. The 
	uncultured Islamic Bedouins sat on the seat of a highly civilized kingdom 
	and soon the centuries old, great Iranian civilization was degraded into 
	virtual barbarism. Scholarly works were destroyed; highly learned 
	Zorothashts were forced to flee. Iranian dress and cultural activities and 
	traditions were banned, their legal code disregarded and in its place the 
	Islamic Bedouin code consisting of socially and mentally backward tribal 
	brutal customs was enforced. The end of highly developed civilization and 
	culture was a painful process; for not only it was crude Arabisation, it was 
	also a social and cultural degradation. A large number of people belonging 
	to the local ethnic, racial and cultural groups refused to live under the 
	Bedouin barbarism and fled to the surrounding mountains mixing with the 
	Kurdish tribes. Iranian civilization soon responded with wars of 
	independence and rebellions; the family of the Iranian Royal House fled to 
	China and tried to enlist an army to regain their country and civilization 
	but the ferocious Islamic Bedouins proved to be too destructive, and crude 
	barbarism won over a fine civilization. Today’s Iran is basically an Islamic 
	spiritual colony under the painful presence of the offspring of ethnic 
	Islamic Bedouins who still hold the possession of the lands once 
	confiscated, looted and plundered by their forefathers. Historically, 
	however, since the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate of the 8th Century, Iran had 
	belonged to the dissident Islamic Bedouin religious sect-the Shiites. After 
	the Khomeni’s bloody Islamic revolution, the Islamic reconquest for Iranian 
	souls was restarted. While hundreds of thousands perished in the useless 
	Islamic Iran versus Islamic Iraq war, the rest of the Iranians were forced 
	to undergo a renewed “cultural revolution”- the process of enforced 
	Arabisation and Islamisation. The result was a backward looking, 
	fundamentalist and fanatic, Islamic theocratic state of Iran bent on 
	exporting its brand of Shiite Islamic cultural revolution and terrorism all 
	over the Islamic countries. Today the Islamic theocracy of Iran is the 
	godfather of the international Shiite Islamic terrorism. (Iranian Shiites 
	are an Islamic sect like the Protestant Christians distinct from the Saudi 
	Sunnis who are an Islamic sect like the Catholic Christians). This Allah's 
	government in Iran has proved to be the most evil religious state in the 
	world today. Torture, murder and Islamic absolutism have transformed it into 
	an Islamic version of Hitler's Nazi-ism, Stalin's Communism and Mussolini's 
	Fascism combined together. There were 5,195 political and religious 
	executions only in 1983 alone! Few years ago a bill was presented in Iranian 
	Parliament asking that in according with the tradition of Islamic prophet, 
	Iranian mullahs and Taliban be allowed with 9 years old child-girls! Human 
	rights are definitely not allowed to exist in the Islamic Republic Iran (a 
	state thousand times worse than the past Iranian kingdom), where, according 
	to the English language Radio Iran, the Holy Spirit of Imam Khomeni hovers 
	over the country all the times. Women suffer the worst, many women have been 
	hanged on suspicion of sexual crimes. Even proved virgins have been sent to 
	gallows, however, they are hanged only after being Islamically raped, as 
	Iranian Islam does not allow hanging of virgins. Iran had used its oil money 
	in the interest of Islamic revolutions all over the world, and continues to 
	do so. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Algeria, known for its Islamic civil 
	war continues with its Islamic horrors. Islamic absolutism and 
	totalitarianism is imposed with guns and slaughters in the interest of 
	religion of Islam. Men are usually killed for their religio-political crimes 
	while women are killed just for the crime of being a woman in an Islamic 
	country. Thousands were islamically raped and more than 500 were killed only 
	in 1993. Women have been killed for not wearing hijab (veil) or refusing to 
	do so when imposed, for refusing to engage in Iranian-style temporary 
	marriage, for being married to foreign men, and for working and living 
	alone. The victims have been as young as 9 years and as old as 69 years. 
	Women are often raped and tortured before being slaughtered. Thousands find 
	themselves imprisoned in Islamic camps for no legitimate reasons. It is 
	worth mentioning that women had a respectable status in society before the 
	conquest of Algeria by Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Egyptians, heir to the great 
	Pharonic and Alexandrian civilizations continue to suffer the chronic evil 
	of Islam. Known for the miseries of hijab and female genital mutilation, 
	Egypt is also a center of child prostitution for the wealthy Saudi Islamic 
	Bedouins. In Egypt four out of five women are forced to wear some kind of 
	hijab. Female genital mutilation is very common; up to 73% in Cairo and 95% 
	in rural areas. In 1995 a shaikh (religious dignity) of Al-Azhar University 
	Cairo issued a fatwa (the religious decree or bull), which reportedly 
	announced the procedure pf Female Genital Mutilation as &quot;laudable practice 
	that does honor to women&quot;; and stating that it was, a religious duty as 
	important as praying to Allah. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sudan had a long history of Islamic 
	conquest and repression. Islamic totalitarianism and barbarity continues to 
	this day. Recently, Sudan was brutalized by the Saudi-backed Gen. Numeri's 
	Islamic fascism. In 1992 religious decree (fatwa) was issued that gave 
	justification to the military onslaught against the non-Muslims. Islamic 
	barbarism and genocide continues in Darfur to this day. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indonesian Islamic army 
	mass-murdered 200,000 East Timurian non-Muslims before East Timor got its 
	independent. The country is known for its extreme religiosity, corruption, 
	ethno-religious problems and Islamic extremism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pakistan, an experimental laboratory 
	of Islam, had turned into a horror. Notwithstanding the hundreds of 
	thousands of religious rapes, abductions and murders under the watchful eyes 
	of the very Christian administration ofr the Holy Roman British Empire at 
	the time of religious division of the Indian sub-continent in 1947 by the 
	Empire, when half a million people were forced to migrate, Pakistan has 
	never made any certain move towards civilization and continues to be a 
	center of the Islamic fundamentalism, extremism and terrorism. Pakistan's 
	very Islamic army invaded her province of East Pakistan in 1971, killing 
	hundreds of thousands of Bengali Muslims and non-Muslims directly or through 
	their Islamic criminal gangs (Al-Shamas ans Al-Badar of Jamaat-I-Islami) and 
	raping more than two hundred thousand women ranging 9-69 years in age in its 
	attempt to create a half breed Pak-Bengal race which would be loyal to Islam 
	and Pakistan. In 1974 Pakistan army invaded its province of Baluchistan 
	resulting in similar calamities. In 1980 Islamist General Zia ul Haq 
	introduced further islamization under the Saudi pressure for introduction of 
	the medieval and tribal Islamic Shariah. Along with the compulsory public 
	prayers, there were brutal Islamic laws against the very natural sexual acts 
	and for the presumed blasphemy: the repressive Hudood Ordinance and the 
	infamous Blasphemy laws. Thousands of innocent women continue to suffer 
	under these and other Islamic fascist laws for mere allegations. Raped women 
	had been sent to gallows for the crime of being raped. (Islamic Shariah is 
	the only system of law, which punishes the victims: Fatemollah). Pakistani 
	state has proved to be a willing and sinister instrument of the evil Islamic 
	mullah fascism and terrorism. Pakistan created the hated Afghan Taliban and 
	many other such organizations in Afghanistan. Similar organizations continue 
	to flourish in Pakistan and try to create a totalitarian and fascist Islamic 
	state. Despite all tall claims of fight against the Islamic terrorism, the 
	evil continues to flourish. Pakistan is undoubtedly a major source of supply 
	for the Iraqi terrorism. Illicit drug trade continues with the blessings of 
	the Islamic mullahs and the ISI (the Islamic Military Intelligence) There 
	are Islamic prostitution centers in every Islamic city of the Islamic 
	Pakistan where abducted and non-Muslims women are forced to suffer the very 
	religious Muslims. The secular, liberal and rationalist intellectuals 
	continue to suffer in Pakistan like the victims of the infamous Christian 
	Inquisition of medieval Europe. While the Christian churches burnt the 
	heretics, Islamic mullahs get them indicted for Blasphemy and get them 
	locked in the Death-Cells. </font></p>
