	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Indian sub-continent suffered the 
	humiliation and destruction under Islam, as did Africa. The Islamic General 
	Mohammad Bin Qasim decimated great Buddhist and Hindu civilizations. Acting 
	on the orders of a representative of the Islamic Caliph, Governor Hijaj Bin 
	Yousaf (who was a deadly enemy of the Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Hussein's 
	family-some of whom have taken refuge under the Buddhist monarch Raja Dahir 
	in Sindh), Mohammad Bin Qasim conquered the kingdom in 712 CE. His Islamic 
	plunderers and looters demolished temples, shattered sculptures, plundered 
	palaces and killed thousands. It took his Islamic army three days to 
	slaughter the inhabitants of Debal, their women and children were taken into 
	slavery. Later on he pardoned many prisoners and tried to establish a just 
	rule of law which enraged the very Islamic and murderous Governor Hijaj Bin 
	Yousaf; therefore Qasim again reverted to the Islamic barbarity and 
	massacred between 6-16 thousands in Brahiminabad, their women and children 
	were sent to Arab Islamic slave markets. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This was the beginning of the 
	destruction of the classical ancient Indian civilization, and start of the 
	medieval age of Islamic darkness in India. The 11th century witnessed 
	another Islamic murderer and plunderer, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi an agent of 
	Islamic Caliph, who utterly ruined the great Indian civilization and looted 
	and plundered most of its wealth. Fifty thousand Hindus were massacred in 
	just one of his attacks at Somnath; he invaded India more than 17 times. 
	Thousands of Hindu men and women were sent to the Islamic Afghani slave 
	markets. The highly cultured and civilized daughters of the noble Hindu 
	families were sold to the illiterate, un-cultured and barbaric Afghanis for 
	equivalent of just one Frank (Pound/Dollar) each. After every Afghani Muslim 
	had four wives each, there were lots of surplus women left; to that the evil 
	Islamic mullahs responded with an ingenious translation of Koranic verses 
	proving that Allah allowed each Muslim to marry 18 women at a time along 
	with an unlimited number of women as concubines. Soon the new military 
	instruments of the Islamic Caliph, the Turks and the Moguls followed, 
	decimated captured Delhi and turned whole of India into a grand open-air 
	slave camp. Sultan Firoze Shah Tughlaq- an Islamic Turk ruler had 100,000 
	men-slaves and thousands of female sex-slaves in his harem; the pious 
	Islamic Mongol (Mogul) Emperor Shahjehan had 15,000 female sex-slaves and 
	concubines for his personal harem. Indeed, the Islamic Turk invaders and 
	rulers did the same in India as they did in Armenia-the whole races of 
	peoples were exterminated. (However, credit must be given here to the 
	agnostic and secular-minded, humanist Mogul Emperor Akbar the Great who 
	refused the title of &quot;the King of Muslims&quot; and preferred to be called &quot;the 
	shadow of God&quot;- for his God, he declared (in accordance with the mind and 
	language of his age), is the beneficial deity and protector of all-Hindus, 
	Muslims and other races of humans and creatures alike. He gave up his faith 
	in Islam and tried his genius in creating a pluralistic religion comprising 
	traditions of all the prevalent religions and ideologies of India. He even 
	invited the Christian Jesuits priests from Goa to his 
	ideology-discussion-palace but could not swallow their childish 
	Jesus-son-of-God myth). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The medieval Islamic Empire of the 
	Turkish Osmania Caliphate disappeared after Axis defeat in the World War I 
	and with the rise of the Turkish secular hero Mustafa Kemal Pasha. However, 
	it soon metamorphosed into the modern Saudi Islamic spiritual Empire. It is 
	noteworthy that while the very Christian Holy Roman British Empire of the 
	West required standing armies to control the bodies of men in all its 
	colonies, the theocratic Saudi Islamic spiritual Empire of the East depended 
	on the standing army of clerics-Mullahs and Imams-stationed in mosques to 
	control the minds of men-the social, cultural spiritual and psychological 
	control. It is true that Islam dismantled the old Arab tribal loyalties and 
	some of its taboos and traditions; however it created a new tribe in the 
	name of Islam with prophet himself as its chieftain and his family and 
	tribe-Hashmis and Quresh acquiring an elevated and sacred status- a 
	replacement of old medieval tribe with a new theocratic tribe. However, it 
	essentially continued many of the ancient pagan rituals of worship as well 
	as many of its old taboos and traditions. The tribal blood loyalties were 
	replaced with the new tribal religious loyalties. At intellectual level 
	Islam is merely the continuation of the medieval Jahiliya (Ignorance) in the 
	holy garb of Islam- the Islamic Jahilia (the Islamic Medieval Ignorance). 
	Modern Islam is, indeed, merely a continuation of that medieval tribal 
	ignorance and mental backwardness. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the advent of the Saudi oil, 
	petrodollars started to support the Islamic extremist movements all over the 
	world and continue to do so. The Saudi petrodollars have created thousands 
	of Islamic centres for social and political control and propaganda- the 
	mosques-all over the world; 1000 mosques were built in the USA only in just 
	last few years. Islamic brainwashing and political propaganda continues in 
	these mosques and madrassas-the religious schools, as well as through the 
	Islamic newspapers, magazines, radios and televisions. All kind of extremist 
	Islamic terrorism and fundamentalism emanates and flows from the &quot; Kernel of 
	Evil- the Epicentre of the ugly Islamism-the Saudis&quot;. For Allah of the 
	Saudis makes submission to Islam obligatory for all humans. Those who refuse 
	their submission to Allah or differ from the Saudi version of Islam are 
	called the Satan's party, and must be eliminated by Saudis or their paid and 
	brainwashed zombies-the Muslims- called the Allah's party. Saudi Arabia is 
	in fact the worst example of Islamic medievalism, and mental, social 
	backwardness. Slavery was legal in Saudi until 1960s when it was officially 
	abolished on the personal request of the non-Muslim US President J F 
	Kennedy! However, it continues in new names: the foreign female domestic 
	servants-the private property of the Islamic Bedouin barbarians. Saudi 
	petrodollars continue to support the extremist and fundamentalist mullahs, 
	and continue to lure the Islamic states into the barbarity of the Islamic 
	medieval Shariah laws, and the Saudis continue to spread Islamic mullah 
	terrorism and Islamic theocratic totalitarianism all over the world.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Iran basically an Islamic spiritual 
	colony, is the godfather of the Shiite Islamic terrorism,( Saudi Sunnis are 
	an Islamic sect like the Christian Catholics while Shiites are like the 
	Protestant Christians). This Allah's government in Iran is the most evil 
	religious state today. Torture, murder and Islamic absolutism- an Islamic 
	version of Hitler's Nazism, Stalin's Communism and Mussolini's Fascism 
	combined. There were 5,195 political and religious executions only in 1983 
	alone! Few years ago a bill was presented in Iranian Parliament asking that 
	in according with the tradition of Islamic prophet, marriage should be 
	allowed with 9 years old girl child! Human rights are definitely not allowed 
	to exist in the Islamic Iran, where according to the English language Radio 
	Iran, the Holy Spirit of imam Khomeni hovers over Iran all the times. Women 
	have been hanged on suspicion of sexual crimes. Even proved virgins have 
	been sent to gallows, however, they are hanged only after being raped, as 
	Iranian Islam does not allow hanging of virgins. Iran had used its oil money 
	in the interest of Islamic revolutions all over the world, and continues to 
	do so. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Algeria, known for its Islamic civil 
	war continues with its Islamic horrors. Islamic absolutism and 
	totalitarianism is imposed with guns and slaughters in the interest of 
	religion of Islam. Men are usually killed for their religio-political crimes 
	while women are killed just for the crime of being a woman in an Islamic 
	country. Thousands were islamically raped and more than 500 were killed only 
	in 1993. Women have been killed for not wearing hijab (veil) or refusing to 
	do so when imposed, for refusing to engage in Iranian-style temporary 
	marriage, for being married to foreign men, and for working and living 
	alone. The victims have been as young as 9 years and as old as 69 years. 
	Women are often raped and tortured before being slaughtered. Thousands find 
	themselves imprisoned in Islamic camps for no legitimate reasons. It is 
	worth mentioning that women had a respectable status in society before the 
	conquest of Algeria by Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Egyptians, heir to the great 
	Pharonic and Alexandrian civilizations continue to suffer the chronic evil 
	of Islam. Known for the miseries of hijab and female genital mutilation, 
	Egypt is also a centre of child prostitution for the wealthy Saudi Islamic 
	Bedouins. In Egypt, four out of five women are forced to wear some kind of 
	hijab. Female genital mutilation is very common; up to 73% in Cairo and 95% 
	in rural areas. In 1995 a shaikh (religious dignity) of Al-Azhar University 
	Cairo issued a fatwa (the religious decree or bill), which reportedly 
	announced the procedure pf Female Genital Mutilation as &quot;laudable practice 
	that does honour to women&quot;; and stating that it was, a religious duty as 
	important as praying to Allah. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sudan had a long history of Islamic 
	conquest and repression. Islamic totalitarianism and barbarity continues to 
	this day. Recently, Sudan was brutalized by the Saudi-backed Gen.Numeri's 
	Islamic fascism. In 1992 a religious decree-fatwa-was issued that gave 
	justification to the military onslaught against the non-Muslims. Islamic 
	barbarism and genocide continues in Darfur to this day. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indonesian Islamic army 
	mass-murdered 200,000 East Timurian non-Muslims before East Timur got its 
	independent. The country is known for its extreme religiosity, corruption, 
	ethno-religious problems and Islamic extremism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pakistan, an experimental laboratory 
	of Islam, had turned into a horror. Notwithstanding the hundreds of 
	thousands of rapes, abductions and murders under the watchful eyes of the 
	very Christian administration of the Holy Roman British Empire at the time 
	of religious division of the Indian sub-continent in 1947 by the Christian 
	British Empire, when half a million people were forced to migrate, Pakistan 
	has never made any certain move towards civilization. Pakistan is a centre 
	of Islamic fundamentalism, extremism and terrorism. Pakistan's very Islamic 
	army invaded her province of East Pakistan in 1971, killing hundreds of 
	thousands of Bengali Muslims and non-Muslims and raping half a million women 
	ranging 9-69 years in age, in its attempt to create a half breed Pak-Bengal 
	race which would be loyal to Islam and Pakistan. In 1974 Pakistan army 
	invaded its province of Baluchistan resulting in similar calamities. In 1980 
	Islamist General Zia ul Haq introduced further islamization under the Saudi 
	pressure for introduction of the medieval and tribal Islamic Shariah.. Along 
	with the compulsory public prayers, there were brutal Islamic laws for the 
	very natural sexual acts and for the presumed blasphemy: the repressive 
	Hudood Ordinance and the infamous Blasphemy laws. Thousands of innocent 
	women continue to suffer under these and other Islamic fascist laws for mere 
	allegations. Raped women had been sent to gallows for the crime of being 
	raped. (Islamic Shariah is the only system of law, which punishes the 
	victims: Fatemollah). Pakistani state has proved to be a willing and 
	sinister instrument of the evil Islamic mullah fascism and terrorism. 
	Pakistan created the hated Afghan Taliban and many other such organizations 
	in Afghanistan. Similar organizations continue to flourish in Pakistan and 
	try to create a totalitarian and fascist Islamic state. Despite all tall 
	claims of fight against Islamic terrorism, the evil continues to flourish. 
	Pakistan is undoubtedly a major source of supply for the Iraqi terrorism. 
	Illicit drug trade continues with the blessings of the Islamic mullahs and 
	the ISI (the Islamic Military Intelligence). There are Islamic prostitution 
	centres in every Islamic city of the Islamic Pakistan where abducted and 
	non-Muslim women are forced to suffer. The secular, liberal and rationalist 
	intellectuals continue to suffer in Pakistan like the victims of the 
	infamous Christian inquisition of medieval Europe. While the Christian 
	churches burnt the heretics, Islamic mullahs get them indicted for 
	Blasphemy. </font></p>
