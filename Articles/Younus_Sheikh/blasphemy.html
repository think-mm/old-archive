    <p align="justify"><font color="#800000" face="Verdana"><b>Blasphemy </b>
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims are the first victims of 
    Islamism. In a novel and unethical way, Pakistani Mullahs have started 
    abusing the dreadful Islamic Blasphemy laws to terrorise liberal and 
    moderate Muslims. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am a Pakistani doctor, a 
    physiologist, a patriotic and law-abiding citizen, a Muslim by birth. I 
    trained as a surgeon and worked for some years in the United Kingdom. I gave 
    up my job in the UK in order to return to Pakistan to serve the people of my 
    own country. I obtained a position as a lecturer in Physiology at the 
    Capital Homeopathic Hospital, Islamabad. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of my reasons for returning to 
    Pakistan was to campaign for Human Rights and civil liberties in Pakistan: 
    to work for the Pakistan-India peace movement, to struggle for liberalism, 
    secularism and humanism, and to counter the forces of religious extremism 
    and fundamentalism. </font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#800000" face="Verdana"><b>My Case </b>
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On 1st October 2000 I attended a 
    meeting of the South Asian Union in Islamabad on the topic of 
    Pakistani-India Relations and Nuclear War. In a statement from the floor of 
    the meeting I expressed the view that Pakistan and India should agree that 
    in the interest of the people of Kashmir, that the present line of 
    demarcation should become the peace line: the international border between 
    the two countries. I also expressed the view that if Pakistan continued to 
    support freedom fighters- terrorists - in our neighboring country, then 
    our neighbor might respond in a similar way, culminating in a new calamity 
    like the one we experienced in the 1971 Civil War and the loss of East 
    Pakistan. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Following my statement, Mr. Shaukat 
    Qadir, a Brigadier from military intelligence, the ISI, (now an employee of 
    SDPI Islamabad and a Columnist with the Daily Times, Lahore-Pakistan) 
    threatened me and said that he would crush the heads of those who think and 
    talk like that. </font></p>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="jail.jpg" width="138" height="167"></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Two days later, I was called into 
    the office of the principal of the college and was summarily dismissed from 
    my job without notice. No reason was given. On 4th October, I received a 
    message asking me to present myself in the principals office. I did so, and 
    was immediately handed over to the police. I was arrested on a charge of 
    blasphemy. The complaint had been filed under section 295/ C of the Pakistan 
    Penal Code by a Muslim cleric of the Majlis Tahaffuz Khatm-i-Nabuwat 
    (Committee for the Finality of the Prophethood) with the added suspicion 
    that I might belong to the heretical Ahmedi community. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The charges against me centred on 
    some utterances I was alleged to have made in the course of a lecture at the 
    college on 2nd October 2000, that neither the Prophet of Islam nor his 
    parents could have been Muslims before Islam was revealed to the Prophet. I 
    was also alleged to have said that the Prophet was unlikely to have shaved 
    under his armpits since the custom was probably unknown to his tribe at the 
    time. These remarks were interpreted by my accusers, the Mullahs, as an 
    insult to the Prophet. I did not actually make the alleged remarks. The 
    mullahs themselves never heard me make any such remarks, nor did they 
    investigate whether any such incident had ever occurred. In fact, I gave no 
    lecture at the time alleged. During the course of the trial the chief 
    witness against me was totally discredited. He admitted that he was not 
    actually present in the college on the day the alleged remarks were made.
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#800000" face="Verdana"><b>My trial </b>
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If you are accused of blasphemy in 
    Pakistan, you will usually be denied bail and held in custody until trial. 
    If found guilty, you will face a mandatory death sentence. My trial was held 
    in a series of sessions throughout the summer of 2001. Although neither a 
    body of crime was established nor did the evidence prove any occurrence of 
    blasphemy, I was pronounced guilty on 18th August 2001, fined 100,000 
    rupees, and sentenced to death - nearly nine months after my arrest. </font>
    </p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The specific charge on which I was 
    found guilty was Insulting the Prophet. To many European observers it 
    might seem illogical that death sentence could be awarded without proving 
    the incidence or establishing the body of crime, however, that is the way 
    blasphemy cases are adjudicated upon in the very Islamic Republic of 
    Pakistan. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For the next two years, I was held 
    in solitary confinement in a very small death cell in the Central Jail, 
    Rawalpindi, a dark and dirty death cell with unbearable, stinking and 
    distasteful food. There was no facility for walking or exercise, and I was 
    without books, newspapers, medication or treatment for my worsening 
    diabetes. I remained constantly under threat of murder by Islamic 
    fundamentalist inmates in jail for murder and gang rape, and by some 
    religiously-minded prison warders. I appealed. My appeal was heard over 
    several sessions lasting 15 long months before the two judges managed to 
    disagree over their verdict, one Islamic/minded judge rejected the appeal 
    without giving any legal grounds for doing so, while the other legal-minded 
    judge stated that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond 
    reasonable doubt and that the witnesses were neither trustworthy nor 
    reliable. The referee High Court judge took another year and sent the case 
    for retrial. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The retrial was held in November 
    2003 at the Court of the Session in Islamabad. Because of threats and 
    harassment no lawyer was ready to plead my case, and I was forced to defend 
    myself for survival, which I did after secretly smuggling law books into my 
    death cell. At the retrial the courtroom was full of mullahs and the 
    Pakistani Taliban. The two mullah advocates and the Public Prosecutor tried 
    to exploit the religious feelings of the court but I confined my defense to 
    legal arguments. I was inspired by the defense speech of Sir Thomas More in 
    A Man for All Seasons. Fortunately the outcome in my case was different. The 
    judge accepted my legal arguments and found charges against me baseless. My 
    accusers, the two Mullahs and the Islamist students had lied under oath.
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was acquitted on 21st November 
    2003. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#800000" face="Verdana"><b>My Ordeal </b>
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I feel I have been a victim of 
    Islamic Mullah terrorism through he abuse of the state apparatus and the 
    civil law. My first trial was a show trial almost reminiscent of the trials 
    and tortures of the infamous Spanish inquisition, and the trials and burning 
    of European women as witches. After my acquittal and release, I wanted to 
    stay in my country with my family and friends but instead I found myself 
    under a fatwa by the same mullahs that I should be killed. I had to say 
    goodbye to my loved ones and flee to Europe for my safety. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am very thankful to the 
    International Humanist and Ethical Union, the various humanist organisations 
    and individual humanists,&nbsp; Mukto-Mona&nbsp; and all of the other human 
    rights organisations who campaigned on my behalf: Amnesty International, 
    Physicians for Human Rights USA, the Jubilee Campaign USA, and the many 
    honorable senators and congressmen from the United States, and UK members of 
    parliament. I also want to thank the Swiss and US embassies in Islamabad and 
    the Swiss government for their ceaseless support for justice and equity in 
    my case. I am very grateful to the Swiss government for granting me refugee 
    status in Switzerland. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#800000" face="Verdana"><b>What is 
    blasphemy? </b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What then constitutes blasphemy? 
    Unfortunately the Pakistani Penal Code provides little guidance. The law is 
    vague and the term is undefined. In view of the mandatory death penalty for 
    the offence this would seem to be an important oversight. The law is a relic 
    of 1860 British colonial criminal law, but was modified in 1926 again under 
    the British, then in 1986 by General Zia to make it more strictly in 
    accordance with the Sharia, and finally in 1992 when the death penalty was 
    made mandatory  this under the democratically-elected prime minister Nawaz 
    Sharif. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whereas the original law had been 
    even-handed and applied equally to all religions, under the revised law the 
    death penalty applies only to blasphemy against Islam. More than a hundred 
    victims are currently in jail awaiting trial, 15 of whom face the death 
    penalty under section 295C of the Pakistan Penal Code. Mercifully, none have 
    so far been executed. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In another famous case, a Christian, 
    Ayub Masih was condemned to death for blasphemy on the unsupported evidence 
    of a neighbour, Muhammad Akram who was involved with him in a land dispute 
    and who was awarded property belonging to the accused after the case was 
    decided. The verdict and sentence were upheld by the Lahore High Court on 
    July 25, 2001. However, after seven long years of unnecessary incarceration 
    in the death cell, he was found innocent and acquitted by the Supreme Court.
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Despite their successes in obtaining 
    convictions, the fundamentalists have not been willing to leave judgement 
    and execution to the courts. Several people have been murdered by Islamic 
    zealots after having been acquitted by the courts. Others accused of 
    blasphemy have been murdered in jail while awaiting trial and even a High 
    Court judge was murdered after finding one prisoner not guilty. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font color="#800000" face="Verdana"><b>Pakistans shame
    </b></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The blasphemy law has brought shame 
    on Pakistan. The law itself is unjust and inequitable, the offence it treats 
    is poorly defined and open to abuse, and its operation has been widely 
    misused and abused. Since the introduction of Sharia law in Pakistan in 
    1986, the blasphemy law has been used on hundreds of occasions by 
    fundamentalists to silence moderate opponents, to intimidate non-Muslims and 
    to settle personal scores. </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While praising President General 
    Pervez Musharraf for his liberal and secular steps, and for his courageous 
    fight against Islamic Jihadi terrorism, I appeal to him to curb this menace 
    of Islamic Mullah terrorism: the abuse of Pakistani Islamic blasphemy laws. 
    I call upon the Commission on Human Rights to press the government of 
    Pakistan: </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1) to urgently review the cases of 
    all those currently charged or convicted of blasphemy and awaiting 
    execution, including an urgent judicial review of all cases currently sub-judice;
    </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2) to immediately review the
