	<em>Dr. Younus Shaikh</em></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before the advent of Islam, the pagan Arab women generally enjoyed a 
	respectable status in society; many of them Khadija- the first wife of the 
	prophet of Islam, had the right to engage in business and choose or dismiss 
	their husbands in a matrilineal fashion; they took part in most activities 
	of war and peace including public worship. In female oriented Arab paganism, 
	goddesses had special status; in Mecca, the female goddess Al-Uzza, in Taif 
	the goddess Al-Lat and in Medina the goddess Manat were the most popular 
	deities, and their statues were most revered while the statue of the stern 
	Allah was almost neglected. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Arab pagan poetry was mostly concerned with the beauty and grace of their 
	women, and the glory of their tribal values in peace and war. And it was 
	only in one predator tribe of Mecca that the evil custom of burying alive of 
	the daughters prevailed. It was highly unusual for a man of pre-Islamic Arab 
	society to have more than one wife in his house; and it is quite certain 
	that polygamy was introduced and encouraged by the prophet after the 
	revelation of Islam. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Women were to produce as many Muslims as possible. This Ultimately 
	resulted in the degradation in the status of the married woman in the 
	Islamic society. Whereas the pre-Islamic Arab custom allowed many looser 
	forms of marriage on the matrilineal and matri-local tradition that gave the 
	woman freedom and liberty as full human being, however the artificial rules 
	of Islamic nikah reduced marriage to mere sexual and social slavery. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The prophet of Islam, before prophet-hood, opposed the burying alive of 
	the newborn daughters; he was eager to work for a woman and gladly married a 
	divorced woman. The early Islam continued with most of the pre-Islam tribal 
	traditions; there were for examples no hijabs or veils for women of Madina; 
	and at a later date only the nine wives of prophets were restricted in their 
	social intercourse as their home was constantly full of visitors, however 
	the prophets women sex-slaves were not restricted in any such manners.
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indeed, the semi-transparent half-face- veil (hijab) was actually a very 
	old custom originating in the Assyrian times, a status symbol and a mark of 
	social distinction for the free women. The pre-Islamic pagan Arab woman of 
	the cities often wore the fashionable semi-transparent half-face veil but 
	the tribal women never did. Later, Islam added measures for the 
	preservation of modesty F or women-like casting down their eyes in public, 
	concealing their breasts and jewellery and the likes. However, these 
	restrictions were later extended by the followers of the prophet far beyond 
	his original intentions as expressed in Koran, and remained more or less a 
	permanent fixture of Muslim life thereafter. Later on, however, the 
	insecurity of early Islam gradually added to the exclusion of women, and 100 
	years later, by the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Haroon ur Rashid, women 
	became merely sexual toys and breeding machines; and as married women they 
	were merely maidservants- mere mans social appendages. Moreover, as female 
	sex-slaves, women were freely bought and sold in open markets of all Islamic 
	countries, and loaned, rented or bestowed as gifts to friends. The prophet 
	himself bestowed women sex-slaves to his favorites. There was no limit to 
	the number of slaves one could own; one of the companions of prophet Hazrat 
	Zubair Ibn ul Arvan, for example, had had 1000 men-slaves and 1000 women 
	sex-slaves. Islam took the woman as the land tilled by the man where he 
	spilled his seeds. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The prophet himself took part or guided nearly 100 wars or raids or 
	attacks for plunder. After him, his followers continued the offence. The 
	fierce Islamic tribal Bedouins with centuries long experience of ruthless 
	and cruel tribal warfare proved to be the worthwhile shock troops of Islam. 
	After Iraq, Syria fell to the Islamic Empire in 634 CE. Despite surrenders, 
	great massacres took place at many places; thousands of men were slaughtered 
	and women and children sold into slavery; monasteries were ransacked, monks 
	and villagers were slain and nuns were raped. After the conquest of Egypt, 
	many of its towns were put to sword and their entire population wiped out. 
	Great massacres also occurred in Cyprus and North Africa. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Roman province of Iraq, the Syrian province of Iran, and the 
	conquered Iran brought hundreds of thousands of men-slaves, women 
	sex-slaves, and the vast fertile lands of these once mighty and civilized 
	countries where the women had been held in high respect e.g. the 
	Manichaecian Iraq, the Pharonic Egypt and North African Civilizations.
	</font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As in Egypt and Iran, wherever the conquering Islamic Bedouins armies 
	went, they destroyed the local civilizations cultures, imposed their Islamic 
	tribal medievalism recklessly murdering men and degrading women to perpetual 
	sexual slavery. In short, the Islamic tribal Bedouins and barbarians did the 
	same to the surrounding higher civilizations what the Roman barbarians did 
	to the highly civilized ancient Greeks. Meanwhile the Islamic Bedouins 
	continued to raid and abduct the European women for Islamic slave markets 
	during all these Islamic centuries. The conquest of Syria forced the 
	conversion of thousands of Christian priests to Islam, who changed their 
	religion but not their profession: they became the stern anti-feminine 
	Islamic mullahs and not only continued their religious magic and rituals but 
	also continued the essentially Christian medievalism under Islam. In short, 
	as a result of these conquests, destructions and imposition of Islamic 
	tribal medievalism, societies under the Islamic Empire went further than any 
	other in their total exclusion of women from political power and social 
	influence. Islamic legislation went far beyond anything the prophet had 
	originally dreamed of in his tribal religiosity in cheating women of their 
	rightful place in society and in matters of inheritance. Where originally 
	the Koran gave women the right if inheritance, the Islamic mullah invented 
	the legalized institution of Waqf- the religious foundation, to exclude the 
	daughters and their descendents from inheritance. Though the Koran does give 
	the right of inheritance to women, she continued to be a minor; usually 
	uneducated needing a guardian in father, husband or the son. Indeed, the 
	status of women in Islam is theoretically exalted but utterly deplorable in 
	practice. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Multiplying number of harems (residing place for the female sex-slaves), 
	finally institutionalized under Caliph Al-Walid II, emphasized the 
	inevitable degradation of womanhood under Islam. Haroon ur Rashid, the 
	Islamic Caliph (ruler) had 2000 female sex-slaves, Caliph Mutwakkal had 4000 
	female sex-slaves; and every mullah, official or soldier of Islamic state 
	had some men-slaves and women sex-slaves belonging to the conquered 
	civilization nations. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not being allowed to learn, experience or think for herself, it is no 
	wonder that there are hardly very few outstanding women in 1600 years of 
	Islamic history, and those who by chance or by the force of the ancient 
	pre-Islamic customs came into light or in the corridors of power were sooner 
	or later eliminated on the orders of some pious and religious Islamic 
	mullah.. Indeed, Islams violent anti-feminism have been as nefarious as 
	Christianitys burning of hundreds of thousands European women as witches in 
	15th, 16th and 17th century. The female hating instruments of the Islamic 
	Empire, the mullahs and the Caliphs, continued to promote degradation of 
	women under the formal and sordid Islamic legal code of Shariah, the final 
	seal on the complete subjection of the female element. The modern history of 
	Islam is merely the continuation of the Islamic tribal medievalism, only the 
	technology , phraseology and the façade is modern. </font> </p>
