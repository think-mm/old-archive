	March, 2005. This was the first in a series in which it is hoped that 
	concerned citizens will meet to discuss the present situation in Bangladesh.

	Most observers will agree that the current condition of Bangladesh – as 
	reflected in the slide into lawlessness and the climate of impunity, State 
	acquiescence to the growth of terrorist power, open corruption and 
	maladministration, growing inequality, and the politicization and breakdown 
	of some of the key institutions of the country - reflect more than just 
	incompetence on the part of the current Government. There appears to be a 
	concerted effort to undermine the foundations upon which our Republic was 
	established. In recent months there has been growing recognition of the need 
	to develop a coalition of interests aimed at halting the current downward 
	spiral and thwarting those who would seek to challenge the fundamental 
	beliefs which underpinned the creation of our State.</p>

	There is generally little divergence of views as to what is wrong in our 
	country today. The only groups that deny that there is a problem are those 
	blinded by party loyalties and those driven by mercenary interests (i.e., 
	those who are gaining financially from the current regime). There have been 
	endless seminars, workshops and roundtable discussions on our nation’s 
	problems and the key issues have been quite clearly identified by now. What 
	I feel has been lacking in many such discussions is a sense of direction as 
	to the way out of the current national crisis. There is a sense of 
	helplessness and hopelessness within large sections of our citizens, given 
	the magnitude and the breadth of problems we face. Where do we begin?</p>

	&nbsp;There is a joke going around about a meeting between the Prime Ministers of 
	Bangladesh and Singapore. The Singapore PM tells our PM that if he was given 
	the chance to run our country he could turn it into Singapore in ten years. 
	That’s nothing, our PM smilingly replies, “Give me the chance to run 
	Singapore and I will turn it into Bangladesh in ten days”. Jokes apart, this 
	highlights a valid point: it takes a long time to build institutional 
	structures and a system of governance, but these can be destroyed very 
	quickly. Of course, Singapore is a city-state without a genuine pluralist 
	democracy, so there is no suggestion that it’s example should be copied 
	without question. However, Singapore has certainly developed a system of 
	governance that has features we could adopt in this country. We should also 
	draw upon international “good practice” - perhaps looking to the 
	Scandinavian countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand that are widely 
	recognized as models of governance and citizen’s rights.</p>

	There is a serious crisis of confidence in this country. Ordinary citizens 
	have become bitter and cynical about the Government and to some extent 
	politicians in general. I am not worried so much about people’s lack of awe 
	for politicians. This is probably a good thing. In both the United States 
	and Australia, for example, ordinary people have a healthy dose of cynicism 
	about the rulers in Washington and Canberra. What is worrying is the total 
	contempt that people in Bangladesh have developed – particularly in the past 
	three years – regarding those who run our Government. People are not 
	surprised when senior Government leaders are caught lying outright, or make 
	preposterous statements denying responsibility for their actions, or are 
	openly accused of corruption. It is worrying that some of these leaders have 
	made a travesty of the concept of “public service”, bringing the entire 
	system of governance into disrepute. </p>

	The cynicism and sense of partisanship that now pervades this country has 
	reached levels where I would argue that it is difficult to name even twenty 
	persons that are respected and trusted by a large majority (say 
	three-quarters) of our citizens. Reputations are purposefully attacked by 
	partisan groups and everyone’s integrity is questioned. Who are the “heroes” 
	and role models of our society – the Bill Gates, Stephen Hawkings and Steven 
	Spielbergs – whose success and achievements inspire us to excel in our 
	fields? Every nation has its own heroes and this choice does reveal 
	something important about the national character. &nbsp;</p>

	There have been political leaders that inspire adulation – Bangabandhu 
	Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, John F. Kennedy and Nelson Mandela for example – but 
	these examples are rare. I noted a newspaper report the other day that the 
	Speaker was discussing the need to introduce legislation making it possible 
	to prosecute people (for “contempt”) who criticize legislators. Mr. Speaker, 
	there are some things you just cannot obtain by decree or law – and the 
	people’s respect is one of them. There is a question that small children 
	used to be asked in the United States, “What do you want to be when you grow 
	up?” The answer commonly was “President”, “Governor” or “Senator”. The 
	problem is that in Bangladesh we lack political leaders we even respect, let 
	alone regard as role models. Can anyone imagine a child in this country 
	saying that he wants to be like Messrs. Mannan Bhuiyan or Jamiruddin Sircar 
	when he grows up?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	How are the desired changes in our system of economic and social governance 
	to be achieved? What would be the possible modalities for change? There are 
	a few lonely voices calling for approaches that go outside the current 
	political framework but I do not think this has wide popular appeal. I fear 
	that any attempt to do so wastes the energies of otherwise sincere people. 
	It helps no one to reject reality in the pursuit of some unattainable ideal 
	– and I would refer those who believe in the necessity of revolution to the 
	lyrics of the song by that name written by Lennon and McCartney.&nbsp; </p>

	I would suggest that any serious attempt to tackle this country’s problems 
	cannot by-pass the existing major political parties of the country. These 
	parties have many faults but we must work to improve them rather than reject 
	the products of the democratic process. Of course it will be essential to 
	guard against any attempt to subvert the voting process to ensure that the 
	will of the people is accurately reflected in the electoral process, but 
	that is another issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	However, other stakeholders – smaller political parties, civil society, our 
	universities, professional groups – can certainly play a more prominent role 
	in the process of change. The smaller parties in particular have a chance to 
	shape the future political landscape if they can put forward innovative 
	answers to the nation’s problems. In the battle of ideas that lies ahead 
	there will be electoral rewards for those capable of “thinking outside the 
	box” and articulating the will of the people in an effective manner. </p>

	Who would support the planning and implementation of necessary reforms? 
	There may be a role for independent commissions, research agencies and 
	perhaps even scope for collaboration with international NGOs working in the 
	legal and governance areas. We need to consider what would be the future 
	role of local research institutions and NGOs in this process. How closely, 
	for example, is their independence from the Government compromised through 
	consultancy work, funding and other arrangements? Primary school teachers 
	may be a powerful potential force for change. These individuals already play 
	a critical role in our society (particularly rural society) as leaders and 
	opinion-makers and they must be at the forefront of any serious effort to 
	inculcate values of democracy and tolerance in our society.</p>

	There is a need to go beyond the urban elites for opinions. The vast 
	majority of our people may not have had the same opportunities for higher 
	education that the privileged few in this country have had, but I do believe 
	the innate common sense of our ordinary citizens will yield constructive 
	ideas for reform. A way must be developed to ensure that wide public 
	participation in debates and consultations on the reform agenda.&nbsp; Given the 
	size of our country this may be a messy and difficult process but that is 
	what genuinely participatory approaches require. One supplementary method 
	would be to use opinion surveys to systematically gauge public opinion and

	</span><u>The Election System</u>: Most would agree this is the most 
	important issue facing the country today. Ensuring that the people’s will is 
	accurately reflected in the electoral process is essential if people are to 
	retain confidence in democratic processes. Clearly the existing system is 
	too susceptible to manipulation through the channels of the Chief of the 
	Caretaker Government, the Election Commission, and a partisan President. 
	What is the nature of the solution? Perhaps it is the development of 
	institutional checks and balances or the provision of independent authority 
	to the Election Commission. Or is a more radical temporary solution the 
	answer? Additionally there are numerous serious flaws in the mechanics of 
	the voting, vote counting and results-reporting process – these are all 
	serious issues. Also, what should be the role of the security agencies in 
	the election process?&nbsp; </p>

	</span><u>Legal Reform</u>: When the Law Minister of Bangladesh publicly 
	defends the practice of extra-judicial killings, even the most biased 
	observer will have figured out that we do have a problem here. The 
	unfortunate situation of a stream of judges being” embarrassed” has also 
	created serious concerns. Is there any guarantee of justice for our 
	citizens? Will killers be allowed to escape with impunity? There must be a 
	place we can turn to for relief and protection when all other national 
	institutions have failed us, and it is the courts that must play this role 
	until our other institutions recover. Legal reform must receive recognition 
	as a political priority. There are various projects focusing on legal 
	training and infrastructure issues – to this I would add a proposal to raise 
	judges’ salaries very substantially. Initially we may have an “adverse 
	selection” problem – some legal officers may not have joined the profession 
	for all the right reasons, so that some recipients of the high salaries may 
	not, strictly speaking, be deserving of them. It is important, however, to 
	at least get the market signals right.</p>

	</span><u>The Rise of Islamic Fundamentalist Groups in Bangladesh under the 
	BNP-Jamaat-i-Islami Government</u>: the Government’s “mysterious” failure to

	capability of the Government to deal with this menace are matters of grave

	</span><u>Local Government Reform</u>. I believe that genuine devolution of 
	financial and administrative authority to elected local governments 
	represents the only sustainable way of developing truly representative and 
	accountable institutions of governance in Bangladesh. This will mean an end 
	to the Dhaka-centric system of government that currently exists. The 
	dilution of the authority of elected public representatives at the national 
	levels is bound to be resisted, but such an initiative would be popular. The 
	conventional wisdom is that jurisdictions of about 6 million people are 
	among the best governed as this size makes it practical to have high levels 
	of participation, responsiveness to citizen’s needs and accountability (see: 
	World Bank, <i>Government That Works</i>, Dhaka, 1996).&nbsp; </p>

	</span><u>Reform of Campaign Funding</u>: The current hypocrisy of campaign 
	funding must come to an end – the sources of funding must be made more 
	transparent and realistic spending limits for parliamentary campaigns need 
	to be introduced. Why are the types of people we now see in Parliament the 
	only ones that can prevail under the current system of political contests? 
	It is said that a nation gets the Government it deserves, but surely no 
	nation deserves to have people like Messrs. Saifur Rahman, M.R. Nizami or 
	Khondokar Musharref Hossain as MPs? How can more people genuinely committed 
	to public service enter Parliament – is there no way of checking the 
	tendency of it becoming a “millionaire’s club”? Incidentally, my father had 
	written about this phenomenon some years back, but perhaps the sense of 
	public dissatisfaction with this situation is not that strong. How do we 
	ensure that honorable people become willing to go through the bruising (and 
	dangerous) process of becoming a Member of Parliament? Is there a need for 
	an Upper House composed of those who have already distinguished themselves 
	through a record of public service?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	address the need to improve teaching performance in the public educational 
	system and strengthen the teaching of English. It may also be time to 
	consider modernizing the infrastructure and curricula of the <i>madrassahs</i>, 
	perhaps along the lines of what is being undertaken in Pakistan.</p>

	the morale of our civil service, which must regain confidence in their role 
	as servants of the Republic. It is important to break the current mentality
