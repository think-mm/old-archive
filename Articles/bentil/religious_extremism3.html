  <p><font face="Arial">The RSO's main military camp was located near the
  hospital that the Rabitat had built at Ukhia. At the time, the RSO acquired a
  substantial number of Chinese made RPG-2 rocket launchers, light machine-guns,
  AK-47 assault rifles, claymore mines and explosives from private arms dealers
  in the Thai town of Aranyaprathet near Thailand's border with Cambodia, which
  in the 1980s emerged as a major arms bazaar for guerrilla movements in the
  region. These weapons were siphoned off from Chinese arms shipments to the
  resistance battling the Vietnamese army in Cambodia, and sold to any one who
  wanted, and could afford, to buy them. (37) The Bangladeshi media gave quite
  extensive coverage to the RSO buildup along the border, but it soon became
  clear that it was not only Rohingyas who underwent training in its camps.
  Many, it turned out, were members of ICS and came from the University of
  Chittagong, where a &quot;campus war&quot; was being fought between Islamic
  militants and more moderate student groups. (38) The RSO was, in fact, engaged
  in little or no fighting inside Burma.<br>
  <br>
  There was also a more moderate faction among the Rohingyas in Bangladesh, the
  Arakan Rohingya Islamic Front (ARIF), which was set up in 1986, uniting the
  remnants of the old RPF and a handful of defectors from the RSO. It was led by
  Nurul Islam, a Rangoon-educated lawyer. But it never had more than a few dozen
  soldiers, mostly equipped with elderly, UK-made 9mm Sterling L2A3 sub-machine
  guns, bolt action .303 rifles and a few M-16 assault rifles.39 In 1998, it
  became the Arakan Rohingya National Organization (ARNO), maintaining its
  moderate stance and barely surviving in exile in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar.<br>
  <br>
  The expansion of the RSO in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and the
  unprecedented publicity the group attracted in the local and international
  media, prompted the Burmese government to launch a massive counter-offensive
  to &quot;clear up&quot; the border area. In December 1991, Burmese troops
  crossed the border and attacked a Bangladeshi military outpost. The incident
  developed into a major crisis in Bangladesh-Burma relations, and by April 1992
  more than 250,000 Rohingya civilians had been forced out of Arakan.<br>
  <br>
  Hardly by coincidence, this second massive exodus of Rohingyas occurred at a
  time when Burma was engulfed in a major political crisis. The pro-democracy
  National League for Democracy (NLD) had won a landslide victory in a general
  election in May 1990, but the country's military government refused to convene
  the elected assembly. There were anti-government demonstrations in the
  northern city of Mandalay, and the ruling Burmese junta was condemned
  internationally.<br>
  <br>
  The Rohingya refugees were housed in a string of makeshift camps south of
  Cox's Bazar, prompting the Bangladeshi government to appeal for help from the
  international community. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
  UNHCR, came in to run the camps and to negotiate with the Burmese government
  for the return of the Rohingyas. In April 1992, prince Khaled Sultan Abdul
  Aziz, commander of the Saudi contingent in the 1991 Gulf War, visited Dhaka
  and recommended a Desert Storm-like action against Burma, &quot;just what [the
  UN] did to liberate Kuwait.&quot; (40)<br>
  <br>
  That, of course, did never happen, and the Burmese government, under pressure
  from the United Nations, eventually agreed to take most of the refugees back.
  But an estimated 20,000 destitute refugees remain in two camps between Cox's
  Bazar and the border. In addition, an undisclosed number of Rohingyas, perhaps
  as many as 100,000-150,000, continue to live outside the UNHCR-supervised
  camps. There is little doubt that extremist groups have taken advantage of the
  disenfranchised Rohingyas, including recruiting them as cannon fodder for Al-Qaeda
  in Afghanistan and elsewhere. In an interview with the Karachi-based
  newspaper, Ummat on September 28, 2001, bin Laden said: &quot;There are areas
  in all parts of the world where strong jihadi forces are present, from Bosnia
  to Sudan, and from Burma to Kashmir.&quot; (41) He was most probably referring
  to a small group of Rohingyas on the Bangladesh-Burma border.<br>
  <br>
  Many of the Rohingya recruits were given the most dangerous task in the
  battlefield, clearing mines and portering. According to Asian intelligence
  sources, Rohingya recruits were paid 30,000 Bangladeshi taka ($525) on joining
  and then 10,000 ($175) per month. The families of recruits killed in action
  were offered 100,000 taka ($1,750). (42) Recruits were taken mostly via Nepal
  to Pakistan, where they were trained and send on to military camps in
  Afghanistan. It is not known how many people from this part of Bangladesh -
  Rohingyas and others - fought in Afghanistan, but it is believed to be quite
  substantial. Others went to Kashmir and even Chechnya to join forces with
  Islamic militants there. (43)<br>
  <br>
  In an interview with the CNN in December 2001, American &quot;taliban&quot;
  fighter, John Walker Lindh, relate that the Al-Qaeda-directed ansar
  (companions of the Prophet) brigades, to which he had belonged in Afghanistan,
  were divided along linguistic lines: &quot;Bengali, Pakistani (Urdu) and
  Arabic,&quot; which suggests that the Bengali-speaking component - Bangladeshi
  and Rohingya - must have been significant. (44) In early 2002, Afghanistan's
  foreign minister, Dr. Abdullah, told a Western journalist that &quot;we have
  captured one Malaysian and one or two supporters from Burma.&quot; (45)<br>
  <br>
  In January 2001, Bangladesh clamped down on Rohingya activists and offices in
  Chittagong and Cox's Bazar, most probably in an attempt to improve relations
  with Burma. Hundreds were rounded up, and the local press was full of reports
  of their alleged involvement in gun- and drug-running. Rohingya leaders
  vehemently deny such accusations, and blame local Bangladeshi gangs with
  high-level connections for the violence in the area. But the Rohingyas were
  forced to evacuate their military camps, which had always been located on the
  Bangladesh side of the border. Recent reports from the area suggest that HUJI
  and other Bangladeshi Islamic groups have taken over these camps, with the
  main base being the one the RSO used to maintain near the Rabitat-built
  hospital in Ukhia. (46)<br>

  <br>
  <b>4. Attacks on Secular Muslims and Religious Minorities<br>
  </b><br>
  What now is Bangladesh - and initially East Bengal and then East Pakistan -
  has undergone some dramatic demographic changes during the past sixty years.
  According to the 1941 Census of India, Hindus made up 28% of the population of
  then East Bengal. Twenty years later, when East Pakistan was well-established,
  the number had decreased to 18.5%. More left during the liberation war in
  1971, when the Pakistani army targeted Hindus especially. By 1974, only 13.5%
  of the population of independent Bangladesh was Hindu. According to the latest
  estimate, the figure is now down to 9%. (47) At the same time, large numbers
  of Buddhists from the Chittagong Hill Tracts - Bangladesh's other main
  religious minority - have fled to India.<br>
  <br>
  The fall of the Awami League and the murder of Mujib-ur Rahman in August 1975,
  followed by the military takeover by Maj.-Gen. Zia in November of that year,
  ushered in a new era of Bangladeshi nationalism, where the religious and
  ethnic minorities had little or no place. Mujib's immediate successor,
  Khondkar Mushtaq Ahmed, who was a senior member of the Awami League but known
  for his Islamic and pro-Pakistan leanings, began to conclude his speeches with
  Bangladesh Zindabad (long live Bangladesh, but &quot;zindabad&quot; is a
  Persian word) rather than the war cry of the liberation struggle, Joi Bangla
  (both words being Bengali). This soon became common practice in government
  announcements and radio broadcasts.<br>
  <br>
  A shift in foreign policy was also noticeable. Bangladesh's first government
  had emphasized friendship with India and the Soviet Union. Zia's government
  steered Bangladesh closer to Pakistan, China and Saudi-Arabia. (48) Pakistan's
  intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) became active in
  Bangladesh again, working closely with its local counterpart, the Directorate
  General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI). Pakistan never fully recovered from the
  loss of East Pakistan, and never forgave India for the role it played in the
  birth of Bangladesh by sending troops to fight the Pakistani army.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="banalee_taliban7.jpg" width="422" height="450"></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><br>
  <br>
  The idea of Bangladesh rejoining Pakistan was out of the question after the
  extremely bloody liberation war, in which millions died. But Pakistan was
  determined to regain its influence over its former eastern part and,
  especially, to keep Indian influence there at an absolute minimum. Zia's
  policies, including allowing the Jamaat to return, served these interests, and
  the Pakistanis, quite naturally, emphasized the main bond that united the two
  countries: Islam.<br>
  <br>
  Historian M.G. Kabir argues that Zia's propagation of a new brand of
  Bangladeshi nationalism was a scheme &quot;to simultaneously consolidate
  feelings of nationhood, provide a series of symbols for unifying the country,
  contribute to the enthusiasm with which nation-building activities are
  pursued, and, ultimately maintain the identity and integrity of Bangladesh as
  a nation-state independent of India.&quot; (49) In a posthumously published
  article written by Zia, he lists seven factors which he considers to be the
  bases of Bangladeshi nationalism: territory, people irrespective of religion,
  Bengali language, culture, economic life, religion, and the legacy of the 1971
  liberation war. (50) There is an obvious contradiction between &quot;people
  irrespective of religion&quot; and &quot;religion,&quot; and that has since
  then been the dilemma for Bangladesh's non-Muslim population. Ershad's
  declaration of Islam as the state religion made it clear that
  &quot;religion&quot; in a Bangladeshi context means Islam.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="banalee_taliban8.jpg" width="450" height="295"></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><br>
  Bangladesh's Islamic identity has strengthened over the years, and after the
  October 2001 election there has been a marked increase in the number of
  attacks on non-Muslim population groups. These attacks appear to have been
  prompted by a desire to build a real &quot;nation state,&quot; free from
  minorities, as well as motivated by political revenge. <i>Amnesty
  International</i> reported in December 2001: &quot;Hindus in Bangladesh have
  tended to vote for the Awami League. They have therefore been the target of a
  political backlash by supporters of parties opposing Awami League.&quot; In
  Ziodhara, one of the worst affected villages, several hundred Hindu villagers
  left the area. In another village, Deuatala Bazar, gangs of young men wielding
  sharp weapons reportedly went from door to door telling Hindus to &quot;go
  away.&quot; (51) In Chandaikona Bazar another youth gang damaged Hindu statues
  and looted the temple. (52)<br>
  <br>
  The Amnesty report continues: &quot;Human rights organizations in Bangladesh
  believe over 100 women have been subjected to rape. Reports persistently
  allege that the perpetrators have been manly members of the BNP and its
  coalition partner Jamaat-e-Islami.&quot; (53) As a result, thousands of
  Bangladeshi Hindus have fled to India, often leaving their belongings and land
  behind. The exact number of refugees is uncertain, as they tend to blend in
  with the largely Hindu population of the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam
  and Tripura.<br>
  <br>
  Other religious minorities have also been targeted. In December 2001, a
  Bangladeshi newspaper reported that young women from 50 Christian families in
  Natore were living in fear of hoodlums who would roar past their huts on
  motorcycles at night. The hoodlums demanded ransom of 10,000-20,000
  Bangladeshi taka ($175-350) from men in the village - or their daughters. The
  villagers had also had their crops taken away after the October election. (54)
  In April 2002 a well-known Buddhist monk, Ganojyoti Mohasthobir, was murdered
  by a group of thugs who demanded he paid them &quot;infidel protection
  tax.&quot; (55)<br>
  <br>
  But also moderate Muslims have become victims. On November 22, 2001 prominent
  journalist and writer Shahriar Kabir, was arrested at Dhaka international
  airport on his return from Kolkata. He had been to India to cover the plight
  of the Hindus who had fled persecution in Bangladesh, and had his video tapes,
  film and camera confiscated by the police at the airport. He was held in
  custody for 19 days before he was released on bail. In March 2002, two staff
  members of the NGO Proshika (&quot;a Center for Human Development&quot;), Omar
  Tarek Chawdhury and Ajhar-ul Hoque, were arrested on allegations that they had
  been in possession of &quot;documents&quot; relating to attacks against
  Hindus. (56)<br>
  <br>
  Their arrest came only weeks after the Danish and German ambassadors in Dhaka
  had asked the Bangladesh government to &quot;take immediate steps to stop all
  sorts of repression and attacks on the country's religious and other
  minorities.&quot; (57) But there are no signs that this is about to happen. On
  the contrary, the future for the country's religious and ethnic minorities
  appears bleak as &quot;Bangladeshi nationalism&quot; is becoming synonymous
  with a stronger Muslim identity - and Islamic groups are becoming increasingly
  fierce in their public statements and actions.<br>
