  <p>Conclusion</b><br>
  <br>
  <font color="#ff0000" size="6"><b>I</b></font>n December 2001, Maulana Ubaidul
  Haq, the khatib (cleric) of Bangladesh's national mosque, Baitul Mukarram, and
  a Jamaat associate, publicly condemned the US war on terror and urged
  followers to wage a holy war against the USA. &quot;President Bush and America
  is the most heinous terrorist in the world. Both America and Bush must be
  destroyed. The Americans will be washed away if Bangladesh's 120 million
  Muslims spit on them,&quot; the cleric told a gathering of hundreds of
  thousands of Bangladeshi Muslims which included several high-ranking officials
  in the new government that took over in October 2001. (58)<br>
  <br>
  <font color="#000080">Despite the virulent rhetoric, it is highly unlikely
  that Bangladesh's 120 million Muslims would spit on the Americans, or wage a
  holy war against anybody. Bangladesh’s secular roots are holding, at least
  for the time being. But the country's Islamic extremists are becoming more
  vocal and daring in their attacks on &quot;infidels,&quot; a worrying sign in
  what is basically a very tolerant society. And it is not the number of
  extremists that matters - even a small group can spread fear and terror - but
  how well-organized and dedicated they are.</font><br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh's Islamic extremists are becoming better organized, as the May
  meeting at Ukhia of nine militant groups shows. The proliferation of small
  arms, and an ensuing increase in violence of all kinds especially in that part
  of the country, is also a growing concern. It prompted the country's donors,
  which met in Paris in March 2002, to tag aid to an improvement in the law and
  order situation.</p>
  <p>In mid-2001,the estimated number of illegal arms in Bangladesh was 250,000
  of which only 5,481 were recovered during a crackdown in the lead-up to the
  general election in October 2001. (59) In early 2002, three leading local
  human rights groups in Bangladesh reported that a total of 258 people were
  murdered in March alone of which 39 were political killings. In the month of
  February, the number of murders was 336, including a journalist, according to
  Bangladeshi NGO the Institute of Democratic Watch. (60)<br>
  <br>
  A culture of violence, especially among the young, is emerging, and many young
  Islamic militants now are armed. The role of the madrassas in shaping the next
  generation of Bangladeshis also cannot be underestimated. By including the
  Jamaat in her cabinet, Khaleda Zia is playing with fire.</p>
  <font color="#000080">
  <p>On the other hand, Bangladesh remains heavily dependent on foreign aid, and
  cannot afford to antagonize its most important donor countries, mainly Japan
  and the West. It should, therefore, be in the government's interest to contain
  the spread of Islamic extremism.</p>
  </font>
  <p>But so far, very little has been done to counter the propaganda and
  activities of the extremists, and Khaleda Zia has publicly - and angrily -
  stated in response to the inclusion of two Jamaat ministers in her cabinet
  that &quot;there are no talibans in my government.&quot; (61) By contrast,
  even in the streets of Dhaka, activists of the Jamaat, ICS and HUJI used to
  proudly identify themselves as &quot;Bangladeshi talibans,&quot; although they
  stopped using that label, at least in public, following the September 11,
  2001, attacks in New York and Washington.<br>
  <br>
  Some Western diplomats in Dhaka also tend to downplay the extremist threat,
  viewing local militant Islamic movements as rather insignificant fringe
  groups. During a breakfast meeting in May 2002 in Washington sponsored by the
  US Bangladesh Advisory Council, Mary Ann Peters, the ambassador of the United
  States to Bangladesh, rejected reports of a growing extremist threat.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>She termed a report in the April 2, 2002, issue of the Wall Street Journal
  as &quot;an example of lack of understanding on the part of journalists
  covering the country's political and social structure.&quot; She went on to
  criticize a similar story in the April 4, 2002, issue of the Far Eastern
  Economic Review, and called the reporter &quot;lazy&quot; for not working hard</b>
  <b>enough on the subject and for his failure to give any &quot;clue&quot; in
  the article that might help make further investigations.</b> She also asserted
  that media reports about violence against the Hindu community were
  &quot;exaggerations of facts on the ground.&quot; The US embassy in Dhaka had
  sent its officers to verify the media reports, and that in all cases it was
  found that the actual situation was less worrisome than what they appeared to
  be, she said. (62)<br>
  <br>
  It is uncertain whether the US ambassador's statements were motivated by a
  desire to be overly diplomatic, or if they were based on poor intelligence.
  But such denials will only exacerbate what undoubtedly is a growing problem.
  It is also important to emphasize that the rise of religious extremism and
  intolerance in Bangladesh is not just a side effect of military politics.</p>
  <p>According to Enayetullah Khan, editor of the Bangladesh weekly<i> Holiday</i>,
  the issue reflects the struggle of a young and fragile nation to find a
  national identity: &quot;We're having a bit of an identity crisis here. Are we
  Bengalis first and Muslims second, or Muslims first and Bengalis second? This
  is the problem. And when Muslim identity becomes an Islamic identity we're in
  real trouble.&quot; (63)<br>
  <br>
  As Indonesia - another country that until recently was considered a moderate
  Muslim state - has shown, an economic collapse or political crisis can give
  rise to militants for whom religious fanaticism equals national pride; and a
  way out of misrule, disorder and corrupt worldly politics. ( <font color="#ff0000"><b>Concluded</b></font>

  <p>[The End]</b><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Appendix: Main Islamic groups in Bangladesh<br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Jamaat-e-Islami</b>. A political party that dates back to the British
  colonial era, and the (East) Pakistan period (1947-1971). It supported
  Pakistan against the Bengali nationalists during the liberation war, and most
  of its leaders fled to (West) Pakistan after Bangladesh's independence in
  1971. Its then amir, or leader, Gholam Azam, fought against the freedom
  fighters in 1971, but returned to Bangladesh a few years later. In December
  2000, Motiur Rahman Nizami, another former pro-Pakistani militant, took over
  as amir of the Jamaat. In the October 2001 election, the Jamaat emerged as the
  third largest party with 17 seats in the parliament and two ministers in the
  new coalition government. The Jamaat's final aim is an Islamic state in
  Bangladesh, although this will be implemented step by step.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS</b>). Jamaat's youth organisation. Set up in
  1941, it became a member of the International Islamic Federation of Student
  Organisations in 1979. ICS is also a member of the World Assembly of Muslim
  Youth and has close contacts with other radical Muslim youth groups in
  Pakistan, the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. One of its main strongholds
  in Bangladesh is at the university in Chittagong, and it dominates
  privately-run madrassas all over the country. It has been involved in a number
  of bomb blasts and politically and religiously motivated assassinations. Nurul
  Islam Bulbul is its current president and Muhammed Nazrul Islam is the
  secretary general.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Islami Oikyo Jote (IOJ)</b>. A smaller Islamic party that last year joined
  the 4-party alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which won
  the October 2001 election. The IOJ secured two seats in the parliament, but<br>
  did not get any cabinet posts. The fourth member of the alliance, a faction of
  the Jatyio Party led by Naziur Rahman Manzur, has no obvious Islamic profile.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HUJI)</b>. Bangladesh's main militant outfit.
  Set up in 1992, it now has an estimated strength of 15,000 and is headed by
  Shawkat Osman aka Maulana or Sheikh Farid in Chittagong. Its members are
  recruited mainly from students of the country's many madrassas, and until last
  year they called themselves &quot;Bangladeshi Taliban.&quot; The group is
  believed to have extensive contacts with Muslim organizations in the Indian
  states of West Bengal and Assam.<br>
  <br>
  <b>&quot;The Jihad Movement&quot;</b>. Osama bin Laden's February 23, 1998,
  fatwah urging Jihad against the United States was co-signed by two Egyptian
  clerics, one from Pakistan, and Fazlul Rahman, &quot;leader of the Jihad
  Movement in Bangladesh.&quot; This is not believed to be a separate
  organisation but a common name for several Islamic groups in Bangladesh, of
  which HUJI is considered the biggest and most important.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Arakan Rohingya National Organisation (ARNO)</b>. A political group among
  Rohingyas migrants from Burma, who live in the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar area,
  and claim to be fighting for an autonomous Muslim region in Burma's Arakan (Rakhine)
  State. It was set up in 1998 through a merger of the Arakan Rohingya Islamic
  Front (ARIF) and the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO). Within months,
  however, the front fell apart. The leader of what<br>
  remains of ARNO, Nurul Islam, is considered a moderate. He also led the ARIF
  before the merger in 1998.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO)</b>. Following the breakup of ARNO
  in 1999-2000, three new factions emerged, all of them re-claiming the old name
  RSO. Traditionally, the RSO has been very close to Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami
  Chhatra Shibir in Chittagong and Cox's Bazaar. In the early 1990s, RSO had
  several military camps near the Burmese border, where cadres from the Islami
  Chhatra Shibir were also trained in guerrilla warfare.<br>
