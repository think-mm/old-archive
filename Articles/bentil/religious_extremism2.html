  <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="4"><font size="2">
  <p><font face="Arial">It is impossible to determine how much support the
  Jamaat actually had in the 2001 election as it was part of an alliance whose
  various members voted for each other against the Awami League, but its 17
  seats in the new parliament - and two ministers in the government - suggest a
  dramatic increase. Its youth organization, Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS), is
  especially active. It is a member of the International Islamic Federation of
  Student Organizations as well as the World Assembly of Muslim Youth and has
  close contacts with other radical Muslim groups in Pakistan, the Middle East,
  Malaysia and Indonesia.&nbsp; One of its main strongholds is at the university
  in Chittagong, and it dominates the Deobandi madrassas all over the country,
  from where it draws most of its new members. It has been implicated in a
  number of bombings and politically and religiously motivated assassinations.<br>
  <br>
  On April 7, 2001, two leaders of the Awami League's youth and student front
  were killed by ICS activists and on June 15, an estimated 21 people were
  killed and over 100 injured in a bomb blast at the Awami League party office
  in the town of Narayanganj.&nbsp; Two weeks later, the police arrested an ICS
  activist for his alleged involvement in the blast. (18)&nbsp; A youngish
  Islamic militant, Nurul Islam Bulbul, is the ICS's current president, and
  Muhammad Nazrul Islam its general secretary.<br>
  <br>
  For many years the mother party, the Jamaat, was led by Gholam Azam, who had
  returned from Pakistan when Zia was still alive and in power. He resigned in
  December 2000, and Motiur Rahman Nizami took over as the new amir of the party
  amid wide protests and demands that he be put on trial for war crimes he
  committed during the liberation war as the head of a notorious paramilitary
  force, the Al-Badar. In one particular incident on December 3, 1971, some
  members of that force seized the village of Bishalikkha at night in search of
  freedom fighters, beating many and killing eight people. When Nizami's
  appointment was made public, veterans of the liberation war burnt an effigy of
  him during a public rally. (19) In October 2001, Nizami was appointed minister
  for agriculture, an important post in a mainly agricultural country such as
  Bangladesh. His deputy, Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid, became minister for social
  welfare.<br>
  <br>
  The terrorist attacks in New York on September 11, 2001, occurred during the
  election campaign in Bangladesh, when the country was ruled by a caretaker
  government. But the outgoing prime minister, the Awami League's Sheikh Hasina,
  and then opposition leader Khaleda Zia of the BNP, condemned the attacks and
  both, if they were elected, offered the United States use of Bangladesh's air
  space, ports and other facilities to launch military attacks against the
  Taliban and Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Many Bangladeshis were moved by the loss
  of as many as 50 of their countrymen in the attacks on the World Trade Center.
  While some of them were immigrants working as computer analysts and engineers,
  most seem to have been waiters at the Window on the World restaurant who were
  working hard to send money back to poor relatives in Bangladesh.&nbsp; A
  Bangladeshi embassy official in Washington branded the attacks &quot;an
  affront to Islam , an attack on humanity.&quot; (20)<br>
  <br>
  Jamaat's stand on the &quot;war against terrorism,&quot; however, contrasts
  sharply to that of the more established parties. Shortly after the US attacks
  on Afghanistan began in October 2001, the Jamaat created a fund purportedly
  for &quot;helping the innocent victims of America's war.&quot; According to
  the Jamaat's own announcements, 12 million Bangladeshi taka ($210,000) was
  raised before the effort was discontinued in March 2002. Any remaining funds,
  the Jamaat then said, would go to Afghan refugees in camps in Pakistan. (21)<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </font></font><b><font face="Arial" size="3">2. The Rise of the
  Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HUJI) and other Extremist Groups<br>
  </font></b><font size="2"><br>
  <font face="Arial">The growth of the Jamaat during the Ershad regime paved the
  way for the establishment of even more radical groups when the BNP returned to
  power in 1991. According to Bangladeshi journalists, in the early 1990s
  Bangladeshi diplomats in Saudi-Arabia issued passports to Pakistani militants
  in the kingdom to enable them to escape to Bangladesh. (22) Other extremists
  from Pakistan - and perhaps also Afghanistan - appear to have been able to
  enter Bangladesh in the same way during that period.<br>
  <br>
  These men were instrumental in building up HUJI, which was first formed in
  1992, reportedly with funds from Osama bin Laden. (23) The existence of firm
  links between the new Bangladeshi militants and Al-Qaeda was proven when
  Fazlul Rahman, leader of the &quot;Jihad Movement in Bangladesh&quot; (to
  which HUJI belongs), signed the official declaration of &quot;holy war&quot;
  against the United States on February 23, 1998. Other signatories included bin
  Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri (leader of the Jihad Group in Egypt), Rifa'i Ahmad
  Taha aka Abu-Yasir (Egyptian Islamic Group), and Sheikh Mir Hamzah (secretary
  of the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Pakistan). (24)<br>
  </font></font></p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="banalee_taliban5.jpg" width="450" height="341"></p>
  <p>
  <font face="Arial">
  <br>
  HUJI is headed by Shawkat Osman aka Maulana or Sheikh Farid in Chittagong and,
  according to the US State Department, has &quot;at least six camps&quot; in
  Bangladesh. (25) Like the ICS it draws most of its members from the country's
  Deobandi madrassas, and, also like the ICS, the group has shown that it is
  capable of extreme violence. Bangladesh's Islamic radicals first came to
  international attention in 1993, when author Taslima Nasrin was forced to flee
  the country after receiving death threats. The fundamentalists objected to her
  critical writings about what she termed outdated religious beliefs. Extremist
  groups offered a $5,000 reward for her death. She now lives in exile in
  France.<br>
  <br>
  While Nasrin's outspoken, feminist writings caused controversy even among
  moderate Bangladeshi Muslims, the entire state was shocked when, in early
  1999, three men attempted to kill Shams ur-Rahman, a well-known poet and a
  symbol of Bangladesh's secular nationhood. During the ensuing arrests, the
  police said they seized a list of several intellectuals and writers, including
  Nasrin, whom Bangladeshi religious extremists branded &quot;enemies of
  Islam.&quot; (26)<br>
  <br>
  Bangladeshi human rights organizations openly accuse HUJI of being behind both
  the death threats against Nasrin and the attempt to kill Rahman. The US State
  Department notes that HUJI has been accused of stabbing a senior Bangladeshi
  journalist in November 2000 for making a documentary on the plight of Hindus
  in Bangladesh, and the July 2000 assassination attempt of then prime minister
  Sheikh Hasina. (27)

  <font face="Arial">
  As with the Jamaat and the ICS, HUJI's main stronghold is in the lawless
  southeast, which includes the border with Burma. With its fluid population and
  weak law enforcement, the region has long been a haven for smugglers, gun
  runners, pirates, and ethnic insurgents from across the Burmese border. The
  past decade has seen a massive influx of weapons, especially small arms,
  through the fishing port of Cox's Bazar, which has made the situation in the
  southeast even more dangerous and volatile. (28)<br>
  <br>
  Typically, the winner in the 2001 election in one of the constituencies in
  Cox's Bazaar, BNP candidate Shahjahan Chowdhury, was said to be supported by
  &quot;the man allegedly leading smuggling operations in [the border town of]
  Teknaf.&quot; Instead of the regular army, the paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles
  was deployed in this constituency to help the police in their electoral
  peacekeeping. This was, according to the NGO SEHD, &quot;criticised by the
  local people who alleged that the Bangladesh Rifles were well connected with
  the smuggling activities and thus could take partisan roles.&quot; (29)<br>
  <br>
  In one of the most recent high-profile attacks in the area, Gopal Krishna
  Muhuri, the 60-year-old principal of Nazirhat College in Chittagong and a
  leading secular humanist, was gunned down in November 2001 in his home by four
  hired assassins, who belonged to a gang patronized by the Jamaat. (30) India,
  which is viewing the growth of Bangladesh's Islamic movements with deep
  concern, has linked HUJI militants to the attack on the American Center in
  Kolkata (Calcutta) in January 2002, and a series of bomb blasts in the state
  of Assam in mid-1999. (31)<br>
  <br>
  On May 10-11, 2002, nine Islamic fundamentalist groups, including HUJI, met at
  a camp near the small town of Ukhia south of Cox's Bazaar and formed the
  Bangladesh Islamic Manch (Association). The new umbrella organization also
  includes one purporting to represent the Rohingyas, a Muslim minority in
  Burma, and the Muslim Liberation Tigers of Assam, a small group operating in
  India's northeast. By June, Bangladeshi veterans of the anti-Soviet war in
  Afghanistan in the 1980s were reported to be training members of the new
  alliance in at least two camps in southern Bangladesh. (32)<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </font><b><font face="Arial" size="3">3. The Plight of the Rohingyas<br>
  </font></b><font size="2"><br>
  <font face="Arial">The Arakan area of Burma was separated from the rest of the
  country by a densely forested mountain range, which made it possible for the
  Arakanese - most of whom are Buddhist - to maintain their independence until
  the late 18th century. Contacts with the outside world had until then been
  mostly to the west, which, in turn, had brought Islam to the region. The first
  Muslims on the Arakan coast were Moorish, Arab and Persian traders who arrived
  between the 9th and the 15th centuries. Some of them stayed and married local
  women. Their offspring became the forefathers of yet another hybrid race,
  which much later was to become known as the Rohingyas. Like the people in the
  Chittagong area, they speak a Bengali dialect interspersed with words borrowed
  from Persian, Urdu and Arakanese. (33)<br>
  <br>
  There is no evidence of friction between them and their Buddhist neighbors in
  the earlier days. Indeed, after 1430 the Arakanese kings, though Buddhists,
  even used Muslim titles in addition to their own names and issued medallions
  bearing the kalima, or Muslim confession of faith. (34) Persian was the court
  language until the Burmese invasion in 1784. Burmese rule lasted until the
  first Anglo-Burmese war of 1824-26, when Arakan was taken over by the British
  along with the Tenasserim region of southeastern Burma.<br>
  <br>
  When Burma was a part of British India, the rich ricelands of Arakan attracted
  thousands of seasonal laborers, especially from the Chittagong area of
  adjacent East Bengal. Many of them found it convenient to stay since there was
  already a large Muslim population who spoke the same language, and, at that
  time, no ill feeling towards immigrants from India proper - unlike the
  situation in other parts of Burma, where people of subcontinental origin were
  despised. At the same time, Buddhist Arakanese migrated to East Bengal and
  settled along the coast between Chittagong and Cox's Bazaar. The official
  border, the Naf River, united rather than separated the two British
  territories.<br>
  <br>
  But the presence of a Muslim minority in Arakan became an issue after Burma's
  independence in 1948. The Buddhist and Muslim communities had become divided
  during World War Two; the Buddhists had rallied behind the Japanese while the
  Muslims had remained loyal to the British. Some Muslims, fearing reprisals
  from the Buddhists once the British were gone, rose up in arms, demanding an
  independent state, and the Burmese army was sent in to quell the rebellion.
  Predominantly Buddhist Burma never really recognized the Arakanese Muslims -
  who in the 1960s began to refer to themselves as &quot;Rohingya,&quot; a term
  of disputed origin - as one of the country's &quot;indigenous&quot; ethnic
  groups. As such, and because of their different religion and physical
  appearance, they have often become convenient scapegoats for Burma's military
  government to rally the public against whenever that country has been hit by
  an economic or political crisis.<br>
  <br>
  In March 1978, the Burmese government launched a campaign code-named Naga Min
  (Dragon King) in Arakan, ostensibly to &quot;check illegal immigrants.&quot;
  Hundreds of heavily armed troops raided Muslim neighborhoods in Sittwe (Akyab)
  and some 5,000 people were arrested. As the operation was extended to other
  parts of Arakan, tens of thousands of Rohingyas crossed the border to
  Bangladesh. By the end of June, an approximately 200,000 Rohingyas had fled,
  causing an international outcry. (35) Eventually, most of the refugees were
  allowed to return, but thousands found it safer to remain on the Bangladesh
  side of the border. Entire communities of &quot;illegal immigrants&quot; from
  Burma sprung up along the border south of Cox's Bazaar, and a steady trickle
  of refugees from Burma continued to cross into Bangladesh throughout the
  1980s.<br>
  <br>
  The immensely wealthy Saudi-Arabian charity Rabitat al Alam al Islami began
  sending aid to the Rohingya refugees during the 1978 crisis, and it also built
  a hospital and a madrassa at Ukhia south of Cox's Bazaar. Prior to these
  events, there was only one political organization among the Rohingyas on the
  Bangladesh-Burma border, the Rohingya Patriotic Front (RPF), which was set up
  in 1974 by Muhammad Jafar Habib, a native of Buthidaung in Arakan and a
  graduate of Rangoon University. He made several appeals - most of them
  unsuccessful - to the international Islamic community for help, and maintained
  a camp for his small guerrilla army, which operated from the Bangladeshi side
  of the border.<br>
  <br>
  In the early 1980s, more radical elements among the Rohingyas broke away from
  the RPF to set up the Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO). Led by a medical
  doctor from Arakan, Muhammad Yunus, it soon became the main and most militant
  faction among the Rohingyas in Bangladesh and on the border. Given its more
  rigid religious stand, the RSO soon enjoyed support from like-minded groups in
  the Muslim world. These included Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh and Pakistan,
  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami in Afghanistan, Hizbe-ul Mujahideen in
  Kashmir and Angkatan Belia Islam sa-Malaysia (ABIM), the Islamic Youth
  Organization of Malaysia. Afghan instructors were seen in some of the RSO
  camps along the Bangladesh-Burma border, while nearly 100 RSO rebels were
  reported to be undergoing training in the Afghan province of Khost with
  Hizb-e-Islami Mujahideen. (36)<br>
