    <p align="justify"><font class="subsectionhead" color="red" size="3">The
    Vedas as books of science</font>
    <p align="justify">IN 1996, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) of the United
    Kingdom (U.K.) produced a slick looking book, with many well-produced
    pictures of colourfully dressed men and women performing Hindu ceremonies,
    accompanied with warm, fuzzy and completely sanitised description of the
    faith. The book, <i>Explaining Hindu Dharma: A Guide for Teachers</i>,
    offers &quot;teaching suggestions for introducing Hindu ideas and topics in
    the classroom&quot; at the middle to high school level in the British
    schools system. The authors and editors are all card-carrying members of the
    VHP. The book is now in its second edition and, going by the glowing reviews
    on the back-cover, it seems to have established itself as a much-used
    educational resource in the British school system.
    <p align="justify">What &quot;teaching suggestions&quot; does this <i>Guide</i>
    offer? It advises British teachers to introduce Hindu dharma as &quot;just
    another name&quot; for &quot;eternal laws of nature&quot; first discovered
    by Vedic seers, and subsequently confirmed by modern physics and biological
    sciences. After giving a false but incredibly smug account of mathematics,
    physics, astronomy, medicine and evolutionary theory contained in the Vedic
    texts, the <i>Guide</i> instructs the teachers to present the Vedic
    scriptures as &quot;not just old religious books, but as books which contain
    many true scientific facts... these <i>ancient scriptures of the Hindus can
    be treated as scientific texts</i>&quot; (emphasis added). All that modern
    science teaches us about the workings of nature can be found in the Vedas,
    and all that the Vedas teach about the nature of matter, god, and human
    beings is affirmed by modern science. There is no conflict, there are no
    contradictions. Modern science and the Vedas are simply &quot;different
    names for the same truth&quot;.
    <p align="justify">This is the image of Hinduism that the VHP and other
    Hindutva propagandists want to project around the world. The British case is
    not an isolated example. Similar initiatives to portray Vedic-Aryan India as
    the &quot;cradle&quot; of world civilisation and science have been launched
    in Canada and the United States as well. Many of these initiatives are
    beneficiaries of the generous and politically correct policies of
    multicultural education in these countries. Under the worthy cause of
    presenting the &quot;community's&quot; own views about its culture, many
    Western governments are inadvertently funding Hindutva's propaganda.

    a decade ago.</b></center>
    <p>&nbsp;
    <p align="justify">But what concerns us in this article is not the
    long-distance Hindutva (or &quot;Yankee Hindutva&quot;, as some call it),
    dangerous though it is. This essay is more about the left wing-counterpart
    of Yankee Hindutva: a set of postmodernist ideas, mostly (but not entirely)
    exported from the West, which unintentionally ends up supporting Hindutva's
    propaganda regarding Vedic science. Over the last couple of decades, a set
    of very fashionable, supposedly &quot;radical&quot; critiques of modern
    science have dominated the Western universities. These critical theories of
    science go under the label of &quot;postmodernism&quot; or &quot;social
    constructivism&quot;. These theories see modern science as an essentially
    Western, masculine and imperialistic way of acquiring knowledge.
    Intellectuals of Indian origin, many of them living and working in the West,
    have played a lead role in development of postmodernist critiques of modern
    science as a source of colonial &quot;violence&quot; against non-Western
    ways of knowing.
    <p align="justify">In this two-part essay, I will examine how this
    postmodernist left has provided philosophical arguments for Hindutva's claim
    that Vedas are &quot;just another name&quot; for modern science. As we will
    see, postmodernist attacks on objective and universal knowledge have played
    straight into Hindu nationalist slogan of all perspectives being equally
    true - within their own context and at their own level. The result is the
    loud - but false - claims of finding a tradition of empirical science in the
    spiritual teachings of the Vedas and Vedanta. Such scientisation of the
    Vedas does nothing to actually promote an empirical and rational tradition
    in India, while it does an incalculable harm to the spiritual message of
    Hinduism's sacred books. The mixing up of the <i>mythos</i> of the Vedas
    with the <i>logos</i> of science must be of great concern not just to the
    scientific community, but also to the religious people, for it is a
    distortion of both science and spirituality.
    <p align="justify">In order to understand how postmodern critiques of
    science converge with Hindutva's celebration of Vedas-as-science, let us
    follow the logic behind VHP's <i>Guide for Teachers</i>.
    <p align="justify">This <i>Guide</i> claims that the ancient Hindu
    scriptures contain &quot;many true scientific facts&quot; and therefore
    &quot;can be treated as scientific texts&quot;. Let us see what these
    &quot;true scientific facts&quot; are. The prime exhibit is the
    &quot;scientific affirmation&quot; of the theory of <i>guna</i> (Sanskrit
    for qualities or attributes). Following the essential Vedantic idea that
    matter and spirit are not separate and distinct entities, but rather the
    spiritual principle constitutes the very fabric of the material world, the
    theory of <i>guna</i>s teaches that matter exhibits spiritual/moral
    qualities. There are three such qualities or <i>guna</i>s which are shared
    by all matter, living or non-living: the quality or <i>guna</i> of purity
    and calmness seeking higher knowledge (<i>sattvic</i>), the quality or <i>guna</i>
    of impurity, darkness, ignorance and inactivity (<i>tamsic</i>) and the
    quality or <i>guna</i> of activity, curiosity, worldly gain (<i>rajasic</i>).
    Modern atomic physics, the VHP's <i>Guide</i> claims, has confirmed the
    presence of these qualities in nature. The evidence? Physics shows that
    there are three atomic particles bearing positive, negative and neutral
    charges, which correspond to the three <i>guna</i>s! From this
    &quot;scientific proof&quot; of the existence of essentially spiritual/moral
    <i>guna</i>s in atoms, the <i>Guide</i> goes on to triumphantly deduce the
    &quot;scientific&quot; confirmation of the truths of all those Vedic
    sciences which use the concept of <i>guna</i>s (for example, Ayurveda).
    Having &quot;demonstrated&quot; the scientific credentials of Hinduism, the <i>Guide</i>
    boldly advises British school teachers to instruct their students that there
    is &quot;no conflict&quot; between the eternal laws of <i>dharma</i> and the
    laws discovered by modern science.

    <b>In Kolkata, astrologers demonstrating against the West Bengal
    government's decision not to introduce astrology as a subject in the State's
    universities. A file picture.</b></center>
    <p>&nbsp;
    <p align="justify">One of the most ludicrous <i>mantra</i>s of Hindutva
    propaganda is that there is &quot;no conflict&quot; between modern science
    and Hinduism. In reality, everything we know about the workings of nature
    through the methods of modern science radically <i>disconfirms</i> the
    presence of any morally significant <i>guna</i>s, or <i>shakti</i>, or any
    other form of consciousness in nature, as taught by the Vedic cosmology
    which treats nature as a manifestation of divine consciousness. Far from
    there being &quot;no conflict&quot; between science and Hinduism, <i>a
    scientific understanding of nature completely and radically negates the
    &quot;eternal laws&quot; of Hindu dharma which teach an identity between
    spirit and matter</i>. That is precisely why the Hindutva apologists are so
    keen to tame modern science by reducing it to &quot;simply another name for
    the One Truth&quot; - the &quot;one truth&quot; of Absolute Consciousness
    contained in Hinduism's own classical texts.
    <p align="justify">If Hindu propagandists can go this far in U.K., imagine
    their power in India, where they control the Central government and its
    agencies for media, education and research. This obsession for finding all
    kinds of science in all kinds of obscure Hindu doctrines has been dictating
    the official educational policy of the Bharatiya Janata Party ever since it
    came to power nearly half a decade ago.
    <p align="justify">Indeed the BJP government can teach a thing or two to the
    creation scientists in the U.S. Creationists, old and new, are trying to
    smuggle in Christian dogma into secular schools in the U.S. by redefining
    science in a way that allows God to be brought in as a cause of natural
    phenomena. This &quot;theistic science&quot; is meant to serve as the
    thin-edge of the wedge that will pry open the secular establishment. Unlike
    the creationists who have to contend with the courts and the legislatures in
    the U.S., the Indian government itself wields the wedge of Vedic science
    intended to dismantle the (admittedly half-hearted) secularist education
    policies. By teaching Vedic Hinduism as &quot;science&quot;, the Indian
    state and elites can portray India as &quot;secular&quot; and
    &quot;modern&quot;, a model of sobriety and responsibility in contrast with
    those obscurantist Islamic fundamentalists across the border who insist on
    keeping science out of their <i>madrassa</i>s. How useful is this
    appellation of &quot;science&quot;, for it dresses up so much religious
    indoctrination as &quot;secular education&quot;.
    <p align="justify">Under the kindly patronage of the state, Hindutva's wedge
    strategy is working wonders. Astrology is flourishing as an academic subject
    in public and private colleges and universities, and is being put to use in
    predicting future earthquakes and other natural disasters. Such
    &quot;sciences&quot; as <i>Vastu Shastra</i> and Vedic mathematics are
    attracting governmental grants for research and education. While the
    Ministry of Defence is sponsoring research and development of weapons and
    devices with magical powers mentioned in the ancient epics, the Health
    Ministry is investing in research, development and sale of cow urine, sold
    as a cure for all ailments from the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
    (AIDS) to tuberculosis (TB). Faith-healing and priest-craft are other
    &quot;sciences&quot; receiving public and private funding. In the rest of
    the culture, miracles and superstitions of all kinds have the blessings of
    influential public figures, including elected Members of Parliament.
    <p align="justify">THERE are two kinds of claims that feed the notion that
    the &quot;Vedas are books of science&quot;. The first kind declared the
    entire Vedic corpus as converging with modern science, while the second
    concentrates on defending such esoteric practices as astrology, <i>vastu</i>,
    Ayurveda, transcendental meditation and so on as scientific within the Vedic
    paradigm. The first stream seeks to establish likeness, connections and
    convergences between radically opposed ideas (<i>guna</i> theory and atomic
    particles, for example). This stream does not relativise science: it simply
    grabs whatever theory of physics or biology may be popular with Western
    scientists at any given time, and claims that Hindu ideas are &quot;like
    that&quot;, or &quot;mean the same&quot; and &quot;therefore&quot; are
    perfectly modern and rational. The second stream is far more radical, as it
    defends this &quot;method&quot; of drawing likenesses and correspondences
    between unlike entities as perfectly rational and &quot;scientific&quot;
    within the non-dualistic Vedic worldview. The second stream, in other words,
    relativises scientific method to dominant religious worldviews: it holds
    that the Hindu style of thinking by analogies and correspondences
    &quot;directly revealed to the mind's eye&quot; is as scientific within the
    &quot;holistic&quot; worldview of Vedic Hinduism, as the analytical and
    experimental methodology of modern science is to the &quot;reductionist&quot;
    worldview of Semitic religions. The relativist defence of eclecticism as a
    legitimate scientific method not only provides a cover for the first stream,
    it also provides a generic defence of such emerging &quot;alternative
    sciences&quot; as &quot;Vedic physics&quot; and &quot;Vedic
    creationism&quot;, as well as defending such pseudo-sciences as Vedic
    astrology, palmistry, TM (transcendental meditation) and new-age Ayurveda
    (Deepak Chopra style).
    <p align="justify">In what follows, I will examine how postmodernist and
    social constructivist critiques of science have lent support to both streams
    of Vedas-as-science literature.
    <p align="justify">But first, I must clarify what I mean by postmodernism.
    <p align="justify">Postmodernism is a mood, a disposition. The chief
    characteristic of the postmodernist disposition is that it is opposed to the
    Enlightenment, which is taken to be the core of modernism. Of course, there
    is no simple characterisation of the Enlightenment any more than there is of
    postmodernism. A rough and ready portrayal might go like this: Enlightenment
    is a general attitude fostered in the 17th and 18th centuries on the heels
    of the Scientific Revolution; it aims to replace superstition and authority
    of traditions and established religions with critical reason represented,
    above all, by the growth of modern science. The Enlightenment project was
    based upon a hope that improvement in secular scientific knowledge will lead
    to an improvement of the human condition, not just materially but also
    ethically and culturally. While the Enlightenment spirit flourished
    primarily in Europe and North America, intellectual movements in India,
    China, Japan, Latin America, Egypt and other parts of West Asia were also
    influenced by it. However, the combined weight of colonialism and cultural
    nationalism thwarted the Enlightenment spirit in non-Western societies.
    <p align="justify">Postmodernists are disillusioned with this triumphalist
    view of science dispelling ignorance and making the world a better place.
    Their despair leads them to question the possibility of progress toward some
    universal truth that everyone, everywhere must accept. Against the
    Enlightenment's faith in such universal &quot;meta-narratives&quot;
    advancing to truth, postmodernists prefer local traditions which are not
    entirely led by rational and instrumental criteria but make room for the
    sacred, the non-instrumental and even the irrational. Social constructivist
    theories of science nicely complement postmodernists' angst against science.
    There are many schools of social constructivism, including the &quot;strong
    programme&quot; of the Edinburgh (Scotland) school, and the &quot;actor
    network&quot; programme associated with a school in Paris, France. The many
    convoluted and abstruse arguments of these programmes do not concern us
    here. Basically, these programmes assert that modern science, which we take
    to be moving closer to objective truth about nature, is actually just one
    culture-bound way to look at nature: no better or worse than all other
    sciences of other cultures. Not just the agenda, but the content of all
    knowledge is socially constructed: the supposed &quot;facts&quot; of modern
    science are &quot;Western&quot; constructions, reflecting dominant interests
    and cultural biases of Western societies.
    <p align="justify">Following this logic, Indian critics of science,
    especially those led by the neo-Gandhians such as Ashis Nandy and Vandana
    Shiva, have argued for developing local science which is grounded in the
    civilisational ethos of India. Other well-known public intellectuals,
    including such stalwarts as Rajni Kothari, Veena Das, Claude Alvares and
    Shiv Vishwanathan, have thrown their considerable weight behind this
    civilisational view of knowledge. This perspective also has numerous
    sympathisers among &quot;patriotic science&quot; and the environmentalist
    and feminist movements. A defence of local knowledges against
    rationalisation and secularisation also underlies the fashionable theories
    of post-colonialism and subaltern studies, which have found a worldwide
    following through the writings of Partha Chatterjee, Gayatri Spivak, Homi
    Bhabha, Dipesh Chakrabarty and others. All these intellectuals and movements
    mentioned here have their roots in movements for social justice,
    environmental protection and women's rights - all traditional left-wing
    causes.
    <p align="justify">Social constructivist and postmodernist attacks on
    science have proven to be a blessing for <i>all</i> religious zealots, in
    all major faiths, as they no longer feel compelled to revise their
    metaphysics in the light of progress in our understanding of nature in
    relevant fields. But Hinduism displays a special resonance with the
    relativistic and holistic thought that finds favour among postmodernists. In
    the rest of this two-part paper, I will examine the general overlap between
    Hindu apologetics and postmodernist view of hybridity (part I) and
    alternative sciences (part II).
    <p align="justify"><font class="subsectionhead" color="red" size="3">Postmodern
    &quot;hybridity&quot; and Hindu eclecticism</font>
    <p align="justify">THE contemporary Hindu propagandists are inheritors of
    the 19th century neo-Hindu nationalists who started the tradition of
    dressing up the spirit-centered metaphysics of orthodox Hinduism in modern
    scientific clothes. The neo-Hindu intellectuals, in turn, were (consciously
    or unconsciously) displaying the well-known penchant of generations of
    Sanskrit pundits for drawing resemblances and correspondences between
    religious rituals, forces of nature and human destiny.
    <p align="justify">Postmodernist theories of knowledge have rehabilitated
    this &quot;method&quot; of drawing equivalences between different and
    contradictory worldviews and allowing them to &quot;hybridise&quot; across
    traditions. The postmodernist consensus is that since truth about the real
    world as-it-is cannot be known, all knowledge systems are equivalent to each
    other in being social constructions. Because they are all equally arbitrary,
    and none any more objective than other, they can be mixed and matched in
    order to serve the needs of human beings to live well in their own cultural
    universes. From the postmodern perspective, the VHP justification of the <i>guna</i>
    theory in terms of atomic physics is not anything to worry about: it is
    merely an example of &quot;hybridity&quot; between two different culturally
    constructed ways of seeing, a fusion between East and West, tradition and
    modernity. Indeed, by postmodernist standards, it is not this hybridity that
    we should worry about, but rather we should oppose the
    &quot;positivist&quot; and &quot;modernist&quot; hubris that demands that
    non-Western cultures should give up, or alter, elements of their inherited
    cosmologies in the light of the growth of knowledge in natural sciences. Let
    us see how this view of hybridity meshes in with the Hindutva construction
    of Vedic science.
    <p align="justify">It is a well-known fact that Hinduism uses its eclectic <i>mantra</i>
    - &quot;Truth is one, the wise call it by different names&quot; - as an
    instrument for self-aggrandisement. Abrahamic religions go about converting
    the Other through persuasion and through the use of physical force.
    Hinduism, in contrast, absorbs the alien Other by proclaiming its doctrines
    to be only &quot;different names for the One Truth&quot; contained in
    Hinduism's own Perennial Wisdom. The teachings of the outsider, the
    dissenter or the innovator are simply declared to be merely nominally
    different, a minor and inferior variation of the Absolute and Universal
    Truth known to Vedic Hindus from time immemorial. Christianity and Islam at
    least acknowledge the radical otherness and difference of other faiths, even
    as they attempt to convert them, even at the cost of great violence and
    mayhem. Hinduism refuses to grant other faiths their distinctiveness and
    difference, even as it proclaims its great &quot;tolerance&quot;. Hinduism's
    &quot;tolerance&quot; is a mere disguise for its narcissistic obsession with
    its own greatness.
    <p align="justify">Whereas classical Hinduism limited this
    passive-aggressive form of conquest to matters of religious doctrine,
    neo-Hindu intellectuals have extended this mode of conquest to secular
    knowledge of modern science as well. The tradition of claiming modern
    science as &quot;just another name&quot; for the spiritual truths of the
    Vedas started with the Bengal Renaissance. The contemporary Hindutva follows
    in the footsteps of this tradition.
    <p align="justify">The Vedic science movement began in 1893 when Swami
    Vivekananda (1863-1902) addressed the World Parliament of Religions in
    Chicago. In that famous address, he sought to present Hinduism not just as a
    fulfilment of all other religions, but also as a fulfilment of all of
    science. Vivekananda claimed that only the spiritual monism of Advaita
    Vedanta could fulfil the ultimate goal of natural science, which he saw as
    the search for the ultimate source of the energy that creates and sustains
    the world.
    <p align="justify">Vivekananda was followed by another Bengali
    nationalist-turned-spiritualist, Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950). Aurobindo
    proposed a divine theory of evolution that treats evolution as the
    adventures of the World-Spirit finding its own fulfilment through
    progressively higher levels of consciousness, from matter to man to the
    yet-to-come harmonious &quot;supermind&quot; of a socialistic collective.
    Newer theories of Vedic creationism, which propose to replace Darwinian
    evolution with &quot;devolution&quot; from the original one-ness with
    Brahman, are now being proposed with utmost seriousness by the Hare Krishnas
    who, for all their scandals and idiosyncrasies, remain faithful to the
    spirit of Vaishnava Hinduism.
    <p align="justify">Vivekananda and Aurobindo lit the spark that has
    continued to fire the nationalist imagination, right to the present time.
    The Neo-Hindu literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries, especially
    the writings of Dayanand Saraswati, S. Radhakrishnan and the many followers
    of Vivekananda, is replete with celebration of Hinduism as a
    &quot;scientific&quot; religion. Even secularists like Jawaharlal Nehru
    remained captive of this idea that the original teachings of Vedic Hinduism
    were consonant with modern science, but only corrupted later by the gradual
    deposits of superstition. Countless gurus and <i>swami</i>s began to teach
    that the Vedas are simply &quot;another name for science&quot; and that all
    of science only affirms what the Vedas have taught. This scientistic version
    of Hinduism has found its way to the West through the numerous <i>ashram</i>s
    and yoga retreats set up, most prominently, by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his
    many clones.
    <p align="justify">ALL these numerous celebrations of &quot;Vedas as
    science&quot; follow a similar intellectual strategy of finding analogies
    and equivalences. All invoke extremely speculative theories from modern
    cosmology, quantum mechanics, vitalistic theories of biology and
    parapsychology, and other fringe sciences. They read back these sciences
    into Sanskrit texts chosen at will, and their meaning decided by the whim of
    the interpreter, and claim that the entities and processes mentioned in
    Sanskrit texts are &quot;like&quot;, &quot;the same thing as&quot;, or
    &quot;another word for&quot; the ideas expressed in modern cosmology,
    quantum physics or biology. Thus there is a bit of a Brahman here and a bit
    of quantum mechanics there, the two treated as interchangeable; there are
    references to &quot;energy&quot;, a scientific term with a definite
    mathematical formulation in physics, which gets to mean
    &quot;consciousness&quot;; references to Newton's laws of action and
    reaction are made to stand for the laws of <i>karma</i> and reincarnation;
    completely discredited &quot;evidence&quot; from parapsychology and
    &quot;secret life of plants&quot; are upheld as proofs of the presence of
    different degrees of soul in all matter; &quot;evolution&quot; is taught as
    the self-manifestation of Brahman and so on. <i>The terms are scientific,
    but the content is religious</i>. There is no regard for consistency either
    of scientific concepts, or of religious ideas. Both wholes are broken apart,
    random connections and correspondences are established and with great
    smugness, the two modes of knowing are declared to be equivalent, and even
    inter-changeable. The only driving force, the only idea that gives this
    whole mish-mash any coherence, is the great anxiety to preserve and protect
    Hinduism from a rational critique and demystification. Vedic science is
    motivated by cultural chauvinism, pure and simple.
    <p align="justify">What does all this have to do with postmodernism, one may
    legitimately ask. Neo-Hinduism, after all, has a history dating back at
    least two centuries, and the analogical logic on which claims of Vedic
    science are based goes back to times immemorial.
    <p align="justify">Neo-Hinduism did not start with postmodernism, obviously.
    And neither does Hindutva share the postmodernist urgency to
    &quot;overcome&quot; and &quot;go beyond&quot; the modernist fascination
    with progress and development. Far from it. Neo-Hinduism and Hindutva are <i>reactionary
    modernist</i> movements, intent on harnessing a mindless and even dangerous
    technological modernisation for the advancement of a traditionalist, deeply
    anti-secular and illiberal social agenda. Nevertheless, they share a
    postmodernist philosophy of science that celebrates the kind of
    contradictory mish-mash of science, spirituality, mysticism and pure
    superstition that that passes as &quot;Vedic science&quot;.
    <p align="justify">For those modernists who share the Enlightenment's hope
    for overcoming ignorance and superstition, the value of modern science lies
    in its objectivity and universality. Modernists see modern science as having
    developed a critical tradition that insists upon subjecting our hypotheses
    about nature to the strictest, most demanding empirical tests and rigorously
    rejecting those hypotheses whose predictions fail to be verified. For the
    modernist, the success of science in explaining the workings of nature mean
    that sciences in other cultures have a rational obligation to revise their
    standards of what kind of evidence is admissible as science, what kind of
    logic is reasonable, and how to distinguish justified knowledge from mere
    beliefs. For the modernists, furthermore, modern science has provided a way
    to explain the workings of nature without any need to bring in supernatural
    and untestable causes such as a creator God, or an immanent Spirit.
    <p align="justify">For a postmodernist, however, this modernist faith in
    science is only a sign of Eurocentrism and cultural imperialism. For a
    postmodernist, other cultures are under no rational obligation to revise
    their cosmologies, or adopt new procedures for ascertaining facts to bring
    them in accord with modern science. Far from producing a uniquely objective
    and universally valid account of nature, the &quot;facts&quot; of modern
    science are only one among many other ways of constructing other
    &quot;facts&quot; about nature, which are equally valid for other cultures.
    Nature-in-itself cannot be known without imposing classifications and
    meaning on it which are derived from cultural metaphors and models. All ways
    of seeing nature are at par because all are equally culture-bound. Modern
    science has no special claims to truth and to our convictions, for it is as
    much of a cultural construct of the West as other sciences are of their own
    cultures.
    <p align="justify">This view of science is derived from a variety of
    American and European philosophies of science, associated mostly with such
    well-known philosophers as Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend, W.O Quine, Ludwig
    Wittgenstein and Michel Foucault. This view of science has been gaining
    popularity among Indian scholars of science since the infamous
    &quot;scientific temper&quot; debates in early 1980s when Ashis Nandy,
    Vandana Shiva and their sympathisers came out in defence of local knowledges
    and traditions, including astrology, goddess worship as cure for small-pox,
    taboos against menstruation and (later on) even <i>sati</i>. Over the next
    two decades, it became a general practice in Indian scholarly writing to
    treat modern science as just one way to adjudicate belief, no different from
    any other tradition of sorting out truth from mere group belief. Rationalism
    became a dirty word and Enlightenment became a stand-in for &quot;epistemic
    violence&quot; of colonialism.
    <p align="justify">According to those who subscribe to this relativist
    philosophy, the cross-cultural encounter between modern science and
    traditional sciences is not a confrontation between more and less objective
    knowledge, respectively. Rather it is a confrontation between two different
    cultural ways of seeing the world, neither of which can claim to represent
    reality-in-itself. Indeed, many radical feminists and post-colonial critics
    go even further: they see modern science as having lost its way and turned
    into a power of oppression and exploitation. They want non-Western people
    not just to resist science but to reform it by confronting it with their
    holistic traditional sciences.
    <p align="justify">What happens when traditional cultures <i>do</i> need to
    adopt at least some elements of modern knowledge? In such cases,
    postmodernists recommend exactly the kind of &quot;hybridity&quot; as we
    have seen in the case of Vedic sciences in which, for example, sub-atomic
    particles are interpreted as referring to <i>guna</i>s, or where quantum
    energy is interpreted to be the &quot;same as&quot; <i>shakti</i>, or where <i>karma</i>
    is interpreted to be a determinant of biology in a &quot;similar
    manner&quot; as the genetic code and so on. On the postmodern account, there
    is nothing irrational or unscientific about this &quot;method&quot; of
    drawing equivalences and correspondences between entirely unlike entities
    and ideas, even when there may be serious contradictions between the two. On
    this account, <i>all</i> science is based upon metaphors and analogies that
    reinforce dominant cultures and social power, and all &quot;facts&quot; of
    nature are really interpretations of nature through the lens of dominant
    culture. It is perfectly rational, on this account, for Hindu nationalists
    to want to reinterpret the &quot;facts&quot; of modern science by drawing
    analogies with the dominant cultural models supplied by Hinduism. Because no
    system of knowledge can claim to know reality as it really is, because our
    best confirmed science is ultimately a cultural construct, all cultures are
    free to pick and choose and mix various &quot;facts&quot;, as long as they
    do not disrupt their own time-honoured worldviews.
    <p align="justify">This view of reinterpretation of &quot;Western&quot;
    science to fit into the tradition-sanctioned, local knowledges of &quot;the
    people&quot; has been advocated by theories of &quot;critical
    traditionalism&quot; propounded by Ashis Nandy and Bhiku Parekh in India and
    by the numerous admirers of Homi Bhabha's obscure writings on &quot;hybridity&quot;
    abroad. In the West, this view has found great favour among feminists,
    notably Sandra Harding and Donna Haraway, and among anthropologists of
    science including Bruno Latour, David Hess and their followers.
    <p align="justify">To conclude, one finds a convergence between the
    fashionable left's position with the religious right's position on the
    science question. The extreme scepticism of postmodern intellectuals toward
    modern science has landed them in a position where they cannot, if they are
    to remain true to their beliefs, criticise Hindutva's eclectic take-over of
    modern science for the glory of the Vedic tradition.
