		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext">The Shiksa Andolan 
		Mancha (Platform for Education-Movement) formally launches its movement 
		to resist implementation of Government’s ill motivated proposed scheme 
		of one stream Education at SSC level (class IX – X). It may be recalled 
		that about a month or so ago the government all on a sudden declared 
		that it is bringing in a major reshuffling in the curriculum and 
		syllabus at SSC level from January 1, 2006. The first SSC examination 
		under this new scheme would be held in 2008. The government further 
		declared they have already made elaborate preparation to introduce the 
		new scheme. Syllabuses have been framed, books are being written and 
		selective publishers have been deputed to publish the books under new 
		syllabus of all subjects so that these are available to the students in 
		Early 2008. The government has made this decision of changing present 
		system of curriculum at SSC level unilaterally to a new curriculum. It 
		has already spent not less than 500 Crores of money (5,000 millions) in 
		Bangladesh currency (~ US $ 80 millions). This money has been advanced 
		by ADB (Asian Development Bank) as a loan. This means we the downtrodden 
		common people have to repay this loan for a futile and harmful cause. 
		With this money foreign expert advice has been, we believe, procured, 
		consultants for implementation of project and learned advice of writing 
		books etc must have been purchased and team of government 
		representatives visited many countries to study the SSC level system in 
		other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext">The nation did not 
		know, the students and their parents did not know that such a major 
		change is waiting for theme, _ that too all on a sudden. Without 
		consulting the teachers, teachers’ organizations, organizations related 
		to Education and Culture, guardians nor the students, the government, 
		backed by a set of bureaucrats, is trying to introduce this major change 
		in our curriculum at the SSC level. The scheme, it wants to implement 
		from the next year has been name ‘one stream education’ (in Bangla: <i>
		Ek Mukhi Shiksa</i>). &nbsp;</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: windowtext">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext">It may be recalled 
		that the Primary education is now compulsory and free (so called). And 
		boys and girls enter at the age of six plus. Up till now, in general 
		education system at Junior Secondary level (Class VI – VIII) same 
		curriculum and syllabus are followed for all students. At the Secondary 
		level i.e. from class IX specialization starts. At this level education 
		is primarily split into three streams introducing broad specialization 
		namely, <u>Science</u>, <u>Humanities</u> and <u>Commerce</u>. (See the 
		appendix for its details). There are other streams as well called 
		vocational and technical. At Higher Secondary level this specialization 
		further strengthened so that learners became adequately prepared for 
		entry into Higher education at the 
		University/Engineering/Medical/Agricultural institutes. The HSC is in 
		fact a linking between SSC and Higher Education as had been conceived by 
		the Calcutta University Commission of 1917 headed by Sadler.&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext">The new system as 
		intended by the government unifies the three existing stream (Science, 
		Humanities and Commerce) into one single stream eliminating the present 
		division. This means the concept of educating all students as is done at 
		Lower Secondary Level is being extended for further two years i.e. up to 
		Class X all boys and girls reading under general education system will 
		follow same curriculum and syllabus. This the government has termed as
		<i>Ekmukhee Shiksa (a combined or integrated education). (for details 
		see appendix)</i>. The specialty of the scheme is <u>to make religion 
		and commerce education compulsory for all students</u>. The Muslims will 
		read <i>Islam</i>, Christian students - <i>Christianity</i>, Hindu boys 
		and girls – <i>Hinduism </i>(Sanatan Dharma), Buddhists – <i>Buddhism</i>. 
		Not only that, the pupils studying Islam will have to take Arabic 
		language, Buddhist pupil – Pali, and Hindu pupils – Sanskrit. Thank God, 
		the government did not instruct that Christian boys would have to read 
		Latin. Making the religion as compulsory for the students of followers 
		of 4 religions, the system does not say what the students would study 
		who do not follow none of these religions.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext">&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: windowtext">What is the 
		philosophy of this change ?&nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext">The underlying ill 
		intention of the government is to kill the secular character of the 
		general education that we inherited from the British. The introduction 
		of this so called unified education at the SSC level will give an 
		Islamic bias, tilt and flavour to our education. Introduction of 
		commerce education as compulsory at this level is to make our students 
		business oriented. Output of such system will make our future generation 
		religious minded and business oriented-, which will ultimately create a 
		society infected with religious blindness and pleasure and luxury, 
		devoid of free and scientific thinking. The objective of such a move on 
		the part of the government is to produce a true Muslim, a true Hindu, a 
		true Christian, a true Buddhist – whatever those terms mean, but not to 
		produce a free thinker, a rationalist, a scientifically oriented mind 
		capable of tackling problems based on reason, logic, and scientific 
		procedure. If the government succeeds in its far-fetched design to 
		produce a society divided into religion based water tight compartments 
		the realization of an Islamic State from Modern Muslim State is just one 
		step far. The present demands made by the Islamic Fundamentalists 
		through terrorism and violence, to make our judicial system Islamic, our 
		state to be run by Shariah laws, Education to be islamized are quite 
		significant. Our government will soon start saying that this are 
		peoples’ demand we are just fulfilling these. These terrorists’ 
		activities are part of the design to achieve the goal of making 
		Bangladesh an Islamic State like Pakistan and Talebani governed 
		Afghanistan. Kheleda-Nizami Government does not hide their intention of 
		islamising our general education when its mouthpieces say:&nbsp;</span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext">1. “One stream

		</span>What do we mean by the term ‘<i>Sarbajanin</i>’ in Bangla ? We 
		are all familiar with English word Universal. We used the word ‘<i>Sarbajanin</i>’ 
		to express this meaning. Our cherished education system would be open to 
		all irrespective of religion, colour, caste or sect, community, gender 
		and socio-economic status- rich &amp; poor. This universality is not 
		confined within our state boundary- any citizen of any country can come 
		to learn through our education system. The equality is not confined to 
		social status only, our universal education system will offer scope of 
		learning all branches of knowledge and disciplines of the world. All

		<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: SutonnyMJ">Ôˆelg¨nxbÕ</span> 
		(non-discriminatory). By this word our intention to eliminate all sorts 
		of discrimination and differences existing in our present education 
		system has found expression. Discrimination and differences exist in 
		different stages – firstly from time immemorial diverse, even oppose or 
		contradictory to each other, system of education are in vogue in 
		parallel to each other having no correlation with each other. As a 
		result our educated class coming out through diverse systems are 
		confined in one’s watertight compartments in their mind and mentality, 
		in the quality of their achieved knowledge, in their thought and 
		analytical capability and in their outlook attitude towards the society 
		and the country. There practically exists no interrelation between one 
		class of people with other as a result of which no interaction and 
		intermingling take place among the people, which are very much essential 
		for making a developed society. For this very reason, between a madrasah 
		educated Moulana (Alem), an output of Madrasah education and a A-level 
		passed smart young man, an output of so called English Medium based 
		education a sky-like infinite distinction being constantly generated in 
		their respective philosophy of life. There exists discrepancy in having 
		facilities between male and female students, between village and urban 
		based education facilities, between rich and poor etc. Our proposed 
		education infrastructure would make no discrepancy between village and 
		town, between upper and lower social positions, between religion and 
		religion and among social cases. The education system that promises to 
		make equal facilities available to a student living in a distance 
		village or living in a city-bustee we may term a non-discriminatory. The 
		system that holds and preserves the concept of universalism is the true 
		non-discriminatory education system, which will make a student a true

		</span>The word ‘Secularism’ is a very touchy and at the same time a 
		hateful word to the present government which carries a meaning ‘devoid

		social system whose fundamental basis is composed of such concepts as- 
		humanism, pluralism and unity in diversity. As we want to see secularism 
		is deeply rooted in our state-life, in a similar way we want secularism 
		with its true spirit reflected in our education system. In other words 
		it means there would be no such education system that is reserved for 
		followers of a particular religion or class. There would be no 
		significant role of religions in our curriculum, syllabuses or in 
		composition of textbooks. Pupils belonging to all religions, all

		through it becomes a scientific minded, will possess mind of 
		freethinking, liberalism and rationalism. Nay, the object of the 
		proposed education system is not to produce only scientists, engineers, 
		doctors or agriculturists. What we mean is that through our education 
		system we want to make our learners analytical based on facts and proofs 
		making them capable of solving a problem(s) as a scientist does, where 
		superstitions or blind faith have no place. Through this process a free 
		and liberal minded society would immerge. This is what we call

		</span></span>Now what we mean by ‘Ekmukhi’ (<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: SutonnyMJ">GKgyLx</span>)? 
		The term may translated in English as one stream or unitary, <u>not 
		‘mono-disciplinary</u>’. The clear meaning of the term is that a learner 
		acquires his education and thereby knowledge in different disciplines 
		from primary to highest level of education a unitary form of education 
		system. If we could establish such a unitary or one stream education in 
		our life, then currently existing different streams of education giving 
		systems such as ‘general education’, ‘madrasah-maktab-tol-chathuspathi’ 
		types of educational infrastructures, and the so called ‘English medium 
		education from kindergarten to O/A level’ will automatically get 
		dissolved. At present in ‘general education system students’ receive 
		education having same curriculum and syllabus from primary to lower 
		secondary level (class I to class VIII). After lower secondary level, at 
		Secondary level (class IX-X), the students are offered specialization in 
		three broad disciplines namely (i) humanities, (ii) science and (iii) 
		commerce. At higher secondary level (class XI – XII) this specialization
