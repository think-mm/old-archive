              If one <em>disagrees</em> that a faith-based claim of&nbsp;fact is

              that He mandated this garb, the&nbsp;entire discussion about its

              When an adult Muslima tells her little girl this is what Allah
              wants, is she&nbsp;lying&nbsp;or should her sincerity of faith in
              Allah automatically redefine the nature of her claim&nbsp;as
              truth, and nothing but?</font>

              endorsing its need in the same manner she was TOLD since
              childhood, and if she feels socially pressured to wear it, will it
              NOT be a lie to claim she wears it simply and <em>only</em>

              When in a Muslim majority country the government takes it upon
              itself to define people's morality in this context and enforces
              this garb on women, both Muslims and non-Muslims as it is the case&nbsp;in
              Saudi Arabia, (I&nbsp;admit I am not 100% sure if it is indeed the
              case for non-Muslims in SA), is it more reasonable to suggest they
              are being moral bullyies when Islam accorded no&nbsp;preferential
              treatment to the ruler as a moral arbiter for others, or might you
              consider that enforced&nbsp;morality acceptable by Allah?</font>

              history clearly tells us how the Prophet lived and what he chatted
              about sometimes. But has&nbsp;there been an addendum&nbsp;from God&nbsp;to
              <em>alter</em> some of it, a few examples of which I enumerated
              above? Why did we need <em>interpreters </em>of verses when their

              the wheel?&nbsp; Besides, <font color="#ff0000">how could Islam be

              Why was Bibi Ayesha's age a non-issue for centuries but, only in
              recent times, there seems to be disagreement&nbsp;among Islamic
              apologists about her age? Were the Muslims, including Imam Bukhari,
              grossly erroneous&nbsp;in&nbsp;quoting Ayesha's age? If yes,&nbsp;what
              new discovery have modern Islamic apologists made, and where, by
              which to override some shahi hadiths?</font>

              Last but not least, how do you propose Muslims establish a
              tolerant common ground with people of all other faiths when the
              very purpose of the Quran was to deliver Allah's last words and&nbsp;when
              it claims it <u>supercedes</u> all previous texts from God?&nbsp;When
              others with whom Muslims seek to establish common, tolerant ground
              may not agree with this faith claim of superiority.</font>

              Could this direct claim from Allah&nbsp;be <u>subordinated</u> in
              Islam without deviating from&nbsp;His wishes, just so that Muslim
              negotiators of common ground could offer a&nbsp;truthful frame&nbsp;of
              equal respect of&nbsp;other faiths in Islam?</font>

            probably agree there is much misinformation on the internet&nbsp;about
            Islam currently. The tragedy of 0911 served as gateway for many
            communal sentiments to unleash their hatred of Islam. But the&nbsp;intolerant
            attitude of many Muslims did also&nbsp;contribute to justify the
            backlash.&nbsp;I have argued with anti-Islamists for months&nbsp;whenever
            I considered&nbsp;their conclusions logically indefensible, such as
            eradication of Islam (implied force), while also claiming to uphold

      </b></font><b>Shah Abdul Hannan.&nbsp;<u><br>
      </u></b>
    </div>
    Dear Moderator:<br>
    <br>
    Assalamu Alaikum,<br>
    <br>
    I have seen some of the correspondence on Hijab in Banglar Nari Mailing
    list.&nbsp; I can not probably change the position of some of the writers by
    my comments. However I feel that part of the confusion can be removed if we
    can properly understand the meaning of the word “Hijab” and its
    application on the dress code of Muslims Women.<br>
    <br>
    The meaning of Hijab in some of the dictionaries are as follows :<br>
    <br>
    <font face="Times New Roman, Times" size="5">1.<X>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</X>
    </font>Hijab means cover, wrap, drape, curtain.<br>
    (A dictionary of Modern Written Arabic edited b J.Milton Cowan)<br>
    <br>
    2.(a)Hajaba means to cover, shut out<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; (b)Hijab means veil, curtain.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (John Prentice:Adictionary of Glossary of the Quran)<br>
    <br>
    3.Hijab in Lugat(Dictionary or language) is Satr(cover)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (Encyclopedia of Fiqh,Kuwait)<br>
    <br>
    4.Hijab means Satr( or cover).(Lisanul Arab)<br>
    <br>
    5.Hijab means to obstruct. Cover is called Hijab as it obstructs seeing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    (Al Misbah Al Munir)<br>
    <br>
    There are many other dictionaries&nbsp; explaining the meaning of the
    Quranic/Arabic. words which give more or less same meanings.<br>
    <br>
    The above clarifies that Hijab essentially means cover of all kinds (whether
    of dress or curtain or darkness or otherwise) which obstructs seeing.<br>
    <br>
    In this context the use of the term Hijab for dress code of Muslim women is
    nothing wrong. If others want to use other terms for Muslim Women dress
    code, they can do so.<br>
    <br>
    There is no disagreement among scholars on the extent of cover of the Muslim
    Women (except in the matter of face, feet and forehand) A few opinions of
    non-experts do not matter.<br>
    <br>
    Terms develop over time to express ideas. In the history of Islam so many
    words have taken gradually technical meaning such as Sunnah, Ijma, Qiyas,
    Istihsan. Hijab has also now taken a technical meaning for Muslim Woman’s&nbsp;
    dress here is nothing wrong in it.<br>
    <br>
    I hope the explanation will be helpful to the members of the group.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Yours sincerely<br>
    <br>
    Shah Abdul Hannan.&nbsp;<br>
