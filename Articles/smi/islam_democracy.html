    <p class="MsoNormal"><br>
    <br>
    Many Muslims insist that Islam must have a political dimension. This
    insistence is nothing new. In Europe and later in the US church leaders
    insisted similarly, and unsuccessfully.<br>
    <br>
    Why is it an issue whether religions should have political dimension? Isn't
    it a fact that, between the two, there is inherent incompatibility: reason
    tends to guide most decisions of modern governments whereas at many levels,
    faith drives applicative justification of religions?<br>
    <br>
    Do Muslims understand the reasons why Western societies evolved to separate
    Christianity from politics? Do they assign merit to that separation or do
    they feel that modern western, secular countries would have been better off
    had they retained a 'religious dimension' in politics? According to some
    faithful Christians of both past and present, it was a blunder to separate
    religion from state. Yet, what do historical facts reveal, if we compare
    pre-secular western societies to their post-secular makeover?<br>
    <br>
    The US was founded on secular principles. The majority of its inhabitants
    have accepted that, even though a handful of puritanical citizens still hope
    for a 'Christ-based' political posturing of priests and pastors, as
    'cure-all' for all of its alleged secular evils. As Muslim gain more
    political foothold, might they propose a modification to its secular
    principles to include Islamic religious influence, in the manner it was
    (illegally) done to the Constitution of Bangladesh after Sheikh Mujibur
    Rahman's assassination? Examples of Christian failure at it notwithstanding.<br>
    <br>
    In this regard I wish to refer to the 1990 Cairo Convention of Human Rights
    in Islam. What was the Islamic issue with UN Universal Declaration of Human
    Rights that many attendants refused to endorse, drafting and signing an
    ISLAMIC Human Rights Declaration instead? Muslim apologists contend Islam is
    compatible with universal human rights. Then why did they need an Islamic
    twist on that declaration?<br>
    <br>
    To establish Islam's lust for political dimension, how likely is it that
    Muslim apologists will re-engage in interpretive rehash to neutralize some
    pungent Quranic verses, while upholding select other verses that support
    their faith-based arguments?<br>
    <br>
    Interpretive differences in Islam have been a sore issue that birthed
    endless essays from Islamic scholars. Present Islamic traditions in
    countries that starkly contrast our current, rational notions of equal
    rights for minorities and women have been interpreted as unIslamic. How do
    Muslims propose to validate the accuracy of any such interpretation for use
    in politics, when it seems unlikely typically-absentee Allah will be at hand
    to confirm it?<br>
    <br>
    My main reservation against arguments for political dimension of Islam is
    that, just like other Abrahamic religions, it divisive approach to humanity
    is based upon little else but faith. Unlike many global Muslims, the
    majority of modern Christians, Hindus, Jews or Buddhists do not seem as
    collectively agitated over separation of religion from politics.<br>
    <br>
    Many moral guidelines based on religion contradict each other--it is a fact.
    Some Muslims contend religion ought to inform and guide political discourse
    and debate. It is a fact that the primary basis for moral guidelines in
    religion is faith. How do Muslims propose to resolve those contradictions if
    Islam were made part of political discourse, when its main basis is faith
    and NOT reason and rationality that mark modern political discourses? More
    pressing seems the question whether Muslims would admit there can be
    universal guidelines for morality and human rights--women's and minority
    rights, that global population can agree upon through rational discourse of
    fairness without invoking fear of hellfire, etc. in afterlife---a mainstay
    of most religions.<br>
    <br>
    What moral codes are so exclusive and useful according to Islam that their
    exclusion from political discourse would undermine fair representation of
    Muslims? I would like their enumeration from Muslim apologists, for
    starters.<br>
    <br>
    While religions may have a 'right' to inform and guide politics, we must
    also acknowledge their history of creating false social reality by dividing
    people on the arbitrary basis of faith. In context I'm distinguishing
    scriptures from the way any religion has been practiced throughout history.
    In India, for example, there is history of Muslim rulers practicing
    secularism, allowing each religion to practice its rituals and morality.<br>
    <br>
    Nonetheless, one can cite verses from both the Bible and the Quran, divisive
    pungency of which scholarly believers may not interpret away. Before
    insisting on inclusion of religious morality in politics, apologists must
    acknowledge the falsity of their morality claims based upon unprovable
    faith.<br>
    <br>
    Modern politics is an evolving phenomenon that has its own set of
    complexities, but use of logic and reason in matters common to us all seems
    to help not only to contain their scope, but also to approach their
    resolution via rational discourse. &nbsp;What might be the gain to devolve
    to pre-secular days, instead, to include religions to inform and guide
    politics, birthing futile debates over intra and inter-religious differences
    in moral guidelines? Let's ask those Muslims that contend inclusion of
    religion in politics, to explain their vision how such debates might benefit
    humans in general, and Muslims in particular.<br>
    <br>
    The argument to let Islam influence politics--not only in Muslim-majority
    countries but also in secular countries where transplanted Muslims are
    gaining political foothold--seems to have missed/ignored all political
    developments beyond theocracy-based systems.<br>
    <br>
    Dismal failure of religion-based/influenced governments to manage their
    citizenry, as it is evident in most Islamic countries today, Muslim
    apologists tend to interpret away as contra-Islamic. All of it, and no less.
    Other Muslim scholars tag such failure singly to activities of non-Islamic
    countries, and no less. All based on interpretations when facts that may
    reveal the opposite are systematically ignored. This however is no surprise
    and in line with their insistence to alter objective social reality with
    false reality based on nothing but faith.<br>
    <br>
    My question to Muslim apologists: What defensible, rational basis beyond the
    purity of faith will retain a 'political dimension' for Islam, offering not
    just-as-good an alternative to, but possibly much more 'moral' an outcome
    than secular alternatives preferred in Western countries? In this regard
    they may offer reasonable analyses about the net outcome from variants of
    Islamic theocracies that we have seen in today's world.<br>
    <br>
    Thinking forward, what might be the timeline for such Islamic alternative to
    curdle into a first born? I ask because arguments in its support seem
    pervasive. What are the practical aspects of such alternative? As a secular
    citizen of the United States, I ask because I'd be happy to lend support to
    any potential exodus of its Muslims to countries offering such informed and
    guided alternative--AWAY from the western secular countries where many
    Islamic apologists in search of a better life now live.<br>
    <br>
    Global humanity will then have two alternatives for political system:
    Islamic understanding of modernity, with religion offering information and
    guidance to government--more moral, at least by faith according to Muslims
    and also in line with Allah's wishes, versus Western politics that is not
    good enough for Muslims to endorse AS IS--secular, where faith-based
    religion does not meddle into reason-based political debates and discourses.<br>
