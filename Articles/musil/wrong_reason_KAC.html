  <p>This is in response to Mr. Khurshed Chowdhury article: <a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/article/Khurshed/supporting_palestinians_for_all.htm">Supporting
  Palestinians for all the wrong reasons</a>.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>Your views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict reflect a definite lack of
  understanding not only the roots of the problem, but also the status-quo. When
  you give equal morality to both Israelis and Palestinians in their fight to
  acquire land in Palestine, you certainly have obliterated justice, morality
  and international legality from your thesis. When you justify Mr. Sharon’s
  violence against the innocent civilians under the guise of fighting “terrorism”
  you have shown a definite lack of understanding Mr. Sharon and his motives.
  When you give a certain religious groups the right to a political “sovereignty”
  over somebody else’s land, you have advocated the right of all individual
  religions to have a country of their own, thus advocating the redrawing of the
  entire map of the world. Should the Buddhists, the Catholics, the Moslems and
  hundreds of other religions seek to form exclusive political sovereignty over
  any land in the name of religion?</p>
  <p>When the Balfour declaration was initiated in 1917 demanding that the Jews
  should have the right to a home in Palestine, the population of the country
  was almost 650,000 Arabs ( Christians and Moslems) with 55000 Jews. The land
  distribution was 94% owned by Arabs and 6.5% Jewish. From 1917 until 1947
  massive Jewish immigration took place with the help of the British ( who were
  in control under the Mandate) that has changed the demographic balance to 33%
  Jewish and 67% Arabs. The influx of Jews into Palestine was in conformity with
  declared intentions of the Zionist organization (Led by Haim Weizman) to
  create in Palestine an exclusive Jewish state. As documented by the Israeli
  historian Benny Morris and many others, such an objective could not be
  actuated as “anyway you divide it you would have an Arab majority). How can
  a group create an exclusive Jewish state with the indigenous Palestinians
  representing the majority? Therefore the logical solution was to uproot and
  transfer the majority Palestinians out of the Jewish state by the use of
  force. This was done in 1947-1948 using numberless massacres ( like Haifa,
  Jaffa, Nahaleen, Dir Yassin etc..) . Over 800,000 Palestinians were evicted
  and turned into miserable refugees. Remember that the 1947 UN Partition
  strictly prohibited the expulsion of any individual from either state to the
  other. Did the Palestinians reject the Partition? Yes and who wouldn’t?
  Would you accept to cede half of your home to a foreign insurgent free of
  charge? What right does a Jew from Hungary, Poland or any other country have
  in stealing somebody else’s land? Don’t tell me that the Bible says so, as
  such travesty could not be accepted by anyone. If we apply land ownership by
  using Bible historical claims the entire map of the world has to change
  through violence and calamities that are unimaginable.</p>
  <p>Then you naively repeat the Zionist cheap propaganda that Mr. Sharon is
  only fighting “ terrorism” when he attacks civilians in Gaza and the West
  Bank. Obviously you are not familiar with the Likud and the Israeli fanatic
  right. Their intentions are to create in the entire land in Palestine a Jewish
  controlled government. Read the Natanyaho- Sharon plan to acquire more land in
  Palestine and also read the Likud agenda for Palestine. Why do you think the
  wall was built on 20% more of the West Bank? You think our objection to the
  wall was due to separation? They call build a china wall as far as I am
  concerned, but not on more of my land Mr. Chowdhury. Realizing these
  historical, facts, the UN has adopted many resolutions demanding that Israel
  withdraws to its international borders and allow the Palestinian refugees to
  return. Mr. Sharon could have acquired peace in less than 24 hours if he
  simply accepted any of the signed agreements, be it camp David 11, Taba, Sharm
  El-Sheikh, Oslo and many others. Israel was given guarantees by the US that
  Israel’s borders and security would be guaranteed by the super-power if only
  they would accept to implement all the agreements especially the ones
  sponsored by the US. Mr. Sharon is not fighting “terrorism”, he is
  fighting the right of Palestinians to their freedom and independence on their
  shrunk piece of land in Palestine. Give me a break Mr. Chowdhury! I’ll be
  glad to supply you with any documentation to prove the above. Before you jump
  to the conclusion that my motives are purely Islamic, I would like you to know
  that I am a Palestinian Christian.</p>
