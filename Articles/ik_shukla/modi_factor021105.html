	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Well timed in the evening, targeting 
	Eid and Diwali shoppers for dramatic effect, the three bomb blasts in 
	Delhi’s three most populous and popular areas on Oct.29 destroyed far more 
	than only 70 innocent lives and over 115 injured. Whose purpose this wanton 
	massacre served, how it advanced a cause, whom the criminals sought to 
	avenge, whom they so brutally taught a lesson, whether this is a prologue to 
	the series of blasts in gestation, and where and when next – we will never 
	know, because our law and order machinery is unwilling and unable to probe 
	it all. As has been the practice thus far, glibly or sagely it can all be 
	laid at the doors of ISI, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and, of course, the ubiquitous 
	monster Al Qaeda, which goes on getting invented endlessly for a 
	multiplicity of purposes and by a slew of ever ready users. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First, the police alacrity 
	post-blasts. The whole city was covered with police patrol. Isn’t that 
	something the citizenry is expected to be grateful for? Why the intelligence 
	failed to prime itself prior to the mayhem, or why it did not consider 
	posting patrols in the dense shopping centres when it had received 
	intimations of such threats materializing soon, which was what it could and 
	should have done as the most minimum required in the name of civil safety, 
	passes understanding. But, the establishment will not admit it was careless 
	or clueless or incompetent. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The other, ancillary question, from 
	just not the usual run of skeptics. Why was this carnage timed to burn and 
	blacken the bonhomie increasingly gathering strength and volume between the 
	peoples of Pakistan and India? Whoever did it must have a vested interest in 
	keeping the jihadi or patriotic pot boiling. Not above suspicion are the two 
	nations’ institutional cabals of warmongers who, with peace and normalcy 
	prospectively regnant, will be grievously bereft of their vested interest, 
	their venal cause. These cabals can be political heavyweights, political 
	parties, and the entrenched bureaucracies of the two nations who have to 
	upstage each other just for the fun of it- grandstanding, keeping the other 
	flustered and short of breath are such pure fun in underhand politicking!
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One aspect that by some unwritten 
	but suspicious compact, always gets omitted from consideration, both in the 
	media and government circles, is the Modi Factor. This is a small name for a 
	large but lethal enterprise. The enterprise is Hindutva : liquidation of 
	minorities in well-planned series of massacres, seemingly random, localized, 
	and dressed up as “reaction”. This experiment of ethnic cleansing has 
	signally succeeded in Gujarat. The plight of Gujarat Muslims ever since the 
	2002 genocide has remained abysmal, if the recent reports of Kuldip Nayar 
	and Harsh Mander are any guide. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No criminals were punished. Killers, 
	rapists, arsonists, thugs and assassins were lionized as Hindu heroes. The 
	saffronazi cult of crime and the dagger-invested brotherhood of mobsters, 
	upgraded, the former as Hindu religion and the latter as its exemplars, were 
	admitted, without any shame or apology or remorse, into national polity as 
	legitimate constituents. It is this which on the one hand has led to a 
	feeling of helplessness and humiliation among the victims and survivors, the 
	state reduced in this perception as complicit or co-sponsor of the crimes of 
	Hindu terrorists, and on the other a very starkly demonstrable proof of a 
	failed state catering with determination to the interests of fascist 
	gangsters and theo-terrorists, which cannot be confronted other than by its 
	own methods of terror and tyranny, indiscriminate, endless, and unrelenting.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The continual murders of Christians 
	all over and their churches being vandalized and burnt, the non-stop murders 
	of Muslims, more grimly and recurrently in western UP, the calls by Hindu 
	outfits on BJP aggressively to pursue the Hindutva agenda, their main 
	warlord Sudarshan’s assertion that there are no minorities in India except 
	Parsis and Jews, and any slight concession to justice or even a modicum of 
	legalistic equality in bourgeois terms is tantamount to appeasement, none of 
	them being arrested or prosecuted for harboring killers and funding 
	criminals – all the mounting congeries of ever swelling volume of violence 
	and terror against the minorities stresses the obvious repeatedly that the 
	state in India is mired in a big failure, and that violence prevails both to 
	undermine the state constitutionally and to indulge in ethnic cleansing with 
	impunity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whether the government at the centre 
	was BJP’s is immaterial in so far as the constitutional safeguards were 
	concerned in the case of Gujarat. There was a glaring case for the President 
	to dismiss the delinquent government of Vajpayee. Then, the UPA government 
	in New Delhi could have remedied the situation by kicking out Modi 
	government. But, popular, “democratically elected” government seemed to have 
	held UPA’s hand. There was no such compunction on the part of Congress when 
	it had sacked the Kerala government of Namboodiripad on far trivial excuses 
	in the 1950s. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the Hindutva book Red Indians are 
	not a minority because they belonged to the land. That they were massacred 
	in millions to render them into a besieged minority is not a fact to bother 
	him. That 1 million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in Turkey’s 
	genocide by state connivance and sponsorship in 1917 too would not matter to 
	him, despite the fact that both had lived there for hundreds of years. He 
	would refuse to see they were the minorities singled out for liquidation 
	just as Hindutva has singled out Christians and Muslims. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Whether this violence was a plant or 
	a vengeance of the weak we will perhaps never know. But, if we seek to have 
	a grip on the situation, we will have to look deeper, look farther. What our 
	police and military are capable of in terms of cold blooded murder in the 
	lock up or fake encounters is public knowledge. Our army excelled itself in 
	Chattisinghpura in Kashmir by slaughtering in cold blood 24 Sikhs and laying 
	the crime at the doors of the militants, the more savagely to pursue them 
	and win awards. Such plants are endemic to the institutional imperatives of 
	a repressive state. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As to vengeance. Those guilty of the 
	murders of Christians, those guilty of the genocide in Gujarat 2002, those 
	killing Dalits and adivasis in various urban and rural locations, must be 
	seen punished, or the state would seem to have nullified itself. It is the 
	frustration of the victims which may be stirring, however blindly, to resort 
	to these wanton acts of terror. The perpetrators may not even care if they 
	are thus helping the victims of state terror or inducing the state to 
	intensify its regime of unremitting terrorism on the minorities. Did the 
	shoppers in Paharganj, Govindpuri, and Sarojini Nagar not include Muslims?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Two issues that are not so apart 
	must be broached here. BJP has denounced Punjab government for the statues 
	of seven terrorists in Ludhiana. It should have begun with denouncing itself 
	for the two statues raised in Gujarat to its own terrorists. Two, have we 
	not failed, as in Gujarat, to validate our claims and honor the 
	constitutional guarantees in the case of Kashmir pulverized by quake? Have 
	we done enough, and fast, and well to reach people there the much needed 
	help and succor? Or, the Hindu “majority (a fiction) is happy to get 
	Kashmir, but cleansed by nature of thousands of Muslims? These utterances 
	are not limited to a crazy fringe in India any more. And, they unmask us 
	both as a state and tarnish us a society. The report of our national 
	endeavor there are not upbeat (Yogi Sikand: countercurrents.org). </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rounding up of Muslim youths 
	following each such mayhem, torturing them, destroying their families with 
	violent meanness and reckless mendacity, concluding even without any 
	preliminary inquiry of substance that it was Al Qaeda or Lashkar-i-Tayyeba 
	which caused the blasts, is, to put it mildly, both to revel in dereliction 
	of duty, and promote terrorism for establishmentarian ends. </font></p>
