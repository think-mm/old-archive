	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why has this Bible of Hindutwa, 
	first published in 1939, succeeded by four reprints until 1947, been 
	withdrawn from RSS shelves and made unavailable to the general public? Why 
	has its authorship been denied, fudged over, and brazenly lied about in a 
	concerted manner, among others including the author, by Lalchand K. Advani, 
	Atal B.Vajpeyi, and David Frawley, who outdid all with three big lies in 
	just two sentences: 1. Golwalkar just translated it, 2. in 1938, and 3. “it 
	was only part of the general literature of the times that he was examining.”
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How fanatically vicious Golwalkar 
	was in laying down his version of Mein Kampf informs this major handbook of 
	Hindu fascism wherein he strips himself for condemnation and revulsion as an 
	evil ogre of Dark ages. The long and well-researched Introduction by Prof. 
	Islam in itself has become an invaluable asset for serious researchers, 
	scholarly academics, and committed activists. He deserves kudos for 
	retrieving Golwalkar’s poison-spewing book, always revered by RSS and its 
	affiliates, and widely regarded as the Bible of Hindutwa fascists, among 
	others, by two CIA agents close to them – Jean A. Curran (author of Militant 
	Hinduism in Indian Politics: A Study of the RSS, 1951) and Craig Baxter 
	(author of The Jana Sangh: A Biography of an Indian Political Party, 1969).
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An aside for relieving the tedium is 
	in order. How shallow was Golwalkar becomes clear from his mention of names 
	of historical importance in the field of literature: Sharatchandra 
	Chakrawarti, Babu Premchand (p. 42). I had never known of them. Golwalkar 
	had casually heard these names and embellished them with his imagination. 
	This imagination is at full play in his understanding, skewed and sickly, of 
	history, human civilization, culture, and modern polity. No wonder only such 
	a one could call Hindutwa “anadi” (without a beginning, beyond history, and 
	pre-historical). His repeated use of the word “scientific” is comic and 
	contemptible, and his exhilaration at Fatherland a slavish adoption of the 
	German word Vaterland with all its concomitant evils fleshing it out. This 
	unabashed and implacable devotee of three evil Ms - Manu, Mill (James, East 
	India Company’s employee, hack historian, who partitioned Indian History 
	into three divisions: Hindu, Muslim, British, 1817, -not Christian-) , and 
	Mussolini, besides Hitler, regarded them all as great regenerators and 
	benefactors of mankind! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The riddle is why the Hindutwa 
	luminaries and lumpens who have always venerated this Bible of Hindu fascism 
	are fighting shy of it at present. Not that they have abjured its ideology 
	of racial hatred and violence against non-Hindus, of ethnic extremism and 
	bloody purge, of India as the fatherland of Hindus only, once more 
	adumbrated without any remission in Golwalkar’s later book Bunch of 
	Thoughts. The reason for this coyness and concealment is a mix of cowardice 
	and criminality that have distinguished the bloody enterprise of the 
	Hindutwa cult since its inception. It has vindicated its assassination of 
	Gandhi on January 1948 by a recurrent series of mass slaughters since 1992 
	of Muslims, Christians, and others it decreed to be non-Hindu. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Gandhi’s murder the involvement 
	of RSS became too evident, too undeniable for it to escape unscathed. Hence, 
	a new political creature of Hindu communalism, Jan Sangh, was fabricated. 
	Hence too the disavowal of Golwalkar’s book We or Our Nationhood Defined, as 
	an expedient. What, howeve,r the book had already achieved remarkably 
	successfully through its wide diffusion was to remain inviolate, i.e., its 
	racist precepts and its politically invidious indoctrination of the masses. 
	The ban on RSS on 4 Feb.1948 was a temporary glitch, but it was also a 
	safety valve, curiously, helping RSS more than hindering it. The legal 
	hibernation thus secured, it went ahead with its perfidies and pogroms, 
	neither handicapped, nor humbled. The title of this seminal booklet was well 
	chosen, not in a symbolic but in quite a substantive sense. It defined the 
	Hindutwa cult of crime and sedition, as it defiled the Indian nationhood at 
	the same time. It thus upheld treason as virtue, pitched terrorism as duty, 
	tyranny as statecraft, and theocracy as polity. The sinister screed had 
	achieved its squalid ends well. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It would be apposite to quote the 
	redoubtable RSS stalwart of yesteryears, Prof.Balraj Madhok on Vajpeyi and 
	Advani, as extremely pertinent to the criminality that has characterized RSS 
	all along. How did Advani climb the organizational ladder? : </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“The position of Lal Krishan Advani 
	was like a puppet. He was not capable for the post (presidentship of BJS) 
	which was given to him after discarding many senior workers. I knew through 
	my personal experience that he is a boneless wonder. He has neither personal 
	integrity nor opinion. But he is lucky. The office which he had got due to 
	the offerings (prasad) of Vajpayee and officials of Sangh, keeping aside its 
	honour, he acted as a bonded labourer, for any work assigned to him.” (p. 
	146, Zindagi Ka Safar- 3: Deendayal Upadhyay Ki Hatya Se Indira Gandhi Ki 
	Hatya Tak, 2003, Delhi). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And on Vajpayee: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Sometime back when I was the 
	President of Jana Sangh, Jagadish Prasad Mathur, in charge of the Central 
	Office, who was staying with Atal Bihari at 30, Rajendra Prasad Road, had 
	complained to me that Atal had turned that house into a den of immoral 
	activities. There everyday new girls were coming…” (p.25, Ibid.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Madhok points out unreservedly to 
	the triad of Vajpayee, Nana Deshmukh and Balasaheb Deoras, responsible for 
	the murder of Dendayal Upadhyaya in 1968 at Mughalsarai Railway junction, 
	having been patronized by Golwalkar, popular as Guru in the RSS lore. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These qualifications and attributes, 
	essential to Hindutwa, have propelled it onward. It earned its cherished 
	laurels as a den of cutthroats, kleptomaniacs, womanizers, rapists, 
	arsonists, terrorists and traitors by remaining constant to its cultist 
	pledge of grime and gore. For unraveling its various layers of diabolical 
	and anti-national crimes in such a painstakingly thorough manner, and 
	highlighting the threat they pose to the unity and security of the nation, 
	the author has put us all in his debt.</font></p>
