	Humayun Azad, 57, found dead on 12 August 2004 in his apartment in Munich, 
	signaled the diabolically planned culmination of the murderous 27 Feb. 
	attack on him in Dhaka, on the road across Bangla Academy, on his way back 
	from the annual Dhaka Book Fair. Everything in the murder of this widely 
	respected, versatile and prolific writer and erudite scholar of Bangladesh 
	was so riddled with political mayhem and pervasive mystery that all of 
	Bangladesh was shaken to its roots and engulfed in massive national mourning 
	as never before. In his death both hope and history seemed entombed as 
	planned by the assassins.<br>
	<br>
	This comes out brilliantly in the ten essays constituting his last book, 
	published posthumously, <b>Amar Natun Janmo</b> (My New Birth), Agamee 
	Prakashani, Dhaka, Feb. 2005. The writer of over sixty books in various 
	genres seems to have left, perhaps presciently, his manifesto and testament 
	in these essays, written on various burning issues from time to time, and 
	included in this slim volume of 96 pages. Analytical and perspicacious, 
	these essays would remain relevant for long and for all of the Indian 
	sub-continent, and quite as tenaciously pertinent to the present and future 
	of Bangladesh as a nation state. Those who love Bangladesh as Humayun Azad 
	did, would find this ineffable work an indispensable guide, and a clarion 
	call to thwart the demolition squad of traitors, theo-terrorists, and thugs 
	rampaging all over Bangladesh today.<br>
	<br>
	The essays are titled: 1. My New Birth, 2.Open Letter to Prime Minister, 
	Opposition Leader, and Fellow Citizens, 3. Banning the Publications of 
	Ahmadiya Muslim Jamat: Has Bangladesh Become Talibani Afghanistan?, 4. My 
	First Book, 5. State Terror: From Democracy to Nationalist Repression, 6. 
	New York Journal, 7. Poet's Struggle, 8. Me, <br>
	9. Scrutinize the Source of the Taliban, 10. Human Rights and Writer's 
	Freedom: Perspective Bangladesh.<br>
	<br>
	The titles represent Azad's universal vision, his humanist philosophy, and 
	his ideal of a democratic and egalitarian society comprehensively, though I 
	will be quoting just a few<br>
	slivers mainly from two pieces, viz., the first and the last, nos. 1 and 10. 
	This being neither a eulogy nor a requiem, I will resort to an attenuated 
	mode of recit eclate, a procedure which the French call -- shattered, 
	exploded, or splintered narrative. (Forche, Ibid.). For rendering a proper 
	eulogy I may be presently ill qualified and hence uninclined; for a requiem, 
	I insist on a studied No. That would negate and invalidate all his work, his 
	martyrdom, and his legacy. Let his memory keep scholars and writers, 
	activists and artists in Bangladesh, always anguished and agitated as to the 
	price he paid for the freedom of thought and expression, for the right to 
	dissent, and the right to civic liberties which denote and designate a 
	modern state from which Bangladesh seems irretrievably skidding away.<br>
	<br>
	****<br>
	<br>
	From <i>Amar Natun Janmo</i> (My New Birth):<br>
	<br>
	The novel for which I have been killed -- I have survived this death -- is
	<b>Pak Sar Zameen Saad Baad; </b>this is an<b> </b>artistic representation 
	of Bangladesh situation. (Its end). . . from the ocean and its green arose a 
	red sun. This is a symbolic idea, that Bangladesh will not be overwhelmed by 
	fundamentalism, Bangladesh will not be overpowered by fundamentalist 
	assassins, Bangladesh will never become Afghanistan.<br>
	<br>
	I recall that our intellectuals, poets, novelists, essayists, and teachers 
	were assassinated in a planned manner on 14 Dec. 1971, and the very Razakars 
	and Al Badar who had participated in those assassinations had tried again to 
	kill me according to a plan in independent Bangladesh. Probably in this 
	independent Bangladesh I am the first well targeted victim of the 
	reactionary Razakar and Al Badr.<br>
	<br>
	I will survive in my own country, in Bangladesh, and I want a Bangladesh 
	which is free of Al Badr , free of Razakar, free of fundamentalists. I will 
	urge the presidents of two major political parties to uproot fundamentalism 
	from Bangladesh. . . Under the false cover of religion, all these killers 
	who were directly associated with 1971 mass murders - are propagating 
	fundamentalism -- they are spreading Talibani ideas -- they want to kill and 
	destroy the mind and talent -- they want the nation to regress to Medieval 
	Age...Propagating fundamentalist politics via the most modern process, the 
	medium of the TV -- this must be stopped. . . If my restoration to life 
	bears any purpose that would <br>
	be to eradicate fundamentalism from Bangladesh totally. . .<br>
	<br>
	These fundamentalist forces -- ministers, MPs -- are unable to understand 
	any book of mine -- not even <b>Pak Sar Zameen Saad Baad</b>. They 
	understand where their interests were dented -- in this book I have candidly 
	presented their ruthlessness, their life stories --<br>
	it has been done so nowhere else. . .Inside they are terribly uneducated 
	idiots, hypocrites and barbaric medievalists, and all of them are assassins. 
	Our nation is at present swarming with assassins. . . (After my death) 
	within a month and a half, at least 2000 people have been murdered, 2000 to 
	4000 women have been raped; from this state dispensation it is necessary to 
	redeem this rotten, diseased, and bloody nation. . .<br>
	<br>
	I think that when Saudi Nizami Golam Azam will be writhing in his grave, 
	when various kinds of pythons coiling around him would be pulverizing him, 
	when their graves will be ablaze inside, Bangladesh will keep my name in its 
	memory. It would not be very easy to wipe off my name very easily; but the 
	names of these Saudis and Nizamis will be erased in a very short time as of 
	dirty men and killers. Nobody will utter their names.<br>
	<br>
	I will write, writing is my life, writing is my delight, and all the 
	progressivism, of which I speak and write, contains human freedom, freedom 
	of Bangladesh, human well-being, right to individual freedom, and always my 
	aim is to create art against the despots.<br>
	<br>
	I never consider my work accomplished; and one more thing, I never want on 
	bended knees to get anything from the politicians who have taken over the 
	nation.<br>
	<br>
	I want a healthy, welfare-oriented Bangladesh, and this is the 
	responsibility of the politicians -- but the politicians have become so 
	rotten and nasty that they have no ideals, no integrity, no love for the 
	nation, they are only hoarding illicit money, and nurturing quite a few 
	killers, that is why Bangladesh is in such a sorry state. In the world at 
	present, Bangladesh is very ill reputed, repeatedly ranked first in 
	corruption. Many are of the opinion that Bangladesh is the world's scandal, 
	Asia's shame. . . the same bloody, ravaged and decadent Bangladesh I want to 
	live in, I want to go back to.<br>
	<br>

	<i>Amar Prothom Boee (My First Book</i>)<br>
	<br>
	I had written a poem under this title (Supernatural Steamer). Childhood's 
	(experience of) the sound of siren from the steamers on Padma, its look from 
	a distance, as if from the other shore of the universe, a supernatural 
	steamer emerging into view -- this picture constantly moves in my inner 
	being. In my mind's Padma, a magic steamer has always been afloat. I named 
	the book after that poem.<br>
	...as if the cargo of sadness, like friends, would alight in my heart.<br>
	<br>
	Poetry is worldly, but the mystery of creativity is ethereal.<br>
	<br>
	****<br>
	<i>Ami (I) <br>
	<br>
	</i>. . .I want to survive. At least for forty years. Because I have been 
	unable so far to make meaningful and purposeful this beautiful, 
	incomparable, meaningless, purposeless life<br>
	according to my dream. For that are needed several thousand years . . .<br>
	<br>

	<i>Manavadhikar o Lekhoker Swadhinata</i>: <i>Prekshit Bangladesh (Human 
	Rights and Writer's Freedom: Perspective Bangladesh).<br>
	<br>
	</i>The scriptures try to perpetuate human inequality because their authors 
	believed in inequality. They never thought of any radical social change.<br>
	<br>
	I think the Bangla literature until 1950s is Muslims' Bangla literature and 
	the literature of 1960s is the literature of Bengalis' Bangla literature. . 
	. From the very beginning, the people of Bangladesh faced lack of human 
	rights. . . Human rights in Bangladesh remain inscribed in certain 
	documents. In real terms there are no human rights here.<br>
	<br>
	The society we live in is a kind of monarchy even though we keep calling it 
	a democracy.<br>
	. . .we know that the person who is our Prime Minister is the real king; our 
	cabinet of ministers is the king's council. They want to enjoy all the 
	rights of the state. For this they want to pocket all the wealth of the 
	nation and fill their houses with. All of them wield power down to the 
	sub-inspector of a police station. . .Here ordinary human being has no 
	rights.<br>
	<br>
	. . .If our MPs think that on the basis of two-thirds vote today they would 
	pass a law that MPs would remain alive for ever and rule Bangladesh forever, 
	they can do so. No matter if it is not possible for them to stay alive 
	eternally. But they certainly can pass such a law. Nature, though, would not 
	abide by their law. That until now they did not legislate so is quite 
	surprising. . .Meantime it has been decided that they cannot be accused of 
	any charge. But members of opposition will be arrested right away. . . The 
	heart of Bangladesh beats in Dhaka University. Best teachers of Bangladesh 
	teach there. At present they themselves feel apprehensive in speaking. They 
	are afraid of students. . ..Because a few of these students are 
	power-wielders. . . The conditions in Bangladesh warrant that it be called a 
	barbaric nation. . .Here ordinary human beings are totally helpless. <br>
	<br>
	At present in Bangladesh,we are under intimidation and muscle power. . .In 
	childhood I had read in Bangla grammar the story of an extraordinary 
	character, Gopal. He ate only banana, nothing else. Our Susheel Samaj (civil 
	society) too keeps eating only banana. . .it is dead deaf. By saying Susheel 
	Samaj we understand a weak person, terrorized and afraid. He wears well 
	ironed clothes, oils his head abundantly, and parts his hair in the middle. 
	. . In fact, we need Asheel Samaj (uncivil society). The Asheel Samaj which 
	has always transformed the society. . . I like to propose the Bangla word 
	Jan Samaj (mass of people). All civil society is not civil. . . For 
	establishing its rights, long has it had to be uncivil. For without becoming 
	uncivil no society can become transformed. . .<br>
	<br>
	There is no human right in Bangladesh. Whatever rights the United Nations 
	may give us, whatever rights may be (guaranteed) in our Constitution, all 
	that does not materialize in our lives. Our lives are bereft of rights, and 
	are subjugated by the powerful. At present our lives are stalked all the 
	while by assailants, terrorists, and assassins. This life is not a life 
	invested with human rights. . .Our women are tortured at home, a large 
	number of poor women are terrorized from the fear of rape. . .<br>
	<br>
	At present we live in Banglastan, which is even worse than East Pakistan. In 
	it nobody's right is recognized. Who is here who can forcefully say that he 
	would be able to stroll or hitch hike in Bangladesh all by himself? He can 
	be assaulted by the police. He can be rushed by a terrorist . . . perhaps 
	waylaid by a fundamentalist. . . There are two zones of lack of rights in 
	Bangladesh -- Fundamentalist and Nationalist. A despot established 
	nationalism in Bangladesh. All of you know that Zia Islamized the 
	constitution of Bangladesh. Thereafter an evil man like Ershad established 
	nationalism. . .No democratic government wielding power, after him, 
	repudiated nationalism. They too became committed to nationalism. It is this 
	nationalism which has made a majority of people in Bangladesh bereft of 
	rights. Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and Chakmas living<br>
	in the hilly areas -- all of them are deprived of rights. When a nation 
	makes one<br>
	religion prime, the implication is that the followers of other religions 
	will have to be exterminated. Like Saudi Arabia, and now Afghanistan. In 
	various Muslim countries this dispensation is well in effect. . .All 
	different religions have been uprooted in Saudi Arabia. There is no place of 
	worship of any other religion there. In fact, there is no constitution 
	there. When Abdul Aziz established the Saudi nation by deceit and with lies, 
	his cohorts were fundamentalists. . . Man there has not an iota of right. . 
	.the kings have strengthened their power by flaunting religion, made their 
	atrocities acceptable, and rendered their despotism divine.<br>
	<br>
	Afghanistan's fundamentalism has infiltrated Bangladesh. In Bangladesh<br>
	fundamentalism now is a daily affair. . .They (the jobless youth) are 
	surrendering to the easy money coming from the Middle East. Religion has 
	built for them two<br>
	establishments -- mosque and madrasa. . .Muslim extremists have turned 
	mosques into their strongholds of power. . .There the police is barred 
	entry. In our country at present, mosque- and- madrasa-based fundamentalism 
	is getting entrenched. Fundamentalism is murder, robbery of others' rights. 
	They are being persuaded that if they kill they would go to paradise. Kill 
	the enemy. . . In the country as the criminals and black marketers grow in 
	numbers so do madrasas. . . Fundamentalism is uprooting now all the rights 
	of man. It wants to destroy the wholesome, natural human being. . .In this 
	situation, everyone bears immense responsibility. . .Just processions, or 
	opinion pieces in newspapers will not avail any more. We will have to go to 
	every mosque to see whether religion is being taught or wielding firearms. 
	From the happenings around us, from the way fundamentalists' violent 
	barbarism is spreading, from the way people are being<br>
	killed, it would seem that all these are jumping out straight from the pages 
	of my novel<br>
	<b>Pak Sar Zameen Saad Baad</b>. Its characters are becoming real.<br>
	<br>
	(Translation of excerpts from <b>Amar Natun Janmo</b> mine. IKS.)<br>
	<br>
	****<br>
	<br>
	A quote from my article <i>Dhaka Bans Humayun Azad's Nari</i>, Mainstream, 
	New Delhi, 16 March 1996, p.35:<br>
	It is not material whether the writer chosen for persecution is eminent or a 
	novice, whether his work -- creative or critical -- is great or ordinary. It 
	is the writers' and artists' prerogative to claim autonomy of domain, to 
	assert their self-determination in regard to their craft. That is their 
	province. No trespass on this territory can be tolerated, no transgression 
	against this basic human morality forgiven -- let the message ring loud and 
	clear, in Dhaka and elsewhere.<br>
	<br>
	That the electoral politics in Bangladesh has its own logic need not be 
	elaborated. The wobbly state has gone on tilting towards fundamentalism 
	incrementally. But the ban on <b><i>Nari</i></b><i>,</i> calculated to 
	garner fanatics' votes and thus extend the life of this regime, is a wrong 
	signal. It may boomerang. It may encourage and vindicate enemies of the 
	state and traitors of the nation. A regime strengthens itself not by 
	abridging but by extending human rights, by enlarging the scope of creative 
	energies and constructive projects. Anything to the contrary brings demise, 
	besides others', its own.<br>
	<br>
	<i>[ I have written <b>Nari</b> to have the patriarchal proscriptions over a 
	large segment of humanity withdrawn, for giving woman her human rights; for 
	demolishing all the traditions of our dark region. Woman in this region is 
	destitute; whatever small rights of hers were conceded over a few centuries 
	are in danger of being rescinded. Today reaction is strong all around. Its 
	first victim is woman. . .In Bangladesh woman did not get freedom, still the 
	campaign to shackle her hard is on. Every institution is working against 
	woman; there are medieval fundamentalists who are committed enemies of 
	woman. Even the progressives of our region are traditional, among them too 
	the old prejudices are alive; they too behave like the fundamentalists when 
	they hear about feminism. Their progressivism is the progressivism of 
	establishing male dominance with the woman banished. This book is a 
	repudiation of tradition and patriarchal civilization. I want total equality 
	of men and women.<br>

	Two letters of Azad.<br>
	<br>
	From: Dr Humayun Azad 11 January 1996<br>
	Professor and Chairman: Department of Bengali<br>
	University of Dhaka: Dhaka 1000<br>
	Bangladesh <i><br>
	</i>To: Professor I K Shukla<br>
	552 W 12th, San Pedro, CA 90731, USA.<br>
	<br>
	Dear Professor Shukla,<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Thank you very much for your letter, which gave me much pleasure. The 
	Government of Bangladesh banned my book <i>Nari</i> on 19 November 1995. A 
	handout says 'the book hurt the religious sentiments of the Muslims and 
	contains materials against fundamental beliefs in Islam.' The Government 
	informed neither me nor my publisher about this ban, I came to know about 
	the ban through newspapers. The grounds for banning the book are totally 
	false. The party in power in Bangladesh is becoming more and more 
	fundamentalist. The national election will be held soon. The Government 
	banned my book with the hope that the fanatics will be happy and vote for 
	them.<br>
	I shall be really happy if you could arrange to translate and publish it in 
	Hindi and English. I am especially interested in Hindi and other Indian 
	languages. I would like to send you a copy of the book, but it is difficult 
	now. The book is available in the USA. Could you please contact Mr Bishvajit 
	Shaha to the following addresses: Prabashi, New York, Fax 212 808 4469 or 
	Muktadhara, 39-25, 65th Street, Apartment 2E, Woodside, New York 11377, Fax 
	and Tel 718-458-3616. Mr Shaha will supply you a book. I have got an 
	invitation to visit New York which may take place in the last week of 
	February 1996. If I go I would certainly like to meet you.<br>
	Could you please inform the Feminist and Human Rights Organizations of the 
	USA about the ban?<br>
	Here is some information about the book and ban below:<br>
	<b>On the book</b> : <i>Nari,</i> <i>Woman,</i> is the first full-length 
	feminist research work in Bengali on the condition of women. The book 
	(published by <i>Agami Prakashani,</i> <i>36 Banglabazar, Dhaka</i>) 
	contains 406 pages. It was first serialized in two weeklies in 1991, and was 
	published in book form in 1992. Three editions and eight reprints of the 
	book have been published so far. The book enjoyed immense popularity, and 
	has become a modern classic. The book borrowed feminist theories from the 
	West in order to analyse the condition of women. It also contains chapters 
	on Rammohan, Bidyashagar, Rokeya who first wanted to liberate Bengali women 
	from bondage, and it also contains chapters on feminist criticism and the 
	novels written by Bengali women novelists. It is the most popular 
	dissertation ever written in Bengali.<br>
	<b>About the author </b>: Dr Humayun Azad (born 1947) is a major Bengali 
	poet, critic, linguist, and novelist, who has a PhD in Linguistics from 
	Edinburgh (1976). He is professor and chairman of the Department of Bengali, 
	University of Dhaka. He has published 35 books (poetry, criticism, essays, 
	linguistics, novels) so far, and won many prizes including the prestigious 
	Bengali Academy Prize. He is considered the most modern and most 
	anti-traditional writer in Bangladesh.<br>
	<b>Reactions against the ban </b>: The Dailies and weeklies of Bangladesh 
	reacted sharply against this ban. On the first day after the ban (21 Nov 
	1995) the daily newspapers gave huge publicity of the ban, published 
	comments of the author, and a daily, <i>Banglabazar Patrika</i>, made it the 
	second lead news. Radio BBC transmitted the news several times in English 
	(including a telephone interview with the author) and Bengali. The <i>Daily 
	Star</i> published an editorial 'A foolish ban', and <i>Sangbad</i> 
	published one captioned <i>Nari : Woman</i>. A group of protesters arranged 
	a seminar on 'Scholarship, Creativity and the Rights of a Writer'. News of 
	the protests against the ban is being published everyday.<br>
	I have filed a writ petition against the ban in the Highcourt on 3 December 
	1995. Barrister Amirul Islam is my lawyer. The Highcourt has served a 
	Showcause notice on the Govt. Thanking you.<br>

	Dear Prof. Shukla,<br>
	I received 3 letters from you within a short period of time, but I am sorry 
	that I could not reply as we were in violent non-cooperation movement that 
	brought the downfall of the reactionary BNP government. I always kook 
	forward to hearing from you, because all your aerograms and envelopes bring 
	some happiness for me. I could never dream that anybody in the universe 
	would write an article like Dhaka Bans. I shall remain grateful to you for 
	what you are doing for me.<br>
	I feel so happy when I think you have read my book, and it gives me much 
	pleasure that you have liked it. I have written a lot, about ten thousand 
	pages in Bengali. Now I am working on a new novel. The hero of the novel is 
	an Indian prophet who disowns his own holy book and is murdered by his 
	followers.<br>
	My visit to New York did not take place, although VOA said that I visited 
	New York in Feb. 1996. If I go the USA, I shall certainly contact you.<br>
	The books and journals you mentioned in your letter are not available in 
	Bangladesh.<br>
	I would like to see <b>NARI</b> translated in English, Hindi, and in other 
	Indian languages. No publisher has yet approached me. I would suggest you to 
	find some publishers who can publish the book in translation.<br>
	<br>
	With regards. Yours sincerely,<br>
	6.4.1996 Humayun Azad <br>

	Which magic steamer did you board<br>
	And sadly, suddenly sail away<br>
	To horizons unknown<br>
	Depriving us of the golden hoard<br>
	Of vibrant poems and venerable books?<br>
	<br>
	Padma would always keep wondering<br>
	In ceaseless moan.<br>
