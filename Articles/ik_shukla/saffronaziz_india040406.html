	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">L.K.Advani and Rajnath Singh, 
	respectively the previous and present presidents of BJP, will launch their 
	saffron-swamped March on India at the end of first week of April, 2006, in 
	imitation of Mussolini’s Black Shirts’ March on Rome of 1922. Whereas 
	saffron may lend putatively a native touch, the deference to Il Duce remains 
	religiously enshrined in the Black Caps of RSS. (B. S. Moonje, the 
	father-figure of Hindu fascism, had visited him in 1930). The Black Cap 
	corps of Hindu fascists stubbornly commemorates its anti-India, anti-Gandhi 
	stance in repudiating and rejecting the white, homespun, Gandhi cap, the 
	headgear designed by the Mahatma to signify independence from the British 
	modes of colonial couture. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Marches were the stock-in-trade 
	political ploys of Italian fascists and Nazi hordes comprising terror and 
	mobsterism. This gangster tactics of intimidation and violence has been 
	routinely used by, and proved destructively advantageous to, the Hindu 
	fascists. Since there is semantically nothing it can be honestly sheathed 
	in, the Vedic Taliban have christened such anti-religious, anti-social, and 
	anti-national stalking as Yatra. Just as Hindutva, a criminal cult of 
	power-hungry status quoists, has nothing in the least to do with Hinduism, 
	so these violence-oozing marches have nothing in common with Yatra. This is 
	only of the several markers of Hinduism that the saffronazis have pillaged 
	and prostituted. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Advani thinks he can retrieve his 
	lost eminence and usefulness in the Hindutva band wagon by communal 
	polarization among voters via communal riots, as in his earlier Blood Yatras, 
	which yielded spectacular electoral gains. He fantasizes that this way he 
	would not only ramp up his sagging political fortune, but also staunch the 
	hemorrhaging of BJP and stop its vote bank shrinkage. Rajnath thinks he has 
	no way else other than this tried and tested, even if time-worn, gambit to 
	establish himself as a leader in his own right, without the stilts of 
	patrons and party public relations. He likes to believe he can, and must be 
	seen he can, help BJP in UP to revive and surge. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Uma Bharati is only one, though 
	significant, of many factors impelling these twin marches. Either she can be 
	repudiated and cut down to size; or, she can be roped in, after a formal 
	show of contrition, to go stump for the BJP before she can be taken back. Is 
	this conjecture unrealistic? Not, if we notice how Um Bharati has repeatedly 
	gone on changing the dates of announcement for her incubating new party.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is another factor, though 
	belatedly so apparent, why these fascist Hindu marchers feel so comfy. 
	Congress complicity. Covertly, it has been made foolproof. Congress did 
	nothing to protect its own people, let alone the Muslims, massacred in 
	Gujarat 2002, or the Christians murdered ever since in an unbroken series in 
	many BJP-run states. BJP is emboldened and feels endorsed. Ehsan Jaffri, 
	Congress MP, along with others, was burnt and hacked into pieces, for the 
	crime of having contested against Modi in the elections. And, several 
	Congress MLAs and other office bearers of Gujarat Congress were among the 
	killers and rapists and robbers of Gujarat Genocide of Muslims in 2002. As 
	if this comradeship between Congress and BJP were not enough, Congress 
	helped BJP by letting go scot-free the Hindutva criminals involved in the 
	Babri Mosque demolition. It found no time, despite repeated reminders, to 
	file answers before the Liberhan Commission enquiring into the criminally 
	engineered Babri Demolition! And, too, Congress at the centre is damn sure, 
	it can count on BJP support to continue in power, avoiding mid-term 
	election, were the Left to withdraw from the UPA government in disgust at 
	and protest against its retrograde and repressive anti-national policies. 
	Without these sordid and sub rosa factors, BJP would not have had the 
	effrontery to demand security from government for its blood-and-fire fascist 
	marches from Rajkot (Gujarat) and Puri (Orissa), the former the paradigm of 
	Hindu Rashtra, cleansed of minorities, under one-party rule in perpetuity; 
	and the latter to be made now the fiery vale of bloody tears and the domain 
	of rampant saffron terrorism, and regnant swastika tyranny. Ruling class 
	solidarity trumping all. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The ruling class solidarity 
	manifests itself in ways more than one. No functionaing democracy would have 
	suffered Thackeray, Togadia, Singhal, Katiyar, Advani, Joshi, Um Bharati 
	enjoying impunity and trashing law. Had any member of minority escaped the 
	dragnet or the dungeon with far less subversive activities and seditious 
	statements? This is how democracy is always unhinged, and rendered into a 
	joke, by the rulers. Even when most busy with these depredations, they, the 
	ruling hegemons, cry loudest about democracy and constitutional norms, 
	sanctity of parliament, and all that gibberish, the simony-infested media 
	cooing and echoing these pieties. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is national security that would 
	be grievously threatened with appeasement of this monster, as before. It is 
	communal divide that is to be fomented through the Bloody March (revisit 
	Suma Josson’s film Bombay’s Blood Yatra for the reality check). BJP, 
	dislodged from power, but having tasted blood – crimes and swindles galore 
	as power-dividends – that is desperate to rehabilitate itself. Congress is 
	helping it by instructing various state governments to provide protection.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When did Congress ever demand or 
	provide such protection for any other political party’s march? Is Congress 
	not only disoriented, but also demented? The state guaranteeing protection 
	to communal outlaws, fascist criminals, fierce stalkers, degenerate death 
	merchants, anti-social hoods and anti-national gangsters? Did Congress ever 
	issue any such advice to protect Muslims, Christians, Dalits, and Adivasis 
	to the terrorist state governments run by the BJP and its cohorts? Why did 
	it choose to appease the errant governments of so many states seething with 
	discontent under the saffronazi enemies of humanity, and inveterate, 
	implacable wreckers of the nation? Will playing deaf and dumb by Sonias and 
	Man Mohan Singhs be of any comfort to the harried masses? Will this 
	masquerade of the cynically mute avail? Will it avert the disaster looming 
	on the horizon of state after state where the wheels of this death chariot 
	would crunch out hatred and violence, death and devastation, fragmentation 
	and flight? Has appeasing the criminals in history ever paid? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These are the questions that people 
	at large and across the nation and beyond would be asking in anguish and 
	anger ever more importunately. </font></p>
