  <font size="2">
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </font>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">To: All interested parties</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Recent Developments in Bangladesh</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">In recent months, a number of reputed
  scholars, writers, teachers, columnists, intellectuals, diplomats and
  politicians have either been murdered or attacked in Bangladesh in addition to
  attacks on their cultural, religious and social events and destruction of
  heritage. Apparently, they are the victims of 'target killing'. Anyone who
  writes against Islamic fundamentalist view points, critical of Jehadis and
  argues against social injustice and religious intolerance are being
  systematically murdered or attacked. Such barbaric acts started with the
  murder of Principal (President) Gopal Krishna Muhuri of Chittagong followed by
  attacks on Dr. Muntasir Mamun, a reputed author/columnist and a Professor of
  the Dhaka University, Shahriar Kabir and Saleem Samad, reputed journalists,
  followed by murder of Dr. Humayun Azad, a noted author and a professor of the
  Dhaka University. Most recent victim is SM G Kibria and </font><font size="3" face="Verdana">Dr.
  M. Yunus.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Mr. Kibria is a pride of Bangladesh nation.
  He was not only a successful Finance Minister of Bangladesh he was also the
  Bangladesh Representative to the UN and was formerly the Under Secretary
  General of the UNO [Secretary General of ESCAFE]. Unfortunately, the
  government failed to arrest any of the killers yet.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Dr. M. Yunus was&nbsp; a respected professor
  of the Rajshahi University. He was also the Vice President of the Bangladesh
  Economic Association, a professional organization. It is more disturbing that
  when the University authority lodged a compliant with the local police, six
  faculty and academic administrators, including the Pro-Vice Chancellor
  (Executive Vice President) of the University have been threatened and warned
  not to pursue the murder case. Furthermore, the Bangladesh government
  reportedly reassigned the Investigating Police Officer.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Just earlier this month, when the Bengal
  Studies Conference (BSC) was scheduled to be held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for
  the first time in its 40 years of history, the participants received 'death
  threats' and were warned to stay away from participating in the conference.
  The BSC is a professional organization of Americans of Bengali origin. Many
  other Americans those who have interest in Bengali culture, heritage, history,
  economy, social and political studies also belong to this organization.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">The Center for Research and Information (CRI),
  an institute that collects information on socioeconomic issues and publishes
  research documents/books has been closed down by the Government. The
  Bangladesh Government seized its research materials, documents, database and
  computers. Although the highest Court in Bangladesh has accepted a motion on
  behalf of the CRI to reopen the center, the judges are yet to make a decision
  on the motion. A few judges have expressed that they are 'troubled' [bivrotho].
  As a result, CRI is now virtually closed for the unforeseeable future.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Background</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Under the policy of appeasement, this is what
  the Nazis did in Germany before and during World War II and so did the
  totalitarian governments including that of Iraq and Afghanistan. The Talibans
  proudly destroyed the century-old Buddhists heritage and forbidden its girls
  to attend schools or sports.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">The grim memory of the genocide committed by
  occupying Pakistani soldiers and their local collaborators in 1971 still
  horrifies many in Bangladesh. Like the Nazi Germany, the genocide of Bengalis
  was preceded by repeated attacks against their cultural heritage. The attacks
  against the Bangla language, its culture including killings of Bengali
  intellectuals in 1971, were all designed to substitute a thousand-year old
  rich and secular Bengali culture with certain fundamentalist principles.
  Fortunately, the creation of an independent Bangladesh has forever changed the
  dynamics of that plan. On the other hand, members and supporters of
  fundamentalist groups that opposed the creation of secular Bangladesh are
  becoming more and more politically active; and in recent years have started
  once again launching violent attacks against intellectuals including, poets,
  writers, newspaper columnist, and educators. They also destroyed and attacked
  many religious institutions; churches, pagodas, mandirs, temples and Ahmedia
  mosques belonging to different beliefs and faith. In addition, Bangladeshi
  girls and women have forcibly been denied participating in out door games
  including Olympic swimming and football competitions.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">In the recent months, attempts were made on
  the life of former Bangladesh Prime Minister and the current leader of the
  Opposition Parties, Sheikh Hasina at a public rally in which 21 were killed
  including the President of her women wing and nearly 300 were wounded.
  Attempts were made on the life of a number of veteran and well respected
  moderate politicians like former President of Bangladesh, Dr. AQM B. Chowdhury,
  former Foreign Minister and internationally known jurist, Dr. Kamal Hussain,
  former Prime Minister’s Political Adviser and Minority Leader, Suranjit Sen
  Gupta, former Planning Minister, Dr. M. Khan Alamgir, former MP, Ms.
  Zebunnessa, plus on hundreds of public representatives and journalists. Highly
  respected members of parliament and opposition party leaders like SM G Kibria,
  MP, Ahsnaullah Master, MP, Monzurul Ahsan, Ms. Ivy Rahman, MP, et al have been
  assassinated at public rally.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">The Bangladesh Bar Council Human Rights Cell
  reports that there had been a total of 45,396 cases of human rights violations
  in Bangladesh in 2004 [which is double of 2003] including 5,113 murders, 814
  rapes and 348 extra-judicial deaths under security/police custody.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">In fact, once again security of life,
  liberty, research, scholarship and freedom of choice and opinion is at stake
  in Bangladesh. Like 1971, target killing is being used by the Islamic
  fundamentalist as a strategy to silence intellectual freedom and scholarship.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Following Dr. Zbigniew Brzesinski or Nobel
  Laureates Milton Freidman, Hans Bethe, Insidor Rabi, Harold Urey, or Eugene
  Wigner, we would like to state that 'although our governments may remain
  silent, we, as scholars and teachers, cannot’. It remains our duty to the
  fallen colleagues to express our sense of horror and we call upon our
  respective governments and lawmakers to express their horror at this
  systematic extermination of scholars.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>The Resolution</b></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">On January 17, 2005, a meeting of concerned
  people of Bangladeshi origin was held at MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.A.
  The meeting adopted the following resolutions:</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">(1) We call upon our respective governments
  and lawmakers to express their horror at this systematic killing of scholars.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">(2) We urge the Bangladesh government to take
  necessary measures to punish the culprits and their associates. The government
  should also take effective steps to stop any further target killing and
  desecration of religious and social heritage.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">(3) We request the U. S. and other
  governments and their lawmakers as well as respective international
  organizations to take appropriate actions deemed necessary to stop such target
  killing and attacks.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">[If you are outraged at such systematic
  killing and attacks, and destruction of heritage and freedom of choice, please
  put your signature, name, affiliation, city, state, country and send it to
  respective governments/ international organizations and to your public
  representative and local media to end such extermination.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Verdana">Thank you].</font><font size="3" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
