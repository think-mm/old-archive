		<font face="Verdana" size="3"><ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>, a moderate Muslim 
		country is fast becoming a terrorist hub under the leadership of 
		Khaleda-Nizami coalition government. In the last one month, a number of 
		terrorist groups killed judges and lawyers as they were not practicing 
		the Islamic Sharia Laws. These groups on <ST1>August 17, 2005</ST1> 
		exploded nearly 493 bombs across the nation to commemorate their 
		successful bomb blasts of <ST1>August 21, 2004</ST1> that they directed 
		at the Public Rally of Sheikh Hasina, the leader of the largest 
		political party of the country, the Awami League (AL) in which 23 killed 
		and over 350 were wounded.&nbsp; Earlier they killed and assassinated a 
		number of top AL leaders including former Finance Minister Shah AMS 
		Kibria, Ahsanullah Master, MP, a number of progressive writers, authors, 
		university professors and journalists that opposed ‘rise of militancy 
		and extremism’. &nbsp;The total death toll due to bomb blasts alone is over 
		158 now and total death toll due to torture and extra-judicial killing 
		by the government forces and the terrorists is over 1,000 lives. In all 
		those occasions, instead of arresting the culprits and the terrorists, 
		the government routinely blamed the Opposition party, the journalists 
		and the nation’s intellectuals and arrested nearly a million innocent 
		people It also arrested columnists, journalists, and human rights 
		activists that voice opinion against such futile ‘coverage’ and their 
		inactivity. For example, when bomb exploded at a movie theatre in 
		Mymensingh, instead of arresting the culprits, the Khaleda government 
		arrested a 70-year old highly respected Opposition leader, a lawyer by 
		profession plus Dr. Muntasir Mamun, a reputed professor and columnist 
		and Saber Hussain Chowdhury, a highly successful businessman, formerly a 
		Minister. In fact, the wrath of the government fell on journalists and 
		columnists and they were falsely termed as the ‘enemies of the country’ 
		and ‘paid employees of RAW’, the Indian Intelligence forces, as per the 
		government PR campaign, for disgracing the image of the nation by 
		exposing the danger and evils of target killing, fascism, violence and 
		rising terrorism and for calling the government to take action against 
		terrorists. The government not only arrested journalists and columnist, 
		they mercilessly tortured them, and many had to leave the country and 
		solicit asylum abroad. The government filed cases of treason against 
		them. Unfortunately, all the time Prime Minister Zia and her stooges 
		either out-rightly denied the existence of terrorists, blamed her 
		Opposition, or claimed those as media-created. More painful is that they 
		always misdirected the investigation. The police officers that unearth 
		the linkage of Jamathi Islam party to terrorism, a coalition partner of 
		the government, were summarily withdrawn from the investigation. No 
		wonder, Ms. Asma Kibria, wife of assassinated editor and leader, Mr. 
		Shah Kibria and her family demanded a FBI investigation as they have no 
		faith and confidence in the government. When 16 U. S. Lawmakers 
		including Senators Kennedy, Kerry, Sununu, Chafee, DeWine and others 
		demanded an expeditious independent investigation, the <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
		government instead of independent investigation went on a massive PR 
		campaign and questioned the validity of such a letter and their 
		integrity. It also replaced all the officials that are linked to 
		investigation with die-hard party supporters. For example, the 
		investigation officer was replaced by a close associate of the son of 
		the Prime Minister, the Deputy Commissioner, the executive head of the 
		district where murder took place has been replaced by an officer of the 
		Prime Minister’s secretariat basically to ensure water-tight control to 
		avoid leakage of findings linking the government leaders. No wonder such 
		action compelled many Bangladeshis including Kibria’s family to demand 
		international investigation under the UN/FBI Supervision as they did in 
		the case of murder of the former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Harari.&nbsp;

		<font face="Verdana" size="3">However, since August 17 bomb blasts, more 
		than 100 suspected terrorists have been arrested. Although many 
		attackers gave vivid testimony linking the JI leadership, Prime Minister 
		and her associates claimed that the JI is not involved with terrorism. 
		Question is; can government continue to cover up and shelter the 
		terrorists and their master mind? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana" size="3">In October 2001, the current government 
		came into power with two-third majority through a debatable election and 
		since then, the rise of Islamic militancy took a sharp turn.&nbsp; A senior 
		member of the ruling coalition, Abu Hena, MP, recently alleged that a 
		number of Minister and a dozen of top leaders of the coalition 
		government have been directly involved in sheltering the terrorists. He 
		further alleged that the Prime Minister Khaleda Zia knew about them. The 
		government instead of launching any inquiry on his allegations 
		immediately terminated him from the party membership. It also reminded 
		its other party members that such disloyalty would be dealt with 
		severely. In case of Dr. AQM B. Chowdhury, former President of the 
		coalition government and other BNP MPs like Mahi Chowdhury and Col 
		(Retd) Mannan that voiced opinion against the government’s cover ups and 
		mismanagement faced quick termination and beating publicly at the hands

		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="3">The Bangladeshi dailies have been 
		publishing reports linking the Jamathi Islam party (JI) as the main 
		master-mind of terrorism in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>. This party has the 
		financial resource, dedicated membership, relevant literature, committed 
		ideology and mind set and also capability to launch Jehadi movements. 
		Secondly, the members of its youth wing, the Islami Chatra Shibir, ICS 
		(earlier Ishami Chatra Songo or Tulabay-e-Islam) have been found to be 
		involved in many explosions, murders and assassinations. Although a 
		large number of their followers come from Madrassa, nevertheless their 
		leaders belong to major universities. The <ST1>Chittagong</ST1> and the <ST1>
		Rajshahi Universities</ST1> are mostly overtaken by them. Many of them 
		are very smart, fully brainwashed and highly committed. For example, one 
		suicide bomber who miraculously survived Gazipur bomb blast, as per 
		media report, stated that he would prefer death and become a ‘Jehadi 
		martyr’ so as to receive 70 virgins as his companions after his death. 
		Another one, a Madrassa student whose right hand is crippled due to bomb 
		explosion refused taking even water with his ‘left hand’ as ‘eating food 
		only with his right hand’ as per his teaching would lead him to heaven. 
		They are so much committed and brainwashed!! No wonder they could kill 
		point blank Principal Muhuri, a veteran Hindu educationist. No wonder 
		they could kill Dr. Mohammed Yunus or could chopped the neck of Dr. 
		Humayun Azad, renowned educationists that opposed extremism. &nbsp;In fact, 
		most of the terrorists that have been arrested in Bangladesh so far 
		belong to JI or ICS. Third, the three militant organizations of <ST1>
		Bangladesh----</ST1> the Jamatual Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), the 
		Jagrotho Muslim Janatha (JMJ) and the Hujjatul Mujahideen (HuJ) that 
		government declared as ‘terrorist organizations’ were led by JI party 
		members. For example, the leader of the JMB Maulana Abdur Rahman Ibne 
		Abdullah alias Sheikh Abdur Rahman is a son of die-hard JI activist who 
		was a member of the notorious Al-Badr in 1971 [Al-Badr killed many 
		Bengali progressive intellectuals in 1971]. Sheikh Rahman was a member 
		of ICS when he was a student and then joined JI. Afterwards, he went to <ST1>
		Afghanistan</ST1> and on his return formed the JMB. The notorious 
		terrorist, Bangla Bhai alias Siddiqul Islam that murdered more than 20 
		in ‘execution style’ was a strong JI activist. He was working at the 
		Saudi Embassy in <ST1>Dhaka</ST1> as a local recruit and then went to <ST1>
		Afghanistan</ST1>. On his return, initially he formed the ‘Al-Qaeda of <ST1>
		Bangladesh</ST1>’ and then changed its name to ‘Muslim Rokka Mujahideen 
		Okko Porishad’. Recently, he again renamed his organization as the 
		‘Jagrotho Muslim Janatha’ (JMJ). The leader of the HuJ Maulana Fazlur 
		Rahman signed an Al-Qaeda official declaration of 'holy war' in which 
		Osama Bin Laden, Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, Ayman Zahwari, Ahmed Taha and 
		Sheikh Hamzah, internationally known Jehadis also put their signatures. 
		The declaration proposes to destroy the evil empire of <ST1>USA</ST1> 
		and establish the Sharia law across nations [see Litner’s article]. 
		Nevertheless, the leader of the JI party, Maulana Motiur Rahman Nizami, 
		a Cabinet Minister of Bangladesh government claimed that all these 
		terrorists are no longer with his party although the JI never terminated 
		their membership. </font></p>

		<font face="Verdana" size="3">Why young men become suicide Jehadi?&nbsp; <O></O>
		</font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="3">There are many reasons why a young man 
		chooses the life of a Jehadi in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>. First, religious 
		indoctrination and brainwash. Second, poverty and hopelessness. Third, 
		feeling of injustice either due to foreign policy of big powers or 
		others. Fourth, polarization of wealth and fortune. The Bangladesh Human 
		Rights groups identified a total of 58 terrorist organizations in 
		Bangladesh and members of all these organizations, as per analysts, are 
		linked to JI party.&nbsp; One might wonder how come it is possible to form so 
		many terrorist organizations. Remember, <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> is a big 
		country in terms of population and if it becomes a hotbed of terrorists, 
		it would be difficult to contain it. It has a population of over 140 
		million and nearly half of them earn less than a $2 a day. Over 40% are 
		unemployed or under employed and youth unemployment is staggering.&nbsp; Many 
		young men who are little educated finding no hope, no job, no future and 
		staying at parent’s home watching their poverty morally and ethically 
		want to help them. How can they help? They have no job no money.&nbsp; 
		Therefore, if anyone approaches them with Taka 10 or 20 grants [nearly 
		$100-$200] they get hooked to it. More importantly, if they are told 
		that if they die, first they would go to haven leaving this miserable 
		life and secondly, their family would get Taka 1 lakh or 2 lakh (nearly 
		$1500) as compensation. How many unemployed youth for months can resist 
		such temptation? </font></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="3">Still the strength of <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
		economy is its rural and agricultural sector that employs the majority 
		and arranges their daily needs. Since Zia government came to power, 
		there has been a sharp decline in the growth of these sectors and 
		unemployment sharply increased. In addition, there is also a sharp 
		decline in both foreign and domestic investment causing further crisis 
		of employment opportunity. Finding no option over 3 million Bangladeshis 
		went abroad to work as ‘expatriate laborers’ at a personal high cost.&nbsp;

		terrorists, murderers and hoodlums become rich overnight. They enjoy the 
		modern comforts of life including close contacts with the power house, 
		the police, the Ministers and the like [Bangladeshi dailies published 
		photographs of terrorists with the nation’s Home Minister repeatedly]. 
		They overnight become friends to the coalition leaders that use them to 
		perform their evil designs. Third, these young men while watching global 
		media find that their life is worse than that of animals abroad and such 
		intensify their frustration further. In addition, the brainwashing of 
		having 70 virgins after death works as a catalyst to become suicide 
		bombers or terrorists.&nbsp; </font></p>

		<font face="Verdana" size="3">Why the Government Be Involved in 
		Terrorism? 
<O></O></font></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="3">Now question is why the ruling party or 
		the JI would be involved in ‘terrorism’ and ‘murder’. Both the JI and 
		the BNP parties’ main enemy is the <ST1>AL</ST1> party and they would 
		like its total elimination. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and her top 
		leadership repeatedly and publicly declared that the opposition <ST1>AL</ST1> 
		party would never be allowed to take power for the next 55 years [Daily 
		Star, Janakantha, Bhorer Kajog]. In order to achieve that goal, a number 
		of prominent leaders of the <ST1>AL</ST1> party have been assassinated. 
		Secondly, it has been observed that the nation’s lawyers, intellectuals, 
		journalists and human rights activists are strong supporters of ‘rule of 
		law’, ‘moderation’, and they are generally anti-JI. Since the opposition 
		AL party was critical of the government’s atrocities, cover-ups and 
		violation of rule of law through programs like the ‘Operation Clean 
		Heart’, ‘Rab’, ‘Chita’, ‘Bangla Bhai’ and such other extrajudicial 
		killing, these lawyers and human rights activists became the largest 
		group of supporters of the opposition platform. Third, the legal laws 
		and courts are an impediment to government’s totalitarianism, fascism 
		and rampant violation of laws. Therefore, the ruling coalition, the 
		BNP-JI, wanted to punish the AL and their supporters as they did in 
		2001. Immediately after their victory in 2001, the ruling hoodlums 
		punished, uprooted, raped and destroyed the minority people that are 
		known as the ‘vote bank’ of the <ST1>AL</ST1> party. In addition, the 
		goal of the JI and its affiliates are to replace nation’s legal system 
		based on English common laws by Sharia laws that were developed in the 7<sup>th</sup> 
		century by the then Islami scholars on the basis of their interpretation 
		of the Quran and the Sunnah [many of those are incompatible in today’s 
		world, for example, heart or kidney transplant or even teeth implant]. 
		Since the BNP’s goal and the JI’s interests matched in punishing the 
		lawyers and judges, the JI’s militant affiliates, the JMB launched their 
		bombing especially targeting the Courts, and the Bar Libraries (where 
		lawyers seat and converse) and the <ST1>AL</ST1> leadership. 
		Interestingly, although the terrorist have been bombing or throwing 
		grenades for last 5 years, the government did never published any 
		inquiry report nor ever punished any real terrorists yet.&nbsp; They never 
		published any report as to how those sophisticated military grenades 
		were procured, what happened to truck loads of weapons and bombs, who 
		brought those and for whom, who were the strategists of the grenade 
		attacks on former Finance Minister ASM Kibria, former Prime Minister 
		Sheikh Hasina or on AL leaders, Zebunnessa, Ahsanulla Master or Mayor 
		Kamran. Neither the government published any report stating who 
		manhandled former President Dr. B. Chowdhury or former Foreign Minister, 
		Dr. Kamal Hossain.&nbsp; Instead, they opted to blame the Opposition 
		leadership and at times, they argued that Sheikh Hasina herself staged a 
		melodrama to kill herself through bomb blasts in which 23 died and over 
		350 injured. Do they think that people are that naïve? In the process, 
		they allowed and encouraged their hoodlums and terrorists to gain more 
		confidence and notoriety. </font></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="3">Currently the popularity of the BNP-Jamat 
		government is very precarious due to extreme lawlessness, widespread 
		corruption, run away price hike, near collapse of civil administration, 
		worsening public transport, and sharp economic downswing. The 
		unemployment rate is over 40 percent and the exchange rate depreciated 
		over 18 percent only in last few weeks. Such situation created a general 
		sense of hopelessness, despair and frustration in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> 
		now. Given the near failed governance, if there be a fair election, the 
		BNP-Jamat coalition is likely to face a horrifying defeat. Moreover, if 
		they lose, they believe that the unruly masses will hang them 
		mercilessly due to their atrocities and fascist rule. No wonder, Tariq 
		Zia, eldest son of the Prime Minister and a senior leader of the BNP 
		precisely stated that if they lose, neither he nor any of his stalwarts 
		can survive public wrath [Issued warning at the BNP Regional Conventions

		and the police forces. However, as they know the characteristics of the 
		Bangladeshi officials and the bureaucrats--- once they are no longer 
		their Master, even their chosen ones may betray them and therefore, they 
		are not 100% sure of a total fraudulent win in the next election. The 
		stake is big…..if win, then rule like a king surrounded by sycophants. 
		If lose, then get lynched or hanged. Therefore, the second option is to 
		create more chaos and confusion with a view to declare a ‘national 
		emergency’ and thus to extend her period of governance, and eventually 
		to hand over the power to a military administration. Even in the 
		process, if there is a military takeover, it might help the BNP-Jamat 
		leadership as Begum Zia has relatively higher support in them and 
		secondly, many JI and ICS party members that infiltrated the <ST1>
		Bangladesh</ST1> army could allow them a smooth transition. They can 
		evade public wrath and lynching and take out their illegally accumulated 
		wealth abroad and enjoy it through ‘self exile’ until the situation 
		calms down. Bangladeshis in temperament not vindictive nor they are keen 
		to punish murderers when situation normalizes. Unlike the Jews and the 
		Balkans, they did not try to identify the ‘war criminals’ of 1971 nor 
		ever penalized the murderers of their founding fathers. They even 
		accepted many opportunists as their leaders that are known murderers, 
		criminals and the like without much noise. Knowing that a strong sense 
		of forgiveness among Bangladeshis often times shadows their sense of 
		ethical and moral values leading them to indecision, may prompt the 
		looters to go on ‘self exile’ for a period to enjoy ill-gotten fortune 
		and to reorganize.</font></p>

		<font face="Verdana" size="3">For the JI party, if history is any source 
		of knowledge, it would be a win-win situation. In case of <ST1>Pakistan</ST1>, 
		it was the military government of General Ziaul Huq that helped 
		Islamization and adoption of discriminatory laws like Hudud Laws that 
		helped rise of Islamic militants in <ST1>Pakistan</ST1> and subsequently 
		in <ST1>Afghanistan</ST1>. Chaos, confusion and lawlessness helped 
		developed war lords in <ST1>Afghanistan</ST1> and as people got totally 
		disgusted with them, they welcomed the Taliban, the Islamic militants 
		with the hope of a better life. Unfortunately, the laws, regulations and 
		the know-how of the Taliban were primitive and not compatible to peace, 
		prosperity, competitiveness and economic growth of any nation. 
		Naturally, it failed and failed miserably.&nbsp; </font></p>

		<font face="Verdana" size="3">In <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>, the Islamic 
		militants are looking forward to set up a society that will only bring 
		misery, poverty, lawlessness and disaster like that of Talibans.&nbsp; In 
		spite of such likely outcome, the BNP-Jamat leadership seemingly is 
		opting for it as a transitional measure to evade public lynching. No 
		wonder, their militant partner organizations like JMB, JBJ and HuJ are 
		threatening to explode more bombs and create more chaos and lawlessness. 
		If such lawlessness continues, it may be ripe for Prime Minister Zia to 
		declare a national emergency and if a military general like Ziaul Huq 
		takes over in <ST1>Bangladesh</ST1> in the process, it may pave her 
		smooth transition and may bring a national disaster for years.&nbsp; </font>
