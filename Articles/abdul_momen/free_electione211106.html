												<font face="Verdana">Bangladesh 
												is heading towards a civil war. 
												In one side of the war are those 
												that believe in democracy, rule 
												of law and secularism, and in 
												the other side are those that 
												believe in defrauding the 
												election results through 
												militancy and election 
												engineering. The first group is 
												composed of lawyers, 
												intellectuals, writers, 
												journalists, members of the 
												civil societies and political 
												groups that are pro-democracy 
												and pro-rule of law. This group 
												prefers separation of state and 
												the religion. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">This group 
												of 14-party alliance is led by 
												Sheikh Hasina, former Prime 
												Minister (1996-2001) and a 
												daughter of the founder of the 
												country, Bangabandhu Sheikh 
												Mujibur Rahman. In addition, 
												another group of political 
												leaders led by Dr. AQM B 
												Chowdhury, a former President 
												and Col Wali Ahmed, a former 
												Minister that walked out of the 
												Islamist coalition parties of 
												Prime Minister Khaleda Zia 
												(1991-96 and 2001-06) also 
												joined Sheikh Hasina. Major 
												General Anwarul Kabir Talukdar, 
												until recently Energy Minister 
												stated that his government led 
												by Prime Minister Zia defrauded 
												the nation over $10 billion only 
												from the Energy Sector in the 
												past 5 years and in protest, he 
												resigned. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">No wonder, 
												until recently, Bangladesh was 
												known as the most corrupt 
												country as per the Transparency 
												International, an international 
												corruption watchdog. However, 
												good news is that after 
												consecutive 5 years in a row, 
												this is the 1st time that Haiti 
												and Iraq superceded Bangladesh 
												in corruption. As per 
												Bangladeshi economists, nearly 
												75% of all its foreign aid and 
												assistance amounting to over $37 
												billion either has been misused 
												or looted. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">The other 
												warring group is composed of 
												Islamic and leftist militants 
												plus pro-Pakistan elements that 
												rocked the nation with bomb 
												blasts and terrorism, and 
												mastermind repeated target 
												killing of over 1,500 people. It 
												maimed nearly 20,000 and 
												imprisoned over half a million 
												under various pretexts. This 
												group killed 800 extra 
												judiciously and its coalition 
												partner vows to establish Sharia 
												Law ending Western type 
												democracy in Bangladesh. </font>
												</p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">This second 
												group is led by Begum Khaleda 
												Zia, and her son Tariq Zia plus 
												their hand-picked President and 
												Chief of the Care-taker 
												Government, Dr. Iazuddin Ahmed, 
												a 76-year old heart patient. 
												Begum Zia is the widow of 
												General Ziaur Rahman who emerged 
												as a ‘strong man’ in the 
												nation’s 1st military coup in 
												1975 in which founder President 
												Sheikh Mujib and his entire 
												family members except two were 
												mercilessly murdered. Gen. Zia 
												allowed the murderers let go 
												free. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">Begum Zia 
												has formed a 4-party alliance 
												composing mostly Islamists and 
												anti-liberation forces that were 
												opposed to Bangladesh’s 
												independence in 1971. Her main 
												advisers are former leftist/ 
												communist leaders that had good 
												link with China. In fact, she 
												developed a very good rapport 
												with the People’s Republic of 
												China. She masterminded her 
												support by being anti-India and 
												pro-Islam. Pakistan is her best 
												support followed by Saudi 
												Arabia. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">Bangladesh 
												Election: A History of 
												Manipulated Results </font></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">Bangladesh 
												has a history of ‘doctored 
												elections’ that started with her 
												husband, General Ziaur Rahman. 
												When he usurped state powers and 
												became the Chief Martial Law 
												Administrator and the President, 
												he arranged a nation-wide voting 
												in which ‘he was the only 
												candidate’ and he obtained 99% 
												votes. As international opinion 
												was not favorable, he asked his 
												officials to arrange less than 
												99% votes in the subsequent 
												elections and that was done. He 
												received 88% in 1981 
												Presidential election as per his 
												desire. Thus ‘a tradition of 
												voting fraud’ started in 
												Bangladesh and generally, 
												corrupt government officials are 
												the major vehicle of such 
												doctored elections. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">In 1991, 
												through a mass upsurge, the 
												military government of general H 
												M Ershad was toppled. With a 
												view to have ‘free, fair, 
												non-partisan and credible’ 
												elections, Bangladesh adopted a 
												unique system known as 
												‘Non-partisan Care-taker 
												government’. Under this system, 
												after the expiry of 5-year term 
												of an elected government, a 
												non-partisan interim government 
												would be formed for 90-days 
												comprising one Chief Advisor 
												(CA) and 10 Advisors. Their main 
												function is to present a 
												‘non-partisan, free, fair, 
												non-violent and credible’ 
												election to the nation. As per 
												Constitution, the CA must be a 
												non-partisan person. 1st 
												preference for this post is for 
												the immediate past retired Chief 
												Justice of the nation’s highest 
												court. If he/she is not 
												available, then sincere efforts 
												would be made to have a 
												non-partisan individual to be 
												appointed as the Head of the 
												Caretaker government. Under such 
												system, the nation conducted 
												three elections, one in 1991, 
												another in 1996 and third one in 
												2001. In the case of the 3rd 
												one, the CA was Justice Latifur 
												Rahman. He was morally corrupt. 
												As he presented a debatable 
												election in 2001 for which the 
												winning party provided him some 
												fortune including a free house, 
												therefore, the Opposition 
												parties wanted an improvement in 
												their Caretaker government 
												system by making necessary 
												reforms. They demanded that the 
												election process be transparent 
												and fair. As against their 
												demands, the Khaleda Zia 
												government made the system more 
												controversial. Now the future of 
												the Caretaker government is at 
												stake. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">In order to 
												defraud and doctor the election 
												results, Mrs. Zia appointed 
												partisan people at the nation’s 
												Election Commission (EC) that is 
												responsible for conducting the 
												upcoming elections. The EC 
												created a ‘voter list’ that 
												included over 14 million ‘ghost 
												voters’ and it appointed over 
												16,000 election officials that 
												are committed ‘jehadis’ with no 
												moral scruples. In addition, the 
												EC excluded in its Voter list 
												the Opposition Party activists 
												and their sympathizers plus it 
												excluded over 10 million of the 
												nation’s minority groups mostly 
												Hindus, Christians and the 
												Buddhists. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">The Causes 
												of Current Conflict </font></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">The 
												Opposition parties challenged 
												such faulty voter list in the 
												nation’s highest court and the 
												Court gave the verdict in their 
												favor. But unfortunately, the 
												government and the EC did not 
												comply the Court verdict. 
												Instead, Mrs. Zia replaced the 
												judges and appointed 29 new 
												judges from its party cadres. In 
												addition, she changed the 
												retirement age of the judges 
												with a view to appoint her own 
												party-executive whom she made a 
												Chief Justice (K. M. Hasan) to 
												be the next Chief of the 
												Caretaker government in 2006. 
												The opposition opposed such 
												moves and demanded a ‘level 
												playing filed’ for a free and 
												fair election. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">As the 
												government refused, the 
												opposition parties started a 
												nation-wide movement in which 
												nearly 40 were killed and over 
												10,000 wounded. Violence erupted 
												and it basically paralyzed the 
												country. It cut off the nation’s 
												capital Dhaka from the rest of 
												the country. Under the 
												situation, K. M. Hasan expressed 
												his inability to be the Chief 
												Advisor. When he was 
												unavailable, instead of 
												following the steps outlined in 
												the Constitution, President Dr. 
												Iazuddin Ahmed, a Begum Zia 
												appointee unilaterally usurped 
												all powers and declared himself 
												as a CA plus President. He 
												appointed a 10 member Advisory 
												Council. The opposition halted 
												its movement and submitted 
												11-point demands for ensuring a 
												‘free, fair, transparent and 
												credible election’ giving Dr. 
												Ahmed an opportunity to be 
												neutral. All foreign governments 
												that are partners of Bangladesh 
												development including the U. S. 
												and the EU applauded such 
												compromising move of the 
												opposition parties. </font></p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">Although 
												nearly 3-weeks have passed and 
												reportedly all the newly 
												appointed Advisors unanimously 
												agreed to replace the most 
												controversial individuals for 
												example, the Chief Election 
												Commissioner MA Aziz and his 3 
												associates, Dr. Ahmed, the Chief 
												Advisor and President is still 
												reluctant to take any step that 
												might weaken Begum Zia’s 
												election set up. Moreover, Begum 
												Zia threatened that if the 
												Caretaker government takes steps 
												to dislodge her set up, it would 
												be a Constitutional violation 
												and they would resist. As the 
												Caretaker government failed to 
												reform the EC or as failed to 
												take any step yet to prove its 
												neutrality, there is possibility 
												that the opposition parties 
												would resume their nationwide 
												mass movement for a ‘free, fair, 
												transparent and credible’ 
												election in January 2007. </font>
												</p>
												<p align="justify"></p>
												<p align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana">President 
												and CA with the support of the 
												4-party Islamist alliance may do 
												its best to foil the movement 
												and therefore, a clash is 
												imminent. He also alerted the 
												nation’s army. However, the U. 
												S. Secretary of State for South 
												and Central Asian Affairs, 
												Richard Boucher advised the 
												Bangladesh army not to usurp 
												powers. Whether or not the 
												nation’s army refuses to take 
												powers, violence and street 
												fighting may erupt between the 
												pro-Khaleda Islamists and the 
												pro-democracy activists. The 
												Islamists are well armed and 
												well funded with illegal money 
												and more importantly, they have 
												the jehadi spirit. However, the 
												opposition activists are 
												numerous and they have the moral 
												support of the nation. Under 
												such a situation, if a consensus 
												is not achieved quickly, this 
												nation of 147 million is likely 
												to suffer, suffer 
												badly---economically, socially 
												and politically. Can an 
												impoverished country like 
												Bangladesh sustain such 
												uncertainty and loss?</font> </p>
