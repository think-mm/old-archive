		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The world is watching a very 
		unusual and attractive game being orchestrated in Bangladesh, with the 
		national parliamentary election at the centre. The Awami League-led 
		grand alliance (GA) has boycotted the 9th parliamentary election 
		scheduled to be held on January 22. The BNP-led four-party alliance (FPA), 
		on the contrary, is going to participate in this one-sided election. GA 
		has not only boycotted this election, but has also vowed to resist this 
		electoral game because of the president-cum-caretaker chief. I'm 
		disturbed, thinking about the role, and the plight, of the people in 
		this arranged game.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<br>
		Undoubtedly, the present political catastrophe, which is turning into a 
		constitutional crisis, will impact negatively on the constantly 
		declining political culture of Bangladesh. It is very easy to postulate 
		that the two alliances are doing all these things to get back to power. 
		Rather, we need to look critically at the matter around the event. It is 
		more sensible to look at the issue from the people's perspective. I 
		intend to locate this event on an &quot;integrated-premise&quot; of dynamics of 
		parliamentary politics, politics of vote-bank, and strategies of holding 
		power in Bangladesh politics. <br>
		Dynamics of parliamentary politics is a process where three 
		inter-related components -- the interim government, the regular 
		administration including the EC, and the political parties -- function 
		together towards establishing a legitimate body of the elite, now mostly 
		businessmen, to run the state for the next five years. One always 
		ignored section is the people, though the political parties always talk 
		of them, reciting the popular myth: &quot;The people are the source of all 
		power.&quot; In practice, the people are always used in the process of 
		establishing this legitimate body of the elite. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		In the dynamics of parliamentary politics, two sections -- the interim 
		government and the regular administration including the EC -- have 
		already lost public confidence and acceptance of majority political 
		parties, except for the four-party alliance, for their non-sensible 
		deeds and apparent partisan affiliation. The third section -- the 
		political parties -- are the key players in the dynamics of 
		parliamentary politics. This section always thinks of, and acts for, 
		regulating the dynamics of parliamentary politics, and components of 
		this dynamism, to create favourable space for being included in the 
		legitimate body at any cost. In this context, the FPA is much more 
		advanced than the GA in many respects. The FPA, the immediate erstwhile 
		ruling alliance, left a set of submissive personnel in every department 
		of the state, including the caretaker government and EC. The FPA is, 
		very likely, eager to have the election held as soon as possible as it 
		is sure of coming back to power. The GA, from the very beginning, 
		pressed a charter of demands before the interim government, regulated by 
		FPA, with the intention of creating minimum space for themselves. The GA 
		believe that they deserve the full space in the other two components of 
		the &quot;integrated premise&quot; of parliamentary politics. Apparently, GA 
		failed in creating adequate space in the dynamics of parliamentary 
		politics, but because of strong belief of holding the other two 
		components favourably -- politics of vote-bank and power of election -- 
		they, at a certain moment in their movement, decided to take part in the 
		parliamentary election. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		Politics of vote-bank is another regulatory component for better 
		understanding the recurrent political events of Bangladesh. The GA 
		ensured the majority vote-bank by welcoming Ershad into the coalition, 
		signing a pledge with Islamist parties, and adopting the LDP, the 
		Adivasi Forum, and other smaller political groups. Besides, there is an 
		established perception that all minority and all secular votes will be 
		reserved for AL and its alliance. It is to be mentioned here that, after 
		the signing of the pledge with the little-known Islamists, the 
		intellectuals, civil society, entire media world, and secular sections 
		of society started raising their voices proclaiming that the AL had 
		damaged the image of its more than 50-year political history, glory, and 
		heritage. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		It is being frequently said by those sections that the AL has violated 
		the foundation of secularism in the political and state history of 
		Bangladesh. I don't find any sensible reason to blame the AL because 
		such desire is not necessarily linked with the AL action only. However, 
		signing the pledge was nothing but simply the politics of vote-bank. 
		Whether AL will be benefited or not is a different question, but the AL 
		wanted to ensure an Islamic vote-bank. It is often said that Bangladesh 
		has a big Islamic vote-bank in rural and semi-urban areas. Nevertheless, 
		the GA tried to ensure the whole space for themselves in the politics of 
		vote-bank. On the contrary, FPA has minimum space in the politics of 
		vote-bank. The only way for them to foil this calculation is to use the 
		caretaker chief, EC, and administrative set up that is still allegedly 
		devoted to four-party. That's why the BNP is so enthusiastic in 
		&quot;upholding the constitution.&quot; </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		The power in Bangladesh politics, especially in the politics of 
		parliamentary election, is absolutely the people whom I'm thinking 
		about. In fact, every five years, the people have the only chance to 
		utilize their power to participate in state-management, engaging in the 
		process towards establishing a legitimate body through parliamentary 
		election. This power is an integral part of dynamism in the politics of 
		parliamentary election. Truly speaking, this power is key to reshuffling 
		the entire political arrangement for the country. However, it is always 
		used, largely misused, by political parties. Despite this, the people 
		play a vital role in changing the regime of political parties, though 
		there has been no remarkable change in their lives. In contemporary 
		Bangladesh, the people, the powerhouse, are totally fed-up and 
		disappointed by the rule of FPA government for three notable reasons -- 
		complete failure in power sector, uncontrolled price-hike, and rampant 
		corruption and nepotism in every department of the state. This 
		disappointment, GA actually think, will turn into the rejection of BNP 
		and its alliance in the forthcoming election. The people, therefore, GA 
		thinks, will support them in the 9th parliamentary election. 
		Nevertheless, GA is out of this election. Now, what should the people 
		do? </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		The demands of GA -- removal of caretaker chief, preparing updated voter 
		list, neutralization of EC, de-politicization of administration, etc -- 
		are no longer their political demand. It has turned into a public 
		demand. However, BNP is impatiently moving towards being back in power, 
		without considering any demand of the people. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		It is clear that whatever the caretaker chief and EC are doing is just 
		to bring FPA back to power. The power-seeking political culture of 
		Bangladesh always ignores public-interest. If the election is held, it 
		will, unfortunately, unveil the ugly face of political manipulation of 
		the caretaker chief, EC, and the entire election mechanism of 
		Bangladesh. <br>
		Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that either boycotting or 
		participating in election is simply an elite-game. If the people are 
		really the power in politics and election, why should they participate 
		in this game? Rather, I propose, the people should resist the entire 
		manipulation of electoral-dynamism by boycotting this election. Not 
		necessarily to support GA, but to keep the spirit of upholding public 
		interest. </font>

		don't vote. Now, this is a real weapon. <br>
