		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Daily Star printed a news as 
		‘Police yesterday arrested BNP-aligned Rajshahi University teacher Prof 
		Mia Muhammad Mohiuddin of geology and mining department at his teachers’ 
		quarters house in connection with the killing of his colleague Prof S 
		Taher Ahmed’(05/02/06). ‘Professor killed a professor’-what a shame! 
		What a horror! What an image of university teacher! </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Taher killing can be, I 
		sturdily believe, a factual case to comprehend the nature, and emerging 
		culture too, of university, university teachers and the implication of 
		political interfere in the state of affairs of public universities in 
		Bangladesh. The image of university teachers assembled with people’s 
		admiration, respect and aspiration has been unmasked with this killing 
		case. If any reasonable and sensible person analyzes and examines the 
		causes, background, arrangement and way of implementing this killing, 
		s/he can find a repulsive scenario about what’s happening inside our 
		public universities. It is really a matter of indignity that a 
		university teacher even can murder his colleague to remove the 
		impediment only for the sake of promotion. There have several types of 
		allegation already been publicly disclosed against university teachers 
		including sexual assault, corruption, irregularities with examination, 
		nepotism, and recently the connection with the outlaw organization of 
		Islamic militants etc. But, killing, notably own colleague for cleaning 
		the path of promotion, is a latest and sensational addition to the image 
		of university teacher. It pitches many questions before us. So, what’s 
		the difference between a killer and a university teacher? Who are 
		responsible for this killing? Is only the killer? Who are the real 
		criminals? How can we protect our universities from this alarming 
		process of decaying? How can we keep alive our hopes and aspirations by 
		saving our university for building the future of nation? We should ask 
		ourselves as citizens of this country as we are paying our labored 
		earning to run these universities. And we are all, implicitly or 
		explicitly, an indispensable part of this damage and decay as 
		organically we are interconnected to each other in social institutions.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh, due to consecutive 
		destructive-events and horrific evidences, has been losing its moral 
		landscape and century-long image of history and cultural heritage. 
		Within 35 years of independence, she has been gradually declining her 
		images that gained in 1971, and through long movement before that, 
		through a glorious liberation-movement in the recurrent history of the 
		world. Now, Bangladesh frequently appears, before the local and global 
		audience, as a country of bomb explosion, Islamic militancy, for the 
		ever best corruption, emerging extreme-fundamentalism and constant 
		political unrest etc. Despite these considerable depletion, public 
		universities and their teachers still have little positive, honorable 
		and intellectual image, though it is mostly fake, among the countrymen. 
		It’s undeniable truth that university teachers have admirable 
		contributions in all progressive social-political movements, creative 
		writings &amp; literature, in-dept research and publications, advancement of 
		science and technology, and finally building scholarship etc. But, 
		recent event of Dr. Taher killing and its entire killing management, 
		cause and background, has brought this image of university and 
		university teachers under a big question. It is a question of morality, 
		integrity, quality and spirit of teaching. This event disclosed the 
		insider decaying palpitation of university and the image of university 
		teachers. I don’t agree to make sweeping comments, or even to absolutely 
		blame, on all the teachers in an analogous line of thought. 
		Additionally, I don’t incline to censure Dr. Mohiuddin alone for this 
		occasion anyway. Rather, I am apprehensive to look at the practice of 
		being Dr. Mohiuddin. We should deeply think of it. What are the reasons 
		influentially functioning behind it? I strappingly believe that simply 
		saying the only reason is the political interfere of our central 
		political leaders in the state of affairs of university despite of its 
		being constitutionally an autonomous body. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This criminalization of 
		university and university teaching begins from the recruitment of its 
		teachers. At the time of recruitment, university authority is enforced 
		and compelled to appoint the political cadres as a teacher. As VC and 
		Pro-VC are the posts of political nomination, they are always blessed 
		with central political leaders, they always follow the order emerged 
		from top. They, VC &amp; Pro-VC, virtually think of keeping their chairs 
		safe rather than the greater interest of university. Therefore, they 
		become unconditioned followers of the Hukum (order) of their political 
		Guru (leaders). In consequences, the cadres recruited to the post of 
		teachers can never be personalized with the moral spirit of teaching. 
		They throughout their service remain cadres as they tag along the order 
		of their god-fathers and bow their loyalty towards our nasty politics 
		and corrupted politicians. I suppose and believe that a person who 
		regularly takes classes and faces the fresh-students having dream of 
		building a new world can’t be a killer. A person who possesses the 
		minimum spirit of teaching can’t be a killer. A teacher who has the 
		moral values and dedication towards his profession can’t be a killer. A 
		teacher who keeps the minimal level of honesty, responsibility and 
		patriotism towards his society and country can’t be a killer. A teacher 
		who thinks of being the eligible of trust of students can’t be a killer. 
		I would like to believe, a university teacher, in any contemplation in 
		any circumstance, can’t be a killer. So, the killer and cadre, reported 
		teacher, is never composed himself as a teacher. A cadre is a cadre and 
		all through he is cadre anyway. Teaching is not his/her profession but 
		means of earning money and livelihood only. Teaching is not his/her 
		service, to serve the student, to serve the society and the country, but 
		a podium of fulfilling his/her voracity and aspirations. Teaching is not 
		his/her obsession but also a utensil of using its reflection and 
		fortitude for his/her vested interest. Teaching is not his/her 
		profession but a fake-identity to exploit its image and acceptability 
		among the people and in the society. S/He is in university not for 
		teaching but being an agent to implement the political order of 
		god-father, and mother, to expand and establish the hegemony of 
		political party. So, the teacher who can kill other teacher is not 
		really a teacher. That’s why, I don’t fully agree, or course I agree 
		that there is an alarming trend of decaying the real spirit of teaching 
		inside university, with those who are in voice claiming that the damage 
		of image of university and university teachers in connection with this 
		killing. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, we should raise the 
		question who/what is the real killer? If a teacher can kill his/her 
		colleague, who/what reason is responsible for this killing? Who/what is 
		responsible to over politicize the university campus? Who/what is 
		intentionally forcing university authority to recruit a cadre instead of 
		a teacher? Who/what is responsible to patronize and provoke a university 
		teacher to be a killer? Who/what is liable to generate this event in 
		university campus? Who/what is playing influential role to damage the 
		image of university? Who/what is illegally interfering in the state of 
		affairs of university despite of its being an autonomous body? Who/what 
		is responsible to drive the real teachers out from the university? We 
		have to, as it is high time, find out the answer of these questions to 
		prevent, of course to regain, the image of universities and teachers as 
		well as expectation of people still we have from completely damaging and 
		decaying. The future, as still it is strongly perceived that university 
		is making and building the future for nation, of this country, and 
		university too, rests upon the answer of these questions and its 
		affective solution. Because, I, definitely many like me, still believe 
		that teaching is not only a profession but also a mission to build the 
		nation. </font></p>
