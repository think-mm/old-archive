    <p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
	On Sep the 12th 1996, the United Front government led by then Prime Minister 
	H D Deve Gowda introduced the Women’s Reservation Bill to the Lok Sabha, the 
	Lower House of the Indian Parliament. Following the bill’s introduction the 
	President’s address spoke about it with the following glowing words: <i>&quot;We 
	are also keen to promote gender equality and removal of discrimination 
	against women. As you know, the Government has already introduced a Bill for 
	Reservation of Seats for Women in Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies to 
	ensure their better participation in policy making.&quot;</i><br>
	<br>
	Several governments have come and gone in India since then, and nothing has 
	happened. Personally, I seriously doubt the pious wish expressed in the 
	sentence: &quot;We are also keen to promote gender equality and removal of 
	discrimination against women.” What was the bill, though? It suggested that 
	for a period of 15 years (following which it would be reviewed by a Joint 
	Committee of both Houses of Parliament) every third election in various 
	constituencies in the country would be restricted to women candidates alone. 
	For a decade now, the Women’s Reservation Bill has been a matter of extreme 
	political polarization and controversy, touching several raw nerves all at 
	once due to its very nature: it proposed to reserve 33.3% seats in 
	Parliament and state legislatures for women. Quite naturally, this quota for 
	women would mean men having to vacate their offices or seats for at least 
	one five year term in the next Lok Sabha. Intelligent, capable and competent 
	women were certain to, make an impact in Parliament and state legislatures 
	and erode the power of male MPs. Many male MPs were personally threatened as 
	they would lose their constituencies – centers of personal vested 
	interest-to women. Most of the criminals and antisocial elements who manage 
	to evade arrest by getting elected to office in India would have been forced 
	to vacate their seats of power.<br>
	<br>
	The “magic” number of 33% as the quota for women contesting elections was 
	given on a completely unexplained basis. Reservation for discriminated 
	groups like the formerly discriminated Hindu Castes has been determined on 
	the basis of their numerical strength in the overall population. Even here, 
	in a country where women form a number somewhat less than 50% of the 
	population, the same numerical basis was not given in their favor. It would 
	be easy to be cynical and say that the Magical figure of 33% represents some 
	projection into the near future of Indian women's declining sex ratio?<br>
	<br>
	To give the devils their due, village and tribal assemblies, Panchayats, 
	already have a 33% reservation for women. Why, then, has there been 
	opposition to a similar proposal for Parliament and state legislatures?<br>
	<br>
	Opponents argue that reservation would only help women of Elitist groups. 
	They say that women from the elite would gain political power, aggravating 
	the plight of the poor and deprived sections, therefore, causing further 
	discrimination and under-representation to the poor and backward classes. 
	They also fear that many male leaders would not get a chance to fight 
	elections if 33 percent of seats were reserved for women. The Bill’s 
	advocates say that it is essential to ensure active political participation 
	by women and lead to gender equality in Parliament, resulting in the 
	empowerment of women as a whole. Historically, women have been deprived and 
	discriminated against in India. Increased political participation of women 
	would help them fight the abuse, discrimination, and inequality they suffer 
	from, say the Bill’s supporters.<br>
	<br>
	The problem is that the Bill’s opponents seem to vastly outnumber it’s 
	advocates because it has not been passed or even come close to being passed 
	for ten years now. One excuse that has been offered to stall it has been 
	that it does not offer a quota for discriminated caste Hindu women within 
	the 33% quota for women. I personally find this argument difficult to 
	accept. With all sympathy for my OBC sisters, may I ask those gentlemen, who 
	offer this excuse to stall this legislation, FIRST OF ALL WHERE DO WOMEN 
	HAVE ANY CASTE PRIVILEGE IN A PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY? WHEN THEY MARRY THEY LOSE 
	THEIR NATAL FAMILY NAME AND THEIR CHILDREN DO NOT CARRY THEIR LINEAGE!!! THE 
	CHILDREN THEY GIVE BIRTH TO BELONG TO THEIR HUSBANDS’ FAMILY!!! And, if this 
	concern were genuine, why could those who would like to see reservation for 
	discriminated caste Hindu women within the context of the 33% overall 
	reservation not incorporate an amendment to the original bill or bring in a 
	private amendment with this feature instead of defeating the original bill 
	wholesale? Moreover, is it not a fact that among the one-third reserved 
	seats for women, there are bound to be a number of seats which would go to 
	women from the discriminated castes? If this were a concern, why do these 
	opponents not put forward discriminated caste women candidates as their own 
	party’s representatives in elections?</font></p>
	<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are 
	people, who oppose the Bill on the grounds that it should also include a 
	quota for Muslim women, dividing women even further. And, while they claim 
	that they work in the interest of the discriminated castes, they have been 
	talking about agreeing to pass the bill if the reservation were slashed from 
	33 to 15%.The election commission suggested a way out of the impasse by 
	reserving some seats exclusively for women. With this came the automatic 
	response from opponents of the bill that they would like to increase the 
	total number of seats in Parliament to 900 if this were to happen, as they 
	could not stomach losing 181 seats from the present total to women 
	candidates. In the present Loksabha (lower house of the Indian Parliament) 
	there are 268 discriminated caste MPs, not due to any reservation given to 
	them, but due to caste configurations in various states. So, if male 
	discriminated caste MPs could be elected in such large numbers without 
	reservation, why not women? It is crystal clear that there is a conspiracy 
	to continue male dominance in the corridors of power.Two of the parties 
	opposed to the bill, the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janatha Dal, have 
	only two to three women MPs out of a total of 38 MPs. If these parties call 
	themselves the champions of discriminated caste Hindu women, why they do not 
	allot one third of their party tickets to women in the Loksabha polls? Why 
	are there not enough women in the posts of party functionaries and office 
	bearers? The list is endless and the questions are unanswered as the 
	“saviors” of discriminated caste women remain tightlipped on these issues. 
	Their “concern” for the discriminated castes is just one more excuse to 
	stall the Bill yet again.Further, the Joint Committee looking into this 
	issue has recommended to the Government to consider the question of 
	discriminated caste reservation as and when they think fit. If such a 
	constitutional amendment is brought and Parliament in its wisdom would pass 
	that Bill, then discriminated caste women would automatically come within 
	the purview of one-third reservation. Then, why do male politicians hold up 
	this Bill on such an excuse? Some Members of Parliament ask from where so 
	many able women would come who would be fit to be Members of Legislative 
	Assemblies and the Lok Sabha. May I say with all humility that this is an 
	assessment of women from the point of view of our patriarchal society or the 
	personal views/hypocrisy of some high men? Think back to 1952 - the first 
	general elections. The percentage of women elected to the First Loksabha was 
	only 4.4. Are we to believe that among the stalwart freedom fighters of our 
	country there was such a dearth of capable women that they could not put up 
	more candidates and get them in Parliament? Has the situation changed 
	substantially since then? In 1996, the percentage was 7.2. The highest 
	percentage ever reached in Loksabha was 8.1 per cent in 1985. Who can deny 
	that over the past fifty years of Independence, despite many difficulties 
	and denial of equal opportunities, our women have made a mark in new and 
	varied fields of life? Many of them have distinguished themselves as 
	teachers, as doctors, as engineers, as officers in different disciplines and 
	most important as social and political workers. Lakhs of common women have 
	participated in the struggle of all sections of our nation for winning their 
	own sectoral demands, for improving the quality of life of their families 
	and society, for defending our national unity and for widening the content 
	of our democracy! What better political education can there be for potential 
	candidates to decision making bodies at all levels? </font></p>
	<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another excuse 
	raised is, if one-third seats were given to women, there would be a dearth 
	of able MPs and MLAs and that the standard of performance of the legislative 
	bodies would go down. Let us respectfully suggest taking an opinion poll of 
	those who are watching the live TV broadcast of Parliament Sessions. It 
	would be interesting to see what the voters think about the standard of 
	performance of the present House where 92.8 per cent are men MPs and only 
	7.2 per cent are women. <b><font color="#FF0000">Why is it that the 
	politicians who committed themselves to these measures have done nothing to 
	enhance the participation of women within their respective parties?</font>
	</b>How can 33 percent reservation for women in Parliament and state 
	assemblies’ work, if there aren’t enough women active in parties, if the 
	parties don’t have enough viable candidates to field? What measures of 
	internal reform are these parties contemplating in order to include women in 
	party decision making and leadership roles? Why are they not ready to share 
	their space with women??? <b>I take the liberty of quoting a statement of 
	Mahatma Gandhi:</b> <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Woman is the companion of man 
	gifted with equal mental Capacities. She has the right to participate in the 
	minutest details of the activities of man and she has the same right of 
	freedom of liberty as he. By sheer force of a vicious custom, even the most 
	ignorant and worthless men have been enjoying a superiority over women which 
	they do not deserve and ought not to have.&quot;</font> While women are 
	increasingly mobilizing and empowering themselves in groups/organizations 
	and contributing to liberation movements and movements for democracy, when 
	it comes to leadership and decision making positions within most of these 
	organizations and movements, women are a distinct minority and their 
	participation in electoral politics is significantly smaller.<br>
	<br>
	Why are there very few women in elected or appointed government positions? 
	There are several major reasons for this. For one thing, the whole political 
	culture and style is male dominated and alien to women. Political power 
	today is increasingly exercised by government bureaucracies and high 
	political offices are often filled by appointments from the top levels of 
	the civil service, so that women’s exclusion from this sphere significantly 
	weakens their opportunities for political participation and power. Given the 
	prevailing situation in electoral politics, many women have opted to work 
	for political and social change outside the system. However, an increasing 
	number of women have felt this work needs to be complemented by 
	strengthening their positions within the political power system. Without 
	decision making power and control at all levels, the gains women have made 
	are very easily ignored and eroded. <font color="#FF0000"><b>Too many of the 
	major economic and political decisions in the world are being made without 
	any input from women.</b></font> There is a growing conviction about the 
	need to influence policy and political decisions not only through lobbying 
	and other actions on the outside, but through wielding political power in 
	decision making positions too.<br>
	<br>
	Most women face tremendous opposition from family, community and the male 
	political leadership if they decide to enter electoral politics or public 
	life. The present political leadership, in spite of its populist rhetoric, 
	wants to keep women out of the political scene. Women politicians are still 
	looked upon as appendages to the males in the political arena. Indian 
	women’s lower educational level, inferior social status and lack of autonomy 
	are reflected in their lower participation in politics. Increasing 
	criminalization, corruption and compromises required to sustain one’s 
	political career deter women from entering mainstream politics.<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#0000FF">QUOTAS NOT ONLY CREATE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, BUT BRING 
	ABOUT EQUAL PARTICIPATION TO GET EQUALITY IN THE FINAL RESULT, BY CREATING 
	EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY. ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT REPRESENTATION, NOT EDUCATION 
	AND QUALIFICATION. THE CORE IDEA BEHIND QUOTA SYSTEMS IS TO ENROLL WOMEN 
	INTO POLITICAL POSITIONS AND TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ARE NOT ISOLATED IN 
	POLITICAL LIFE.</font><br>
	<br>
	A number of strategies and mechanisms are being used to increase women’s 
	participation in electoral politics. Some of these are mechanisms set up by 
	government such as quotas. Quotas have been used more successfully to 
	increase the number of women in the LEADERSHIP OF POLITICAL PARTIES and in 
	their election lists particularly where there is already a strong group of 
	women within the party pressing for changes.<br>
	<br>
	Political participation is a major path to women’s empowerment; to increased 
	decision making power and greater ability to influence matters that affect 
	our lives in the community and the larger society. In the broad sense, 
	participation in politics goes far beyond electoral politics; voting and 
	election to public office.<br>
	<br>
	But Parliament is a people’s representative body, and people mean men and 
	women. What Parliament, therefore, do we have at present with just 50 
	percent of the people represented? What type of democracy does India have? 
	Can the democracy afford to be gender blind? For any democratic process, the 
	world’s half of population i.e. women’s perspective on issues and their 
	active and equitable involvement in politics are an integral aspect. Hence, 
	democracy, by definition, cannot afford to be gender blind- it must strive 
	towards equality and representation of women and men in decision making 
	process and in the opportunities to achieve both these goals.<br>
	<br>
	There are, it must be admitted, several problems inherent in this particular 
	scheme as proposed in the bill. Accepting 33 percent permanent reservation 
	for women is like demanding that some seats be reserved in every bus for 
	women or the equivalent of a ladies compartment in every train. Men then 
	come to expect women to remain confined to the ‘ladies section’ and assume 
	that all the remaining seats are reserved for them. Even though there would 
	be no legal bar on women contesting from non women specific reserved 
	constituencies if the bill were to be passed it is highly unlikely that 
	women would be given tickets from outside the reserved constituencies. This 
	same pattern is evident with the discriminated castes who have been 
	permanently confined to reserved constituencies.<br>
	<br>
	<font color="#FF0000">THE QUOTA SYSTEM PLACES THE BURDEN OF ENROLMENT NOT ON 
	THE INDIVIDUAL WOMAN, BUT ON THOSE WHO CONTROL THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS.</font><br>
	<br>
	The present scheme of reservation would ensure that women would enter the 
	electoral battle only against other women and never get an opportunity to 
	contest against men, a sure way to perpetually ghettoize women’s politics. 
	As it is, women in India have deeply imbibed the notion that ‘women are 
	women’s worst enemies’ because of the way they are pitched against each 
	other in the family structure. Their dependence on men estranges them from 
	other women because men mediate women’s relations with the outside world. 
	Therefore political solidarity among women is hard to build.<br>
	<br>
	I think the main hurdle in the way of the passage of this Bill is the fear 
	of some men that they would be deprived of their seats and consequently 
	their leadership. It is true that some men MPs will be deprived of their 
	seats for some time as the 7.2 per cent seats held by women now would 
	increase to 33 percent. But, in any case, as per the bill’s provisions, the 
	seats reserved for women would rotate and moreover the reservation is 
	supposed to be reviewed after 15 years according to the Joint Committee's 
	recommendation. For capable long-standing established political leaders, 
	there should be no problem in contesting and winning from another 
	constituency nearby. In any case, none of WOMEN have come to the politics 
	with the idea that THEY shall be life-long occupants of THEIR seats as MPs 
	and MLAs. The necessity of giving reservation has arisen from the fact that 
	despite being almost 50 per cent of the voters, the representation of women 
	in decision making bodies has remained insignificant. Does this not also 
	deprive the whole of society by not utilizing the talents of women in the 
	highest decision making fora? Has this not impoverished our democracy to a 
	considerable extent? I again implore the male POLITICIANS here to establish 
	a real partnership between men and women in the highest decision making 
	forum in order to hit out unitedly against the age old discrimination 
	against women, and thereby, let us help in the establishment of a joint 
	leadership of men and women which could only enrich our democracy and 
	advance our society.<br>
	<br>
	<b>THE CHALLENGES AHEAD</b><br>
	<br>
	The road ahead is full of challenges for women’s participation in politics. 
	Strategies must be developed and strengthened to give women access to 
	decision making positions within different political power structures. 
	Strategies must also be developed to strengthen women as a constituency 
	which can make its demands felt on political parties and governments and 
	become a force to support women in politics.<br>
	<br>
	It is imperative that unless and until women take the forefront in politics, 
	pressing issues pertaining to women like the quota controversies and from 
	women point of view, the hither too suppressed expression will continue. 
	Therefore, women taking active role in politics is a need, not a fancy or 
	just a power struggle. LET US ENTER POLITICS, CONTINUE OUR STRUGGLE AND TAKE 
	LEADERSHIP. WOMEN CANNOT PUT UP WITH PATRIARCHAL POWER ANY MORE!</font><span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
