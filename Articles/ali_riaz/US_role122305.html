						Abstract</span> </p>
						<p align="justify"><i>During the South Asian crisis in 
						1971, the US administration, especially the White House, 
						stood firmly behind the Pakistani President Yahya Khan 
						and demonstrated a disdain for India and particularly 
						its leader Indira Gandhi. Historians and analysts have 
						previously insisted that Pakistan's role as a conduit of 
						rapprochement with China and Henry Kissinger's focus on 
						geopolitical concerns greatly influenced the American 
						policy decision in 1971. These claims have now been 
						confirmed by the recently declassified US foreign policy 
						documents in Foreign Relations of the United States, XI 
						and its companion electronic volume. These volumes also 
						suggest that the US administration undertook at least 
						three initiatives to dissipate the Bangladesh movement, 
						an aspect largely ignored in the historical accounts of 
						the South Asian crisis. Drawing on the documents in 
						these volumes, other declassified documents available at 
						the US National Archives, and the Bangladeshi sources 
						this paper constructs a narrative of these three US 
						initiatives. It also insists that US clandestine 
						efforts, described as a “political settlement” 
						contributed to the bloodshed instead of bringing it to 
						an end.</i></p>
						<p align="justify"><span class="ArticleSubHeader">Full 
						Text</span></p>
						<p align="justify">The role of the United States during 
						the South Asian crisis in 1971 has once again come under 
						the media spotlight. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn1">1</a>)&nbsp; The 
						publication of the <i>Foreign Relations of the United 
						States, XI</i> (FRUS XI) and its companion electronic 
						volume, <i>Foreign Relations, 1969–1976, volume E-7, 
						Documents on South Asia, 1969–1972</i> &nbsp;(<a href="#fn2">2</a>)&nbsp; 
						has rekindled interest on what Henry Kissinger, the 
						former National Security advisor to US president Richard 
						Nixon, described as “perhaps the most complex issue in 
						Nixon's first term.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn3">3</a>)&nbsp; FRUS XI &nbsp;(<a href="#fn4">4</a>)&nbsp; 
						contains annotated declassified documents related to the 
						events in 1971, especially between March and December 
						while the companion electronic volume covers a 
						three-year period and documents US policies towards 
						Afghanistan, in addition to India, Pakistan, and 
						Bangladesh. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn5">5</a>)&nbsp; Although the 
						documents in the FRUS XI provide very little new 
						information in regard to the US policies towards the 
						crisis in general, they are important in two ways. 
						Firstly, they have confirmed that a combination of 
						Nixon's emotional attachment to General Yahya, his 
						dislike for Indira Gandhi, Pakistan's role as a conduit 
						of rapprochement with China and Kissinger's predilection 
						for power politics and focus on geopolitical concerns 
						greatly influenced the American policy decision in 1971. 
						These points have been emphasized previously by 
						historians and analysts such as William Van Hollen, &nbsp;(<a href="#fn6">6</a>)&nbsp; 
						Dennis Kux, &nbsp;(<a href="#fn7">7</a>)&nbsp; Raymond Garthoff, 
						&nbsp;(<a href="#fn8">8</a>)&nbsp; William Bundy, &nbsp;(<a href="#fn9">9</a>)&nbsp; 
						and Jussi Hanhimaki. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn10">10</a>)&nbsp; These 
						newly declassified documents provide confirmation to 
						their analyses. Secondly, the documents suggest that the 
						US administration showed more than a “tilt” towards 
						Pakistan: it has tried to dissipate the Bangladesh 
						movement. It also provides evidence of a direct contact 
						with the Bangladesh government-in-exile in 1971 and two 
						other initiatives to bring about a “political solution” 
						to the on-going crisis. This aspect of the US policy 
						has, to date, received little attention of the analysts 
						of US foreign policy and sadly, the South Asian 
						historiography has ignored it. In this article I will 
						focus on these three efforts drawing on the documents in 
						the FRUS XI, other declassified documents available at 
						the US National Archives, and the Bangladeshi sources 
						including interviews of people involved in the 
						Bangladesh war of independence in 1971.</p>
						<p align="justify">It is the contention of this article 
						that the primary objectives of the US efforts to bring 
						the resistance leaders (i.e. “representatives” of the 
						Bangladesh government-in-exile who were fighting to 
						establish an independent country in the eastern province 
						of Pakistan) and the Pakistani administration to the 
						table, were to maintain the territorial integrity of 
						Pakistan and create a rift within the Bangladesh 
						movement which would eventually dissipate the movement 
						altogether. This paper explores the nature and the 
						consequences of these efforts, and insists that these 
						initiatives, especially the clandestine contacts with 
						some of the leaders of the Bangladesh 
						government-in-exile between June and October, deserve 
						closer examination.</p>
						<p align="justify">The article is divided into six 
						sections. The second section provides the background of 
						the crisis that emerged in early 1971; the third section 
						discusses, in broad strokes, US policy towards the 
						crisis, and the fourth section examines in detail the 
						three different US attempts, described as a “political 
						settlement” in US documents. The clandestine contacts 
						between the US and the Bangladesh government-in-exile in 
						Calcutta are discussed in details as these were the most 
						elaborate and influential of the efforts made. The fifth 
						section of the paper examines the objectives of these 
						initiatives while the sixth section provides concluding 
						remarks.</p>
						<h4>The background</h4>
						<p align="justify">The crisis in South Asia was a result 
						of a series of events that began in March 1971 rooted in 
						the domestic politics of Pakistan, then ruled by General 
						Yahya Khan. Although the Awami League (AL), a centrist 
						political party of the ethnic Bengali population led by 
						Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib), secured a landslide 
						victory in the general election held in December 1970, 
						Yahya Khan postponed the inaugural session of the 
						parliament scheduled on March 3, 1971 at the insistence 
						of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the head of the Pakistan 
						People's Party (PPP), who emerged as the leader of the 
						minority party. Widespread street agitation throughout 
						East Pakistan ensued resulting in the total collapse of 
						control of Pakistani authorities over the civilian 
						administration in the East. The AL launched what they 
						described as, the “non-cooperation” movement. However, 
						there were growing demands from a large section of the 
						populace to declare an independent Bangladesh. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn11">11</a>)&nbsp; 
						In the middle of the month, intense negotiations between 
						Mujib, Yahya, and Bhutto began in Dhaka for a peaceful 
						solution. At the same time, thousands of soldiers from 
						the West Pakistan were deployed to the East.</p>
						<p align="justify">More than a week of closed-door 
						negotiations came to a halt on the evening of March 25 
						as President Yahya secretly left Dhaka, having ordered a 
						military crackdown. That night the military unleashed a 
						reign of terror – hundreds of thousands of innocent 
						civilians, activists, and teachers of Dhaka University 
						were killed as were Bengali members of the para-military 
						force (EPR) and police. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the 
						leader of the majority party, was taken into custody and 
						soon described by President Yahya Khan as the “traitor.” 
						Before being arrested Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared 
						independence and called upon Bengalis to take up arms 
						and fight the Pakistani Army until the “nation is 
						freed.”</p>
						<p align="justify">The bloodbath, which continued over 
						the following days throughout the entire country, forced 
						hundreds of thousands of people to cross the border into 
						neighboring India. Small contingents of Bengali members 
						of the Pakistani Army, stationed in various parts of the 
						country, mounted initial resistance. But they were no 
						match for the Pakistani military. The leaders of the AL 
						fled to India, established the Bangladesh 
						government-in-exile on April 17, and organized guerrilla 
						groups with the help of India to continue the war.</p>
						<p align="justify">As spring rolled into summer, the 
						indiscriminate killings reached genocidal proportions, 
						and the number of refugees from East Pakistan climbed to 
						millions. The genocide also helped the resistance 
						movement gain considerable strength. Despite the claim 
						of the Pakistani government that “normalcy” had 
						returned, the details of indiscriminate killings by the 
						Pakistani army continued appearing in the international 
						press and showed that the war was far from over. 
						Condemnation of the atrocities and calls for a just 
						solution grew louder by the day. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn12">12</a>)&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p align="justify">By the summer of 1971 the Bangladesh 
						government-in-exile was steering the resistance war, 
						Indian policy-makers were clearly in favor of 
						establishing an independent Bangladesh, and the 
						Pakistani regime was trying to portray the movement as 
						an Indian ploy to dismember Pakistan.· The US 
						initiatives to frustrate the Bangladesh Movement took 
						place during this period. The resistance movement, 
						however, continued throughout the fall leading to the 
						war between India and Pakistan in December 1971. In 
						response to the Pakistani attacks on the Western front 
						on December 3, India began its operation in the East, 
						created a joint command with the Bengali guerrillas, and 
						forced 93,000 Pakistani soldiers to surrender on 
						December 16. Thus an independent Bangladesh state came 
						into being.</p>
						<h4>US policy towards the Bangladesh Movement</h4>
						<p align="justify">Since the election of 1970, the US 
						administration, like many others, was aware that a 
						compromise solution was almost impossible, &nbsp;(<a href="#fn13">13</a>)&nbsp; 
						and thus the secession of East was already on the 
						horizon. The National Security Study Memorandum 109 of 
						December 19, 1970, &nbsp;(<a href="#fn14">14</a>)&nbsp; 
						Kissinger's memo to the President on February 22 and 
						Secretary of State William Rogers’ memorandum to the 
						President on February 23 &nbsp;(<a href="#fn15">15</a>)&nbsp; all 
						bear testimony to the fact that even before March 1 it 
						was clear to the US administration that the break-up of 
						Pakistan was merely a matter of time. The telegram of 
						Consul General Archer Blood from Dhaka on December 30, 
						1970 also provided clear indications as to where events 
						were heading. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn16">16</a>)&nbsp; Furthermore, 
						the AL leaders, including Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, sought 
						US help in resolving the constitutional deadlock. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn17">17</a>)&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p align="justify">The US administration's position was, 
						at least on paper, to maintain neutrality. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn18">18</a>)&nbsp; 
						After the military crackdown on March 25, the policy, 
						however, was of inaction. Kissinger communicated that to 
						the Washington Special Action Group (WSAG) meeting on 
						March 26: “I have talked to the President briefly before 
						lunch.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He doesn't want to do anything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;He 
						does not favor an active policy.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn19">19</a>)&nbsp; 
						Maintaining the status quo at a critical juncture like 
						this was in essence equivalent to condoning the 
						atrocities. The President, although not in favor of 
						supporting the action, said in a telephone conversation 
						with Kissinger on March 28 that “we are not going to 
						condemn it.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn20">20</a>)&nbsp; Almost a month 
						after the atrocities began and long after a clearer 
						picture emerged from the ground – on April 28, 1971 – 
						Kissinger put before President Nixon his evaluation of 
						the situation &nbsp;(<a href="#fn21">21</a>)&nbsp; and policy 
						recommendations. This memorandum was written after 
						Consul General Archer Blood's telegrams from Dhaka to 
						the State Department with details of the atrocities 
						(telegram 959 – March 28; &nbsp;(<a href="#fn22">22</a>)&nbsp; 
						telegram 978 – March 29; &nbsp;(<a href="#fn23">23</a>)&nbsp; 
						telegram 986 – March 30 &nbsp;(<a href="#fn24">24</a>)&nbsp; ) and 
						a petition by 20 Consular officials from Dhaka and 
						supported by nine specialists on South Asian Affairs 
						from Washington criticizing the US policies were 
						received and discussed. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn25">25</a>)&nbsp; 
						Joseph Farland, US Ambassador in Islamabad, in his 
						initial reactions to events also concurred with Archer 
						Blood that “Yahya's short-term action has probably made 
						inevitable the thing he is ostensibly seeking to prevent 
						in the long-term: the disintegration of Pakistan.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn26">26</a>)&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p align="justify">Kissinger's memorandum to the 
						President not only codified the policies the 
						administration had been following since the crisis 
						erupted, but also became the guide which the 
						administration followed to the letter until December 16, 
						1971. Although Kissinger acknowledged in the Washington 
						Special Action Group (WSAG) meeting on March 26 that the 
						independence of Bangladesh was inevitable, he saw three 
						options:</p>
						<i>
						<p align="justify">Option 1 would be essentially a 
						posture of supporting whatever political and military 
						program President Yahya chooses to pursue in the East.</p>
						<p align="justify">Option 2 would be to try and maintain 
						a posture of genuine neutrality.</p>
						<p align="justify">Option 3 would be to make a serious 
						effort to help Yahya end the war and establish an 
						arrangement that could be transitional to East Pakistan 
						autonomy.</p>
						</i>
						<p align="justify">Kissinger spelt out the steps needed 
						to be taken for each of the options, and recommended 
						that the US government go with Option 3, because,</p>
						<i>
						<p align="justify">Option 3 would have the advantage of 
						making the most of the relationship with Yahya while 
						engaging in a serious effort to move the situation 
						towards conditions less damaging to US and Pakistani 
						interests. Its disadvantage is that it might lead to a 
						situation in which progress toward a political 
						settlement [breaks] down, the US [alienates] itself from 
						the 600 million people in India and East Pakistan, and 
						the US [is] unable to influence the West Pakistan 
						government to make the concessions necessary for a 
						political settlement.</p>
						</i>
						<p align="justify">President Richard Nixon's response to 
						Kissinger's comprehensive six-page briefing was a 
						hand-written, signed note, attached to the briefing 
						itself. Marked “To All Hands,” the US president summed 
						up official policy in six simple words: “Don't squeeze 
						Yahya at this time.” President Nixon underlined the word 
						“Don't” thrice, just in case anyone failed to get the 
						message. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn27">27</a>)&nbsp; Thus by the end of 
						April the US administration, especially the White House, 
						had formulated its policy towards the Bangladesh 
						movement – not to support it; instead, to stand by its 
						longtime ally, Pakistan.</p>
						<p align="justify">The date of Kissinger's memo – April 
						28 – is noteworthy for another reason. It was written 
						the day after the Pakistani envoy Agha Hilaly conveyed a 
						message from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in which “Zhou 
						confirmed Chinese willingness to receive a secret US 
						envoy.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn28">28</a>)&nbsp; Pakistan was chosen 
						not only to be the conduit of the message but also to 
						organize the logistics and modalities of the visit. 
						Although Islamabad was not the only route to Peking for 
						the US administration, &nbsp;(<a href="#fn29">29</a>)&nbsp; it 
						became the principal justification for favoring 
						Pakistan, at the expense of the cherished principles of 
						democracy and human rights. At a time “when principles 
						[could] make best politics,” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn30">30</a>)&nbsp; 
						the White House chose to shun the principles.</p>
						<h4>Political settlement</h4>
						<p align="justify">The option that the White House had 
						chosen to pursue called for a political settlement of 
						the crisis. Implicit in this option was maintaining the 
						“territorial integrity of Pakistan” as the primary 
						consideration. The possibility of “working with both 
						sides at once” was brushed aside in an NSC meeting in 
						early April. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn31">31</a>)&nbsp; This policy 
						option, therefore, precluded the possibility of 
						acknowledging the existence of, or official contacts 
						with, the “Bangladesh government in exile” in Calcutta. 
						By summer, the inefficacy of this policy was obvious to 
						any observer. Career diplomats and analysts tried, in 
						vain, to bring the White House, especially Kissinger, 
						into line. The situation on the ground was changing 
						rapidly as guerrillas emerged as a fighting force to be 
						reckoned with. The “independence” of Bangladesh was no 
						longer a pipedream, but became an imminent reality. In 
						the face of strong criticisms at home and abroad, the 
						White House devised ways to frustrate these 
						developments, and embarked on a number of efforts to 
						prolong the conflict which would provide Yahya Khan with 
						a breathing space. One of the primary objectives of 
						these efforts was to create a rift within the Bangladesh 
						movement. Among these efforts, three deserve closer 
						examination. They are: the Calcutta contacts, the 
						Islamabad talk, and the Tehran initiatives.</p>
						<h4>I. &nbsp; The Calcutta contacts</h4>
						<p align="justify">The Calcutta contacts, according to 
						Kissinger's account, started very modestly on July 30 
						when Qazi Zahirul Quayum, an elected member of the AL, 
						approached the consulate as a representative of the 
						government in exile to begin negotiations. “This led to 
						a futile three-month pursuit of political 
						accommodation,” Kissinger insists, “that could have 
						amounted to something if India and the Bengalis had 
						wanted.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn32">32</a>)&nbsp; Some leaders of the 
						Bangladesh movement claim that the initial contacts were 
						made in late June. The initiative, it is assumed, came 
						from the US Consulate rather than Quayum. Awami League 
						sources interviewed in 1995 claim that in the wake of 
						the first meeting of the elected AL leaders on July 6 in 
						Shiliguri, Griffin, and others contacted Quayum for 
						inside information. These contacts marked a clear 
						departure from the official US policy that the 
						developments in East Pakistan were internal matters of 
						Pakistan and the US had no intention of getting 
						involved. It is also worth mentioning that US officials 
						had previously refused to meet any Bangladesh 
						representatives. As early as April 13 a representative 
						of the AL contacted the Consulate through the British 
						Deputy High Commissioner for a meeting. The 
						representative indicated that Tajuddin Ahmed, the Prime 
						Minister of the Bangladesh government-in-exile, was 
						interested to meet with US officials. While the British 
						officials did meet Ahmed, the consulate was instructed 
						by the State Department not to entertain such requests. 
						&nbsp;(<a href="#fn33">33</a>)&nbsp; Yet, in late-July, an AL 
						leader whose authenticity was not clearly established 
						was received by the Consulate and approval was given by 
						the White House for continuing the contacts. It was 
						definitely not due to any change of policy but, in 
						retrospect, one can see, was designed to buy time for 
						the Pakistani regime. Kissinger, who believed that 
						asking Yahya “to deal with the Awami Leaguers in 
						Calcutta is like asking Abraham Lincoln to deal with 
						Jefferson Davis,” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn34">34</a>)&nbsp; provided a 
						green signal to the contacts and asked Joseph Farland to 
						keep Yahya posted as to developments.</p>
						<p align="justify">The records show that over the 
						following three months at least 13 meetings took place 
						between George Griffin, the political officer of the 
						Consulate and Qazi Zahirul Quayum. Quayum requested that 
						these contacts be handled “discreetly.” He also insisted 
						that a significant section of the AL leaders were 
						seeking a political solution to the problem and were 
						prepared to back down on the demand for total 
						independence. The continued contacts with the Bangladesh 
						(BD) representative yielded very little progress in 
						terms of resolving the crisis, but were maintained with 
						the utmost secrecy, so much so that they remained 
						unknown to Ambassador Kenneth Keating in New Delhi. 
						Interestingly the suggestion of keeping Keating and the 
						Delhi embassy in the dark came from Ambassador Joseph 
						Farland stationed in Islamabad.</p>
						<p align="justify">Perhaps the highest point of these 
						clandestine contacts was the 90-minute meeting between 
						the Bangladesh Foreign Minister Khondoker Mushtaq Ahmed 
						and the Political Officer of the Consulate on September 
						28. During the meeting Mushtaq described himself as a 
						“dedicated anti-communist,” expressed his 
						dissatisfaction with the recent actions of the 
						government in exile, reminded his listeners that the 
						United States was an “old and good friend” and said, “we 
						want your shoulder to lean on.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn35">35</a>)&nbsp; 
						There had been a number of meetings with Qayum and the 
						Political Officer of the consulate insisted that Quayum 
						arrange a meeting with the Acting President, Nazrul 
						Islam. But it appeared to the Consulate that Islam was 
						reluctant to see any US officials. A direct invitation 
						was also rejected. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn36">36</a>)&nbsp; </p>
						<p align="justify">In the following month, the 
						possibility of any “political settlement” through 
						Calcutta contacts evaporated. The Prime Minister of the 
						government in exile was apprised of these clandestine 
						contacts. This became clear in a meeting between the 
						Bangladesh High Commissioner in Calcutta Hossain Ali and 
						Griffin on October 12 where Ali expressed his 
						displeasure that the US had not communicated the 
						Bangladesh “desires” to Yahya. Further, he questioned 
						the utility of talks with Yahya, and why Yahya was not 
						meeting Mujib. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn37">37</a>)&nbsp; </p>
						<p align="justify">The news of these contacts became 
						public on October 24. Almost all newspapers in Calcutta 
						carried an Associated Press story filed from London 
						quoting “Asian diplomatic sources” that the “USG [United 
						States Government] has established informal contacts 
						with Bangladesh leaders in an effort to promote 
						negotiations between them and GOP [Government of 
						Pakistan].” Denials from the Bangla Desh Government (BDG) 
						followed immediately. It was in this context, that the 
						Calcutta consulate informed the State Department in a 
						telegram on October 28 that “Calcutta contact at least 
						at level and along lines so far employed has reached a 
						dead end and that new approach is desirable.” The 
						telegram went on to state that,</p>
						<i>
						<p align="justify">We do not see any sign or hope of any 
						BDG [Bangla Desh Government] representative being 
						prepared to risk any compromising his position in BD 
						movement by initiating negotiations. Whatever may have 
						been the factors and personalities behind the original 
						Qaiyum's initiative, changes in the situation which have 
						occurred since July (i.e., increased Mukti Bahini 
						activity, GOI [Government of India]-GOP [Government of 
						Pakistan] tension, or growing leftist pressure within 
						BD) have tended to sharply limit the maneuverability of 
						any BDG leader. As far as we can see here, if 
						negotiations are eventually to get under way, next move 
						is up to Yahya. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn38">38</a>)&nbsp; </p>
						</i>
						<p align="justify">The fallout of these contacts became 
						further clear on the following day. As reported in the
						<i>Ananada Bazar Patrika</i> published from Calcutta, 
						the AL working committee instructed all MNAs (i.e. 
						members of parliament) to refrain from talking to 
						“foreign representatives, particularly American 
						representatives, on the future of Bangladesh,” and 
						warned members of “stern disciplinary measures” for 
						violating the instruction. The committee decisions 
						included an announcement that the party would agree to 
						“no settlement short of independence.” The simmering 
						discontent regarding the leadership was dealt a body 
						blow with the words “there is no need of changing the AL 
						leadership now.”</p>
						<p align="justify">Quayum, however, maintained the 
						contact with the consulate and called on Griffin three 
						times in November to keep him posted as to developments. 
						He alleged that D. P. Dhar, the Indian official in 
						charge of maintaining liaison with the Bangladesh 
						Government had described Mushtaq as a “traitor” during a 
						heated conversation. He pleaded that the US 
						administration intervene to release Mujib (even if his 
						mobility was restricted to West Pakistan) because, he 
						reported, the moderates were coming under pressure from 
						the leftists, pro-Russian communists and the Soviets and 
						“without Sheikh we cannot stand up to pressure much 
						longer.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn39">39</a>)&nbsp; </p>
						<h4>II. The Islamabad talk</h4>
						<p align="justify">Concurrent to cultivating the 
						Calcutta contacts, another channel for a “political 
						settlement” was opened in late October. This involved 
						members of the AL who remained within Pakistan and was 
						“cleared” by the Pakistani government on August 7. The 
						“cleared” list contained 88 names. The groundwork for 
						this option began in late July. In the Senior Review 
						Group (SRG) meeting on July 23, as mentioned before, the 
						“political solution” became a major issue of discussion 
						and different options were considered. Kissinger 
						sarcastically commented that “Yahya and his group would 
						never win any prizes for high IQs or for subtlety of 
						their political comprehension” and asked “can we get a 
						program that separates the refugee issue while still 
						leaving a vista for political accommodation?” He also 
						opined that “the Pakistanis don't have the political 
						imagination to do this themselves.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn40">40</a>)&nbsp; 
						Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia and Near 
						East Joseph Sisco insisted that the US will “have to 
						nudge Yahya toward the Awami League.” Sisco also 
						emphasized the importance of Mujib saying that “we also 
						have to do what we can to see that he does not try Mujib.” 
						It was at that point that the Under Secretary for State 
						John Irwin introduced the option of dealing with those 
						AL leaders who were in Pakistan. Irwin asked “are there 
						any Awami Leaguers left in East Pakistan that Yahya 
						could deal with?” and then proposed that “it would help 
						if he could find a few Awami Leaguers who still had some 
						respect in East Pakistan with whom he could deal.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn41">41</a>)&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p align="justify">Within seven days of this discussion 
						the “cleared” list was announced. Not all the “cleared” 
						members were in Pakistan at that time and willing to 
						take advantage of this announcement. Those who 
						identified and contacted the military authorities were 
						given protection. One of these cleared and “protected” 
						members – Nurul Islam – offered to become the mediator 
						in talks between Mujibur Rahman and the Pakistani 
						authority. The proposal was put to US Consul General in 
						Dhaka Herbert Spivack, who had replaced Archer Blood a 
						month earlier. Islam and another member, S. B. Zaman, 
						were cultivated by the Dhaka Consulate and the Islamabad 
						Embassy. The meeting was scheduled through the Islamabad 
						Embassy &nbsp;(<a href="#fn42">42</a>)&nbsp; and the President was 
						kept informed about the meeting as this was included in 
						his Thursday briefing on November 17 where the group was 
						described as “tame Awami Leaguers.” A meeting between 
						President Yahya Khan and these two AL members took place 
						on November 22. The details that emerged from Islamabad 
						Embassy's telegram on November 24 show that Islam and 
						Zaman proposed a four-point solution. The four-point 
						proposal of Nurul Islam and S. B. Zaman was surprisingly 
						similar to the proposal of Quayum. None insisted on the
						<i>immediate</i> release of Mujib and a direct 
						negotiation between Yahya and Mujib. Instead, the Islam-Zaman 
						duo suggested that they talk to Mujib and then travel to 
						Calcutta for a further discussion with Tajuddin Ahmed. 
						&nbsp;(<a href="#fn43">43</a>)&nbsp; Although these proposals were 
						a non-starter and there was very little hope that this 
						would bring any solution to the crisis, Yahya Khan was 
						in no mood to go beyond listening to ideas either. 
						Furthermore, by November the situation on the ground had 
						changed dramatically – the Calcutta contacts had ended 
						in fiasco, the Indians had reigned in the group in favor 
						of such contacts, the infighting within the AL had begun 
						to subside and the Bangladeshi fighters were advancing 
						rapidly.</p>
						<h4>III. The Tehran initiative</h4>
						<p align="justify">The Tehran initiative – an effort to 
						arrange a meeting between the Bangladesh representatives 
						and GOP representatives – came to light in the meeting 
						of the Senior Review Group on July 30. The meeting was a 
						continuation of the earlier meeting of July 23 when the 
						need for a political solution to the crisis had been 
						emphasized by a number of participants. It was also 
						noted in the context of a possible relief operation 
						inside Bangladesh that “the Pakistani Army is very 
						thinly stretched. They are extremely short of transport” 
						(USDS 2005: 279). Richard Helms of the CIA floated the 
						idea saying, “Has anyone given any thought to involving 
						the Shah of Iran in working with Pakistan? He might be 
						able to help us; at least it's worth considering since 
						we seem to have [run] out of gas with Pakistan.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn44">44</a>)&nbsp; 
						Helms's point was immediately contradicted by Kissinger 
						saying that “we are not out of gas with Yahya”; however 
						Kissinger did not oppose the idea of involving the Shah 
						of Iran. The idea was to have a meeting between some of 
						the exiled AL leaders and GOP representatives in Tehran. 
						This offer seems to have made no headway. Although the 
						Shah agreed to host such a clandestine meeting, it 
						received very little support from the Pakistani and 
						Bangladeshi sides. Sisson and Rose (1990) provide a 
						different narrative of the origin of this initiative. 
						Their account, based on a Pakistani source, contends 
						that the initiative came from the Pakistani government. 
						Sisson and Rose writes, “According to one Pakistani 
						source close to Yahya in 1971, Yahya was prepared to 
						have Mujib included in negotiations with the Awami 
						League and even asked the shah of Iran to assist in the 
						negotiation of a political solution with the Awami 
						League during Yahya's visit to Tehran in September.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn45">45</a>)&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p align="justify">Nonetheless, this soon became known 
						to the exiled leaders in India. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn46">46</a>)&nbsp; 
						Quyaum, the Calcutta contact, came to know about the 
						move and mentioned it to the Consulate officials as 
						reported by Calcutta Consulate to the State Department 
						in a telegram on August 28. The details of the effort 
						are still lacking but it obviously remained alive until 
						October. In Secretary Alexis Johnson's telegram to 
						Islamabad Embassy on October 8, there contained a 
						section for Tehran which instructed the Ambassador to 
						solicit the Shah's support in obtaining a political 
						settlement. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn47">47</a>)&nbsp; But by then the 
						Shah had already made the point that a political 
						solution was the only way out for Pakistan. In early 
						October, the Shah, in a meeting with Yahya Khan, 
						“pressed him strongly to reach a political solution.” 
						Van Hollen reported to WSAG on October 7 that “the Shah 
						urged Yahya to cut losses, told him frankly that he 
						didn't have a chance in military showdown and urged him 
						to seek a political settlement.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn48">48</a>)&nbsp; 
						In Johnson's view, that was a “positive development” as 
						someone has been bringing the message home to Yahya. 
						Subsequent developments, especially the sudden collapse 
						of the Calcutta effort, seem to have taken the steam out 
						of this effort. US documents, available to date, make no 
						mention of this effort after October 8.</p>
						<h4>The goals of the “initiatives”</h4>
						<p align="justify">These initiatives, especially the 
						latter two, was evidently too little and too late. Yet 
						one can ask what the intended outcomes of these 
						initiatives were? If we are to believe Kissinger's 1979 
						account, the objectives of all these initiatives were to 
						establish a civilian government in Pakistan, securing 
						the release of Mujib, ensuring autonomy in the short 
						term, and independent Bangladesh “in a matter of 
						months.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn49">49</a>)&nbsp; But if we are to 
						believe Kissinger's 1971 account, “the time required to 
						bring about a political evolution&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;might be longer 
						than the Indian capacity to withstand the pressures by 
						the refugees.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn50">50</a>)&nbsp; Anyone 
						following the events would agree with Kissinger's 1971 
						account and would reach a conclusion similar to that of 
						Hersh “at this point, only Nixon and Kissinger believed 
						there was any chance of a negotiated settlement between 
						Yahya Khan and the Bengalis. During the fall, the Awami 
						League had escalated its demands as well as guerrilla 
						activities against the West Pakistani Army, and nothing 
						short of total independence for Bangladesh was 
						negotiable.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn51">51</a>)&nbsp; </p>
						<p align="justify">Kissinger's 1979 account gives the 
						impression that the US had a solution package in hand 
						and was ready to press upon the parties including 
						Pakistan. But Oldenburg, who interviewed State 
						Department officials, writes, “several interviewees 
						agreed that no ‘political solution’ was pressed upon 
						Pakistan until very late, and none could say what the 
						solution was. If indeed it was formulated as a package 
						by the White House, it was not certainly presented as 
						such to the State Department.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn52">52</a>)&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p align="justify">The Calcutta contacts were not moving 
						events towards any negotiated settlement, as there were 
						no positive responses from the other party – Pakistan. 
						Kissinger's own admission bears out the point. 
						Kissinger, in response to the questions by the Congress 
						on December 7, 1971, stated that the negotiations never 
						began, nor was the U.S. ever involved “on substance.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn53">53</a>)&nbsp; 
						Additionally, President Nixon, in his State of the World 
						Message to the Congress on 9 February 1972 acknowledged, 
						“the United States cannot be certain that the steps it 
						proposed would have brought about a negotiation, or that 
						such a negotiation would have produced a settlement.”</p>
						<p align="justify">Had the intention been to move 
						towards a solution, other channels in India would have 
						been explored. But on the contrary, Ambassador Keating 
						in Delhi was discouraged from contacting any Bangladeshi 
						officials even when the Foreign Secretary of the BDG, 
						Mahbub Alam approached him in August. Interestingly, 
						Mahbub Alam belonged to the same group as Quayum and 
						Mushtaq Ahmed.</p>
						<p align="justify">These initiatives were, therefore, 
						“sterile exercises” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn54">54</a>)&nbsp; in terms 
						of bringing about a positive solution to the crisis, but 
						served to accentuate schisms within the leadership of 
						the Bangladesh movement. The clandestine effort in 
						Calcutta is the clearest example of this.</p>
						<p align="justify">As the AL, from its inception, had 
						attempted to represent a broad range of social groups, 
						cleavages within the organization always existed. Events 
						prior to, and after the crackdown of March 25 
						accentuated divisions within the party and brought forth 
						some new elements conducive to factionalism. In 1971, 
						there were at least three factions within the AL: first, 
						the radical elements; second, the liberals; and third, 
						the conservatives.</p>
						<p align="justify">The liberal faction of the party 
						under the leadership of Tajuddin Ahmed, took the lead in 
						forming the government in early April. Ahmed, prodded by 
						his close aides, presented himself as the Prime Minister 
						of the Bangladesh government led by Mujib, in his 
						meeting with Indira Gandhi on April 3. Ahmed didn't know 
						the whereabouts of his colleagues and thus made the 
						decision without any consultation with other leaders. 
						This became the first issue of contention within the 
						party when Ahmed assembled the small group of leaders 
						five days later in Calcutta. Both radicals and 
						conservatives were up in arms against Ahmed. When 
						Tajuddin Ahmed and a few other leaders met Khondker 
						Mushtaq Ahmed, a senior leader of conservative 
						inclination, on April 11, Mushtaq expressed discontent 
						that Tajuddin had become Prime Minister. He argued that 
						as the senior member of the team he should have taken 
						the top job. He also expressed his desire to leave the 
						country and go to Mecca for the rest of his life.</p>
						<p align="justify">With the formal declaration of 
						independence and the formation of a cabinet on April 17, 
						the conflict subsided but did not end. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn55">55</a>)&nbsp; 
						Disagreements resurfaced when the AL members of the 
						National and Provincial Assemblies met in Shiliguri (Agaratala 
						district of India) on July 5–6, 1971. Recollections of 
						the participants paint a picture of a cacophonous 
						meeting attended by about 300 elected representatives of 
						the AL. The meeting became a show of force by various 
						groups within the party, and a large number of 
						participants, including Mushtaq Ahmed, expressed 
						discontent regarding the leadership, particularly the PM 
						for his inability to gain concrete support from the 
						Indian authorities. Some of the participants said that 
						it would be better if they returned to Bangladesh to 
						fight against or to compromise with the Pakistani 
						regime. It was this view that received not-so-tacit 
						support from the Calcutta consulate.</p>
						<p align="justify">The signing of the Indo-Soviet treaty 
						on August 9 provided a clear signal that Indian 
						policy-makers were moving towards a situation where they 
						would not remain friendless if attacked by Pakistan 
						and/or China. While liberals welcomed this development, 
						it caused significant discomfort to the conservatives 
						within the AL. They viewed this as the consolidation of 
						Indo-Soviet power and became concerned that this would 
						strengthen the position of the liberals within the 
						government, and therefore would be damaging to the 
						conservatives’ design. Their fear was further 
						intensified when the Indian authority reiterated that to 
						strengthen the movement, a national alliance 
						incorporating pro-Moscow political parties should be 
						formed immediately. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn56">56</a>)&nbsp; It was 
						immensely difficult for the conservatives to oppose such 
						a move. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn57">57</a>)&nbsp; But a very emotive 
						issue emerged that provided them with the much needed 
						opportunity to oppose the government position – saving 
						the life of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p>
						<p align="justify">A day after the treaty was signed, a 
						court began try Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in secret for 
						waging war against Pakistan. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn58">58</a>)&nbsp; 
						The verdict of the trial was a forgone conclusion, 
						especially after Yahya's speech of March 26 and June 28 
						as well as his comment on August 5 that Mujib would be 
						“punished” for “treason”. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn59">59</a>)&nbsp; 
						Several countries appealed to Pakistan to spare Mujib's 
						life, but President Nixon in the SRG meeting on August 
						11 asked the State Department to remain “neutral” while 
						Farland communicated to Yahya the US “suggestion” that 
						“he should not shoot Mujib.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn60">60</a>)&nbsp; 
						The Mushtaq faction within the AL leadership began 
						insisting that the only way to save Mujib's life was to 
						deal with the Pakistani government directly. They 
						contended that it was an “either / or” situation between 
						the “independent Bangladesh” and “Mujib's life.” The 
						official stance of the Bangladesh government was that 
						anything short of independence would jeopardize the 
						Mujib's life. Mujib was the symbol of the Bangladesh 
						movement and his execution would not only damage the 
						cause but also split the leadership in as many groups. 
						Thus, on the face of it, the call for saving the life of 
						Mujib was very appealing. The Mushatq faction alleged 
						that the Tajuddin faction was averse to the idea of 
						saving Mujib's life because they wanted to remain in 
						power. This caused a stir in the exiled community and 
						placed many dedicated supporters of Mujib in a serious 
						dilemma. At this stage the Mushtaq faction drew up an 
						elaborate plan of defection. The plan was that saving 
						Mujib's life would be the pretext for breaking ranks and 
						returning to Pakistan. The moment chosen for this was 
						October 1971 and the venue would be the United Nations. 
						Mushtaq Ahmed, as Foreign Minister of the 
						government-in-exile, was expected to be in New York to 
						attend the United Nations General Assembly to present 
						the Bangladesh case. The plan was to announce a 
						compromise deal with the Pakistani administration short 
						of independence, and thus cause serious damage to, if 
						not a complete dissolution of, the Bangladesh movement. 
						This, needless to say, neatly fitted into the “political 
						settlement” scheme the Nixon White House was advocating. 
						To divert the government's attention from their 
						clandestine contacts with the US, the Mushtaq faction 
						organized a series of regional meetings to criticize the 
						Tajuddin administration. &nbsp;(<a href="#fn61">61</a>)&nbsp; This 
						move made the division within the AL leadership an open 
						secret. When the Consulate General in Calcutta on 
						September 20 reported of division within the leadership, 
						&nbsp;(<a href="#fn62">62</a>)&nbsp; this was not only on whether 
						to meet the representatives of the US government, as the 
						telegram suggested, but more on how to deal with the 
						situation that emerged from this open rebellion of the 
						Mushtaq faction. The news of the on-going trial of Mujib, 
						which resumed on September 5, and the rumor that there 
						had been a verdict to execute Mujib made the situation 
						worse for the Bangladesh government.</p>
						<p align="justify">The above description of the 
						intrigues within the leadership shows that there was a 
						convergence of interest between a faction of the AL 
						leadership and the White House. The telegram from the 
						Secretary of State to the Embassy in Pakistan on August 
						31 asking for comments on, among other things, the 
						“dynamics of troublesome divisions within BD movement 
						(including Mukti Bahini) over ‘independence vs. 
						accommodation’” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn63">63</a>)&nbsp; demonstrates 
						that the US administration was hoping that this division 
						would bear some fruit. The Calcutta initiative, 
						therefore, was not a “sterile exercise” from this 
						vantage point. It made some contributions, unfortunately 
						not in the direction of ameliorating the sufferings of 
						the Bengalis.</p>
						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p align="justify">This discussion show that the US 
						policy towards the South Asian crisis in 1971 was not 
						limited to the much discussed “tilt” in favor of 
						Pakistan, but also actively in opposition to the 
						independence of Bangladesh, despite the fact that the 
						key architect of this policy, Henry Kissinger, was 
						convinced that “East Pakistan will eventually become 
						independent.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn64">64</a>)&nbsp; A definitive 
						answer to the question of whether this opposition was to 
						buy time for the United States to complete its 
						rapprochement with China or provide Yahya Khan the 
						opportunity to save Pakistan can only be provided by 
						those who were engaged in the process.</p>
						<p align="justify">But the available documents and the 
						basic reality tells us that these efforts began 
						weakening the Bangladesh movement and could have 
						contributed to its demise should the process have 
						continued for long. On the other hand, these provided 
						Yahya with an impression that the US administration had 
						come to rescue him and that the resolution of the crisis 
						was only a matter of time. The mindset of Yahya can be 
						understood from the comment of G. W. Choudhury, the 
						former Information Minister and a close aide of Yahya, 
						“If Nixon had not given him [the] false hope, he'd have 
						been more realistic.” Choudhury noted that the decision 
						of military crackdown in March was Yahya's own, “but 
						there was hope that the United States would bail him out 
						if he did something stupid.” &nbsp;(<a href="#fn65">65</a>)&nbsp; 
						The “political settlement” efforts of the United States 
						were thus seen from Islamabad's vantage point as the 
						rescue mission. There was no need for them to hold back 
						on the military side. Consequently, the military 
						continued the atrocities – more deaths and destruction 
						followed. US clandestine efforts, described as a 
						“political settlement,” therefore, contributed to the 
						bloodshed instead of bringing an end to it.</p>

						Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs insists that the 
						“tilt” policy of the Nixon administration had been in 
						place even before March 25. He noted that Kissinger in 
						the SRG meeting on March 6 commented on a “special 
						relationship” between Nixon and Yahya (Van Hollen, “Tilt 
						Policy”, pp.&nbsp;423–4). Nixon's pro-Pakistani bent was 
						evident in his article in <i>Foreign Affairs</i> in 
						1967. The article entitled “Asia after Vietnam” 
						described Pakistan as “India's more successful 
						neighbor.” When he assumed office he saw India as a huge 
						country “both challenging and frustrating.” Nixon cited 
						in T. P Thornten, “US-India relations during the Nixon 
						and Ford years” in <i>The Hope and The Reality: 
						US-Indian Relations from Roosevelt to Reagan</i>, ed. H. 
						E Gould and S. Ganguly (Boulder CO, Westview, 1992), 
						pp.&nbsp;93–4. The “personal friendship” between Nixon and 
						Yahya was cemented in 1969 during Nixon's fourth and 
						perhaps his briefest visit to Pakistan when he sought 
						Yahya's help in normalizing relationship with China.</a></p>

						<p align="justify"><a name="fn21">21&nbsp; Kissinger's 
						evaluation of the situation described the possible roles 
						of the external players – India, US, China, and Russia. 
						He wrote:</a></p>
						<p align="justify">India will be the most important (of 
						the outside players). By training and equipping a 
						relatively small Bengali resistance force, India can 
						help keep active resistance alive and increase the 
						chances of prolonged guerilla war. From all indications, 
						the Indians intend to follow such a course. They could 
						also make it difficult for Yahya to negotiate a 
						political transition in East Pakistan by recognizing a 
						Bengali government. They seem more cautious on this.</p>
						<p align="justify">The US will be an important factor 
						from outside the area: (1) We still have influence in 
						West Pakistan and remain important to India. (b) US 
						economic support – multiplied by US leadership in the 
						World Bank consortium of aid donors – remains crucial to 
						West Pakistan. Neither Moscow nor Peking can duplicate 
						this assistance. (c) Our military supply, while 
						relatively small and unlikely to affect the outcome of 
						the fighting, is an important symbolic element in our 
						posture.</p>
						<p align="justify">The USSR is concerned that 
						instability will work to China's advantage, and has 
						shown perhaps more inclination in recent years than the 
						US towards trying to settle disputes in the 
						subcontinent. In the short run, the Soviet interests 
						seem to parallel our own, although they would certainly 
						like to use this situation to undercut our position in 
						India.</p>
						<p align="justify">Communist China could (a) be West 
						Pakistan's main ally in threatening India with 
						diversionary military moves and (b) eventually enter the 
						contest with India for control of the East Pakistani 
						resistance movement. For the moment, the Chinese seem to 
						have cast their lot with the West Pakistanis.</p>

						However, throughout May hectic jockeying continued. 
						Various small groups were looking for ways to remove 
						Tajuddin Ahmed from the post of PM. The proclamation of 
						independence accorded the President and in his absence 
						the Vice President the power to appoint and dismiss 
						ministers. A number of individuals and groups approached 
						Nazrul Islam to exercise his authority in this regard.</a></p>
						<p align="justify"><a name="fn56">56&nbsp; A committee to

						after long deliberations and on the insistence of D. P. 
						Dhar on September 9. The committee, in its final shape, 
						however, had very limited authority and was not 
						something that the Indian government originally 
						expected. The move also irked the Indian conservatives 
						within and outside the administration. Samar Guha, an 
						academician and the Head of the “National Coordination 
						Committee for Bangladesh Movement” alleged that D. P 
						Dhar and Foreign Secretary T. N. Kaul had been pushing
