  <p class="MsoNormal">Honorable PM, leader of the main opposition, my 
  compatriots, I am penning this open letter to you after being utterly 
  helpless, physically attacked, and in a state of hopelessness.&nbsp; All these have 
  made my life and my family members’ life unbearable.&nbsp; As I was returning from 
  this year’s ‘Book Fair’ in the evening of February 27, some killer goons 
  attacked me physically; I was not supposed to have lived after the brutal 
  attack.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I returned to this mortal world after being “dead” (in 
  coma) for four days.&nbsp; For this, I remain ever so grateful to everyone.&nbsp; I am 
  thankful to the honorable PM because she took care of my treatment in the 
  aftermath of the attack; I am also indebted to the main opposition party 
  leader for she came hurriedly to see me after I was physically assaulted and 
  she feared for my life; I am also greatly indebted to my compatriots those who 
  grieved seeing my hapless condition, they were moved and they prayed for my 
  well-being.&nbsp; I am also thankful to my fellow academicians and students at the 
  universities, artists, and politicians those who worked tirelessly to keep me 
  alive.&nbsp; I was not supposed to come back to life, but I did.&nbsp; For which a 
  dedicated bunch of physicians should receive my plaudits.&nbsp; I remain ever so 
  grateful to them.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">After I was mortally wounded on February 27, I became a 
  darling to my compatriots; those who never knew me before they also inquired 
  about my well-being.&nbsp; However, I am now attacked again and my family is living 
  in a state of despondency; we are now living in a state of fright.&nbsp; On July 
  24, 2004, the evil bunch who attacked me earlier tried to abduct my only son, 
  Anannya; on July 25, 2004, they put us again in a state of panic after 
  threatening us through a telephone call this time they said that they will 
  blast a bomb in my house.&nbsp; At this time, mine is the most panic stricken 
  family in Bangladesh whose members may be hurt in any moment.&nbsp; That is the 
  reason I am now appealing to you hoping that you may come forward to help me 
  out.&nbsp; You are the only ones who lend your helping hand at this time of 
  despair.&nbsp; You have done your duty when I was struggling with my death; aren’t 
  you going to stand by me at this perilous time?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I look physically okay now, but I am far from being 
  healthy.&nbsp; One of my eyes is half blind, my disfigured face still shows the 
  scars of vicious attack, the sutures on my face are still painful for me, my 
  lips are partially numb, I wear dentures, infirmity has taken hold of me.&nbsp; 
  After my return from medical treatment at abroad, I am interned in my home 
  because my life is not safe outside; I maybe attacked physically if I venture 
  outside.&nbsp; For my safety the government has assigned some police, for this I am 
  thankful.&nbsp; Still then, I am receiving repeated death threats; my family 
  members are facing danger.&nbsp; All of these are making our lives utterly 
  miserable.&nbsp; I cannot look at the panic-stricken face of my loved ones because 
  their countenance bears the mark of mental anguish; it seems as if they are 
  living in a state of fear surrounded by sharp knives or living near a live 
  volcano.&nbsp; Sometimes I feel that the marauding gang of assassins surrounds them 
  and there is no one to protect them from harm. &nbsp;Under this dire circumstance, 
  living a normal life is all too difficult and meaningless; I don’t know 
  whether you could imagine the state of hopelessness that I am in.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">We as a family feel that this fear for untimely death is 
  dictating our life now; we could have committed a mass suicide if we could 
  have attained a nirvana from our wretched life.&nbsp; We could have showered our 
  assassins with the moon and flowers as we prepare to exit this mortal world; 
  but we are infirm, our love for this mortal world is too strong and that is 
  why we remain in a state of alert.&nbsp; We fear for the safety of any family 
  members who ventures out and when I am outside I fear for my family members 
  who are inside home.&nbsp; Even in 1971, my life was not that difficult!&nbsp; These 
  days I feel pity for myself, for my life, and for my hapless motherland.&nbsp; What 
  has become of this land where a professor and a writer cannot lead a simple 
  and placid life, cannot browse a book or pen a stanza of poem.&nbsp; This is 
  because the roving assassins are making his life a miserable one even in his 
  sleep.&nbsp; Did we want Bangladesh for all this?&nbsp; Did many a patriot shed their 
  blood for this?&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I am a professor and a writer; I have been teaching for 
  the last 36 years and writing for even longer period.&nbsp; I never did neglect to 
  teach my students properly; I taught them as per their acumen and interest; 
  thousands of students considered me as one of their dearest and best teacher.&nbsp; 
  Their love and respect for me had gratified me.&nbsp; I always tried to teach my 
  students new things; tried my best to get them out of the old moldings because 
  I believe in my heart that it is the very nature of knowledge to create new 
  things.&nbsp; The world of ours has progressed thus far because humankind has been 
  able to generate new information.&nbsp; I have been writing ceaselessly not in one 
  direction but in many directions.&nbsp; Poetry, novel, essay, criticism, 
  linguistics, political analysis, literature for kids, etc., are the myriad 
  fields in which I have contributed thus far.&nbsp; I have published about 70 
  books.&nbsp; Many a reader agrees that I have enriched Bengali literature through 
  my writing, even after my departure from this world, my contributions will be 
  acknowledged.&nbsp; Despite all these positive contributions, my life is a wretched 
  one at this time because the assassins are regularly issuing death threats 
  against my family members and me.&nbsp; Living in the shadow of a constant threat I 
  am becoming oblivious to knowledge and literature.&nbsp; Is it then fair that one 
  of the leading professors of Bangladesh has to live under the constant threat 
  of losing his life?&nbsp; Have I done well in my studies, earned a good name for 
  myself as an academician and writer, earned the respect from my compatriots 
  only to be threatened by the goons who want to see me dead?&nbsp; Will my premature 
  death in the hands of the assassins bring prosperity to Bangladesh?&nbsp; Or, will 
  it mar the nation with disgrace?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">I am both a scribe and a sensitive human being to whom it 
  is more disgraceful to live in the confine of my house than to be dead.&nbsp; I 
  oft-remember once I used to take a stroll by myself, visit a village to see 
  the moon, birds, and rivers; today, I lost that privilege, today, I cannot 
  walk alone or look at the moon, river, or birds.&nbsp; To the contrary, those 
  marauding assassins, who never looked at the moon, have their rights preserved 
  who want to see me a dead man.&nbsp; To a person who wants to enrich himself with 
  knowledge and who wants to write, nothing could be worse than being interned 
  into a house; this would blunt his creativity.&nbsp; I am not alone in this 
  predicament; quite a few other professors of Dhaka University had been given 
  the death sentence by the obscurantists.&nbsp; I feel their pain, but for how long 
  do we have to endure this pain?&nbsp; Dear Prime Minister, leader of the main 
  opposition party, my compatriots, this not the time for you to remain 
  reticent, you must make note of those people who are inflicting this pain on 
  us.&nbsp; This is your noble duty.&nbsp; You have to carry out your duty or else the 
  future generation will look at you with ambivalence. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">We wanted to visualize our motherland, Bangladesh, as a 
  developed, modern, and peaceful nation; however, we failed to build the nation 
  in that way.&nbsp; The image Bangladesh portrays to outside world is not a good 
  one; the way the recent threats to my family and myself have perturbed us will 
  mar the image even further.&nbsp; For sure, you know that those who are making my 
  life miserable belong to a separate ideology.&nbsp; A nation is deemed proper and 
  could only progress when there is a diversity of opinion and when people 
  holding a diverse opinion can live side-by-side.&nbsp; The essence of democracy is 
  to respect and tolerate a differing opinion and ideology. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">We could refute an opinion or ideology only through 
  knowledge and arguments, but nowhere it says that a person with differing 
  opinion should be threatened to kill or even killed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in 
  Bangladesh it has become a norm not to debate with a person who holds a 
  counter view, but to settle the score with a threat to kill the person or by 
  killing the person.&nbsp; I have become a prime target now for political 
  assassination.&nbsp; Isn’t it true that my writings have enriched Bangladesh?&nbsp; Have 
  I not dedicated my life for Bangladesh because I love my country?&nbsp; Once I am 
  gone from this mortal world, won’t Bangalees feel proud for what I have done?&nbsp; 
  If these are correct, then why am I being tortured this way when I am still 
  alive?&nbsp; I am hoping that you will come to aid in my time of distress, 
  immediately.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Bangladesh is amidst a great danger now, a devastated 
  flood has struck us, there is no end to human sufferings; however, this is not 
  the last deluge to hit Bangladesh.&nbsp; Bangladesh is sinking albeit very slowly, 
  according to some geologist the nation may sink into the Bay of Bengal in the 
  next quarter century.&nbsp; But we could obstruct this downward journey through 
  knowledge and our effort.&nbsp; If we fail to take up the measure, then we 
  Bangladeshis have to swim ashore to another nation just as a rodent does.&nbsp; 
  Maybe, others will refuse us to climb ashore.&nbsp; Many of us would be dead in the 
  next quarter century.&nbsp; However, we should work for our next generation.&nbsp; We 
  are duty bound to build a nation that is safe and advanced for our next 
  generation.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">But no one gives a damn about it.&nbsp; The fundamentalists 
  are bent on killing people who hold a similar philosophy of life like mine; 
  they think annihilating folks like me would solve all the problems that ail 
  Bangladesh.&nbsp; Amidst this devastating flood, I would like to mingle with our 
  people, but I am bereft of that right.&nbsp; Being confined to the four walls of my 
  house I could see how agonizingly they are passing theirs time.&nbsp; I hear that 
  my ancestral village is under water, but I could hardly visit the place; if I 
  attempt to go there, the marauding band of assassins will surely follow me.&nbsp; 
  The nature is wreaking havoc on us now, but those assassins who hold a 
  differing view from mine put my life in danger.&nbsp; This vile force has not given 
  up the idea to threaten me ad infinitum even when calamities have struck 
  Bangladesh.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Dear honorable Prime Minister, leader of the main 
  opposition party, my compatriots, in this time of great danger I am handing 
  over the security of my family members and mine in your hand.&nbsp; It is up to you 
  to decide whether Bangladesh will remain under the sharp instrument of murder 
  hold by the marauding band of assassins, should my family members and I spend 
  sleepless night frightened by the ominous presence of the goons?&nbsp; Should the 
  nation of ours be inundated with blood?&nbsp; Will the humanity get a shiver 
  watching Bangladesh in this pathetic state?&nbsp; We don’t have much time; you 
  decide what would be the proper step to take and this is my earnest request.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
