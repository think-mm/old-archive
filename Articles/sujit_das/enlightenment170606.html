	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Les Misérables is my all time 
	favorite novel. This great literature of all time, written by Victor Hugo, 
	is an excellent work which fathoms the author’s humanity and vision. The 
	emotional intensity of this dramatic story revolves around an ex-convict 
	‘Jean Valjean’ as a central character. His life and dignity were restored by 
	a Bishop’s trust and kindness, which drastically converted him from a 
	miserable and hated criminal into a heroic, peaceful, loving and responsible 
	human being. Bishop said “Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to 
	evil, but to good. It is your soul I am buying for you. I withdraw it from 
	dark thoughts and from the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God!” Later 
	on Valjean was faced with obstacles that made him choose between right and 
	wrong. He had always chosen the right path. This is enlightenment. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Indian history, we read the 
	famous story of Ashoka (273 BC to 232 BC), the great emperor of the Maurya 
	Empire and his spiritual conversion from “murderer and heartless Ashoka” (Chanda 
	Ashoka) to “the dutiful and kindhearted Ashoka” (Dharma Ashoka). The extent 
	of killing he witnessed in the Kalinga war (265 BC or 263 BC; Ashoka’s 
	powerful army, advanced weapons and experienced generals and soldiers had 
	plundered and destroyed the neighborhood kingdom Kalinga. Historians had 
	written that more than 100,000 people were killed on the Kalinga side and 
	10,000 from Ashoka's army; thousands of men and women were deported. It was 
	the greatest invasion ever recorded in Indian history until then) 
	enlightened and transformed him into an ideal and righteous ruler, 
	propagating Buddha's message of peace and non-violence after adopting 
	Buddhism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Hindu mythology, there is a story 
	of a heartless highway robber, Ratnakar. He once chanced to confront Brahma 
	and Narada which caused his spiritual transformation. This merciless bandit 
	later on became Maharshi Valmiki, who was the author of the original 
	Ramayana. In Buddhist mythology there is a similar story of a dreaded bandit 
	and killer, named Angulimala. He too gave up killing and looting and 
	achieved nirvana after coming in contact with Tathagata Buddha. This is 
	enlightenment. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And, when a seventy year old Imam 
	advices a Muslim girl to “run” from Islam “before it is too late”, I lower 
	my head in great respect and feel like to touch his feet and seek blessings, 
	because, this is also an excellent example of enlightenment. It is no 
	fiction or no mythology. This has happened in front of our eyes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Incidents like suicide bombing, 
	killing, murdering, hating others in the name of religion sadden me a lot. 
	During this time I prefer to read the true stories of “leaving Islam” on 
	some other sites. On one morning, I read the above wonderful testimony. 
	Aisha, a young Muslim lady talked about her “spiritual journey” out of 
	Islam. She read few articles of Ali Sina, which are written in a “very 
	powerful and uncompromising way”. She decided to show some of the articles 
	to the Imam. The Imam is a “well-educated man in the Islamic science” and 
	upon reading the articles this already enlightened Imam said “I’m old. My 
	life is coming to an end. But you, Aisha, are young. Run, girl, run before 
	it is too late!” At the end Aisha thanked Ali Sina “for the freedom that I 
	enjoy now.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What the Islamic fundamentalists 
	fear most is rational thinking and debate on Islam. If the Muslims are given 
	the liberty of expressing their doubts on Islam; then the spiritual 
	bankruptcy of this 1400 years old cult will come into limelight and in that 
	case, who will be ready to go for suicide bombing? From the very deep bottom 
	of their heart, every Mullah knows this truth. But they have to remain 
	silent and maintain the “trade secret” – after all their bread and butter 
	come from the Islamic business. Take the case of Ahmed K. After reading 
	Koran and Hadith few times, his rational mind started asking questions. The 
	conquest and subjugation of the Jews, rape of innocent women, assassination 
	and all sorts of other criminal activities of the Prophet disturbed him a 
	lot. He went to the mosque and asked the Mulavi. Initially Mulavi tried his 
	best to explain, but, “... its like I knew that he wasn't going to be able 
	to justify some of the atrocities committed by Mohammed. However the part 
	where he got stuck was the Aisha question. How can a man of more than 50 
	years old have sexual feelings for a girl of only 6! After he gave me a 
	dissatisfactory answer I just went quiet and walked away. I was out the door 
	and I looked back, He looked at me and he put his head down... I think he 
	knew I wasn't going to come back. Since then I have been rather heart broken 
	as I have lost my faith. Islam is a falsehood, a pure hoax”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another example is Qadir Sheikh. 
	Qadir is from India. When he asked some “forbidden” questions -- “Maulvi did 
	not like the questions, he also did not have the answers and called it a 
	highly unislamic behavior to ask forbidden questions which challenge the 
	validity of the Quran”. Ultimately, “I was called a &quot;kaafir&quot; (some who 
	commits a kuffr [balsphemy]) and physically thrown out of the same mosque, 
	where I had offered my namaaz (obligatory prayer) for the last 37 years, by 
	the Maulvi's assistants.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, this is the Maulavi’s “Islamic” 
	reply to Qadir’s all “unislamic” questions. Later on Qadir left Islam and 
	returned to Hindu culture. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“I was beaten by Imams because I 
	asked too many questions. I was beaten all the time.” This is the bitter 
	experience of Alkaliel, a Muslim woman from Russia. Her testimony is a 
	burning example of how Islam had been protected for over 1400 years. Muslims 
	must be kept in ignorance, to keep them in slavery of Islam. No wonder Ali 
	Sina said, “Muslims are the first victims of Islam”. See the Imam’s advice 
	to the battered lady “Being a good mother doesn’t require education”. 
	Mullah’s capital for Islamic business is the follower’s ignorance. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another thought-provoking testimony 
	is written by Abul Kasem. Abul, during his childhood days in Bangladesh, 
	witnessed the murder of an entire family of a non-Muslim. Though he had 
	hardly any knowledge about Islam, his little doubting mind and moral values 
	could not support the idea of killing. It was a devastating experience which 
	left a scar in his soft mind. He was more shocked to see that, some Muslims 
	were rejoicing over the deaths. This horrible incident helped to plant seed 
	of doubts in his mind and most probably, on that very day Abul took his 
	first step towards enlightenment. This is where all the Islamic scholars, 
	Imams, Mullahs and fundamentalists are failed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">God has given us two eyes to see. 
	But we need hindsight and rational power to understand and analyze 
	something. Here again the so-called Islamic scholars are failed. Take the 
	case of Abu Lahab. Abu belongs to an Arab family, and from USA. Before 
	enlightenment he was a “super religious Muslim”- this is how he introduced 
	himself. He was doing all 5 daily prayers since he was about eight year old 
	and had a record of never missing one prayer from 8th grade, till his 4th 
	year in college. He even walked out of movie theaters to catch sallat and 
	prayed extra prayers to remain in the good book of Allah. During his college 
	days he met a Christian girl. He was astonished to see her love for God. 
	Then in one auspicious day his rational mind took the upper hand and he 
	asked a question to himself - how could God put someone who loves Him so 
	much into hell? He then began to observe other Christians, Hindus, Jews, 
	whoever; they really loved God, but weren't Muslim. All to hell? His 
	spiritual journey started here. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Enlightenment is a completely one 
	way journey. For an enlightened soul, there is no coming back. It is the end 
	of a long nightmare. You wake up from sleep and discover that what you had 
	experienced is actually a bad dream, not reality. Enlightenment is entering 
	into the real world of freedom. You enjoy real freedom when you come to 
	understand that the purpose of your life and your true essence are actually 
	beyond the world of religious thoughts. The enlightened soul is like a free 
	bird out of the cage; free from bondage, slavery, and religious 
	superstitions; on top of everything, you obtain your basic right, ie, your 
	freedom of thought. Initially it is a painful climb, but the pain of it 
	turns into a positive pleasure very shortly. Each step upwards makes an 
	enlightened soul feel stronger and fit for the next because God is now on 
	his side. Have a look at the testimony of Ali Sina. His journey to freedom 
	was not easy. After reading the Quran he was depressed, because it was hard 
	to accept the violent teachings of the Quran, which jolted him and shook the 
	foundation of his religious belief. Ali said, “It is much easier to keep our 
	eyes closed and pretend nothing has happened. Believe it or not for one year 
	after leaving Islam I kept praying and doing the fast. It took me one full 
	year to stop being a hypocrite. I knew Islam was false yet I feared giving 
	up the rituals that I had grown up with.” Religious faith is deeply rooted 
	in mind. Sometimes it takes some time to uproot the wrong ideas. This is 
	normal human psychology. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Enlightenment is the liberation of a 
	soul from his self-caused state of slavery. It is so easy to be free, but it 
	still looks like so difficult. A person cannot make him free unless he 
	prepares himself for that. Freedom is not for the cowards. Cowards live and 
	die within the bondage. The cowards move in a circular way and keep 
	searching for the end till they die. Take the case of an American ex-Muslim, 
	who reverted back to Islam. The reason as per him is -- “I see it as 
	essential that I remain within Islam, in order to push for reforms from 
	within, I refuse to let the extremists have it all their own way and abandon 
	the majority of Muslims to their clutches!”. I think, this person actually 
	could not uproot the Islamic superstition of Allah’s “hellfire” from his 
	mind, though I might be wrong. Reforming Islam in not possible. So far, many 
	reformers and rationalists in Islam had tried but, all of them had failed. 
	He root cause is unchangeable Quran. Can we reform the “Untouchablity” of 
	Hinduism? Can we practice untouchability by giving it a touch of humanity 
	and make it Godlike? Is not it justifiable that we eliminate the total 
	“concept” of Untouchablity completely from the root? Can you reform Nazism? 
	Islam is a hoax, a falsehood. How can you modify a hoax? Is not it 
	ridiculous? It shows very clearly, how Islam truly “conquers” the mind and 
	heart of some of its followers. But again, as I had said, enlightenment is 
	not for cowards. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unlike cowards, an enlightened 
	person is aware of the true nature of the universe and thus moves closer to 
	the real God with every step. He cannot make any mistake, like the 
	fictitious main character of Les Misérables and there is no evil power in 
	this world which can force them to deviate from the true path, because he 
	knows the truth. Let’s have a look at the wonderful statement of Mehmood. 
	Who was “100% ready to blow himself up” for his Islamic faith. Few quotes 
	from his testimony are as follows, which are self explanatory, </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“The mind is its own place, and can 
	make of itself a hell or a heaven ….. Just six months ago I was another 
	person. Today I can stand on my feet and call myself a free man. Then it was 
	darkness, today it is light. I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Then I would 
	have bowed down to the Demonic Allah”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“I have no words to express my 
	feelings. I want to rejoice in every moment, to live every moment to the 
	full. I want to rejoice in this beautiful earth and our wonderful human 
	race, in spite of the ugly misery they live in because of the cult invented 
	by the psychotic, evil terrorist Muhammad”. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“The task (enlightening other 
	Muslims) is not as hard as it may seem. Islam is a house of one billion 
	cards. If a man 100% ready to blow himself up like me can change so fast so 
	can the others.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Change of Islamic faith can change a 
	person completely. It can reform a murderer. Take the case of Anwar Shaikh. 
	During the partition of India / Pakistan, he was a young man, he was so 
	filled with hate against non-Muslim that he went out with a knife and killed 
	two innocent Sikhs, a father and a son and a Hindu. He did not know anyone 
	of them. But he killed them because they were the first non-Muslims he saw 
	on the streets. This gruesome memory of his crime under the influence of 
	Islamic “drug” haunts him to this day. Today Anwar is a famous 
	anti-Islamist. He also authored few books to expose Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jean Valjean, Mahmood and Anwar 
	Shaikh; all of them had crossed the point of no return. Their souls do not 
	belong to Satan anymore. They are now God’s own soldier in his army of 
	truth. All of them are now valuable asset to mankind. Nowhere, I have ever 
	witnessed any situation where fact and fiction are inseparable with each 
	other. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Only an enlightened soul can advance 
	humanity in the right direction. The way is open to everyone who is willing 
	to step on this path. It’s never too late. Age does not matter at all. 
	Enlightenment is a spiritual gain by self-realization, which will keep on 
	giving you dividends not only this life but afterlife also. No guru or 
	teacher can give you this. No super-computer or modern technology is 
	required for self-realization. It should come from within your heart. Here, 
	you are your own Prophet and follower, both. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Everybody has a different perception 
	of God. I believe there is only one universe, one soul. Every individual 
	part of this mankind is equal to each other. God is a loving, wise “energy” 
	which dwells in every cells of every living body on this earth. God is all 
	loving, all forgiving and needs nothing in return from us. God is not in any 
	way hostile or desirous of sacrifice or desiring to cause harm or demanding 
	obedience of anything of a sacrificial offering. There is no spiritual gain 
	or blessings by committing act of violence and inciting others to act of 
	war, attacking or killing to those who do not share our beliefs. Any Prophet 
	who promises heavenly gain of earthly materials in afterlife cannot be a 
	messenger of the true God. If God is the creator of this universe, how he 
	can command you to sacrifice your life to kill others. Look at the word 
	“terrorism” – you can clearly see an “error” in it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Gandhi said “religion cannot be 
	over-riding morality. Man, for instance, cannot be untruthful, cruel or 
	incontinent and claim to have God on his side”. If your religious belief 
	supercedes your moral value, then either your belief is false and it has got 
	no “divine touch” or you have lost your moral values. If your religion does 
	not have a divine touch, then it’s a dangerous cult. If you have lost your 
	moral values then you are not a human because humanity and morality are 
	inseparable. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Every enlightened soul turns into a 
	torch of guidance to others. This is how the number of ex-Muslims grows 
	exponentially. In fact it is the moral duty of each of us. This is the only 
	way we can save the mankind. The evil must be destroyed before it destroys 
	us.</font> </p>
