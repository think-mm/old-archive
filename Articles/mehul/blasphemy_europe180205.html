	<div class="doc-layout-body">
		<font size="2"></font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The recent Jyllands Posten 
		cartoon controversy and the reams of newspaper space devoted to it have 
		thrown up the hypocrisy that Europe has exhibited over the years over 
		the criticism, especially witty criticism using blasphemy laws. The fact 
		is, though, that with the exception of France and Belgium, every EU 
		country has blasphemy laws that restrict artistic expression in one way 
		or another. In 1999, this would become evident in the case of Nigel 
		Wingrove’s film “Visions of Ecstasy” which attempted to put the 
		fantasies recorded by the nun Theresa of Avila on celluloid. The British 
		government banned the film, and, an appeal to the European Court for 
		Human Rights did not help in overturning the ban. The BBC, at the time, 
		seemed to revel in hitting out at Wingrove warning him through it’s news 
		bulletins that blasphemy could be punished in the UK with a life 
		sentence. The intimidation of a filmmaker who had merely used the nun’s 
		fantasies, laced as they were with sexual imagery, to make a film, was 
		acceptable to both the British government as well as to the EU. No major 
		newspaper at the time raised a voice of protest. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There has also been the 
		hypocrisy of the Jyllands Posten’s stand on blasphemy as investigated by 
		the Guardian. After rejecting cartoons of Jesus Christ in a country that 
		is nominally mostly Lutheran, the newspaper apparently had little 
		compunction about letting their pages be used to target the country’s 
		largest minority. The reason for this is simple - most European nations 
		have blasphemy laws that seek to throttle criticism of Christianity. 
		Other religions, and atheism are fair game for those who would like to 
		use the pen, brush or megaphone. It is not difficult to look back to the 
		Dark Ages to figure out where these laws got their inspiration from. The 
		more revealing thing, however, is that modern Europe, smug in it’s usual 
		lectures to the rest of the world on human rights, freedom of expression 
		etc still prohibits criticism of Christianity in what can only be 
		considered hypocrisy of the worst kind. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are, though, two nations 
		in the EU whose laws allow blasphemy - France and Belgium. But, this is 
		on paper and even there, people have been persecuted in recent times for 
		their views. Robyn Johannes, president of the Union des Athees, whom I 
		regard as a personal friend, found that criticizing even the pope could 
		be extremely dangerous some years ago. Then pope John Paul II on a visit 
		to Belgium made a statement that accused atheists of running the 
		concentration camps during World War II. Johannes put up posters that 
		showed the Catholic church’s support for the Nazis and their assistance 
		to escaping Nazis after the end of the war and found him promptly 
		arrested, accused of attempting to incite violence against the head of a 
		friendly nation and conspiring against the king and government of 
		Belgium. When produced in court, he asked the prosecution whether the 
		pope had visited Belgium as the leader of a sovereign nation, the 
		Vatican City, or as leader of the church. If he had visited as the 
		leader of a religious organization, he could be criticized. And, if he 
		was visiting as the head of a foreign country, Belgian law forbade the 
		kind of statement that he made. The prosecution fumbled and said that 
		the poster campaign had been illegal, for which a fine was levied and 
		Johannes paid it. He then asked to sue the crown for public defamation 
		if the charges against him were not dropped immediately, and the 
		prosecution withdrew, figuratively speaking, with it’s collective tail 
		between it’s legs. It was evident that though the days of beheading 
		people for criticizing religion were gone, blasphemy was only slightly 
		safer. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While the reaction to the 
		Mohammad cartoons has been condemnable and the behavior of the 
		protestors who have torched properties, looted businesses and killed 
		people over them has been criminal, the fact is that the publication of 
		the cartoons was meant to poke fun at Islam. It is possible to rightly 
		condemn the inciters of violence in the Islamic world and to observe 
		that the publication of these cartoons was not as innocent as it would 
		seem at first sight. What the whole episode has shown the world, though, 
		is that Muslims can easily be manipulated by madcap mullahs lashing out 
		at phantoms that they see in their delusions. There is obscurantism 
		under both European law as well as in the teachings of the mullahs who 
		are spokespeople for Islam. There is scope to expose both with words, 
		pictures and films. </font></p>
