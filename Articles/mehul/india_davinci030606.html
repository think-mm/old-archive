		<font size="2"></font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After a climbdown at the Centre 
		over a ban on the Da Vinci Code film, we learn that three Indian states 
		have enacted state wide bans - Nagaland, Tamilnadu and Andhra Pradesh 
		and that more are likely to follow this devious lead. These are states 
		where the ruling coalition in India run the show and the statewide ban 
		on this film are little more than a fraud played on the country’s people 
		in banning a film that has not been banned in Italy itself, leave alone 
		in any other Catholic country in the world. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		India has a long record of suppressing it’s people’s individual 
		liberties, and the fact is that Indians have progressively (or should 
		that be regressively?) enjoyed fewer rights year after year under Indian 
		rule than they did even under the country’s erstwhile British colonists. 
		From the heady days after independence was declared in 1947 to the 
		founding of the Indian Republic in 1950, there has been a steady loss of 
		rights as far as the common Indian has been concerned with all kinds of 
		freedoms suppressed from the Right to Property thrown in the dustbin by 
		the 44th Amendment Act of 1978 to the freedom of expression gradually 
		whittled down by successive governments irrespective of their political 
		leanings. And this is a country that touts itself as the world’s largest 
		democracy while it arms itself to the teeth with nuclear arms and 
		attempts to sell itself as an ally to the world’s democratic nations.</font><p align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><br>
		The ban in Tamilnadu, my former home state and my birthplace has been 
		more disturbing to me personally than those elsewhere - Andhra Pradesh 
		is, after all, ruled by a Catholic Chief Minister who has never made any 
		secret of his fanatical beliefs, and he was bound to go by the diktats 
		of the local church hooligans who have been threatening violent 
		agitations though nothing of the sort has actually happened anywhere. M 
		Karunanidhi, the Tamilnadu Chief Minister, found his own plays banned 
		several times in the past along with those of his mentor C N Annadurai 
		and other playwrights and writers like C P Sittarasu under the Congress 
		government with which his party is allied in the current coalition in 
		New Delhi. He has been a man who has been known to talk about the 
		freedom of expression, having been a script writer for the film industry 
		before he came into politics and a hobby script writer right through his 
		political career. This hypocritical move by a politician who came to 
		power claiming that he would end the fascist rule of his predecessor J 
		Jayalalitha has been all the more telling - the entire political system 
		has been shown to be nothing more than pitch black pots and kettles each 
		screaming loudly that they are whiter than milk, purer than the driven 
		snow. Jayalalitha had been responsible for the country’s only ban on the 
		Vagina Molologues, a play that had been allowed to run even in Pakistan, 
		a country that India is fond of denouncing as a dictatorship.</font><p align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><br>
		The Gujarat state government banned Amir Khan’s film Fanaa because the 
		actor participated in a meeting for the rights of tribal people 
		displaced by dam constructions there. The ruling coalition protested 
		this and then it went straight on to ban the Da Vinci Code film in a 
		more devious way than the obviously fundamentalist Narendra Modi 
		government used in Gujarat. What does this say about the world’s most 
		heavily touted democratic whitewash? The Indian fraud continues merrily 
		onwards while the rest of the world seems content to go along with it. 
		Let it not be forgotten that the Nazis denounced and destroyed art that 
		they did not like - before they started killing people. If the world is 
		to make sure that India does not do this to it’s own people or to it’s 
		neighbors, it had better keep a wary eye on this huge, powerful and 
		increasingly wealthy banana republic.</font><p align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><br>
		And no other political party in India is innocent in this fraud on 
		Indians’ rights or on the cooked up image of a democracy that India 
		touts to the rest of the world - the Congress famously banned Salman 
		Rushdie’s Satanic Verses even before Iran’s illiterate thug Ayatollah 
		Khomeini did, the Communists have banned Taslima Nasrin’s writing in 
		West Bengal and the BJP openly supported that ban and also refused to 
		withdraw the Satanic Verses ban even though there was a time when they 
		had the clout to repeal it in the country. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		India is not a country that respects human rights or their freedom of 
		expression at all. Tamilnadu is a wealthy state that has been the 
		recipient of hundreds of million dollars in US and European investment. 
		If the west continues to put money there it may as well invest in Iran 
		or in the provinces in Afghanistan and Pakistan where Bin Laden is 
		supposedly lodged. There is little difference between these state 
		governments and their partners in the Central Government in India as far 
		as their actions are concerned and the actions of the Taliban or Al 
		Qaeda. The only difference is that Al Qaeda does not have nuclear 
		weapons - the Indian state does.</font><p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
