																		to work 
																		in a far 
																		off land

																		the

																		not have 
																		found a 
																		job that 
																		could 
																		feed 
																		them and 
																		their 
																		children, 
																		presumably 
																		he was 
																		semi

																		This

																		as she 
																		stripped 
																		to the 
																		music 
																		playing 
																		in bars 
																		and 
																		clients 
																		fondled 
																		her 
																		body, 
																		pushed 
																		money 
																		into her 
																		undergarments

																		Lying on

																		trying 
																		hard to 
																		rid his

Every night, when she was a stripper, she must have wondered when her pain would end.  When  she would be able to spend time with her husband and children like any other mother, cooking for them, feeding them, and putting them to bed. Every moment of her life, she would have yearned for a day when she would be free from this torture. And, the children and husband for whom she bore this daily humiliation were taken away from her. As a stripper, she would still have got to see her children when she returned home in the early hours of the morning. Like every other mother, she would have seen them off to school before getting some sleep during the day, waking before they returned to cook and leave to be pawed and felt by strange men. Her children would have been her refuge, hugging their mother, lying with their heads on her lap when they saw her, their little hugs providing a healing   touch to the invisible scars on her body from her occupational torture every night. With them taken away from her, and with no hope that she would ever see them again, she took her life.\n",1]
