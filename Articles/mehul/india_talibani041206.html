		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the international uproar 
		over the harassment of actress Khushboo by a political party led by the 
		father of India’s Minister for Health, Dr Anbumani Ramdoss died down, we 
		now have one more high profile case of Indian busybodies interfering in 
		displays of affection in the public eye. Many years ago when the then 
		South African President Nelson Mandela kissed actress Shabana Azmi, a 
		woman young enough to be his grand-daughter, on her forehead, a certain 
		prude wrote to the Times of India asking if this implied that Ms Azmi 
		would welcome other men to her bed as well. It wasn;t the letter itself 
		that was disgraceful. What was worse was that the Times allowed it to be 
		published instead of throwing it into the waste paper bin. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But then, this kind of 
		journalism is an old tradition in India. When the Miss World pageant was 
		held in Bangalore many years ago, a writer in the Indian Express, Amiya 
		Ganguli, started screaming hoarsely about the “Apasanskriti” that this 
		contest represented. On his goading sundry Hindu fundamentalists 
		appeared out of the woodwork with a young woman lawyer from Bangalore 
		claiming that she had access to cyanide capsules and that she would 
		consume them if the contest actually took place. There was also a 
		farmers’ representative, Dr Nanjundasamy, now deceased, who threatened 
		to set the cuty afire if the contest was permitted. Nanjundasamy 
		conveniently went off on a junket most sponsored by his NGO to the USA 
		when the contest took place and the woman lawyer who threatened to 
		consume cyanide was consigned to the dustbin of history after her 15 
		minutes of fame. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This time, another otherwise 
		unheard of lawyer has filed a lawsuit against Rajasthan Chief Minister 
		Vasundhara Raje Scindia and Biocon India Chairperson Kiran Majumdar-Shaw 
		for kissing in public. Perhaps, this is a cynical ploy by the lawyer to 
		gain some attention for himself and be seen while he is otherwise a non 
		entity. Perhaps, it is his quest for his own 15 minutes of fame. 
		Perhaps, it is yet another expression of India’s periodical bouts of 
		Talibanist madness. Perhaps, India’s madness actually inspired the 
		Taliban as it is a considerably older phenomenon than the late 1980s 
		origin of the worst bunch of thugs to ever rule a country since the fall 
		of the Nazis. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For a long time, India, 
		especially after Independence, practiced a prudery that would have done 
		the Victorians proud. Kissing scenes were banned in films while scenes 
		featuring bloody and violent rapes were gleefully permitted by the 
		Central Board of Film Censors, a body that must have attracted the worst 
		perverts the world had ever seen. Until the Taliban took Afghanistan 
		over. A Devika Rani may have done kissing scenes in the 1940s but there 
		would be none until the late 90s when several public voices started 
		speaking up against the sheer hypocrisy of the official Indian position 
		on matters like this. Actresses whose morphed images were misused by 
		pranksters ended up being sued by Mahila Mandals who did not have the 
		brains to recognize that these poor women were victims and not 
		perpatrators of any crime. And these days, inspired by Anbumani Ramdoss’ 
		partymens’ thuggery which they very nearly got away with, there are 
		sundry lawsuits filed against virtually every actress from time to time 
		in India’s courts. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My question is simply this – why 
		is it so difficult for India’s courts to ask the people who come up with 
		these ridiculous lawsuits before them to take a hike? Why can the courts 
		not tell these thugs that adults have a right to displays of affection 
		that are none of their business? That it is no one else’s business what 
		sexual orientation someone follows, if, indeed, the now much publicized 
		kiss between Ms Scindia and Ms Majumdar-Shaw was more than merely a 
		formal one? Is it because, the courts, acting as they are as 
		interpreters of the laws created by the Indian legislature, are only 
		telling the world that India is a Talibanist state masquerading as a 
		modern nation? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India is, as anyone with even a 
		slight interest in world affairs would remember, the nation that saw 
		riots over the Deepa Mehta film “Fire” because it depicted bisexuality, 
		though the Indian media went out of the way to tell the world that it 
		was about lesbianism, hinting that lesbianism was a horrendous crime as 
		far as India is concerned. For a nation that is determined to portray 
		itself as smugly superior if not to the rest of the world then at least 
		to it’s neighbours, this latest incident is just one more indication of 
		Indian barbarism. With the most powerful newspapers cheerleading for the 
		thugs in India, it is doubtful whether the situation there would get 
		better anytime soon.</font></p>
