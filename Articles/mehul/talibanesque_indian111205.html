	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	In recent weeks, we have seen the pillorying of South Indian actress 
	Khushboo (she earlier spelled her name as Kushbu) for a statement where she 
	said that it was her view that when men were not virgins at marriage they 
	could not expect the same from their wives. Two caste based political 
	parties in Tamilnadu not only held demonstrations outside her house, they 
	also filed several lawsuits against the actress in different courts at 
	different locations in the state in what was a clear attempt at using the 
	law to bully her. After the outcry against the injustice administered to the 
	actress by almost the entire political spectrum (considering that only the 
	Communist Parties reluctantly rose to her defence after keeping mum over the 
	initial furore) in association with the so called lower “justices” in 
	Tamilnadu became public before the world, the Chennai High Court struck down 
	all the cases against the actress in the lower courts. This, too, was a 
	belated decision as the actress had approached the High Court first and had 
	been turned away. She had to then endure a trip across the state to a lower 
	court where she was fined Rs 5000 by a lower level judge while mobs outside 
	the court threw tomatoes and eggs at her car and had to endure the judge’s 
	strictures not to talk about the incident again. The whole spectacle was of 
	a Talibanist system gone amok and when this was found to attract too much 
	detrimental attention, the defenders of the action came out with a series of 
	convoluted “explanations” about why the system had gone mad.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	It was now suggested that the actress had some kind of altercation with an 
	actor and that this had spilled over into the public arena. That the actor 
	who had been “insulted” by her had his fellow caste members enraged into 
	committing the actions that turned the state into a near example of 
	Afghanistan. The nonsense that was bandied about suggested that “anyone had 
	a right to file a lawsuit and that Khushboo had a right to fight this in the 
	courts.” Nowhere was it suggested that the courts had the responsibility of 
	throwing frivolous lawsuits out lock, stock and barrel. But Tamilnadu is no 
	stranger to this kind of madness, and, neither for that matter, is India. 
	The state had earlier banned a performance of Eve Ensler’s celebrated play, 
	“The Vagina Monologues” while the other metros in India had applauded it. 
	The state had allowed a police force gone amok to arrest hundreds of adult 
	couples in Chennai’s Anna Nagar Park and published their pictures in a local 
	newspaper as if they were in “Most Wanted” mug shots. And while two 
	newspapers, the morninger The Hindu and the evening News Today had protested 
	this madness, the rest of the media had conspicuously remained silent 
	through all of it.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	India is no stranger to a muttawa/Talibanesque attitude to sex and 
	sexuality. The noted film director Deepa Mehta had been hounded out of the 
	country for making a film on the plight of widows in Hinduism. For many 
	years, the Central Board of Film Censors, a body that was supposed to 
	insulate the Indian public from anything “obscene,” allowed Indian films to 
	show bloody rapes and the savage beating of women but not scenes of couples 
	kissing affectionately. It was an attitude that suggested to anyone who 
	cared to think that the whole system was perverted and insane to boot. And 
	it was also something that showed Indians as a people who were as 
	hypocritical as the mad mullahs of Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan whom they 
	liked to criticise. Here was a nation that laughed in secret at people who 
	were not really different from itself and made millions selling it’s 
	perverse films to them to boot. The spectre of a pimp talking morality was 
	the closest parallel to what was happening in a land whose national motto 
	was “Satyameva Jayate” or “Truth Triumphs.”</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	India is a country that some say is on the verge of an AIDS explosion. It 
	has been suggested that millions could die from this and experts have been 
	requesting, for some years, to start serious lessons in sexual education to 
	school children. This is something that has been resisted by the “moral 
	brigade” that has openly approved of the actions against the actress calling 
	her an “insult to Tamil womanhood.” Khushboo’s comments came in a survey in 
	the Tamil language edition of India Today magazine which focused on 
	adolescent sex. In their thrust to “make an example” of the actress, the 
	Tamil muttawa also filed lawsuits against the publishers of India Today and 
	asked for it’s Editor in Chief to be brought to court, but the thrust was on 
	savaging the actress, a public humiliation like you would see in an Indian 
	film of an “un-chaste” woman. The Taliban had shot women in football 
	stadiums in Afghanistan after subjecting them to “trials” in their kangaroo 
	courts. The Indian judicial system became a giant kangaroo court to pillory 
	Khushboo in a perfect re-enactment of Talibanist thuggery. The spectacle of 
	thousands of frenzied people outside a court throwing trash at the actress’ 
	car as she drove in to be reprimanded by a judge must not have been any 
	different from the sight of the bloodthirsty madmen who derived a sadistic 
	pleasure watching women shot in Kabul. Perhaps, one saving grace was that 
	there was a token police presence that saved the woman’s life for there is 
	no doubt that she would have been lynched had she not had this to save her.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	This happened in a country whose Prime Minister did not speak a word about 
	this incident while it took place or afterwards. It happened in a country 
	where the Minister for Health happens to be the head of the party that was 
	most vocal in orchestrating this madness. Dr Anbumani Ramdoss also gave an 
	interview after the Chennai High Court exonerated the actress telling the 
	press that he had been wronged and that his party had no real role in the 
	thuggery that had gone before. It happened in a country that calls itself 
	the world’s largest democracy and which is never tired of flaunting its 
	“democratic” credentials at international conventions. It happened in a 
	country where some years earlier, a woman, Bhanwari Devi, had been raped by 
	several higher caste men in public for speaking up against them and where 
	the Rajasthan State High Court had released all of the rapists because it 
	believed that people from higher castes could not rape a woman belonging to 
	a lower caste. You may call Rajasthan a backward state but the Khushboo 
	episode and the ones before it that I have mentioned happened in a wealthy 
	Southern state - a state whose leaders call it “the Detroit of South Asia” 
	because of the large automobile plants located there. It happened in a state 
	that has the world’s largest atheist organization, the Dravidar Kazhagam 
	with more than half a million members. It happened in one of the most 
	literate regions of India making one wonder what horrendous lives women in 
	the less educated “cow belt” live day after day, month after month, year 
	after year. An India that cannot protect its citizens’ right to speak freely 
	and which allows its government machinery to be used in persecuting 
	individuals for saying what is on their minds is a disgrace to every decent 
	Indian. It is little more than a nightmare of Orwellian proportions, a 
	nightmare that 1.2 billion people are doomed to living through.</font></p>
