  How Fundamentalists Win Elections - The Indian Example </span></font></b></p>

  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1980, India, as a nation was at a 
  most unusual point in it’s history. It had struggled with a most difficult 
  situation during the Emergency declared by the Indira Gandhi government in the 
  1970s to elect a combination of socialists and Gandhians to find that this 
  arrangement was, to them, even less satisfactory than the near fascism of the 
  previous one. The 20 point programme and propaganda monstrosities like “From 
  Indus Valley to Indira Gandhi” a film that was all but made compulsory viewing 
  for the country all seemed to forgotten as people struggled with the memory of 
  three years of constant bickering by the Janata government and a near complete 
  lack of governance. All of a sudden, the Congress seemed a viable alternative 
  again and Indira Gandhi was completely forgiven her anti democratic sins and 
  brought back to power. It is said that a leopard does not change it’s spots 
  and, back in power, Mrs Gandhi began working hard to concentrate her hold on 
  politics, presumably worried that she just might lose it again. The decisions 
  that she took cost her her life and those of thousands of Indians and later 
  those of her son’s as well as he only followed in her footsteps. They also 
  heralded the rise of the Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party to power 
  and ensured that Hindu fundamentalism became a part of the Indian political 
  scenario, probably for the first time ever, in Indian history. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During Indira Gandhi’s second term in 
  office, a situation began to emerge that would see the rise of Sikh 
  fundamentalism, Hindu fundamentalism and Islamic fundamentalism in almost 
  simultaneous succession. A dangerous situation began to emerge in the state of 
  Punjab where a Sikh fundamentalist leader Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale 
  began killing Hindus in an attempt at securing independence for a Sikh state 
  that would be called Khalistan from India. Simultaneous murmurs began to grow 
  in the northern state of Kashmir and that would grow into a second religious 
  dispute in due course. But, most importantly, the seed was sown for a marginal 
  Hindu party with just two members of Parliament to come to power altering the 
  course of Indian history nearly forever. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Congress had had it’s own tryst 
  with Hindu fundamentalism under Indira Gandhi and more notably under her 
  younger son, Sanjay Gandhi during the Emergency when he had conducted the mass 
  sterilisation of Muslim youth under the “Family Planning Programme.” When 
  population control measures had been introduced on a voluntary basis some 
  years earlier. Hindu fundamentalists has protested that these implied a “waste 
  of Hindu semen” as it was hinted that Muslims and Christians would not follow 
  small family or contraceptive recommendations. Apparently, Sanjay Gandhi’s 
  forced sterilisation of Muslims was his way (and indirectly that of the 
  establishment, as the Gandhis were the establishment) in redressing this. The 
  situation in the Punjab during the 1980s would see this support for Hindu 
  fundamentalism in the Congress rise as the party’s strategists conveyed to the 
  leadership the message that since Hindus were the largest religion numerically 
  in India, a party that enjoyed their support would never lose power. To a 
  Congress that had been beaten despite holding near total control over 
  everything in the country during the Emergency years, this was an intriguing 
  prospect. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">True to her reputation for playing 
  with fire, Indira Gandhi allowed the problem in Punjab to fester until she 
  sent the army in and kill the Bhindranwale and tried positioning herself in 
  the media as the leader who had saved India from being fragmented, and, even 
  more saved Hindus from militant Sikhs. She did not live long to see herself as 
  the saviour that she intended projecting herself as - in 1984, she was 
  assassinated by two of her own bodyguards, both Sikhs. The then Sikh President 
  of India, an Indira Gandhi “rubber stamp” as he had been called by the media, 
  Giani Zail Singh, did not waste any time in calling her son, Rajiv Gandhi to 
  become Prime Minister after her. Congress party men went on the rampage in the 
  streets of the country killing thousands of Sikhs while the media reminded the 
  world of Zail Singh’s praise for the woman who made him President - he had 
  remarked that he would gladly work as a sweeper on the streets of Delhi if she 
  asked him to, an allusion to how high he held her for the honour of being made 
  President. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rajiv Gandhi would win the next 
  elections hands down but his mother’s insecurity would haunt him throughout 
  his second and only full term even with a brute majority of 400 Members of 
  Parliament out of 500 plus. He would allow the telecast of the Hindu epics, 
  the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, both of which were extensively rewritten to 
  give a political message that the original epics never had. The dialogues were 
  used to promote a political agenda that would get ever more shrill and 
  specific with the third and final television epic of this period, 
  Chandraprakash Dwivedi’s “Chanakya.” This serial, ostensibly about the author 
  of the ancient treatise “Arthashastra” on government, was filled with 
  references to the then political scenario in India and veiled hints about 
  foreign influences destroying India. The Greek invaders of Alexander and 
  Menander’s time were compared to the “western” influence of cable television 
  and arguments were made against democracy itself, telling audiences that 
  rulers had some kind of divine right to rule. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If a parallel could be drawn between 
  this propaganda and propaganda from the past, there was a striking resemblance 
  to the political situation as well as the propaganda of the Nazis in post 
  World War I Germany. The revival of Rama as an avenging god who went about 
  slaughtering his enemies, in stark contrast to the Valmiki Ramayana which 
  portrayed him as a gentle and kind man who was driven to war because of his 
  wife’s abduction was a parallel to the Nazis’ revival of the ancient pagan god 
  Wotan. The recreation of Chanakya as an ancient genius was a parallel to the 
  Nazis’ reinvention of the charlatan Paracelsus as a Germanic hero. Amid all of 
  this, in an attempt at outdoing Dwivedi and his saffron clad co-idealists in 
  their championing militant Hindusim, Rajiv Gandhi would make two mistakes 
  which would not just cost him and thousands of others their lives, they would 
  ensure that the BJP became a force that would rule India until 2004 when it 
  was very narrowly voted out of power. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Babri Masjid at Ayodhya, an 
  ancient mosque had been claimed by Hindus as the site of the birth of Rama for 
  some time. Fearing a breakdown of law and order, the British had closed the 
  site to both Hindus and Muslims and it had remained under lock and key in a 
  town where several other temples claimed to be Rama’s birthplace as well. 
  While a vast majority of Hindus had either forgotten or ignored this place as 
  had Muslims, Rajiv Gandhi would open it to allow the Hindus permission to 
  worship inside and give an agenda to the BJP on a platter. Buoyed by the 
  success of the Ramayana teleserial, the BJP would embark on a campaign to 
  recover what they claimed were places of worship that the Muslims had seized 
  from the Hindus in history. Rajiv Gandhi’s ineptitude would go further as he 
  would side with a viciously Hindu fundamentalist LTTE in Sri Lanka in it’s 
  battle for freedom from the Buddhist state. He would arm them, train them and 
  support them in their war against the Sri Lankan armed forces until 
  international pressure required that he pull back, following which he would 
  send the Indian army into Sri Lanka to fight them. In the meantime a massive 
  corruption scandal removed him from office and the BJP managed to seize power 
  in association with the left of centre Janata Dal. This National Front 
  government as it was called lasted barely two years and the subsequent 
  elections saw the Congress won after Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a Tamil 
  suicide bomber. The elections also saw the left parties eliminated and the BJP 
  emerge as the only real opposition to the Congress. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now would come the series of Rath 
  Yatras or chariot processions by the BJP’s number two man, L K Advani. One of 
  the few non Brahmins in the party and a militantly anti-Muslim who had lost 
  his properties in Pakistan during the Partition of India, he would take up the 
  job of galvanizing the largely indifferent Hindu population into action to 
  create a movement that led to the destruction of the structure of the mosque 
  on Dec 6th 1992. Subsequent riots would see thousands of Hindus and Muslims 
  killed all over the country and the repercussions were felt in neighboring Sri 
  Lanka and Bangladesh. Though the BJP did not win the immediate elections, it 
  had found a means to achieving power and in 1997 it would come to rule India 
  at the head of an 18 party coalition that would last briefly until reelection 
  in 1999 would bring it to power until 2004. During it’s rise, the BJP had 
  presided over the destruction of the Babri Masjid, after achieving power it 
  would see the destruction of dozens of churches in the states of Orissa and 
  Gujarat. It would see allies like the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra openly call for 
  supporting the LTTE in it’s fascist campaign to rid Sri Lanka of not only 
  Sinhala politicians but also of moderate Tamils who opposed it’s ideology. 
  Even in it’s electoral defeat, it would see it’s own tally of seats remain 
  almost intact while it’s allies fell like ninepins. A fringe party with only 
  two Parliamentarians had come to stay on the Indian scene as one of the two 
  most powerful parties in the land. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The situation in India in the late 
  1980s and 90s is very similar to most of the rest of the world today where we 
  see, on the one hand, a militant Islamic revival which has caused the deaths 
  of thousands of people in different parts of the world. Moderate Muslims have 
  seen themselves sidelined in many countries and countries that have moderate 
  Islamic beliefs like Egypt and Jordan find themselves fighting bloody battles 
  to keep groups like the Islamic Brotherhood at bay even while other countries 
  that have secular constitutions but Muslim majorities like Algeria and Turkey 
  find their very existence threatened by religious fundamentalism. It was 
  believed by many in India that Indira Gandhi allowed the Sikh fundamentalists 
  to become powerful because she was worried that in the Punjab the communists 
  were working to organise the farm labourers since she believed that a 
  religious fundamentalist would be the best force to fight an anti-religion 
  communist government. The west supported mujaheddin groups like Gulbuddin 
  Helmatyar’s Hezb-e-Islami and independent Muslim groups who would later join 
  the Taliban and Al Qaeda to fight the former USSR and the world saw the 
  horrors of 9/11. The rise in Islamic fundamentalism has been paralleled in a 
  rise in Christian fundamentalism in the USA, the country that suffered from 
  the attack of 9/11 and previous attacks on it’s embassies, ships and citizens 
  in different parts of the world. There are as open calls in the USA to make 
  the system more “Christian” as there have been in India by the BJP and it’s 
  VHP, Bajrang Dal and RSS allies to make it more “Hindu.” Israel, a major 
  flashpoint, has seen a militant Jewish government fighting militant 
  Palestinians who have chosen to abandon their more moderate leaders and 
  embrace violently fundamentalist groups like Hamas and Islamic Jehad. The 
  danger of an intolerant world where the major religions fight each other after 
  being hijacked by fundamentalists looms large before us like an India 
  magnified several times and made infinitely more dangerous. For, in the 
  various militancies and mini wars that have been fought in India since the 
  1980s about 200,000 people have been killed. In today’s world where rogue 
  scientists like Pakistan’s A Q Khan supply nuclear technology and weapons 
  components to their co-religionists on ideological grounds, the dangers that 
  face the rest of the world are much greater.</font></p>
