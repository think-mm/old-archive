		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Over the past two days, the US 
		media has been busily reporting the anger of senior Democratic Party 
		politicians over a serial on the incidents that led to 9/11. It has been 
		reported that the serial, a fictionalised account of the events that led 
		to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, has shown former US 
		President Bill Clinton and several of his cabinet in a poor light. The 
		timing of the serial could not have been more controversial, coming, as 
		it does, just before the anniversary of that murderous event and just 
		before campaigning begins for the elections to the Senate and the House 
		of Representatives. The serial also comes at a time when crackpot 
		conspiracy theorists have been claiming all kinds of things about the 
		attacks that brought the twin towers down, from calling it a conspiracy 
		by the US government itself to calling it a Jewish conspiracy to bring 
		infamy to Muslims. While this article is not an attempt at providing an 
		encyclopedic look into the background of events that led to the attacks, 
		it is the writer's intention to look at an event whose importance has 
		been consistently ignored by the US media though it is well known to 
		have been of considerable significance in the run up to 9/11 and in what 
		happened afterwards. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In May 1999, the Pakistani Army 
		used a technique that it had very successfully employed in the past to 
		capture parts of Kashmir when that region was an independent entity, not 
		the currently disputed territory between the nations of India and 
		Pakistan - it sent in thousands of tribal irregulars to occupy the 
		heights of Kargil in Indian Kashmir, in a replay of the first Kashmir 
		War of 1947-48. This time, as well, the raiders (about 5000 in number) 
		were Afghan and other tribals and their officers Pakistanis, in an 
		attempt by then Pakistani Army chief, Gen Parvez Musharraf to try to 
		capture parts of the territory which had otherwise been in Indian 
		control. This time, the tribals were Afghans from the Taliban government 
		with fighters also from what is now known as the Al Qaeda organisation. 
		What the raiders did not count on was the fact that Kargil is largely 
		Shia in population, a community that is very suspicious of groups that 
		are Sunni extremists like the tribal and Qaeda irregulars who came in to 
		occupy the region. It was not long before the residents of Kargil 
		alerted the Indian government to the massive scale of infiltration and 
		war ensued. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Indian Army soon mobilised 
		more than 200,000 soldiers to attack the raiders though it found the 
		deployment of the soldiers extremely difficult due to the rugged 
		terrain, and air attacks by the Indian Air Force were repulsed on the 
		first day of fighting when the irregulars used Stinger missiles that ahd 
		been given to them to fight the Soviet Army in decades past were used to 
		bring down two aircraft very shortly after bombing commenced. As Indian 
		soldiers fought fierce battles to dislodge and kill as many of the 
		raiders as possible, then US President Bill Clinton summoned the then 
		Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharief to Washington and brokered an 
		end to the fighting. The carrot dangled before India was reportedly the 
		lifting of sanctions against several Indian entities that ahd been 
		involved in the nuclear sector, sanctions that were imposed after the 
		Indian nuclear tests a year earlier in 1998. The Indian Army which had 
		surrounded the raiders by this time and was busily killing them by the 
		hundreds was persuaded to leave an opening through which they could 
		return to Pakistan and then to Afghanistan from there. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It has been variously reported 
		that Mr Clinton was worried that India was readying to blockade the 
		Pakistani port of Karachi and that the conflict could possibly lead to a 
		nuclear war when he stepped in to bring an end to hostilities. It has 
		also been argued that the possibility of what was clearly a local 
		conflict expanding into a nuclear war was zero - why would Pakistan wage 
		a nuclear war over the fates of Afghan tribals and sundry Islamist 
		fighters from different parts of the world? Whatever the case may have 
		been, the fact is that Mr Clinton's decision led to the lives of 
		thousands od Taliban/Qaeda fighters being saved, fighters who would 
		disperse into Pakistan and Afghanistan to continue fighting, this time 
		against the US and it's allies after the attacks of 9/11. The facts also 
		are clear as far as Mr Clinton's interaction with the Taliban is 
		concerned - Pakistani journalist Ahmad Rashid has clearly documented the 
		Clinton government's attempts at engaging the Taliban in dialogue when 
		Argentinian petroleum company Bridas Corp (since acquired by a US 
		corporation) seemed the leader in a plan to market Afghan Natural Gas to 
		the world over US rival Unocal. Whatever murky incidents may have taken 
		place within the US government at that time would never come to light 
		and they are only known to Mr Clinton and his aides. The facts, and 
		there are many of them at that, show that he was more than a little 
		interested in engaging the Taliban, hosts to Al Qaeda in dialogue than 
		in looking on them as a repressive, murderous force that would later 
		kill thousands of people in different parts of the world. As a darling 
		of the US media, Mr Clinton may be able to get his way and get many 
		unpleasant facts about his own incompetence suppressed, especially 
		because his wife currently considers herself a possible Democratic 
		Presidential candidate. In the rest of the world, especially in South 
		Asia, there are many who would laugh at this suppression of facts by a 
		major US political party and by the US media in collusion.</font></p>
