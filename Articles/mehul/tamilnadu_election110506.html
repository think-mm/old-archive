		<p>&nbsp;<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I type this article, 
		Indian voters in the state of Tamilnadu, my home state and home for 35 
		years have sent a clear message like their counterparts in the rest of 
		India did in early 2004 - the Hindu fundamentalist Jayalalitha 
		government has been resoundingly voted out and is in the last stages of 
		being confirmed as defeated. J Jayalalitha was elected five years ago 
		with an overwhelming mandate in a state where the people were fed up 
		with slow economic growth under her arch rivals, the DMK, which has won 
		today. She also delivered on the economic front with a slew of new 
		businesses attracted to the state from the neighboring states of Andhra 
		Pradesh and Karnataka , but it was her old, dictatorial ways and her 
		extreme devotion to Hindu fundamentalism and to the caste system where 
		she was born as a Brahmin that proved her undoing. The lesson in her 
		defeat is one for all Indian politicians to ponder - compared to wealth, 
		people prefer their individual liberties more.</font><p align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><br>
		As a state, Tamilnadu was the home state of the great social reformer, 
		Thanthai Periyar (born E V Ramasamy Naicker) who agitated throughout his 
		long life for the rights of the discriminated Hindu castes . It also is 
		a state with the world’s biggest atheist movement, the Dravidar Kazhagam 
		and yet it also sends more pilgrims to the annual pilgrimages at 
		Sabarimala and Tirupati than probably the states where these Hindu 
		shrines are based, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh respectively, send their 
		own residents. And yet, under Periyar’s teaching and instructions, the 
		Tamils have made strident reforms even when they are religious - the 
		state does not name roads and streets after any leader using their caste 
		names in a public distancing of itself from the Hindu caste system, and 
		this move has no opposition at all from even devout Hindus. And, more 
		importantly, both major parties there, the DMK and the AIADMK, are 
		offshoots of the vehemently atheist social movement of Periyar, the DK.</font><p align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><br>
		To some extent or the other, both the DMK and the AIADMK have deviated 
		from Periyar’s strict atheist norms - his statue near Napier Park has 
		these words on it, “There is no god, there is no god, there is no god at 
		al. He who believes in god is a fool, he who worships god is a 
		barbarian, he who propagates god is a scoundrel.” But the late beloved 
		leader of the DMK who broke away from the DK socialist movement, Anna 
		Durai, broke away espousing his view that there was “only one community 
		of people and only one god,” in a departure from the ideology of his 
		mentor and ideological guide. While DMK leader M Karunanidhi has been an 
		atheist in his personal life, he has tolerated religiosity among his 
		followers more as a matter of political expediency though he faces 
		lawsuits from the Hindu fundamentalists for some statem,ents of his 
		including one where he is reported to have said that being a devout 
		Hindu was like being a thief (of the liberty of the discriminated 
		castes.) But it was in the AIADMK under Jayalalitha’s mentor and late 
		Chief Minister and former film star M G Ramachandran that public 
		religiosity made a comeback in the state - he was a devotee of a temple 
		in Karnataka and she followed his religiosity with her own public 
		religiosity.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		That said, there was a difference - MGR as he was popularly known, was a 
		man who was of poor meansas a youth, and he did not belong to any caste 
		that had a place in Hinduism. He identified with the suffering of the 
		low castes and, while he was religious, was sufficiently influenced by 
		Periyar and Anna Durai to share their egalitarian ideals. It was his 
		empathy for the poor - whether it was a grand gesture meant to attract 
		votes or a matter of fact is something that historians are divided upon 
		- that made him unbeatable in elections throughout his life. Other than 
		the Marxists in West Bengal, there is perhaps no party other than the 
		AIADMK under MGR that never lost an election in India. With Jayalalitha 
		it has been a roller coaster ride - elected overwhelmingly once, she was 
		voted out equally overwhelmingly losing even her personal seats in the 
		next election following which she won again to be ousted this time. And, 
		while her rule was always controversial, this recent government showed 
		her saffron colors quite clearly to anyone who tried to look.</font><p align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana"><br>
		She started in an alliance with the Hindu fundamentalist BJP when she 
		won five years ago, and rapidly worked to prove her own saffron 
		credentials by banning conversions from Hinduism as a first step in 
		showing her religious colors. This was followed by a rule that was 
		authoritarian in the extreme, laying down a Hindutvaite code of behavior 
		that extended to virtually every aspect of Tamilnadu residents’ lives. 
		Plays that she considered “obscene” were banned, Eve Ensler’s “Vagina 
		Monologues” being a prominent example. Discotheques were regularly 
		raided and their patrons beaten up by policemen who seemed to get away 
		with just about anything. Two wheelers were stopped at night at several 
		points on every major Chennai city road and checked, their riders 
		frisked, while car drivers who were obviously more affluent and probably 
		well connected never were. And, her policemen went into the city’s 
		famous Anna Nagar Park and arrested hundreds of adult couples there, 
		photographed and fingerprinted them and put their pictures in yellow 
		rags as if they were those of wanted criminals. It did appear as if the 
		common individual had no rights under her dispensation save what she 
		chose to grant him/her. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		Even those VIPs whom she did not like were extremely unsafe - her own 
		opponent Karunanidhi was brutally arrested and manhandled on television 
		in a message of intimidation to his party cadres . She also sent 
		policemen into the offices of the newspaper The Hindu to arrest two 
		reporters who wrote pieces that had been critical of her behavior in the 
		state legislative assembly. It was as if she was monarch of all that she 
		surveyed, her right there being none to dispute. Fractured, weak and 
		ineffective governments at the Center in Delhi could not rein her in and 
		neither could India’s atrociously inefficient judicial system, the less 
		about which is said, the better. Until she came up against the one force 
		that she could not get away with oppressing forever - the Tamil people. 
		Freed as they were from the hegemony of caste oppression by Periyar and 
		subsequent leaders, they did not take kindly to Jayalalitha’s poll 
		alliance with caste absed parties. As a matter of fact, even the caste 
		based parties on the DMK side do not seem to have done well at all. A 
		state with mostly religious people and the world’s largest atheist 
		movement side by side had decided that enough was enough. Jayalalitha 
		was voted out, joining her erstwhile allies now turned enemies, the 
		Hindu fundamentalist BJP, on the opposition benches. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		There is a pattern in this for anyone who cares to look. India has 
		democratic elections despite all it’s faults and where there is 
		democracy, it may take time, but fundamentalists cannot rule. The same 
		would be true of almost every other country where fundamentalists hold 
		sway - perhaps, the reason for their turning whole nations into 
		theocratic dictatorships is that they know the dangers of electoral 
		politics to their religious authority. Hence we see emasculated 
		“democracies” like Iran where a supreme council of mullahs decide who 
		may stand for election at best and governments like the Taliban or the 
		Saudi monarchy where there is absolute rule by theocrats at worst. It is 
		obvious that I the USA, a few months before senate elections, the 
		Christian Right Wing seems set for defeat in both the Senate as well as 
		in the House of Representatives., and elections in as diverse regions as 
		Latin America, Europe and India have shown what can happen when the 
		people are given a chance to assert their rights. Hopefully, this 
		message would carry to the extreme religious corners of the world and 
		make some theocrats uneasy - we are probably not in as violent a world 
		as Denis Diderot’s where he hoped that he would see the last king 
		strangled with the intestines of the last priest, but today’s world has 
		shown that the vote is a perfect instrument to help cast religious 
		fundamentalist leaders into the dustbin.</font><p>&nbsp;</div>
