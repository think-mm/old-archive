					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some years ago, when 
					M D Gopalakrishnan, the then editor of <i>
					<a href="http://www.themronline.com/">The Modern Rationalist</a></i> 
					and the owner of Emerald Publishers died, I considered 
					taking a job up in the UAE. Two of the major newspapers 
					there had openings and a cousin who lives there asked me to 
					apply for them since, as a printing technologist, he knew 
					people in both companies and could put a word in. That was 
					when I talked to my senior and friend Rajen Menon who was a 
					former Illustrated Weekly of India staffer and who had made 
					a very successful career out of writing independently on 
					AIDS and other health related issues after the Illustrated 
					Weekly closed down. His advice to me was simple, &quot;Don’t go. 
					You’ll hate it there.&quot; As someone who had never been to the 
					Middle East then but who was fascinated by the area, it’s 
					culture and the “differentness” from India, I asked him to 
					explain what he meant. “Check out the websites of both Gulf 
					News and the Khaleej Times,” he said, “There is very little 
					’news’ in them. You’ll find a lot on sports, on 
					entertainment and on silly local events. You are not going 
					to find news or analyses of any sort. Yes, you’ll get paid 
					well but you’ll wait for your contract to end so that you 
					could rush back to India and accept a lower paid but 
					otherwise better job there.” </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I did not take the 
					job up as other options opened up in India itself in the 
					meantime, but I made it my hobby to read both the major Gulf 
					newspapers as regularly as I could. To be fair to them, they 
					did carry more news progressively from 1998 until now albeit 
					with an obvious restraint as if Big Brother was watching 
					with a club in his hands. Every day there had to be at least 
					one article about visa regulations for expats, something 
					that worried every non UAE citizen who lived there as the 
					rules were known to change on the whims of the rulers and 
					bureaucrats, a full 20% of column space would be devoted to 
					sports, there would be a mandatory anti-Israel article as 
					well as, after 9/11, an article every day criticizing 
					terrorists while insisting that they were not Muslims and 
					that Islam itself had nothing to do with the actions of 
					these murderers. It was obvious not just to journalists but 
					also to any interested reader that these newspapers were 
					operating under severe restrictions and had to keep looking 
					at those in government for their approval every time. It was 
					obvious that while there was no open censorship, there was a 
					clear set of rules that newspaper owners were supposed to 
					adhere to. And this was in what is considered the most 
					“free” of all the Gulf Co-operation Council countries, a 
					country that ostensibly relied on trading, tourism and 
					services for it’s vast wealth as it had little oil compared 
					to it’s neighbors. Was I surprised when the
					<a href="../avijit/mm_banned_uae.html">country’s government 
					owned ISPs began blocking Mukto-Mona</a>? From what I saw of 
					the newspapers there, the ‘ban’ was not at all surprising. 
					Since Mukto-Mona happens to be far from the UAE authorities’ 
					jurisdiction, the one way to keep the residents of that 
					country from accessing Mukto-Mona and it’s ideas would be to 
					block access to it on the net without banning it officially.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What this says about 
					the country that has done this, as well as it’s neighbors 
					who are likely to implement this decision themselves very 
					shortly, is considerable. An open ban would have been 
					something that attracted widespread publicity and would have 
					shown the UAE government in poor light especially as the 
					country tries hard to project a tolerant and liberal image 
					of itself to the world. There has not been anything 
					offensive that has been published on Mukto-Mona as far as we 
					can remember. Yes, there have been more than several 
					criticisms of religion, and this has been equally of all 
					religions, not just the primary religion of the UAE. There 
					have been criticisms of several governments with little if 
					anything being written about a country that matters as 
					little to the rest of the world like the UAE does, not to 
					mention it’s complete insignificance to international 
					affairs. Thugs in governments that intimidate journalists 
					often have exaggerated notions of their importance to the 
					world. While I wonder what other websites could have been 
					‘banned’ by the UAE in this way, the fact is that this is 
					going to do little more than expose the country’s ways to 
					the world at large. Shame on a country that cannot tolerate 
					facts, debate and honest opinions. The UAE has not 
					distinguished itself in any positive way. This decision to 
					block the Mukto-Mona website illustrates not only it’s 
					thuggery as far as the news is concerned, ironically, it 
					also illustrates the country’s helplessness in doing 
					anything about a website that is dedicated to discussing 
					anything important that comes up before it. The UAE 
					authorities, smug in their little sheikdom, need to know 
					that there are far more people outside their borders than 
					within them and we shall work hard to show the world more 
					about their country. </font></p>
