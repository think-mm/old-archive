		<p>&nbsp;<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The news that the 
		British legal system had functioning sharia courts with arbitration 
		status came in a sensational scoop by two large newspapers in that 
		country: &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Telegraph.&quot; Apart from the small numbers 
		of Islamic clerics who had managed to persuade the British government to 
		constitute these courts and a very small number of people who had gone 
		to these courts to ask for adjudication in matters of family law, much 
		of Britain's Muslim community itself was as unaware of the courts' 
		existence as the rest of the country was. Subsequent investigation 
		showed that at about the time these courts were quietly permitted, the 
		British government had allowed Jewish courts as well, functioning on 
		Jewish religious law, to adjudicate in disputes within Jewish families. 
		On the one hand, this appeared like an attempt by the British government 
		to liberalize its judicial system and make the handling of family 
		disputes acceptable to migrants who were from different cultures than 
		the vast majority of native-born British people. But, it is clear, when 
		reading between the lines, that the whole business is little more than a 
		cynical power grab being attempted by the Labour government while vested 
		interests in Britain's huge Christian community push their agenda using 
		Muslims and Jews as cannon-fodder. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Gordon Brown's embattled 
		government cannot have been ignorant of the Canadian Liberal Party's 
		attempt at trying to force sharia courts upon the Canadian people in the 
		run up to the last Canadian general elections. Then Canadian Prime 
		Minister, Paul Martin, found himself accused of corruption and nepotism 
		along with Ontario Premier Dalton Mc Guinty and both concocted an 
		attempt at gaining the support of Canada's Muslim community to try and 
		win elections that threatened to consign both men to the dustbin of 
		history. Unfortunately for them, both men tried this openly, mooting the 
		idea along with a bunch of mullahs and posing for the newspapers, 
		drawing the ire not just of the Canadian non-Muslim population, but also 
		of active liberal Muslim activists including Mukto-Mona's own Hasan 
		Mahmud (who writes under the pen name &quot;Fatemolla&quot;) and Tarek Fatah. The 
		resulting uproar when women Mps in Canada came out publicly to join the 
		liberal Muslims to show their opposition to this proposal cutting across 
		party lines killed the bill and also saw Paul Martin shunted out in the 
		elections though Mc Guinty managed to scrape through because of the 
		support that he ahd managed tog et among the fundamentalist mullahs 
		among others. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Gordon Brown learned his lessons 
		well from the Martin – Mc Guinty debacle. He must have sounded the 
		Archibshop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, to discuss his proposal to 
		grant fundamentalists in the Jewish and Muslim communities permission to 
		run religious courts. With centuries of religious cunning guiding him, 
		Williams grabbed an opportunity that he must never have dreamed would 
		ever come up – in February 2008, he made a speech that was widely 
		publicized, supporting the idea of sharia courts. Williams was denounced 
		by his own followers while the secular public condemned him, but, in 
		supporting this idea, the Archbishop had managed to pull off a huge 
		coup: if Jewish and Muslim religious courts were permitted by a weak 
		British administration out to gain votes to win a looming and tough 
		election, then it would certainly be easy for Williams to ask for, and 
		get Christian religious courts instituted afterwards, in demanding his 
		pound of flesh. A toothless Prime Minister like Gordon Brown would be 
		helpless to deny the Christian community the very same privileges that 
		he had already granted the Jewish and Muslim communities, and, from a 
		legal standpoint, a precedent had already been set for religious courts 
		with two religions permitted their own courts with full arbitration 
		powers. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So far, Brown's sly introduction 
		of these courts has not caused any major commotion in the British media 
		after the initial uproar in the press. As the world economy slides 
		towards a very uncertain and gloomy future, Britain has been hit, 
		perhaps, harder than even the USA by the huge American housing mess and 
		the corresponding slide in the American financial sector. The average 
		Briton is probably more worried about his / her pension and savings and 
		about property values in a country which saw the highest increase in 
		home prices in the world than in the religious courts that now operate 
		with impunity in the country thanks to their being granted permission to 
		function by a devious politician who heads the country. It is also 
		likely that in this mess, Brown will win the next elections thanks to 
		the support of the fundamentalists who stand to gain from his decision 
		to allow Jewish and sharia courts. As long as an issue is not in the 
		public eye, people are not going to base their voting decisions upon it, 
		even in a country like the UK where the population is as politically 
		aware as it is. It is my guess that the Anglican church, and later, the 
		Catholic and other churches will strike. After re-election, Brown will 
		continue in office but as a lame-duck Prime Minister. The churches will 
		step in to demand their pound of flesh. And Brown will have no option 
		but to give them ten pounds for every one that they ask for. Take the 
		huge number of Christians in the UK as compared to the Jews and Muslims, 
		and, it would be a question of time before the Christian fundamentalists 
		would be able to toss aside the sharia courts and the Jewish ones as 
		they impose their own religious ideas on the country. In the end, the 
		sharia proponents, the Jewish court proponents and Gordon Brown would be 
		together in eating crow along with the vast majority of secular Britons 
		who would be deceived into this state of recalcitrance by the 
		machinations of a power-hungry and slimy politician and an even more sly 
		and cunning fundamentalist in the Archbishop of Canterbury.</font></p>
