	<div class="doc-layout-body">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<font size="2">The first 
		time I met the late Mr M D Gopalakrishnan it was at his office which 
		shared a Publishing office and a book shop two doors away from my 
		father's clinic on Anna Salai in Chennai, more popularly known as Mount 
		Road. He was a well known atheist and had even been written about by V S 
		Naipaul in one of his travelogues through India. It was late December 
		and as the Pongal festival was imminent, there were a number of 
		religious Hindus preparing to go on a pilgrimage to the Kerala shrine of 
		Sabarimalai. You could see about one in ten people wearing black dhotis 
		and the telltale beads that signified the fact that they were involved 
		in a 30 day penance before the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
		</font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Women who could menstruate were strictly prohibited from going to the 
		temple and only girls upto 8 years of age or very old women were allowed 
		and the crowds grew every year because of the system designating 
		devotees who went there. Someone who went three times became a &quot;Guru 
		Swamy&quot; and he would then have the responsibility of taking eight new 
		people every year. Needless to say, the temple and transport operators 
		loved this, as did clothing merchants who sold black dhoties because it 
		meant additional business every year and vastly increased revenues. 
		While pyramid business schemes were illegal overall, the temple 
		authorities had managed to create the ultimate pyramid scheme, one to 
		beat frauds like Amway, Herbalife and all others by a magnitude that 
		could not be comprehended by anyone who did not know the intricacies of 
		this particular system. And, it meant that poor families would end up 
		begging for money to go - nopt going there after someone had been there 
		once was a sin and the gullible would either borrow money or beg from 
		others to manage to make the trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		One such family came to the office and asked MDG as he was popularly 
		known, for money. He did not chase them away - he asked them to sit down 
		and slowly analysed the entire fraud committed by the Sabarimalai system 
		on it's devotees to them. He also asked them how long they would be away 
		- it turned out that the man had two sons who would have missed fifteen 
		days of school in making this pilgrimage as they were going to walk a 
		considerable portion of the way to make it even more difficult for 
		themselves. Suffering was supposed to bring some kind of divine gains on 
		this trip. MDG convinced them in his own way and then asked what the 
		boys' school fees were. He gave them money to cover three months' school 
		fees and sent them away. We would not know whether the man used the 
		money for the pilgrimage or whether he stayed away and his boys went to 
		school&nbsp; with the money. But this was what symbolized the man and 
		the way he worked. It was an example that I would never forget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Sabarimalai had it's devotees even from the wealthier sections - one of 
		MDG's neighbours&nbsp; who is a good friend of mine as well, is a 
		gentleman who works as an officer at the Food Corporation of India in 
		Chennai. A perennially happy and helpful man who is ever eager to help 
		anyone requiring assistance, his wife is a very religious Hindu lady 
		while he is an agnostic. They have two children - a daughter, who has 
		taken after her father and is probably a step ahead of him in being an 
		atheist and a son who was religious at the time, influenced by his 
		mother. The boy wore a thread charm on his wrist, and as he played 
		cricket every evening at the grounds in Lakshmi Nagar, a wealthy suburb 
		North of Chennai, sweat would go into the thread and get absorbed by it, 
		irritating his skin and causing rashes. MDG took it on himself to talk 
		to the boy about this and convinced him to get the charm off - he did 
		not bring religiosity itself up - but pointed out the health issue. When 
		the boy removed the charm and threw it away, he held a party for several 
		families to celebrate this success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Emerald Publishers was a highly profitable company. MDG had been a 
		researcher in Economics and Anthropology at the Madras University and 
		had then left active academics to work in the publishing division at S 
		Chand and Co before leaving it to start publishing textbooks. As a 
		commitment to the Rationalist cause, he would spend a considerable share 
		of his profits on promoting rationalist literature. I doubt that he ever 
		made money on the sale of the rationalist books, but it was a passion 
		with him that would stay until the end of his life. A passion that kept 
		him from selling any astrology or similar pseudo-scientific or religious 
		book in his shop, though he could have made millions if not more by 
		selling that kind of material from the prime location where his shop 
		stood. </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		After that day, I would spend many months over the subsequent four years 
		of his life with him and his wife Prof Thavamani, currently Principal of 
		the Ethiraj College for Women, one of India's most prestigious colleges 
		at their home working on various campaigns and assisting on editing the 
		Modern Rationalist, the English language monthly published by the 
		Dravidar Kazhagam. Theirs was a marriage made under an atheist 
		commitment - MDG's first wife was no more and Prof Thavamani took it to 
		look after him in his ailing days. He had suffered three heart attacks 
		and was physically weak though he did not hesitate to push himself as 
		much as he could especially as far as his atheism was concerned. India 
		was slowly falling to the Hindu fundamentalist BJP at the time and he 
		would often be critical of the country for &quot;losing it&quot; and voting the 
		Hindutvaites to power. And, to balance this, he would publish an English 
		translation of his good friend K A Francis' &quot;Bibliya Ayyangal&quot; which he 
		renamed as &quot;The Bible, A Great Farce&quot; pointing out the various 
		discrepancies in it to people who read it. <b>We would laugh over the fact 
		that Hindu fundamentalists would often quote from the KA Francis book as 
		it was serialized in MR telling their audiences that &quot;even an atheist 
		organization&quot; condemned the Christian scriptures, when, in fact, we were 
		doing nothing of the sort. </b>The fact was that the Editor in Chief of the Dravidar Kazhagam, MR K Veeramani was in the process of writing &quot;Githaiyin 
		Marupakkam&quot; at the time, a masterpiece on the Bhagavad Gita and it's 
		casteist principles which were to anger those who selectively quoted 
		from MR to criticise Christianity. MDG would take the unpopular decision 
		to call for a revocation of the ban on the Satanic Verses as well and 
		even while he criticized India would enthusiastically celebrate the 
		national festivals of Republic Day and Independence Day with family and 
		friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		He was an enthusiastic Rotarian and would encourage me to speak at 
		various Rotary clubs on highly controversial issues, setting up debates 
		with astrologers, numerologists and spokespeople for different religious 
		groups to convey the atheist viewpoint. And this was where, when I met 
		my wife, he would suggest that I think about marrying her in the future. 
		I had come through a badly mangled relationship at the time with an 
		Indian American daughter of a friend of the family, and my wife was a 
		student at the Rotary School of Nursing. As a class topper and a 
		Secretary of the statewide Student Nurses Union, she would be present at 
		Rotary meetings as well as at the hospital where he would be frequently 
		admitted when his health slipped. Sadly, he did not survive to attend 
		our wedding though Prof Thavamani would proudly tell the guests present 
		that it was a wedding in her family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		</font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		He did not, though, go gentle into the good night. The IHEU would hold 
		it's first convention in Mumbai and he would ask me to go there knowing 
		that he was slipping away, telling me that he was going to join halfway 
		through. But <b>before I left, I would get to see a dose of his soft sense 
		of humour - his doctor told him while he was in the Intermediate Care 
		Unit that he would&nbsp; do his best and let god do the rest. MDG called 
		the doctor close - he did not have the energy to speak loudly - and then 
		asked him if, indeed, god was handling his treatment, the doctor would 
		still charge him his fees?</b> As his doctor left shocked, he laughed and 
		laid back in bed, slowly falling asleep. Two days later, halfway through 
		the convention, we received the news that he was no more. In death as in 
		life, he broke convention - his children tried to donate his body to 
		medical research but there was no hospital geared for this. And the, in 
		a final, defiant farewell, his daughter Mrs Ponni Selvi would light the 
		cremation pyre, contrary to Hindu custom. His son Mr G Olivannan runs 
		Emerald Publishers these days, continuing his father's business though 
		the retail business has been reduced and the stress is on publishing 
		more than on sales.&nbsp; This is my tribute to a man who influenced my 
		career as an atheist columnist and whom I shall always remember. What 
		was most noteworthy was his affection for people, an affection that I am 
		convinced - as was everyone who knew him - was born out of his atheist 
		principles.</font><p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
