		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Two Justices of the Supreme 
		Court of India, S.B. Sinha and P.K. Balasubramanyan in delivering a 
		judgement over a dispute between liquor distillers and the Maharashtra 
		government, have directed the Central and State governments of India to 
		“reduce consumption” of liquor, “gradually leading to prohibition.” Are 
		these men serious? Do they have nothing better to do? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Indian judicial system has 
		shown itself as being utterly inefficient of late with it’s complete 
		misuse last year by sundry thugs who manipulated it to publicly 
		humiliate the Tamil actress Khushboo for a statement that she made about 
		virginity and double standards between men and women in traditional 
		marriages on this subject. Instead of throwing this frivolous lawsuit 
		out, the Chennai High Court sat on it’s benches doing nothing while the 
		poor woman had to run from pillar to post and then to different courts 
		hundreds of miles apart to face sundry lower courts because her 
		tormentors had cleverly filed lawsuits against her across the state. 
		There is, also, the fact that for years there have been claims by 
		successive governments and governments about reducing the backlog of 
		cases in the judicial system in order to ensure speedy justice. And yet, 
		after all this high sounding talk, this is what happens - either judges 
		refuse to throw frivolous lawsuits out, or they waste valuable time and 
		public funds in pronouncing on their pet, personal whims, grabbing at 
		constitutional straws for support. The whole spectacle is one of a 
		Kafkaesque society on the one hand and of a farce on the other. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India is a country where thanks 
		to British colonial laws and the far older and more restrictive Hindu 
		religious laws, the state has immense authority. There is practically no 
		way that people in power can be held accountable and if it is true that 
		politicians can be voted out, it is equally true that judicial 
		ineptitude cannot be countered in any way. Some years ago, the Supreme 
		Court of India admitted a patently frivolous lawsuit against the writer 
		Arundhati Roy by some policemen who said that she had attempted to kill 
		them. When the charge was preposterous and would not have served to 
		punish her, the court found her response to the charges “arrogant” and 
		imprisoned her briefly after making her write an apology. An Iranian 
		religious court publicly hanged a 16 year old girl at the time because 
		it felt that she was rude and that her responses had been cheeky. It is 
		obvious where the Supreme Court of India gets it’s inspiration from.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And now, this moral policing 
		from the very top. Two judges, both old enough to have seen what a 
		horrible mess prohibition was under the Morarji Desai government across 
		India during the Janata Party’s rule as well as in the localized 
		prohibition in Andhra Pradesh and Kerala states under Chandrababu Naidu 
		and A K Antony respectively, would rather send the government and the 
		law enforcement machinery on a chase to ban the drinking of alcohol. 
		They would like to forget the fact that the already overburdened law 
		enforcement machinery is barely able to do it’s job of keeping law and 
		order in most of India and completely unable to do anything in other 
		parts of the country especially when it comes to fighting the Naxalites 
		who practically control huge swathes of India and run a parallel 
		government. They would like to forget the fact that they preside over a 
		system that has singularly failed in every attempt at doing it’s own 
		duty in a timely manner over at least twenty five years and burden it 
		with completely unnecessary new tasks presuming that they would want 
		those manufacturing liquor to be prosecuted and punished once 
		Prohibition is reintroduced. And, in India, they are supreme - nothing 
		can be done but take note of their pronouncements and act on them now 
		that they have spoken. Are they serious? Are they wise? Do they really 
		have the wisdom to hold such a powerful chair and such immense authority 
		over the nation? The more this kind of activity emanates from their 
		courts, the more the term “Kangaroo Court” seems to resemble their 
		office. In a country that touts itself as the “world’s largest 
		democracy” this is beyond a doubt a candidate for the world’s worst 
		disgrace. Grow up, gentlemen, this is simply silly.</font></p>
