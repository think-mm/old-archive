	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">GENEVA (Reuters) - Humanist and 
	atheist groups around the world are looking to boost their profile in 2005 
	to counter religious fundamentalism and efforts by some Western leaders to 
	relaunch faith as a keystone of national life. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Under pressure from the rise of 
	militant Islam, Vatican activism in the European Union and the re-election 
	of a &quot;born-again&quot; Christian to the White House, they feel they must resist 
	to ensure the ideas of secularism survive and spread. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;In the face of the religious 
	onslaught on Humanist values, we have to speak out and get our message 
	over,&quot; says Roy Brown, Swiss-based president of the International Humanist 
	and Ethical Union (IHEU) which links groups totaling millions of members.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Two central events will be a World 
	Atheist Conference at Vijayawada in India in early January and the IHEU's 
	World Congress in July at the Paris headquarters of UNESCO, the United 
	Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We must work hard to combat the 
	encroachment of religion on public policy and on the rights of non-believers 
	everywhere,&quot; said IHEU executive director Babu Gogineni. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Atheists, who see no evidence for 
	the existence of a deity, and Humanists, who are mainly atheists but include 
	some believers, share that core concern: to keep religion out of politics 
	and limit it to the private sphere. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They draw their inspiration from 
	freethinkers down the ages, from ancient Greek and Indian philosophers 
	through the 18th century Enlightenment that shaped much of modern political 
	thinking in Europe and North America. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#008000">PRINCIPLES 
	ATTACKED </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But they see key Humanist principles 
	-- respect for human rights and racial and sexual equality with morality 
	based on reason rather than on the dictates of a supreme being through a 
	holy book -- as under assault, and not just in Muslim countries. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The re-election in November of 
	George W. Bush, U.S. Humanists fear, strengthened the influence of Christian 
	fundamentalists dedicated to restoring the Bible, &quot;God's word,&quot; to a central 
	role in public life and foreign policy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many of Bush's supporters appear to 
	see the war in Iraq in the same terms as the president, and Muslim 
	fundamentalists, as one arena of a cosmic struggle between good and evil in 
	which what Humanists would regard as crimes are permissible on both sides.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bush's triumph has also boosted 
	opponents of abortion and homosexuality, as well as supporters of 
	Intelligent Design (ID) which rejects evolution -- the development of all 
	life on Earth from lower forms through natural selection of the fittest -- 
	as elaborated by 19th century British naturalist Charles Darwin. The ID 
	movement emerged from the ranks of U.S. creationists, who believe the Bible 
	is literally correct and that their God created the world and all in it. ID 
	limits itself to arguing that an intelligence must have shaped life. In many 
	U.S. states, fundamentalists on school boards ensure that creationism -- 
	taught widely until the late 1960s -- is still present in some form. ID 
	supporters are now demanding that their beliefs be taught alongside 
	evolution. Last month British philosopher Anthony Flew, long a champion of 
	unbelief, announced to the dismay of some fellow atheists that he was now 
	convinced an intelligence must have provided the spark of life and perhaps 
	even done some designing. His &quot;conversion&quot; was greeted with delight on 
	creationist and Catholic Web sites. But Flew hastened to clarify that he 
	believed that the intelligence involved was not the Christian, Jewish or 
	Muslim &quot;personal&quot; deity, and that there is no &quot;afterlife.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#008000">GOD OF THE GAPS
	</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Atheist scientist-thinkers, like 
	British biologist Richard Dawkins, said Flew had simply come to &quot;the god of 
	the gaps&quot; -- a view held by some philosophers but few scientists that some 
	&quot;force&quot; must have been at play because science has not pinned down how life 
	could have begun otherwise. In Britain, many Humanists feel that Prime 
	Minister Tony Blair -- a strong religious believer -- and members of his 
	government are undermining secular traditions. They point to his promotion 
	of faith schools run by various religious communities, including two 
	financed by a fundamentalist businessman where creationism is taught as 
	science. Blair's push for a new law that would protect all believers from 
	&quot;incitement to hate&quot; on the grounds of their faith -- a key demand of Muslim 
	activists -- is bound to restrict criticism of religion as such, Humanists 
	argue. His readiness to bend government policies to the views of &quot;faith&quot; 
	leaders, they say, has led religious hard-liners to demand ever more 
	concessions on social and cultural issues such as limiting the right to 
	stage plays that might offend religion. In most Muslim countries, religion 
	and politics are closely intertwined and apostasy or renunciation of the 
	faith is often a criminal offense. Penalties include execution, but 
	&quot;apostates&quot; are routinely treated as outcasts and harassed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Secular and evangelical Christian 
	groups launched a campaign at the United Nations last year to convince 
	Islamic leaders to work to change this, but to little effect. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" color="#008000">SOME ADVANCES
	</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However Humanists see some advances 
	over the past year in Europe, Asia and even in Africa where atheists have 
	begun to organize. In Europe, Vatican efforts to have the EU constitution 
	include a reference to the continent's Christian heritage were blocked. The 
	European Parliament voted to bar a traditionalist Italian Catholic from 
	becoming the new justice commissioner. France's ban on Muslim headscarves in 
	state schools was imposed in September with few problems, despite warnings 
	that it would unleash protests and alienate many in Europe's largest Islamic 
	minority. In Spain, the Socialists replaced the Catholic-inspired Popular 
	Party after its decade in power and began a series of secular reforms 
	angering the Church hierarchy, including a move to allow gay marriage. The 
	Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party lost power in India's general 
	elections to the firmly secular Congress Party. Even at the United Nations 
	there was good news from for Humanists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladeshi writer and medical 
	doctor Taslima Nasrin, living in exile after criticizing Islam and an active 
	campaigner for the rights of women and the non-religious, was awarded a 
	UNESCO prize for promoting cultural tolerance. But at the same time a 
	Vatican campaign led to the world body adding &quot;Christianophobia&quot; to &quot;Islamophobia&quot; 
	and anti-Semitism as issues its human rights bodies report -- a sign for 
	many that religious forces are reinforcing their grip.&nbsp; </font></p>
