		<font size="2"></font>
		<p>&nbsp;<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Renowned 
		Bangladesh-born writer and humanist Dr Taslima Nasrin returned to India 
		after being held under virtual house-imprisonment for several months 
		prior to her departure from India in March this year. When she was 
		unceremoniously bundled out of the country to Sweden, she had declared, 
		“I will come to India in July or August. Leaving India permanently means 
		death to me. After coming, I will see whether I will be allowed to enter 
		Kolkata or not.” The reason for her return was very significant: her 
		Indian visa was valid only until August 12th, and before she left, the 
		Indian government had been loath to renew or extend it under pressure 
		from its allies, some of the most fundamentalist Muslim organisations in 
		India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr Nasrin had, in fact, applied 
		for Indian citizenship before she was deported to Sweden. This had been 
		denied to her and the Communists and the Muslim organisations had been 
		unambiguous in their demand that she be expelled from the country. The 
		Communists had banned some of her writing in the state of West Bengal 
		some years earlier and Muslim organisations had attacked Dr Nasrin in 
		full view of the television cameras and the media at a public function 
		in the state of Andhra Pradesh ruled by the Congresss Party in what was 
		clearly an attempt at killing her. How had the Indian government reacted 
		at the time? It had allowed the government of Andhra Pradesh to file 
		several cases, not against those who tried to brutalise Dr Nasrin, (this 
		including legislators of a party that is a Congress ally much as the 
		Communists were Congress allies at the time) but against Dr Nasrin 
		herself on completely trumped up charges. There were clear reasons for 
		this at the time. The Communists had been responsible for grabbing land 
		owned by India's minority Muslim community at Nandigram and Singur in 
		West Bengal, and for the subsequent brutal intimidation of those who had 
		been dispossessed from land ownership by members of their party and by 
		the West Bengal police, in a public display of thuggish behaviour. The 
		Communists conveniently made peace with the Islamists in India by 
		bartering Dr Nasrin's expulsion from the country (something that the 
		Islamists had been demanding for some time) for their silence on the 
		killing of Muslims and the thievery of their land. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since then, the Communists had 
		very nearly brought down the Indian Central government over the 
		government's signing of a key nuclear treaty with the USA to the 
		displeasure of the Chinese and of Indian leftists. In West Bengal 
		itself, in local elections, the Communists had done rather badly for the 
		first time in decades during which they had established a vice-like grip 
		over the state. After being cautious allies for the better part of four 
		years, the Congress and the Communists had suddenly become enemies in 
		the run up to a General Election in 2009 which is likely to be 
		hard-fought and which could go any way in India's fractured political 
		scenario. The Congress had fallen back on an old ploy of playing one 
		group against another by offering land to Hindus to worship at a temple 
		in the predominantly Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir hoping to get 
		crucial Hindu votes because they were unsure of Muslim support in the 
		coming elections. This is a ploy that ahs been used by the Congress in 
		the past. The late Rajiv Gandhi's government reopened the Babri Masjid 
		during the closing years of his term as Prime Minister to allow Hindu 
		groups to place a Shivalinga there and allow worship when Muslim groups 
		became furious with the government over the Indian Supreme Court's 
		insistence that divorced Muslim women had a right to receive alimony 
		from their ex-husbands in the Shah Bano's case. Not only did the 
		Congress pass the so-called “Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on 
		Divorce) Act of 1986 which effectively nullified the Supreme Court's 
		judgement at the time, the party also tried to curry favour with 
		Islamists by banning Salman Rushdie's book, “The Satanic Verses” well 
		before any Muslim country banned it and Iran issued a fatwa on his head. 
		This time, it has found another formerly Muslim author to play these 
		games with in Dr Nasrin. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The deviousness of the Congress 
		stand has been most interesting. Pranab Mukherjee, the Minister for 
		External Affairs and the seniormost Bengali politician in the Central 
		government, has been talking out of both sides of his mouth in the past 
		few days over Dr Nasrin's return. He ahs been reported in the 
		Bangladeshi media as saying that he hoped that Dr Nasrin would “not 
		cause any trouble.” In words that have been reported in the Bangladeshi 
		media, he is supposed to have said, “It is not possible for the Foreign 
		Minister of a country to keep track of the country's guests. It is for 
		them [the guests] to decide. We expect our guest not to do anything 
		which (sic) is causing a problem to any of our citizen (sic) and there 
		will no problem (sic) due to his or her stay in the country.” To India's 
		liberals and to the rest of the world, Mr Mukherjee spoke out of the 
		opposite side of his mouth with vaarious statements attributed to him by 
		different sections of the media. India's Communist run newspaper “The 
		Hindu” quoted him as saying, “Everyone is welcome to stay in the country 
		provided they remain within their limits.” To the Asian Age, a newspaper 
		formerly run by a Congress Party pamphleteer and Rajiv Gandhi sycophant 
		M J Akbar, he said, “It is our tradition that we give shelter to anyone 
		who seeks it but we also expect our guest to refrain from doing or 
		saying something which may create problems for our countrymen.” To the 
		Tribune, a powerful newspaper in Western India, he is supposed to have 
		commented that Dr Nasrin could live anywhere in India, but this was 
		contradicted when the minister told the Asian Age that it was upto West 
		Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee (one of those directly 
		responsible for the thuggish hounding of Dr Nasrin) whether, indeed, she 
		could return to Kolkata. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is clear that the Congress 
		Party and the Indian government that it heads, are playing a cynical 
		game using Dr Nasrin as a political football of sorts. Despite Mr 
		Mukherjee's pompous assertions that Dr Nasrin could live anywhere she 
		chose, she has been whisked away by Indian intelligence officials and 
		held at some undisclosed location in virtual captivity. India cannot 
		afford to look like the thuggish state that it is with the ratification 
		of the nuclear agreement pending in the US Congress, where the majority 
		Democratic Party is ambivalent about it. Democratic Party mouthpieces 
		like The New York Times have slammed the agreement and openly campaigned 
		for the USA to drop it. Any mention of the treatment meted out to a 
		woman writer in the US media would evoke loud cries and possibly 
		encourage anti treaty sentiment in a party and a media that is opposed 
		to any form of fascist and misogynistic behaviour anywhere in the world. 
		It is in this background that the two-faced attitude of the Indian 
		government and its flip-flops over Dr Nasrin have to be judged.</font></p>
