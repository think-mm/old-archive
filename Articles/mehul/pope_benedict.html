	<div class="doc-layout-body">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Cardinal Joseph 
		Ratzinger was sworn in as Pope Benedict XVI, a slew of articles in the 
		European media talked about his past as a member of the Hitler Youth. 
		The Vatican was quick to step in and tell the world that membership in 
		the Hitler Youth was mandatory in the Nazi era and that, as a boy, the 
		pope didn't have a choice. It was a lie. And, perhaps, this early 
		conditioning shaped the pope's thinking leading to his recent, regular 
		remarks against Muslims as a people, and Islam as a religion. Known long 
		before he was elected by the College of Cardinals as an arch 
		conservative, the pope has indeed lived up to his reputation with his 
		fanatical views.<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days after his election, the pope angered the Government of 
		India talking about restrictions on conversions to Catholicism. There 
		aren't any, and the one state that had banned conversions to any 
		religion, Tamilnadu, saw it's then government routed in elections. And 
		then came the pope's subsequent remarks against Muslims, beginning with 
		his comments on the Crusades. While his predecessor, John Paul II had 
		sent a delegation of Catholic monks on foot to Jerusalem in 2000 and 
		apologized to the Muslim world about the Crusades, Pope Benedict talked 
		about the Crusades having been moral and divinely inspired. One could 
		say that the capture of Jerusalem, which was gleefully described by the 
		Crusaders as a city that they left with an inch of blood across it, 
		could only be seen as &quot;moral&quot; and &quot;divinely inspired&quot; by someone with a 
		terribly perverted way of thinking. And yet, the world kept quiet at the 
		time, unwilling to voice anger at the remarks of the leader of the 
		largest faith.<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it was this silence from the world that encouraged the 
		Pope's recent remarks ostensibly quoting a 14th century Byzantine 
		Emperor, Manuel II Paleologos, “Show me just what Muhammad brought that 
		was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as 
		his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached,” or whether he 
		chose to test the limits of what the world would accept in his 
		denunciations of another religion is something that only he is aware. As 
		one who watches the Vatican and it's moves, this writer can only say 
		that this was expected. Hypocritically, for someone who endorsed the 
		bloody wars that saw hundreds of thousands killed, the pope continued 
		with his speech, telling his flock, “Violence is incompatible with the 
		nature of god and the nature of the soul.” This anti Muslim sentiment is 
		not new. In an interview to the French newspaper, Le Figaro, some years 
		ago, when asked about the proposal to accept Tkey as a member of the EU, 
		he had remarked, &quot;Turkey always represented another continent during 
		history, always in contrast with Europe.&quot;<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Benedict was elected to his position because his peers felt that he 
		had the authority to galvanize the Catholic faith, dying as it was in 
		Europe and most of the world with the exception of the Americas. It was 
		believed that his aggressively anti secular attitude would help recover 
		those who had left the Catholic faith either to join Evangelical 
		churches, or, to be atheists or agnostics. There were also reformist 
		Catholics who had problems with his defense of pedophile priests in his 
		arguments that they should not be subject to prosecution and punishment. 
		All of this shows the world, very clearly, that it deals with an 
		arrogant, almost racist man with scorn for anything that does not come 
		under the religion whose head he is.<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, there is a way to deal with him. Though the Vatican is an 
		independent nation in name, it's location in Italy gives those who 
		disagree with the Pope's remarks an avenue to silence him. Some years 
		ago, when Disney Corporation put up a display that angered Muslims 
		worldwide, the late Sheikh Sultan bin Ziyad Al Nahyan publicly warned 
		Disney Corporation that it could be expelled from the UAE if it did not 
		mend it's ways. Italy sells a vast quantity of luxury goods across the 
		Middle East and in wealthy Far Eastern countries like Malaysia, and 
		Indonesia. From Ermenegildo Zegna clothing to Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Ferrari 
		and Maserati cars, dozens of brands of perfumes, food products like 
		pasta, olive oil etc Italian companies sell billions of dollars worth of 
		goods to Muslim countries. A boycott of these goods by Muslims would 
		effectively force the pope to shut up. He may not apologise for the 
		current comments that he has made as many Muslims, including moderates 
		are demanding, but it is certain that he would not openly advocate anti 
		Muslim ideas even though he is certain to harbour them in his mind.<br>
		<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not getting the Pope to stop would be a danger not just to Muslims 
		but to the world's secularists as well. Remarks of this kind by the head 
		of the biggest Christian denomination could only swell the ranks of 
		fundamentalists among Muslims. 900 years after the Crusades took place, 
		they have the effect&nbsp; of angering Muslims across the world. Indian 
		Muslims whose ancestors had nothing to do with those bloody wars, 
		consider Salahuddin Ayubi a hero. In Syria and Egypt, Sultan Baybars, 
		who completely routed the Crusaders and finally wiped their presence out 
		is spoken about as if he were alive today. The Pope's views would, 
		therefore, only fuel the horrors of jihad, something that he ostensibly 
		seeks to oppose. A recent US government release said quite clearly that 
		80% of the victims of Jihadi violence across the world were Muslims. If 
		Benedict XVI really believes that jihad is a bad thing, he should shut 
		up. If he does not, then it is necessary for the world to force him not 
		to pontificate on matters that he has no knowledge of, and where his 
		prejudices continuously harm people across the world. A peaceful 
		economic boycott of Italian goods would achieve this quite swiftly.<br>
