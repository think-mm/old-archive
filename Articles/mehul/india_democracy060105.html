		<font size="2"></font>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a storm brewing in 
			India over the news about the tapping of opposition politicians’ 
			phones. First, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh’s phone was proven 
			to be tapped and now Tamilnadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha Jayaram 
			has alleged that her phone has been tapped as well. In a country 
			that touts itself as the world’s largest democracy, there is 
			evidence that this is little more than sales talk by Indian 
			politicians, of a fraud on more than a billion Indians by their own 
			government. It is not clear, at the moment, whether this storm would 
			die down or lead to a long term change in how the government works 
			in India. It would be wise to be skeptical about what is happening 
			and about any possible future re-examination of the current 
			Big-Brotherly state of affairs in the Indian government and it’s 
			supporters in the Indian media.</font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some years ago, Indian 
			newspapers conclusively proved that every letter that came into 
			India from outside the country was opened and read by Indian 
			intelligence. There was no public outcry in India at the time and 
			nothing really happened about the policy which probably continues to 
			this day. The newspapers that talked about it obviously found more 
			sales-worthy stories and moved on. Earlier, the Indian Express had 
			found its phone and fax lines disconnected during the early days of 
			the Bofors expose. And yet, the same Indian Express, some years 
			later, when it was firmly a BJP mouthpiece, attacked author 
			Arundhati Roy when she challenged India’s nuclear policy and wrote 
			to say that the government was welcome to investigate her income and 
			whatever else it wanted to look at, the reference being to the 
			Indian government’s vindictive ways. The Express found it convenient 
			to forget its own loud protestations of just a few years earlier as 
			it worked as a propaganda mouthpiece for the BJP led government at 
			the time.</font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And the Express is not the 
			only hypocritical Indian newspaper. “The Hindu” which supported the 
			Emergency throughout and then quietly apologized for this in a short 
			paragraph after Indira Gandhi’s defeat at the hands of the Janata 
			Party, screamed loudly when the Jayalalitha government sent 
			policemen into its offices to arrest a reporter whom the government 
			had decided had been too highly critical to be permitted to remain 
			free. Martin Niemoller’s immortal saying about the Holocaust</font></p>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font><i><b><font size="3" face="Verdana">&quot;First 
			they came for the Communists but I was not a Communist so I did not 
			speak out;<br>
			<br>
			Then they came for the Socialists and the Trade Unionists but I was 
			not one of them, so I did not speak out;<br>
			<br>
			Then they came for the Jews but I was not Jewish so I did not speak 
			out.<br>
			<br>
			And when they came for me, there was no one left to speak out for 
			me.&quot; </font></div>
		</b></i><font face="Arial" size="3">
		<div align="justify">
&nbsp;</div>
		</font>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">was not something that 
			either newspaper really cared to remember. </font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Considering the hypocrisy 
			that is part and parcel of India’s government and its press, it is 
			possible that nothing will happen in the long term on either the 
			wire tapping incidents or on the spying on Indian citizens’ personal 
			mail. Railway Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav whose home state Bihar 
			recently relegated his party to the dustbin actually taunted Amar 
			Singh asking the government to make the records of his phone taps 
			public. Forget a Big Brotherly attitude - this was typical of the 
			thuggishness that the Indian government regularly practices not just 
			against common citizens but also against politicians in the 
			opposition. The much touted “largest democracy” in the world seems 
			to look, more and more often like a farce.</font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India is a country where 
			laws dictate everything from the amount of “permissible” rat 
			droppings in food sold to the public through the government owned 
			“fair price shops” to how many people may gather together in a 
			public place at a time. Police patrols in states like Tamilnadu are 
			known to harass motorcyclists and scooter riders after 10:00 at 
			night though no car is ever stopped - some are definitely more equal 
			than others in this democracy by Orwell. And, while there are laws 
			and conventions restricting the rights of the individual Indian 
			coming into force almost everyday, there has not been any major 
			attempt at curbing the powers of governments or of individual 
			government servants even when they go drastically against all norms 
			of decency or even break the law. Indians get kicked around by 
			almost all government departments that they need to deal with from 
			the motor vehicle licensing authorities through the customs, the 
			passport office and the ration and voter ID distribution centres to 
			the tax authorities. Life for the common Indian is a never ending 
			series of headaches whenever he/she has to deal with Indian 
			officialdom. And yet, you would be told, if you asked, that India is 
			a democracy. The loudest voices in shouting this would be those of 
			the oppressors in the Indian government, the voices of those who do 
			nothing to stop the assault on individuals freedoms in India. They 
			shout these paeans to Indian “democracy” while flouting every norm 
			of decency in the world’s democracies that they would like India to 
			be compared with. It would not be inconceivable, then, for W H 
			Auden’s “The Unknown Citizen” to become something that India’s 
			leaders chant at every public forum, believing that it is praise for 
			their system.</font></div>
