		<font size="2"></font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was many years ago when, in 
		school, I wondered why people threw corpses into the Ganga in the belief 
		that they went to heaven. As a schoolboy, I had learned that rivers 
		flowed out into the sea. We also knew that rivers provided valuable 
		drinking water and, living in a city like Madras that was perennially 
		starved of water supplies, it was incredible to see thousands of people 
		throwing corpses into the river and dirtying it up even as they claimed 
		that it was a sacred river. I talked to my friends about it in school 
		and they did not seem to want to talk about it. They were probably 
		scared to even think about something like this because it could involve 
		a reprimand or even a thrashing at home. <br>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And then there was the question 
		of rituals - a friend’s father, a scientist at a nuclear facility, 
		conducted a yagna at their new home. We were all invited and dutifully 
		went there though out interest was more in the grand lunch that would 
		follow. The temptation of sweets and good food was definitely a better 
		thing than a ritual that would leave several of us coughing from the 
		smoke that ensued and some others asleep from the Sanskrit mumbo jumbo 
		that was chanted. The friend whose father was conducting this ritual 
		told us that the flames would release “good things” into the air and 
		that was why they were conducting this ritual. I suspect, to this day, 
		that this was directed at me and a friend of mine who is a hugely 
		successful entrepreneur in South India these days. While I smiled at 
		this statement, my skeptic friend asked our host whether the carbon 
		dioxide and carbon monoxide that came out of the flame were the “good 
		things” that he was talking about.<br>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was funny, how religions that 
		claimed to work for the world and to improve everything in life were 
		singularly destructive of vital necessities for life like water and air. 
		And their destructiveness as far as the environment is concerned went 
		much further. Several festivals in South India involve the smashing of 
		pumpkins and other vegetables on the streets, leaving rotting, stinking 
		neighborhoods for days sometimes, sometimes even longer. Who knows what 
		diseases this spreads even while those who have obviously been blessed 
		by this kind of activity reap their rewards in disease and, when they 
		have borrowed money to perform these rituals, in poverty as well? <br>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most ridiculous festival of 
		all was India’s most celebrated one - Diwali. The sheer noise pollution 
		from millions of firecrackers being set off day after day, their eye and 
		nostril burning smoke that pollutes entire cities more than all the 
		automobiles and cigarettes in India put together and the filth from 
		banana trees chopped down and tied outside homes and left to rot has to 
		be seen to be believed. At the hospital where my father practiced and 
		where I briefly worked, there were always people with their fingers 
		blown off by these firecrackers and some blinded by them for life. And 
		yet, the madness would go on with a religious passion, year after year, 
		polluting and dirtying the city and injuring and maiming more and more 
		people.<br>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And, this was not confined to 
		Hinduism alone. Christians jumped on the pollution bandwagon in India - 
		they already had a tradition of using incense in their churches, incense 
		that is known to contain several carcinogens, and they too use 
		firecrackers aplenty in their festivals in India these days. While they 
		do not throw their half smouldering corpses into rivers, they bury them 
		in the ground, making large stretches of land in a perennially land 
		starved, crowded place like India completely unusable. And, as 
		Ahl-E-Qitab, they were enthusiastically joined by the Muslim community 
		in degrading the soil. I wondered whether they believed that they would 
		be privileged if they were buried in their sacred places - Jerusalem or 
		Mecca like the Hindus preferred being thrown half burned into the 
		Ganges? And I don’t even want to talk about India’s Zoroastrian minority 
		and their custom of inviting vultures to feed on their deceased before 
		throwing the bones into lime pits.<br>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is clear, through all of 
		this, though, that religion does play an important role in degrading the 
		environment through it’s rituals. It encourages waste - India is a 
		country where some 300 million people live below the poverty line, 
		surviving on one meal a day. In these circumstances, the waste of food - 
		pumpkins smashed on the streets, the throwing of corpses into rivers 
		when there is a shortage of water and the horrendous noise and air 
		pollution do suggest, at the very least, a need for pressing reform. But 
		then, one comes to Shaw’s dirty water and clean water analogy from his 
		“Black Girl in Search of God” where he suggests that dirty water and 
		clean water be kept separate, that adding clean water to dirty water in 
		any proportion would not make the dirty water safe to drink. Amen!</font></p>
