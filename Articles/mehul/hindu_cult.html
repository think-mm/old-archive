	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was a chance post by a member of 
	these forums that drew me to the presence of a much feared Hindu cult, the 
	Ananda Marg, in the USA. The post itself was a response to another member’s 
	expressed relief that the Ananda Marg had been rooted out of the USA in the 
	1960s, something that the responder wanted to correct. He announced with 
	barely concealed pride that his group had membership in 162 countries around 
	the world including the USA, and that several offshoots had been recognized 
	as NGOs and Non Governmental Voluntary Organisations by the United Nations. 
	These were impressive credentials indeed for a group, one of whose monks, 
	Acharya Tathbhananand Avadhoot, had been arrested barely a year earlier in a 
	sensational arms drop case which had shocked not just India, but indeed, the 
	whole world. Five others - Acharya Suranjananda Avadhoot alias Randy, 
	Acharya Saiteswarananda, Acharya Jagadiswarananda Avadhoot, B. Rameshan and 
	Daya M. Anand alias Deepak are wanted on Interpol no! tices and still elude 
	capture while nearly every country in the world looks nervously to check if 
	they live within it’s borders. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1995, the Ananda Marg arranged to 
	charter a Latvian aircraft and air dropped a huge quantity of arms and 
	ammunition at a long abandoned World War II airbase near it’s Inernational 
	headquarters. The sheer ineptitude of the Indian officialdom allowed the 
	arms to be dropped and while some were captured by the law enforcement 
	authorities, a vast quantity remain unaccounted for until today, probably 
	stored by the organization to use whenever it felt like using them. And, use 
	weapons and kill people, it had, in the past. From investigations into 
	allegations of the cult’s rituals of human sacrifice to bloody clashes 
	between rival camps of the Marg itself in addition to it’s long standing 
	state of conflict with the Marxist government in the state of West Bengal 
	where it is based, there is a wealth of evidence about it’s violent history. 
	And, like the Al Qaeda or any other violent group out to kill people, there 
	is no saying where the Marg could strike. The difference between Qaeda ! and 
	the Marg is that the Marg is recognized by the UN and flourishes almost 
	openly while Al Qaeda is in hiding. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And it is not just the Ananda Marg 
	that has a presence in the USA - The Kalki cult, a doomsday Hindu cult that 
	takes it’s name from the prophesied tenth avatar of Vishnu who is supposed 
	to destroy the world, has several chapters in the US, predominantly in the 
	Silicon Valley area though chapters exist across the USA in Indian 
	communities, especially among South Indians, a community that the founder, a 
	former insurance salesman called Vijayakumar Naidu himself belongs to. Naidu 
	proclaimed himself Kalki incarnate in the 1980s and built a huge ashram at 
	Nemam outside Chennai. While the Indian authorities seemed happily unaware 
	of the organization and it’s activities, it took a detailed investigation by 
	The Indian Express to expose the sordid activities of the cult itself. Among 
	other dastardly activities including the sexual abuse of several women 
	devotees, the real fear was what the organization would do to try and prove 
	it’s founder’s doomsday prophecies. At a time when Japan h! ad seen a 
	frightening attack by a similar Hindu cult, the Aum Shinrikyo, on the Tokyo 
	subway, there was a very real fear that this group would attempt something 
	similarly vicious to “prove” it’s prophecies. The Tamilnadu state government 
	cracked down on the cult systematically forcing Naidu to flee to the 
	neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh where he has stayed until today. There 
	were reports that the then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister, Chandrababu Naidu, 
	was either related to Vijayakumar Naidu or was a devotee on the sly, 
	something that had prevented his being arrested there. The cult now calls 
	itself the Golden Age Foundation and it seems to have established itself 
	quite well, conducting regular meetings and group prayers, though nothing 
	dangerous, obnoxious or sinister has taken place - yet. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And that leaves what is possibly the 
	most powerful Hindu cult in India today, a cult whose founder celebrates her 
	birthday giving blessings to India’s President, former Prime and Home 
	Minister and a long list of notables in addition to the country’s senior 
	most leaders - Mata Amritanandamayi. Known as the “hugging saint” for her 
	granting blessings to her devotees by hugging them, she has managed to pick 
	her spokespeople well. From the nominally Christian former Chief Minister of 
	the state of Kerala A K Antony to the nominally Muslim President of India, A 
	P J Abdul Kalam. Internationally, she has established ashrams in San Ramon, 
	Santa Fe and Ann Arbor and more than 80 worship groups across the USA, a 
	formidable presence that seems to grow by the day. The group also has a dark 
	past which has been documented by Srini Pattathanam, journalist and General 
	Secretary of Bharatiya Yuktivadi Sangham. His book Mata Amritanandamayi: 
	Sacred Stories and Realities has documented several h! ighly suspicious 
	murders in and around her mail ashram in Vallicavu in Kerala, India, in 
	addition to disproving several miracles that she claims to have performed. 
	Amritanandamayi’s immense political power in India manifested itself quite 
	openly when former Chief Minister of Kerala A K Antony, filed a slew of 
	specious lawsuits against the author, the publisher and the printer of this 
	book claiming that they were out to incite religious disharmony. This was 
	nothing other than an attempt to silence the doubters using judicial 
	intimidation. The International Humanist and Ethical Union worked hard to 
	organise a letter writing campaign which rescued the rationalists by the 
	skin of their teeth from Indian judicial purgatory. This was a formidable 
	achievement in a country where elections were postponed in the vicinity of 
	the Ashram so that the President could attend Amritanandamayi’s birthday 
	celebrations. President APJ Abdul Kalam did not even bother to reply to 
	e-mailed petitions ! requesting him not to attend these celebrations as, in 
	a democracy, nothing could be more “sacred” then the exercise of public 
	franchise. And, in a replay of the Ananda Marg’s UN affiliation, 
	Amritanandamayi has made it a point to be seen with UN Secretary General 
	Kofi Annan on more than one occasion. She has also been awarded the 
	Gandhi-King award for Non Violence at the UN Headquarters in Geneva in the 
	past and also been a keynote speaker at the Millenium World Peace Summit at 
	the UN General Assembly in New York in the year 2000. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While a vast majority of followers 
	and members of these cults are law abiding citizens who may have some 
	emotional association with these organizations and their ideologies, the 
	past offers a compelling need for governments to be cautious about them. 
	When countries like India whose constitution declares it a “sovereign, 
	secular…republic” have the highest officers in the land kowtowing to some of 
	them and when some others receive NGO status from the UN even while Interpol 
	hunts some of their leaders for dangerous crimes only goes to show the clear 
	lack of a commonsense approach to dealing with them. Their presence in the 
	West only gives them an opportunity to collect money to fund their 
	activities and endorsement by the UN a sense of legitimacy. It is not only 
	to prevent this money and power from doing harm but also in order to 
	safeguard it’s own people from possible future threats when one goes by 
	these cults’ record in the past.</font></p>
