	The Atheist Alliance International in association with Atheists United as 
	the host association in the alliance, held the
	<a href="http://www.atheistalliance.org/convention2005.html">11th annual 
	Stars of Freethought convention</a> from March 25th to 27th 2005 at the 
	Crowne Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. At a time when secular values are under 
	pressure everywhere in the world, the convention aimed at emphasizing the 
	ethical nature of atheism as an ideology, discussing unique problems 
	associated with society and governments in the world in the present and also 
	invited speakers who had come out of different religions to share their 
	personal experiences in doing this. The convention featured names like 
	Richard Dawkins and Michael Newdow who are known to almost everyone in the 
	atheist and freethinking community but it also introduced new names which 
	were no less interesting. From young artist Joel Pelletier through actress 
	Julia Sweeney and Air Force Academy lecturer Carlos Bertha to magicians like 
	Penn and Teller who have devoted their profession! al life to exposing 
	miracles and activists like Jon Nelson and his wife Laura who are school 
	teachers, Sameer Wahaj (a businessman who does a show about his leaving 
	Islam) and MM's host Alan Levin among people who came to offer their time 
	and opinions and to learn from others. Personally, I learned good news about 
	Mukto-Mona that should delight every member here, but that is to come in due 
	course. I cannot let the best news out of the bag at this stage, can I? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If there were any doubts about the 
	sheer courage that atheists have been known to display down history, it is 
	my personal opinion that the credit for dispelling these at the conference 
	went to two individuals. Dr Carlos Bertha, who, as a lecturer in the Air 
	Force Academy, talked about the theory of &quot;Just War&quot; and bravely said in 
	public that the present war in Iraq was an unjust one in his opinion and 
	Sameer Wahaj who revealed his real name to the members at the convention 
	when he talked about his journey out of Islam as a religion along with his 
	sister. As someone who has been under threat of personal injury despite his 
	taking a witty and non confrontational approach unlike his contemporaries 
	Ali Sina and Abu Ibn Warraq, Wahaj struck an instant chord with his audience 
	and left everyone who attended his session feeling that he should have been 
	allotted a lot more time than the schedule there allowed him. His talk was 
	broken into several parts: 1. &quot;Born again Human&quot; - what it took to break out 
	of &quot;the matrix&quot; and see the world as it really is 2. Contradictions in Islam 
	3. The inequality of women in Islam 4. The American Muslim today and 5. 
	Coming full circle - Why the term &quot;American Muslim&quot; is a paradox. It is to 
	be hoped that we would receive his participation on MM and he has agreed, in 
	principle, to do this. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a time when many view the 
	secularism debate as a debate that is also one between superstition and 
	science, it has been common for proponents of religion to drag the name of 
	Albert Einstein into their arguments as Einstein was fond of using the term 
	&quot;god&quot; in several letters and writings. Alan Levin presented a landmark talk 
	on &quot;Einstein's Religion&quot; at the convention to analyse what Einstein meant 
	when he talked about a god. The talk found favour with the large body of 
	scientists at the convention, not the least with the man described as the 
	world's most famous atheist, Richard Dawkins himself. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The keynote address by Richard 
	Dawkins dwelled on his latest project, a television serial on religion and a 
	book that he would be writing alongside the serial for ITN in the UK. Prof 
	Dawkins led a long discussion with members of the audience on various topics 
	that they would prefer to see covered in the serial and the book. The 
	discussion is to continue throughout the filming on e-mail and those who 
	prefer to send their suggestions may do so via his publishers or ITN 
	television. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Due to a paucity of time, there were 
	three or four sessions run simultaneously and that was the only unfortunate 
	aspect to the convention in my personal opinion. There was a lot to learn 
	and not being able to attend some sessions because of attending others only 
	meant that less was learned overall. But then, this is a problem with any 
	large gathering of this type and it only renewed my personal determination 
	to attend next year's convention wherever it is conducted. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And then on to the good news - Leo 
	Igwe, Co-ordinator of the Nigerian Humanist Movement was awarded the 
	Freidenker's Award for an outstanding contribution to world atheism. He is, 
	as readers know, a contributor to MM and the facts about the movement's 
	problems in Nigeria were brought out to the audience, not the least of which 
	was that the movement did not even have a computer. An impromptu collection 
	was raised to collect money to buy a computer and the computer and the award 
	would be sent to him very soon. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now comes the best news of all, 
	something that everyone here should be proud of. Alan Levin announced that 
	Mukto Mona is currently the website with the fourth highest rate of traffic 
	among all atheist websites in the world. This is superb news indeed and I 
	hope that we shall be able to slowly make our way to the top of the list in 
	a sense of friendly competition with out peers in this field. Please watch 
	out for articles which would be coming in from time to time.</font></p>
