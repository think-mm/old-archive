		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For a country whose 
			constitution has a preamble that states that one of the Fundamental 
			Duties of Indian citizens is to “to develop the scientific temper, 
			humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform” (Article 51 A (h) of 
			the Preamble) India’s government has deviated vastly from what the 
			nation’s founding fathers hoped the nation would develop into. A 
			recent article by a reporter in “The Hindu” spoke about how 
			scientists in ISRO (the Indian Space Research Organisation) 
			routinely sought prayers at a Hindu religious centre in Dharmasthala 
			whenever a satellite launch was planned. This ritual included 
			handing a small scale replica of the satellite in order to seek 
			blessings to ensure that the launch was successful. This was not 
			something new - in 1986, the Indian Navy had bought an old aircraft 
			carrier from the British Navy, the HMS Hermes which was later 
			renamed INS Viraat in India. In order to take delivery of it, the 
			navy had sent a team of pundits to Felixstowe to perform a yagna 
			prescribed by the Atharva Veda to make ships “invincible.” In just 
			ten years’ time, the mantra from the Atharva Veda seemed to wear out 
			because the navy retired the ship and bought another secondhand 
			aircraft carrier, this time, the Admiral Gorshkov from Russia.</font></p>
			<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The intense religiosity of 
			the Indian people, something that had been responsible for bloody 
			wars and schisms for more than 3500 years was something that worried 
			India’s founding fathers considerably. India’s Independence Day, for 
			example, falls a day after Pakistan’s because astrologers in India 
			insisted that Aug the 14<sup>th</sup> 1947 was an inauspicious day. 
			Jawaharlal Nehru, a man who did not care for their superstitions, 
			had to fight a pitched battle until a compromise was reached and 
			India became independent at midnight on Aug the 15<sup>th</sup>. It 
			is not just possible, but highly probable that the duty outlined 
			from the Preamble was in the hope that India would become a modern 
			nation and cut itself free from the mental shackles of superstition 
			and ignorance that had kept it weak and a walkover for any invader 
			from Cyrus the Great to the British in the country’s long history. 
			The country’s founding fathers were worried about India lapsing at 
			some point in the future into the kind of obscurantism that had 
			characterized the country in its past. Their fears were to prove 
			prophetic in just a few decades.</font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While there were many 
			regional leaders who were not just religious fanatics, but even 
			superstitious to the extent of appearing silly to the world, it was 
			not until Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister that India saw 
			superstition right at the top. While the Congress Party bandies 
			about a letter written by her to a party member in the early 1970s 
			where she says that she has no time for religious leaders, she 
			encouraged Dhirendra Brahmachari, her “yoga teacher” to become an 
			influence on her like a Rasputin on the last Tsar. Among subsequent 
			Prime Ministers, there were both secular and superstitious ones - 
			Narasimha Rao had a long relationship with godman and convicted 
			criminal Chandra Swami while Atal Behari Vajpayee has been “blessed” 
			on more than one occasion by Kerala godwoman Mata Amritanandamayi. 
			But none of these could hold a candle to Indira’s son, Rajiv Gandhi 
			who went to Bangaru Adigal, a Tamil guru who had been imprisoned 
			earlier for forging Indian currency notes for his blessings and to 
			Devaraha Baba whose way of blessing devotees was to sit on a tree 
			and kick them lightly in the head. The kick did not help Rajiv win 
			his second election - he was assassinated and Devaraha Baba died 
			very soon afterwards. Current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has so 
			far been very careful not to involve himself with superstitious 
			causes.</font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That said, it was under the 
			rule of the BJP led coalition that India saw superstition become a 
			part of day to day affairs of government. Murli Manohar Joshi, a 
			former Professor of Physics at Delhi University and Minister for 
			Human Resources and Science and Technology would introduce Astrology 
			as a subject of study at university level and threaten universities 
			that did not introduce the course with reduced funding. The BJP 
			tried to make the recitation of the “Ssarasvathi Vandana” compulsory 
			in schools and forced rural schools that had been given grants under 
			“Operation Blackboard” to upgrade school infrastructure to buy 
			harmoniums and tabla s to promote this prayer. A Muslim President 
			whom the BJP promoted, APJ Abdul Kalam, would prove no less 
			superstitious than his Hindu fundamentalist benefactors - he would 
			actively promote the postponement of elections in Ochera district in 
			Kerala in order to attend the 50<sup>th</sup> birthday celebrations 
			of Mata Amritanandamayi, the godwoman and spiritual advisor to Prime 
			Minister Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani and others.</font></div>
		<div>
			<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is clear that after a 
			brief attempt at fighting the superstition and obscurantism of 
			centuries past, India is sliding slowly into a pit of stupidity. 
			Pranksters have, in the recent past, been able to succeed in a very 
			big way in fooling millions of Indians first by spreading rumours 
			that idols of the elephant headed Hindu god Ganesa would drink milk 
			on a certain day and then talking about a “Monkey Man” based on the 
			myth of the Hindu god Hanuman. And the exploitation of poor and 
			gullible Indians continues unabated by religious frauds. At a time 
			when the average Indian ahd to wait eleven years to take delivery of 
			a Bajaj scooter during Indira Gandhi’s socialist years, someone gave 
			Dhirendra Brahmachari an aeroplane as a gift. More recently, in a 
			recent article in “The Indian Skeptic” B Premanand quotes an 
			Economist article that estimates the worth of Indian godman Sathya 
			Sai Baba as $ 2 billion. Other missions have discreet but equally 
			large assets gained from cheating gullible people. In a land of 
			mainly poor and starving people, this difference appears stunningly 
			sad considering that it is mostly the poor and uneducated who have 
			been fooled into parting with money from their meager incomes by 
			sundry charlatans. And, the Indian state is complicit in this thanks 
			to politicians flouting the directions laid down by the country’s 
			founding fathers. </font></div>
