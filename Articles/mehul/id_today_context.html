	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was an incident that was 
	completely unrelated to the current raging debate in the USA on Evolution 
	and “Intelligent Design” that made me wonder about how dangerous the 
	legislative threat to modify educational syllabi really was. A friend who 
	has a seven year old daughter studying at a very exclusive private school in 
	San Francisco, had a major problem with her teacher over the choice of a 
	poem for an annual elocution contest in the school. His first choice was 
	Felicia Hemans’ “Casabianca” but the teacher refused to let his daughter 
	recite this poem because she said that it was “too dark” because the 
	protagonist died, burning to death. He then suggested W B Yeats’ “The Stolen 
	Child” and once again, the teacher shot the choice down because the poem 
	spoke of fairies taking children away. No, this wasn’t some school or school 
	board policy because, from what I learned, other teachers in the school 
	(including one whose son was in the same class and apparently had the same 
	problems) sympathized with my friend and his daughter. This was a case of 
	political correctness taken very far, but, it pointed directly at the danger 
	of allowing noise and bluster to dictate what educational syllabi should 
	have been, according to those trying to legislate the teaching of a work of 
	fiction called Intelligent Design. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I had already heard from the 
	thirteen year old son of a friend at a school in Appleton that he had 
	decided not to study science when he grew up, because, he had been taught at 
	the non-conformist church that he went to every Sunday, that “science did 
	not have room for moral values.” I wondered how many more young boys and 
	girls were being taught this at this particular church. When I tried talking 
	about the church in question to several people from other “rival” churches, 
	all they had to say was that in this economically backward part of the USA, 
	the church in question had been able to raise more than $ 3 million in one 
	year. There was a sense of awe in the other churches about this achievement 
	by the anti-science church and I wondered how many more similar churches 
	existed in other parts of this country. How many of them got people who were 
	basically poor to contribute huge amounts from their incomes and then 
	pursued a policy that, in the long term, would ensure that their children 
	stayed poor and desperate. With no background in science, what were they 
	trying to get their followers’ children to become? Taxi drivers? Wal Mart 
	clerks? One thing that those who ran the church in question were certain of 
	creating out of these children was a source of revenue for as long as the 
	children stayed with the church. It did not matter that without science in 
	their educational curricula these children would be doomed to doing minor 
	jobs and that their own futures would impact on that of the country as well 
	in the long term. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Which brings me, a complete non 
	expert in matters scientific, to the question of “Intelligent Design” and 
	the present debate over this issue. It is sad that it took a legal procedure 
	- a Supreme Court decision - to ensure that the process of evolution, for 
	which ample scientific evidence exists, was indeed what happened and not the 
	Biblical process of creation which was even dated to around 6000 BC by the 
	Bishop of Usher before Darwin blew his religious research into the weeds. 
	The fact that careful research and indeed all the evidence and not just from 
	Darwin but from James Hutton’s geological research well before Darwin’s own 
	work had shown that the scriptural account of creation was clearly fiction 
	was disregarded in what became an acrimonious argument between a church that 
	was determined to hang on to it’s traditional fiction and a body of 
	scientists and secular thinkers who were determined to demonstrate what they 
	had learned and had evidence of. The historical similarity, if one takes the 
	Scopes Monkey Trial where a schoolteacher was tried in Tennessee for 
	teaching Darwin to his students and fined for this “misdemeanour” was 
	clearly to Galileo’s trial for asserting that the Geocentric theory of the 
	church was wrong and that the heliocentric theory that he had propounded was 
	what the evidence pointed to as being right. When confronted with evidence 
	that it was wrong in the past, it was customary of the church to try whoever 
	disputed it’s fiction in the courts. The same thing that happened to Galileo 
	happened to Scopes except for one difference - the days of the Inquisition 
	were long over, there was a powerful secular government in the USA and the 
	church was unable to hammer it’s way through using brute force. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This brings the debate on 
	Intelligent Design into question - where an attempt at muzzling those who 
	would question Biblical fiction about Creation through the courts failed, it 
	has become a battle to use the one body in a democratic system that is above 
	the Judicial System - the Legislature. As the Judiciary’s function is to 
	interpret the law it is completely possible for a legislature, which makes 
	laws, to enact a law where the idea of an almighty creator who created 
	everything that exists is meant to be taught instead of the process of 
	evolution which we now know is factual. It is completely possible to force 
	the teaching of religious fiction - indeed several fundamentalist countries 
	in the Middle East do not teach evolution at all - if laws are enacted to 
	silence those who would want to teach it. The educational system has been 
	put on a tight leash in all this noise and confusion to as good as ban 
	poetry that is considered classic in most of the rest of the world. When 
	teachers have to think hard before they allow their students to read Felicia 
	Hemans or W B Yeats, something is dreadfully wrong. If they were compelled 
	to teach religious fiction as science it would be considerably worse. Harm 
	has indeed been done to children by bowdlerizing their textbooks and 
	regulating what they should read. This politically correct censorship 
	combined with a forced study of the fiction of “Intelligent Design” would do 
	little more than render the schools here into proto Christian “madrassas” 
	and children would grow up into religious automatons, taught what they 
	should believe in, not how to think for themselves. It is this danger to the 
	future of a great country that has to be addressed - hopefully, with every 
	argument that the fundamentalists make about their views on the origin of 
	the universe and on life, the secularists would counter with logic and 
	common sense and beat them at their dangerous game. Failure to do this would 
	mean the beginning of a new darkage in North America, and the attendant 
	beginning of continuous misery for people who are caught in this ridiculous 
	religious fiction.</font></p>
