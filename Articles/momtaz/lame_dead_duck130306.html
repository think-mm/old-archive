				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ronald Reagan left 
				Washington in a style. He told in a final radio broadcast to the 
				nation that the American economy is booming, and then flew to 
				California with the highest popularity ratings of any president 
				since World War II. Recent White House port deal failure which 
				was also opposed by Republican supporters made Bush not a lame 
				but a dead duck. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and House 
				Speaker Dennis Hastert told Bush that they had the votes to not 
				only kill the deal, but overturn his threatened veto of any 
				legislation derailing the deal. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">President Bush has been 
				battered by one adversity after another. He just can’t seem to 
				find grip for his second-term agenda. The war on terror champion 
				was totally rejected by more than 80% Americans and most members 
				of the House of Representatives on his own created security 
				issues to hand over six American sea ports to Dubai Port 
				Authority. The big lie eventually catches up with his 
				administration. Bush knows this very well that Dubai wants the 
				port deal in order to make money. But since he has spent so much 
				time fulminating against shadowy and sinister forces over there 
				somewhere, he has spooked the American public and members of his 
				own party. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Social Security and 
				the new Medicare prescription drug program have been evaporated 
				from the Bush second term agenda. The bad news has been coming 
				in waves, from Iraqi regime change then to WMD, furors over 
				Hurricane Katrina, the people in New Orleans who are dying of 
				thirst, starvation and the need for medical care, warrantless 
				wiretapping, Dick Cheney’s hunting accident, withdrawal of 
				Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers, growing civil strife in 
				Iraq, Iran nuclear enrichment problem and now the Republican 
				revolt over the administration’s Dubai port decision and many 
				more. The Senate Budget Committee passed a budget resolution 
				that dropped Bush's proposals for tax relief, expanded health 
				savings accounts and Medicare cuts. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Recent budgets have not 
				included the full costs of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. These 
				are presented as add-ons in requests for supplemental 
				appropriations after the formal budget has been presented to 
				Congress. Larger deficits would demand debt growing faster than 
				GDP and rising interest burden on the federal budget. If this 
				coercion were met with more borrowing, the problem would worsen 
				with each passing year. It seems the current tax and spending 
				policies will increase the debt burden quickly over the coming 
				years. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Republicans are not 
				willing to give Bush the benefit of the doubt as they did 
				before. The real irrationality is that Congress does seem to 
				realize that Dubai Company’s management of America's ports is 
				just a taste of what is coming. Perhaps greater foreign 
				ownership of U.S. assets is an inevitable consequence of the 
				reckless tax-cutting, deficit fiscal policies that the White 
				House and Congress have followed. Their policy encourage the 
				United States to consume more than it produces, which have 
				diverged in imports so fast that the nation is nearing a 
				trillion-dollar annual trade deficit. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bush deep in the problem 
				with Iraq and Iran. The elections in the Palestine, Iran or Iraq 
				legitimized the rule of fanatics and confirming the ethnic and 
				religious dominance that exist within the Middle East. There is 
				the considerable influence of religious fundamentalism within 
				the region. American public, media and military professionals 
				privately admit that the present administration fails to 
				recognize the danger as Iraq plunges into an irreversible civil 
				war. In US news media seems to be rehearsing its audience for 
				failure in Iraq. The basic concept is to keep the people 
				distracted and arguing over whether there is civil war in Iraq, 
				perhaps nobody will notice that Americans are in the midst of a 
				Republican and Democratic war here in the mainland. Some 
				analysts believe that civil war and resulting chaos in Iraq will 
				make a good excuse for US to stay there, kill the insurgents and 
				poison the environment. The worst thing could be a stable 
				democratic Iraqi government would be asked US to leave 
				immediately. </font></p>
				<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Iran nuclear program is 
				an ardent issue of the world especially for neocons. Let’s we 
				see what US did for Pakistan. US tolerated Pakistan’s support 
				for Kashmiri militants, Taliban regime and the development of 
				nuclear bomb. Dr. Qadeer Khan and four others have accepted that 
				they were involved in leaking nuclear know-how to Iran, Libya 
				and North Korea. Then what’s wrong with Iran? It is not Pakistan 
				but Musharraf remained a trusted ally of the US. Fighting a 
				bodyless ‘war on terror’ entity with boots on the ground is 
				getting tiring. Look, army generals play a military game while 
				terrorist plays a media game. The absence of any foremost Arab 
				nation Iran becomes a regional Islamic power. When you proceed a 
				false premise whatever, you do will not make things right. 
				Washington has lost its credibility in handling properly this 
				type of case since the invasion of Iraq. A military intervention 
				against Iran would result immediate dissociation of the world 
				public opinion. The rising cost of oil will force China oppose 
				this option. However, without UN should add a severe military 
				and diplomatic crisis to the economic and financial crisis. US 
				is going to face another economical challenge from Iran which 
				has the overwhelming support of Europe and Muslim countries. At 
				the end of March 2006, Iran is opening an Oil Bourse priced in 
				Euros bringing the end of the Dollar monopoly on the world oil 
				market. Definitely it will shake-up the global currency market 
				as oil producing countries will be able to charge their 
				production in Euros too. Ultimately European countries will be 
				able to buy oil directly in their own currency. The American 
				invasion to Baghdad was a fine military maneuver; however, in 
				the long run it is a small act in much greater play. I don’t 
				know what will happen when China and Russia enter the game. 
				Perhaps it will start as conventional or escalate further is 
				anyone’s guess. The vitality and viability of democracy in the 
				Middle East has been quivered to its foundations by these 
				events. The peace and stability appears to some extent 
				profoundly naive right now. The success of Bush doctrine is 
				often suffocated by the presence of pragmatism. Huge percentage 
				of US soldiers, National Guards and resources are far away 
				working hard and giving lives in Iraq; moreover, what else left 
				for US mainland or any other catastrophe? </font></p>
