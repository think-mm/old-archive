	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I hate giving people a chance to say 
	&quot;I told you so.&quot; So imagine the chorus after reports of an AL 5-point 
	&quot;understanding&quot; (soon to be denied as &quot;misunderstanding&quot;) with Khelafat 
	Andolan gong emerged. In one swift move, the party had rolled over and 
	handed on a platter every major Islamist demand of the last five years. 
	Whether BNP or AL wins in the next election, the patient, cunning Islamists 
	are the big winners in symbolic and real terms. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A friend wrote &quot;Don't worry, our 
	politicians do beimani. They will do beimani with Khelafat Andolon as well.&quot; 
	But for those of us who have lost interest in the why, how, or where AL (or 
	BNP) does anything, the motive for these electoral &quot;chomoks&quot; is irrelevant. 
	What really matters is the manner in which every islamist party, demand, and 
	agenda is slowly but surely penetrating into every artery of the national 
	body politic and infrastructure. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For the last five years, the 
	BNP-Jamaat coalition's ferocious attacks on secularism, and aggressive push 
	for an Islamist agenda has had an unexpected side effect. As BNP's enemy, AL 
	has automatically received the mantle of defender-of-secularism, without 
	doing a single thing to protect it. During the last three year's attacks on 
	the Ahmadiya community, I spent a significant time with the Ahmadiya mosques 
	for my film Muslims or Heretics. I was struck by the quiet faith many 
	Ahmadiya supporters had that AL would never allow these things to happen. In 
	all the time that Ahmadiya property was burnt, books were seized, mosques 
	attacked, and imams killed, the AL never raised a voice, or joined a rally. 
	But because the BNP was actively tolerating Khatme Nabuwat, all of us 
	presumed that AL would not do the same! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But just read a few items in the MOU 
	with Khelafot Andolon. &quot;To not accept Prophet Mohammed as the last Prophet 
	is forbidden.&quot; &quot;Blasphemy will be a punishable offense.&quot; If these items 
	sound familiar, it is because these have been demand #1 and 2 on every 
	single flyer given out at Khatme Nabuwat rallies. Having spent time at many 
	KN rallies documenting their speeches, I am struck (but not surprised) by 
	the manner in which the AL has now reproduced in toto the entire text and 
	sentiments of anti-Ahmadiya forces. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the 2001 elections, 
	BNP-affiliated thugs went on a revenge spree in Hindu villages, attacking, 
	raping and looting, all to target presumed AL supporters. The tragedy for 
	Hindu Bengalis is that they are getting the bamboo from both ends. Beaten to 
	a pulp for voting AL, and abandoned by AL when they are in power. But AL 
	never has to do any work to prove their credentials. Whether minority or 
	majority, anyone who wants a secular state is afraid to vote BNP because of 
	its clear stance against secularism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Khaleda Zia once said, &quot;If Hasina 
	gets elected, there will be ulu dhoni in the mosques of Bangladesh.&quot; That is 
	all it took to get AL branded secular, even while the party took a half 
	dozen steps in the opposite direction. From lok-dekhano umra and mathae 
	kapor to Bismillah in election posters, the AL has been playing the Islam 
	card for a while--confident that the secular vote is always theirs. It was 
	Hasina's infamous meeting with Golam Azam that led Farhad Mazhar to write an 
	essay titled, &quot;Sheikh Hasina has insulted Jahanara Imam's memory by touching 
	her coffin&quot; (after meeting with Azam). But faced with the larger embrace of 
	Jamaat by BNP, we who are so desperate for even a minute sign of secularism 
	have forgiven AL those past sins. Yes, Hasina sat with Jamaat, but she did 
	not bring them into a cabinet. But at the rate things are going, can we 
	trust that will never happen? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I wonder what Suranjit Sengupta and 
	other minority members of AL are thinking right now. I wonder how they can 
	keep a straight face when Sheikh Hasina talks about &quot;secularism&quot; to Bangali 
	Christians on the same day that Jalil announces an MOU with Shaikhul Hadidh. 
	Like Marie Antoinette, AL thinks &quot;let them eat cake&quot;, cutting a Christmas 
	cake with our beleaguered Christian citizens. That is the dessert to choke 
	on, a monument to opportunism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury was 
	defeated in the OIC election, he blamed a global campaign alleging that he 
	was a 1971 war criminal. Chief focus of his ire was the AL. In a furious 
	press conference, he threatened to &quot;Islamicize&quot; Sengupta's nether regions. I 
	remember being horrified, but now I feel that it is better to face SaQa 
	Chowdhury-- at least he lays his cards on the table and you know exactly 
	where you are. The problem with the so-called defenders of secularism is 
	that they will smile to your face while running the knife very deep into 
	your poor, unprotected back. Surely we can do better than this? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some ask why AL gets so much hate 
	for allying with Islamists, but the same does not happen for BNP. It's 
	because BNP is being consistentthey have never said they are interested in 
	secularism. Since their founding years, BNP has been committed to a project 
	of Bangladeshi not Bengali, Allah Hafez not Khoda Hafez, India as permanent 
	enemy, and the gun not the carrot for CHT Paharis. If BNP sits with Jamaat, 
	it is consistent with that vision--they have always been the &quot;Islam bachao&quot; 
	vote (as if our religion is so weak it needs Bangalis to &quot;save&quot; it). It is 
	only the AL who has ever profited from the secularism vote (and by the way, 
	not just minorities, but also thinking Muslimsand we are legion¬¬--want 
	religion separate from state). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most young people are bored by the 
	15-year serialized soap opera of BNP vs. AL. A retired official says &quot;Shob 
	ghughu, shob chor&quot; and it's hard to argue with his nihilistic mindset. But 
	what does matter is the permanent damage being done to the secularism 
	project (which is never anti-religion, but simply asks for separation of 
	religion from politics). From Zia to Ershad to Khaleda to Hasina, the 
	players change but the Islamist project grows mightier as every party makes 
	concessions to religious politicswhether by an inch or a mile. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Things fall apart, the center cannot 
	hold. Ten years from now, there may be no Hasina, Khaleda, Tarique, Joy, 
	Jalil, Bhuiyan. There may be a whole new set of playerswho may be vibrant 
	new jacks, or the same liquid in a new bottle. But the one sure thing is 
	that the Islamists will be much stronger. Today they are kingmakers, 
	tomorrow they will be kings.</font></p><hr width="50%">
