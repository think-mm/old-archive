	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Communal politics, being highly 
	emotional, is heady and creates strong illusion of success. Those who 
	indulge in communal politics create emotional hysteria among their 
	followers. However, every observer of such politics knows that such hysteria 
	does not last long and disappears as quickly as it creates such hysteria. It 
	is like strong heady wine. We in India have had many experiences such 
	emotional politics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The best example is that of 
	partition hysteria. The Muslim League had no concrete programme of action. 
	It had one point programme: creation of Pakistan. The direct action day 
	resulted in massacre of thousands of people. Well, Pakistan did come into 
	existence at the cost of one million lives and it could never become a 
	democracy, let alone a stable democracy. And soon Muslim League disappeared 
	from the scene, a Party which created a country did not survive longer than 
	a decade. Even when it was revived later during Zia-ul-Haq’s time it could 
	not capture the imagination of the people. It remained almost a dead horse. 
	It was Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) which became very popular in late 
	sixties and early seventies. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pakistan was also a heady wine for a 
	section of Muslims in pre-independence India. But it did not bring any 
	concrete benefit to Muslim masses. Only the elite benifted. It is important 
	to note that though communal hysteria is created in the masses but it 
	benefits politically and economically only the elite of the community. The 
	masses are ultimately left high and dry. Masses are made to believe that the 
	movement is for them and they often sacrifice their lives under that 
	illusion. After the hysteria they realise that they were used as an 
	instrument. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I was investigating the 
	Ahmedabad riots of 1981, which deeply affected the dalits too, some dalit 
	leaders told me that now we have understood the game of the BJP and they use 
	us as instruments for their politics. Now we will refuse to become their 
	hatha (instrument) and kill Muslims. But communal politics is quite heady 
	and these poor dalits again became their instrument in 1992 and 2002. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The late eighties saw communal 
	politics at its height in India. The BJP which had adopted sober programme 
	in 1980 (of secularism and Gandhian socialism) lost 1984 elections very 
	badly and could get as less as two seats in Parliament. Then the BJP began 
	to play communal game with a vengeance and by 1990 created a hysteria among 
	the Hindu masses (especially the OBCs and Dalits) on the issue of Ram 
	temple. The slogan mandir wahin banaenge (we will construct Ram temple there 
	only i.e. at the site of Babri Masjid) successfully created mass hysteria 
	along the Hindus and a sense of great insecurity among Muslims. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The BJP began to touch new heights, 
	especially in the Hindi heartland in 1990 when L.K.Advani took out Rath 
	Yatra for arousing mass hysteria among the Hindus. Many secularists had then 
	pointed out that the Rath Yatra was undertaken to counter the promulgation 
	of the implementation of Mandal Commission as its implementation had created 
	great enthusiasm among the lower caste Hindus and they were going to lend 
	massive support to Mr. V.P. Singh, the then Prime Minister and the BJP 
	wanted to win over these low caste Hindus. The BJP had no economic or 
	welfare programme for them which V.P. Singh had so it played the mandir card 
	to create mass hysteria among them. You need an ‘other’ and particularly a 
	‘religious other’ against whom such a hysteria can be created. For Muslim 
	League it was the Hindu and for the BJP the Muslim. Muslims were transformed 
	into an enemy, which need to be attacked. Muslims were projected as 
	descendents of Babar who was an invader and so the slogan babar ki aulad jao 
	Pakistan aur Qabrastan (O! children of Babar go to Pakistan or to qabrastan). 
	Muslims could be easily targeted as there is long history behind that and so 
	it was easy to create a mass hysteria against them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. L.K. Advani became an instant 
	hero and wherever he went during his rath yatra he attracted large number of 
	people. And not only Advani but also other leaders like Sadhvi Rithambara 
	and Uma Bharti who became star attraction as they spewed poison against 
	Muslims and Rithambara did in even sexually suggestive language. Also, there 
	was back ground to it. The people of India were tired of long Congress role 
	and the Congress leaders became synonymous with corruption and Mr. Advani 
	and others projected the Congress as a “party with a difference”, a clean 
	party which could provide alternative to the Congress misrule. And Muslims 
	were projected as the “pampered minority and responsible for keeping the 
	Congress in power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus Muslims could be doubly 
	targeted in creating a mass hysteria. They were children of those who 
	demolished their temples, particularly the Ram temple at Ayodhya and those 
	who were responsible for keeping the corrupt Congress in power. The BJP thus 
	came to power though with the help of other ‘secular’ allies. And now mass 
	hysteria began to recede as it happened in the case of Muslim League in 
	Pakistan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now the BJP had to face hard 
	realities of ruling over the country. Neither it could do anything for 
	constructing the temple nor it could maintain its party with a difference” 
	which it had so assiduously projected. The mass hysteria was over and hard 
	realities were staring in its face. Also being in coalition it had to follow 
	the coalition dharma (coalition religion) and it could not afford to 
	antagonise its ‘secular’ partners. Thus it could neither satisfy its 
	extremist friends among Hindutvawadis, nor could it satisfy its secular 
	friends and supporters. It could not deliver on any front. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sometimes it had to boost up its 
	extremist image and some times its moderate one. The extremists became more 
	extremists creating un-resolvable dilemmas. The VHP wanted temple to be 
	constructed and BJP would not only loose its other allies but would also 
	defy constitutional provisions by defying law courts, if it at all tried to 
	construct the Ram Temple. Caught in this dilemma the BJP fast lost its image 
	even as a Hindutva party, let alone a party with clean image. The media 
	exposed several scandals of corruption. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The communal forces succeed in 
	raising such mass hysteria but soon get thoroughly discredited and no amount 
	of efforts can revive them. The people feel cheated by them and they loose 
	all support and even begun to disintegrate. The BJP is facing similar 
	dilemma today. Mr. Advani, who was the main architect of BJP’s image 
	building is being asked to quit his job as the President of that party. His 
	exit is really disgraceful for him. The RSS and VHP hotheads are extracting 
	their pound of flesh. Advani’s remarks about Jinnah’s secularism can hardly 
	be swallowed by extremists. They do not think; they only believe in some 
	dogmas and for them Jinnah is a villain in toto and cannot be thought of 
	otherwise. But that is not the only reason for Advani’s exit. But the Jinnah 
	controversy provided an excuse which the Sangh Parivar was looking for.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Narendra Modi’s fate is no 
	different either. He also used the technique of mass hysteria to win the 
	Gujarat assembly elections with two-third majority. The whole Sangh Parivar 
	celebrated his victory and Modi began to be projected as a role model for 
	entire Parivar. The young leaders of Sangh Parivar even said that we have 
	found a model for winning elections (i.e. massacre minorities, create 
	hysteria and win elections) and we will use this model to win elections in 
	other states. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But soon they were in for a shock. 
	Let alone others Narendra Modi began to loose his following among his own 
	Party members. The mass hysteria soon evaporated and Narendra Modi’s 
	dictatorial ways alienated his followers. The dissidents from his party are 
	now demanding his resignation or removal from the chief ministership of 
	Gujarat. His communal oratorical skills are of no help to him. So far he has 
	been protected by Shri L.K.Advani but now Mr. Advani himself is in serious 
	trouble. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus from great hero Modi is fast 
	sliding towards political oblivion. People like Advani or Narendra Modi have 
	nothing to be proud of nor will they ever be remembered for any positive 
	contribution towards greatness of India. If anything they will be remembered 
	for causing deaths of hundreds of innocent people through their provocative 
	speeches. Even Shri A.B. Vajpayee is not likely to go down in history as a 
	sober statesman though he aspires to be one. He failed to show courage of 
	conviction to take action against Narendra Modi when he was provoking 
	carnage against minorities. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The fate of Shiv Sena, another 
	communal outfit from Maharashtra is no different. It once proudly claimed to 
	be the only genuine Hindutvawadi party and Bal Thackeray even claimed 
	publicly that his boys struck first blow at Babri Masjid. Today Shiv Sena is 
	in deep trouble. It also came to power by trashing minorities and was 
	responsible for Mumbai riots of 1992-93 which had, like the Gujarat riots of 
	2002, had shaken the conscience of the whole nation. Bal Thackeray’s hold on 
	the Marathi people has been seriously weakened. His followers whom he took 
	great pride in, are deserting him. It is a sinking ship now. Its vote base 
	is being fast eroded. It may soon find itself on the margins of Maharashtra 
	politics. Its strong holds are crumbling. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus it will be seen that o 
	political party can survive on communal fare for long. Like a heady wine it 
	goes up fast but then declines even faster. Such parties do not have any 
	base or even ideals to claim people’s support. Hate politics has serious 
	limitations.</font></td>
