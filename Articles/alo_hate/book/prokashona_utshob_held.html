        </ol>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The ceremony began with 
        introductory remarks from the Publishers Mr. Meshbauddin Ahmed (Ankur) 
        and A. N. Rasheda (Shiksa Barta). Mr. Ahmed openly declared that his 
        publication enterprise is very much proud that it could publish such a 
        critical and illuminating book on evolution of our universe entitled 
        written by young writer Avijit Roy. He declared that book is an 
        excellent addition to scientific and literary treasure in Bengali. Mrs. 
        Rasheda also spoke high of the book written by Professor Islam. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Professor Kabir Choudhury, although 
        admitting his limitation in following the book written in a scientific 
        language to which he is not familiar, did not fail to grasp the message 
        Avijit wants carry to his general readers; Professor Choudhury pointed 
        out that the message of Avijit’s book is clear and loud - to fight 
        against superstition, blind belief obscurantism with reason and logic 
        derived from the development of science and its inherent significance. 
        The learned professor stressed that scientific findings and theories if 
        could be reached to common men through poplar and lucid books as Avijit 
        Roy tried, a scientifically oriented society is a must to emerge in 
        future Bangladesh. He referred to Chandrashekhar-Edington debate as an 
        interesting one – an example that has never developed into personal 
        level. Edington and Chandrashekhar remained mutually respectful to each 
        other although they differed on scientific manner. Drawing the instance 
        in the context of Bangladesh he deplored that even at university there 
        is no healthy debate- the school has died down. If any controversy 
        arises on any issue instead of making a public debate it becomes 
        instantly partisan with myopic eye decease. Kabir Choudhury remarked 
        that after giving a lucid description of evolution of the universe- its 
        origin, its future, he in a well-written appendix has given what are the 
        religious views about the creation of Universe very faithfully with out 
        making any remarks. He left the matter to the enlightened readers which 
        one should be accepted. Professor Choudhury praised the depth of his 
        knowledge in holy books like Quran, Bible and Vedas, being a 
        technologist and scientist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">A very illuminating review article 
        was read out as Professor Sengupta, country’s leading nuclear physicist, 
        could not be present for personal difficulty. He praised the lucid 
        language in which intricate scientific matters from Ptolemy’s geocentric 
        model to most recent theory “String Theory” in an attempt to understand 
        the complicated process of evolution of the Universe. Professor Sengupta 
        opined that appendices of the book has been a valuable addition not only 
        for general readers lacking in physical laws for specialists too. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Mr. Bashir Al Helal dealt with book 
        written by Professor Islam – Bigganer Darshan (pratham parba). The book 
        is based on JD Bernal’s ‘Science in History’ and ‘Social function of 
        science’. Mr. Al Helal opined that name of the book Bigganer Darshan 
        (Philosophy of Science) is somewhat misleading- a more appropriate title 
        would have been “Bigganer Itihash” (History of science).</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Professor Anisuzzaman also confined 
        his discussion within Professor Islam’s book. He gave a description of 
        the book stressing Bernal’s social aspects of science how that could 
        influence the society. And indeed the development and evolution of 
        science has considerably influenced the society in the past as well as 
        present. He opined unless the second volume is out it would be premature 
        to call the book whether it is a book on history of science or on 
        philosophy of science depending how the book is developed by the author.
        </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Professor Shahidul Islam praised 
        profusely the way Avijit presented his theme of the book and gradual 
        development of evolution of universe in the light of changing scientific 
        more particularly physical discoveries and invention of theories based 
        on facts and observation from Newton to M-string theory. In the process 
        he had dealt many critical scientific inventions and hypotheses- not a 
        very simple work. One has to absorb those intricate discoveries and 
        their significance and present those to the common Bengali readers in a 
        non-mathematical language. According to Prof. Islam in our present day 
        context of Bangladesh main problem confronted in BD society is 
        superstition and blind faiths which if encouraged would evidently give 
        birth fundamentalism and communalism. Only educating our mass by 
        spreading scientific ideas and views to them could fight this evil. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Mr. Mizanur Rahman read out a 
        written article in which he stressed that not the scientist but the 
        social leaders are to be held responsible for misuse of scientific 
        discoveries. He cited from history in this regard that scientists 
        associated with A-bomb project for use of first atomic weapons on 
        Japanese soil during World War II were not to be held responsible, but 
        the USA authority at that time must be held responsible. He brought the 
        issue-&nbsp; are scientists really free to choose their desired field of 
        research which might affect the future society. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Journalist Arun Dasgupta at length 
        dealt with the book of Alohate as an excellence and timely book, which 
        should be read by our young men. He opined that the book would, if read 
        seriously, play a role in making a true scientific society in BD. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">From readers behalf Mr. Sayed Abul 
        Kalam declared that all should read the book written by Avijit Roy as 
        the book aims to eradicate blind faiths and habit of taking many things 
        without questioning. Questing to every thing, as a free thinker does, 
        paves the way to become freethinker. To accept blindly whatever our holy 
        books say or propagate without question is the greatest hindrance to 
        freethinking and to progress.</p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">The President of the function, 
        professor Ajoy Roy wind up the discussion by thanking Mukto-mona and 
        Shiksa Andolan Manch for organizing such a nice function which lasted 
        for over three hours and the speakers at the function. </p>
        <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">He credited JD Bernal as 
        outstanding crystallographer and a social human being. He saw science as 
        a key to social changes. In his opinion History of scientific 
        development must be looked as an integral part of history of 
        civilization of mankind. The scientific laws are to be treated as laws 
        produced or discovered by men in the society as a need of the society. 
        In this sense Science and society are interdependent- the president 
        remarked. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The president remarked that science 
        is not just a tool of developing human being’s material uplift, but it 
        is a way of thinking, way of solving not only scientific problem but 
        equally applicable to society’s various demands, and way of 
        understanding the mysteries of Universe and its evolution. In this sense 
        science has developed into its own philosophy from which the old and 
        classical philosophy differ considerably.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2" face="Arial">
