  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><span style="color:black">But I have&nbsp;always found 
  Americans more conservative on all issues then the rest of the western 
  world.&nbsp;Unless you are in one of the northeastern states, or in big cities like 
  New York, Chicago or LA it is hard to find progressive minded liberal 
  people&nbsp;so easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen the difference in reaction between American 
  people and the people in Europe when Bush and Blaire decided to attack Iraq. 
  There was no surprise that most of the US map looked red (where the republican 
  won) during the election. If you take out few states like New York, 
  Pennsylvania, Illinois and California with the big cities and big urban 
  population, Kerry would not be able to get half of the votes he has got in 
  this election.&nbsp; US media is way more conservative than the Western media; I 
  have seen many liberal Americans depending on European media for more accurate 
  and detail news during any crisis moment. More than 80% Americans are 
  religious though this country has been the hub of&nbsp; scientific innovations for 
  decades. &nbsp;I was also surprised to learn&nbsp;that it was a bad thing to be marked 
  as a 'liberal' in America. </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><span style="color:black">It was very hard for me to 
  adjust to the southern conservative culture when I moved to Atlanta, Georgia 
  with my job from the liberal North.&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlanta city is predominantly democrat 
  because of a large population of African Americans living in the urban areas, 
  but the rest of the state is as conservative as it can get. I mentioned in one 
  of the previous write ups how &nbsp;my daughter’s school teacher got deeply 
  offended after I told her I was an atheist. She told me very clearly that she 
  felt uncomfortable about it and she would feel much better if I had&nbsp;some kind 
  of faith! One of the very few gay couples I knew moved to California last 
  month as they were not feeling safe here anymore.&nbsp; Northern Georgia</span><span style="color:
black"> is still very conservative and racist and white Americans do not welcome 
  any other races there. </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><span style="color:black">Surprisingly I have found 
  myself more liberal than most of the Americans on different social and 
  political issues. &nbsp;As I finished my undergrad degree and joined the American 
  workforce I again found out that most of the people are conservative, 
  religious and ignorant about the rest of the world.&nbsp;That is also the reason, I 
  think, &nbsp;why it was so easy&nbsp;for Bush to fool these people on Iraq issue, and 
  most of the American supported their president overwhelmingly when the 
  Europeans did not. If history is any guide, this is an expected scenario&nbsp;for a 
  super power nation. The American people are also getting a share of their 
  global corporate oppressive system; as a result they&nbsp;are becoming a part of 
  the aggressive oppression cycle and gradually loosing their progressiveness as 
  common people. They lean towards oppression and socially stagnant structures 
  protecting this system more easily than the rest of the world. This is why the 
  Americans supported their president overwhelmingly on Iraq War, and most of 
  them could not care less when it was revealed that their president misled them 
  and had no valid reason to attack this country and kill thousands of 
  civilians. </span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><span style="color:black">Bush has received&nbsp; support from 
  the people who are keen to preserve their moral values and traditions. To 
  them, tradition means&nbsp;opposing Women's right to choose, Gay rights, stem cell 
  and scientific research, fights against racism, promoting faith of their 
  choice. The so called&nbsp;anti- Islam activists are supporting Bush in his Islamic 
  terrorism efforts, but Bush is one of&nbsp;the most conservative President of 
  United&nbsp;States who&nbsp;is promoting the faith based Christian&nbsp;right wing 
  agenda.&nbsp;These is the government who think <i>Jamate Islami</i> is a democratic 
  power in countries like Bangladesh. If these people think they have <b>
  to&nbsp;embrace the fundamentalist Christian right wing &nbsp;agenda to fight Islamic 
  terrorism which is a dangerous proposition</b>; it is leading them to take a 
  reactionary stand against humanity.&nbsp; We really need to re-evaluate their so 
  called 'progressive stand' one more time. May be it is fair to say, They are 
  against Islamic terrorism only and We are against all kinds of terrorism and 
  oppression&nbsp;which is not confined to narrow&nbsp;vision of&nbsp;personal hate. We do not 
  need to support a crime to eliminate the other. &nbsp;I guess, the difference is 
  very clear at this point. I have talked about this issue in this following 
  article before. </span></font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt" align="justify">
  <font face="Verdana"><span style="color:black">Please do not get me wrong. I 
  have had the opportunity to meet quite a few liberals and progressive minded 
  people here in the United States as well. I was actually lucky enough to find 
  like minded liberal people to hang out with all the time. &nbsp;After the Iraq war 
  one of my liberal American friends told me this&nbsp;was not a war between Iraq and 
  USA only, the way it has been launched, this would not be confined to Islamic 
  Terrorism verses America. This war will be extended to a worldwide <b>war 
  between the liberals and the neo-conservatives</b>. I have thought about this 
  many times; the world is actually shifting towards fundamentalism and 
  conservatism everywhere starting from the USA to the Middle East to South East 
  Asia;&nbsp; And Bush's victory confirmed it one more time. </span></font></p>
