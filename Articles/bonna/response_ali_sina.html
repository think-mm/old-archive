				Do you understand where this logic leads us to? Do you

				rewrite the international and domestic law and constitutions 
				which may look something like …. <i>If I am in power, it is

				I believe (even if it comes from Jesus and GOD), what my

				war victims in barbaric way,.. The list can go on and on. 
				Actually these liberal Americans have more in stake than our 
				ex-Islamists who are failing to see the bigger picture. To 
				liberal Americans, it is a question of protecting their future, 
				their civil liberties, leaving behind a progressive society for 
				their kids, and how they will be portrayed in history. For the 
				so called progressive ex-Islamist it is a mere question of 
				eradication of Islam. I would suggest these <i>progressive

				the contradictions in your decision? On one hand, you are 
				supporting a very conservative Christian, Corporate Sponsor, 
				Texan cowboy; on the other hand, you are screaming your head off 
				saying- you are a freethinker, you are against religions and 
				religious discriminations, and you are fighting (at least in 
				your illusion) against religious fundamentalism. <b>May be your 
				slogan should change, it should say….. We are against Islam 
				only, we are fighting only Islamic fundamentalism and we are 
				against discriminations done by Islam alone, if any other 
				faith/regime/Govt./Super power commit the same crime, we will be 
				with them. Then it will make more sense.</b></span></p>

				<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Let me 
				remark on another side of the story before I finish this write 
				up. Have you ever given it a thought that may be- <b>if the USA 
				did not sponsor the Saudi Kingship whole-heartedly since they 
				discovered oil there (6% of US economy is controlled by Saudi 
				money), may be the racist and parochial <i>‘Wahabi</i> Movement’ 
				would not have spread in countries like Bangladesh, India, 
				Pakistan?</b> May be, today <i>Jamat e Islami,</i> their mullahs 
				could not become so strong in our soil? May be- even Osama Bin 
				Laden would not have been created if super Power imperialist 
				Russia did not invade Afghanistan, or super power like the US 
				did not fund Bin Laden? May be, Saddam would not be so powerful, 
				if the US did not arm him? May be the Palestinians would not 
				have to convert themselves to terrorists, if the US did not take 
				side and finance Israelis to kill Palestinians? May be, Iraq 
				would not have this influx of foreign made terrorists right now 
				if the US did not invade a country without a legitimate reason? 
				May be history is repeating itself here, US policy is again 
				giving birth to another set of Osama Bin Ladens in Iraqi Soil; 
				only difference is, before they wanted to create them for their 
				own benefit, this time their own creation is biting them really 
				hard. &nbsp;</span></p>
