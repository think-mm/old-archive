	Biplab, </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I 
	have no problem accepting that we have to ‘apply scientific methods or 
	scientific way of thinking in our lives’, but I have serious problems in 
	accepting that science is a ‘purnanga jibon dorshon’, or ‘complete 
	philosophy of life.’ It exactly sounds like Muhammad saying, ‘Quran gives 
	you the ‘purnanga jibon darshon of life.’’ You said you were trying to 
	promote it for political reasons, but doesn't it sound very lame? Doesn’t it 
	sound like the politicians back home who will use anything for political 
	reason?! You started this debate using the word ‘Scientism’ in the 
	beginning, and then you slowly and cleverly deviated from that as you 
	figured out that the term has been trashed many times in the last century. 
	Then the next day, you came up with the word ‘Bigganbaad’, which does not 
	mean anything else but ‘Scientism’, although you are claiming that you do 
	not mean what the word scientism really means! First, let’s see how some 
	academic literatures define this trashy term: </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	“The work of Mill, Peirce, and Popper is a resource for philosophers 
	presently exploring the social dimensions of scientific knowledge. However, 
	the current debates are framed in the context of developments in both 
	philosophy of science and in history and social studies of science following 
	the collapse of the logical empiricist consensus. The philosophers of the 
	Vienna Circle are conventionally associated with an uncritical form of 
	positivism and with the logical empiricism that replaced American pragmatism 
	in the 1940s and 1950s. They saw natural science, however, as a potent force 
	for progressive social change. (Cartwright, Cat, and Chang 1996; Giere and 
	Richardson, eds., 1996) With its grounding in observation and public forms 
	of verification, science for them constituted a superior alternative to what 
	they saw as metaphysical obscurantism, an obscurantism that led not only to 
	bad thinking but to bad politics. While one development of this point of 
	view leads to scientism, the view that any meaningful question can be 
	answered by the methods of science; another development leads to inquiry 
	into what social conditions promote the growth of scientific knowledge.”
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/">
	http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/</a>&nbsp; (you can 
	also read about the plausibility of Popper’s theory in Social Sciences in 
	this link).</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	<br>
	I can not find any scientific reason (:)) to use the direct translation of a 
	trashed word in the western world in order to promote science in our poor 
	countries. I expected that someone as ‘scientific minded’ or ‘bigganbaadi’ 
	as yourself would think twice before using something like this. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	Now let’s see where we differ: I think this is also what Jahed, Avijit and I 
	have been trying to say from the beginning. We are all for promoting 
	‘scientific mind building’ and a‘scientific way of thinking’ in every aspect 
	of life (though I believe that screaming your head off about ONLY 
	‘bigganbaad’ will never resolve the real problem. At the end of the day, a 
	very complex political, socio-economical, and religious environment of a 
	country decides how science will be used within a national boundary. The 
	best example of that is the USA, which is the center of scientific 
	innovations, but because of the socio-political reasons, the majority of 
	people would like to adapt non-scientific religious fundamentalism as a way 
	of life. Anyways, I guess that is not the topic of our discussion here), but 
	I can not agree that ‘bigganbaad’ can be the only complete philosophy of 
	life. Let’s see how far science can really reach, if it can really cover the 
	whole nine yards of our lives as ‘purnanga jibon darshon’. Science can draw 
	the line between science and non-science. It can identify, depending on its 
	advancements at that time, that something is irrational, such as subjective 
	decisions and statements (philosophical, ethical, humanitarian issues, 
	etc.)…but that is exactly where it has to stop. It can not be applied to 
	many domains of human life because many things are beyond the scrutiny of 
	science. Using a scientific method, you can say, ‘this is completely 
	irrational’, or ‘this is not scientific’, but science can not explain why 
	and how it is happening, why a human brain is letting that person take an 
	irrational decision, or promoting that thinking in a person. This means 
	there are many areas of life which are really out of science’s reach. </span>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	Let me give you an example: Supposedly my daughter steals something from a 
	store, and I stand by her and say that I support her act of stealing. How 
	will you define my act scientifically? All science can say is this is an 
	irrational act. I can give you millions of examples of subjective decisions, 
	personal choices, beauty, art, etc, where science has no access. I know the 
	line is getting thinner and thinner with many scientific advances but there 
	is still a broad grey area where science can not be applied at all. That's 
	why philosophers like, Bertrand Russell says ‘Philosophy, as I shall 
	understand the word, is something intermediate between theology and science. 
	Like theology, it consists of speculations on matters as to which definite 
	knowledge has, so far, been unascertainable; but like science, it appeals to 
	human reasons rather than the authority; whether that of tradition or that 
	of revelation. All definite knowledge - so I should contend – belongs to 
	science; all dogma as to what surpasses definite knowledge belongs to 
	theology. But between theology and science there is no man’s 
	land.…Philosophy.” </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	My point is, it is completely meaningless to use the word ‘bigganbaad’ as a 
	‘purnango dorshon of life’. You are just another new kid on the block who 
	will fail to promote ‘scientism’ one more time. While we should work towards 
	building scientific methods of thinking, we should also be very careful 
	about preaching science as an ‘ism’. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	Let me show you very briefly what your ‘baad’ or ‘ism’ has done to your 
	logic and common senses: You are so bogged down with your ‘ism’ that you are 
	discovering theories, left and right, based on wrong assumptions. You have 
	started to create a dogma here. You are forgetting to mention that those are 
	the hypotheses created by you or some other people which might not be 
	applicable to many people’s lives. It has gotten to a point that you are 
	actually standing against the human rights and women’s right movements of 
	this century. Let me show you some examples from your article ‘Bigganbad’:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	You were so eager to apply the biological definition of life to human 
	society that you have started to apply it wrongly everywhere. Only because 
	our genes act selfishly in micro level, you conclude that the meaning of our 
	lives is saving the genetic code. From this, you conclude that we live our 
	lives only to reproduce and raise the kids and family properly. What an 
	over-simplification of scientific facts and theories! You might have missed 
	that many of the renowned biologists of our time strongly oppose the idea of 
	using biological theories in our social lives! Lets see what Dawkins himself 
	(whom you are proudly quoting like many others without a complete knowledge 
	about their work!) is saying about this! Refer to this interview with Simon 
	Hattenstone and Dawkins: &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><u>
	<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Simon Hattenstone</span></u><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">: 
	“But, of course, Darwinism is also ferociously savage - the weeds die out, 
	the fittest survive, there is no moral universe because all is 
	pre-programmed and we have no free choice. Yes, [Dawkins] says, explaining 
	the title of the book (A Devil's Chaplin): ‘What Darwin said is 'what a book 
	a devil's chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low and 
	horridly cruel works of nature.’ Dawkins stresses that he doesn't see 
	himself as a devil's chaplain because he regards the world more 
	optimistically. Why? Your version sounds pretty revolting to me. I say, ‘Ah 
	no, [Dawkins] says, this is where life becomes even more fascinating, even 
	more awe-inspiring - <b>because humans, with their little acts of kindness, 
	are rebelling against their genes. So our humanity is a form of virus in the 
	genetic body?</b> </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	&quot;It's a nice way of putting it,&quot; Dawkins says.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/scienceandnatu,re/story/0,6000,892495,00.html">
	http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/scienceandnatu,re/story/0,6000,892495,00.html</a></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	Additionally, let’s see what Stephen Jay Gould had to say about using 
	biological theories against human societies in an interview. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
	<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Question: Finally, 
	given all the analogies and imposed models that you see -- what actual 
	lessons does natural evolution offer for society and organizations?<br>
	</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><br>
	<b>SJG:</b> “I think rather limited ones. And that's an important point. 
	There are meaningful analogies, we've been talking about some of them, but 
	the main error people make is to take a well-articulated and well-confirmed 
	mechanism of Darwinian change, that is, natural selection, and think it 
	ought to describe cultural change in humans as well. It really doesn't in 
	principle. Those are the errors of 19th-century social Darwinism.<br>
	The entire mechanics of change is so different in cultural versus natural 
	systems. In cultural systems change is Lamarckian -- acquired 
	characteristics can be inherited. Whatever we learn or invent in one 
	generation we teach directly to the next generation. That gives cultural 
	change a powerful driving force.”</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">
	<br>
	Now let’s see another example Biplab has drawn: Like a prophecy you declare 
	that if we follow your ‘bigganbaad’ the only and primary responsibility of 
	parents is to raise kids. And if someone is really ‘bigganbaadi’, then 
	divorce will not be expected after you have kids. Again, you forget to say 
	that this is one of your many male chauvinistic hypotheses, not a theory. <b>
	What a dilemma, in one hand you will cry for the women like ‘Moushumi’ ,who 
	are the victims of family violence, and on the other hand you will preach 
	like a right-wing fundamentalist catholic priest.</b> Again, here is the 
	problem of over simplification and making everything black and white through 
	your so called ‘bigganbaad’. You forget to see how divorce, in many cases, 
	becomes a critical issue for exercising women’s rights. Think about this for 
	a second: what if an abused Bengali girl (who has been tormented between her 
	own rights, society, her kids’ well being and was almost deciding to get a 
	divorce from the abusive relationship she is in) reads your version of 
	‘bigganbaad’ and decides to stay in an abusive relationship forever! What a 
	great contribution you are making for all the abused women in this world. 
	This is a very complex social issue, so we might not want to preach too much 
	of your mechanical version of ‘bigganbad’ here without understanding the 
	depth of the problem. Ironically, your own statistic goes completely against 
	your conclusion. It clearly shows how tension between the parents can create 
	depression among their kids. There is lots of literature which also proves 
	that kids from high tension families will be much better off if their 
	parents get divorced rather than them watching the tension all through their 
	lives!.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I 
	just showed few examples of the wrong theories you are proposing from the 
	over-simplification of science and the other factors of complex social 
	phenomenon. Your ‘Ism’ is bound to do that. There is no other choice, and 
	that is why it has been rejected by many scientists and sociologists for a 
	century. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">I 
	guess it is a free world and you can preach any theory you want, but I’ll 
	ask you to think about it one more time before you preach it again.&nbsp;</span></p>
