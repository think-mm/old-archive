mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">I see lots of truth in your statement and lots of
  emotions too. The world is taking a dangerous turn towards religious
  fundamentalism, and when I say that I also include Christians, Jews, Hindus
  and others and of course the Muslims. Yes, our country with many other Muslim
  countries is (or has) alarmingly shifting towards extreme fundamentalist
  Muslim ideology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is so
  encouraging to see that lot of us are getting worried about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">But</b> when you say 99% of
  Bangladeshi Muslims will rush to kill me, beat me up if I question Islam and
  Mohammed (you said… I am 100% sure that I am right. Few (1%) of them would
  not bother to argue with you, but the rest of them will insult you or beat or
  kill you, depends on the people and situation.) do you rally mean that? I am
  thinking, just to give you benefit of doubt, may be you are using it as a
  rhetoric to convey the alarmingly deteriorating situation in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Bangladesh,
  not really trying to mislead people by giving a wrong statistics.</span><span style="color:black"><o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">If I follow your path of logic</span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="color:black;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">,
  I can show you lot of examples from where I can derive to the solution that
  all Americans wanted to drop 500lbs bombs in Iraq or kill all Vietnamese, all
  Americans want to kill all gays or abortion supporters, all white Americans
  want to kill all African Americans, all Indians support the attacks on Muslims
  in Gujrat, all Israelis want to wipe out Palestinians or all Palestinians are
  fanatic suicide bombers. Once, I shared a little piece of <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>information with my daughter’s elementary school teacher in
  Georgia (yeap, I am talking about the scary conservative South) that I was an
  atheist…. she stopped talking to me since. Black Americans are still scared
  to go to a county, two exits from where I live, because of racial
  problems.These examples does not lead me to believe that all southerners are
  hateful racists. If we start to make conclusions like that, I think, lot of us
  will end up in a little corner of loneliness, hatred and denial. I know you
  will say these examples can not be compared to what is happening in the rest
  of the Muslim world, and you are right again. That is why we need to raise our
  voices against the rise of fundamentalist Islamization very strongly and at
  the same time should also keep in mind that we need to be very careful about
  the conclusion we draw, whom we alienate and what massage we send to millions
  of people. </span><span style="color:black"><o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">It is very important that we protest all extreme
  fundamentalist ideology and specially now, when Islam is in its full speed
  with all its fanatic actions and movements. They are engulfing power in most
  of the Muslim countries. This is a very courageous and inspiring mission you
  have volunteered to do. But can we really call all Muslims in the world
  fanatic, fundamentalist killers? My problem is then I have to include all
  known Bangladeshi muslims <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>like my
  parents who told me to read all the scriptures before I decide on a religion,
  who introduced me to authors like Debiproshad Chottopaddhay, Carl Sagan and
  others; my relatives who were arrested for actively participating in 1952
  Bhasha Andolon, my childhood private tutor who told me not to take Quran
  literally; so many poor and illiterate people who used to question Allah’s
  existence because of their pathetic lives in this world or the parents of my
  Muslim friends who gave shelters to lot of Hindu families during 1971 war and
  you know this list<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>can go on and
  on. I am sure all of these people do not fall under your 1% population only. I
  had a lifetime experience working in some remote villages, which included some
  Shaotal villages as well, and I have seen these people very closely. There are
  millions of completely illiterate people in Bangladesh who believe in a
  religion because everybody else does so or they were told by mollas to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We are forgetting that there are religious people who know
  very little about religion but believe in a faith (supreme deity) anyway,
  there are also educated secular muslims who take religion as a social ritual
  and convenience and only practices the parts which suit them. As we are going
  around and throwing them at the same camp with the extreme Muslim
  fundamentalists we are not only hurting their very sensitive belief system we
  are also telling them they belong to those people, not us. I don’t think at
  the end of the day this buys us anything other than strengthening our powerful
  enemy with more and more support. By including all general population of
  Bangladesh to the list of fanatic Muslims<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I think we are alienating lot of of good-hearted moderate people who
  could be our friends, but instead we are pushing them to the other side of the

  ‘Either you are with us or with them.’ </span><span style="color:black"><o:p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">I think what you (actually few of us) are mixing up is
  the difference between the common Muslims in Bangladesh (most of whom are not
  only illiterate but also deprived of any descent level of human rights and
  privileges)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and the
  institutionalized Muslim organizations like, jamat, or wahabis or madrasas,
  our corrupted politicians or big shots who are trying to take advantage of
  this religious ignorance and weaknesses our mass population possess. The later
  part is actively promoting and empowering extreme Islamization in countries
  like Bangladesh. There is a difference between practicing a religion
  personally and imposing it on people from the state and political level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>And yes, I will 100% agree with you that 99% of these institutionalized
  fundamentalist group of Muslims WILL try to kill you or beat you up or put you
  in exile if you try to question Islam in front of them. And their number is
  growing alarmingly every day. Don’t you think part of the blame comes on
  people like us too? We, on one hand, claim ourselves to be secular minded
  freethinkers, enlightened with education and free thoughts but on the other
  hand, forget to take the responsibility to influence the majority of common
  people who happen to have a belief system as they were born and brought up in
  a global human society where a useless idea of religion has taken over for
  thousands of years? </span><span style="color:black"><o:p>

  all over our little earth we are living in. We have seen similar phenomenon
  with Christianity during the middle ages. The problem is much bigger than we
  think, it is a global problem not confined to one country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If we really want to do something and really want to create a secular

  Bangladeshis including religious-minded believers, (doesn’t matter Hindu,
