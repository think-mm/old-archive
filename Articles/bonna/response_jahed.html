    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black"><font size="3">You raised a
    very good point that tons of people are paying tribute to Ronald Reagan
    including ex-British Prime minister Margaret Thacher. If how many people
    supported or paid tribute decide the nobility of a leader or action then,
    following the same logic, we should also justify Hitler’s actions as<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>noble deeds or invasion to Iraq as a blessing to humanity, as
    majority of the people of those invading countries supported the actions. It
    is ok to pay tributes but we should not try to justify all wrong doings of a
    person only because he died recently. It is very easy to be misled by the
    popular media, I would ask you to read or listen to other liberal medias (if
    possible international medias) before you make a judgment call on Reagan’s
    legacy. As Alain said there is nothing wrong in calling a spade a spade,
    there is no need to make a person look like a noble man only because he died
    couple of days ago.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black"><font size="3">Reagan
    redefined conservatism in United States politics. If you claim yourself a
    liberal then you might want to do some more research on his domestic and
    foreign policies on different issues. He drew on the ideas of a group called
    the “neoconservatives,” The conservative face of Republican party we are
    experiencing today was strengthened by Reagan’s strategy. He was against
    abortion rights and advocated for prayer in schools. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Reagan was responsible for attacking women's rights, as he
    tried to legitimate the backlash against feminism. He appointed the far
    right justice Antonin Scalia to the Supreme Court, and he loaded the lower
    court benches with anti-choice ideologues (Matthew Rothschild, published in
    Progressive). Please read through the list below and if you still think
    these were all actions with good intentions I will have no more to say…. I
    have tried to refrain myself from giving any opinion, just copied and pasted
    different postings and quotes from different newspapers with facts….<br>

    invaded Lebanon in 1982 to destroy guerilla bases, and the next year, Reagan
    sent U.S. forces as part of an international peace-keeping force, but when a
    suicide bomber crashed a bomb-filled truck into U.S. army barracks on
    October 23, 1983, killing over 200 marines, Reagan had to withdraw troops,

    <p><font size="3"><u><b>South Africa</b></u> (Published Wed, June 9,2004, by
    Boston Globe, by Derrick Z. Jackson)<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">PRESIDENT Bush proclaimed: &quot;Ronald Reagan believed
    that God takes the side of justice and that America has a special calling to
    oppose tyranny and defend freedom.&quot; In the first three days of news
    reports on the death of the former president, not a single major American
    newspaper, television station, or politician has dared to exhume this
    counterpoint to the Reagan's legacy: &quot;Immoral, evil, and totally
    un-Christian.&quot; <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">These were the words of Bishop Desmond Tutu, spoken on
    Capitol Hill at a House hearing in late 1984. It was just after Reagan's
    easy reelection. Tutu had just been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his
    nonviolent struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Throughout the United
    States a rising number of Americans were calling for American companies to
    stop doing business there. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Reagan ignored them. The president of so-called sunny
    optimism attempted to blind Americans with his policy of &quot;constructive
    engagement&quot; with the white minority regime in Pretoria. All
    constructive engagement did was give the white minority more time to mow
    down the black majority in the streets and keep dreamers of democracy, such
    as Nelson Mandela, behind bars. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In the weeks leading up to his appearance on Capitol Hill,
    Tutu said in speeches that it seemed that the Reagan White House saw
    &quot;blacks as expendable&quot; in South Africa. The white government
    forced black people from prized lands and into horrid townships. Migratory
    labor laws split families for 11 months at a time. Education was gutted for
    black children. There was virtually no due process for black defendants.
    Tutu said it was &quot;reminiscent of Hitler's Aryan madness.&quot; Tutu
    declared that &quot;constructive engagement is an abomination, an
    unmitigated disaster.&quot; Over the remainder of his presidency, at least
    3,000 people would die, mostly at the hands of the South African police and
    military. Another 20,000, including 6,000 children, according to one
    estimate by a human rights group, would be arrested under &quot;state of
    emergency&quot; decrees. Yet Reagan had the gall to say in 1985 that the
    &quot;reformist administration&quot; of South Africa had &quot;eliminated
    the segregation that we once had in our own country.&quot; In 1986, Reagan
    gave a speech where he said Mandela should be released but denounced
    sanctions with crocodile tears, claiming that they would hurt black workers,
    who were already ridiculously impoverished. Reagan's go-slow speech was
    denounced by Tutu, who said: &quot;I found it quite nauseating. I think the
    West, for my part, can go to hell. . . . Your president is the pits as far
    as blacks are concerned. He sits there like the great, big white chief of
    old.&quot; <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Later in 1986, Reagan made his greatest demonstration yet
    that black bodies were &quot;expendable.&quot; Congress had finally had
    enough of the carnage to vote for limited sanctions. Reagan vetoed them.
    Congress overrode the veto. Reagan proceeded to put no muscle behind the
    sanctions. Mandela remained in jail and at least 2,000 political prisoners
    remained detained without trial. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In 1987 Reagan published a report that said additional
    sanctions &quot;would not be helpful.&quot; The gleeful South African
    foreign minister, Roelof Botha, said that Reagan &quot;and his
    administration have an understanding of the reality of South
    Africa.&quot;&nbsp;<br>

    <p><font size="3">Reagan was responsible for killing tens of thousands of
    innocent people in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras as he
    waged illegal wars and funded brutal militaries. The truth commission of El
    Salvador investigated the murders of 75,000 people during the civil war in
    the 1980s, and it found that the Salvadoran military, or death squads
    connected to the military, had committed the bulk of those crimes. At the
    time, Bush was lavishing hundreds of millions of dollars on the Salvadoran
    government, and his CIA was working with the death squads. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Reagan was responsible, as Christopher Hitchens has noted,
    for approving Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which killed about 18,000
    civilians. <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Reagan was responsible for his own unilateral invasion of
    that huge threat to the United States called Grenada. (Oh, the great
    liberator!) <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="3">As Joanna Kirkpatrick has mentioned in response to
    Jahed’s post Reagan has supported all dictators not only because they
    supported US policy. She wrote, “During the Reaganocracy, he supported
    dictators around the world, including first of all Saddam, but also Marcos
    of the Philippines, Duvalier of Haiti,and worst of all Mobutu of Zaire.
    Because of Reagans knee-jerk cold warpolicies the US sent billions to Mobutu
    just because he kept on saying he<br>
    favored us against the USSR. Mobutu did nothing for his country—he
    impoverished it, acting like a god on earth, while he sent the billions to
    Swiss banks or spent them on his lavish life-style”<o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black"><font size="3">The president
    was so cut off from the counsel of black Americans that he sometimes did not
    even realize when he was offending them. One example occurred when Reagan
    sided with Bob Jones University in a lawsuit to obtain federal tax
    exemptions that had been denied by the IRS. The IRS denied tax exemptions to
    segregated private schools. Many of them were schools such as Bob Jones
    University, which enrolled a handful of minority students but prohibited
    interracial dating and marriage. It was the basis of this discrimination
    that the IRS denied the tax exemption. Reagan would later say that the case
    had never been presented to him as a civil rights issue. More astonishingly,
    he did not even know that many Christian schools practiced segregation<o:p>

    <p><font size="3">Reagan never supported the use of federal power to provide
    blacks with civil rights. He opposed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.
    Reagan said in 1980 that the Voting Rights Act had been “humiliating to
    the South.” While he made political points with white southerners on this
    issue, he was sensitive to any suggestion that his stands on civil rights
    issues were politically or racially motivated, and he typically reacted to
    such criticisms as attacks on his personal integrity<o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black"><font size="3">Reagan
    proposed constitutional amendment to allow prayers at school. He said in his
    speech in Orlando Florida, Mar, 8, 1983, “When our Founding Fathers passed
    the First Amendment, they never intended to construct a wall between
    government and religious belief. The Supreme Court opens its proceedings
    with a religious invocation. Congress opens sessions with a prayer. I
    believe the schoolchildren of the United States are entitled to the same
    privileges. I sent the Congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer
    to public schools. I am calling on the Congress to act speedily and to let
    our children pray.” <o:p>

    over two decades, the government budget had slowly and steadily risen, much
    to the disturbance of the tax-paying public, and by the 80s, the public was
    tired of the New Deal and the Great Society and ready to slash bills, just
    as Reagan proposed. Reagan’s budget cost $695 million, and the vast
    majority of budget cuts fell upon social programs, not on defense, but there
    were also sweeping tax cuts of 25% over three years. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black"><font size="3">During the
    1980s, income gaps widened between the rich and poor for the first time in
    the 20<sup>th</sup> century (this was mirrored by the emergence of
    “yuppies”), and it was massive military spending (a $100 billion annual
    deficit in 1982 and nearly $200 million annual deficits in the later years)
    that upped the American dollar (as well as the trade deficit, which reached
    a record $152 billion in 1987) and made America the world’s biggest
    borrowers. Supply-side economics claimed that cutting taxes would actually
    increase government revenue, but instead, during his eight years in office,
    Reagan accumulated a $2 trillion debt—more than all his presidential
    predecessors combined. (Collected from AP US history notes)<o:p>

    poorest fifth of the American population dropped by 6.1 percent, and rose
    11.1 percent for the top fifth, according to &quot;Sleepwalking Through
    History,&quot; the best-selling assessment of the Reagan years by Haynes
    Johnson. The number of people living beneath the federal poverty line rose
    from 24.5 million in 1978 to 32.5 million in 1988. And the number of
    homeless people went from something so little it wasn't even written about
    widely in the late 1970s to more than 2 million when Reagan left office.
