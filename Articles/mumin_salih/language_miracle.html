	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">THE QURAN is believed by Muslims to 
	be God's word to man, and is ˜revealed’ and written in Arabic. Muslims also 
	believe that the Quran, as we know it today, is the same as was revealed 
	1400 years ago. Almost all Muslims know some of its verses by heart, which 
	they recite during their five daily prayers. Some of them even know the 
	entire Quran by heart. At the time of ‘revelation’ of the Quran, the Arabs 
	had such a great linguistic mastery of Arabic that one may argue that such 
	talent was probably the only kind of art they perfected. Today, many will 
	still consider the pre-Islamic Arabic literature and poetry to be the best. 
	If the Quran is a truly a language-miracle, then we can say with certainty 
	that it is not ‘revealed’ to mankind in general, and not even to the Arabs 
	in particular. This is because all non-Arabic speaking nations cannot 
	read/understand the Quran; therefore, they are not in a position to 
	appreciate the claimed language-miracle. This is equally true to the 
	majority of today’s Arabs, simply because they themselves lack the necessary 
	command of classic Arabic in which the Quran was ‘revealed’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is interesting to note that 
	Muslims of all nationalities talks about how the Quran is a 
	language-miracle, while all what they can do is to recite some verses 
	without even understanding the meaning of these verses. On the other hand, 
	there are many Christian Arab writers whose knowledge in classic Arabic is 
	beyond doubt, but they do not feel that the Quran contains any miracles at 
	all! Speaking of myself, I always felt guilty when I read the Quran because 
	every time I read the Quran, get a strange feeling that this book can never 
	be divine, after all. This is not because of the many scientific errors it 
	contains (we can always twist the Arabic language to accommodate those, as 
	we often do) but because of the poor language style of the book. Considering 
	only the language style, I can say there are some verses or a few entire 
	suras in the Quran which are very nicely written, some are average and some 
	are poor. That was how I found the Quran to be. My only explanation for this 
	assessment of the Quran is that, while I previously always thought the Quran 
	to be infallible, perfect words of Allah, but after carefully comprehending 
	it, found no perfection in it. Even though I found in the Quran repetitious, 
	contradictory and grammatically incorrect, I blamed myself for this, instead 
	the Quran, for, I thought it must be I who is wrong, since Quran could never 
	contain any error in it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So who will judge if the Quran is a 
	language-miracle or not? Muslim scholars will automatically claim that it is 
	a miracle, while others will certainly disagree. The mere fact that we have 
	reached this opposing situation is in itself evidence that the Quran is not 
	a miracle. A miracle should be clear to every human being, regardless of his 
	or her languages, literacy or intelligence. Everyone—without any exception, 
	must agree on the claim of Quran’s perfection. Just for the argument’s sake 
	let us go back in history and see how the early Arabs thought of the Quran. 
	Mohammed spent 13 years preaching Islam in his hometown Mecca with very 
	limited success. During this period, only few dozens accepted his call, many 
	of them were Muhammad’s close friends and relatives. He used to go to the 
	famous Okaz market, just outside Mecca, to preach Islam, but failed to make 
	much impression on his listeners. Okaz fair was a very popular festival for 
	the Arabs. All poets gathered there to narrate their latest poems and 
	advertise their literary work. Mohammed was there competing with them to 
	recite not his latest poems but Allah’s latest revelations to him. The 
	Arabs, however, were more interested to listen to poetry!</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If those Arabs felt there was a 
	miracle in what Mohammed was saying, they would have certainly stayed and 
	listened to him intently, but they turned their backs and went away. Are we 
	to believe that Allah’s work was unable to win a competition with those 
	human poets? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims argue that the people of 
	Mecca were not convinced because they just did not want to be convinced, not 
	because the Quran is not convincing. Their evidence is that the Arabs of 
	Medina (the tribes of Aws and Khazraj ) were easily convinced and converted 
	to Islam even before Mohammed arrived at their city. But this is a clear 
	evidence that the two competing Arab tribes of Medina made their decision to 
	accept Mohammed and Islam for political reasons only and nothing else. Most 
	of those Arabs did not see Mohammed or had even heard of the Quran. They 
	converted to Islam simply because their leaders made a deal with Mohammed to 
	accept to Islam and support him as a neutral third party, to put an end to 
	their long-going confrontations with each other. Let us move back a few 
	centuries and observe how the Arabs thought of the Quran during the height 
	of the Islamic empire. I shall mention the two most famous poets in Arabic 
	history. The first was Al Mutanabi, who is widely claimed to be the best 
	Arabic poet ever. At some stage, he himself claimed to be a prophet, because 
	he thought he could make a book which would be similar to the Quran. He was 
	given this name because of this claim. When Al Mutanabi realized the danger 
	on his life, he repented and cancelled his plans for his book. The other 
	famous poet was Abu Alaa Al Maari, a Syrian blind poet who even denounced 
	religions altogether. Of course, none of these two poets thought that the 
	Quran contained any miracles. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There might be many factors that 
	made ordinary Muslims believe the claimed miracles in the Quran. Because the 
	Quran can be read only in Arabic, it was left to the Arabs to make the 
	judgment about the Quranic language and style. Those Arabs are usually 
	Muslim clerics whose starting point is to assume the miracle then bend every 
	rule and logic to fit their logic around it. In this way they have turned 
	the entire concept of logical-thinking upside down and from back to front. 
	Meaningless words, repetitions and contradictions have all became parts of a 
	divine miracle! What helped them to maintain this attitude over centuries is 
	that other language experts like the Christians or the freethinkers were too 
	polite to make any comments. However, their silence and non-conversion to 
	Islam speak volumes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another factor that helped to 
	maintain this false sense of miracle is that Muslims insist that the Quran 
	cannot be translated to other languages. Muslims insist that all available 
	translations are for the meaning of the Quran, and there is no alternative 
	to reading the Quran in Arabic. So, any person interested to study the Quran 
	has to master the Arabic language, which is not an easy language to learn. 
	Reflecting on this, I must say that the Quran actually looks nicer and far 
	more impressive when translated! Then comes the psychological conditioning 
	of all Muslims. It is a tradition that the first voice a newly born infant 
	hears is the Allahu Akbar, poured in his/her ears immediately after the 
	birth. From that moment onwards the brainwashing process continues day and 
	night to the rest of this baby’s life. He/she will hear the Quran recited 
	day and night in a special format (Tajweed) that leaves in the mind a deep 
	sense of fear, which the mind translates into a profound respect to the word 
	of Allah. This is made easier by the difficult language and ambiguity of 
	most of the verses. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is my personal view that 
	religions rely on confusion and psychological intimidation to make their 
	point. It is like how stage magicians impress their audience. They first set 
	the seen carefully with the necessary background music and decor, and of 
	course they love the darkness. They are usually dressed in dark colours, and 
	choose a dark background. As if this is not enough, they also turn the 
	lights off to perform their trick. Their illusions do not work if there is 
	light. Darkness is their friend and light is their enemy. In my view, this 
	is exactly how religions survive. Muslim clerics do not like the light. They 
	hate science and logic while they love myths. They hate clarity and love 
	confusion. The Quran is written in books called Mushaf. Muslims are taught 
	from their childhood that this book is different from all other books. Only 
	clean people should hold it, so a menstruating woman cannot touch it. A 
	non-Muslim should never come close to it. A clean Muslim can only hold the 
	book with the right hand and not the left, and they kiss it as a sign of 
	respect. These Mushafs are written in a special format different from any 
	other book in the Arabic language. There are specially designed dictation 
	mistakes in every single verse. That adds further to the difficulty in 
	reading the book. It is like a puzzle book with special codes that require 
	special skills to solve the puzzle. In every Mushaf there are few pages at 
	the back listing the codes used to write the book. The Quran has another 
	peculiarity among other Arabic books. It is taught to children back to 
	front! As it happens, the short Suras are located towards the end of the 
	book, while the longer ones are at the front. So, children start to learn 
	the book back to front, which adds even further to that sense in their inner 
	mind that there is something special about this book. Muslims are 
	pre-conditioned to believe, without question, anything and everything 
	contained in the Quran. They are also prepared to say anything, even to lie, 
	in order to protect the divine image of this book. Ask any Muslim, “ Do you 
	believe that the Quran is a language-miracle?” And the answer certainly will 
	be, “Yes”, regardless of their level of literacy. To most Muslims, reading 
	and understanding the Quran is a torture, but when you ask them what would 
	they prefer to read, a good novel or the Quran? they will all answer for the 
	Quran. Any time you ask them, “What do you prefer to listen--a piece of nice 
	music or the Quran?” They will answer, “Of course, the Quran”. They view 
	that Allah is watching them through two spies on their shoulders. So they do 
	not take the risk of speaking their minds. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Quran has been used extensively 
	in medicine through out the Islamic world. Will any Muslim admit that it is 
	a useless therapy? There was a medical research in an Arabic country 
	comparing the calming effect of the Quran compared to calming of soothing 
	music. But how many Muslims will admit that they find man-made music more 
	relaxing than the Quran? Does God need a language to communicate with 
	humans? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Languages are means of input of 
	information to the brain. The other means are our five senses. Languages 
	were developed and are mainly used to facilitate communication between 
	members of the same society who speak the same language. They are just means 
	of transferring the information to the brain. For this purpose they have to 
	rely on the other senses. Spoken languages rely on hearing, while a written 
	word will rely on vision or touch. Therefore, languages are less reliable 
	than vision or hearing or other perceptible senses. Inaccuracies of language 
	communication can start from the beginning with pronunciations or accent 
	difficulties, and then on the receiving end there may be hearing or 
	understanding difficulties. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this sense, languages do not seem 
	to be the most effective means for delivering information to the brain. Why 
	God should chose this primitive means to communicate with humans? Is not God 
	capable of using more direct means to deliver his message to human brains, 
	ready and fully explained? The Quran is claimed to be the final call from 
	Allah to mankind to come and join Islam. It is supposed to be an 
	international message for all people everywhere in this world, but most 
	people never responded to it. Today, we must admit that the majority of 
	people never read the Quran, and the vast majority of those who read it do 
	not understand it. So after 1400 years the message has not been delivered. 
	Language communication did not seem to have worked. However, and just to be 
	fair, one has to admit that there is one remarkable miracle about the Quran, 
	which is how it has escaped open and free criticism for over 1400 years.
