	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">The claims that the Quran contains scientific miracles 
	started to came to light only recently. For 1400 years Muslims never thought 
	of the Quran as a book of scientific information and certainly did not find 
	scientific miracles in it. Even as recently as half a century ago Muslim 
	scientists read the Quran just like other Muslims did, without ever 
	considering subjecting it to scientific analysis. Had really they wanted, 
	they could have easily found at least a few scientific errors in the Quran, 
	but they mostly preferred to remain coy about this.&nbsp; Even when such errors 
	were manifest, they probably explained it with the alibi that the Quran was
	<i>revealed</i> to 7<sup>th</sup> century Arabs and was not really meant to 
	be a scientific book, anyway.</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">We must remember that the divine miracles passed to us 
	through religions were <b><i>never meant to prove the existence or 
	capabilities of God</i></b>. They were meant to prove the authenticity of a 
	particular prophet. In this case the Quran was meant to prove that Mohammed 
	was a prophet and not an impostor. The Arabs before Muhammed believed in 
	God, they even called Him Allah. They also believed that Allah had created 
	this world, which in itself, is the proof of His existence.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></i></b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">We must also remember that were we to accept that the 
	Quran is a divine book, then it must be in full agreement with science. Even 
	ninety-nine percent agreement is not good enough. One mere single mistake is 
	too many because God could never make mistakes—not even a single one for 
	that matter. Therefore, it is logical to accept that the <b><i>spotting of 
	only one mistake in the Quran is a sufficient proof that Quran is man made, 
	Mohammed is an impostor and Islam is a cult</i></b><i>.</i></span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">When Muslims say ‘<b><i>miracle’</i></b> they mean that 
	the Quran is in agreement with science. Of course, any published book is 
	expected to be in agreement with the current science of its time. The 
	possibility of a miracle is considered only if a book predicts or explains 
	scientific discoveries that are not within current human knowledge of its 
	time. This principle, when applied to the Quran requires historical research 
	to find out what was the generally accepted information about the scientific 
	issues which were <i>correctly</i> mentioned in the Quran. It doesn’t take a 
	genius to understand that when there is a scientific error, we don’t even 
	have to go through the pain of historical research.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">Most of us tend to think ancient civilizations as 
	primitive, and its greatness is merely relative to its time. Careful reading 
	of history, however, will surprise the researchers with the quality and 
	volume of scientific progress made in those ages. It seems that we are 
	fooled by the scientific leaps man made in the last two or three centuries 
	of human civilization. We mustn’t forget that most of our recent scientific 
	discoveries are secondary to technological achievements. Technology has made 
	it possible for us to achieve in hours what used to be achieved in weeks.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">The Arab world passed through a brief period of 
	renaissance during the last century. The Arabs revolted against the Ottoman 
	Empire to the painful fact that they were well behind the west in science 
	and technology. The Europeans were seen by the Arabs as their national enemy 
	and as the occupying forces of the Arabs. At the same time they also 
	realised they (the Arabs) had a great deal to learn from the Europeans. Arab 
	counties were struggling to gain their independence, which they eventually 
	achieved. The future seemed to be bright but there was hard work to be done 
	to catch up with the west. </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">This period was marked with some decline in the interest 
	in religion among the Muslim Arabs. Muslim clerics were unable to provide 
	answers to questions of modern life and were often seen as obstacles to 
	development. Consequently, Muslim clerics lost some of their influence on 
	the rest of the population, and were often portrayed negatively in Arabic 
	culture.&nbsp; The <i>Muslim brotherhood movement</i> was banned and the general 
	public looked at its members with some suspicion. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">In the Arabian Peninsula things were moving in another 
	direction. The Saudi family just got hold of the country, thanks to their 
	alliance with the members of the newly formed <i>wahabi</i> religious sect 
	renowned for applying Islam in its most strict form. This coincided with the 
	discovery of oil in the country, which led to wealth on a scale never known 
	to the Arabs before. To spoil the party for the Saudis, this also coincided 
	with the appearance in Egypt of <i>President Nasser</i> with his nationalist 
	agenda. Nasser’s influence quickly covered the entire Arab world. Saudi 
	Arabia acquired the image of a backward country and had little influence in 
	the political stage. That was the age of Arab nationalism, which ended by 
	the death of its hero, Nasser, in 1970 only three years after the Arab’s 
	defeat in 1967 war. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">The vacuum left was immediately filled by Saudi Arabia 
	who aggressively promoted its brand of Islam <i>(Wahhabism)</i> to the rest 
	of the Arab and Islamic worlds. Saudi Arabia was well placed to do that, 
	thanks to its financial muscle. Saudi Arabia had millions of foreign 
	employees, who although were largely Muslims, had little interest in 
	religion. The system in Saudi Arabia is that all Muslims must practice their 
	religion, in other words, all male Muslims must pray in mosques, a small 
	inconvenience for the good money to earn.&nbsp; All mosques in the country are 
	run by Saudi <i>imams</i> and strictly preach only <i>wahabbi </i>Islam with 
	no tolerance for the other sects of Islam. Even though Saudi Arabia 
	recruited many scholars from many Arab and Islamic countries to teach in its 
	various institutes, these scholars were <i>converted</i> and were allowed to 
	teach Islam only the <i>wahabbi</i> way. To their liking, this system 
	resulted in a whole generation that has been brainwashed. The process was 
	made easier by the fact that most of those millions of employees had only 
	minimal knowledge in Islam, and therefore, were unwilling and incapable to 
	dispute the new teachings. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">Saudi Arabia applied those measures from the early days 
	of its creation but they were largely ineffective during the 50s and 60s. It 
	was because the Arabs were busy rallying behind Nasser in his push for Arab 
	nationalism. To make things even worse to the Saudis, Nasser managed to make 
	Egypt as the most influential Islamic country due to the presence in Egypt 
	of <i>Al Azhar University</i>, which was considered for hundreds of years as 
	the highest Islamic authority. In other words, Saudi Arabia was effectively 
	sidelined by Nasser, whose name will remain as one of the most hated names 
	to both the Saudis and Islamists.</span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">All these changed after Nasser’s death in 1970. Egypt 
	stepped being a leading force in the Arab and Islamic world, <i>Al Azhar</i> 
	lost its status to Saudi institutions, and many of its scholars were 
	recruited by Saudi Arabia and <i>converted</i> to preach their brand of 
	Islam. The once-banned radical Muslim brotherhood movement was resurrected.&nbsp;

	<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Verdana"><span lang="EN-GB">These were 
	the perfect settings for the Islamic movements to make a comeback with a 
	vengeance. They promoted Islam aggressively—their message to people was that 
	all the problems in the Islamic world, including the defeat of the Arabs in 
	1967, are due to the non-adherence to the strict teachings of Islam. In this 
	sense it is only fair to say that the Islamic movements emerged as clear 
	winners after 1967. They used the defeat to support their argument in 
	attacking nationalism and advocating Islamic fundamentalism as an 
	alternative.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">Islamic movements were aware that Islam and science do 
	not mix well, which is hardly a problem to any true Muslim, who always see 
	Islam to be right and science to be wrong. However, if they want to make the 
	religion more acceptable to others, whether Muslims or non-Muslims there are 
	many questions to be answered. The rescue came from <i>Maurice Bucaille</i>, 
	a French doctor who worked for the Saudi king and wrote a book in the 1970s 
	about the Bible, the Quran and modern science. Oil money seems to have paid 
	well. To the Islamists this is like winning the jackpot.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">Saudi Arabia established a generously financed government 
	organization whose purpose is not just solving the incompatibilities between 
	the Quran and science but to go even further and claim that the Quran has 
	many scientific miracles. They recruited Muslim scholars and scientists from 
	around the world and targeted western scientists. This strategy apparently 
	brought much successes. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">To this point, I must say that I never met a friend or a 
	colleague who carefully had read Maurice Bucaille book, although they all 
	know about it. But that does not matter. What matters is the fact that a 
	western Christian has admitted that the Quran is scientifically accurate. If 
	a Muslim wrote such a book it would not make such an impact, as <b><i>the 
	material contained is not the issue, the author is</i></b>. Speaking of 
	myself I read the book during the height of my religious interest and was 
	never really convinced of the arguments in it, but who cares? What matters 
	is that there is an admission from a western Christian intellectual that the 
	Quran is correct, scientifically. If such an admission comes from the enemy 
	camp why should I question it? I believed all the claims made in the book 
	not because they convinced me but because they happened to suit me.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">One cannot help wondering if Maurice Bucaille really 
	believed what he claimed about the divine origin of the Quran? He must have 
	read the Quran carefully and came across with the many verses in which Allah 
	makes it clear that the unbelievers will be burnt in hell fire for eternity. 
	For this fear alone, at the least, <i>Maurice Bucaille</i> should have 
	pronounced the <i>shahada</i> to save his soul. Some Muslims claim that he 
	had lately converted to Islam, a claim that does not make any difference to 
	this argument. He certainly didn’t know that he is going to live long enough 
	to re-think and convert to Islam, if it is true that he did. </span></font>

	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">Without 
	any doubt in their minds, the miracle scientists believe that the Quran is 
	Allah’s revelations to Mohammed. Therefore, everything in the Quran must be 
	absolutely accurate. This is their starting point, which they fully believe 
	to be an absolute fact. Everything else in life must give in to maintain the 
	integrity of this absolute belief. When the Quran doesn’t agree with 
	commonsense or logical thinking then these has to be adapted/modified to 
	conform with the Quranic logic. If the Quran disagrees with some scientific 
	principles then a Muslim must dismiss those scientific principles as wrong, 
	even if they appear to be correct in view of the overwhelming evidence. The 
	scientific evidence might change in the future (with Allah’s willing), but 
	the Quran will never change.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">True 
	Muslims will have no reservation in challenging the most basic scientific 
	fact, if it is not in line with the Quranic teachings. <b><i>Their golden 
	rule is that Allah is always right while everything else can be wrong</i></b>. 
	There is no problem with true Muslims in admitting that even when all the 
	available evidence points to the truth of a scientific fact, but if that 
	fact is not in line with Quranic teachings, it simply does not become a fact 
	at all! Any true Muslim will choose to be with Allah even when it is against 
	the whole world. However, these true Muslims understand that not all Muslims 
	have a perfect faith like theirs; therefore, proving that Quran is in 
	harmony with science is always welcome.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">Next in

	on whatever they want to say, and there is no shortage of scientists who are 
	willing to endorse, in return for money and fame, whatever appeals to the 
	miracle advocates. These scientists get invitations to appear in lavishly 
	organized meetings where the speakers make their claims of Quranic 
	agreements with science. The only other argument allowed in such meetings is 
	to praise their findings. The audience is usually overwhelmed by an 
	impressive introduction of a Muslim (or a non-Muslim) scientist, typically a 
	person who worked or qualified in the west, attended many international 
	meetings, appeared on many TV programmes and has many publications. This 
	way, the audience is already prepared to trust whatever this man is going to 
	say. Their usual evidence is something like, ‘as we <i>all know that this 
	has been scientifically proven beyond doubt…</i></span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB">The Quran has the stories of many prophets who were armed 
	with miracles, which serve the purpose of a divine stamp of authenticity. 
	For example, Moses had his famous stick, which converts to a snake and with 
	which he caused the sea to split. Sulaiman was in control of the wind and 
	the <i>jinn</i> and was able to understand the language of animals. Jesus 
	had the capability to cure the sick and wake up the dead. No human being who 
	witnesses any of those miracles can argue with it, although it was up to 
	them whether to believe in the prophet or not. When Moses converted his 
	stick into a snake no one in the audience said ‘<i>no you did not convert it 
	to a snake’</i> and this seems to be consistent in all the miracle stories 
	told in the Quran.</span></font></p>

	issues. It is supposed to be the chosen means of communication between God 
	and humans. The Quran keeps emphasising that it is a <i>clear book (mubeen)</i> 
	and suitable to all mankind. That is the theory; the reality is that all 
	these claims are far from true. It has been a useless <i>manual</i> for 1400

	<span lang="EN-GB">A legitimate question to ask when considering the subject

	prevailing scientific knowledge of the 7<sup>th</sup> century Arabia? I 
	think the answer is YES. All the evidence we have is that <b><i>the Quran 
	did not make any scientific statement that was seen absurd in its time</i></b>. 
	The Arabs of Mecca were very critical to the Quran in many ways; for 
	example, regarding its composition or regarding the insults to their idols, 
	but we do not know of a single incident when the Arabs objected to a Quranic 
	verse because of a scientific issue. That tells us that the Quran did not 
	say anything that was outside the Arab’s current scientific knowledge. <b>

	saying the earth is like a carpet, they did not see anything unusual in 
	that. They normally sat on their carpets in the open and placed few stones 
	(mountains) here and there to stabilise it. They did not see anything 
	unscientific in that.&nbsp; They also heard the verses, without raising any 
	eyebrows which describes the development of the human embryo. However, 1400 
	years later, we see a plethora of Muslim <i>miracle scientists</i> who claim 
	that the Quran is full with scientific knowledge which humans discovered

	<span lang="EN-GB">The late sheikh <b><i>Abdul Aziz Bin Baz</i></b> was in 
	his time the highest Islamic authority in Saudi Arabia, and to many Muslims 
	in the whole world. Sheikh Bin Baz was a man of unquestionable knowledge in 
	Islam and the Arabic language, and a very dedicated Muslim. As recently as 
	1982, he issued a <b><i>fatwa that earth is flat and those Muslims who say 
	otherwise contradict the Quranic teachings</i></b>. Sheikh Bin Baz was aware 
	that scientific discoveries point to a round earth that orbits the sun. He 
	was a true devout Muslim who had to choose between man made scientific 
	discoveries and the Quranic revelations. Being a dedicated Muslim Sheikh Bin 
	Baz decided to side with Allah who does not do mistakes. In 1982 scientists 
	had no doubt about the shape of earth, but Sheikh Bin Baz, on the other 
	hand, <b><i>had no doubt about the clarity of the Quranic revelations</i></b> 
	that made him issue his <i>fatwa</i> with confidence. He knew how it is 
	embarrassing for him in the scientific circles but he was willing to face 
	the whole world because of his confidence in the Quran.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">So how those miracle specialists extract a miracle from 
	such a clear error? As usual, they have to re-interpret the Quran, change 
	the laws of the language, even to extract new meanings from the words and to 
	bring logical thinking to an end. They say: When the Quran says earth is 
	flat it means the earth <b><i>appears</i></b> to be flat, so wherever you 
	are on earth it appears to you that the earth is flat, and thought of this 
	could happen only if the earth is round!!</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">But the Quranic verses do not mention the Arabic word for
	<i>appear</i> (tahsabuha) at all. The Quran has used words to mean <i>appear 
	to you</i> in other verses and could have used them in this context to make 
	its point, but it didn’t. Then what about those astronauts to whom the earth 
	does not appear to be flat but round?</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">Other Muslim apologists put another excuse for this 
	error. They claim that it would be unrealistic for the Quran to say the 
	earth is round to the 7<sup>th</sup> century Arabs, they would not believe 
	it! But then, this means the Quran was revealed only to confirm existing 
	wrong ideas. And why this gentle approach was not considered when it tells 
	them that birds and ants could speak to humans, or when it is told them that 
	a human&nbsp; (Mohammed) spent the night with Allah in the seventh heaven, and 
	had a sight-seeing tour to view hell and paradise?</span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">Other apologists focus on one word, <i>Dahaha</i>. 
	According to Arabic dictionaries and <i>tafseer</i> books, this word also 
	means flat. It is the bed, which an ostrich prepares to lay its eggs. Those 
	miracle experts noticed this word <i>eggs</i> and eureka! It’s a miracle! 
	The Quran knew 1400 years ago earth is round! But <i>dahaha</i> still means
	<b><i>flat</i></b>. </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">Other apologists looked everywhere in the Quran to find a 
	word that can possibly mean round and they found one in sura 39:5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>He 
	has created the Heavens and the Earth for Truth. He wraps the night up in 
	the day, and wraps the day up in the night. </i>The word <i>
	<span style="color:#993300">yukawer</span></i> translated here as wraps can 
	also mean to make like a ball but that does not refer to earth, it refers to 
	the day and night. Miracle scientists will see this as a hint made by the 
	Quran 1400 years ago about the shape of earth! &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-GB">I just wonder if the earth is really flat and Allah wants 
	to say it is flat, how can he say it and in what expression? <b><i>Are there 
	any other expressions left in the Arabic language that Allah has not used in 
	the Quran to give the meaning of flat?</i></b> Unless of course those 
	apologists think that Allah should use the English word FLAT to convince 
	them.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">
	Development of the human embryo</span></b></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">The Quran described the 
	development of the human embryo in a number of verses similar to this one 
	(Q.23: 12-14), which is the most quoted: <i>&quot;Verily We created man from a 
	product of wet earth, then placed him as a drop of seed in a safe lodging, 
	then We fashioned the drop a clot (<b>‘alaqa</b>), and of the clot (<b>‘alaqa</b>) 
	We fashioned a lump, and of the lump We fashioned bones, and We clothed the 
	bones (with) meat. Then We produced it as another creation.&quot;</i></span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">The way this verse is 
	structured in Arabic means that Allah created man from a drop which he 
	placed in a safe place (we assume it is the uterus), then this drop was 
	created into something sticky (alaq), then this sticky thing was made into a 
	lump (which looks like something that has been chewed) then this lump was 
	fashioned into bone, then Allah dressed this bone with flesh.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">The above verse used few 
	words <i>notfa</i> (drop), <i>alaqa</i> (sticky thing, or blood clot), <i>
	mudgha</i> (lump). I don’t see in this verse or in all the other verses 
	about this subject anything more than a description of what ladies could 
	describe after a miscarriage. Miscarriages can happen at various stages of 
	early pregnancy; so embryos look different in each stage.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">I keep 
	looking at this verse trying to find a miracle. Humans since the Stone Age 
	must have noticed that man’s semen was necessary for a woman to get 
	pregnant. They also must had noticed how embryos look like after 
	miscarriages at various stages of pregnancy. How else any woman in 7<sup>th</sup> 
	century Arabia would describe to us her understanding of the development of 
	the human embryo?</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">In connection with embryos, 
	the Arabs heard Mohammed saying this and the other verses, and they accepted 
	it with no criticism whatsoever. The Arabs, and indeed the Jewish tribes in 
	Arabia, criticised Mohammed whenever he said something that looks absurd to 
	them. On this occasion, they did not. There is not a shred of evidence that 
	this verse was met with any criticism. We must conclude that these verses 
	must have agreed with the prevailing knowledge of the 7<sup>th</sup> 
	century. </span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">Comparing with our time, we
	</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">
	have to admit that the 7<sup>th</sup> century </span>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">knowledge, although 
	appropriate for its time, was not accurate enough. </span>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">Where is 
	the science in the above verse or in other similar verses? Is there any 
	clear mention of the ovum? Why didn’t Allah know that the ovum is as 
	important as the sperm is? The above verse clearly states that the lump was 
	converted into bones, which implies that the whole lump was converted into 
	the skeletal system, which is then dressed with flesh? This does not at all 
	corroborate with our current understanding of embryology.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">It is 
	quite amazing to note that the Quranic verses describing the embryological 
	development contain scientific errors that the miracle experts like to see 
	as a miracle. On this they made a remarkable success when Prof. Keith Moore 
	of Canada fell into the trap set for him by the Saudi organization dealing 
	with the Quranic miracles. To the satisfaction of the Saudis Prof. Keith 
	Moore shamelessly accepted that Quran has an accurate description of the 
	development of the embryo. Overnight, Prof. Moore became a celebrity and was 
	treated as a VIP in his frequent trips to Islamic countries. He even 
	published a special edition of his book, apparently financed by Bin laden to 
	whom he made an acknowledgement. Prof. Moore’s statement is widely used by 
	Muslims who consider it as the end of discussion. </span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">I do not 
	claim for a minute any authority in the field of embryology, but this is not 
	about embryology. It is about commonsense. You don’t need to be an 
	embryology genius to spot the nonsense of extracting a miracle from a wrong 
	7<sup>th</sup> century statement. When the Saudis recruited Prof. Moore to 
	do his dirty part they meant just that. They wanted to silence any 
	freethinking about this subject and to stop any criticism to their false 
	claims.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify"><b>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">Baucaille 
	and Moore---do they believe their own claims?</span></b></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">These two 
	western scientists have given the Saudi organization dealing with Quranic 
	miracles more than they could dream of. Their support to Saudis false claims 
	is of tremendous magnitude, and has indirectly helped to fuel Islamic 
	extremism. History will always have personalities like these two who would 
	rather succumb to the temptation of fame and money rather than stand by 
	their principles. Money, especially Arab/oil money, it seems could really 
	buy the conscience of the so-called celebrated scientists and physicians.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">These two 
	scientists claimed that the Quran must have been revealed from Allah. It 
	does not matter if they are now Muslims or Christians. We know they made 
	their claims in the 70s and 80s and remained Christians for a long time, 
	probably until now! </span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana; color: windowtext">We find 
	this attitude difficult to digest. They must have read Allah’s threatening 
	verses in the Quran regarding the severe punishments awaiting the 
	unbelievers. If they really believed that the Quran is a divine revelation 
	then they should know that Allah does not compromise with the unbelievers, 
	unless they also believe their good relations with the Saudis might make 
	Allah forgive them.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">These two scientists made 
	their claims and disappeared from the stage! They only appeared in Islamic 
	sponsored meetings and refuse any interviews. They can only defend their 
	claims in an Islamic environment when all they hear is praise and 
	complements.</span></p>

	few of the moral codes of the Quran. The Quran does not only contain one or 
	two scientific errors, it is full with them. A book like this cannot be 
	attributed to Allah. It is not divine but man-made, and is badly made.
