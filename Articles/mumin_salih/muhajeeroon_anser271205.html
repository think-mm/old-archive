	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">FEW MUSLIM scholars and historians 
	disagree about the most important event in Islamic history. It was not the 
	birth of Muhammad in the year 570 AD or even the start of his revelations in 
	the year 610 AD. The majority of scholars will consider Muhammad’s 
	relocation to the northern city of Yathrib ( Hijra = migration) as the most 
	remarkable turning point in Islamic history. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Certainly, this was the opinion of 
	the early Muslims who lived and had witnessed the event about 1400 years 
	ago. When the second Khalifa Omar wanted to chose a starting point for the 
	new Islamic calendar (known as Hijri calendar) he did not chose the year 
	when Muhammad was born or the year when he started his call for Islam. Omar 
	and fellow Muslims decided on the year 622 AD because they knew very well 
	that REAL ISLAM only started after Hijra. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhammad was not the first or the 
	last Arab to claim to be a prophet. A Few ‘prophets’ actually co-existed 
	with him in different parts of Arabia. Musailama (Muhammad called him the 
	liar) was a successful prophet in his tribe. He had preceded Muhammad by few 
	years. Another interesting prophet was a lady (what a pity, it could have 
	been a first for the Arabs, perhaps) whose name was Sijah. Musailama and 
	Sijah, both attracted all their tribes as their followers--something 
	Muhammad could only achieve after twenty years of brutal force and 
	intimidation. Both Musailama and Sijah were not expansionists and they were 
	only interested to rule and preach quietly among their own tribes. But the 
	refusal by this duo to accept Islam resulted in the inevitable confrontation 
	between them and Muhammad. Muhammad was the only prophet warlord with an 
	organized army and a vision to fight and rule. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Arabs of Mecca </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Meccan Arabs belonged to a tribe 
	called Quraysh. They knew Muhammad very well since he was a child. When 
	Muhammad claimed to be a prophet they did what any civilized society would 
	do: they asked him for evidence of his claim of preophethood. All what 
	Muhammad could provide were a few verses of what later became known to be 
	the Quran. The Arabs of Mecca were the masters of the Arabic language and 
	were deeply involved in the theology of the time as their city was the 
	centre for the various religions practiced in Arabia in the seventh century. 
	Quraysh looked at the evidence produced by Muhammad and were not impressed. 
	They did not accept those verses as a divine proof and decided to reject 
	Muhammad’s claim. They were not biased or prejudiced and were happy to 
	consider the matter seriously in a fair manner; but when they examined the 
	evidence they knew it is a forgery and so rejected Muhammad’s assertion.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhammad tried his luck with other 
	tribes with further disappointments; He even went to the neighbouring city 
	of Taif with no success at all. His Islamic movement was in deep trouble and 
	was set to die. In a rescue attempt he asked those who followed him to seek 
	asylum in Abyssinia which was ruled by a Christian king. In preparation for 
	this journey Allah revealed some of the best verses about Christianity which 
	helped to impress the Christian king. This worked well and Muhammad learned 
	how to use Allah’s revelations to his best advantage to advance his career. 
	In Abyssinia some of Muhammad’s followers converted to Christianity and 
	stayed there. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhammad spent thirteen years in 
	Mecca propagating Islam with very little success, as only a few dozens of 
	Arabs, mostly his friends and relatives, joined him. His movement was set to 
	die just like many other movements before him. However, his fortune changed 
	dramatically when he met a group of Arabs belonging to the tribes of Aws and 
	Khazraj who live in the northern city of Yathrib. These Arabs agreed to join 
	Islam and invited Muhammad and his small number of followers to live with 
	them in their city. After Muhammad had immigrated to Yathrib in the year 622 
	A.D, the city was renamed as Medina. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Arabs of Medina </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The generosity of Medina Arabs to 
	Muhammad and his companions was unparalleled. Their hospitality covered all 
	his needs: from shelter to food and more importantly, the moral support he 
	needed so badly. Both tribes of Medina (Aws and Khazraj) accepted Islam 
	which quickly doubled the number of Muhammad’s followers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the beginning, Muhammad just 
	enjoyed the hospitality and was peaceful with everyone including the 
	Medina’s Jewish tribes. The Medina Arabs were now called Al-Ansar, which 
	means the supporters, while Muhammad’s Meccan companions were called 
	Al-Muhajeroon, which means the immigrants. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhammad’s only disappointment came 
	from the Jewish tribes in Medina. He hoped that after he had included in the 
	Quran some of the Old Testament stories and had prescribed in Islam some of 
	their practices, he would be accepted by the Jews. But to his chagrin, the 
	Jews of Medina denied Muhammad the recognition he desperately wanted. The 
	Jews were known in Arabia as the people of the book and the ones who knew 
	all about prophets. Therefore, their opinion about him was extremely 
	important for his prophetic image. But the rejection from the Jews was very 
	painful and insulting to Muhammad, and he could never forgive them for their 
	insolence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhammad never really cared much 
	about Al-Ansar and there are reasons to believe that he even looked down on 
	them. When Muhammad started to launch his aggressive wars (Ghazwas) he gave 
	clear priorities to his companions from Mecca in leadership and the war 
	booties. This occasionally triggered some bad feelings among Al-Ansar which 
	Muhammad dealt with very efficiently by revealing the latest Quranic verses 
	in support of his actions, a tactic that Muhammad used regularly to quiet 
	any criticism to his policies. The rest of Al-Muhajeroon too, concurred 
	fully with Muhammad’s views of Al Ansar and used them in the same way he 
	did. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Two breeds of Arabs </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is interesting to note the 
	difference in the approach adopted by the Meccan and the Medina Arabs 
	towards Muhammad. The Arabs of Mecca had known him since his birth and had 
	gone through the thirteen years of his prophetic claims, which they had 
	already rejected steadfastly. They called him anything from a liar to a mad 
	man to a poet but never called him a prophet. They heard the verses he 
	produced to support his claim and they said we produced better verses to 
	refute his claims! They heard the Quranic stories and said they had heard 
	this before! Muhammad was getting with them nowhere. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the other hand, the Arabs of 
	Medina believed Muhammad without asking any questions and without even 
	seeing the man or hearing the Quran! Only a few of their tribesmen met 
	Muhammad during their Hajj to Mecca and the rest just followed. They gave 
	Muhammad more than he could dream of. They allowed him and his group in 
	their city and provided them with food, shelter and protection which he 
	dearly needed. Now look at how Muhammad returned this favour: he took over 
	the city from them and made it a rule that none of AlAnsar will ever rule 
	the Islamic state as long as a Qurayshi is still in existence! Muhammad knew 
	only too well that those Ansars are too stupid to be trusted as rulers.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muhajeroon and Ansar -1400 years 
	later! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Muslim Brotherhood movement, 
	which is the mother of most of the current Islamic movements, has been 
	around for about eighty years. It started in Islamic countries among its 
	Sunni Muslim population, but was largely rejected by people and governments 
	alike. Even during the stage when it was supported by the west in the 1950s 
	and 1960s it made no impact on ordinary Muslims. Hizbul Tahrir was the 
	second Islamic movement to appear in the Middle East and started soon after 
	the Second World War with almost no successes at all. Its members, like 
	those of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, were living in the Middle East 
	like outcasts. The rejection of these Islamists was mainly from the very 
	Muslims who found more appeal in other national movements of the time.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The current Islamic movements 
	started in its own Mecca and among its own population, but for decades 
	failed to make any real progress. Just like Muhammad failed in his own 
	Mecca! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These current Islamists turned their 
	eyes to the west which they saw as the new Ansars. And they were not 
	disappointed. The western civilization has a built-in structural fault 
	called Political Correctness which aims to make stupidity, not common sense 
	prevail. The west received these Islamists (some actually call themselves al 
	Muhajeroon!) with open arms and provided them with food, shelter and 
	protection which they badly needed to propagate their religion, just like 
	the Ansar of Medina did to Muhammad and his companions! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These new Muhajeroon despise the 
	west (the new Ansar) just like Muhammad did to his own Ansar! Today’s 
	Islamists are only interested in making use of the benefit system and civil 
	liberty laws available in the west under the protection of political 
	correctness. Under such protection, they plan to use to their advantage, all 
	the facilities available in the west to propagate the real Medina Islam, 
	including their plans of ghazwas—just like Muhammad did in Medina. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even though they are yet to be 
	powerful to make any dent in the western civilisation, these Islamists 
	audaciously make it clear they want to take over the city, under the 
	protection of the politically correct western Ansars! Just like Muhammad 
	did.</font></p>
