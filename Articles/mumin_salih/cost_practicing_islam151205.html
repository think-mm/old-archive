	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">RECENTLY, there have been many 
	writings trying to explain why Muslims in general tend to underachieve 
	compared to others. It is ironic that Muslims own the largest oil reserves 
	in the world but their countries remain underdeveloped. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You can read this article by Thierry 
	Gattuso addressing the same issue. Apparently, the article was read by a 
	Muslim intellectual who came up with the solution that more Islam is needed. 
	You can read the comments of Ali Sina on the response of Muslims to the 
	crisis in this article. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims seem to behave like drug 
	addicts who always need more of the same stuff to relieve their withdrawal 
	symptoms. Muslims just cannot face the crisis head on and cure themselves 
	from this seventh century ideology; instead, they ask for more. This 
	stimulated me to write this essay about the price we are paying for 
	practicing Islam and the price humanity has paid for keeping Islam alive for 
	so long. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although I am not an economist, I 
	delved into this topic to highlight the sheer economic non-sense inherent in 
	Islam. This analysis will remind us of some idea of what sort of money we 
	are talking about, rather than being an accurate estimate of the price that 
	the Muslims pay for practicing their faith. Mind you, in this analysis, I 
	have not even taken into account the price we are paying for jihad because 
	all the money in the world does not bring back one lost life. Mohammed ruled 
	in Medina for only ten years, during which he fought over seventy aggressive 
	wars! This tradition of Islamic warfare continued immediately after his 
	death and has been continuing up to our time. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Units of Measurements</b> </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us first agree on how to 
	calculate the cost and which currency to use. The easiest way is to avoid 
	any national currency so that we do not have to do any conversions. I am 
	going to use man-hours as a unit of measurements. Let us agree that a one 
	man –hour is the work produced when a man works for one hour. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An average person works eight hours 
	a day and five days a week. The rest of the time should be used for rest and 
	family/ leisure activities which are as essential to life as work itself is, 
	if not more. I am not a pure economist or a qualified engineer, but I am 
	told that building a commercial aircraft is one of the most complicated 
	engineering projects of our time because of the millions of components 
	involved. Such a massive project apparently costs a staggering one million 
	man-hours! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">The cost of reading the Quran
	</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Reading is normally a very efficient 
	utilisation of time. It is usually informative and educational and can be a 
	relaxing and very enjoyable pastime activity. We may dislike or disagree 
	with what we read, but we still consider the time spent in reading as useful 
	because of the information obtained about the subject or even about the 
	knowledge about the writer or publisher. However, it is unlikely that anyone 
	will read the same book again and again, certainly not everyday, regardless 
	of how interesting the book is. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Arabs came across the Quran some 
	1400 years ago and they didn’t like it. But when Mohammed seized power he 
	forced it on them using his claim of divine authority. This is not at all 
	similar to forcing the Red book on the Chinese, it is far worse. The Arabs, 
	now called Muslims under Mohammed’s Islamic regime, were forced to revere 
	the book, read it everyday and brainwash their children with it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A Muslim cannot allow his mind, for 
	even one second, to think of the Quran as a boring book, full with 
	absurdities, because of the intense fear built in his mind since childhood. 
	Muslims have a built in internal system that automatically oppresses their 
	minds and stops them from ever thinking of expressing their true feelings 
	towards their religion. They are conditioned to believe that such bad 
	thoughts are not theirs but from Satan, therefore, should be rejected 
	outright. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims are supposed to read the 
	Quran on daily basis, and at least once in a year (in Ramadan) If only one 
	tenth of Muslims (i.e., at least 100 million Muslims) read the Quran once in 
	a year that means three billion man-hours are spent just to read the Quran 
	once in a year. That is assuming a speed of twenty pages an hour for thirty 
	days, and is enough to produce three thousands commercial jets! Come to 
	think of this!! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Just think of how many tens of 
	thousands of Muslims are engaged at this moment of time in debates trying to 
	cover up the mistakes in the Quran and re-interpret its verses to defend its 
	nonsense. Just ponder on what Muslims could do with those billions of man- 
	hours by just ignoring a book that says things like the earth is flat and 
	the sun orbits the earth. The annual cost of Reading the Quran is: three 
	billion man-hours a year </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">The cost of prayers </font></b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">An average Muslim will spend at 
	least an hour a day to perform the five daily prayers. Men, who ideally 
	should go to the mosque to perform their prayers, spend even more time. 
	Islamic societies, like Saudi Arabia, where all men have to go to mosques 
	for prayers, allocate about half an hour for each prayer during which all 
	businesses must stop completely. More time is needed for special prayers 
	like Friday and Eid prayers. This, what an Islamic government would enforce 
	once in power in any Islamic country. If only one tenth of Muslims are keen 
	worshipers, then we have more than two hundreds and fifty millions man- 
	hours wasted just to perform the five daily prayers! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Multiply this number by 335 days 
	(After subtracting Ramadan days, which is calculated separately) and we get 
	a figure of 83.750.000.000 The annual cost of performing the prayers is: 
	83.750.000.000 man-hours a year </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">The cost of Hajj </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">About two million people perform 
	hajj every year, a ritual which takes only few days to complete. However, in 
	practice, it takes a Muslim an average of ten days to complete the ritual. 
	The official Hajj holiday in Saudi Arabia is actually about two weeks. 
	Actual Hajj is just around an hour’s hard work, Simple calculations will 
	give us a figure like 480 millions man-hours lost, assuming the two million 
	people dedicated ten days each for the Hajj. The pilgrimage of course 
	affects all Muslims everywhere and involves considerable preparations and 
	extra financial demands. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And there are health and safety 
	issues too. Saudi Arabia, being an oil rich country, is currently capable to 
	provide some essential facilities for the pilgrimage. However, this remains 
	far from enough. Every year we hear about the thousands who are killed and 
	injured due to stampedes, illnesses and cross infections. It is a common 
	knowledge that everybody that comes back from the Hajj usually comes back 
	with a respiratory infection. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In every Islamic country, there are 
	special government departments to organise the journey to the Hajj. This is 
	more evident in Saudi Arabia which employs extra measures and deploys extra 
	staff to deal with such a massive influx of people. Assuming the country has 
	only five millions of employees who have to stop working for only ten days 
	then four hundreds million man- hours are lost just in Saudi Arabia. Add 
	this to above figure of 480 millions man- hours we get a total of 880 
	millions man-hours. Considering other Islamic countries losses then a one 
	billion man-hours lost must be a very conservative estimate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The annual cost of the Hajj is: one 
	billion man-hours. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">The cost of Ramadan fasting
	</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims in general like to consider 
	Ramadan as a month dedicated for fasting and worshipping. Working hours in 
	most Islamic countries are reduced substantially, as Muslims do not allow 
	normal daily activities to affect the spiritual atmosphere. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims start the working day late 
	and finish early and spend the day hours in a state of physical and mental 
	exhaustion, because of the state of hypoglycaemia secondary to their 
	fasting. However, Muslims just love to deny this simple physiological fact, 
	and try to convince themselves that fasting is good for health, and will 
	produce a typical Islamic research that defies the academic standards and 
	designed to produce results to prove their point. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the evenings, Muslims suffer 
	of dumping syndrome due to eating too much after fasting for too long. They 
	may suffer of headaches and may feel unable to do their normal activities. 
	Muslims will then be busy performing taraweeh prayers that take about an 
	hour to complete. They will also perform other keyam prayers after midnight 
	that takes another hour to complete. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Suhur is a meal taken very late at 
	night, when the usual medical recommendation is not to eat before retiring 
	to bed. But suhur is a meal that is recommended by Muhammad; therefore, 
	Muslims will just eat it regardless of any medical advice. After that there 
	is a fajr (morning) prayer, which needs to be performed before eventually 
	retiring to bed in the early morning. Undoubtedly, this will reflect on the 
	next day activities. In other words, it will be another day wasted. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It doesn’t matter how many Muslims 
	actually observe fasting, because the reduction in the working hours affects 
	everyone. If only one fourth or one fifth of Muslims go to work, that is 
	about two hundreds and fifty millions people. Working hours officially drop 
	from eight to six hours during Ramadan that gives us about five hundreds 
	millions man- hours lost every day. Multiply that by 30 and you get fifteen 
	billions man-hours lost during the month of Ramadan alone! Now, calculate, 
	how many jet aircrafts could be produced with this staggering number of man 
	hours? And that is assuming the rest of the working hours are efficiently 
	used which they are not. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The annual cost of fasting is: 
	fifteen billions man-hours. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Subtotal By adding all the above 
	billions of wasted man-hours we get a figure of: 102.750.000.000 man-hours.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">The intellectual cost </font></b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above astronomical numbers are 
	dwarfed compared to the tax Islam imposes on Muslim’s intellectual 
	activities. A true Muslim believes that science is about learning Quran and 
	Hadith( Muhammad’s sayings and deeds) they say in Arabic: alelmu aya aw 
	hadith, which means just that. The Arabic word for Muslim clerics is ulama 
	which mean scientists! Other sciences, like physics and maths, are 
	considered to be only auxiliary. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is the duty of Muslims to read 
	the Quran as many times as possible, and preferably know it by heart. They 
	also need to know its interpretation. After the Quran comes the hadith and 
	sunna which Muslims are also expected to know in some details. Having done 
	that, Muslims have to read the sirah, which is the life story of Muhammad, 
	and the rest of Islamic history. For non-Arabs, we can add the time spent in 
	mastering the Arabic language. A Muslim must know at least the basics of 
	sharia law in order not to miss out in the race to paradise. Muslims must 
	know what to say when they wake up in the morning, and what to say when they 
	go to bed at night. They must know what duaa (prayers) to say at the 
	beginning of a meal, or at the end of it. They need to know which duaa to 
	say as they go to the toilet or step outside the house or when they travel. 
	There is a duaa for every occasion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having completed all that, a Muslim 
	is expected to keep up to date with current Islamic sciences and research. 
	For example, they are expected to know about the therapeutic capabilities of 
	reading the Quran and hadith and their applications to their daily lives. A 
	very important Islamic science is called altebbu alnabawi meaning medicine 
	according to the prophet. Muslims believe that just mentioning the word 
	Allah is very soothing to the mind, while dipping both wings of a fly in 
	one’s food provides cure from illness. True Muslim doctors and intellectuals 
	believe in these Islamic medicines more than they believe in their text 
	books or man-made medicines, and will direct their scientific research to 
	prove their point. They will manipulate scientific and medical research; in 
	the same way they manipulate the Quranic interpretation, to produce results 
	to their liking. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">True Muslims must believe in Jinns 
	(invincible creatures) as a very influential factor in causing illness and 
	family crises to humans, and they are expected to learn from the Quran and 
	sunna how to deal with these creatures. Muslims also believe in dreams and 
	will read books and waste hours in front of televisions to learn about the 
	interpretations of dreams according to the Quran and sunna. Dreams are 
	believed to be messages from Allah (or may be from the Satan) which needs to 
	be decoded! Almost every Middle Eastern television channel has dedicated 
	programmes to educate people on how to interpret dreams or deal with jinns.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Having completed all those rituals 
	and Islamic mumbo-jumbo,, and Muslims still have some free and functioning 
	brain cells, they may learn some other sciences. But true Muslims do not 
	normally waste their time reading about other civilizations or religions, 
	and those few who do, only do so for the purpose to learn how to attack it. 
	True Muslims do not believe in music, photography, paintings, sculptures, 
	performing arts or any fine arts. All these are sins! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is a very sad fact that in a 
	Muslim’s library you can only find books related to Islam or, if there is 
	still some room, the Islamic view of other cultures. You will not find a 
	true Muslim reading about Hindu or Chinese cultures because they are, to 
	Muslims, not even worth reading. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us put a dollar value to the 
	man-hours wasted in Islamic activities. Assume an average wage of USD 10.00 
	per hour. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, multiply this average wage rate 
	with the staggering figure of 102.75 billion man-hours. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Total annual cost of practicing 
	Islam is incalculable! It is more than one trillion USD per year. Yeah, the 
	Muslims are just throwing away more than a trillion dollars/year doing 
	Islamic mumbo-jumbo! No wonder, worlds poorest countries are the Islamic 
	nations! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It seems to me that Muslims 
	underachieve because they do not have time!</font></p>
