	<hr width="40%">
	<p align="justify"><tt><font face="Verdana">Most of us, if not all, agree 
	that there are many good Muslims around who believe in the same human values 
	that are common to all nations and cultures and, at the same time, practice 
	their religion with moderation and without jeopardizing their relations with 
	others. This kind of Muslims genuinely believes that Islam teaches peace, 
	love and other good social values. Many ex-Muslims may have once belonged to 
	this category, until they started to dig deep on Islamic knowledge and 
	discover more about the untold secrets of Islam.<br>
	<br>
	Those so-called good Muslims (described above), as well as many western 
	apologists of Islam, ardently believe that there is no problem with Islam 
	itself, but the real problem lies in its correct understanding and 
	appropriate application. Some may wonder why we don’t promote this good 
	brand of Islam as an alternative to radical Islam. This essay will explain 
	why this is only a wishful thinking as moderate Muslims can easily turn to 
	radicalism.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Marketing Islam<br>
	<br>
	The Islamic package comes in several stages: in the first stage, Muslims are 
	introduced to a soft aspect of Islamic teachings which is purported to be in 
	harmony with natural human, instincts like relations with parents and giving 
	charities. Following today’s fashion you may also add the emphasis on the 
	myths of Quranic miracles which only exist in the minds of Islamic scholars. 
	With this, also include some favorable quotations made by westerners for 
	various reasons and in peculiar circumstances which is outside the scope of 
	this essay.<br>
	This is an introductory phase designed to establish allegiance to Allah, 
	i.e. to Mohammed’s teachings. This is always kept nicely polished and 
	claimed as ranking high at the top of the Islamic package. Marketing Islam 
	in this way reminds me of how shops in many Islamic countries sell big boxes 
	of fruits and vegetables: the top layer contains the best selection while 
	underneath the fruits may be<br>
	rotten.<br>
	<br>
	It is possible to preach a good brand of Islam and still be able to support 
	the arguments with a number of moderate Quranic verses and Hadiths. Most 
	Muslims follow such approach when they start practicing Da’awa (calling for 
	Islam) and it is a recognized Islamic practice to use even financial 
	incentives to tempt people to join in the fold of Islam. The Quran made it 
	clear that such new comers (Al Muaalafat Kulubohom) who are still not sure 
	of Islam are given Zakat money to help them to make their decision, which is 
	the practice in Saudi Arabia today. It comes as a no surprise that many good 
	Muslims see Islam from the moderate verse’s and ahadith points of view and 
	believe it to be a religion of peace and noble social values. They would 
	usually produce the same set of moderate Quranic verses and hadiths in 
	defence of their religion.<br>
	<br>
	It is during this stage that a Muslim commits himself/herself to the 
	absolute obedience and total submission to Allah, that is, to Mohammed’s 
	teachings--as if they sign a contract with Allah that becomes binding 
	immediately. Once this stage is achieved and a Muslim signs the agreement 
	with Allah, the rest is just a matter of reading the small print when other 
	Islamic teachings about slavery,aggressive wars and treatment of others will 
	come to light. Only then they<br>
	realise there is more to true Islam than what they had initially learned.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Covenant of Allah<br>
	<br>
	The Quran makes many references to this kind of agreement between Allah and 
	Muslims using the word Ahd (Arabic for Covenant) this word can also be used 
	to mean an agreement or contract in Arabic.<br>
	<br>
	Read the following Quranic verses to see how Allah sees this covenant<br>
	(Translations of Yusuf Ali)<br>
	<br>
	Q.2:27 Those who break Allah's Covenant after it is ratified, and who sunder 
	what Allah has ordered to be joined, and do mischief on earth: these cause 
	losses (only) to themselves.<br>
	Q.2:40 …and fulfil your Covenant with Me as I fulfil My Covenant with you, 
	and fear none but Me.<br>
	Q.16:91 Fulfil the Covenant of Allah when ye have entered into it ….<br>
	Q.16:95 Nor sell the Covenant of Allah for a miserable price: for with Allah 
	is (a prize) far better for you, if ye only knew.<br>
	Q.13:20 Those who fulfil the Covenant of Allah and fail not in their 
	plighted word;<br>
	Q.33:15 And yet they had already covenanted with Allah not to turn their 
	backs,and a covenant with Allah must (surely) be answered for.<br>
	Q.33:23 Among the Believers are men who have been true to their Covenant 
	with Allah: of them some have completed their vow (to the extreme), and some 
	(still)wait: but they have never changed (their determination) in the least:<br>
	Q.48:10 ….. and anyone who fulfils what he has covenanted with Allah, Allah 
	will soon grant him a great Reward.<br>
	It appears from the above verses that the Quran is talking about a contract 
	between Allah as the first party and Muslims as the second party, and it is 
	very important that Muslims must fulfil their part of the contract in order 
	that Allah fulfils His part. Let us have a look at some of its clauses.<br>
	<br>
	According to this contract, the second party (Muslims) promises to pronounce 
	The Shahada, which is the single most important pillar of Islam and makes 
	the difference between a Muslim and a non-Muslim. The Shahada (in Arabic it 
	means seeing or eye witnessing) is a statement made by a Muslim that he/she 
	is a witness that Allah is God, and that Mohammed is his messenger. 
	Considering that not a single Muslim has ever seen Mohammed in the last 
	thirteen centuries you know what a big flat lie this is! It is amazing the 
	number of Muslims who are willing to make such a wrong statement in front of 
	God! The first part of the<br>
	Shahada is also a self contradicting statement as it is about giving the 
	name Allah to God. If Muslims really believe there is only one God then why 
	he needs a name, especially a pagan name?<br>
	<br>
	Also, according to this contract, the second party (Muslims) will commit 
	themselves to a total trust in Mohammed’s teachings without ever questioning 
	them even when they seem so bizarre. Muslims are not committed to trust 
	human minds unless they are in agreement with Mohammed’s teachings, because, 
	according to them human minds can be misleading. Islam (which means 
	submission, not peace) demands total blind faith from its followers. 
	Therefore, Muslims are expected to place their total trust in Mohammed’s 
	teachings, no matter how much<br>
	absurd they might sound. When Mohammed says dip the fly in your food because 
	there is cure in its wing then that must be true regardless of what science 
	says. Muslim intellectuals devised various excuses to help their brains 
	swallow such inedible nonsense, such as: saying ‘who knows? May be in the 
	future science will prove it right! Allah knows best’<br>
	<br>
	In effect, Muslims accept to put their brains to rest as no more thinking is 
	required. A Muslim’s mind is mainly used to read and memorise the Quran, 
	hadiths and other Islamic studies. Outside the Islamic field, a Muslim’s 
	mind can only be used to augment whatever information already exists in the 
	Islamic library and must always come to the conclusions that are supportive 
	to the Islamic ideology. Other conclusions will not be tolerated and may 
	even be treated as<br>
	crimes that might be punishable by death sentence.<br>
	<br>
	In return for the above, Allah (the first party), promises victory to 
	Muslims in this life, and Paradise in the next life. Allah is the tool used 
	by Mohammed to discipline his followers and is still used for this purpose 
	in our time. To avoid His severe punishment in life and after life Muslims 
	are in constant fear of upsetting Allah, and there is no shortage of 
	examples in the Quran of how Allah had punished those who disobeyed Him in 
	the past. At certain stage, Allah nearly annihilated the entire human race 
	from the face of earth. This is why<br>
	when a committed Muslim is asked to become a suicide bomber he/she has no 
	choice but to oblige—can a Muslim ever dare to disobey Allah?<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Making of a radical Muslim from a good one<br>
	<br>
	Good Muslims are good so long as they are still in full personal control of 
	their minds. Even then, they are within the reach of the hands of 
	radicalism. All it takes to make fundamentalists from good Muslims is to 
	produce some of the radical verses or hadiths to show them how they are in 
	breach of their contract with Allah and, by agreement; they will shut up and 
	be convinced. The weakness<br>
	of Muslims is: they agreed to surrender their minds’ abilities to reason. 
	They surrender their minds to a 7th century man whom they never met or 
	seen—a man who painted for them a brutal picture of Allah which they are not 
	allowed to dispute<br>
	for one second.<br>
	<br>
	Good Muslims are carriers of a deadly virus of cult; they feel healthy and 
	appear healthy but are always vulnerable to develop the full blown disease. 
	The very fact that they are good puts them under increased risk of giving up 
	the controls of their minds to Mohammed’s teachings to honour their contract 
	with Allah. Once that happens, it is only a matter of time when they will be 
	sucked into the black hole of radical Islam.</font></tt></p>
