	&nbsp;<div class="body">
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I must thank Prof Hashmi for his 
	kind words about me
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/27603">in his 
	latest response</a> to my rather harsh criticism of his comments about the 
	early Bangladesh history. I am particularly thankful to him for not 
	personalizing the criticism or reducing the level of civility in our 
	discussion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No matter how we feel about a 
	particular leader or leaders, a political party or parties, and how we view 
	a particular period in history, we have to keep a minimum level of decorum 
	and a certain level of logic and objectivity to have a fruitful discussion.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have no hesitation to mention here 
	that I found Professor Hashmi’s book, “Pakistan as a Peasant Utopia’ 
	scholarly and very informative about the Muslim peasantry of British Bengal. 
	I found it quite useful while I was writing a long article, entitled, “ 
	Banglar Musalmander Utsho” (The Origin of Bengali Muslims) , appeared some 
	years back serially in a Bengali daily in Dhaka. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I just could not stand seeing the 
	author of ‘Utopia’ on a slippery slope of partisan bickering and Mujib-bashing.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Professor Hashmi must have noticed 
	that although my language in ’Metamorphosis’ may not be termed friendly, my 
	objective was not to demean him but to remind him that he was a professor in 
	the very field--and that he could not effort to be frivolous or petty like 
	the others (’partisan critics of the street variety‘) . Even if he intensely 
	disliked Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his (‘autocratic‘, ‘corrupt’ or however 
	he describes )-- rule , it is incumbent on him to present his critic in a 
	public forum like a scholar. I only asked him to give his ideas a proper and 
	a wider perspective---a perspective of a scholar. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Recently , in an open forum, I wrote 
	the following to a distinguished Editor of a Dhaka daily in the similar 
	vain, when he used hyperbolic, over-inflated figures to criticize Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman’s rule : </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“ The period, January, 1972 to 
		August, 1975, is a very distinct and a very important part of the 
		history of Bangladesh and its people. The period was short---3 and a 
		half years, only about 1310 days. It is not hard to find the detailed 
		facts and figures of each of those days. I challenge the historians, the 
		scholars, the journalists and even the politicians to find the truth ( 
		as close to it as possible) and write about it to its bitter end and (in 
		the mean time) stop throwing tangential, venomous and hyperbolic 
		rhetoric just to satisfy one’s private or public vendetta.” </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 8 points I mentioned in my 
	earlier writing , there was hardly any adjective added to the name of Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman or his actions that would show that I was praising him or 
	supporting a particular action directly. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You looked only at the ‘empty’ side 
	of the glass and declared it empty, I only suggested there was a ‘filled’ 
	side also but did not say the glass was full. I also suggested that a 
	scholar of Bangladesh studies would look at the entire glass before passing 
	a judgement. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Professor Hashmi is correct in 
	realizing that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was not given a prize on a silver 
	platter---he had a mountain of problems to overcome. The post-liberation 
	Bangladesh, like most post-war countries--was in a mess. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this context, I did not mention 
	in my earlier communication a few other very important factors that directly 
	or indirectly shaped much of the history of post-liberation Bangladesh :
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(9) The presence of 6 divisions of 
	Indian Army within the territory of Bangladesh, and almost totally unguarded 
	wide open border-- etc. leading to what I would term -‘the India factor’ .
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(9) The factional divisions among 
	the various groups of Muktijuddhas and factions within Awami League itself.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(10) The problems related to the 
	trial of the Pakistani army personnel for war crimes, and the trial of the 
	collaborators--which the Pakistan later linked with the repatriation of the 
	stranded Bangalis in Pakistan and with Pakistan’s recognition of Bangladesh. 
	[Pakistani recognition came in February,1974 and United Nation’s in Sept/Oct 
	1974]. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If one asks me what was the most 
	vital factor that shaped the politics of Bangladesh after 1971, I have to 
	answer that it was ‘the India factor’---the fear and apprehension about 
	Indian domination or total absorption that evolved in the mind of a section 
	of the population. It is unfortunate that both the geography and history 
	placed Bangladesh in such a position that a large section of its elite class 
	( beside the so-called Islam-panthis) was consumed by a ’negative’ psychic 
	energy, fear. Much of Bangladesh’s political problems--- could be related to 
	this. One of the biggest failure of Mujib government was its failure to 
	understand and recognise the depth and extend of this ‘fear factor’. But 
	then --these are personal observations--and could be discussed in a separate 
	debate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before answering some of the 
	specific questions you raised, let me ask you, as a scholar of history, do 
	you think-- </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That even if all the complaints 
	against Sheikh Mujib’s rule---that you mentioned ( and you missed some 
	--like 1974 famine, police firing on the Student Union and Jasod crowd etc) 
	were true to the extend of your belief, was killing his entire family 
	including children, women and servants was the answer ? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Regarding my point #1, Professor 
	Hashmi wrote : </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;In a parliamentary system , the 
	Prime Minister is all powerful---so it was not a sacrifice for him etc.” 
	Look at my sentence in earlier write-up carefully, </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“(1) That Sheikh Mujibur Rahman gave 
	up the all-powerful position of the President created by the Proclamation of 
	Independence and chose to become a Prime Minister instead on the 12th of 
	January, 1972” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It appears that you probably ignored 
	the phrase--” created by the Proclamation of Independence”. The Proclamation 
	of Independence which came on the 10th of April, 1971, declared among other 
	things: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“ We the elected representatives of 
	the people--do hereby affirm and resolve that till such time as a 
	Constitution is formed, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman shall be the 
	President of the Republic----------that the President shall be the Supreme 
	Commander of the all the Armed Forces of the Repblic,shall exercise all the 
	Executive and Legislative powers of the Republic-------shall have the power 
	to appoint a Prime Minister and such other Ministers, as he considers 
	necessary-shall have power to levy taxes and expend moniesand shall have the 
	power to summon and adjourn the Constituent Assembly-- “ </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In other words, this instrument gave 
	the President virtually dictatorial power.<br>
	A quote from a book by Moudud Ahmed would show what happened afterwards :
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“ However, Mujib wanted to change 
	the system by exercising the legislative power he had as the President under 
	the Proclamation of Independence. Accordingly, on January 11, 1972 , by a 
	Presidential Order the entire character of the government was changed. The 
	Presidential form was substituted by a form aiming at a Westminister type 
	Parliamentary system through a decree called the Provisional Constitution of 
	Bangladesh Order, 1972.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[ Moudud Ahmed in ‘Era of Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman‘, page-7]. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If you read this document ( 
	Provisional Constitution) and compare the power of the Prime Minister in the 
	new system with that of the President of earlier system, it would be clear 
	to you that my expression was basically correct. All though I have no proof 
	, I suspect that your hearsay story about Tajuddin was probably manufactured 
	from the same factory---where the Satanic joke came from.. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On Siraj Sikdar : </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is what I wrote in a Bangladesh 
	newspaper recently: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Certainly the extra-judicial 
		killing of Siraj Sikdar will remain as a blot of the era of Sheikh 
		Mujibur Rahman. He (Sikdar) should have been brought to justice for his 
		insurgency.” </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shabbir Ahmed has already mentioned 
	in what context the name of Siraj Sikdar came in the speech of Bangabandhu 
	Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Parliament. In fact, the speech delivered on the 
	25th of January (some 24 days after the killing of Siraj Sikdar) was 
	delivered after the Parliament passed the 4th Amendment. The name of Siraj 
	Sikdar came in passing, after he already delivered some 3500 words out of 
	total of about 6000 words long speech describing in details some aspects of 
	the amendment. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was not a ‘bragging’ over a 
	murder as your comments suggest. If one follows that speech carefully then 
	it would be clear that he was bragging about catching/arresting Sikdar.
	</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Jey aaj manush-key rater 
		ondhokarey hottya korey, shey mone korey , takey keu dhortey parbena. 
		Kothay Siraj Sikdar ? Takey jodhi dhora jay, and tar dolbol --tader 
		shobaikey jodhi dhora jai, taholey dhortey parbona, kone officer ghush 
		khay ? etc.” </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As for ‘killing thousands of young 
	and not-so-young JSD and Sarbahara party men”, I appreciate the fact that 
	you kept the ‘number of killed’ vague unlike most critics who has a figure 
	of their own. I have no doubts many insurgents, mostly from the left groups 
	who carried on a ‘war’ against the government ( I once complied a list of 
	thana, police-farhi and police camp raids to about 200 during 1973-74), were 
	killed by Rakkhi Bahini, police and other law enforcement authority. Some 
	were killed during combat, some during raids for collecting arms and some 
	‘in custody’. Your ’Tara case’ is possibly one of the last category. I will 
	join in condemning a regime for any extra-judicial killing, but what I 
	contest is over exagerration and hyperbolic inference. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a Dhaka daily, a certain 
	gentleman, name CAF Dowla recently published an article-- </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In which after describing Rakkhi 
		Bahini as ‘Nazi Brown-shirt type sharp shooters’, and brutal ‘ killers 
		and rapists’ , wrote : “ JSD which perhaps bore the major burnt of the 
		brute force put the number of killings at 60,000,” He also mentioned 
		that two BNP ministers mentioned killing figures in the Parliament, 
		Altaf Hossain Choudhury ( 30,000) and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan (35,000).
		</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a reply, I wrote to the paper :
	</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I am holding in my hand an 
		original pamphlet circulated by JSD leaders during November, 1975. The 
		pamphlet, printed in Bengali, dated November 15, 1975, entitled, 
		DESHBASHIR PROTI MAJOR JALIL O ASM RAB-er ABEDON, has the following 
		expression about Mujib government’s repression against their party:
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“…..Sheikh Mujib amader shoho 
		JASOD, Bangladesher Chhatra League, Jatio Sramik League, Jatio Khishok 
		League-er DOSH HAJAR-ero beshi kormikey kara-garey nikkhep 
		korechhey---hotya kore EK HAJAR-ero odhik kormikey---” </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Almost all the top leaders of JSD 
	are still alive ( except Major Jalil). Will Mr Dowlah or any other writers 
	like him verify from the living leaders of the then JSD whether the number 
	of JSD workers killed by Rakkhi Bahini is 60,000, 35,000 or Ek hajarero 
	odhik’, before they take up their pen to brutalize the Rakkhi Bahini and 
	Shekh Mujib’s government ? If they need a copy of the pamphlet, I will 
	readily provide one.” No one has responded yet. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Moudud Ahmed , in his book ‘The Era 
	of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’ </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">spent some ten pages (p53-63) on the 
	genesis of formation of Rakkhi Bahini and then describing their 
	‘unregulated’ and ’uncontrolled’ activities, the indictments against them by 
	High Court Justices in two cases ( one ' a disappearance in custody case' 
	another torture and arrest of Aruna Sen , wife of a leftist leader Shanti 
	Sen , and her associates). He even wrote a few words of praise for Rakkhi 
	Bahini ( “ It is not true that the Rakkhi Bahini did not do anything good. 
	They recovered a large quantity of arms and smuggled goods and the hoarders 
	and black marketers were frightened of them “) then goes on to say the 
	Rakkhi bahini failed to keep its image because it was used for political 
	purposes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And then described how RB was 
	partisan and did not harass AL hoarders or black marketers etc. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But what is amazing is that in the 
	reference note to the phrase “for political purposes”, he writes : “ The 
	opposition parties claimed that in its first 2 years the Rakkhi Bahini 
	killed 30,000 young political workers”--and then nothing else--no 
	corroborating name either of a person or a party or any published reference 
	. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I think the hatred and strong 
	feeling against Rakkhi Bahini rose from two factors : (1) India factor---Moudud 
	describes it this way : “ A large section of the public alleged that Rakkhi 
	Bahini was an extension of Indian authority in Bangladesh”[page 62] </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(2) The entire Rakkhi Bahini was 
	composed of irregular Mukti Bahini guerrillas (mostly Mujib Bahini and 
	Kaderia Bahini, with minimum education and hailed from rural Bangladesh. How 
	could the elite, the urban, the Ashrafs accept the power of the subaltern ?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By theway, after 1975, almost the 
	entire body of the Rakkhi Bahini (the Indian agents ? the brutal 
	killers?)was absorbed into Bangladesh Army by Ziaur Rahman. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some of the answers to your other 
	questions , in particular , the one when you asked ‘whether I have given any 
	thought as to why so many ardent followers of Mujib changed their heart ' 
	will follow soon. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(End of Part I)</font><br>
