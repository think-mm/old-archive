  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><i>Dear friends,&nbsp;</i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><i>The following notes I made while in 
	Bangladesh last month. I hesitate sending this to MuktoMona. Most of you 
	already know of the situation in Bangladesh.&nbsp; However in the end I send this 
	because I face the old foe – daily life in the USA, daily life with its 
	mundane concerns, its petty routines.&nbsp; It inevitably erodes away a self that 
	one brings back from a visit home.&nbsp; And I don’t want to let it win so very 
	soon.&nbsp; Who among us has not had that heady feeling from being in the middle 
	of it all back at home? The immediacy of the problems, the outrage, the 
	fear, they all mingle with that lovely breeze, that friendly sunshine of 
	spring, with &nbsp;the rush of early memories of childhood, the enveloping warmth 
	of family and friends - &nbsp;and conjure a passion with events that is hard to 
	keep up here in the USA.&nbsp; No doubt the person who lived those eventful weeks 
	on the other side of the globe is different from the one who looks out today 
	in blank meditation at the vast loneliness of the New England snow. That has 
	to be so, but as many of you know, this separation of oneself is not 
	something we acquiesce to without a certain sadness. Hence, perhaps, this 
	posting. Dry and impersonal though the notes below are, they may yet bring 
	back to some of us that familiar compound of joy and anguish:&nbsp; the visit 
	home.&nbsp;</i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><i>The material for this summary of 
	February has been drawn from daily newspaper reports and personal interviews 
	with, among others, journalists Shariar Kabir, Shameem Akhter, Abdur Rob of 
	Proshika, Kazi Mukul and other members of Nirmul Committee, the ex-mukti 
	joddha Shireen Banu and many, many, &nbsp;young activists of the 1971 Memorial 
	library, Mirpur Branch, Dhaka.&nbsp; &nbsp;</i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><i>All our friends in Bangladesh are happy to meet with 
	expatriates and others who would like to know more about the situation at 
	first hand. It is a wonderful experience to do so, as I try to say below. 
	And let’s not forget – it is at least one victory against daily life!</i></p>

	- New Power Balance?</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The indications 
	have been reaching us abroad in the more dramatic news clippings recently.&nbsp; 
	They however do not prepare one for a stay in Bangladesh when one faces the 
	fear in friends or hears the innumerable stories that are always the same.&nbsp; 
	&nbsp;Nothing substitutes being there in person.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we all know, 
	the development over the last year or so is the prominence of the Islamists 
	in the politics of Bangladesh. This trend has been brought to the fore 
	recently by attacks on prominent secular people, including poets, 
	intellectuals, activists and senior opposition party members like Mr. 
	Kibriya.&nbsp; We may recall that these recent attacks were preceded by yet more 
	widespread and intense violence against minorities for several years now.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today’s change is 
	the boldness and openness in which upper class people are targeted.&nbsp; It is 
	intimidation of the general public raised to a new level, not just by the 
	killings and death threats but &nbsp;by the many small displays of power by the 
	Islamists, &nbsp;such as the introduction of the ‘Azan’ inside the airport, or 
	the recitation of the Quran at the inauguration of the 21<sup>st</sup> 
	February event.&nbsp; These latter are indeed tips of the iceberg, and there are 
	many of them. The iceberg proper is the grassroots work done by Jamaat and 
	Co. over the last 25 years and more that gives them unprecedented power 
	today.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Efficiency of 
	the Islamists</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is widely known 
	that the Jamaat and their likes recruits wide and deep and nurture recruits 
	all the way into maturity.&nbsp; Shireen Banu&nbsp; is an ex-freedom fighter and 
	speaks out on the issues.&nbsp; She had incredible stories.&nbsp; Yes, of course she 
	has received death threats recently, and once she personally had to confront 
	some jihadists near Comilla who it seems were bent upon attacking her 
	physically.&nbsp; She was convinced that none were more than fourteen years of 
	age, all alike in their zombie like utterances.&nbsp; And after a passing 
	discussion at Dhaka College where her son disagreed with some Islamists, 
	they found out his address in a couple of days &amp; were at her house armed 
	with “books” for her son to read.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, the above 
	were mere student supporters.&nbsp; The big boys, as we know, are the militias, 
	and according to Government intelligence reports, there are over 15 Islamic 
	militias operating in the country.&nbsp; Everybody knows about the New York Times 
	report which attributed 10,000 armed men to Bangla Bhai, but according to 
	Shariar Kabir the figure should be between 25 to 50 thousand men, just for 
	this one group. It would not be a difficult accomplishment with the 
	financial and support from patrons in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.&nbsp; Their 
	money goes a long way to provide incentive to a population of young people 
	who otherwise have little to look to, and helps to establish them in 
	society.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Support by BNP</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Support by the BNP 
	is part of the above efficiency.&nbsp; The Islamists were also at least 
	indirectly helped by the Awami League, a substantial discussion in itself. 
	By all accounts Islamists have infiltrated all levels of the administration. 
	One need only follow the headlines of the newspapers to see the relation of 
	the government to the Islamists. Till just some days ago the government 
	officials (and their supporters) categorically &amp; routinely denied the 
	fundamentalist strain in the general violence.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden, on the 
	24<sup>th</sup> Feb there was the admission that, oh! yes, Bangla Bhai/JMB 
	and others were active for years, and “arrests” followed.&nbsp; The February 24<sup>th</sup> 
	issue of Daily Star shows the smiling faces of some of the arrested 
	Islamists, including the notorious Dr. Asadullah Al Galib, a professor in 
	Rajshahi University.&nbsp; (The Daily Star also details Dr. Galib’s Pakistani &amp; 
	Saudi contacts).&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How ardent was the 
	patronizing before the “arrests”? As an example of the level of government 
	support for the Islamists, Prof Abu Sayed the ex-Information Minister, had 
	had a press conference on his new book “Ogoshito Juddher’s Blueprint” 
	(“Blueprint for the Undeclared War”)&nbsp; that outlines the Jamaat Party long 
	term plans on the basis of their party literature.&nbsp; What does the government 
	do? The very next day the police raided the author’s house and confiscated 
	all the books.&nbsp; (A public death threat against the publishing house followed 
	which went like: “We who want Islamic Revolution are not cowards and 
	therefore we announce ahead of time that the owner will be killed and the 
	Osmani publishing house will be wiped off the face off the earth….”)</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Admissions of 
	Complicity</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So why the sudden 
	turn around? &nbsp;It was pressure by EU on all donor nations - who would have 
	thought?&nbsp; One could see the progression of the moves by EU in the daily news 
	reports - there is nothing hidden or inferred on this matter. I will spare 
	the reader the details that are amply available in the newspapers of 
	February.&nbsp; Suffice to say that on Feb 24<sup>th</sup> miraculously the 
	police found the bomb making materials, grenades etc which they couldn’t 
	find all these years. All indications however are that this “crackdown” is a 
	show for the benefit of the donor countries and that the Islamists will be 
	released ASAP.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nonetheless, the 
	Islamic parties have expressed their dissatisfaction on the “crackdown” and 
	one of their leaders declared “There is a conspiracy to prevent Islamic 
	Revolution in the name of taming the militants, but the conspirators will 
	not succeed.” (Feb 26<sup>th</sup> Daily Star).</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>The Political 
	Opposition</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is hard to 
	believe that the AL actually wants to combat fundamentalism – its rhetoric 
	seem to be merely a stick to beat the BNP with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many suggest that the AL 
	membership has been infiltrated by Islamists from the early days of their 
	colluding together.&nbsp; Certainly the AL does not seem able to go beyond 
	rhetoric against the government.&nbsp; It is widely seen as having missed 
	opportunities to mobilize the public effectively. For example, tensions were 
	high in Dhaka after the August 21<sup>st</sup> grenade attack: for some days 
	the govt was in fear of what people’s wrath would lead to. In principle the 
	opposition should have been able to utilize that anger towards its avowed 
	goal of toppling the government.&nbsp; But - nothing happened. There was no 
	Ukraine.&nbsp; There were only the same calls for hartals, not for 
	demonstrations.&nbsp; Hartals keep people indoors, a convenient situation for the 
	government when tensions are as high as after the August 21<sup>st</sup> 
	grenade attack in Dhaka. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>The People</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most do not 
	support the Islamists. They see the Islamic groups as organized and 
	efficient - and as something to be afraid of. &nbsp;Bangladesh has historically 
	been secular, in the sense that people accept religion as a personal choice 
	and not something to be imposed by the state.&nbsp; People also remember the 
	genocide done in the name of religion in 1971, and of the participation by 
	the Jamaat and other religious groups in the killings, rape and torture of 
	1971, the violence in the universities by the student wings of the last two 
	decades, the attacks on minorities and the assassinations. &nbsp;People see the 
	Islamists not practicing Islam but something else, an intolerance of 
	viewpoints other than their own (which is really a political tool). Their 
	use of violence and terror is because they can not convince people by 
	reason, because precisely they have none.&nbsp; Nonetheless, they have 
	“strategy”; they are clever in portraying themselves opposed to “Western 
	values”, as their bombing of&nbsp; Valentine Day debate underline, and as the 
	alternative to the main parties, one that is less corrupt and can ensure 
	stability (after they themselves introduce sufficient instability!).&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There has been and 
	continue to be attempts by people outside of the political parties to 
	organize.&nbsp; Most notable may be the “Oikko Boddho Gono Andolon” (Citizen’s 
	Movement) that came to a head in 2000 and again in 2004. It was composed of 
	people from all walks of life – workers, students, lawyers, doctors, 
	farmers, rickshaw pullers – and in April 2004 massed 200,000 people in 
	Dhaka.&nbsp; They however have been an easy target for the government, and they 
	have not been welcomed by the political opposition, because such a people’s 
	movement represents a true and democratic opposition.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Other longer term 
	civil society bodies that are active include some cultural groups like 
	Udichi and the Nirmul Committee, originally initiated by Jahanara Imam to 
	expose 1971 war collaborators.&nbsp; Volunteers come together in a small office 
	room in Mohakali, and they have a good network that reaches many remote 
	parts of Bangladesh.&nbsp; They help in the rehabilitation of veterans and 
	families of freedom fighters killed in the war, some of whom are reduced to 
	abject poverty today.&nbsp; For some wives of the martyred freedom fighters 
	working as maids in houses is seen as a good fortune. Nirmul Committee 
	members regularly travel to remote areas to be in contact with such families 
	and their supporters – in fact the most recent attack on Shariar Kabir’s 
	life – reported as an “accident” - was when he and others were on a trip to 
	assist some of the ‘71 widows. (Everybody in the car was badly injured, and 
	one activist died of his injuries.&nbsp; The deceased, &nbsp;Pial, &nbsp;&nbsp;left a three 
	month old daughter; there is a fund raising effort to help his family).&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Nirmul 
	Committee has a long term perspective and has been trying to salvage our 
	history and tolerant culture.&nbsp; They have been instrumental in establishing 
	libraries in 40 upozillas and plan on a total of 500. These libraries 
	counter the pull of the madrashas by providing much needed meeting space for 
	young people who otherwise have no options for recreation (virtually no 
	playgrounds, no scope for sports, or even to meet and discuss issues).&nbsp; They 
	have general secular reading material and are staffed by local youth and 
	respected elders. &nbsp;To maintain these libraries is a long term struggle.&nbsp; 
	There has been one case where the library was ransacked, books hacked to 
	pieces and thrown in the river. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>Has anybody 
	seen the film by Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine “Life of Averroes” 
	or “Destiny”?&nbsp; Caliph Al Mansur in Cordoba under the influence of 
	fundamentalists ordered all of the philosopher's books burned. This was the 
	struggle in which Islam was being forced away from the tolerant enlightened 
	religion that it was. The film is a light and a serious work and if you see 
	it you will never forget it.</i>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During my stay I 
	visited one library in Dhaka’s Mirpur area, which has been threatened but is 
	ably protected by the greater strength of the ‘parar chelye’ (“boys of the 
	neighborhood’).&nbsp; The library was no more than a small rented room in a 
	house. Alhmiras stacked with books lined the room, the only other furniture 
	being one long table with wooden chairs.&nbsp; That is all. Yet, everybody wanted 
	to talk, everybody was thrilled to have a well-wisher visit. The energy of 
	the young people there far outshone the modesty of the surroundings.&nbsp; I felt 
	those young people - brave hearts and open minds - are the reason for hope 
	in Bangladesh.&nbsp; For expatriates such as us, there is a choice - &nbsp;we can get 
	to know and perhaps help such people, or we can stand aloof and let them 
	resist alone the brute force that seek to imprison mind and country.&nbsp;</font></p>
