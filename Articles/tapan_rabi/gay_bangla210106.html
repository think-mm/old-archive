	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">They will forgive me if I commit a 
	murder but not if they find out that I have a boy friend.&quot; Mohsin is 28 
	years old, a Bangladeshi, and a gay. He was speculating on the possible 
	reaction of his upper middle class family members if they were to discover 
	his sexual preference. Having graduated two years ago, Mohsin has landed a 
	decent job in a development outfit and knows his mother will push for his 
	marriage as soon as his youngest sister ties the knot. He is terrified of 
	that moment. He plans not to tell his family, and not to marry either. Is he 
	overreacting? There has been a number of cases where the family has accepted 
	the same sex proclivity of their sons, and even daughters. While family 
	dinners with same sex partners are still not in, children are not thrown out 
	if they are revealed to be homosexuals. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But there certainly are difficulties 
	when homosexuals first declare their preference, known as &quot;coming out&quot; in 
	gay parlance. Most families respond with dismay and a kind of corporate 
	shame. Many feel that they have gone wrong somewhere in the child's 
	upbringing. Since some gay activists in Bangladesh are very highly educated, 
	once in a while, foreign education is cited as a reason for being gay. In 
	fact, Bangladeshis are very active on the global gay scene. But those still 
	in the closet oscillate between confusion, guilt and fear. &quot;Why do they hate 
	us?&quot; asks a gay man in Dhaka. &quot;Except for preferring people of the same sex 
	as partners we have done nothing wrong.&quot; Being gay in Bangladesh isn't easy 
	because society responds differently to sexuality in public and in private. 
	To put it bluntly, society is hypocritical, for it says one thing and does 
	another. People involved with gay issues say that between 5 to 10 percent of 
	the population is homosexual. That would mean at least 6 to 12 million 
	Bangladeshis, more than the total population of many countries, prefer the 
	same sex. Even if that estimate is considered to be on the higher side and 
	is reduced by half, the number left would still be significant. But almost 
	no discussion can take place on the subject, even with the threat of 
	HIV/AIDS looming over Bangladeshis and gays being identified as one of the 
	most vulnerable groups. Criminal Behaviour One of the reasons that 
	homosexuality is treated so gingerly is that the country's Criminal Code 
	decrees sodomy (homosexuality or advocacy of the same) a crime which is 
	punishable with a jail sentence. Any discussion, not to speak of debate, is 
	hence ruled out and homosexuality is driven into the shadow world. 
	Demonstration of homosexual tendencies for short periods is quite common in 
	Bangladeshi society. Those practising it are not ostracised, although if 
	caught, are ridiculed. Like in other societies, gay relationships flourish 
	in dormitories, barracks, labour colonies and hostels, and authorities are 
	hard pressed to keep them a secret. In the Dhaka University dorms, cases of 
	young boys being kept as &quot;regulars&quot; are well known. Male prostitutes are 
	available in most towns. And in rural areas, homosexuality is generally 
	considered something that young people do for fun and some elders may do in 
	secret. Male homosexuality is tolerated despite religious sanction. Yet 
	divorce citing gay behaviour by any partner is not known. It is a different 
	story for lesbians, however. Although it is no secret that dormitories 
	record incidences of lesbianism and studies have corroborated the fact, it 
	is kept a secret fearing loss of marriage prospects. And marriage, after 
	all, is society's idea of a woman's ultimate nirvana. Literature has 
	recorded a high incidence of shakhi culture, where proximate friendship 
	develops between two women in which emotions are at least romantic and may 
	lapse into &quot;touching&quot;, though both parties may deny any sexual overtones in 
	such relationships. Psychologists say many shakhis may be substitutes for 
	boyfriends. Society frowns upon single women, and the social pressure to 
	marry- doesn't matter who to-is intense. Most succumb to it, despite their 
	sexual preferences, and end up miserably knotted. Heterosexual girls suffer 
	in marriages with male gays too. &quot;I can't run away from my responsibilities. 
	I have a family. So I stay although we are like strangers at home,&quot; says 
	Sultana, a 30-plus housewife married to a gay. Many gays, forced into 
	marriage, often resort to clandestine and then increasingly open gay 
	relationships, leaving women with a dead marriage to have and to hold. 
	Children, economic dependence and &quot;shame&quot; prevents any divorce actions. 
	There are some instances of lesbians entering permanent relationships, but 
	most lesbians are married and whatever sexual liaisons they may enter into 
	are purely by chance. &quot;I have had sex with a woman only once in my life,&quot; 
	says Zaheda, who works for a travel agency and lives with her disabled 
	sister. The tolerance level for lesbians is very low in Bengali society. It 
	is low for women in general. One either worships them (mother models) or 
	abuses them (partners). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">West Bengal The situation is 
	somewhat different in Bengali society across the border in India. At the 
	elite level, there is considerable acceptance of homosexuality and of gay 
	groups. Homosexuals keep in touch with each other through magazines like 
	Provortak (published from Calcutta) or through gay organisations. Some 
	activists in Calcutta are directly involved in running sexual health 
	projects jointly with official agencies. Although India also has the same 
	laws relating to sodomy, gays are not prosecuted. A petition for scrapping 
	the sodomy laws is awaiting action at the Supreme Court in New Delhi. A 
	number of organisations like the Humsafar Foundation have been working for 
	wider acceptance of gays in Indian society with some degree of success. In 
	West Bengal, there have been occasional instances of harassment, but gays 
	can operate with relative openness. Gay prostitution is high, operating out 
	of parks and other public places. Some Calcutta lesbians, many of them 
	married, have set up private clubs which are basically places to get 
	together. But the stigma of female homosexuality remains strong in West 
	Bengal as well, even though the pages of Provortak are full of pieces by 
	lesbians discussing their problems. In Bangladesh, it looks as if the sodomy 
	laws will remain in the books for some time to come, not a little because of 
	religious opposition. Whatever society may do in private, publicly they want 
	respectable laws. In India, social attitudes are more liberal and relaxed, 
	which allows gays to &quot;come out&quot; and access health and other services more 
	easily. Meanwhile, the least that the authorities could do is wake up to the 
	reality of gay behaviour and recognise that health and social issues are 
	becoming more and more pressing where homosexuals are concerned. 
	Homosexuality does not disappear by ignoring it. Some Middle Eastern 
	societies have adopted a pragmatic approach by maintaining that because 
	homosexuality is a crime committed against God, the matter should be dealt 
	by Him on Judgement Day. Perhaps this interpretation should be used to 
	provide Bengali gays with some respite as well, if not in society at large, 
	at least in law? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There are gays in every society, 
	including Bengali society, and there is no sense in suppressing and stifling 
	homosexuality.</font></p>
