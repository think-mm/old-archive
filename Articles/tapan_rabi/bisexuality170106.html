	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Numerous works from the early 
    twentieth century revolve around the notion of a 'true' identity, one that 
    is either hetero- or homosexual. Although both E. M. Forster's Maurice 
    (written 1914) and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness (1928) portray 
    characters who appear bisexual, they are not allowed to occupy that 'in 
    between' space without derision. Both novels attempt to portray the 
    naturalness of homosexual desire (in obvious response to the discourses of 
    medicine and psychology that argued the opposite), but they do so by casting 
    the bisexual as untrue to himself or herself, unwilling to take the brave 
    step of acknowledging a fundamental homosexual identity. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus Clive in Maurice and Mary in The 
  Well of Loneliness are portrayed as cowards, doomed to unhappiness because of 
  their equivocation. Individuals who historically would have been celebrated 
  for their ability to respond to both sexes came to be considered the truly 
  unnatural ones, out-of-place and inconvenient in a literary and social war 
  between homosexuals and their heterosexual oppressors. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This is not to say that bisexuality 
  disappeared completely in terms of writers' lived experiences. Virginia Woolf 
  was clearly bisexual, as was the imagist poet H.D. (Hilda Doolittle). But even 
  Woolf, who explores gender transgression in such radical ways in Orlando 
  (1928) (whose hero/heroine changes biological sex), never celebrates 
  bisexuality in her works as a unified identity. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At best, bisexuality is present in 
  early twentieth-century, Anglo- American literature as a tortured, tense 
  state, such as that indicated in many of D. H. Lawrence's novels, where 
  emotional commitments to both sexes are possible only if expressions of 
  physical intimacy between members of the same sex are severely limited. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even more typical of the middle years 
  of the century is the representation of bisexuality in Evelyn Waugh's 
  Brideshead Revisited (1945); though possibly bisexual himself, Waugh portrays 
  it as a phase through which, at best, one passes on the way to a firm identity 
  (which in the case of Brideshead means a healthy heterosexuality and 
  pathological homosexuality). The same idea is echoed later in James Baldwin's 
  Giovanni's Room (1956), where bisexuality is portrayed as a phase that, if not 
  moved beyond, becomes unstable and leads to personal disaster. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But the rich complexity of human 
  emotional response and the diversity of human desires cannot be so easily 
  suppressed and dismissed. Gore Vidal, in his afterward to The City and the 
  Pillar (1948), reclaims bisexuality as the most 'natural' human state. </font>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So too did the French novelist 
  Colette, who both in her life and literary works celebrated bisexual 
  eroticism. In the &quot;Claudine&quot; novels and later works, Colette portrays the many 
  quandaries faced by a woman attracted to members of both sexes, ones that 
  Colette herself encountered in her marriages to men and affairs with other 
  women. Colette's novels from the early part of the twentieth century 
  anticipate the portrayals of relatively healthy bisexuality that would only 
  become common many decades later, after the gay and lesbian rights movements 
  had gained a sense of legitimacy and rigid rules for self-identification began 
  to erode. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the years since the 1969 Stonewall 
  uprising and the publication of the Kinsey sex surveys (in which bisexual 
  activity was found to be very common), many more positive and complex 
  portrayals of bisexuality have appeared in print. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ursula K. Le Guin's celebrated science 
  fiction novel The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) remains a remarkable 
  exploration of sexual diversity, describing an alien people who can change 
  biological sex as reproductive cycles demand. They have the natural, innate 
  potential to respond to each other with enormous sexual freedom. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly utopian in its vision of 
  future erotic liberation is Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time (1976), 
  which portrays a human society in which bisexuality is the norm and where 
  narrow gender roles and definitions of sexual orientation have been abandoned 
  as unnecessary historical constructs. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bisexuality also plays a key part in 
  the protagonist's growth toward fulfillment in Alice Walker's celebrated novel 
  The Color Purple (1982), where erotic bonding between women is shown not only 
  to be compatible with heterosexual desires, but even necessary for women's 
  political strength and security. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lastly, important nonfictional 
  discussions of bisexuality appear in the works of the French feminist theorist 
  Hélène Cixous and those of the American literary and cultural critic Kate 
  Millett, both of whom decry the oppressiveness of binary constructions of 
  identity. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Numerous works by male writers of the 
  mid- to late-twentieth century are equally 'bi-positive'. Paul Bowles's short 
  stories, set in North Africa, explore the relative freedom allowed for 
  bisexual men by some modern Arab cultures, even as they dramatize the harsh 
  and unrelenting sexism of the same societies. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A similar double-standard is explored 
  in Norman Mailer's Ancient Evenings (1983), which brings to life Egypt during 
  the reign of the pharaohs and takes as one of its basic assumptions the 
  bisexuality of its male characters. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tom Spanbauer's The Man Who Fell in 
  Love With the Moon (1991) explores bisexuality in yet another non-Western 
  culture, that of the Native Americans; this first-person narrative is told 
  from the perspective of a berdache, a biologically male, though transgendered, 
  individual whose sexual ambiguity meets with relentless hostility from 
  conservative Christian settlers on the American frontier. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And finally, similar internal and 
  external tensions confront bisexual characters in the works of David Leavitt 
  and the poet Gavin Dillard, both of whom portray bisexuality as a natural 
  state for some people, even as social and interrelational forces continue to 
  urge, and sometimes force, individuals to choose between hetero- and 
  homosexual identities. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But at the very least, the discourse 
  on sexuality has rewidened since the mid-twentieth century so that validation 
  for bisexuals is no longer impossible to locate in literature and social 
  movements. Conceptualizations in the 1990s of a broad notion of a &quot;queer&quot; 
  identity, one that embraces gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgendered 
  individuals, and even transgressive heterosexuals, have been welcomed by many 
  in the subsumed communities, even as others have resisted any revision in the 
  narrower, binarized notions of identity that have proved to be politically 
  efficacious in the past. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But simplistic designations of all 
  human beings as fundamentally heterosexual or homosexual are clearly as 
  oppressive toward some people as institutionalized homophobia has been toward 
  gays and lesbians. Whether or not bisexuality is a natural state for all women 
  and men, it is certainly so for some, as history and literature repeatedly 
  bears out. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And in recognizing the unique 
  interests of the bisexual community, as well as the numerous ways such 
  interests intersect with those of the gay and lesbian communities, we can come 
  to a better understanding of social history and the rich heritage of literary 
  traditions and representations that counter heterosexism and challenge the 
  narrow, tradition-bound, and oppressive categories through which society 
  identifies and thereby judges people. </font></p>

  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">WHAT IS BISEXUALITY? </font></b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many people are 100% gay or lesbian, 
  and are drawn sexually and emotionally only to partners of the same sex. 
  Others are completely heterosexual, bonding in sexual and intimate 
  relationships only with people of another sex. But what about everybody else? 
  A significant percentage of people do not fit neatly into either of these 
  categories, because they experience sexual and emotional attractions and 
  feelings for people of different genders at some point during their lives. For 
  lack of a better term, they are called bisexuals, although many people prefer 
  to call themselves &quot;pansexual,&quot; &quot;non- preferential,&quot; &quot;sexually fluid,&quot; &quot;ambisexual,&quot; 
  or &quot;omni-sexual.&quot; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Kinsey scale of zero to six was 
  developed by sex researchers to describe sexual orientation as a continuum. 
  Heterosexual people are at zero on the scale, gay and Lesbian people are at 
  six at the other end of the scale, and everyone in between, from one to five, 
  is bisexual. People who fall at one or two on the scale have primarily 
  heterosexual sexual and affectional relationships and desires, but have some 
  attraction and experiences with same -sex partners as well. People at three on 
  the scale are approximately equally attracted to both men and women. People at 
  four and five on the Kinsey scale choose primarily same-sex partners, but are 
  not completely gay or lesbian and have some heterosexual tendencies and 
  relationships as well. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">WHO IS BISEXUAL? </font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As you can see, there is no simple 
  definition of bisexuality, and bisexual people are a very diverse group. There 
  are several theories about different models of bisexual behavior. J. R. Little 
  identifies at least 13 types of bisexuality, as defined by sexual desires and 
  experiences. They are: </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Alternating bisexuals: may have a 
  relationship with a man, and then after that relationship ends, may choose a 
  female partner for a subsequent relationship, and many go back to a male 
  partner next. Circumstantial bisexuals: primarily heterosexual, but will 
  choose same sex partners only in situations where they have no access to 
  other-sex partners, such as when in jail, in the military, or in a 
  gender-segregated school. Concurrent relationship bisexuals: have primary 
  relationship with one gender only but have other casual or secondary 
  relationships with people of another gender at the same time. Conditional 
  bisexuals: either straight or gay/lesbian, but will switch to a relationship 
  with another gender for financial or career gain or for a specific purpose, 
  such as young straight males who become gay prostitutes or lesbians who get 
  married to men in order to gain acceptance from family members or to have 
  children. Emotional bisexuals: have intimate emotional relationships with both 
  men and women, but only have sexual relationships with one gender. Integrated 
  bisexuals: have more than one primary relationship at the same time, one with 
  a man and one with a woman. Exploratory bisexuals: either straight or 
  gay/lesbian, but have sex with another gender just to satisfy curiosity or 
  &quot;see what it's like.&quot; Hedonistic bisexuals: primarily straight or gay/lesbian 
  but will sometimes have sex with another gender primarily for fun or purely 
  sexual satisfaction. Recreational bisexuals: primarily heterosexual but engage 
  in gay or lesbian sex only when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. 
  Isolated bisexuals: 100% straight or gay/lesbian now but has had at one or 
  more sexual experience with another gender in the past. Latent bisexuals: 
  completely straight or gay lesbian in behavior but have strong desire for sex 
  with another gender, but have never acted on it. Motivational bisexuals: 
  straight women who have sex with other women only because a male partner 
  insists on it to titillate him. Transitional bisexuals: temporarily identify 
  as bisexual while in the process of moving from being straight to being gay or 
  lesbian, or going from being gay or lesbian to being heterosexual. Many of 
  these people might not call themselves bisexual, but because they are 
  attracted to and have relationships with both men and women, they are in fact 
  bisexual. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While literally millions of people are 
  bisexual, most keep their sexual orientation secret, so bisexual people as a 
  group are nearly invisible in society. Gay men and lesbian women have long 
  recognized the need to join together, create community, and to organize 
  politically. Long years of hard work have led to significant gains in 
  political and human rights, as well as a visible and thriving gay and lesbian 
  community. Bisexual people have been much slower to come out of the closet, 
  create community, and form political and social networks to gain visibility 
  and political clout. Many bisexual people have spent decades working in gay 
  and lesbian organizations, and in recent years, bisexuals have become more 
  accepted as part of the Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender community. However, 
  the rigid dichotomy between gay and straight has caused many bisexuals to feel 
  alienated and rejected by gay men and lesbian women, and in recent years many 
  independent bisexual political and social groups have sprung up. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many bisexual people complain that 
  they feel like outsiders in both the straight and gay/lesbian worlds, and that 
  they can't fit in anywhere, feeling isolated and confused. Studies have shown 
  that bisexual people suffer from social isolation even more than gay men or 
  lesbians because they lack any community where they can find acceptance and 
  role models. Many gay men feel that bisexual men are really gay, that they are 
  just in denial about being Gay, and that they should &quot;just get over it.&quot; Many 
  straight men are homophobic and hate and fear both bisexual and gay men, often 
  victimizing them with harassment and physical violence. Many straight women 
  reject bisexual men out of misguided fears that they have AIDS, and admonish 
  them to &quot;stop sitting on the fence and make up their minds.&quot; Bisexual women 
  are often distrusted by lesbians for &quot;sleeping with the enemy,&quot; hanging onto 
  heterosexual privileges through relationships with men, and betraying their 
  allegiance to women and feminism. Straight women often reject bisexual women 
  out of fear they will make sexual overtures and try to &quot;convert&quot; them to being 
  bisexual. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Both the straight and gay/lesbian 
  communities seem to have only two possible models of bisexuality, neither of 
  which represents bisexual people accurately. The first is the &quot;transitional 
  model&quot; of bisexuality, believing that all bisexuals are actually gay or 
  lesbian but are just on the way to eventually coming out as gay. The other is 
  the &quot;pathological model&quot;, that bisexuals are neurotic or mentally unstable 
  because they are in conflict trying to decide whether they are straight or 
  gay/lesbian, and that they just can't make a decision. Both models see 
  bisexuality as a temporary experience or a &quot;phase&quot; born out of confusion 
  rather than an authentic sexual orientation equally as valid as 
  heterosexuality or homosexuality. Some people see bisexuality as inherently 
  subversive because it blurs the boundaries, confronting both heterosexuals and 
  gay men and lesbian women with sexual ambiguity. As a result, bisexuality 
  challenges concepts of sexuality, traditional relationship and family 
  structures, monogamy, gender, and identity. Bisexuals cannot conform to the 
  ethics of either the gay or straight world or they would not be bisexual. 
  Instead they must re-invent personal ethics and values for themselves, and 
  create responsible lifestyles and relationships that serve their needs even 
  though they don't fit anyone else's rules. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some researchers have note that being 
  bisexual is in some ways similar to being bi-racial. Mixed-race persons 
  generally don't feel comfortable or accepted by people of either ethnic group, 
  feeling that they don't belong or fit in anywhere, as their existence 
  challenges the very concept of race. Like bisexual people, they spend most of 
  their lives moving between two communities that don't really understand or 
  accept them. Like biracial people, bisexual people must struggle to invent 
  their own identities to correspond to their own experience. Forming a bisexual 
  identity helps bisexual people to structure, to make sense of , and to give 
  meaning and definition to their reality. </font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">STAGES OF BISEXUAL IDENTITY </font>
  </b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For most bisexuals, there are at least 
  four steps or stages to fully acknowledging and becoming comfortable with 
  their identities as bisexuals. Confusion over sexual orientation. Most 
  bisexual people start out feeling very confused about their attraction towards 
  people of both sexes, questioning their own reality, and wondering &quot;Is 
  something wrong with me/&quot;Some spend their entire lives in this stage, hiding 
  their sexual orientation, feeling isolated and alone with the inner turmoil 
  over their &quot;dual attractions. Many go through life identifying as straight or 
  gay/lesbian in order to be accepted and make sense of their sexual 
  orientation. Because their own experience does not conform to either 
  community, they feel intense external pressure to choose one and identify with 
  it. Without any language to frame their own reality, and no visible role 
  models or community available to them, bisexual people must have sufficient 
  self-confidence and belief in their own identity in order to eventually 
  transcend this stage. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Discovery of the bisexual label and 
  choosing to identify as bisexual. Almost all bisexual people acknowledge that 
  discovering the label &quot;bisexual&quot; was pivotal in understanding and accepting 
  their sexual orientation. Most experience extreme relief when they hear the 
  word &quot;bisexual&quot; for the first time, because they finally have a word that 
  mirrors their experience and feelings. For some, the negative stereotypes of 
  bisexuals as &quot;promiscuous&quot; &quot;fence sitters,&quot; neurotic, or vectors of AIDS 
  prevent them from identifying with the label or claiming it for themselves, 
  but most agree that it comes closer than any other language to describing 
  their lives. Instead of rejecting the label, many bisexuals invent their own 
  definition and create bisexual lifestyles that fit their individual lives.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Settling into and maintaining a 
  bisexual identity. For many bisexual people, this step is the most difficult. 
  Intellectually, they feel good about being bisexual, but emotionally, they 
  experience extreme conflict living in the real world as bisexual. Often 
  scorned by family and friends and rejected by spouses or potential partners 
  for being bisexual, they find that to develop and maintain a bisexual identity 
  requires inner strength, self- reliance, confidence, and independence. Many 
  overcome these obstacles by forming their own community, finding accepting 
  friends and lovers, and staying out of the closet despite the consequences.
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Transforming adversity. For most 
  bisexuals, coming out and staying out of the closet is an on- going process 
  which must be repeated with every new social situation, workplace, friend, and 
  lover. Many see this process as the most important form of political action, 
  creating visible role models and a cohesive bisexual community. Because most 
  bisexuals have suffered through the first three stages alone and in silence, 
  they want to make it easier for other bisexuals to recognize and embrace their 
  sexual orientation without years of inner turmoil and loneliness. Many also 
  get involved in bisexual political organizations as a way to increase bisexual 
  visibility and promote bisexuality as a viable identity. Just as gay men and 
  lesbians were only able to win some rights through fighting in both the social 
  and political arenas, bisexuals will only win political and human rights 
  through coming out of the closet and developing political clout. WHAT DOES 
  THIS MEAN FOR YOU? Does any of this sound familiar? Are you struggling with

  one of the many bisexual and questioning support groups listed on the back of 
  this pamphlet, to find a safe place to express your feelings and meet others 
  who are going through similar experiences. One to one counseling or therapy 
  can also be helpful in sorting out feelings and gaining clarity and 
  self-confidence. Be careful to seek out a non-judgmental therapist who is 
  supportive of bisexuality and has expertise in bisexual issues. And joining 
  bisexual social or political groups is also a great way to see visible role 
  models and to allow your bisexual identity to evolve in a way that fits you. 
  and last, but certainly not least, there are now many excellent books on 
  bisexuality which may help you understand and fully embrace your sexual 
  orientation. </font></p>
