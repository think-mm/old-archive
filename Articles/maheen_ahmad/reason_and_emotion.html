	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">Emotion plays more of a role in guiding 
	moral decisions pertaining to treatment of others than reason.&nbsp; Our 
	treatment of other people is classified as moral or immoral based on how we 
	make the other feel.&nbsp; It is our empathy that guides our decision of how to 
	treat people.&nbsp; Because human emotions and feelings are universal, the code 
	of ethics is derived mostly from instinct.&nbsp; The golden rule – do to others 
	as you would do to yourself – illustrates how moral decisions are guided 
	based on equality and giving people a chance to pursue peace and happiness.&nbsp; 
	Even if a decision had a very reasonable or progressive justification for 
	it, we would be hesitant to support it if it made us feel uneasy.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">One example where this can be illustrated, 
	in the area of science, is the exploitation of our predictions based on 
	evolution.&nbsp; The idea of natural selection in the theory of evolution is that 
	in a competition for survival, organisms with less advantageous traits die, 
	and the fitter survive.&nbsp; When applied to genetics, it means that harmful or 
	less beneficial genes are weeded out so that future populations have the 
	better, improved genotypes.&nbsp; In a biological perspective, every individual’s 
	goal is to better their species by keeping it alive through reproduction and 
	producing healthy offspring that will carry on their beneficial genes to the 
	next generation.&nbsp; However, a twist in this natural process has occurred with 
	scientific developments in medicine, technology, and treatment, for 
	sustaining those with health problems, keeping them alive to pass on their 
	flawed genes to future generations.&nbsp; This is unreasonable according to 
	evolution, because it defeats the natural purpose of strengthening a 
	species.&nbsp; It would be reasonable rather, not to keep people with harmful 
	genes alive so as to eliminate them from the gene pool.&nbsp; However, such a 
	perspective has not been deemed as ethical because it does not agree with 
	people’s emotional instincts.&nbsp; If there was someone who loved his sister, 
	and she had diabetes, he would most likely not be satisfied with the 
	explanation that her death contributes to a greater biological cause, but 
	rather be distressed over his loss because of the emotional attachment he 
	had with her.&nbsp; This is the perspective most people consider when deciding 
	what is wrong.&nbsp; Because it is human nature to be capable of these same 
	emotions, it is generally agreed that it is not a moral decision to let 
	someone die despite any biological consequences.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">However, a reasonable argument is 
	available for the same purpose.&nbsp; Although an individual may carry a lethal 
	gene, he/she may also carry a beneficial gene to pass on.&nbsp; In fact, the gene 
	may be beneficial in the long-run.&nbsp; Simultaneously, a supposedly healthy 
	individual could carry a harmful recessive gene or a lethal gene that, if 
	producing offspring homozygous for that gene, cause harmful effects.&nbsp; Thus, 
	we can always eliminate the good at the same time we eliminate the bad.&nbsp; 
	Conversely, by keeping alive certain traits we could be sustaining harmful 
	traits.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">Another example that shows how emotion 
	prevails in justifying moral decisions more than reason is considering 
	Stalin’s reason for subordinating the rights and happiness of his people to 
	the cause of the state.&nbsp; His first Five-Year-Plan consisted of the goal to 
	rapidly industrialize Russia to the same extent it took Great Britain to 
	develop in a greater period of time.&nbsp; In order to do this he collectivized 
	the peasants in order to produce enough to help the state economy.&nbsp; However, 
	the demands of the program were so great that the peasants could not afford 
	to feed themselves.&nbsp; When they revolted, Stalin was outraged at their threat 
	to counter his progressive efforts, and eliminated them through exile and 
	killings.&nbsp; Here, Stalin had an essentially valid reason for his actions.&nbsp; 
	However, no individual person could be content under the circumstances 
	imposed by the state.&nbsp; Although Stalin tried to help the economy in general, 
	he lacked the human understanding to consider his implications on the 
	state’s people’s well-being.&nbsp; This is why Stalin’s actions are classified as 
	immoral, despite his progressive intentions for the state.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">Also, while human empathy is the basis for 
	many moral decisions, we must consider our moral interactions with other 
	species.&nbsp; Do animals deserve the same treatment as do humans, or is there 
	justification for us to consider them inferior to humans?&nbsp; It is generally 
	accepted that our basis for treating people equally is that we are all 
	equally capable of the same feelings, emotions, and instincts.&nbsp; However, do 
	animals feel the same way as humans do?&nbsp; General observations suggest that 
	most species of animals do not harbor complex emotions, such as loyalty.&nbsp; 
	Most human individuals, on the other hand, tend to feel that they deserve 
	loyalty from their romantic partner or spouse, where it is wrong for the 
	partner to commit adultery or have multiple partners.&nbsp; However, in the 
	animal community, most species (with the exception of some) choose multiple 
	mates that are able to produce a variety of healthy offspring.&nbsp; Also, the 
	study of the feral children showed that when there was danger, each child 
	looked after themselves but did not seem to consider the well-being of 
	others.&nbsp; Although animals can work collectively to sustain themselves, they 
	do so innately and unconsciously, while humans are conscious of their 
	interactions with others.&nbsp; Animals do seem to be capable of feeling physical 
	pain to the same extent as humans, so it should be wrong to torture them 
	physically.&nbsp; But is eating animal meat as offensive as killing and consuming 
	one of our fellow human beings?&nbsp; The arguments against the killing of 
	animals for consumption made by vegetarians and vegans are derived from an 
	emotional regard to the animals, because they apply the same empathy they 
	have for humans towards animals.&nbsp; On the other hand, the people who justify 
	the consumption of other animals by claiming that it is an essential 
	component of the food chain and that animals have the simpler, less 
	purposeful lifestyle appeal to reason.&nbsp; Thus, in the case of animal rights, 
	there is no prevalence of reason or emotion in determining the ground moral 
	rules for treating other species.&nbsp; This shows we do not feel the same extent 
	of empathy towards them as we do to members of our own species.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">While there are basic instincts that are 
	generally shared among the human race, despite location or culture, there 
	are morals that differ according to specific groups of people.&nbsp; The 
	cultures’ traditional morals may contradict one another and the universal 
	golden rule discussed previously.&nbsp; Moral relativism states that there are no 
	universal values, and that cultures define their own.&nbsp; Thus, no one has the 
	right to judge another group’s values because they would just be asserting 
	their own paradigms on others.&nbsp; However, a contradiction occurs when stating 
	that all cultures should be tolerant of other cultures’ moral values.&nbsp; If 
	one group’s moral values assert that it is appropriate to not tolerate 
	another group’s moral code but stress theirs instead, the previous statement 
	contradicts itself.&nbsp; But moral decisions based on human empathy must be 
	reemphasized.&nbsp; Different religions or cultures have contradicting rules 
	concerning the consumption of pork or alcohol, but there are core values 
	concerning the treatment of others prevalent in most cultures.&nbsp; Most 
	societies prefer to live at peace and contain some sense of unity or 
	cooperation.&nbsp; Thus, the golden rule is common to most cultures.&nbsp; Needless 
	murder and torture of innocent people is usually checked.&nbsp; However, we have 
	heard of people inflicting “inhumane” treatment upon other, well, humans.&nbsp; 
	Some groups do not enforce their own moral code upon external groups.&nbsp; 
	Current examples include the genocide in Darfur, in addition to numerous 
	genocides in other regions of Africa, and Abu Ghraib where Iraqi soldiers 
	and civilians were tortured.&nbsp; Historical examples include the Holocaust of 
	the Jews by the German Nazis, as well as slavery.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">Lack of empathy is most to blame for these 
	occurrences.&nbsp; This lack of empathy usually occurs between different groups 
	of people divided by race, language, religious beliefs, or gender.&nbsp; What 
	inhibits one group’s empathy for another?&nbsp; When their differences prevent 
	them from relating to the other party, not understanding they are capable of 
	the same feelings and emotions.&nbsp; Even within the same group, subjugation of 
	women is caused by the inability of the other gender to realize that women 
	and men have more similar characteristics than their physical attributes 
	imply.&nbsp; Women are physically weaker than men, which forms the assumption 
	that they are so mentally as well.&nbsp; Inhumanities and conflict occur between 
	different groups of people.&nbsp; For example, &nbsp;Schulman, a psychologist who 
	works with juvenile delinquents, described that the adolescents expressed 
	outrage at someone mugging an elderly lady, but felt that it was okay to mug 
	“a Chinese delivery guy”&nbsp; (Kluger, J., “What Makes Us Moral”, <i>Time,</i> 
	December 3, 2007. p. 60.).&nbsp; To mug the old lady was an offense because “that 
	could be my grandmother.” “The old lady is someone they could empathize 
	with”, explains Schulman.&nbsp; “The Chinese delivery guy is alien, literally and 
	figuratively, to them.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">This further explains the reason why when 
	the Europeans first landed in the Americas, they did not feel the need to 
	extend their civil rights to the Native Americans, whom they thought of as 
	sub-human.&nbsp; Similarly, it took quite awhile for the general American 
	population to see the racially different African descendents as equal, at 
	first enslaving them and then segregating them from facilities for white 
	people.&nbsp; It is when we get to know each other personally – which can be 
	difficult with language barriers – when we realize that we are all capable 
	of the same emotions. &nbsp;</span></p>
