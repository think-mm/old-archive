						<p class="RTE" align="justify">
						<font face="Verdana" size="2">Ms. Farida Banu, younger 
						sister of Dhaka University teacher Mr. Giasuddin Ahmed 
						filed a case with Ramna Police station on 24 September 
						1997, about kidnapping and killing of his brother. &nbsp;This 
						case could very well be one of the routine FIR that 
						Ramna police receives daily but in reality, it was not. 
						&nbsp;A sister demanding justice for his slain brother filed 
						it after long twenty-six years of the incident. &nbsp;Her 
						brother was a victim of 1971 genocide. &nbsp;All over the 
						country, still there are, like her, relatives of other 
						three million or so similar victims of genocide, who are 
						still waiting for acknowledgment and accounts. <br>
						<br>
						The Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which swung 
						into action immediately, believes he was killed &quot;under 
						the same blueprint&quot; as all other intellectuals, at the 
						fag end of the liberation war. &nbsp;The Investigators, 
						according to press reports, have assumed Chowdhury Mueen 
						Uddin, Ashrafuzzaman and others behind this killing. &nbsp;Chowdhury 
						Mueen Uddin, whose picture was printed in the newspaper 
						as the principal Al-Badar killer over Bangladesh after 
						independence, was also investigated by the British 
						television, Channel Four, in a program `War Crimes File' 
						in 1995. <br>
						<br>
						The German writer Jurgen Fuchs once said to Adam Michnik, 
						a leader of the Polish opposition to communist rule 
						about crimes committed during the communist regime in 
						East Germany that &quot;if we do not solve this problem in a 
						definite way, it will haunt us.&quot; &nbsp;The past has a curious 
						habit of coming back, again and again, if a proper 
						strategy is not followed by the successor governments. 
						&nbsp;In Bangladesh, past has never left even after its 
						twenty-six years as the burden of the past could not be 
						shaken off if no justice is done. <br>
						<br>
						Tormented societies cannot forgive and forget and go on 
						to the order of a new day unless ways are found to bring 
						the society to come to terms. Filing of Ms. Banu's case 
						and the police investigation exemplifies that in 
						Bangladesh, past has, as yet, remained to be solved. <br>
						<br>
						The purpose of this article is to find out the 
						strategies, in general, for a nation to cope with its 
						past. &nbsp;It then intents to examine the process adopted in 
						Bangladesh to deal with the past, in this case, 1971 
						genocide. &nbsp;Finally, some conclusions to devise 
						appropriate ways to live with the past will be made, 
						which batters the society daily. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Criminal Prosecution:</b> <br>
						<br>
						By bringing action against perpetrators, their superiors 
						and collaborators, a new regime can signal to victims 
						and to the whole community that the state no longer 
						considers the victims to be outcasts. &nbsp;The judicial 
						process itself can also permit individual survivors and 
						relatives and friends of victims to tell their stories, 
						to document the torment and the suffering and to 
						ventilate the feelings and emotions that have remained 
						pent-up inside. <br>
						<br>
						Another important reason for prosecuting those who 
						commit and those who order genocide is that those who 
						have been the direct victims will then see that justice 
						has been done. &nbsp;For victims, seeing their tormentors 
						brought to justice can have a strong therapeutic effect. 
						&nbsp; Punishing the perpetrators of the old regime advances 
						the cause of building or reconstructing a morally just 
						society. &nbsp;Justice be done to put back in place the moral 
						order that has broken down. &nbsp;Justice be done as a moral 
						obligation to the victims of the repression. &nbsp;Post- 
						genocide justice serves to heal the wounds and repair 
						the private and public damage done. &nbsp;It also acts, as a 
						sort of ritual cleansing process. &nbsp;A country in which 
						such cleansing remains unfinished are plagued by 
						continuous brooding and pondering. <br>
						<br>
						Criminal prosecutions also strengthens fragile 
						democracies. &nbsp;Survival of the successor regime depends 
						on swift and firm action against the perpetrators and 
						their following. &nbsp;If the prosecution issue remains 
						untouched, other forms of social and political 
						disturbance may be triggered, with perhaps a risk of 
						vigilante justice with summery executions. &nbsp;It may also 
						give birth to conspiracy theories in which the leaders 
						of the successor regime are labeled as the hidden agents 
						of the old order that they are treating in a too soft 
						and ambiguous way. <br>
						<br>
						Failure to prosecute may generate in the populace 
						cynicism and distrust toward the political system. 
						&nbsp;Unless the crimes of the defeated are investigated and 
						punished, there can be no real growth of trust, no 
						implanting of democratic norms in the society at large, 
						and therefore no genuine consolidation of democracy. 
						&nbsp;Prosecutions are seen as the most potent deterrent 
						against future abuses of human rights. &nbsp;A civilized 
						society must recognize the worth and dignity of those 
						victimized by abuses of the past. &nbsp;This has been the 
						official policy toward collaborators in all West 
						European countries which, during World War II, were 
						occupied by Germans. <br>
						<br>
						After Hitler's occupation and genocide, the slogan in 
						occupying countries were; &quot;no place left for those who 
						had betrayed their country.&quot; &nbsp;The number of unpatriotic 
						citizens who suffered punishment in one or another form 
						was about 100.000 in Belgium, 110.000 in The 
						Netherlands, and 130.000 in France. &nbsp;The figure was 
						remarkably high in Belgium and The Netherlands, which 
						had in 1945, population of 8.3 and 8.8 million 
						respectively. &nbsp;The number of death penalties was 6.763 
						in France, 2.940 in Belgium, and 152 in The Netherlands. 
						&nbsp;Various prison sentences were awarded to 53.000 in 
						Belgium, 49.000 in The Netherlands, and 40.000 in 
						France. &nbsp;Imprisonment was almost always accompanied by 
						other sanctions: a fine, confiscation of personal goods, 
						police supervision after the end of the prison term, the 
						obligation to reside in a specific town. &nbsp;In Belgium, 
						damages had to be paid to the state, out of marital 
						goods or from their heirs if necessary. &nbsp;Tens of 
						thousands of Dutchmen suffered the loss of nationality. 
						&nbsp;In Germany, international community put the principal 
						perpetrators of holocaust on trial, and others were 
						tried too. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Disqualification: <br>
						<br>
						</b>Disqualification of the perpetrators, of their 
						agents or of other willing participants, is a second way 
						to address the question. &nbsp;The idea being, those who have 
						acted against the people or have collaborated, forfeited 
						some of their rights, including political and civil 
						rights, sometimes disqualification accompanies a 
						criminal conviction, as occurred in post-war Belgium, 
						France, and The Netherlands. &nbsp;These countries also 
						introduced some form of `national indignity', which 
						implied a series of civic disqualifications and a 
						prohibition of some kinds of professional activity. &nbsp;In 
						other instances, as in most of the post-communist 
						countries of East and Central Europe, disqualification 
						has been preferred as a way to sidestep criminal 
						prosecution. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Amnesty: <br>
						<br>
						</b>Post-genocide traumatized society often has to make 
						a dichotomous choice between two perilous options, 
						should the perpetrators be prosecuted or should they be 
						amnestied in the interests of national reconciliation? 
						For purely politically motivated crimes, granting of 
						unconditional amnesty could be an option. &nbsp;In some 
						instances, the outgoing government unilaterally award 
						themselves self-amnesty. &nbsp;In other instances impunity, 
						is the outcome of negotiations between old and new 
						leaders. <br>
						<br>
						Amnesty endangers the inculcation of codes of conduct 
						based on rule of law. &nbsp;It is discriminatory application 
						of criminal law, privileging certain defendants, which 
						bread cynicism toward the rule of law. Moreover, States 
						have the duty to prosecute violations of international 
						law like genocide. &nbsp;Such crimes cannot be unilaterally 
						forgiven; even a victim society cannot forgive crimes 
						against humanity. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Truth Commission: <br>
						<br>
						</b>Amnesty, but not amnesia, is the substance of the 
						fourth strategy. &nbsp;The first goal of such a commission is 
						to investigate the fates, under the occupying regime, of 
						individuals and of the nation as a whole. &nbsp;A truth 
						telling operation, including full disclosure of human 
						rights abuses, ensure that &quot;the facts&quot; are not forgotten 
						but remain alive in the memory. <br>
						<br>
						The perpetrators come out openly, reveal all the facts 
						and face the victims publicly and see the results of 
						their actions. &nbsp;Recent examples are the Chilean National 
						Commission on Truth and Reconciliation (1990), the 
						United Nations sponsored Truth Commission in El Salvador 
						and ongoing Truth Commission in South Africa. &nbsp;However, 
						for some, general knowledge of the truth is not enough. 
						&nbsp;An official recognition of the injustices that have 
						been suffered is necessary. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Reparation: <br>
						<br>
						</b>For the families of victims and survivors, 
						compensation serves as immediate public recognition of 
						their pain and trauma. &nbsp;The most concrete form of 
						reparation is monetary compensation. Financial 
						constraints may not permit large-scale payments, but it 
						is still important to provide financial compensation to 
						the victim family either individually or the whole 
						community. &nbsp;Examples are abound, Germany's reparation to 
						Jews and Israel, Japan's to Korea. <br>
						<br>
						</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Permanent 
						Reminders: <br>
						<br>
						</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Establishment 
						of permanent reminders of the past, such as monuments, 
						museums, public holidays, and ceremonies together with 
						support group, provide a channel of non-violent 
						_expression of pain, frustration and anger. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Public Airing Of Grievances: <br>
						<br>
						</b>The public airing of grievances in a non-criminal 
						context could possibly promote an atmosphere in which 
						some kind of national reconciliation would be feasible. 
						&nbsp;Publicly acknowledging the torment and suffering of 
						victims and survivors can help in the recovery of their 
						social and political well being as it helps them 
						psychologically and contributes to defusing potential 
						cycles of revenge and victimization. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Documentation: <br>
						<br>
						</b>It is very important to establish a permanent 
						historical record that would inform and educate future 
						generations to prevent similar atrocities. &nbsp;Future 
						generations must be taught about the dangers of 
						repeating the past. <br>
						<br>
						Thus, documentation of genocide and identification of 
						the violators in some kind of public record at the 
						national or at the international should be done. &nbsp;Oral 
						histories of survivors and other witnesses can be 
						collected. &nbsp;Testimonies of perpetrators and their 
						superiors can be recorded. &nbsp;Findings of the Commissions, 
						trial transcripts, or the perpetrators own 
						documentations should be published. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Voices Of The Victims: <br>
						<br>
						</b>Another avenue of redress could be forums with 
						opportunities for survivors in communicating their 
						stories. First hand testimonies of survivors could be 
						incorporated into programs in military and police 
						courses, medical and law schools. &nbsp; Similarly, they 
						could be invited to lecture in primary and secondary 
						schools, in history and social studies classes, and in 
						university in various relevant courses. &nbsp;In press and 
						broadcasting, victims perspectives are particularly 
						pertinent. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Bangladesh: Botched Strategies <br>
						<br>
						</b>Bangladesh had to deal with the aftermath of 
						genocide soon after the perpetrator's defeat. It became 
						an inescapable task for the new democracy. &nbsp;The 
						incidents of private revenges began to be noticed, and 
						the state quite rightly made choices to prosecute the 
						perpetrators and the collaborators. <br>
						<br>
						It was expected that by applying the law firmly and 
						fairly, the state will avoid vigilantism. But the new 
						government, it transpires, did not have a well thought 
						out strategy to deal with the post-genocide society. In 
						Bangladesh, the genocide was carried out by the 
						Pakistani government and its army, alongside the war of 
						occupation. &nbsp;In Pakistan, the leadership and the elites, 
						mostly migrated from India, were essentially racist, 
						held &quot;superior race&quot; view vis-à-vis Bangladeshis. &nbsp;This 
						was epitomized by General Ayub Khan, when, as early as 
						1954, he jotted down his thoughts that Bangalees &quot;have 
						all the inhibitions of down-trodden races and have not 
						yet found it possible to adjust psychologically to the 
						requirements of the new-born freedom.&quot; (Mohammad Ayub 
						Khan, Friends No Masters: A Political Biography, 1967, 
						page 187). <br>
						<br>
						Pakistani leadership mixed racial chauvinism with 
						religion, and the resultant cocktail was the basis of 
						genocide. &nbsp;The politics just triggered off the genocide 
						mechanism. &nbsp;Pakistanis were led to believe both by their 
						political and religious leaders, about the &quot;imported&quot; 
						nature of Islam in their part of Pakistan and as such 
						&quot;purer&quot; than &quot;converted&quot; Bangladesh Muslims from lower 
						caste Hindus. <br>
						<br>
						In 1970, when the people of Bangladesh overwhelmingly 
						voted for virtual autonomy to run their own affair and 
						not to remain a market for overpriced Pakistani products 
						and source of capital for Pakistan's development, 
						Pakistani military and political elites jointly drew-up 
						two plans, firstly, to unleash unimaginable terror, 
						killings and destructions, to cow the people and then to 
						&quot;cleanse East Pakistan once and for all of the threat of 
						secession&quot; and planned to &quot;kill off two million people 
						and ruling the province as a colony for 30 years.&quot; &nbsp;The 
						combination of racial hate, religion and 
						politico-economic interests converged and formed classic 
						background for a genocide. &nbsp;Hitler too believed Jews to 
						be `unclean' plague and threat to German Aryan race. He 
						was weary of Jews growing hold over economy who conspire 
						against Germany. Pakistanis too never trusted Bangalees 
						where it mattered most, in power. &nbsp;Bangalees fought 
						back, first, in defense and then to get the country free 
						from Pakistani occupation. &nbsp;The war started and the 
						Pakistanis began a loosing battle. &nbsp;Pakistanis too, on 
						one front, faced the valiant Freedom Fighters, 
						guerrillas and regular sorts and on the other hand, 
						meticulously carried out genocidal plan. &nbsp;The result: 
						total destruction of infrastructure and economy of 
						Bangladesh, ten million people driven out of the 
						country, twenty million people internally displaced, 
						fifteen million houses set ablaze, three hundred 
						thousand women raped and three million killed. &nbsp;The new 
						government, within six weeks of victory, introduced 
						laws, the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) 
						Order, 1972 (P.O.No.8 of 1972), to deal with the 
						collaborators who had &quot;participated with or aided or 
						abetted the occupation army in maintaining, sustaining, 
						strengthening, supporting or furthering the illegal 
						occupation of Bangladesh by such army.&quot; &nbsp;The 
						Collaborators Order did not contain punishment for 
						planning or organizing genocide, which took over a year 
						and half to produce. <br>
						<br>
						In July,1973, the parliament passed the International 
						Crimes Act (Tribunals) Act,1973 (Act No. XIX of 1973) to 
						provide for detention, prosecution and punishment for 
						genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other 
						crimes under international law. &nbsp;The Act was to set-up a 
						Tribunal with power &quot;to try and punish any person 
						irrespective of his nationality who, being a member of 
						any armed, defense and auxiliary forces commits or has 
						committed, in the territory of Bangladesh, crimes 
						against humanity, crimes against peace, genocide and war 
						crimes, whether before or after the commencement of this 
						Act.&quot; &nbsp;The law, at last, provided forums to prosecute 
						the principal perpetrators and planners of genocide, the 
						army and the members of paramilitary organizations like, 
						the Razakars, Al-Badars, Al-Shams etc. <br>
						<br>
						Thus, the government chose to put the collaborators, 
						mainly the local people, who participated or aided the 
						occupation army in maintaining illegal occupation, on 
						trial first, instead of the principal planners and 
						perpetrators of genocide. &nbsp;A number of them were picked 
						up and faced the Special Tribunals. &nbsp;However, in 
						November, 1973 the government decided to release, under 
						an amnesty order, all those held and convicted under the 
						Collaborators Order for national reconciliation. &nbsp;The 
						amnesty was massively misconstrued and widely abused. 
						&nbsp;In the end, all the collaborators of genocide were 
						freed. <br>
						<br>
						As the later events showed, not a single individual was 
						finally prosecuted and tried for genocide in Bangladesh. 
						&nbsp;The new elites this botched strategy of criminal 
						prosecution for genocide failed. &nbsp;It did not do any 
						justice to the victims who died, did not satisfy people 
						like Ms. Farida Banu, immediate families of the victims. 
						&nbsp;Finally, it failed to generate any reconciliation 
						between the perpetrators and the victims because the 
						government acted alone in deciding the strategy and then 
						granting amnesty. <br>
						<br>
						The victim families and the nation at large was not 
						consulted in any manner. &nbsp;The high principles of rule of 
						law was sacrificed. &nbsp;Questions began cropping up, if one 
						was not punished for crime like genocide of three 
						million, then what crime merited punishment? <br>
						<br>
						Secondly, Bangladesh also tried &quot;disqualification&quot; 
						strategy again not in any cohesive manner. 
						&nbsp;Disqualification was not to be a part of criminal 
						prosecution as there were not much prosecution to start 
						with. &nbsp;Even disqualification was not practiced 
						independently of criminal prosecution. <br>
						<br>
						As such, the collaborators did not forfeit any civil or 
						political rights despite their collaboration. &nbsp;No one 
						was disqualified from exercising civil and political 
						rights in a new country whose birth they opposed in 
						participating in genocide. <br>
						<br>
						The government, instead, prohibited politics based on 
						religion. Article 12 of the newly adopted Constitution 
						declared: &quot;The principle of secularism shall be realized 
						by elimination of (a) communalism in all its forms; (b) 
						the granting by the State of political status in favor 
						of any religion; (c) the abuse of religion for political 
						purposes; (d) any discrimination against, or persecution 
						of, persons practicing a particular religion.&quot; &nbsp;However, 
						Article 12 of the Constitution of Bangladesh containing 
						fundamental state principles of secularism was removed 
						by General Ziaur Rahman through Martial Law Proclamation 
						Order No. I of 1977. <br>
						<br>
						Thus, however commendable, this strategy to deal with 
						genocide failed too. &nbsp;Government's compensation scheme 
						for the victim families has not worked either nor other 
						attempts of reconciliation, rather the fault-line has 
						expanded to divide the society right in the middle. <br>
						<br>
						<b>Ways Ahead: <br>
						<br>
						</b>Finally, Bangladesh must now devise appropriate 
						strategy to deal with the past from various 
						alternatives. &nbsp;The worst solution would be to try to 
						ignore the problem; the cost of cover-up are simply too 
						big as the last twenty-six years have demonstrated. &nbsp;But 
						the leaders should never forget that the lack of 
						political pressure to put these issues on the agenda 
						does not mean that they are not boiling underground, 
						waiting to erupt. They will come back to haunt. &nbsp;There 
						are some who believe economic development will be the 
						panacea. &nbsp;They are wrong. Developed countries like 
						Germany, France, Germany are still struggling to come to 
						term with the past despite building affluent societies. 
						&nbsp;Social harmony, peace and human rights are necessary 
						ingredients for human and economic development and 
						without justice, there cannot be harmony, piece and 
						human rights. <br>
						<br>
						Reconciliation is seen as a crucial prerequisite for the 
						consolidation of a young democracy. &nbsp;To some analysts, 
						reconciliation can only be produced if the successor 
						elite refrain from prosecuting the previous regime. 
						&nbsp;Others, however, argue that impunity precludes the 
						coming of reconciliation. &nbsp;In Bangladesh, lack of 
						prosecution has failed to bring reconciliation or the 
						strengthening of democracy. <br>
						<br>
						In post-genocide Bangladesh, the religious fanaticism, 
						extremism and fundamentalism have made solid inroad into 
						the society. &nbsp;Successive governments have, for political 
						convenience, compromised and on occasions cajoled 
						Islamic fanatics. &nbsp;The Collaborators, even after 
						amnesty, continued activities to throttle down the 
						spirits of liberation, which has given rise to demands 
						for new laws to curb the activities of Islamic 
						fundamentalist and communal elements. &nbsp;These Islamic 
						parties propagate same brand of Islam which resulted in 
						genocide in 1971, the communal, sexist, hate and 
						violence. <br>
						<br>
						Hence, for justice and reconciliation, some prosecutions 
						must go ahead. No new laws, however, are required. &nbsp;The 
						Collaborators Order, though has since been repealed, the 
						International Crimes Act,1973 still remains a valid law. 
						&nbsp;The Act is a complete law in itself. It provides 
						setting-up a Tribunal to try four specific offenses, 
						namely, crimes against humanity and peace, genocide and 
						war crime; with provisions for prosecution, 
						investigation, procedure of trial and appeal. Under 
						Section 21, a person convicted and sentenced shall can 
						appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court.
						<br>
						<br>
						Under the Act, those who were members of the auxiliary 
						forces in 1971, either structured or shadowy, should be 
						investigated and then brought to justice. &nbsp;People like 
						Mueen Uddin should be tried under International Crimes 
						(Tribunals) Act,1973 for genocide and not under the 
						conventional penal law. &nbsp;These people are not the usual 
						criminals, but, planners and executioners of genocide 
						and should, therefore, be punished for committing 
						genocide. &nbsp;The investigators have reportedly said, they 
						would try to deal with the killings of all the 
						intellectuals as all of them were killed under the same 
						blueprint by the same group. &nbsp;The blueprint was that of 
						genocide and as such, the investigators should press 
						charges under the International War Crimes Act. <br>
						<br>
						Successive governments have also failed to obtain any 
						reparation from Pakistan for genocide and destruction 
						caused in 1971. &nbsp;No Pakistani leader has yet offered any 
						apology to the people of Bangladesh. &nbsp;Even the Queen of 
						The Netherlands has recently apologized to the people of 
						Indonesia for the atrocities committed during the 
						colonial period. &nbsp;So also the Japanese king and the 
						President of Germany. &nbsp;Instead, the average Pakistanis 
						are still being fed with concocted history. Few 
						Pakistanis have any idea how their best army, composed 
						of martial races, lost to ragtag irregular Freedom 
						Fighters and to inferior Indian forces. &nbsp;The modern 
						technology has offered us the opportunity to put our 
						side of the story directly to Pakistani people via 
						Internet, and create opinion based on true facts. 
						Pakistani government is, under international law, 
						obliged to try the war criminals and perpetrators of 
						genocide, besides payments of compensation. <br>
						<br>
						In 1971, the genocide, which was carried out while the 
						war was on, also has international ramifications. &nbsp;The 
						government of the United States of America was at the 
						time helping the genocidal regime of Yahya Khan. &nbsp;It is, 
						therefore, necessary to find out more of the official 
						role of the United States government to determine how 
						much US government was aware of genocidal plans and 
						what, if any, was done to stop it. In this regard, a 
						campaign for a US Congress hearing, in line with the 
						Cambodian hearing, should be launched and the members of 
						the Bangladesh community in United States could take 
						lead in this matter. <br>
						<br>
						As already observed, in Bangladesh, the liberation war 
						and genocide have often been equated, though both 
						occurred pari passu, liberation war and genocide were 
						separate events. &nbsp;The fallen heroes of the liberation 
						war are rightly honored when the nation ceremonially 
						pays its respect on Independence and Victory days, but, 
						three million victims of genocide are not remembered in 
						the same fashion on a given day. <br>
						<br>
						A day, on the other hand, is observed as &quot;Buddhijibi 
						Hotta Dibosh&quot; in December to mark the killings of the 
						intellectuals, which could easily be expanded to include 
						all the victims of genocide and the day could be 
						observed instead as &quot;Gonohotta Dibosh,&quot; as a remembrance 
						day of all the genocide victims. &nbsp;In fact, killings of 
						the intellectuals was the final chapter of Pakistani 
						genocidal plan to deprive the nation of its finest 
						brains and thus, it became a total genocide. <br>
						<br>
						When a regime ends violently because of war against an 
						occupying army or a civil war or genocide, anomia is 
						inescapable. But the duty of the successor government is 
						to strike a balance and draw up the strategy that 
						delivers justice.<br>
