	<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Over the past several years, the 
	scientific community has found itself absorbed within the ongoing conflict 
	between creationists and biologists over the validity in Darwin 's theory of 
	evolution via natural selection. It is not a very recent battle abroad the 
	international sphere, but upon the advent of the evangelical movement, it 
	has gained much momentum in the United States . </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, however, there is a new 
	contestant in this battle among the `intellects': Islam. On July 17th, The 
	New York Times published a piece on a vociferous and stirring figure, Adnan 
	Oktar, who maintains the site Harun Yahya. He is an Islamic creationist of 
	Turkish origin who argues that evolution is a deception of the truth and has 
	been responsible for fascism, communism, and terrorism. In addition to the 
	site, he has composed an `Atlas of Creation' which has been distributed to 
	academic institutions and congressmen across the entire USA . [1] </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The multitude of evidences is always 
	there and the duality between fact and theory is a serious one, not so often 
	reducibly explicable. To contend the Darwinist viewpoint of the world relies 
	on strictly empirical questions with implicit relevance to a couple of 
	important points that are to be raised, however. First, from a scientific 
	perspective, Mr. Oktar's unsubstantiated vilification of evolution is 
	aggressively disserving towards the advance and progress of humanity's 
	scientific pursuits. Since the discovery of Darwinian biology, the 
	technological industry has gone through a tremendous shift. The development 
	of the antibiotic, for example, has been elegantly perfected through 
	mastering its application upon populations of bacteria. The ability to 
	calculate successive results was only promised by considering the 
	implications of micro-mutational natural selection, which is something 
	observably expressed by these microbial pathogens. Another innovation which 
	is arising is in cancer research. Scientists are beginning to map out a 
	moderately coherent explanation of why cancer survives the defense lines of 
	human cellular machinery. It turns out that cancer-causing mutations can 
	actually favor the reproduction and proliferation of certain pockets of 
	cells over others; cancer adapts through natural selection. Additionally, it 
	has also been found that over manifold generations of hominid-evolution, 
	certain cancer-causing genes have actually been credited with the production 
	of particular proteins that specify important functions of life. [2] This is 
	a very powerful realization and offers important hindsight into the future 
	of medical advancement. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The prospect of searching for 
	intelligence elsewhere in the cosmos, within the threat-zone of such 
	stagnating ideologies akin to Oktar's, renders serious questions for the 
	21st century pioneers of science. The very aspiration in exploring the 
	universe for potential life is based on a deeply rigid understanding of the 
	natural processes that allow bio-habitability to evolve and stabilize in the 
	first place. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Secondly, one might be intrigued, 
	even entertained, by Oktar's accusations of fascism, communism, and terror. 
	This unfounded incrimination offers one insight into Oktar's mind-set and 
	consequentially affords one the chance to ask critical questions of the same 
	magnitude: can Mr. Oktar show it was evolutionary theory that unleashed the 
	attacks of 9/11? Is it evolutionary theory that has caused the suicide 
	bombings, decapitations, and indiscriminate killings of tens and thousands 
	of Iraqis? Does evolutionary theory bare responsibility for the cruelty of 
	Sharia Law in Iran and reduce the status of the women to ½ of male 
	intelligence (in accordance with Iran 's testimony laws)? [3] Does 
	evolutionary theory degenerate the Bahais as being unclean kuffar? Did 
	evolutionary theory wreak upon Bangladesh the genocide of more than 1 
	million people? Was it evolutionary theory which propagated the 15-year 
	Lebanese civil war? Was it evolutionary theory which caused Saudi Arabia to 
	revert to a culture of cavemen? If anything this is what I call evidence of 
	devolution and it is the influence of religion (Islam in particular) which 
	has promoted fascism and terrorism across the entire world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In comparison science has been 
	greatly beneficial to the Muslim world. The author of the popular internet 
	blog, Healing Iraq [4], wrote an excellent article on the historical roots 
	of Iraqi secularism. During the early century, following the Ottoman 
	reforms, an educated elite emerged called the efendiyya who had challenged 
	the dogma and superstitions of the Iraqi religious clergy. To quote directly 
	from the article: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The efendiyya in Iraq introduced and 
	promoted many secular and scientific theories that were shocking to the 
	clergy  such as Darwin 's theory of evolution and natural selection, 
	Einstein's theories of relativity and quantum physics, Marxist dialectical 
	and historical materialism, Freudian psychology, and socialist political 
	theories [5] </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After moderate-minded families saw 
	the benefits offered by education and science, they wisely abandoned the 
	empty words of the religious right and fruitfully embraced reason. Children 
	received the proper tools they needed to become successful businessmen, 
	engineers, technocrats and scientists rather than recline in the low-status 
	positions reserved for the uneducated sector of the populace. Even 
	gender-equality was promoted within the work field. Where the religious 
	clergy failed in their unfulfilled promises, science and reason delivered 
	manifestly positive results. Indeed, this same trend occurred throughout the 
	Arab world contemporarily with the transition from religion to science.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is just perplexing to think that 
	Mr. Oktar could not shuffle up any other words from the entire vocabulary 
	besides `fascism, communism, and terrorism.' The paradoxical implications 
	are just staggering. Was it Charles Darwin who boasted *`I have been made 
	victorious with terror?' Was it Darwinists fueled by fascistic anti-Jewish 
	sentiments who mobilized their own Islamic SS unit (the Mufti from Palestine 
	), in subservience to Hitler? Was it `communistic Darwinists' in Iran who 
	synthesized Islamic precepts with Marxism during the 60's 
	(Mujahedeen-e-Khalq), which transformed them into one of the most 
	destabilizing militant organizations of the region? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even when taking a glance back in 
	history during the golden days of the Muslim world, it was secular leaders 
	who adopted reason and tolerated the scientific endeavor of the existing 
	intelligentsia at the time. The less Islam was involved, the less terrorism 
	and violence surfaced, and greater degrees of scientific achievements 
	transpired. The Caliph Al-Mamun, who built the House of Wisdom during the 
	8th century in Baghdad , implemented policies that were often in conflict 
	with the religiously orthodox Muslims of the day. He built a modern school 
	dedicated to learning and driven by the search for higher truths rather then 
	enforcing old-school dogma. It was a Middle Eastern enlightenment. This led 
	to the construction of great edifices of knowledge, such as libraries and 
	observatories, managed by intellectual circles of astronomers, philosophers, 
	mathematicians, and scholars in many other important fields. Among these 
	intellectual strata was the more prominently known genius of al-Khawarizmi, 
	who revolutionized mathematics in Baghdad. It was even recorded that during 
	Mamun's period of rule, women held the most respected professional roles, 
	not to be seen for a long time afterwards. [6] </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another marker which might catch the 
	eye is that Mr. Oktar is a staunchly anti-Zionist ideologue in contrast to 
	the fervently pro-Israeli nature of the Christian evangelical community. It 
	is a bit strange that these factions with such unshakeable convictions 
	regarding universal truth almost always carry some sort of earthly political 
	baggage with them. Is it not they who claim that the foresight of human 
	beings should transcend all the `trivial' earthly relishes such as material, 
	politics, and personal greed? One might find more irony, than sense, from 
	the whole notion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ergo, in conclusion, a rational 
	spectator might give Adnan Oktar a sharp reply which reveals the 
	contradictions in his own ludicrous hypothesis that evolutionary science has 
	been responsible for fascism, terrorism, and communism. In retrospection of 
	history, it becomes quite implicative that when the Muslim world followed 
	scientific reason and enlightenment, prosperity and happiness bloomed. 
	Conversely, when uncritically paying heed to the very letters of Islam, 
	Muslims have only found themselves in a reduced state of despair, poverty, 
	and war. The aura of Islam paralyzes the mind from functioning; it fogs the 
	clarity of rational vision. It is when the agents of freethinking begin to 
	condense and buffer the way for the intellect that the rational self becomes 
	an independent entity like a bird liberated from a cage. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims are imprisoned by their 
	subordination to Allah. They need to be shown that nothing is above the 
	dictum of the individual conscience. This is an inviolable maxim and Islam 
	is the existential fabrication profaning it. It is a machine of lies and its 
	time to challenge it before the consequences become irreversible. </font>
