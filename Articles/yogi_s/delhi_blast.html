	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Responsibility for last week’s 
	deadly bomb blasts in Delhi has been claimed by a little-known outfit the 
	Islami Inqilabi Mahaz (‘Islamic Revolutionary Front’), said to be sponsored 
	by the Pakistan-based Lashkar-i Tayyeba. Ruthless terror is the hallmark of 
	the Lashkar, fired as it is by an irrepressible hatred of non-Muslims, whom 
	it sees as, by definition, anti-Islam. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Lashkar is the armed wing of the 
	Markaz Dawat wal Irshad ('Centre for Invitation and Instruction'), an 
	organisation affiliated to the Ahl-i Hadith sect, which follows a version of 
	Islam almost identical with that of the Saudi Wahhabis. It is today the 
	single most powerful militant outfit operating in Kashmir. Its involvement 
	in Kashmir goes back to the early 1990s, when Pakistan began patronising 
	radical Islamist outfits to counter the influence of the Jammu and Kashmir 
	Liberation Front which had inaugurated the armed uprising against Indian 
	rule. The Front’s agenda of an independent and secular Kashmir was clearly 
	not to the liking of the Pakistani establishment, who saw in radical 
	Islamist outfits a more reliable ally, with their opposition to Kashmiri 
	nationalism and their advocacy of Kashmir’s union with Pakistan. In setting 
	up the Lashkar the late Abdullah Azam a close aide of Osama bin Laden, then 
	associated with the International Islamic University, Islamabad, also played 
	a key role. Funds for the organization are said to have come from Saudi 
	Arabia and Pakistan's secret services agency, the Inter Services 
	Intelligence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Like other radical Islamist outfits, 
	the Lashkar sees Islam as a perfect, all- embracing system. Islam is said to 
	govern all aspects life in the form of the shari'ah. For the establishing of 
	an Islamic system an Islamic state is seen as necessary in order to impose 
	the shar'iah as the law of the land. If such a state were to be set up and 
	all Muslims were to live strictly according to 'the laws that Allah has laid 
	down', then, the Lashkar argues, 'they would be able to control the whole 
	world and exercise their supremacy'. Since Muslims throughout the world are 
	members of a global ummah, the Lashkar insists that there should be a single 
	global Islamic state with one Caliph ruling over all the faithful. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The struggle for the establishment 
	of the Islamic state can take various forms, peaceful as well as violent. 
	Islam, the Lashkar says, is 'a religion of peace and harmony', and seeks to 
	'eliminate mischief and disorder, and to provide peace, not only to Muslims 
	but also to the entire humanity'. However, it stresses, Muslims are 
	commanded to take to armed struggle, or jihad, to defend their 
	co-religionists suffering from the oppression of others. As the Lashkar sees 
	it, such a situation is said to prevail over much of the world today. While 
	jihad in defence of Islam and of Muslims labouring under oppression is 
	presented as a liberation struggle, it is also seen as a means for Islam to 
	'prevail on this earth', for Islam is seen as the only true religion. Armed 
	jihad must continue, the Lashkar insists, 'until Islam, as a way of life, 
	dominates the whole world and until Allah's law is enforced everywhere in 
	the world'. Since Islam is meant for all peoples, the Islamic State must 
	spearhead a movement to spread Islam all over the world, so the Lashkar 
	believes. In the course of this struggle, it is expected that it will 
	encounter conflict with other states and their ideologies. The conflict can 
	be resolved through peaceful diplomacy, but, if that fails, then, the 
	Lashkar argues, the only course left open is armed jihad. In this sense, the 
	Lashkar believes, jihad is 'the foreign policy' of the Islamic State. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The subject of armed jihad runs 
	right through the writings and pronouncements of the Lashkar and is, in 
	fact, the most prominent theme in its discourse although it has 
	traditionally not been included as one of the 'five pillars' of the faith. 
	Indeed, the Lashkar’s understanding of Islam maybe seen as determined almost 
	wholly by this preoccupation, so much so that its reading of Islam seems to 
	be a product of its own political project. In the writings and speeches of 
	Lashkar spokesmen jihad appears as violent conflict waged against 
	'unbelievers' who are said to be responsible for the oppression of the 
	Muslims. The Lashkar claims that 'There is so much emphasis on this subject 
	that some commentators and scholars of the Quran have remarked that the 
	topic of the Quran is jihad’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The global jihadist programme of the 
	Lashkar presents itself as a 'liberationist' project, basing itself on 
	widespread feelings of discontent and suffering among many Muslims. 'All 
	Muslims', the Lashkar believes, are oppressed today, by such 'enemies' as 
	the Hindus, the Jews and Christians. 'Wherever you look, you will find that 
	non-believers are everywhere trying to enslave Muslims and destroy them', it 
	argues. Hence, it says, Muslims must form a 'solid bloc' to defend 
	themselves from these 'enemies', and if all peaceful means fail they must 
	resort to armed jihad for their liberation. This Muslim bloc, it suggests, 
	should be led by both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and have its headquarters 
	at Mecca. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Lashkar sees jihad as the secret 
	of Muslim power in the past when much of the known world was under Muslim 
	rule, and it is argued that when Muslims 'abandoned jihad and other 
	injunctions they began to degenerate'. In Lashkar discourse, jihad is 
	projected as a religious duty binding on all Muslims today. Thus, it is 
	claimed that the prevailing global situation warrants all Muslims to be 
	involved in some way or the other in jihad against non-Muslim 'oppressors'. 
	In this grand enterprise there are different roles for different people to 
	play. Muslims are promised that they would receive great rewards, both in 
	this world and in the Hereafter, if they were to actively struggle in the 
	path of jihad. Not only would they be guaranteed a place in Heaven, but they 
	would also 'be honoured in this world', for jihad is, according to a Lashkar 
	spokesman, also 'the way that solves financial and political problems'.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Lashkar sees its involvement in 
	the armed struggle in Kashmir as only one stage of a global jihad against 
	the forces of ‘disbelief’, stopping at nothing short of the conquest of the 
	entire world. As Qari Abdul Wahid, former amir of the Lashkar in 
	Indian-administered Kashmir, puts it, 'We will uphold the flag of freedom 
	and Islam through jihad not only in Kashmir but in the whole world’. 
	Likewise, Nazir Ahmed, in-charge of the public relations department of the 
	Markaz, the Lashkar’s parent body, declares that through the jihad that the 
	mujahidin have launched in Kashmir, 'Islam will be dominant all over the 
	world, Inshallah (God willing)’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Lashkar discourse the conflict in 
	Kashmir is seen not as a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan, but 
	as nothing less than a war between two different and mutually opposed 
	ideologies: Islam, on the one hand, and disbelief, on the other. This is 
	portrayed as one chapter in a long a struggle between the two that is said 
	to have characterised the history of Hindu-Muslim relations for the last 
	1400 years ever since the advent of the Prophet Muhammad. The Prophet is 
	claimed to have singled out India as a special target for jihad, or so the 
	Lashkar insists. 'Whosoever will take part in jihad against India', Lashkar 
	leader Muhammad Ibrahim Salaf claims that the Prophet had declared, 'Allah 
	will set him free from the pyre of hell'. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Lashkar sees the roots of the 
	Kashmir problem as lying in its Muslim rulers having been replaced, first by 
	the Sikhs and then by the Hindu Dogras through British assistance. With 
	India (the 'Hindus') having taken over Kashmir in 1947, a long reign of 
	bloody terror is said to have been unleashed on the Kashmiri Muslims. This 
	is seen as a direct and logical consequence of the teachings of Hinduism 
	itself, because, it is alleged, 'the Hindus have no compassion in their 
	religion'. Hence, the Lashkar argues, it is the duty of Muslims to wage 
	jihad against the 'Hindu oppressors', for, it insists, 'it is the Hindu who 
	is a terrorist'. All Hindus are tarred with the same brush, described in 
	such essentialist terms as 'terrorists', 'traitors', 'cowards', 'enemies', 
	etc.. Thus, Lashkar chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed declares, 'In fact, the Hindu 
	is a mean enemy and the proper way to deal with him is the one adopted by 
	our forefathers, who crushed them by force. We need to do the same'. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">India is a special target for the 
	Lashkar. As Hafiz Muhammad Saeed argues, 'The jihad is not about Kashmir 
	only. It encompasses all of India'. The Lashkar sees the jihad as going far 
	beyond the borders of Kashmir and spreading through all of India. The final 
	goal is to extend Muslim control over what is seen as having once been 
	Muslim land, and, hence, to be brought back under Muslim domination, 
	creating what the Lashkar calls 'the Greater Pakistan by dint of jihad’. 
	Thus, at a mammoth congregation in November 1999, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed 
	declared, 'Today I announce the break-up of India, Inshallah. We will not 
	rest until the whole of India is dissolved into Pakistan'. On the same 
	occasion, Amir Hamza, senior Lashkar official and editor of its Urdu organ, 
	ad-Da'wa, thundered: 'We ought to disintegrate India and even wipe India 
	out'. Those who take part in this anti-Indian jihad are promised that 'Allah 
	will save [them] from the pyre of hell', and 'huge palaces in paradise' 
	await those who are killed in fighting the 'disbelieving enemies'. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If indeed the Lashkar was behind the 
	Delhi blasts, it indicates that these bombastic anti-Indian and anti-Hindu 
	appeals of the Lashkar are no empty rhetoric and that it is deadly serious 
	about its designs of exporting terror beyond Kashmir into the rest of the 
	country, inflaming Hindu-Muslim conflict and making the solution to the 
	Kashmir dispute even more intractable.</font> </p>
