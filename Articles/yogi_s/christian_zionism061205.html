	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Represented by literally hundreds of 
	small denominations and churches today, particularly in America, Christian 
	Zionism is today a formidable force and a major actor in global politics. 
	Christian Zionism comes in various shades, but the core of its message is 
	total, unflinching support to the state of Israel and the Zionist 
	imperialist project. Christian Zionists today exercise an enormous clout in 
	the Bush administration. Bush, too, may himself be characterised in some 
	sense as a Christian Zionist, for his policies in the Middle East and 
	elsewhere clearly reflect or tally with the Christian Zionist agenda. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">War, conquest and imperialist 
	domination, based on a fanatic insistence on the absolute truth of 
	Christianity and the racial superiority of the Jews lie at the very heart of 
	Christian Zionism. Christian Zionists believe that the Jews are God’s 
	‘Chosen People’ and that God has given the Jews the absolute right to 
	complete control over not just Palestine but, indeed, a vast stretch of 
	territory, extending from present-day Egypt to Iraq, the so-called ‘Greater 
	Israel’. God, they claim, has selected the Jews above all other people. 
	Hence, they insist, those who oppose the imperialist project of the 
	advocates of ‘Greater Israel’ or the Zionist occupation of Palestine are 
	‘God’s enemies’, deserving to be crushed by every available means, including 
	outright war and decimation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Advocating Israel does not mean, 
	however, that Christian Zionists accept Judaism as a legitimate means of 
	salvation after Jesus. Nor does it translate into genuine love for the Jews, 
	a departure from the traditional teachings of the Church that, for 
	centuries, viewed Jews as ‘Christ-killers’. Since Christian Zionists believe 
	that Christianity is the only religion acceptable to God, and that, as the 
	Bible claims, salvation is possible only through Jesus, they insist that 
	Jews cannot be ‘saved’ unless they convert to Christianity. Yet, because 
	Christian Zionists are dogged defenders of the state of Israel and are 
	fiercely anti-Arab and anti-Muslim, they have been able to establish a close 
	nexus with right-wing Jewish groups and with the Israeli state and are today 
	an integral part of the American-Israeli axis. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Christian Zionism is a call for 
	global war. The belief that Christianity is the sole truth, that all other 
	faiths are ‘Satanic’ or ‘false’, that the Jews must all gather in Palestine 
	to fulfil so-called Biblical prophecies, and that a grand global war will 
	soon erupt leading to the massacre of hundreds of millions and heralding the 
	‘second coming’ of Jesus, who will establish his Christian kingdom extending 
	till the four corners of the world, clearly indicate the hate-driven, global 
	expansionist project of Christian Zionism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">John Hagee is a prime example of a 
	Christian Zionist zealot. He is the founder and pastor of the Cornerstone 
	Church, in Texas, USA, which claims some 16,000 members. As with numerous 
	other similar American Christian fundamentalist preachers, his church is 
	richly endowed and media savvy. Hagee is the president of the ‘Global 
	Evangelism’ media company that broadcasts his daily programmes on television 
	and radio throughout the USA and around the world. He is the author of 
	numerous books on Christian Zionism, some of which have been reprinted by 
	Christian fundamentalist publishers abroad as well. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">‘Final Dawn Over Jerusalem’ is one 
	of Hagee’s major writings on Christian Zionism that well exemplifies the 
	imperialist agenda that lies at its very core. The aim of the book is to 
	defend the Israeli occupation of Palestine, to denounce those who seek to 
	protest Israeli atrocities, and to advocate the cause of ‘Greater Israel’, 
	all this in the name of Christianity and premised on the notion of the Jews 
	as being allegedly God’s ‘Chosen People’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Racism is integral to the Christian 
	Zionist message, as Hagee makes amply clear. The Bible, Hagee, says, 
	describes the Jews as ‘the apple of God’s eye’ [Zech 2:8]. He quotes the 
	Bible as addressing the Jews and declaring, ‘For you are a holy people to 
	the LORD your God’ and ‘the LORD has chosen you to be a people for Himself, 
	a special treasure above all the peoples who are on the face of the earth’ 
	[Deut.14:2]. This means, so Hagee argues, that those who harm the Jews or 
	the state of Israel or stand in the way of the design of ‘Greater Israel’ 
	will ‘experience the instant wrath of God’. To those who dare to challenge 
	the oppressive Zionist state, Hagee announces, ‘The man or nation that lifts 
	a voice or hand against Israel invites the wrath of God’. Such people will, 
	Hagee insists, be ‘cursed’ by God. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hagee’s notion of God thus appears 
	to be that of a tribal Jewish deity, who functions as a willing tool in the 
	pursuit of Jewish expansionism. The Bible was written by Jewish hands, and 
	given that, as many liberal Christians would themselves concede, much of it 
	is a human product, numerous Biblical verses were written in order to 
	legitimise the interests of the community from which its writers were drawn. 
	This would seem obvious to any discerning layman, but Biblical literalists 
	like Hagee vehemently disagree. For them every word of the Bible is 
	sacrosanct and divine. Biblical literalism is pressed into the service of 
	the Christian Zionist imperialist and racist agenda. Drawing upon numerous 
	verses of the Bible, Hagee argues, ‘God watches over Israel as a protective 
	parent hovers over an only child’. ‘The nation of Israel’, he makes so bold 
	as to declare, ‘was created by a sovereign act of God. All other nations 
	were created by an act of war or a declaration of men, but Israel was 
	intentionally created by God so that He would have a physical place of 
	inheritance on the earth’. Accordingly, Hagee would have us believe that for 
	this god, who is seen as in need of a ‘physical place’ for himself, non-Jews 
	or Gentiles, are second-rate human beings or less, and so can easily be 
	dispensed with if they are seen as coming in the way of Jewish imperialism.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The tribal Jewish version of God 
	that Hagee presents appears entirely unjust and arbitrary, far from being 
	impartial in the way he deals with His creation. Given the fact that the God 
	of the Biblical literalist imagination is a Jewish deity, and not the 
	universal God who looks upon His entire creation impartially, he is seen as 
	blessing Jewish conquests of territories of their enemies. Thus, quoting the 
	Bible, Hagee writes that God gave the land of ‘Greater Israel’, a vast 
	swathe of land stretching from Egypt all the way till Iraq, to the Jews, 
	descendants of Isaac, forever. That being the case, Hagee suggests that 
	people living in those territories, millions of Arabs, both Muslims and 
	Christians, have no right to live there or else must accept to live under 
	Jewish rule. Although Hagee does not say this explicitly, what this means is 
	that those who refuse to accept Jewish rule must, therefore, be either 
	killed or expelled. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The god of Hagee’s imagination 
	appears as an entirely whimsical real estate agent. ‘God established 
	Israel’s national geographic boundaries’, Hagee writes. ‘The exact borders 
	of Israel are detailed in Scripture just as our heavenly Father dictated 
	them’, he goes on, adding, ‘The divine Surveyor drove the original stakes 
	into Judean soil and decreed that no one should ever change these property 
	lines. The real estate contract and lands covenants were signed in blood and 
	stand to this very hour’. Hence, he argues, ‘Jews have the absolute right as 
	mandated by God to the land of Israel and, more specifically, to the city of 
	Jerusalem’. Hence, he suggests, Palestinians have no claim to their own 
	historical land, and must make way for Jewish occupiers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hagee’s defence of Zionist 
	imperialism goes to ridiculous lengths. Laughable as this may sound, he 
	argues, ‘Israel has a Spy in the sky’—God Himself. God, he claims, provides 
	Israel, the Jewish people and the state of Israel, with special protection. 
	‘No nation in the world can match the defensive force guarding the State of 
	Israel. The archangel Michael has a special assignment to guard Israel’. And 
	those who, for any reason oppose Israel, and this includes Palestinians 
	fighting Israeli occupation and oppression, are said to incur God’s wrath. 
	‘The Lord stands watch in the darkest night with an eye trained on the 
	nation of Israel and, more specifically, Jerusalem. Those who fight with 
	Israel fight with Him’, Hagee asserts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So central is Israel to Hagee’s 
	tribalistic version of God that he goes to the extent of arguing that the 
	fate of each and every person on the face of the planet depends essentially 
	on his or her attitude to the Jews. ‘Prosperity or punishment depends on how 
	we treat Israel’, he alleges, because, he claims, the Jews, as descendants 
	of Abraham ‘enjoy heavenly favour’. To back his claim he quotes the Bible as 
	saying that when God entered into a covenant with Abraham, He gave him an 
	‘awesome promise’, saying, ‘I will bless those who bless you, And I will 
	curse him who curses you. And in you all the families of the earth shall be 
	blessed’ [Gen. 12:3]. Hence, Hagee insists, the United States, and, indeed, 
	anyone else who wishes to please God, must consistently engage in 
	‘compassionate support of the State of Israel’, adding that, ‘The quickest 
	and most effective way to be on God's side is to stand with the State of 
	Israel and the Jewish people in their hour of need’. By doing this, he 
	claims, one can win God’s favour, because, ‘God blesses the man or nation 
	that blesses Israel or the Jewish people’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At no time before, Hagee firmly 
	believes, has support for Israel and Zionist imperialism, been more crucial 
	than today. This is because, he claims, Jesus is returning to the world 
	soon, and Israel must be protected in order to welcome the Messiah. Hagee’s 
	image of Jesus in his ‘second coming’ bears no resemblance to the familiar 
	notion of the suffering, loving Jesus. Rather, in his description Jesus 
	appears as a fierce warrior, rallying Christians to arms and heralding the 
	final, global war, ironically in the name of the ‘Prince of Peace’. In the 
	doomsday scenario that Hagee outlines, what he calls ‘fanatical attacks’ by 
	Arabs on Israel, particularly Jerusalem, would mount. In response, 
	Christians the world over, he says, must rally behind Israel. At this hour, 
	he insists, ‘we must let the world know that if a line has to be drawn, it 
	will be drawn around Christians as well as Jews. We are united and 
	indivisible’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The city of Jersualem, Hagee 
	believes, is the crux of the final battle before Jesus’ ‘second coming’. 
	This city, considered sacred by Jews, Muslims and Christians alike, has been 
	ordained, so Hagee argues, by God to be ‘under the exclusive control of the 
	Jewish people’ until Jesus arrives again. The final battle of Armageddon 
	will, he writes, be centred on this city, with Arabs or Muslims seeking to 
	wrest control of it from the Jews. In this regard, Hagee says, Christians, 
	for their part, must staunchly defend Israel and must refuse any peace 
	offers, such as allowing for a shared Jerusalem or joint control of the town 
	by Jews and Arabs. In particular, he appeals to the United States to do 
	everything in its power to back Israel and to crush its opponents, claiming 
	this is the only way to win God’s favour. If America fails to do this, he 
	warns, it would be crushed by God Himself! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Quoting various verses of the Bible, 
	Hagee describes what he sees as the unfolding of events of cosmic 
	proportions, ushering in a global war the like of which has never been 
	witnessed hitherto and heralding the ‘second coming of Jesus’. In this 
	global war, he says, Muslims, whom he regards as followers of a ‘false’ 
	religion, would ally with the Russians to fight against Israel. This would 
	lead to a global nuclear war, with hundreds of millions being killed. At 
	this point, the ‘Anti-Christ’ will appear, attack Jerusalem and will take 
	over the reigns of the world, falsely claiming to usher in peace. But, this 
	grand deception will not last long, and, instead, will only lead to even 
	more devastating wars. At this time, Hagee says, Christians must defend, by 
	every means possible, the Jews and Israel, and wage war against the armies 
	of those opposed to God’s ‘Chosen Race’, the Jews. Only then can they be 
	saved, he insists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After years of global war and 
	terrible destruction, Hagee writes, Jesus will be sent by God to deliver the 
	world. Mounted on a white horse, he will arrive at the battlefield at 
	Armageddon. Defeating the ‘Anti-Christ’ and his army, he will establish his 
	global kingdom with his capital in Jerusalem, there to ‘rule and reign 
	forever’. Hagee’s description of Jesus’ future global kingdom offers little 
	cause to cheer for non-Christians, including, ironically, even the Jews whom 
	he so ardently defends. It would, as he himself makes clear, be nothing 
	short of a global Christian empire, and an antiquated one at that, with 
	kings and queens and presidents still in place! How they would continue to 
	be around when Jesus rules the whole world is a mystery that Hagee leaves 
	unsolved. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ruled by Jesus, Hagee writes, 
	‘Jerusalem, the apple of God’s eye, will become the joy of the world. The 
	city will become the international worship center, and people from all over 
	the world will make pilgrimages to worship in the holy temple. Kings, 
	queens, princes and presidents shall come to the Holy City’ to adore Jesus. 
	Presumably, these all will be Christians themselves, for Hagee quotes the 
	Bible as predicting that ‘at the name of Jesus every knee should bow…and 
	that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of 
	God the Father’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Hagee’s book clearly indicates, 
	Christian Zionism, rooted in tradition of the Crusades and a long history of 
	Church triumphalism, is a recipe for global war and Christian imperialism. 
	Moreover, it reflects a total lack of genuine spirituality, seeking to 
	reduce the notion of God into a petty, whimsical and racist dictator who 
	willingly urges the slaughter of innocents in order to protect the 
	expansionist designs of his supposedly ‘Chosen People’. Of course, Christian 
	Zionism is hardly unique in its use of religion for such blatantly political 
	ends, but given the immense clout enjoyed by its advocates today, especially 
	in America, it is a much more menacing threat to world peace than is 
	sometimes imagined and cannot be simply dismissed as the ravings of lunatics 
	on the fringe.</font></p>
