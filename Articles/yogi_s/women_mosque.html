	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Introduction :</b><br>
	STEPS Women’s Organization is a voluntary Service organization registered 
	under the Tamil Nadu Societies Act 1975 in 1991. It has 90% women and 10% 
	men in its Governing Body. STEPS has not adopted any particular Village or 
	Block but concentrates on all issues affecting women as individuals or as 
	social beings. Our special focus is on raising voice consistently against 
	atrocities on women. STEPS initially worked among schools and college 
	students and rural women through Awareness generation programs such as 
	poster exhibitions, workshops, competitions, imparting defense mechanism 
	etc. Various issues at the Local level and State Level are taken up and 
	maximum efforts are made to find out solution or alternatives. STEPS is 
	generally a centre for women in distress as issues concerning women. For the 
	past seven years, STEPS started concentrating more on the issues of Muslim 
	Women, which is not intervened by any one in the economy. Every one is 
	scared to touch this issue, as the issues of Muslim women are closely 
	connected with the religion and its personal laws. Islam is the only 
	religion which has provided lot of powers and rights to Muslim women. But in 
	reality women were denied of the basic rights in the name of religion by the 
	male religious leaders. In this situation, STEPS took effort in conducting 
	survey on the socio economic status of Muslim women and found the need for 
	concentrating and working for the empowerment of Muslim women.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Mission of STEPS:</b><br>
	To achieve the twin goals – social justice and gender justice by working 
	with victimized women of all sections of society and play a catalytic role. 
	Empowering women by promoting self – confidence, self respect and courage 
	and help them to prevent, resist or combat gender violence. The main aim of 
	STEPS is to Empower Muslim Women in educational, economical, social, 
	political and psychological aspects to attain holistic personality 
	development. Creation of awareness among Muslim Women about the causes for 
	discrimination and violence against them. To take up individual issues and 
	help them to find alternatives and organizing them into groups and form 
	associations to articulate their grievances and raise their voice, loud and 
	clear. To organize the Muslim Women for empowering them to assert their 
	rights to education and educate the children of destitute Muslim women. 
	Empowering the Muslim Women economically through income generation 
	activities. Conscientising them about their political and<br>
	human rights. To provide Free Legal Aid and counseling for the women in 
	distress. To provide facility for the Muslim Women in need and support those 
	in their period of crisis through the short stay home. To bring the Muslim 
	Women in to the mainstream struggle and to make them aware of their 
	religious and political roles. To form a State Level Federation for Muslim 
	Women.<br>
	<b><br>
	Major accomplishments of STEPS:</b><br>
	STEPS have formed a district level official committee to remove and take up 
	action against who display obscene posters in schools, colleges and public 
	walls. With the help of Arivoli volunteers, Nehru Yuva Kendra Youth Clubs, 
	Schools and College N.S.S. Students and Municipality Labours. Our 
	interventions brought the priest (Premananda, Tamil Nadu) to books who raped 
	17 girl children. Otherwise he would have gone scotch free. Our commitments 
	were instrumental, in the court imparting a life sentence on the priest, and 
	a compensation of Rs.5 lakhs per victim. One and half year worked for 
	National Elimination of Child Labor and we surveyed 12,000 working children 
	on 73 different types of occupation.<br>
	We opened 40 schools for 2,000 students. A study on the socio-economic 
	problems of women in Viralimalai area in Pudukkottai District had been 
	conducted by the STEPS. The women folk of this area are involved in 
	prostitution for generations. The study was made on the request of the 
	District Superintendent of Police and the Study report with recommendations 
	was submitted to the Superintendent of Police, Pudukkottai. HELPLINE is one 
	section of Police Department which works for the Women functioning for the 
	past 2 years in Tamil Nadu. STEPS is responsible for looking into the cases 
	and complaints two days per week regularly on Tuesday and Friday. Also some 
	special cases are referred to our organization by helping for counseling, 
	investigating and recommending for future action. So far STEPS has 
	effectively handled 74 cases through help line. Moreover STEPS has provided 
	gender sensitization training to 2000 police officials in Tamil Nadu.<br>

	<b>Project Proposal: Construction of Muslim Women’s Mosque &amp; the Issues of 
	Muslim Women</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The position of Muslim 
	Women is very worse in India. They are in double-chained slavery first as 
	women and then as Muslim Women. Her sex and her religion curb her self – 
	confidence and her right to live with dignity, as a women and a human being. 
	Often the religious leaders and male scholars of Islam assure that Muslim 
	Women have more respect in their society than a Hindu or Christian women. 
	They argue that Islam accepts widow remarriages, right to divorce and access 
	to property. It might have been true during the prophet’s period, because 
	then women had free access to the mosques and also to the prophet’s abode to 
	clarify their doubts. But today, the mobility of Muslim Women’s is curbed 
	and they are suppressed at all levels. Indian Muslim Women suffer a lot 
	right from her childhood. Her basic right to education is denied in most of 
	the cases and illiteracy is high among them. Muslim men interpret the 
	religious tenets in the convenient manner to their advantage. Women are kept 
	behind dark purdahs and their life too is shrouded this darkness. As part of 
	Indian culture, Muslim Women has to pay huge dowry to get married against 
	the Islamic custom of paying ‘Mehar’ to the bride by the bridegroom. ‘Mehar’ 
	is a mere shibboleth while dowry is a widespread reality, accepted and 
	compulsory practice. Though widow remarriages and divorces are accepted in 
	Muslim Community, in reality, men do not practice it in-favor of their 
	women. Arranging one marriage and making it successful is a task of the 
	society. But whether Indian Muslim men are ready to marry widows and 
	divorcees is yet another questioning for which we have no answer. We have 
	cases Muslim women being sold to aged Arabs and what emerges from such cases 
	is that such practice was due to the lower status of Muslim Women in the 
	society. The voice of Muslim Women are stifled and there miseries are 
	shrouded in the dark rooms, their cry is deep down within themselves for 
	they are unorganized, marginalized and invisible to the outer world. 
	Moreover, Islam religion has its own Personal Laws known as Shariath Laws. 
	Muslim citizen should abide by the laws envisaged in Shariath. Hence 
	sometimes even the police personal hesitate to take up the cases of Muslim 
	women or men and they try to direct the cases to the respective jamaat.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Need for empowering Muslim Women : Economic, social and political 
	conditions of Muslim Women in India:</b><br>
	Women in India have historically been relegated to the back rows and denied 
	their share of rights. Muslim Women have to haul a double disability load 
	because of a biased interpretation of percepts within the Shariat 
	Perimeters. Their misery is compounded because they are excluded from the 
	Constitutional rights granted to all Indian (and all means all) if these 
	rights are seen as conflicting with their personal laws. Muslims as a 
	consequence are excluded from the operation of the law regulating the 
	personal life of the rest of the Indian citizens. Whether or not it happens 
	on the ground, at least the law for non Muslims is relative gender 
	sensitive. Non-Muslim Women Muslim Women Women have a life security to live 
	with her husband, as it is illegal to have a second wife while the first 
	wife is alive. Under the personal law Muslim men are left free to indulge in 
	polygamy. Muslim Women are living an insecure life. The prescribed legal 
	procedures for getting divorce are similar for both men and women, under the<br>
	constitution of India. The procedure for Muslim men is to say ‘talaq’ and 
	Muslim women is to say ‘kula’. The procedure to Talaq is very simple and men 
	use it for any reason, but for Muslim women, she can use it only under 
	certain specific conditions. Non-Muslim men when divorcing his wife after a 
	lengthy and often tortuous legal procedure, pay a substantial maintenance to 
	his wife for life. Muslim men Successfully avoids this by paying (or not 
	paying) a pittance during the Iddat period.<br>
	<font color="#800000">Women can enter into Temple and church to complete 
	their prayer. Muslim women are not allowed to enter into mosque.</font><font color="#0000FF">
	</font>Non Muslim women are free to approach police station for expressing 
	their problem Muslim women should approach the respective Jamaat through the 
	male members of her parent’s family and her voice is not heard while 
	enquiring her problem. Mobility of the women is not restricted (to go to 
	school, temple, friends’ house, and meet relatives or for recreation). If it 
	happens, it is only by the male members in her family who control her.
	<font color="#800000">The mobility of Muslim women is restricted in the name 
	of religion. The rights of Men and Women are same before the constitution of 
	India. Muslim men and women are controlled by the Personal Laws envisaged by 
	Shariath.</font> This has naturally raised a debate in the Muslim Community 
	as well as the civil society. The question is being raised whether to 
	maintain its identify, it is necessary for the Muslim society to persist 
	with such social practices, which in the modern society are unacceptable; 
	this is debated not only among the non-Muslim educated elite but among the 
	Muslim elite also.<br>
	Muslim women are questioning the ugly side of the pernicious practice of 
	triple Talaq and lack of provisions of maintenance after the Talaq. They 
	have realized and repeatedly expressed the need for organizing their voices 
	on a separate platform. Hence, a unanimous decision was taken by the Muslim 
	women that a separate mosque for Muslim women is required. To execute the 
	tasks of the construction of Mosque, a group of concerned Muslim women from 
	Tamil Nadu formed State Level Muslim Women Forum. 40 Muslim Women from Tamil 
	Nadu constitute this committee.<br>
	<b><br>
	Evolution of Muslim Women’s Forum / Jamaat Committee:</b><br>
	:<br>
	During the workshop conducted by STEPS for the Muslim women, Muslim Women 
	expressed the stories of the social oppression unleashed on them by their 
	own people. These women lamented the fact that the men, unabashedly taking 
	advantage of the distorted practices of the Islamic personal laws, deprived 
	them of the dignity so assiduously conferred on them by their religion and 
	left them alone to face the oppressive grind of daily lives. The outcome of 
	the discussion and sharing of Muslim women found direct relationship between 
	the abuse of personal law, and bruises of family violence and the women’s 
	lace of awareness. This abysmal ignorance was depriving them of their 
	personal rights and making them blind to and tolerant of abuse. One way was 
	to make them aware of the teachings of Islam and juxtapose them with the 
	man-made distortions which has acquired the aura of religious injunction. 
	This State Level Muslim Women Forum / Jamaat Committee would be involved in 
	the process of construction of Muslim Women’s Mosque through STEPS. Even 
	though the decision of construction of Mosque is revealed by STEPS, it is 
	the agenda of the Muslim women especially victimized Muslim women who want 
	their voice to be heard by the world. Through the Mosque, STEPS want to 
	create a space for the Muslim women. This mosque will fulfill all the basic 
	requirement of typical mosque in principle and in appearance. Prayers as 
	envisaged in Islam would be followed with the same ideology, of course with 
	the female Emam who is eligible to do the rituals. This mosque premises will 
	not only be a space for religious practices, it would address the issues of 
	Muslim women, provide education, training to Muslim women and children. 
	Destitute women can stay in the short stay home and equip themselves through 
	the skill development trainings and live independently with the help of the 
	support from Mosque. Hence a building with the appearance of the Mosque is 
	not the objective of STEPS. It would be strong enough to address the issues 
	of Muslim women, and provide solution not only in-terms of words but through 
	its other supportive activities for the empowerment of Muslim women. This 
	would not only strengthen the economic and social status of individual 
	Muslim women, but will create a political power in itself, which will 
	fulfill the needs of Muslim women. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Threats before us – the 
	present scenario:</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Initially the jamaat 
	representatives in Parambur village of Pudukottai, Tamil Nadu, India to 
	provide a plot on which the women mosque could be constructed. But when the 
	story broke in the press, they were threatened by Ulemas (Islamic religious 
	experts) from all over India, and help melted away. A woman is being 
	victimized, not only by physical violence, but also by character 
	assassination of the women which psychologically affect the women. The women 
	involved in the process of construction of mosque are subject to this 
	torture.&nbsp; <font color="#800000">Death threats are before STEPS from the 
	religious leaders, as if STEPS is engaged in un-Islamic practice, and 
	favoring other religion. Lives of Muslim women who want to engage in the 
	process of construction of the mosque are under pressure and STEPS need to 
	create hospice to them throughout their life time in the interest of the 
	Muslim community. This become an additional commitment of STEPS apart from 
	the mosque. Activities of STEPS towards Women Mosque are labeled as if STEPS 
	is under the pressure of some political party in favor of other religion.</font><font color="#0000FF">
	</font>Financial crisis faced by the STEPS team in the construction of the 
	mosque. Even though the members of STEPS can raise up to the heights of the 
	sky, their activities towards Women’s Mosque is restricted by the money 
	instrument. <br>
	<br>
	The Mosque will be an amalgamation of the following: </font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A short stay home for 
		the women who are in crisis and support them with legal 
		assistance.Provide education to the children of widower and separated

		<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Provide skill

	</ul>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Outcome of the Muslim 
	Women’s Mosque :</font></p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font size="2" face="Verdana">Muslim Women will be freed from the 
	cleric-controlled jamaats. Muslim Women will get a new social space within 
	the Muslim society. Number of one-sided Talaqs will be reduced. This mosque 
	will help propagate education and health among Muslim Women. Mosque will 
	help Muslim women to get together and vent their feelings. Internal control
