	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: Tell us something about your 
	background. How did you come to be involved in the Dalit-Bahujan struggle?
	</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: I was born in a village in a 
	forest area in the Warangal district of Andhra Pradesh. The entire area had 
	been given by the Nizam of Hyderabad to Mahbub Reddy, a local landlord, as 
	his fief. My family belongs to the sheep-grazing Kuruma Golla caste. They 
	had earlier migrated from Warangal proper to the forest belt. My grandmother 
	had settled the village. After her death my mother took over the leadership 
	of the caste. I was born three years after the Police Action in 1948. The 
	communists were then very active in our area. In the course of the Telengana 
	armed struggle they killed two people in our village—both were village 
	Patels. Because of the struggle, Mahbub Reddy began selling his lands off, 
	and our caste people, who, till then owned no land at all, began buying 
	small plots. So this was a time when the feudal system had begun 
	disintegrating. Later, at school I came into contact with Marxists, with 
	Marxist literature, and became involved in the students’ movement, and that 
	is how I got involved in the struggle for justice. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: What or who has been the major 
	influence on your thinking and your politics? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: The most important influence on 
	my life was the village in which I was born. As a child in the village I 
	learnt how to breed sheep, till the land and make ropes, but what was 
	particularly instructive was the interactions and contradictions between the 
	different castes within the village—Kurumas, Kapus, Gowdas and Madigas. And 
	it is this personal knowledge of the dynamics of caste that is central to my 
	thinking and all my writings. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My mother exercised a seminal 
	influence on my thinking, too. She was a strong woman and the leader of our 
	caste. You see, among the Dalit-Bahujans, women have an important role 
	within the family and the caste. They set the moral norms themselves, 
	through interaction with the productive process and in the process of 
	struggle with nature, unlike among the Hindus [Brahmins, Kshatriyas and 
	Banias], where women do not work in the fields, and whose norms are dictated 
	by an external agency—the Brahminical texts. My mother was in the forefront 
	of the struggle against the forest guards who would constantly harrass the 
	Kurumas and not allow them to graze their animals in the forest. In fact, 
	she died in one of these confrontations, being fatally beaten up by a 
	policeman while protesting against their brutality. She was then only 46 
	years old. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I’ve written a Telugu piece about my 
	mother. It’s called The Mother’s Efforts And Her Struggle. There I have 
	tried to show that it is not simply the big ‘political’ struggles against 
	the state which alone are important. Rather, one should look at everyday 
	struggles as well—in this case, a mother’s constant struggle to educate her 
	children, challenging patriarchy, struggling with nature in the productive 
	process, sustaining the culture of the caste. Most Marxist texts look only 
	at grand ‘political’ struggles, party mode of struggles, struggles led by 
	men. In my writings I have sought to also focus on micro struggles, the 
	stories of ordinary people, including women. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q:How would you characterise 
	contemporary Hindutva? What is the relationship between Hindutva and the 
	Dalit-Bahujans? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: As Dr.Ambedkar says, Hindutva is 
	nothing but Brahminism. And whether you call it Hindutva or Arya Dharma or 
	Sanatana Dharma or Hindusim, Brahminism has no organic link with 
	Dalit-Bahujan life, world-views, rituals and even politics. To give you just 
	one example, in my childhood many of us had not even heard of the Hindu 
	gods, and it was only when we went to school that we learnt about Ram and 
	Vishnu for the very first time. We had our own goddesses, such as Pochamma 
	and Elamma, and our own caste god, Virappa. They and their festivals played 
	a central role in our lives, not the Hindu gods. At the festivals of our 
	deities, we would sing and dance--men, women and all-- and would sacrifice 
	animals and drink liquor, all of which the Hindus consider ‘polluting’.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our relations with our deities were 
	transactional and they were rooted in the production process. For instance, 
	our goddess Kattamma Maisa. Her responsibility is to fill the tanks with 
	water. If she does it well, a large number of animals are sacrificed to her. 
	If in one year the tanks dry up, she gets no animals. You see, between her 
	and her Dalit-Bahujan devotees there is this production relation which is 
	central. Likewise, in the case of Virappa, the caste deity of the Kuruma 
	shepherds. His task is to ensure the well-being of the animals. If the flock 
	increases he is offered many sheep as a sacrifice, but if a disease strikes 
	the flock, he gets nothing. Our gods, like us, are productive beings. This 
	is not the case with the Brahminical deities, who have nothing to do with 
	the productive process, but are frozen in the scriptural texts as an 
	external agency. So you can see how the Dalit-Bahujan religion and 
	Brahminism are two distinct and mutually opposed religio-cultural 
	formations, two completely different religions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, many Dalit communities 
	preserve traditions of the Hindu gods being their enemies. In Andhra, the 
	Madigas enact a drama which sometimes goes on for five days. This drama 
	revolves around Jambavanta, the Madiga hero, and Brahma, the representative 
	of the Brahmins. The two meet and have a long dialogue. The central argument 
	in this dialogue is about the creation of humankind. Brahma claims 
	superiority for the Brahmins over everybody else, but Jambavanta says, ‘No, 
	you are our enemy’. Brahma then says that he created the Brahmins from his 
	mouth, the Kshatriyas from his hands, the Vaishyas from his thighs, the 
	Shudras from his feet to be slaves for the Brahmins, and of course the 
	Dalits, who fall out of the caste system, have no place here. This is the 
	Vedic story. But Jambavanta says that this is nonsense. He says that 
	prakriti [nature] created him and Shakti [the female power principle], and 
	through his union with Shakti, the trimurti [Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva] were 
	born. And then he goes on to say that although Brahma was born as his own 
	offspring, he has not been faithful to his way of life, and that is why the 
	Madigas have kept the Brahmins away from them. Here he talks about the 
	superiority of the Madiga way of life over the Brahminical--of beef-eating 
	over vegetarianism, of manual labour, working with leather and making shoes, 
	as opposed to a parasitic life of living off the labour of others. And then 
	Brahma is defeated, because he has no answer to give Jambavanta. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: And then what happens to 
	Brahma? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: That is most interesting. You 
	see, Jambavanta defeats him by argument, not by killing him. In the 
	Dalit-Bahujan tradition there is no defeat by killing your enemy, which is 
	so central to Brahminism, be it the Gita or the Puranas. This Dalit-Bahujan 
	tradition of overcoming your enemy through logical persuasion runs right 
	from the Buddha to Ambedkar. The understanding is that you must establish 
	your philosophical superiority and defeat the enemy on the moral ground.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: What you are perhaps 
	suggesting is that Dalit-Bahujan religion can be used to effectively counter 
	the politics of Brahminism or Hindutva. But Brahminism has this knack of 
	co-opting all revolt against it, by absorbing it within the system. </font>
	</b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: It is true that although 
	Dalit-Bahujan religious formations historically operated autonomously from 
	Hindu forms, they have never been centralised or codified. Their local gods 
	and goddesses have not been projected into universality, nor has their 
	religion been given an all-India name. This is because these local deities 
	and religious forms were organically linked to local communities, and were 
	linked to local productive processes, such as the case of Virappa and 
	Katamma Maisa whom I talked about earlier. But Brahminism has consistently 
	sought to subvert these religious forms by injecting notions of ‘purity’ and 
	‘pollution’, hierarchy and untouchability even among the Dalit-Bahujans 
	themselves, while at the same time discounting our religious traditions by 
	condemning them as ‘polluting’ or by Brahminising them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: Then would you say that 
	religious conversion to a major codified religion could be the way out of 
	the dilemma, as Ambedkar thought? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Historically, it was in the 
	struggle of the Dalit-Bahujans against the Hindu order, the Brahminical 
	system which had captured the state and used it as an instrument to impose 
	the caste ideology, that Dalit-Bahujans converted in large numbers to 
	Buddhism, Sikhism,Islam and Christianity. These were social protest 
	movements to gain social rights and self-respect. The whole Buddhist 
	phenomenon in our early history was a story of Dalit-Bahujan protest. The 
	Buddha says, ‘Just as various different streams flow into a river and become 
	one, so, too, the different castes, when they come into the sangha [ the 
	community of the Buddhist faithful], they join the sea of colourless water’. 
	This stress on social equality is, of course, in marked contrast with 
	Hinduism, which cannot be defined in terms of a universal religion with a 
	universal social rights’ concept. It is simply another name for oppression. 
	I have serious problems with Brahmin writers who say Hinduism is ‘a way of 
	life’. As I understand it, it is nothing but a means for exploitation of the 
	Dalit-Bahujans. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To get back to the point I was 
	making, conversion to Islam and Christianity was for many Dalit-Bahujans a 
	means for social liberation. In the medieval period, conversion to Islam 
	afforded some Dalit-Bahujans a means to enter political structures for the 
	first time. In fact, the whole Shudra emergence dates back to this period. 
	Akbar instituted what could be called a ‘reservation policy’ for Shudras in 
	landlholdings—groups such as Jats in north India or Reddys in Andhra. You do 
	not see Shudras as major landowners in the pre-Akbarian period. In the 
	entire period of Hindu rule, you have the agraharam sort of landholding 
	system, with Hindu kings donating vast tracts of lands to the Brahmins.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the colonial period, of course 
	there was massive economic plunder, but the Christian missionaries did a lot 
	for the Dalit-Bahujans—education, some amount of economic and social 
	mobility. Many Backward Castes which did not convert to Islam or, later, 
	Christianity, are suffering today, the reason being that there is no 
	educated elite among them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: But, then, does conversion 
	have any relevance today? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: My own feeling is that if the 
	Dalit-Bahujan movement proves unable to propel the Dalit-Bahujans to state 
	power and to place them in politically hegemonic spaces, educated 
	Dalit-Bahujans will increasingly look to religious conversion as a major 
	alternative as a means of mobilisation and protest. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Q: How do you see the demonisation 
	of Muslims and Christians in Hindutva propaganda? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: It is obvious that the real 
	threat that Brahminism faces is not from the Muslims or Christians but from 
	the growing awakening of the Dalit-Bahujans, who now refuse to accept 
	Brahminical supremacy. And that is why Dalit-Bahujan wrath is being craftily 
	sought to be displaced from their real oppressors onto imaginary enemies in 
	the form of Muslims and Christians. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Q: There’s been much talk about 
	Dalit-Bahujan-Muslim unity. What are your own views about this?</b> </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: It is important to remember that 
	Dalit-Bahujans and Muslims, particularly indigenous converts who form the 
	vast majority of the Muslim population, share much in common in terms of 
	culture. Both belong, in contrast to the Hindus, to a meat-eating culture, 
	and in a society where what you eat determines, in a very major way, your 
	social status, this is crucial. Then, Islam champions social equality, and 
	there is a total absence of the feeling of untouchability. Take a very 
	simple thing—the Hindu namaste, folding your hands to greet someone—is a 
	very powerful symbolic statement. It suggests that I recognise you but you 
	should not touch me. In contrast, the custom that the Christians introduced 
	of shaking of hands is a touching relationship, while the Muslims go even 
	further and physically embrace you. Even today in the villages the Muslims 
	are the only people who actually physically embrace the Dalit-Bahujans. Of 
	course, the Brahmins and Banias don’t let them do that to them, but that’s a 
	different matter. You must remember that the human embrace is itself a very 
	liberating symbolic act for the Dalit-Bahujan victims of Brahminism. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There’s a lot else that 
	Dalit-Bahujans share with Muslims. Scores of Dalit-Bahujans continue to 
	participate in the Muharram rituals and visit Sufi dargahs. Further, in the 
	productive process the bulk of the Muslims find themselves in the same 
	position as most Dalit-Bahujans, as peasants, agricultural labourers, as 
	cobblers, weavers and so on, and in that capacity they share a common 
	culture. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: But can mere cultural 
	similarity or commonality serve as a platform for a wider political unity 
	between Dalit-Bahujans and Muslims? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: My point is that we urgently need 
	to explore and expand these spaces of cultural unity, and only on that basis 
	can political unity come about. Brahminism or Hindutva or call it what you 
	like, seeks to deny this unity, and plays up only on the differences. We, on 
	the other hand, must focus on the elements of unity, and try to expand these 
	sites of unified life into the political domain. Because of our faulty 
	western Marxist methodological training, we start from political unity, 
	straight away trying to unite Dalit-Bahujans and Muslims on the political 
	plane, without an appropriate cultural back-up. And then when attempts at 
	political unity fail, you give up. I feel that this is not the way of doing 
	the job. You must start by exploring existing sites of cultural unity as 
	well as what could be called productive unity, unity that follows from 
	Muslims and Dalit-Bahujans being placed in similar or common niches in the 
	broader productive process. Build up this consciousness of social and 
	cultural unity and then a lasting political unity will easily come about.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: What role do you see 
	Dalit-Bahujan spiritualities as playing in all of this? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: Let me begin by saying that 
	Brahminism is more afraid of the Dalit-Bahujan thought process than of 
	political challenge. It can manipulate or even kill off any number of 
	Eklavyas or Shabukas, but it cannot face the challenge of Ambedkarite 
	thought. They may conspire to kill me off, but they can’t do a thing with my 
	book [Why I Am Not A Hindu]. And it is in this realm of the cultural that 
	Dalit-Bahujan organic intellectuals have a lot to do. We need to retrieve 
	and revive our own histories, traditions, cultures, religions and knowledge 
	systems, all of which are organically connected, in contrast to the 
	Brahminical, with the productive economic process, with the dignity of 
	labour. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: But here you seem to be 
	assuming that Dalit-Bahujan traditions have remained static. Is it not the 
	case that they, too, have fallen victim to the process of Brahminical 
	co-optation? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: I think the process operates both 
	ways, and there is a major way in which Hindu structures themselves are 
	getting Dalitised, which has not been written about. Take, for instance, the 
	Ganapati festival. Earlier the festival was centred around the Brahmin 
	priest, but now most of those who participate in the festival are probably 
	Dalit-Bahujans. And no longer is the festival Brahminical in the classical 
	sense. With the Dalitisation of the festival has come dancing, drinking and 
	singing and loud filmi music! To take another example, some Dalit-Bahujans 
	are demanding that prayers be said in the temples not in Sanskrit but in the 
	languages of the people themselves and that they, too, should be allowed to 
	become priests. Whatever one might otherwise say about this, this is a means 
	to challenge Brahnminism from within its own structures, a process of 
	Dalitisation whose ultimate culmination can only be the destruction of 
	Brahminism. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: Do you see what you call the 
	Dalitisation process operating in other spheres as well? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: This is evident everywhere—the 
	fact that a Brahmin doctor is willing to treat a Dalit patient is a 
	reflection of this process, as is the willingness of a Brahmin woman to 
	divorce her husband or smoke and drink in public or a Brahmin widow going in 
	for another marriage. You must remember that smoking and drinking , divorce 
	and remarriage have never been problems for Dalit-Bahujan women, in contrast 
	to Brahmin women, so all this is nothing but Dalitisation in action. 
	M.N.Srinivas and other Brahmin sociologists wanted to bolster Brahminical 
	hegemony by claiming that India is getting Sanskritised. But when we asked 
	them what is all this surge in drinking and smoking and women’s emancipation 
	all about, they said it was Westernisation, when actually it is nothing but 
	Dalitisation. Of course, they do not want to admit that because that will 
	mean recognising that it is from the Dalit-Bahujans that others are 
	learning. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My point is very simple. If you go 
	on saying that India is getting Dalitised, Brahminism will die a natural 
	death, but if you keep harping on the theme of India getting Hinduised 
	Brahminism will gain added strength. So many books were written in the wake 
	of the Babri Masjid affair selling the argument that India is getting 
	Hinduised. But where were all these historians and sociologists when ten 
	lakh Dalits converted to Buddhism in 1956 along with Dr. Ambedkar? Did they 
	then say that India was getting Dalitised or Buddhistised? Had they done so 
	we would have had a very different history today. So, I say, write history 
	from the point of view of the Dalits, showing how while Sanskrisation and 
	Brahminism are historically unproductive, a burden on the system and a 
	legitimation for exploitation, Dalitisation, in contrast, is historically a 
	productive, creative and constructive process because it is rooted in the 
	dignity of labour. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: How would you envisage this 
	project of writing Indian history from the point of view of Dalit-Bahujans 
	as subjects, as the central actors? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: To be honest, I am seriously 
	opposed to the writing of what is called the ‘history of sorrow’—simply 
	narrating all the oppression and sufferings that the Dalit-Bahujans have had 
	to suffer under Brahminism, although that, too, cannot be ignored. But I 
	feel that the more you cry, the more the enemy beats you. If you want to 
	defeat the enemy, you cannot remain contented with merely critiquing him, 
	because even in that case he is the one who sets the terms of discourse and 
	you are playing the game according to the rules that he devises, so 
	naturally it is he and not you who wins in the end. Thus, rather than dwell 
	simply on our historical oppression or the dangers of Hindu fascism, keep 
	the focus on the process of Dalitisation, and thereby set the terms of 
	discourse and debate yourself. For that you have to present a Dalit-Bahujan 
	alternative as a workable and better solution. If you don’t do so, and 
	restrict yourself to simply criticisng Brahminism by quoting slokas from one 
	Brahminical text or the other, they will put forward yet another sloka to 
	disprove you. But if you write from the Dalit point of view they have no way 
	to rebut what you want to say. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Central to that task would be 
	re-writing Dalit-Bahujan history to show, for instance, their knowledge 
	systems, their role in the productive process, their great contributions to 
	the development of technology or in the realm of spirituality or how their 
	societies afford women a much higher status than the Brahminic. Sati and 
	dowry have historically been specifically Hindu problems never ours. So 
	history re-writing will have to be informed with Dalit pride. You have to 
	show that Dalitisation, and not Hinduisation, is the answer to our ills, 
	because unlike Brahminism, which is rooted in texts that do not spring from 
	real-world experience in the productive process, Dalitisation reflects the 
	interaction of human beings with nature in the labour process. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Unless you present Dalitisation as a 
	superior alternative, you can’t win the battle. Take the Buddha, for 
	instance. His greatest contribution was not his critique of Brahminism, 
	important though that was, but his founding of the egalitarian community of 
	the faithful—the sangha—as a superior alternative to Brahminical caste 
	society. Or take Marx for that matter. To my mind, his greatness lies not so 
	much in his critique of capitalism but in his presenting a superior 
	alternative in the form of a communist society. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: Have you attempted anything of 
	this sort yourself? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: I think you can see this in most 
	of my writings. To give but one example, I wrote this piece on the 
	leather-working Madigas titled ‘The Subaltern Scientists’ and another piece 
	on the Madiga Dalits called ‘The Productive Soldiers’. Presently, I am 
	working on a book dealing with the discoveries and inventions of certain 
	Dalit-Bahujan tribes and castes. There’s so much to be done to recover 
	Dalit-Bahujan knowledge systems. I mean, for instance, you would have to 
	trace industrialisation in India not to Lancashire but to the Madiga wadas 
	[localities], where the Madigas first perfected the art of turning raw 
	leather into shoes, or to our barbers who invented the knife. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Q: One last question. What made 
	you give your book the title Why I Am Not A Hindu? How was the book 
	received? </font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A: I thought it was important for 
	Dalit-Bahujans to make a powerful statement against the Hindutva propaganda 
	that we, too, are Hindus. As for how the book was received, well, 
	Dalit-Bahujans, of course, were very excited about it. Predictably, orthodox 
	Brahmins were angry, but so too were some ‘socialist’ Brahmins. Actually, 
	that did not surprise me at all, because they read Marx’s Capital just as 
	they read the Vedas—reciting it—not a critical reading. But I did get quite 
	a few responses from Brahmins in Tamil Nadu They wrote to say that they had 
	read a lot of Periyar, but he had only criticised them but never told them 
	where they had gone wrong. They said that it was after reading Why I Am Not 
	A Hindu that they discovered what was wrong with their religion and culture 
	and how they must change if they are to survive.</font></p>
