          <td colSpan="2" width="540"><font face="Arial" size="2">As the 
          well-known journalist
          <a href="http://www.asiapacificms.com/articles/" target="_blank">
          Bertil Lintner</a> wrote, &quot;According to a foreign diplomat in Dhaka, 
          ‘In the 1960s and 1970s, it was the leftists who were seen as 
          incorruptible purists. Today, the role model for many young men in 
          rural areas is the dedicated Islamic cleric with his skull cap, 
          flowing robes and beard.’&quot;
          <p>Life has become grim for rural leftists today. In the past few 
          months, leftists are being hunted down by a notorious Islamist gang 
          leader in west and northwest Bangladesh, a religious fanatic called
          <a target="_blank" href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/news/bangla_bhai/">
          Bangla Bhai</a>. The leftists being hunted are villagers belonging to 
          various factions, the most well-known of which is the Purba Banglar 
          Communist Party (PBCP), or Sarbahara group. </p>
          <p>As recently reported in <i>Frontline</i> magazine (June 19-July 02, 
          2004, article by Haroon Habib writing from Dhaka), mostly Bangla 
          language newspapers report that Bangla Bhai’s men levy protection 
          tolls on villagers, order them to wear <i>tupi</i> (cap), go to mosque 
          regularly, and force women to wear <i>burqa</i> or hijab. Those who 
          defy in any way are subjected to physical abuse and/or their property 
          is wasted. </p>
          <p>Bangla Bhai’s cadres identify &quot;anti-social elements&quot; as they define 
          it and mete out vigilante justice. They usually kill their victims in 
          gruesome ways and often mutilate their bodies. In the last week of 
          May, one of the three supposedly Left extremists caught by Bangla 
          Bhai’s operatives was beaten to death and hanged upside down from a 
          roadside tree in Bogra. </p>
          <p>The main Dhaka newspapers deny such goings on, and the government 
          of Khaleda Zia pretends that the police have been notified to capture 
          him. However, in four northwestern districts—Rajshahi, Naogaon, Natore 
          and Bogra—police are collaborating with this gang and justify what 
          they do by saying they are undermanned and cannot control all the 
          criminal elements. Not only does the government turn a blind eye, P.M. 
          Begam Zia also appointed a Jama’ati as the Agriculture Minister, thus 
          ensuring Islamist influence and a free rein for Bangla Bhai and other 
          Islamist forces in the rural areas.</p>
          <p>Bangla Bhai has an MA from Rajshahi University, and he’s not 
          stupid. He launched his organisation Jagrota Muslim Janata Bangladesh 
          (JMJB) on April 1, 2004, and claims that the group by now commands 
          three lakh activists across the country. &quot;Our goal is to root out 
          Sarbahara men and corruption from society, seize illegal weapons and 
          establish the ideal of the Rasul (Prophet Hazrat Mohammed (SA),&quot; he 
          recently told Hasibur Rahman Bilu, Borga correspondent of <i>The Daily 
          Star</i>. Thus, secularists growing increasing anguished at what has 
          happened to their Sonar Bangladesh, now see this gang operator as the 
          instigator of Talebanisation in the entire country.</p>
          <p>It is well known by now that until Bangla Bhai appeared, eastern 
          Bangladesh—areas around Sylhet, Comilla, Chittagong and Teknaf—in 
          particular had become the main hotbed of jihadism, terrorist training 
          camps (see the various articles by Bertil Lintner), and 
          anti-secularism. Much has been written on these developments, but so 
          far none of the published material has ever provided grass-roots 
          evidence of where public opinion, the views of the <i>chhoto lok</i>, 
          stand. Yet these are the very people the jihadis and worse are so 
          successful in organizing. </p>
          <p><img src="osama_rikshaw_200_040728.jpg" align="left" width="200" height="305">Thus, it 
          behooves analysts to take a look at the <i>ricksha</i>s, an important 
          source of visual revelations on public opinion. <i>Ricksha</i> 
          pictures tend to be ignored by the gentry as vulgar and not art, but 
          my years of research on <i>ricksha</i> art have shown me all too 
          clearly what the common man in the streets has on his mind.The gentry 
          ignore him at their peril. </p>
          <p>To illustrate my point, here are some photos, shot by a young 
          Bangladeshi, Shaon, a few months ago in the town of Comilla.One 
          picture shows Saddam. The last time Saddam Husain appeared in <i>
          ricksha</i> art, that I know about, was on Dhaka <i>ricksha</i>s 
          around the first Gulf War. I unfortunately was not able to visit 
          Comilla at that time to see what they were painting on their <i>
          ricksha</i>s, but I would not be surprised if Saddam was depicted. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><img src="osama_saddam_040728.jpg" align="centre" width="370" height="250"> </p>
          <p>In one photo we see both Bin Laden and Saddam, &quot;together at last&quot; 
          (I say that sardonically, as the Bush policy in the US is that he and 
          Saddam were connected, whereas all expert analysis says otherwise). 
          Bin Laden is the main hero, and one of the paintings of him bears a 
          call to self immolation in jihad.</p>
