					<font size="2">Who is he?</font> </span></h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Sanat Kumar 
					Paul was an unorganised sector worker in 1992. He worked at 
					the ECCO Battery Ltd. of 73 Belgachhia Road Kolkata 700037. 
					He was one of the five workers employed in this lead 
					battery-manufacturing unit. He received Rs. 876 (gross) per 
					month. There was no ESI coverage for workers. There were 
					several lead battery-manufacturing units under the same 
					roof.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">What did he do at his 
					workplace?</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Sanat had to 
					handle various chemicals in powder form. He had to knead 
					them with his bare hands and then spread it out in the form 
					of a plate. These plates were then dried and charged to make 
					the structural units of large lead batteries. There was lead 
					in the powder and paste he had to handle. This is a 
					hazardous process as per Factories Act, 1948. Workers at 
					ECCO Battery Ltd were neither given any personal protective 
					equipment nor told about any hazards while at work.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Sanat gets affected 
					and seeks treatment</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">After working 
					for 3 years, he started facing problems. Lonely and hapless 
					he thought he needed medical attention. There was no state 
					run Occupational Disease Detection Centre in West Bengal. He 
					started by consulting general practitioners. Then somebody 
					told him about Peerless Hospital. It was very costly for 
					him. Yet, he was on the right track. Then he met experts at 
					Bangur Institute of Neurology, School of Physical Medicine, 
					and ESI Hospital Manicktala. It was then confirmed around 
					June 1995 that Sanat had contracted an occupational disease. 
					&nbsp;</span></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">What was his problem?</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">He found his 
					hands and fingers loosing strength. He could not hold a 
					glass of water when the problem started. Progressively he 
					lost control of his fingers and palms, which were as if 
					paralysed. The hands dropped absolutely limp from wrist 
					downward. The disease he had contracted was 'lead 
					neuropathy'.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">What is Lead 
					Neuropathy?</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Lead 
					neuropathy is a neurological disorder caused by lead 
					poisoning. This is caused when exposed to dangerously high 
					levels of lead. The symptoms are blue lines on the gums and 
					'bi-lateral wrist drop'. Lead Neuropathy is included in 
					Schedule III of Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 and 
					Factories Act, 1948. It is a notifiable disease for which 
					compensation is payable to the victim.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">What is Wrist Drop?</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">'Wrist drop, 
					also known as

					<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">

					<a title="Pronated" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronated">
					<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">

					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">How did his employers 
					react?</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">When informed, 
					Sanat's employer immediately terminated his job on 1 July 
					1995. There was not even a show cause letter. He had never 
					been given an appointment letter in the past. His real fault 
					was his inability to continue with his job because he had no 
					strength in his hand. The employer thought that he had no 
					responsibility though Sanat had picked up this disability 
					from his workplace. So Sanat was fired and someone else 
					probably got hired. &nbsp;</span></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Negotiations, disputes 
					and appeals</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">He requested 
					his employer for the actual medical expenses and its was 
					refused. Repeated verbal requests for redeployment in a 
					lighter job were refused too. Even his registered letters 
					were refused. He informed his union in writing. In September 
					1995, he raised a dispute with the Assistant Labour 
					Commissioners. Three tri-partite meetings over almost a year 
					yielded no results. Sanat wrote to the Labour Minister too, 
					but that too in vain. &nbsp;</span></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Sanat Paul's case in 
					Supreme Court Matter</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="2">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">In the 
					meantime his case was cited in the report on occupational 
					disease in eleven industries submitted to the Supreme Court 
					by Nagarik Mancha in July 1995. The Supreme Court directed 
					the Government of West Bengal to look into the incidence if 
					lead poisoning among workers of ECCO Battery. The concerned 
					Medical Inspector under the Chief Inspector of Factories, 
					West Bengal visited the factory premise on 27 May 1996 and 
					found a lockout notice of the same date displayed. The main 
					door was locked but there were clear signs of industrial 
					activity going on inside. Sanat was examined by the said 
					Medical Inspector at the latter's office and distinct 
					symptoms of Lead Neuropathy was detected. The said report 
					was duly sent to the Supreme Court. Sanat's plight was 
					reported in many dailies but nothing seemed to happen.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: normal">&nbsp;
					</span></font></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Sanat at the Workmen's 
					Compensation Court</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="2">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">As a last 
					resort, Sanat lodged a case at the Court of the Commissioner 
					of the Workmen's Compensation, West Bengal in August 1997. 
					For more than two years, the case was not heard for one 
					reason or the other. At times the Courts had no judges. In 
					the second phase, the employer refused to accept the summons 
					of the court. Next, the errant proprietor failed repeatedly 
					to appear in Court. During mid-2000 the hearing finally 
					started. Witnesses including doctors in Government 
					organisations appeared on behalf of Sanat on 29 November 
					2000.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
					<h3><font size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Sanat awarded 
					compensation</span></font></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify"><font size="2">
					<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">Finally on 20 
					September 2001 Hon'ble Justice H M Ghatak, Commissioner for 
					Workmen's Compensation, West Bengal, observed that &quot;The 
					evidence… taken together with the documents…proves that the 
					petitioner was suffering from occupational disease due to 
					lead neuropathy and the petitioner had contracted such 
					occupational disease while working at the manufacturing unit 
					of the opposite parties. According to Item No. 3 of Part II 
					of Schedule III of Workmen's Compensation Act, the 
					petitioner is entitled to get compensation at the rate of 
					100% loss of earning capacity for his occupational disease.&quot; 
					Based on the above Sanat Paul was awarded compensation 
					amounting to Rs. 95,690 to be deposited in the Court by the 
					Proprietor of M/s ECCO Battery Ltd.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

					<p style="font-style: italic"><font size="2">
					<span lang="EN-GB">We met Sanat twelve years back. He was

					with us. Since then he has been with us and we have tried to 
					stay by his side.</span></font></p>
					<p style="font-style: italic"><font size="2">
					<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;In 1996 Sanat was not alone. There were 
					scores of occupational disease patients we had 'found'.&nbsp; The 
					Supreme Court had directed Nagarik Mancha to submit a report 
					on the status of occupational disease in West Bengal. We did 
					our bit. Today most of those and hundreds of other 
					occupational disease patients are being compensated by ESI 
					as per law. An infrastructure has developed from scratch and 
					we did a little pushing and shoving as and when needed. 
					However Sanat is still languishing since he was not covered 
					by the ESI. Sanat was from the unorganised sector and was 
					hence unprotected!</span></font></p>
					<p style="font-style: italic"><font size="2">
					<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;Unprotected workers were supposed to 
					move the Court of Commissioner for Workmen's Compensation, 
					West Bengal. Strangely for the last 84 years of the 
					existence of the Workmen's Compensation Act (1923) not a 
					single workmen had been compensated for occupational 
					disease. Sanat was and is hence the first case of its kind.
					</span></font></p>
					<p style="font-style: italic"><font size="2">
					<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;Nagarik Mancha wrote letters to his

					Commissioner, West Bengal, other relevant authority and 
					negotiated on his behalf when necessary; pursued the case at 
					Supreme Court, Court of Commissioner for Workmen's 
					Compensation, West Bengal, High Court at Kolkata, discussed 
					the matter with doctors, lawyers and officials. All expenses

					<p style="font-style: italic"><font size="2">

					recourse to a common falsehood, which is an 'open secret'. 
					When they apprehend that the order may go against them they 
					do the 'needful' so that their factories become non-existent

					while business goes on as usual. This is a known method of 
					shrugging off responsibility. Court orders cannot be served 
					since the employer becomes 'untraced' officially. The Court 
					administration knows about it but is 'helpless'; a section 
					of the postal department is a part of the nexus; the workers 
					suffer; but the errant employers pay appropriately to remain 
					'untraced' but factually remain very much in business.
