												The Road to Glory?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
												by Audrey Manning </p>
												</font>
												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												<p align="justify">Last week, 
												Cardinal Marc Ouellet the 
												archbishop of Quebec City issued 
												a widespread apology in which he 
												asked Quebecers to forgive the 
												Church for past errors. The 
												Cardinal's heart may be in the 
												right place but the mea culpa is 
												being met by widespread 
												skepticism. Some believe it is a 
												prelude to a campaign to restore 
												religious instruction in 
												schools.</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												Around the same time as pundits 
												were discussing the impact of 
												Ouellet's apology, two prominent 
												television evangelists were 
												expounding the virtues of the 
												Old Testament's Kind David. In 
												their view, David is a role 
												model.</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												Surprisingly, my first encounter 
												with the less than virtuous side 
												of King David was in church. A 
												Sunday school teacher and her 
												students put off a re-enactment 
												of the story of David and 
												Goliath. The teacher used a huge 
												cardboard cutout figure to 
												represent the Philistine giant, 
												Goliath. In church, a young 
												child, playing the role of 
												David, kills Goliath with a 
												slingshot.<br>
												<br>
												True to the Sunday school skit, 
												the Bible says David kills 
												Goliath with his slingshot, 
												beheads him and carries his head 
												back to Jerusalem. David is 
												chosen and anointed by Samuel to 
												replace Saul while Saul is still 
												king. Then David and Saul enter 
												into a competition to see who 
												can kill the most people for 
												God.</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												When they return from the 
												slaughter, the women meet them 
												singing and dancing saying, 
												&quot;Saul has killed thousands and 
												David tens of thousands.&quot; (1 
												Samuel 18: 6.7). David has won 
												hands down! Thus begins a 
												running battle for supremacy 
												between David and Saul.</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												David kills 200 Philistines and 
												takes their foreskins to pay 
												Saul for his daughter who 
												becomes David's first of eight 
												wives and numerous concubines. 
												Saul has asked for only one 
												hundred foreskins but was 
												secretly hoping that the 
												Philistines would kill David in 
												battle. Saul obviously does not 
												relish the idea of David's 
												replacing him as king (1 Samuel 
												18: 25-27).</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												Believing the Lord has told him 
												to go and smite the Philistines, 
												David smites them with great 
												slaughter (1 Samuel 2-5). Then 
												comes a strange vow… David vows 
												to kill any that pisseth against 
												the wall (1 Samuel 25: 22, 34). 
												As well, David smote the land 
												and left neither man nor woman 
												alive (1 Samuel 27: 8-11).</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												2 Samuel continues in the same 
												vein. Simple killing, as in 2 
												Samuel1: 15; David's bestowing 
												the curse of venereal disease, 
												leprosy and starvation on 
												families, as outlined in 2 
												Samuel 3: 27-29. David has the 
												assassins of Saul's son killed 
												by chopping off their hands and 
												feet and hanging up their bodies 
												for the Lord (2 Samuel 4: 6-7). 
												David has Uriah killed so that 
												he can have Uriah's wife 
												Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12: 14-18).</p>
												<p align="justify">To appease 
												God and end the famine that was 
												caused by his predecessor Saul, 
												David agrees to have seven of 
												Saul's sons killed and hung up 
												&quot;unto the Lord&quot; (2 Samuel 
												21:6-9) and then there is the 
												phrase, &quot;He teacheth my hands to 
												war.&quot; (2 Samuel 22:35). There is 
												more violence in the David story 
												but this may be enough to 
												illustrate that King David's 
												life was composed of war, sex 
												and strife. He was an example of 
												manhood to which macho men 
												aspire. David was courageous in 
												battle and a fearless leader but 
												he was also a prolific womanizer 
												and probably bisexual (2 Samuel 
												1: 17-27).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify">People 
												searching for meaning look to 
												the bible for reassurance. They 
												find it in the form of 
												forgiveness of sins no matter 
												how egregious. Individuals who, 
												deep in their hearts, believe 
												that they are rotten to the 
												core, because of original sin, 
												can look to the story of David 
												and see a man who was favored by 
												God in spite of all the victims 
												that he left strewn on the road 
												to glory.</p>
												<p align="justify">In this 
												story, the victims are merely a 
												footnote in history. Being able 
												to take charge and kill 
												indiscriminately seems to be a 
												necessary characteristic for a 
												king/leader. When Saul chooses 
												not to kill indiscriminately, 
												Samuel replaces him with David, 
												who has proven his mettle.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify">Church 
												leaders tell us to look to the 
												great killers and philanderers 
												of the Bible as role models. At 
												the same time, we wonder why the 
												church doesn't repent, straying 
												clergy don't seem too stressed, 
												humans devalue sex and youth are 
												confused and violent?</p>
												<p align="justify">As well as 
												being a man of action, David is 
												credited with writing the 
												Psalms, in particular the 23rd 
												Psalm. In contemplating David's 
												life, it's difficult to image 
												that a man who abuses power so 
												indiscriminately can find the 
												place of deeper well-being, and 
												the joy of which he writes.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify">Yet, that's 
												exactly what televangelists say 
												of David. His life brought him 
												to a place of deep joy, which is 
												taken to mean that if we act 
												like King David we, too, can 
												find joy. Could they be right? 
												For David's famous Psalm says, 
												&quot;Surely goodness and mercy will 
												follow me all the days of my 
												life and I will dwell in the 
												house of the Lord forever&quot;. The 
												question: where does this leave 
												all the discarded humans on the 
												glory road? </p>
