  <p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">Recently both the liberals and the islamists
  have taken on the USA on the Abu Gharib prison issue demonizing USA, calling
  the Abu Gharib prisoner abuse a manifestation of &quot;American Barabarism&quot;,
  calling America a monster. Some Islamists have condemned it as Western
  pornography and what not. There is a double standard or hypocrisy on the part
  of both the liberals and the Islamists who have made too much of these
  prisoner abuse and made a blanket characterization by using such expressions
  as &quot;American&quot; barbarism&quot;, &quot;American pornography&quot; etc.
  The fact is that Bush or Rumsfeld is right when they say that these prisoner
  abuse does not represent &quot;U.S.&quot;. What they don't say is that it
  represents &quot;US&quot; (i.e THEM). Bush-Chenney-Rumsfeld-Wolfowitz is not =
  Amercia(U.S). They don't deserve any credit for contributing to the great, nor
  should &quot;America&quot; get the blame for the acts of these NeoCons.
  American values and institutions that have been built over centuries initiated
  by the founding fathers. Instead they are undermining it, or abusing it. So it
  is irresponsible to use expressions like &quot;American barabarism&quot; to
  describe the prison abuse or call America a monster like Jamat is. These are
  immature and hasty characterizations not expected of any knowledgeable
  liberal. To equate the century old American institution built on democracy,
  secularism and human rights with Jamat is the height of ignorance and
  stupidity. Jamat may at best be equated to the NeoCons who have been
  controlling US policy since the days of Nixon. NeoCons may be in control but
  they certainly have not contributed to the American value and institutions
  built over the last two centuries. NeoCons are not = America. It is also
  immature to only characterize Jamat as the monster as if Islamic
  fundamentalism is = Jamat. Even if Jamat is exterminated today there are 20
  other extreme Islamic organizations in Bangladesh who will be unharmed and
  intact and islamic fundamentalism will continue to grow and flourish. It is
  one thing to call for the trial of Jamat for its past role in 1971 killing of
  intellectuals and another to blame Islamic fundamentalism on Jamat alone.
  Islamic fundamentalism is rooted in the fundamentals of Islam.</span>
  <p>What did these bleeding heart liberals and Islamists say when half a
  million children died due to the sanctions imposed by US on Iraq during the
  1990's? Is the torture of a few Iraqi prisoner much worse than the slow,
  painful and deliberate killing of hundreds of thousands of children brought
  about by cruel sanctions? (On May 27, 1996, CBS 60 minutes' Leslie Stahl asked
  the then secretary of state Madeline Albright whether the 1/2 million death of
  children by US sanctions was worth it, she said yes).
  <p>These liberals were cheering on Bush when Iraq as invaded, joining in the
  chorus with the neocons that Saddam is a monster, Hitler and what not,
  thumping their feet and complimenting the US for taking on an
  &quot;Islamic&quot; terrorist, which only shows their ignorance about Saddam
  and Iraq's history. Saddam was never an Islamic terrorists, but was instead
  the enemy of Islamic fundamentalism. (See <a href="http://www.the7thfire.com/Politics%20and%20History/LiesIraq.html">http://www.the7thfire.com/Politics%20and%20History/LiesIraq.html</a>
  )
  <p>During the first Iraq war, a water treatment plant near was destroyed by US
  during the first invasion, but US refused all request by &quot;Iraqi
  authorities&quot; for lifting sanctions blocking import of spare parts to
  repair the water supply plant. As a consequence of that thousands of children
  suffered from diseases and died. Where were the bleeding Islamists then? It
  was the infidel Amercians (Veterans for Peace organization(VFP), headed by
  Larry Kerschener and Phil Steger) who felt the pain for these children and
  tried to do something about it or at least to draw attention of the world.
  Please look at the link:
  <p><a href="http://www.afsc.org/pwork/1000/102k14.htm">http://www.afsc.org/pwork/1000/102k14.htm</a>
  <p>(The placard says Weapons of Mass destruction: Nuclear bomb in 1945 :
  110,000, Sanctions on Iraq: 1000,000)
  <p>Now who is the monster here, Saddam?, who requested spare parts for the
  water treatment plant to save the ordinary Iraqis, or the US administration,
  who refused to allow Iraq to import the spare parts knowing that it will hurt
  children and other ordinary Iraqis?
  <p>We also haven't heard any bleeding heart liberal and islamists talk about
  the &quot;Highway of Death&quot;. This is the most heinous inhuman crime
  committed by the Bush-1 regime. Tens of thousands of fleeing Iraqi soldiers
  were shot at from above by US planes like shooting birds. This horrifying act
  was committed even after Iraq surrendered and was withdrawing from Kuwait.
  These poor ordinary Iraqi soldiers were fleeing for their lives and were shot
  at inside Iraqi territory, not in Kuwait even.

  <p>It is silly and hypocritical (Like Penny Wise Pound Foolish) to make too
  much of the prison abuse to vilify &quot;America&quot;, but keep silent about
  the two historical crimes on the Iraqi people on such a massive scale by the
  NeoCon controlled US administration.
