  of us just get irritated if some secular writer&nbsp;mention in his article-&nbsp;
  &quot;This book X is a hoax&quot; or &quot;The character of Mr. Y is not at
  all prophetic&quot; (even though the writer always provides&nbsp;references
  from authentic sources); and&nbsp;he/she immediately termed as
  &quot;religion-basher&quot;/ non-secular. However, is there any conflict of
  being &quot;secular&quot; as well as &quot;bashing&quot; religion? Many of us
  (at least one here) think affirmatively. Some secular writers are always being
  accused of bashing&nbsp; &quot;specific&quot; religion; some others are being
  accused of not being &quot;constructive&quot; enough in their criticism. This
  is really problematic for those writers.</font></p>
  <p>But my argument is whether there is any definite rules/regulation/format so
  that we can judge a criticism as &quot;constructive&quot;? I tone my voice
  with fatemolla - &quot;Experience says, history says…No&quot;.&nbsp; The
  whole issue is a subjective one and the taste of &quot;constructiveness&quot;
  varies from person to person.</p>
  <p>One may easily note from his/her soul-searching that what the&nbsp;
  &quot;ignorant-bashers&quot;&nbsp;writing today in NFB is nothing new
  basically, - those were actually written many years ago in the west in
  Christian society (in some cases more harsher languages than Taslima/AK/SKM
  were used). For example, the great Humanist Thomas Paine once uttered about
  Bible -&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;...The Bible is a book lies, wickedness and Blasphemy. As for the
    book called Bible, it is actually blasphemy to call it the word of god.
    ...This book is <font color="#ff0000">too ridiculous even for criticism</font>&quot;
    ( Ref. The age of reason; Thomas Paine, p 88).&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;Ancient Charbakas criticized Vedas as &quot;bull-shit&quot;. James
  Harvey Johnson wrote about Bible&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;We see nothing worthwhile in this book. <font color="#ff0000">It is
    most evil, injurious, fallacious, divisive book ever written</font>. It has
    caused more deaths, tortures and suffering than any other book ever written.
    It has been the most oft-used instrument for holding back human progress for
    thousand years. It has been the cause of more wars than any other book or
    tyrant or human characteristic&quot; (Ref. 'Of the bible', James Harvey
    Johnson, The New Zealand Rationalist Humanist, vol XXXV)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Bertrand Russell also attacked Bible in more or less similar tone in many
  of his articles. No body had saught head for Russell, Harvey, or Pane. None
  were accused for not being &quot;constructive&quot; enough in their criticism.
  Now, may I ask humbly why do SKM/Abul Kasem&nbsp;have to be different?&nbsp;
  Is that because they are criticizing Islam?</p>
  <p>If so, then one might admit&nbsp;that problem is not in Abul Kasem's
  writing, problem actually lies in intolerant nature of the mindset of the
  followers of that specific religion that is being criticized.</p>
  <p>Islam, specially, according to many,&nbsp;has no culture accepting
  criticism, no matter soft or harsh/ constructive - non-constructive. Many seem
  to believe that <i>The Satanic Verses’ author Salman Rushdie or our Taslima
  are the only intellectuals who have ever been persecuted for &quot;Bashing
  Islam.&quot; No, the story does not begin with Taslima – nor does it end –
  with Rushdie. Writers, poets, intellectuals, and freethinkers have been
  suffering – and dying -- for &quot;insulting Islam&quot; for nearly 1400
  years. As, many writers have already pointed out that the lengthy list of
  &quot;Murtaad,&quot; I refrain myself of from &quot;reinventing the
  wheel&quot;.</p>
  <p>BTW, For those who have problem in accepting criticism of one's pedophilic
  character, may note how western-world criticized Abraham's character
  &quot;constructively&quot;&nbsp;just couple of decades ago -</p>
  <p>&quot;Who was Abraham? <font color="#ff0000"><u>An insane Barbarian
  patriarch</u> who married his sister, denied his wife, and seduced her
  handmaid, who drove one child into desert to starve and made preparation to
  butcher the other</font>&quot; (Ref. Illustrias Biblical Personalities; Jhon E
  Remsburg. Freethought, July 1997)</p>
  <p>How come the above statement is much more &quot;civil&quot; or
  &quot;constructive&quot; than say the criticism of&nbsp;today’s &quot;Islam
  bashers&quot; in NFB? Please don't tell me - &quot;Oh! Because the writer has
  a Christian name.&quot; If someone cannot come out from his
  &quot;parochial&quot; mindset by the given example, then, perhaps the problem
  is not in &quot;issue constructive criticism,&quot; but definitely lies
  somewhere else.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now, just before finishing,&nbsp;let me&nbsp;quote form Eddie Tabash's
  essay to illuminate their mind:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&quot;We thus need to end the pointless debate about whether to
  &quot;bash&quot; or not &quot;bash&quot; religion in the process of promoting
  secular humanism. The opponents of religious dogma should be able to attack
  and ridicule religious beliefs the same as opponents of any other belief
  system can attack and ridicule that belief system.&quot;</p>

  Debate Secular Humanists Do Not Need</font></b><font color="#008000"></p>
  </font><font color="#800000"><b>
  <p align="center">by Eddie Tabash</p>
  </b></font>
  <p>Some of us are bogging down in a debate over <b>whether the promotion of
  secular humanism should involve &quot;bashing&quot; religion, or whether we
  should only focus on presenting humanism in a positive light</b>. <b>The
  answer is that both are necessary components of the secular humanist message</b>,
  depending on the individual circumstances of each encounter, each audience,
  and each forum.</p>
  <p>When speaking to college women, for instance, it may be necessary to show
  them examples of the indefensible way that the <b>bible denigrates women</b>.
  A more watered-down presentation may not sufficiently motivate such students
  seriously to re-examine conventional assumptions about conventional religion.
  Helping today's university students become indignant over the absurdities of
  religious dogma is an essential part of persuading them to consider a secular
  alternative. If we don't start, very soon, to replenish our ranks with young
  people, out future will be dim.</p>
  <p>There is definitely a time and place to make religion look as ridiculous as
  it actually is. There is also a time and place to emphasize the opportunities
  awaiting a person who lives a life free of superstition. Overall, however, one
  cannot be done without the other. We cannot just approach college students and
  members of the general public by preaching the virtues of a life free from
  supernaturalism without giving examples of how and why religious beliefs are
  absurd and divisive.</p>
  <p>When we fear being accused of &quot;religion bashing,&quot; we are buying
  into the trap our opponents have set for us. Republicans can criticize the
  political philosophy of Democrats and vice versa. Socialists and capitalists
  can criticize each other's basic worldview.</p>
  <p>Religionists, however, have insidiously snuck into the public consciousness
  the notion that religious doctrines deserve special insulation from criticism,
  ridicule, and doubt. Religionists have poisoned the debate about religion by
  passing off this concept that, from the outset, religious claims must be
  treated with a kinder and gentler type of criticism than that leveled at other
  types of belief systems.</p>
  <b>
  <p>There is no rational basis for providing religious dogma with its own
  special exemption from harsh criticism.</b> <b>We do secular humanism an
  immense disservice if we buy into the mindset that criticism of religion has
  to be more muffled than criticism of other ideologies.</p>
  </b>
  <p>Religion is so entrenched in our society that its proponents have been able
  to foist off onto popular culture the notion that <b>religion always deserves
  kid glove treatment.</b> Because religion is so entrenched, in order to
  dislodge it, we have to use all available tactics, including destroying the
  misconception that religious beliefs are entitled to some special immunity
  from piercing criticism.</p>
  <b>
  <p>If we allow religionists to censor the words and arguments we use in our
  struggle to educate society in favor of secularism, we are essentially letting
  the fox guard the henhouse. Our society will never be receptive to a secular
  message so long as popular culture considers criticism of religion to be
  out-of-bounds.</b> Establishing the social acceptability of ridiculing the
  absurdities of religious claims is an integral part of gaining acceptance for
  secular humanism. The two cannot be artificially severed.</p>
  <b>
  <p>We cannot be intimidated into weakening our arguments whenever religionists
  accuse us of &quot;religion bashing.&quot;</b> The Catholic church is expert
  at this bully/crybaby syndrome. The church will attempt to use its claim of
  divine infallibility to cripple our personal freedoms. Then, the moment we
  fight back by challenging the church's authority to control our lives, the
  church accuses us of anti-Catholic bigotry.</p>
  <p>The forthright answer is that as long as we do not try to deprive religious
  believers of their civil liberties, as long as we do not attempt to
  criminalize their behavior - like they wish to do to us - we are not
  subjecting them to persecution. The Catholic church, along with all the other
  self-proclaimed real estate brokers of heaven, must be publicly told that
  hiding behind a claim of speaking for god will not insulate them from
  criticism.</p>
  <b>
  <p>We thus need to end the pointless debate about whether to &quot;bash&quot;
  or not &quot;bash&quot; religion in the process of promoting secular humanism.
  The opponents of religious dogma should be able to attack and ridicule
  religious beliefs the same as opponents of any other belief system can attack
  and ridicule that belief system.</b></p>
  <p>Religious doctrines that venture forth onto society's battlefield of ideas
  should not be entitled to armor that is thicker than that of any other
  combatant.</p>
