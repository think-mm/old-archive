                  Bangladesh is extremely in dire strait. Two Islamist military 
                  dictators changed the course of the nation to <i>Ummatic</i> 
                  Utopia.&nbsp; That is why, as time goes by, Bangladeshi Muslims are 
                  becoming more and more intolerant and communal.&nbsp; In an <i>
                  Ummatic</i> worldview, all crime committed by a Muslim brother

                  committed by Jamaat-i-Islami war criminals has become a taboo 
                  subject amongst Bangladeshi Muslims.&nbsp; But should the Jamaati 
                  criminals get off the hook from international public opinion 
                  so easily?&nbsp; They are the perpetrators of crime against

                  documents scattered all around the world.

                  Chile expressed his deep regrets for killing innocent people 
                  in a stadium.&nbsp; We also see examples where offspring of killers 
                  admitted their parents’ crime openly and expressed deep 
                  regrets for the victims.&nbsp; A few years ago, ABC News’ Nightline 
                  program showed a group of visitors from Germany who were on a 
                  tour in Israel.&nbsp; They were the children of Nazi officers. We 
                  know, unlike Bangladesh, Israel is a nation, which cherishes

                  Bangladesh Jamaat-i-Islami were convinced whatever killing

                  the axiom “end justifies the means.”&nbsp; In 1971, their 
                  conviction was to save Jinnah’s Pakistan, which was analogous 
                  to saving Islam. They wanted to save Pakistan by hook or by

                  Bangladesh Nationalist Party is not a secular nationalist 
                  organization.&nbsp; It has been hijacked by the nemesis of 
                  Bangladesh liberation - the notorious Jamaat-i-Islami party.&nbsp; 
                  No wonder an average BNP supporter would be very defensive of 
                  Jamaati war criminals. In this case, I want to make a parallel 
                  with the September 11 hijackers.&nbsp; The 9/11 hijackers did not 
                  have remorse knowing that their action could result in 
                  numerous losses of civilian lives.&nbsp; Similarly, the defenders 
                  of Jamaati war criminals would not care if someone describes 
                  them the gravity of the crime committed by their favorite 
                  godfathers. Their immediate attitude would be to push the 
                  issue under the rug.&nbsp; They do not want to be hung-up over 
                  1971, do not want to go with inane discussion about 1971 or do 
                  not like to create hatred between them over 1971.&nbsp; Now, the 
                  question arises about the hatred between whom?&nbsp; If a serial 
                  killer kills 12 people, even after 20 years the perpetrator 
                  gets the punishment.&nbsp; Isn’t it so?&nbsp; Today the Roman Catholic 
                  Church in USA is facing a serious financial melt down.&nbsp; This 
                  is due to the paying for litigation of a number of Catholic 
                  priests’ pedophilic behavior.&nbsp; Many of those crimes were 
                  committed more than thirty years ago.&nbsp; In Bangladesh’s case, 
                  the Jamaati apologists become very nervous when somebody wants 
                  to expose the dirty laundry of their religious heroes.</span></tt><span style="font-size: 10.0pt"><br>

                  Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-i-Islami are now more 
                  than a conjoined twin. I did not have any idea that BNP is 
                  like the sugarcoated cover of a capsule and the 
                  Jamaat-i-Islami is the main bitter ingredients until I

                  unique situation. I doubt if a typical Awami Leaguer would be 
                  any degree defensive for Rashed Khan Menon’s Worker’s Party or 
                  Dr. Kamal Hossain’s Gono Forum.&nbsp; Anyway, going back to the 
                  young gentleman who claims to be non-fundamentalist and a 
                  follower of Bangladesh Nationalist Party. &nbsp;Two years ago, I 
                  used to post messages in different forums, some of which were 
                  critical of Jamaati war criminals. &nbsp;Once I put a short comment

                  This young man, a PhD student at a prestigious Ivy League 
                  college in USA jumped from nowhere and attacked me viciously, 
                  of course on the Net.&nbsp; First I was surprised to see the person 
                  lives in USA and apparently did not look like a typical molla 
                  (his image was very much visible on his website).&nbsp; I did not 
                  understand why he had to be so much defensive about a mass 
                  murderer!&nbsp; I did not realize the person is a die-hard 
                  supporter of BNP/Jamaat-i-Islami.&nbsp; I was far from being aware 
                  that Bangladesh has become enough Talibanized nowadays.&nbsp; I 
                  then became more and more interested in knowing more about 
                  this apparently modern young man from Bangladesh.&nbsp; He is a web 
                  maker and I visited the site he used to advertise in all his 
                  postings. When I first visited the site, I was startled. It 
                  was a unique creation.&nbsp; There was sound animation, cartoon and 
                  the whole nine-yards.&nbsp; Nonetheless, there was an interesting 
                  slant in content management.&nbsp; The characters he chose to 
                  caricature are not known to be Islamic fundamentalists, nor 
                  any of them had any reputation of being war criminals.&nbsp; Rather 
                  quite a few of the subjects gained fame to uphold the causes

                  allows the players to “kill” Indian Border Security Force
