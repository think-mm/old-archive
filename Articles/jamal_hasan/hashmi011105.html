		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have been following a

		http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~dludden/agrhist_bdesh.htm</font></a><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Dr.

		Hashmi was in my opposite camp. I recall in one posting&nbsp;he presented the 
		probability that I could be someone who was changing political color 
		with each regime change. Before that in another debate, which is called 
		the Jinnah Debate&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: Helv"><a><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#000099" size="2">http://cyber_bangla0.tripod.com/Debate/Jinnah_Debate.html</font></strong></a></span><font face="Verdana">,&nbsp;he 
		termed Larry Collins' and Dominique Lapierre's book &quot;Freedom at 
		Midnight&quot; as merely a toilet paper. Later on, in a rejoinder he 
		aplogized for his unscholarly remark.&nbsp; Much water has traversed in Padma 
		and Potomac since then. Lately Dr. Hashmi became a fellow activist in 
		our fight against political Islam by becoming a fellow activist of 
		fatemolla. We&nbsp;saw his new role of being a&nbsp;part of a new world-wide 
		anti-Political Islam movement, namely NO TO POLITICAL ISLAM<strong>
		<font color="#330099">[http://www.ntpi.org/].</font></strong></font></font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I thought Dr. Hashmi of 1997 and 
		Dr. Hashmi of 2005 are not the same. I thought because of his presumed 
		&quot;distaste&quot; for mullaism, he would hardly be a fan of Khaleda-Nizami axis 
		of evil. I thought&nbsp;the old&nbsp;Dr. Taj Hashmi has&nbsp;metamorphosed for the 
		better.&nbsp;Apparently that is far from the reality. Unfortunately, in the 
		recent days he simply disappointed me totally. </font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It started with two articles 
		posted in Asiapeace, which the Canadian resident pedagogue terms as a 
		group of liberal South Asians. The moderator of another e-forum 
		forwarded me the texts of the Asiapeace&nbsp;opinions, one from Dr. Hashmi 
		and the other from a Pakistani living in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi 
		resident Pakistani's writing could be anything but a liberal viewpoint. 
		He made a distorted version of the genesis of Bangladesh and made all 
		the efforts to justify Pakistani army brutality. Dr. Hashmi on the other 
		hand wrote a very much non-scholarly highly jargonized piece, which was 
		primarily a typical Awami League bashing essay.</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Hashmi has repeatedly made 
		it clear that he is a historian. But his Asiapeace commentary could only 
		unravel the superficial, extremely opinionated irrational side of his 
		psyche. If the essay was written by a Jamaati activist that is one 
		thing. It is hard to fathom the writer of &quot;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Musa 
		Sadik's Essay on the Mujib Killing: My Rebuttal&quot; in Asiapeace is also 
		the </span>author of &quot;<em>Peasant Utopia: The Communalization of Class 
		Politics in East Bengal, 1920-1947</em>.&quot; Dr. Bilayet Hossain dissected 
		Hashmi's Asiapeace write-up. So, I am not going further on the subject.</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is simply impossible for a 
		single individual to be an expert of all regional issues. I do not 
		expect Dr. Hashmi to be well conversant of contemporary Algerian or 
		Iranian history. But as a historian he ought to be more tactful about 
		what he is going to express in public forums. In a recent posting titled 
		&quot;History, Myth, Concoction and Ignorance: In Response to Jaffor Ullah 
		and Monsur Ibrahim&quot; [News from Bangladesh, October 27, 2005]&nbsp;he gave the 
		big bombshell. His sweeping comments about Algeria and Iran totally 
		disappointed me. After reading the whole text, I wanted to&nbsp;believe 
		someone using the good name of Dr. Taj Hashmi wrote the below average 
		piece. </font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I thought as an avid proponent 
		of NO TO POLITICAL ISLAM, Dr. Hashmi might have been a good analyst of 
		Islamization issue of Bangladesh. I thought he could, with his scholarly 
		background, could differentiate between the fundamental politial 
		structures of the&nbsp;ruling parties of Indonesia and Bangladesh. Even a 
		non-historian like&nbsp;myself can safely say, as far as ruling eliticism is 
		concerned, the Indonesian mullas linked to Jemaah Islamiya h</font><font face="Times New Roman"><a><font face="Verdana" color="#000099" size="2">ttp://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/ji.htm</font></a></font><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;are 
		nowhere close to the mullas linked to Jamat-i-Islami or Islami Oikkyo 
		Jote of Bangladesh. That is the reason, Bangladesh has more potential to 
		be rapidly Talibanized than any other South East Asian country.</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the NFB opinion of the 27th 
		October, Dr. Hashmi brought the Algerian civil war&nbsp;and stunned me more. 
		He put an illogical query, &quot;Does anyone portray Algeria as the next 
		Taliban state?&quot; No, sir, at this moment&nbsp;Algeria having a powerful 
		secular military establishment who are&nbsp;fighting the Islamists tooth and 
		nail, the chance of Talibanization of that African country is not 
		a&nbsp;possibility. Of course, if the secular army dominated Algerian regime 
		listened to their people's choice and allowed the Islamic Salvation 
		Front (<em>Front Islamique du Salut</em>) to rule the country, Algeria 
		might have been a Sharia-based country today. I hope Dr. Hashmi could 
		refresh his Algerian history for the sake of his dignity.</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Turkish and Algerian military 
		are nothing but card-carrying strong arm secular entities. On the other 
		hand the Bangladeshi and Pakistani armies can be called anything but 
		secular. Moreover, both of those South Asian militaries are infiltrated 
		by Islamists to different levels. Having said that, I can draw a common 
		denominator between the mlitary establishments of Turkey, Algeria and 
		Pakistan. All of the three power brokers have&nbsp; the benefit of providing 
		the last word in their respective country's governance.</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, I am going back to Dr. 
		Hashmi's 27th October's commentary again. He started the eighth 
		paragraph this way, <em><b>&quot;I am NOT at all surprised at Dr Ullah’s 
		citing Bertil Lintner’s over-sensationalizing piece in the FEER and Wall 
		Street Journal in April 2002 on the “impending Islamic revolution” in 
		Bangladesh. I have written enough on the subject.....&quot;</b>. &nbsp;</em>After 
		reading that I&nbsp;almost fell off from my chair. Is Dr. Hashmi out of his 
		mind? Isn't he aware of the well-coordinated&nbsp;simultaneous&nbsp;four hundred 
		fifty bomb explosions across the country? Was that world record making 
		incident less sensational than any of Bertil Lintner's dispatches? A few 
		days ago, former U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Howard Schaffer gave an 
		interview for the Voice of America - Bangla service. In the two parts 
		interview, Ambassador Schaffer depicted a possible scenario of 
		Bangladeshi jihadists' taking over the country's seat of power. 
		Ambassador Schaffer said, that is his worst nightmare, which he did not 
		wish to happen.</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I was going through Dr. 
		Hashmi's NFB piece, I had more surprises to follow. His another 
		paragraph started with such prophecy, <em>&quot;While Iran is gradually 
		de-Islamizing itself and one assumes in the next ten years it will be a 
		secular, liberal democracy, why should we buy Lintner-Griswold theses 
		that Bangladesh is on the threshold of an Islamic revolution? Do you 
		know, what the term “revolution” imply Dr Ullah?.....&quot;</em></font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have been following Iranian 
		politics for sometime. Other than studying accessible reading materials 
		on Iranian affairs, I kept a regular linkage with sources in Iran 
		through different channels. My motivation was&nbsp;to get a sense of Iranian 
		people's mindset. When President Khatami was in power, I belonged to the 
		optimistic bunch of analysts, whose pipe dream was to see Iran as a 
		modern secular country. A few years ago a&nbsp;reporter from the leading 
		American daily, namely <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em> interviewed 
		me on Iranian affairs. The newsstory titled &quot;IRAN: Internal split thwart 
		U.S. thaw&quot; published on January 12, 2002 carried my name as a Iran 
		watcher. As the reformist President Khatami was failing to deliver, my 
		optimism about Iran's future was gradually dwindling. So, Mahmoud 
		Ahmadinejad's ascension to power and the country's gradual shift back to 
		conservatism did not surprise me at all. That is why President 
		Ahmadinejad's recent comment&nbsp;&quot;Israel was a 'disgraceful blot', 
		that&nbsp;should be 'wiped off the map'&quot; did not raise my eyebrow a bit. &nbsp;No, 
		Dr. Hashmi, you are totally wrong. Contrary to your unsubstantiated 
		prediction, Iran seems to be reinventing itself in energized Islamic 
		utopia with full force. Most of the past gains in reformism and 
		liberalism are thrown to the bunker.</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. Taj Hashmi said near the 
		end, <em>&quot;Since I do not accept either Jinnah or Mujib as the fathers of 
		the nations of Pakistan and Bangladesh, it does not mean that I 
		disrespect them.....&quot; </em>I have to challenge his honesty at this 
		juncture. A little more than a&nbsp;month ago in Asiapeace the History 
		scholar&nbsp;from Canada wrote, <b>&quot;One day Satan was missing. Finally he was 
		found out at Road 32 (Mujib's residence), clinging the feet of Mujib. On 
		asking the Satan responded: &quot;I want to know the secret of Mujib's majic. 
		I bluffed only two human beings (Adam and Eve) and God expelled me from 
		the Paradise. This man is deceiving 75 million people (Bangladesh 
		population in 1973) and God is totally indifferent about it&quot;</b>. If 
		that is a discourse of respectfulness, then we ought to change 
		the&nbsp;definition of respect according to Dr. Hashmi's formula.&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="RTE">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I think Dr. Taj Hashmi, the lost 
		soul in the world of history is becoming a total stranger to me.</font></p>
