                          that I chose for my article’s is not depicting a
                          sequence from a Hollywood movie by any long shot. In
                          this short article I will discuss a serious matter. It
                          is a matter of life and death. It is a heartbreaking
                          real-life drama where you see a man is in manacles.
                          Believe me, the manacles came as a result of <i>Wahhabiized</i>
                          Sharia’s perilous shadow in Pakistan.</font>
                          <p><font color="#008080">The subject of this
                          profoundly sad image is none other than Dr. Younus
                          Sheikh, a medical doctor and teacher, who were
                          sentenced to death by none other than Pakistan’s
                          draconian Blasphemy Law.</font></p>
                          <p><font color="#000080">Dr. Sheikh was charged with
                          blasphemy for answers he gave to students about
                          whether the Prophet Muhammad followed Muslim practices
                          before he assumed prophethood. The 1986 Blasphemy Law
                          C-295 of the Pakistani Penal Code (PCC) in practice
                          gives license to any fanatic or cynic to accuse
                          arbitrarily anyone for insulting or defaming the
                          Prophet of Islam.</font></p>

                  </table>
                  <p><font color="#000080">It reads as follows: Use of
                  derogatory remarks etc. in respect of the Holy Prophet:
                  Whether by words, either spoken or written, or by visible
                  representations, or by any imputation, innuendo or
                  insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name
                  of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) shall be punishable
                  with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall be liable to
                  fine. The Amnesty International views this barbaric law this
                  way: &quot;The Blasphemy Laws of Pakistan are a handy tool to
                  silence debate and dissent. They are also used to detain
                  people when the real motivation includes land issues or
                  professional rivalry. In the interest of justice, the
                  blasphemy laws should be abolished or as a first step amended
                  to prevent abuse&quot;.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">Blasphemy Law is integral part of <i>Wahhabite</i>
                  brand of Islam, which propagates its divinely driven <i>Sharia
                  Law</i>. In the Indian subcontinent during the hundreds of
                  years of Mughal Raj, Islam had been the dominant religion. <i>Wahhabite</i>
                  Sunnism with its enormous power of petrodollars was not even
                  existent those days.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#008080">That is why chopping hands for minor
                  thievery or capital punishment for &quot;insulting the
                  Prophet&quot; was not heard of for hundreds of years.
                  Moreover, the Indian subcontinent gave birth to a kinder and
                  gentler form of Islam, which was in true sense, &quot;a
                  religion of peace.&quot; Therefore, it comes as no surprise
                  that Sufism flourished in many parts of India during those
                  golden days of benevolent Islam.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">Let us not forget for a moment that
                  South Asia was also a place of saints like Nizamuddin Aulia in
                  Delhi or Hazrat Moinuddin Chisti in Ajmer or Hazrat Shah Jalal
                  in Sylhet. Till today, devotees from all facets of life, from
                  all religious groups gather in those shrines for spiritual
                  salvation. This is an amazing scenario of composite culture
                  where Hindus and Muslims come to a common place of Divinity.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">The present-day high tide of
                  Wahhabite brand of Islam is a juxtaposition of peaceful Sufi
                  Islam, which used to be prevalent in the Indian subcontinent.
                  This fascistic philosophy that espouses a draconian archaic
                  idea is gathering strength not only in Muslim majority
                  countries, but also in western societies where Muslims are
                  gaining a stronghold. This is a far cry from the teachings of
                  Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi, the greatest Sufi Islam had ever
                  produced.</font></p>

                            cycle of <i>Sharia</i> with its abdication of
                            women’s rights and imposition of an antiquated
                            judiciary poses a serious challenge in liberal
                            countries with a Muslim majority. Like the domino,
                            Afghanistan and Iran are following some forms of
                            Sharia-based political ideology. This surmises a
                            totalitarian worldview where individual rights are
                            squashed at the mercy of some religious elites. The
                            oligarch attains absolute power where accountability
                            is a rare subject. As the extreme example of
                            Mosque-State conjugation, these Sharia-based
                            societies showed the ultimate ugliness any
                            philosophy could produce.</font></td>

                  </div>
                  <p><font color="#008080">The vanguards of Sharia would like to
                  portray the religion they practice as &quot;peaceful and
                  humane&quot; and they would always claim that there &quot;are
                  no excesses in the religion.&quot; They also constantly
                  paraphrase another rhetoric for public consumption regarding
                  the most &quot;tolerant form of religion.&quot; In reality,
                  though, their hypocritical ploy may dwarf the big brother in
                  George Orwell’s famous novelette, &quot;Nineteen eighty
                  four.&quot; Whatever the champions of Wahhabite ideology
                  pronounce, the opposite may be true in reality. Dr. Younus
                  Sheikh’s fate is an ideal example justifying this argument.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">Muslims in America, especially
                  Bangladeshi Muslims are becoming the innocent preys of the <i>Wahhabite
                  </i>Islamists’ global agenda. Many of them are unknowingly
                  becoming part of a mosque-based political network. Also, a
                  substantial number of them join various Islamist groups
                  without knowing that they are ultimately strengthening a force
                  that may someday push them (Bangladeshis) to a collision
                  course against their host country.</font></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">Many of them love music but they have
                  no clue that in Sharia-based societies listening to many such
                  music may be tantamount to committing a big crime.
                  Unfortunately, blind adherence to faith often transforms a
                  rational human being into a living robot.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">While Islamists want to portray that
                  the basis of religion has strong footing on historical
                  rationale, no historical scrutiny of the religion is
                  permissible by them. There is no outcry if Jesus Christ is
                  discussed among secular historians in a historical
                  perspective. Nobody gets a capital punishment by uttering such
                  word, &quot;Jesus Christ was born a Jew.&quot; That is why ABC
                  TV’s &quot;In Search of Jesus Christ&quot; boldly gave the
                  non-devotee’s perspective.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">The reality is such that Christianity
                  is showing its tolerance and mercifulness. Moreover, it seems
                  that there are no compulsion or excesses in Christianity. In
                  the Christian domain, no moral police or members of virtue or
                  vice censored any documentary to be palatable to the devotees.
                  This is why viewers did not have to watch a sanitized and
                  patronizing version of the ABC documentary.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">Bangladesh is next in line to embrace
                  the intolerant brand of <i>Wahhabite</i> Islam if it has not
                  already done so. The followers of such archaic dogma
                  overshadow one of the leading parties in Bangladesh. If they
                  are fortunate to win the election, more and more Younus
                  Sheikhs with manacles tied in hand may be seen in front of
                  Bait-ul Mukkaram or any other famous Mosque. Because of the
                  historical blunders of secular forces, that could be a real
                  possibility.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="#000080">Voters in Bangladesh should think
                  twice before they cast their valuable vote in the next
                  election because too much is at stake including future
                  direction of Bangladesh’s civil society. They shouldn’t be
                  smitten twice.</font><font color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></p>
