		<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Verdana">I recently 
		read a review of by A.C Grayling on Bernhard-Herni Levy’s <i>War, Evil 
		and the End of History</i> in the <i>Financial Times</i> (UK). The piece 
		comments on how a young Levy, the renowned French intellectual and 
		social activist, had once nurtured a desire to fight for the liberation 
		and independence of the Bengali people during the war of ’71. He had 
		heard the calls for an ‘international brigade’ for East Pakistan, now 
		Bangladesh, while he was a student in Paris. The idealistic and 
		multi-national brigade would be modelled on the foreign fighters that 
		flooded into Spain to help Republicans fight the fascist dictatorship of 
		General Franco. Like the heroic force of the 1930’s which has been 
		immortalised in books such as Earnest Hemingway’s <i>For Thom the Bell 
		Tolls</i>, this volunteer guerrilla force would be made up of western 
		students and idealist fighters who would come to the aid of the Mukti 
		Bahini (liberation fighters) and help them fight the Pakistani Army and 
		the Islamist forces of the Jamaat-i-Islami. Levy, at 22, went to work as 
		a war reporter in the region covering the conflict and the subsequent 
		intervention of the Indian military which helped bring a quick victory. 
		Bangladesh had a bloody birth. This revelation automatically struck a 
		chord deep within me. I realised that I to have been bitten by the bug, 
		I realised that I have also answered this ‘call to arms’ to help the 
		Bangladeshi struggle. The current situation in Bangladesh and the rise 
		of radical Islamism is almost a mirror image of the fight which took 
		place 34 years ago. The wounds of the nation have not been allowed to 
		heal. Those that were defeated are intent on reclaiming this prize and 
		destroying the progress that has been made. </span></p>

		<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Verdana">There is 
		something about the Bengali culture, spirit and history which has 
		unleashed a passion from within me. I don’t believe it is because of any 
		socialist undertones, the impression of a pending Trotsky style 
		revolution or through the idolisation of Che Guevara and is his 
		guerrilla war against imperialism which once drove young socialists in 
		the 70’s. This love affair and passion is unlikely to diminish and I 
		believe this attraction to Bangladesh will only grow and consolidate 
		with time.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white" align="justify">
		<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Verdana">As I daily 
		read articles, magazine and books on all things to do with Bangladesh, 
		my appetite for knowledge of everything Bengali is perhaps becoming 
		unsurpassed, but it brings me great sadness. I feel that I share the 
		same type of experience as many of my Bangladeshi contemporaries who are 
		now once again fighting for their countries identity and stability. 
		Maybe this bond is because I have also shared the same feelings of being 
		isolated and being left out in the wilderness; with nobody wanting to 
		listen to my warnings. For years I had cried about the evils of radical 
		Islamism in the UK; but nobody would dare to tackle it head on. Nobody 
		would listen. I often stressed that with the right amount of exposure 
		and debate it would help to stop the build up of tension and possibly 
		avert disaster. I now put this inaction simply down to lack of will to 
		learn; history has shown that it is often only until the worst case 
		scenario happens that society is forced to react. I also believe that it 
		is because no one wants to be seen to be throwing the first blow. It is 
		often difficult to mobilise a nation to a threat that hasn’t fully 
		materialised.</span></p>

		Unfortunately it took the suicide-bomb attacks in London on 7th July 
		2005 to change this malaise. The media have become more educated to the 
		threat and have been more selective and assertive as a result. I have 
		often said the UK has been the weakest link in the ‘War on Terror’, this 
		has been backed up by anti-terrorism specialists from around the globe 
		who have said the nation’s capital should be called ‘Londonistan’ for 
		all the radical Islamists the government willingly hosted. I knew before 
		the bombings that it would only take the senseless slaughter of innocent 
		blood on British soil for there to be any change in our approach to 
		fighting the much needed ideological war. Bombs and bullets only help to 
		combat radical jihadi fighters on a battlefield, but they can’t destroy 
		the ideology. We needed to start grappling with Islamism and its 
		policies through debate and argument if we are to defeat it. Before the 
		bombings I would watch and listen as journalists, politicians and 
		commentators would often skirt around the issues of radical Islamism and 
		miss their points in the process. It was only after the bombings that 
		people began to realise the horror of our inaction; of the previous 
		inability to talk openly about the threats we faced from radical 
		Islamism and the gentle softly-softly treatment of its apologists in the 
		newspapers and on television.</span></p>

		<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Verdana">I know it 
		sounds arrogant and self-righteous, but in the past whenever I had made 
		a prediction which ran contrary to the majority of everyone else’s 
		beliefs and got it right- I would get an immense feeling of 
		self-satisfaction and pride. I would almost explode with adulation when 
		proved correct; there would be no greater pleasure than saying “I told 
		you so.” Arrogant as I once was and probably &nbsp;still am; now when I have 
		success in predicting horror and despair I feel deeply let down- that I 
		personally haven’t done enough to stop it. I don’t get any satisfaction 
		from being right, I only feel regret.</span></p>

		<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white" align="justify">
		<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black; font-family: Verdana">I do 
		believe that the current crisis which is threatening Bangladesh could 
		have been averted; but alas time can’t be turned back, this unfortunate 
		reality will become a part of Bangladesh’s history. However in the long 
		run no matter how bad and dark the situation becomes, the Bengali people 
		will once again prevail and not just over the war on radical Islamism 
		but in general- economic and socially. The ‘spirit of liberation’ still 
		burns in the hearts of journalists, artists, musicians, politicians. 
		This spirit gives people the will to face amazing adversary. It now also 
		burns within me. I have an unflinching belief that things will be 
		alright in the end, no matter what hurdles are placed in the countries 
		way. I also know that if things become so bad the Bengali people need 
		not worry for long, because I know that as long as the Bangladeshi 
		people are united in their culture and spirit that with the proper 
		education of friends a new legion of Bernhard-Henri Levy’s will once 
		again come to your aid. </span></p>
