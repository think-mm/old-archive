					<b><span lang="EN-US">The name Stephen Demetri Georgiou 
					sounds Greek to me. Presumably, his Greek Cypriot father 
					wanted to keep his side of the family heritage intact. But 
					the child had to break the rule sometime. The name Cat 
					Stevens sounded more mainstream for a rock star. Thus, the 
					change. Cat Stevens’ picture on the above left became a 
					household image during his rock n’ roll days. In a 
					democratic permissive society, anybody who is changing his 
					or her religion does not typically raise any eyebrow. But 
					when Cat Stevens metamorphosed to be Yusuf Islam, and 
					growing beard (picture on the above right) to the length as 
					prescribed in Sahih Hadith, many pop scene watchers realized 
					that that was the end of his rock n’ roll career. Cat’s 
					conversion to Islam is not very unusual. Today, we see many 
					Westerners convert to Islam when there lives are locked into 
					sinkhole. The notorious shoe-bomber British born Richard 
					Reid to American dirty bomber Jose Padilla have one thing in 
					common. Circumstances had failed to give them a life on a 
					straight path. Their propensity to petty thievery, thuggery, 
					etc., led them to land on a regimented primitive dogmatic 
					religion. Cat Stevens had a similar situation. Sex, drugs, 
					and rock n’ roll took him to the bottom of the dungeon. 
					After searching for peace in &quot;all the wrong places,&quot; he 
					found Islam. According to the former rock star, he found 
					&quot;road to salvation&quot; after reading the Koran. Cat said of the 
					Koran, &quot;I had all the jig-saw puzzle pieces but the light 
					was switched off. The Koran turned on the light.&quot; Aha! Isn’t 
					it quite amazing?</span></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0cm" align="justify">
					<b><span lang="EN-US">Cat Stevens’ metamorphosis to an 
					Arabicized, medieval dogma that was later pursued by the 
					likes of Johny Lindh, Richard Reid, Jose Padilla, or David 
					Hicks. The quintessential Maulana Yusuf Islam with truly 
					Islamic beard fell into the trap of pure political Islam, 
					which is commonly called the Wahhabist Islam. From the day 
					one of his Muslim identity, he was well aware that he was 
					destined to serve Allah and his Muslim brethren. If Cat 
					chose to be a follower of Sufi Islam, he probably could have 
					continued to be a singer. But, in Wahhabism? No such thing 
					is permitted. Not only that, poetry, art, any creative 
					artistic human endeavor is simply a no-no in the book of 
					Cat’s “peaceful” Islam. Most of other religions have not 
					abandoned the finer side of human quality. Christian, 
					Buddhist, or even a Hindu priest can enjoy a Bach, 
					Tchaikovsky, or Schubert in a packed hall. For a Muslim 
					cleric endeavoring such venture, is a sure road to hell. 
					Therefore, the “cool cat” Cat Stevens aka Yusuf Islam 
					slipped away from the &quot;decadent&quot; Western musical scene very 
					rapidly. His abandonment of music career did not finish the 
					up beating of his vocal cord. He was the leading voice from 
					the Western stock who recited the lilting tune of Koran and 
					sang political songs for Muslim suffering brethren. Don’t we 
					already know that a true Islamist such as Cat has to be a 
					good mis-representative and double-talker to enhance his 
					agenda! In a recent interview with a reporter of ABC News’ 
					20/20, Yusuf proved that once again. While asked why he 
					abandoned his music career, his reply was, &quot;The drug 
					addiction and all the corruption that comes with the pop 
					scene was not good for me.&quot; Maulana Yusuf Islam deliberately 
					avoided being truthful. That is, in the Wahhabist worldview, 
					there is no room for &quot;Peace Train.&quot; </span></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0cm" align="justify">
					<b><span lang="EN-US">Whenever any Westerner converts to 
					Islam, it gives a big boost to Islamists all around the 
					world. I had the chance to see Yusuf Islam flyers in local 
					mosques where devotees were proudly talking about the great 
					pioneer of Islam. Yusuf had a very busy Islamic life in 
					England. He was involved in quite a few charities and 
					humanitarian (oh! Islamic activities) in order to help 
					causes of earthlings (Muslims) of Bosnia, Kosovo, and 
					Kashmir. His truncated sense of humanity gave a damn about 
					the sufferings of non-Muslim people of our planet. After 
					all, to a Muslim devotee, life of a non-Muslim carries no 
					value whatsoever. </span></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0cm" align="justify">
					<b><span lang="EN-US">Then came the dastardly attack of nine 
					eleven. Like many Muslims of the world, Cat Stevens had to 
					go for some soul searching. His devotion to help Muslim 
					people’s cause faced a sudden pause. Apparently, the singer 
					turned Islamic zealot had to tone down his rhetoric. Salman 
					Rushdie noted that and commented in a post 9/11 essay that 
					Cat Stevens became a &quot;pussy cat.&quot; It may not be coincidental 
					that after the tragedy of September 11, 2001, Cat’s beard 
					trimmed up a bit and he committed the mortal sin of 
					re-recording of his un-Islamic golden oldies probably like 
					rest of us he needed the dough. </span></b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0cm" align="justify">
					<b><span lang="EN-US">Like any hard-core Wahhabist 
					ideologue, his ties to global Jihadists are not an 
					impossibility. After all, it was Yusuf Islam who carpingly 
					had said on the record that according to teaching of Islam, 
					an apostate like Salman Rushdie did not have the right to 
					live. Most recently in ABC News’ 20/20 program, Maulana 
					Yusuf Islam refused to denounce suicide bombings in Israel. 
					It may be mention worthy here that he made it abundantly 
					clear on many occasions that the suicide bombers have 
					&quot;hijacked&quot; Islam. Is it really so, Mr. Cat, I mean Mr. 
					Islam? Didn’t the 9/11 hijackers reflect the ultimate agenda 
					of Wahhabism, which sadly became the true spirit of your 
					life! </span></b></p>

					<b><span lang="EN-US">Then the bomb shell came last month. 
					The goodie two shoes Cat was deported from USA back to UK. 
					Of course, it was America’s Homeland Security’s lack of 
					alertness, or undesired mix up. Yusuf Islam being on USA’s 
					watch list even allowed to board a United Airlines Flight en 
					route to Dulles International Airport. Where on earth a 
					person on Uncle Sam‘s &quot;no-fly&quot; list could be allowed to 
					board a U.S. bound plane? The rationale was a typical 
					bureaucratic bungling. The list, as was explained later by 
					the concerned authority contained the name &quot;Usuf&quot; instead of 
					&quot;Yusuf&quot;. Anyway, Cat must have known that after September 11 
					of 2001, the USA has turned into a brand new world. There is 
					now almost zero tolerance for appeasers of global Jihadists. 
					As the time goes by, noose is tightening. Alamoudi and Yusuf 
					Islam might have been welcome figures at the White House a 
					while ago. Now, no more. Poor Cat should have to think twice
