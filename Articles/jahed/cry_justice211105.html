		<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bibhuti Bhushan Chowdhury (60+) started his 
		day in a usual fashion. At 10-30 morning on November 8th, 2005, he was 
		going through the pages of a Bangla daily newspaper in the local Bazaar 
		of Delduar Thana in Tangail district. Suddenly someone from the behind 
		attacked him with a chopper. The assailant started hitting Bibhuti at 
		random with the chopper. Fortunately, there were people around him who 
		rushed to the scene, captured the attacker and saved Bibhuti before it 
		was too late. Some of these rescuers were also wounded. Bibhuti now had 
		a chance to look at his assailant. Amid awe and shock, he discovered- 
		the culprit was Motu Mia, a man who had never been a stranger to Bibhiti 
		Bhushan's home; indeed, one who often helped Bibhuti's family with 
		household tasks in return for money, food and clothes. The incident was 
		reported next day (November 9, 2005) in most national Bangla dailies: 
		Ittefaq, Janakantha, Jugantar, Inquilab, etc). What, however, is not yet 
		reported in any newspaper is the following:</font></div>
	<div>
		<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div>
		<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Police station is only a 10 minutes 
		walk from the place of the incident, police came to the scene three and 
		half hours later. What is even worse, they denied to accept the case 
		initially, and it was after eight hours from the time when the incident 
		occurred that police finally accepted the case. Not so unusual in 
		Bangladesh! I, too,understand. But there is more to it. Police captured 
		Motu Mia but but set him free at the same night of November 8th. Some 
		people have the opinion that Motu Mia is a mentally abnormal 
		living-from-hand-to-mouth person, and didn't have any ill motives behind 
		the attack. <b>This logic falls astray when we consider: why did local 
		police deny to accept the case? Why did they release Motu Mia 
		immediately after they captured him? If Motu Mia were really a mentally 
		ill person, how come he didn't attack any one previously? Is it then 
		possible- some influential group hired Motu or paid him to kill Bibhuti 
		Bhushan Chowdhury and police was aware of it?</b></font></div>
	<div>
		<b><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	</b>
	<div>
		<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't yet know any answers to the above 
		questions. Nor does even Biswajit Chowdhury- Bibhuti Bhushan Chowdhury's 
		eldest son living in the New York city- know any. I know Biswajit 
		Chowdhury for quite some time. A former graduate of Dhaka <i>Charukola</i> 
		(fine arts) Institute and now a student of Master's in Fine Arts, 
		Biswajit is thoroughly a patriotic, non-communal and peace loving person 
		from Bangladesh. He lives here with his brother, wife, one son and one 
		daughter. For long, I didn't see him as tense, worried, as I saw after 
		this &quot;unbelievable&quot; (in his words) incident happened to his father who 
		has always been respected as a gentleman by Hindus and Muslims alike in 
		his area. &quot;Does your father have any prior history of animosity with 
		Motu Mia, or any one else in your area?&quot; I asked Biswajit. &quot;No and 
		never, as far as I know,&quot; he replied. &quot;The main reason I'm concerned 
		about is <b>A few local people are trying hard to turn the whole 
		incident to 180 degree angle and make it a communal issue.&quot; &quot;There are 
		reasons to fear since we have a few hundred Hindu families living over 
		there,&quot; </b>said Biswajit with a gloomy face. I could saw him calling 
		his home back in Bangladesh and finding out latest about the situation. 
		&quot;What about administration's role?&quot; I asked Biswajit. &quot;The 
		administration at district and higher level has been responsive but what 
		I need most is the local Thana to act.&quot; &quot;All I want is to know- if there 
		was someone else behind the attack and if so, police must take action- 
		disclose the real culprit's identity before the public,&quot; Biswajit 
		stated. </font></div>
	<div>
		<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div>
		<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've something to say to the present 
		government and its administrations although Biswajit has requested me 
		not to add any politics or religion to this news. Present government and 
		its administrations always emphasize- we must project our country's 
		image in a positive way before the international community. There is 
		nothing wrong in this belief so long as one acts according to his/her 
		beliefs. </font><b><font face="Verdana">As he's been in the past, even 
		now after all this happened, Biswajit Chowdhury is very careful not to 
		do anything which would tarnish the image of the people back home. Is it 
		too much to&nbsp;expect that&nbsp;the present administration&nbsp; would ensure- 
		Biswajit Chowdhury is not deprived of the justice and the real 
		culprit&nbsp;and the motives of the attack&nbsp;would be unmasked&nbsp;?</font></div>
