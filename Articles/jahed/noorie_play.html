	revision, written and dedicated by us to the memory of a young Bangladeshi 
	Bar Dancer who died after suffering inhuman treatment in an Indian prison. 
	What we present now is an English draft. A revised version as well as 
	translations in Bengali, Hindi and Tamil would follow. We are working with 
	theatre groups in Texas, in India and in the Netherlands to perform this 
	play to make the plight of refugees in India and of bar dancers better 
	known. We request the support and help of groups interested in performing 
	this play with whatever modifications/alterations/changes they wish to make 
	to make it more acceptable to a local audience. While the rights for the 
	play rest with Mukto-Mona, we do not request anything other than an 
	acknowledgement from any groups performing this play on our behalf and on 
	behalf of Mid Day, the Mumbai newspaper that first broke the story of the 
	dancer on whose life this fiction is based.<br>
	<br>
	We do request, however, that if some group charges for tickets and makes 
	money, that they donate some of it to any reputable organization working for 
	the welfare of refugees and for bar dancers in different parts of the world.
	<br>
	<br>
	Please send your comments, views and suggestions to our forums. We hope that 
	we shall refine the play further with your support. All suggestions that are 
	accepted would be gratefully acknowledged in the final version.<br>

	<b>&nbsp;(A Play in 5 Acts) </b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
	<b>Dedication: </b>This play is based on the real life incident of a &quot;bar 
	dancer&quot; as strippers are known in India who committed suicide after being 
	separated from her children, when the family were arrested as illegal 
	immigrants from Bangladesh. The story was originally broken by the Mumbai 
	based newspaper Mid Day after some of the police and prison staff spoke to 
	the newspaper, horrified by what happened. We dedicate this play to 
	suffering people, especially refugees, everywhere, to the editors and staff 
	at Mid Day for their example in being the only Indian newspaper to carry 
	this terrible tale and to brave people like the police and prison staff who 
	took this story to the newspaper. Our thanks also go to Mr Joe Nathan, 
	Editor of Confluence, without a doubt the finest expatriate news and 
	perspectives journal of the South Asian community, for his wholehearted 
	support for this project the moment he heard about it.<br>
	<br>
	We hope to feature this play in English and Bengali languages on the Mukto-Mona 
	website and welcome it's translation and performance in various languages by 
	anyone who wishes to do this on a voluntary basis. As always, we welcome 
	reproduction of this play anywhere with acknowledgement of the writers and 
	of the Mukto-Mona organization as the holders of the copyrights. Any 
	modification/improvisation/suggestions are welcome and if anyone chooses to 
	perform this play anywhere, please let us know about the performance and 
	send us copies of any review of any performance that takes place anywhere. 
	We would also welcome translations of this play into any language and, if 
	the translated version is sent to us in a pdf format, would be glad to post 
	it with the English and Bengali translations on our website with full credit 
	to the translators.<br>
	<br>
	Thank you very much for your support and we hope that this play would bring 
	the Sheikh family and millions of suffering people living as refugees across 
	the world the recognition that they deserve. This suffering must end and we 
	hope that our next play would be a more positive one than this one.<br>

	<br>
	Noorie – The Bar Dancer. She is a young woman in her early 30s, very pretty 
	and with a smiling expression when she is with her children, but with a

	beyond his age<br>

	more than lying down with his head on his mother's lap <br>
	<br>
	Shanta – Another dancer at the bar, younger than Noorie but not as pretty.

&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
	The bathroom in an Indian prison. The scene is dank and the walls are in 
	need of maintenance with paint peeling off. Noorie is lying slumped by a tap 
	under which a bucket stands, her wrists are bleeding and two other 
	prisoners, women, come in, look at her and start screaming. Some prison 
	warders and a policewoman enter and try to revive Noorie, and then pick her 
	up and carry her out. As the room empties, the light dims and a voice comes 
	from the background.<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: So they are carrying me away. (Laughs) I am being treated better in 
	death than I ever was in life. (Laughs even more) You may wonder why I am 
	laughing when I know that my babies will never see me again. Well, I looked 
	at myself as they carried me away. It was something that I did not do for 
	six years. (Pauses) I never looked at myself except when I dressed before I 
	went on the floor. (slows down even more) I tried not to look at myself even 
	then, but how could anyone dress without a mirror? I had to look ...(She is 
	about to say &quot;attractive&quot; or something similar, but lets the word trail 
	off.) (After a pause, she continues) The men looked at me. They stared at me 
	in the bar and on the street. Some smiled while others undressed me with 
	their eyes even when I was with my family. The women in the basti would turn 
	away and slap their boys if they looked in my direction. They would fight 
	with their men if they caught them looking at me. (Laughs again)<br>
	<br>
	The men would be there at night, especially on Saturdays when they received 
	their wages. And the boys wanted to be there when they were old enough. 
	Their families might not have had food to eat, but they had to be there. 
	They had to watch me, look at me, throw their money my way. Did I feel bad 
	for their families? I did. I still do. But I had a husband and children to 
	feed. I had a life to live. (Her voice breaks and recovers)<br>
	<br>
	It's funny, isn't it? I am being carried away from a bathroom with my 
	clothes on. (Laughs) This, after six years in the presence of men with them 
	mostly off. (Pauses) I could not bear to have a mirror in the bathroom at 
	home. (Her voice breaks almost to a whisper) This is the first time that I 
	am looking at myself after I started working. Tell me, do I look beautiful? 
	I was named Noorie after all, short for &quot;Noor-e-Chashmi.&quot; Or, did everyone 
	stare at me for some reason other than how I looked? (Laughs softly)<br>
	<br>
	Dying was not very different from living. My babies will never see me again. 
	Or I them. But then, they weren't going to let me see them anyway. (Sobs) Do 
	you think I would have done this if I could comb Sabina's hair in the 
	morning before sending her to school? She liked red ribbons in her hair. Or, 
	if I could make Irfan his favorite macch do piaza? We came from one hell to 
	Mumbai, and now are in our own, little, separate cells. Some day, my babies 
	will understand. And so will my husband. Some day – I don't want that day to 
	come soon - we shall be together as a family. Don't tell my babies that I am 
	gone.(Pleads) Please! Smile for them. Don't cry for me. Help them be brave. 
	They need you, now that I am no longer around...<br>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
	A tiny room at a typical Indian chawl. There is an ancient black and white 
	TV in a corner, a stove burns and Noorie is cooking on it. Enter Aslam with 
	Noorie and Irfan.<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Screaming) Ammie, the headmistress has called Bajan tomorrow. Irfan 
	hit another boy<br>
	<br>
	(Aslam rolls out a mat and sits down resignedly, saying nothing.)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Sternly) What did you do, Irfan?<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Looks down and slowly replies) He said bad things about you. Said 
	that you danced with your clothes off before strange men. He said we were 
	kaffirs because of what you did at work. Said you were a whore<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie's face turns ashen for a moment and then she gets up and goes to her 
	son and hugs him, forcing a smile)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Speaking slowly to herself) Yes...the same kind of whore for whom 
	they are ready to blow themselves up. (Louder, to Irfan) Don't bother about 
	what anyone says. You must study hard and do well in school so that you 
	could become a doctor<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: I don't want to become a doctor. I want to become a policeman. Then 
	I'll be able to hit anyone who says anything bad about you<br>
	<br>
	( Noorie looks surprised and bursts out laughing. She looks at Aslam and he 
	looks at her and turns away. She hugs her son hard and kisses him)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: I found some Hilsa fish in the market today. We don't get it often 
	here. Go change from your uniform, your food will soon be ready<br>
	<br>
	(As the children go out, Aslam speaks. He has a soft voice, that of a broken 
	man)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: The headmistress said that she didn't want you to come to the school. 
	She wants me to drop the children off and pick them up. I'll do that. What 
	else do I do anyway?<br>
	<br>
	( Noorie goes up to him and tries to put her arms around him. He does not 
	respond and looks away. She looks close to tears)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: You haven't touched me since I started working. I don't do this 
	because I enjoy it. If I didn't, none of us would eat. When you do this, it 
	is as if you agree with the boy whom Irfan hit today<br>
	<br>
	(Tears well up in her eyes and she goes back to her stove. Aslam says 
	nothing and just looks down. He does not even move his head once his gaze is 
	downwards. Irfan comes running in, as if in a hurry)<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: Bajan, is India better than Bangladesh? Some of the boys at school 
	say it is<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Resignedly and reluctantly at the same time) Yes, my son, at the 
	moment, it is better for us<br>
	<br>
	(Lights fade slowly and Noorie's voice is heard in the background again)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: That was home. We didn't have much, but we were happy. (Laughs) You 
	don't believe me, do you? (Laughs even more) Well, it's true. We were happy. 
	I was happy. I had my children and I had food for them to eat. That week, I 
	took them to the beach. Irfan enjoyed riding a horse. I love the beach 
	myself. No one stares at me like in the basti or where I worked. Sabina 
	would have corn with masala rubbed on it and Irfan always wanted the golas. 
	I didn't have any money left after that except for the rent. But I was 
	working. Earning money. Living with my family. Sometimes, I even smiled. 
	(laughs and then the laughter turns into sobs as the curtain closes and the 
	voice fades out)</font></p>

	(The make up room at the bar. Noorie and Shanta are getting dressed before a 
	mirror and chatting while they apply their makeup. They wear Indian style 
	cabaret clothing that is mainly several single colored sheets stuck into 
	their underclothes so that they could pull them out one by one when they 
	dance)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (In a half bullying, half tempting voice) Why don't you come with 
	me? You could make much more money on the side. Don't tell me what we make 
	here is enough<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: To me, it is. I have no interest in doing what you do (She applies 
	makeup to her eyes with an eyebrow pencil as she speaks)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Stares ahead for some time, doing nothing, and then speaks, almost 
	spitefully) If you could give the burkha up to do this, what is the big deal 
	about what I am doing?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Closes her eyes. It is clear that she is very angry and is trying 
	to keep her emotions in check as she does not want a fight) Do what you 
	want, Shanta. I live my life and you can live yours. I have no interest in 
	what you do and don;t talk to me about it again<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Still doing nothing, she pauses again and then leans forward to put 
	on some lipstick and then speaks) What do I care? Do whatever you want. I 
	have a scooter now. (Laughs and continues) and a cellphone. And jewelry. And 
	I buy my clothes at the Heera Panna mall<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (completely unemotional) Very good. I hope you buy a car and a home 
	too<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (You can see that she is frustrated. She opens her mouth as if she 
	is about to say something and then stops. Then, slowly, she continues) I am 
	thinking of cutting my hair. I was told that I would look like a college 
	student if I did. These men all like college students a lot<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Relaxed after the exchange) Don't forget to ask Bai before you do 
	anything. You know how particular she is about how you should look<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Gets up and looks at herself in the mirror) So what if she doesn't 
	like me? This isn't the only bar in Mumbai and this isn't the only place 
	where I earn money<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Irritated) Do whatever you want, just make sure it isn't anything 
	foolish<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Laughs nervously) What we are doing – could there be anything more 
	foolish than this? Or, anything more f... (It is clear that she is about to 
	express an obscenity but stops and becomes serious)<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie says nothing but goes up to her and gives her a hug. Enter Bai. She 
	is an older woman, in her fifties and it is obvious that she must have been 
	beautiful when she was younger. You can see that she has an authoritative 
	manner and is firm about what she is doing)<br>
	<br>
	Bai: You're both early today<br>
	<br>
	Noorie and Shanta together: Yes, Bai<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: My bus got here faster than usual and Shanta has a scooter now<br>
	<br>
	Bai: A scooter? Good for you...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Desperately as if she wants Bai to think about something else) Bai, 
	can I cut my hair? People tell me that I would look like a college student 
	if I did<br>
	<br>
	Bai: (Looks at her carefully) Turn your face<br>
	<br>
	(Shanta turns her face first to one side and the looks straight at Bai 
	hesitatingly. Then, she turns her face to the other side.)<br>
	<br>
	Bai: (Approvingly) Yes, you may. Just don't have it cut too short like one 
	of those officers. I don't want you looking older than you are<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Smiles) You made her day, Bai. She was scared to ask you<br>
	<br>
	Bai: (Laughs) It's a good thing she asked. (Turns towards Shanta) Why would 
	I say no to something that would make you look better? (She then addresses 
	both the girls) Have your chai if you want. The other girls should be here 
	soon and we have more than an hour before we start. (Then speaks sternly to 
	Shanta) If you're going to smoke, have some pan or chiclets before you go on 
	the floor. And spray some perfume on yourself. I don't want any of the men 
	smelling smoke on your body or your mouth<br>
	<br>
	(She walks out with the same authoritative walk with which she came in)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (With the defeated voice of someone who hates doing something that 
	she is ordered to but knows that she has to do it) Yes, with all those bast... 
	(stops saying the whole word and continues with vehemence) smoking and 
	drinking in there, what f... (stops herself from saying the swear word 
	again) difference is it going to make if I have a few puffs. It's not that I 
	enjoy smoking. (Her voice trails off) I just have to...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: She gave you the permission that you wanted. Be happy and let's get 
	some chai. Madhuri should be here any moment<br>

	(In the dark, Noorie's voice is heard again)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Yes, Madhuri, my best friend in India. She was the one who got me 
	into this line of work. Do you want to know why I still consider her my best 
	friend? (Laughs) If she didn't, we'd all have died of starvation without 
	being able to do anything about it. At least, when I died, I was able to die 
	because I chose to. Had I died earlier, It wouldn't have been a matter of 
	choice. (Laughs) Look at the choices my life threw me! (Laughs wildly)<br>
	<br>
	(The lights come on to reveal the dressing room again. Noorie and Shanta are 
	drinking tea when Madhuri rushes in. She is a very pretty young woman and 
	her body is that of a woman who has a child. She wears a saree and almost 
	trips as she comes in, picks her dress up<br>
	and goes to a corner)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Mocking her) You needn't be shy about changing before us. We're all 
	going to take our clothes off before strange men in a little while (Laughs 
	mock-ironically)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Shut up! Shanta!<br>
	<br>
	(Madhuri says nothing as she collects her dancing clothes and goes out)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Laughing) What are you mad about? Did I lie about what we were 
	going to do?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Irritated) So what would you do next? Go home naked from here?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Laughs and then turns serious) If I were paid enough, I would ride 
	a donkey home naked from here and then disappear with the money not to be 
	seen again. (Her speech slows) I might even think of a future<br>
	<br>
	(Enter Madhuri dressed in her dancing clothes. She does not seem to care 
	about the casual taunts that Shanta threw her way as she speaks to Noorie)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Good to see you relaxing, Noorie<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: How is the little one?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: She is why I'm late (Smiles) Her father called me<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Not late at all. We're all early<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: I need a cup of tea<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: So, are you still in touch with the bastard?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Don't call him that (Weakly) I was responsible too, and foolish...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Sarcastic) Oh, yes, but his parents are still alive, aren't they? 
	And what is he doing? Studying at university? It was fine when he wanted to 
	stick it inside you but the moment he had to take responsibility, he had to 
	hide behind his parents and his caste Madhuri: (Sounding weak) Some tea, 
	please! Shanta, I know that you mean well and I don't want to argue with 
	you. Life isn't all black and white as you suggest it is, sometimes<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie goes out and brings Madhuri a cup of tea)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Opens her mouth as if she is going to speak and then shuts it. She 
	hesitates a second time and then speaks anyway) So does he send you any 
	money, or do you send him money that you should keep for yourself and the 
	baby?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Why are you always in such an angry mood? Can't you be happy 
	sometimes at least?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: It's nothing, forget it<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (You can see that she's trying to defuse the situation) Shanta 
	wanted to cut her hair and Bai let her<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Really?<br>
	<br>
	(Shanta smiles and looks down)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: You'll look very nice. Just don't cut it too short<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: I was thinking about short, really short, like a college student 
	(Thinks for a moment) Like that American actress in that movie about her 
	dead boyfriend who returns to save her from a murderer<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Look here (Stares at Shanta) I guess you're right, you might be 
	able to pull it off<br>
	<br>
	(Bai comes in)<br>
	<br>
	Bai: You start in 15 minutes. Noorie, you'll go on the floor first followed 
	by Shanta and Madhuri will close up<br>
	<br>
	(Exit Bai)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Sarcastically again) Ladies, get ready. You have a role to perform, 
	to dance with your clothes off amidst strange men. Your work impacts on the 
	future of our great nation and on the society that we live in. If you fail, 
	the world would be doomed to destruction and<br>
	sorrow. Up the world and up the bar dancers, up also the men's dicks as they 
	reach for the sky! The sky is the limit! Glory to our motherland and glory

	It is early in the morning. Sabina, Aslam and Irfan are at home, the 
	children preparing to go to school. Aslam presses the children's clothes 
	with an old coal iron on a bed sheet, sitting on the floor. Noorie goes out 
	with a thin, cheap towel and a soap in her hands, it is clear that she is 
	going to have a bath. Irfan sits on the bed sheet that he slept on, watching 
	his father.<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: Bajan, why does Ammie work at night and come home only in the 
	morning?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (With a dead expression in his eyes) Her job is different<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: What job does she have?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (After a long pause) She works in a hotel<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: Which hotel, Bajan?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (You can see him doing his best to stay calm) The Taj Hotel<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Brightens up) The one by the Gateway of India?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Nervous) Yes, that one<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: If any of the boys tell me that she dances, I'll tell them where she 
	works. (Slows his speech) I won't hit them<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Looking down at the school uniforms that he is ironing): No, don't 
	tell them that. Don't even talk to them. They are bad boys<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Disappointed) But they are the boys in my class. If I don't talk to 
	them, who will I play with?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Don't worry. We'll move from here soon. You'll be in a better school 
	with good children. You won't have to worry about these bad boys<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: But when are we going to move, Bajan?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Very soon. (He folds the clothes that he has been ironing and moves 
	them to a corner) Did you brush your teeth?<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Smiles) Yes, I did, even before Noorie. She takes too long and keeps 
	staring at herself in the mirror<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: She is always ready in time to go to school. You shouldn't talk about 
	your sister like that<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Whispers excitedly as if he's revealing a secret) She says that she 
	wants to become a film actress. She wants to become a heroine. Her friends 
	keep talking about the movies all the time and they all want to wear bright 
	clothes like in the films<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Smiling) All girls like looking nice. And many of them want to 
	become heroines. She has a long way to go before she can decide<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Still whispering) Don't tell her that I told you this or she'll 
	pinch me like she does. Don't even tell Ammie<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (With a forced, serious expression) I won't<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: Promise?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: I promise<br>
	<br>
	(Sabina comes into the room and looks at her brother)<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: Well you can go now. The water is ready<br>
	<br>
	(Irfan gets up, grabs his ironed uniform and a towel and leaves)<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: When will Ammie be home?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Any moment. Her bus must have got delayed<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: I hope there's time for her to comb my hair<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: There will be, don't worry. Both of you are up early today<br>
	<br>
	(Enter Noorie. She looks tired, but happy, and has a big plastic shopping 
	bag with her. Noorie runs up to her and hugs her)<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: Ammie!<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Mock sternly) Let me put these bags down, girl. I've got something 
	special for all of you<br>
	<br>
	(Aslam turns away and says nothing, lapsing into his usual silence whenever 
	his wife is home)<br>
	Noorie: What did you get?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Teasing) Guess...<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Very excited) A pink dress and red ribbons<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Hugs her daughter again) Yes, and some rosogollas for all of us to 
	eat. Go and get me a comb and your ribbons, I must get you ready for school<br>
	<br>
	( Sabina runs out)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (angry) Why do you have to spend money on things like this?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Looking hurt but she forces herself to stay calm) It is for the 
	children. Why am I doing what I do if it is not for them?<br>
	<br>
	(Aslam turns silent and looks away, lapsing into silence after his short 
	outburst, as Sabina returns and sits before her mother with her hair hanging 
	behind her back. Enter Irfan as Noorie starts combing Sabina's hair. He 
	tiptoes silently behind his mother and suddenly grabs her from behind)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Startled, but pleased, speaks to him in a mock-angry tone) Why do 
	you scare me like that?<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Laughing) Because you don't hug me as much as you hug Sabina<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: That's not true<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Angry) You just wait...<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Laughs louder) I can run faster than you. (He speaks to his mother) 
	I know what you got her. What did you get me?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Teases him) She guessed what I got her. Why don't you guess<br>
	what I got you?<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Excited) A Cricket bat<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Very good!<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: No sweets for me?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: The rosogollas are for everyone<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: I want two for myself and only one for Sabina<br>

	<br>
	(The stage is dark again and the sounds of a home are heard in the 
	background. Noorie speaks from the darkness)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: You might wonder how we came to Mumbai. I wonder why we came here 
	all the time. I know how we landed here, but as for as the &quot;why&quot; maybe you 
	could help me understand myself? Go on, try to think about this and help me 
	with your thoughts... I did talk to my children about this as they kept 
	asking me questions all the time...<br>
	<br>
	(Spotlight on Noorie and Sabina standing in front of the curtain)<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: Ma, why did we leave our country? Amar Shonar Bangla they say, why 
	did we leave such a beautiful place?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: It is beautiful, but we are poor. The poor have no country<br>
	<br>
	(The spotlight fades and Noorie's voice continues from the background)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: I discussed this with my friends. Madhuri was the brightest girl in 
	her village. Her parents were hide flayers, the lowest of the low Hindu 
	castes. Everyone at her high school thought that she would do well at 
	university and she wanted to become a doctor herself. She worked hard during 
	the 11th and 12th grades and wrote the exams very well. But the strain was 
	too much for her. She needed a break. And that came in the form of her 
	classmate, Naveen Joshi, a good looking Brahmin boy in her class. The exams 
	ended in february and Madhuri and Naveen began to spend time in each other's 
	company. It was not long before she became pregnant.<br>
	<br>
	(The spotlight comes on again and Madhuri comes and stands beneath it. She 
	has a baby in her arms and is kissing and cuddling it. Noorie's voice 
	continues from the background)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Her parents went to Naveen's parents to speak to them about this. If 
	they didn't, they would still have been alive. The Joshis called Madhuri a 
	whore and told her parents that if they did not leave, they would call a 
	town panchayat and make Madhuri's pregnancy public. That evening, Madhuri's 
	parents took a step that poor Dalit farmers take whenever things become too 
	difficult for them to manage. They ate cupfuls of insecticide and died. 
	Madhuri wanted to do this as well, but Naveen stopped her.<br>
	<br>
	(Naveen joins Madhuri under the spotlight)<br>
	<br>
	Naveen: Our little girl is beautiful<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Half angry, half mischievous) Our girl?<br>
	<br>
	Naveen: (Irritated) Yes, she is ours. Mine...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Sarcastic) I remember hearing you say this before your parents<br>
	<br>
	Naveen: I couldn't do anything other than what I did. I have no money...<br>
	<br>
	(Madhuri cuts him off)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Of course, I am wealthy and my parents were millionaires...<br>
	<br>
	Naveen: (Pleading) I still come to see you, don't I? My parents don't like 
	my doing this but I still do...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Still sarcastic) What you can do with me, you can't with your 
	mother or your father<br>
	<br>
	Naveen: (Goes red but forces himself to become calm and pleads again) I am 
	at university now. In another year, I'll have a job. I'll do something for 
	both of you when I have my own money. I promise...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Laughing) Yes, you will. I'm sure you will. When you want 
	something that you can;t get anywhere else, you'll be here, all right 
	(Laughs even more)<br>
	<br>
	Naveen: (Almost begging) Please come... Let's go to your room...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Mocking him) So, that's what it is. (Laughs) If only you had a 
	condom on, my parents would still have been alive<br>
	<br>
	Naveen: (Sweating) Madhuri, please...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: I wonder when they'll invent a condom for your and other mens' 
	minds (Laughs)<br>
	<br>
	(Naveen leaves and Madhuri goes back to cuddling the baby. Noorie's voice 
	continues from the background)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: We were the best of friends. We laughed together, cried together and 
	when we were away from our children, we did everything together. I did meet 
	her on that day after Naveen left.<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie joins Madhuri under the spotlight. She looks tired and pale and 
	appears preoccupied)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Still cuddling the baby, but smiling when Noorie joins her) What 
	is it? Why are you so serious today?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: I dreamed of my parents, of friends and of relatives I left back in 
	Bangladesh. I can;t stop thinking about them today and I'm forcing myself 
	not to cry<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Keen to change the topic) I heard that Sabina topped her class...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Softly) Do you think about your parents and your friends in your 
	home town?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Very firmly and loudly) NO!<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Even more softly) Your case is different, I guess. India is your 
	own country. You live among your own people...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Loud and sarcastic as moments before) My own country, Noorie? My 
	own people? Is that why I dance with my clothes off before drunk men who try 
	to stick their paws and their money into my underwear?<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie looks down while Madhuri stares at her and the lights fade out. 
	Noorie's voice continues from the background)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Well, let me come back to why I left my &quot;own&quot; country. Aslam worked 
	on our little farm but the sea kept coming closer and closer to our plot and 
	the salt came faster than the water itself. At first the farms closest to 
	the shore became too salty. The salt that made our food so tasty was killing 
	our crops and keeping us from growing anything to eat. And, as the villagers 
	packed up and left one by one, we decided to leave too. Sabina was four and 
	Irfan was a baby. We had to feed them. And then, we had to eat. So, from our 
	little village, we went to the biggest city in our country. Dhaka. There 
	were big houses and bigger slums a little away from them. It was noisy, oh 
	yes, terribly noisy. I thought that it was the noisiest place in the world, 
	but that was because I had not seen Mumbai yet. Aslam began pulling a tonga 
	but that still did not pay enough. At first, we tried something different. I 
	would eat one meal and he would give that meal up, then he would have the 
	next one and I would go hungry and so on. We found that that didn't work. I 
	had to breast feed my little boy. And then this lady told me that thee was a 
	big house where they wanted a servant. They would pay me and also let me eat 
	after the master and the Mistress had eaten. There were just two people. 
	Their children were far away studying somewhere. I wouldn't have much work 
	with just two people in the house, or so I thought... (The curtain opens to 
	show the living room of a fashionable home in Dhaka. Mrs Majeda Ahsan, the 
	mistress of the house, is seated on a plush leather sofa, speaking int a 
	cordless phone. She gesticulates with her free hand as she speaks. She wears 
	a henna type dye in her hair and wears a glittering watch and expensive 
	jewelry with a casual air. Noorie waits by her with a glass of some soft 
	drink on a tray. She looks at her mistress patiently while she speaks)<br>
	<br>
	Mrs Ahsan: (On the phone) I do think that we need to have a signature 
	campaign for the terrible treatment that that poor girl received when she 
	was detained at La Guardia airport. Two hours because her name resembled 
	that of someone on some FBI list! Imagine... (she nods her heads in between 
	breaks as if she is listening carefully to what the other person says and 
	continues) Yes, it is outrageous! I was at La Guardia last year seeing both 
	my children off. Imagine if they did this to me! What do these Americans 
	think they are? Gods? (She pauses to listen to the other person and 
	continues after a while) Of course! I shall get the e-mail as well as the 
	Postal Address of the White House. We did meet the Ambassador at a party 
	last year and I have his personal number. Sure, we'll talk tomorrow after I 
	speak to the Ambassador. (She looks down at her watch) I have to go now. 
	There is a meeting of womens' groups at the Sheraton. (Disconnects the phone 
	and picks up the glass that Noorie is offering her, takes a sip and shouts 
	at Noorie) Don't you know not to expose this drink to air for so long that 
	it's gas escapes? And it is hot as well! Don't you people have any brains? 
	(She looks at the door and shouts) Driver!!!<br>
	<br>
	(Enter her husband. Mr Ahsan wears a suit with a religious cap on his head. 
	He has the henna type dye in both his hair as well as on his neatly trimmed 
	beard)<br>
	<br>
	Mr Ahsan: I have some good news. The Minister was very cordial and told me 
	that he would take care of the complaint that I had spoken to his Secretary 
	about.<br>
	<br>
	Mrs Ahsan: That is fantastic. Yes, it really is! (Looks down at her watch 
	again) I must go, or I'll be late... (Rushes out)<br>
	<br>
	(Mr Ahsan sits down. Noorie stands still waiting for him to say something. 
	He looks ahead for a while, saying nothing, and then commands her)<br>
	<br>
	Mr Ahsan: Get me a glass of cold water. It must be really cold and I want 
	three large ice cubes in it<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie runs out while the sound of a car driving away is head in the 
	background. Re-enter Noorie with the water in a few moments to find Mr Ahsan 
	standing up by the door, which he has quietly shut. She goes up to him and 
	he picks the glass up while staring at her face at first and then at her 
	breasts. She looks down embarrassed and hesitant and is about to leave when 
	he reaches down and grabs one of her hands with his free hand and pulls her 
	to him, holding his forefinger in the hand holding the glass to his lips. 
	Noorie looks shocked and says nothing as her Master pulls her to him, but 
	she struggles and breaks free and stands a little away, still nervous and 
	too scared to run)<br>
	<br>
	Mr Ahsan: don't be afraid. Madam isn't here and I do think that you look 
	very beautiful. (He winks at her while Noorie looks white as a sheet. He 
	continues talking as he slowly walks towards her) Come to me and I'll give 
	you 2000 taka. You are really beautiful... OK, I'll give you more (Slowly 
	advances to her after putting the water down and reaches out to grab her. 
	Noorie's eyes start watering and he speaks to her calmly) No need to cry...I 
	am going to make you happy...I'll buy you a TV next month...<br>
	<br>
	(As he is about to kiss her, the door flies open and enter a furious Mrs 
	Ahsan who rushes and grabs Noorie by her hair)<br>
	<br>
	Mrs Ahsan: You whore! (She starts slapping Noorie and Mr Ahsan does nothing) 
	I'll kill you and your entire family, you whore...(Noorie tries to protest 
	but then she shields herself from the repeated slaps and trips. After she 
	falls down, Mrs Ahsan starts kicking her and that is when Mr Ahsan tries to 
	stop her. Mrs Ahsan then goes to the couch, sits down and starts crying)<br>
	<br>
	Mrs Ahsan: A servant, Ali, a damn servant...<br>
	<br>
	Mr Ahsan: Calm down, Majeda, there is no reason for you to get excited<br>
	<br>
	Mrs Ahsan: No reason, you tell me there is no reason? And excited? Who is 
	excited, you bastard? You're as excited as a dog after a bitch in heat...<br>
	<br>
	Mr Ahsan: Majeda! Don't speak to me like that before a servant,<br>
	please...<br>
	<br>
	(Mrs Ahsan cries and then Mr Ahsan turns towards Noorie who is quietly 
	tearful in a corner of the room)<br>
	<br>
	Mr Ahsan: (In a cold voice) I want you and your family to get out of Dhaka. 
	If I see you anywhere in this city again, I'll kill you, your husband and 
	your children and no one will be able to do anything, do you understand? (He 
	reaches into his pocket, pulls out some money from his wallet and pushes it 
	into Noorie's hands) Get out! Right now! (Noorie runs out of the main door)<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	(It is the inside of a small hut in Dhaka. Noorie is crying while Aslam 
	looks at her. A much younger Irfan is in his arms while a younger Sabina is 
	running around playing)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: I don't know why this happens to us. First our farm and home and now 
	this...<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie just sobs)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Worried) Haidar Mia should be here any moment. He warned me that the 
	lady might try to send people to kill us<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie sobs more quietly and as Sabina goes near her, grabs and hugs her 
	while the child struggles to break free and continue playing)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: I just don't know what to do (He sits down and puts his young son 
	down)<br>
	<br>
	(Enter Haidar Mia. He looks like a religious man, dressed in a starched 
	white shirt and lungi and has a knitted religious cap on his head. His hair 
	is very short and he has a long, flowing white beard)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: As salamu walaikum, Haidar Mia </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Haidar Mia: Walaikum salam<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie stops sobbing and dabs her eyes with her saree. She gets up and goes 
	to the little clay stove in a corner and sits by it)<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: You are all in grave danger if you ask me...<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: I am frightened, Haidar Mia, after you told me this. I spoke to two 
	other tonga pullers and they told me the same thing<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: You know what it is like, Aslam bhai – the rich can always hire 
	people to kill you if they want to (He looks in Noorie's direction and, 
	seeing that she has an expression of suspicion on her face, speaks to Aslam 
	while looking at her) Even if they don't kill you the lady could hire 
	someone to throw an acid bulb on your wife's face. You must have heard of 
	all the acid attacks taking place in Dhaka...<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Even more worried) What do you think we should do, Haidar Mia?<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: (Speaking as if he is doing them a favor) I could help you to 
	escape to India, to Mumbai, which is a very rich city there<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie looks even more suspicious)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: What will we do there?<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: (Still speaking to Aslam while looking at Noorie) Mumbai is a 
	very rich city. Haven't you heard about all the film stars there? Mithun 
	Chakroborty? Sushmita Sen?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Hesitant) Yes...<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: You will easily get a job there. In such a rich city there will 
	always be many jobs. (Lowers his voice as if he is telling them a secret) I 
	know someone who can take you across the border to Kolkata and then put you 
	on a train to Mumbai<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: But...<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: (Acting irritated) Well, decide what you want to do. If you want 
	to risk your own lives and even more your children's, over here, that is 
	your choice. I was only trying to help you. (Looks Aslam squarely in the 
	face) What am I going to gain out of this? Nothing! I am only going to 
	introduce you to people who could take you across and save your lives if you 
	want to go<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Sounding depressed) But we have only been running from one place to 
	another...first from our village to Dhaka and now...<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: (Enthusiastic as he can see that Aslam is hooked) You know how 
	tough the Indian army and police are at the border...they often ask for 
	lakhs of taka for each person they let in, but I know someone who could get 
	you in cheap<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Lakhs of taka? We have very little...<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: (In an encouraging tone) Why are you worried? Didn't I say that 
	I was here for you? What do you have?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Just the papers for my land and some jewelry...<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: (In a condescending tone) Well, normally, my people wouldn;t 
	even look at this, but let me talk to themselves<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Thank you Haidar Mia, Allah will bless you for your help to us<br>
	<br>
	Haidar Mia: May he bless you, too, and save you from danger...(Looks at his 
	watch) I must leave. Keep the papers and the jewelry ready. I'll try to get 
	you across as soon as I can (Gets up and leaves) Allah Hafiz<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Allah Hafiz, Haidar Mia<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Do we have to give up everything that we own?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Shut your mouth. If you didn't get into trouble, we wouldn't have to 
	run away. Can;t you see that Haidar Mia is trying to help us? <br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Is he really?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: You heard what he said – we have hardly anything. What is the agent 
	who takes us across going to give him out of it? They have to pay the Indian 
	army and police...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: I am worried...<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: And I am even more worried than you are. Worried about all of us 
	getting killed or of you ending up with a face burned by acid<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: But...<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: No ifs and buts. We are going. I'd much rather beg on the streets of 
	Mumbai and be safe than live here in danger the rest of my life<br>
	<br>
	(As they argue, the lights go off and the curtain falls. In the dark, 
	Noorie's voice sounds loud again)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: That was how we left the country where we and all our ancestors had 
	been born. That was how we left a land that our greatest poets described as 
	golden and where the Firangs first came when they wanted to establish their 
	empire in India. My husband spoke about begging in a safe place instead of 
	living in fear in our own land. (Laughs) But it was not he who begged on the 
	streets of Mumbai. (Voice breaks) It was Sabina and Irfan...what could we 
	do? We had no money and the children were hungry. They saw other children 
	begging...they didn;t understand the language that the other children 
	spoke...they begged, not for money, but for food in our language. (Sobs) It 
	was Bai who noticed them. She speaks our language. She wondered where they 
	had come from and Irfan led her to us. She bought us food. It was strange 
	food but I had never had food that tasted better...The little ones fell in 
	love with her (Laughs softly)<br>
	<br>
	And then she asked us what we could do for a job. There are no tongas in 
	Mumbai and it would have been impossible for my husband to get a license to 
	drive a taxi. Bai asked the two of us to come to her workplace to decide for 
	ourselves if I would like to work there...(Her voice gets progressively 
	softer) We went...I couldn't believe what I saw...Was Bai asking me to do 
	this? I felt my stomach churn the first time I saw what went on from behind 
	a screen...But we had to eat. We needed a roof above our heads. I needed to 
	see my children in school so that they would never have to go through this 
	again...I did not speak but just nodded my head when Bai asked me if I was 
	willing to do this. My husband spoke even less. Someone who was always happy 
	to chat before this, he hardly spoke after that. You would think that he was 
	dumb if you just met him...He never even said As salamu walaikum or Allah 
	Hafeez when he met someone or wished them goodbye...it was as if he was 
	alive on the outside but dead inside...he couldn't even touch me – his wife! 
	I was a widow whose husband was alive...(Sobs and cries as the scene ends 
	with her sobs fading out)<br>

	watched by the bouncers who stand outside the entrance as if to make sure 
	that they do not prevent anyone who wants to come in. Noorie manages to 
	sneak in from the side and enters the dressing room where Shanta and Madhuri 
	are getting ready for the evening performance)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Sarcastically as always) Did you see those bas...(cuts the word 
	short and continues) outside?<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie just nods and picks her dress up to go into the changing room)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Sadly) I hope they don't frighten the patrons away. That would 
	mean less tips for us...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: Don't you worry, when they're done shouting they just might come in 
	and watch us strip (Laughs)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Sarcastic now) Yeah...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: I'll bet all my money they would love to have one of us dance for 
	them in private (Laughs)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: I'll bet none of them had to starve...<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie comes out dressed in her dance costume)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: What is their problem anyway? We haven't stolen anything from<br>
	them or harmed them<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: I wonder what they think of when they fu..(Cuts the word short)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Sarcastic) about us<br>
	<br>
	(All three laugh)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Angry) I'll bet they close their eyes when they do it with their 
	wives. That way, they could dream of actresses or us or whatever better 
	(Laughs a bitter laugh)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Trying to defuse the situation) Why do we care about them?<br>
	We have work to do...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Haven't you heard? The politicians plan to close all dance<br>
	bars down...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Shocked) All dance bars?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: Yes, the bas...(Stops short)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Why?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: They consider us immoral<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Confused, she sits down as if to digest this information) What have 
	we done to them?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Bitter) If they wanted to do stuff to me to let this go on, I'd let 
	them (Laughs bitterly while the other two are silent)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: They say that we are destroying families and homes throughout the 
	state and want us out of business<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: So what could we do about it?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: Nothing. Get ready to starve (Increasingly bitter)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Can't we do anything about it?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: I've heard that all the bar dancers in the state are planning to 
	protest by marching to the State Assembly<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Would it help in any way?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Your guess is as good as mine...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Everyone of them needs to spend some time at one of our homes. They 
	need to see that we have to do this so we – and our families – could eat. 
	It's not as if we enjoy it...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: Must make them feel powerful and manly to put women who are forced 
	to strip for a living to starve. What great reformers and leaders they are! 
	And when they're in bed, they surely dream about us!<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: The performance will start soon. We must not be depressed...It 
	mustn't show...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Sabina's birthday will be soon. I need to buy something nice<br>
	for her...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: I wish the bastards' dicks rot and fall off...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Mock-matter of factly) If that happened to too many of them, we 
	would close down anyway as we wouldn't have any clients<br>
	<br>
	(All three laugh and hug each other as the lights go out. This time, it is 
	Shanta's voice in the dark)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: Noorie and Madhuri had to do this for their children. Want to know 
	who I do it for? Everyone in my family. My mother thinks that I work as a 
	secretary in this big city. (Laughs wildly) That is why I want to get my 
	hair cut and look like an office worker. No one's going to know, not even 
	Noorie and Madhuri. (Laughs softly) You know, we (hesitates) dancers care 
	for each other. We know exactly what each of us does when we're not at work 
	– who do we talk to other than each other? I don't want my two friends 
	worrying about me. I do go further than they do in my work... (voice breaks) 
	I'd like to stop if I could, but what would I do? I guess the leaders will 
	stop us if they get half a chance... They probably want to keep the best 
	among us to dance for them in private. I'd love to do a lap dance on one of 
	the dhoti types in private or strip out on the street while they protest, 
	just to see what reaction their reaction is! (Laughs wildly and voice fades 
	out)<br>

	mouth)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: When did you start smoking?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Laughs) Yesterday. I like it so far!<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Laughs too) One more good habit?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Mocking) I am the saint here, aren't I? (Laughs) Saint Shanta of 
	the dance bars of Mumbai (Laughs even more)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: You're not a saint, you're an angel<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Incredulous) What did you just say?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Teasing) Don't pretend that you didn't hear what she said. Are you 
	sure you don't want her to repeat it?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Thank you, Shanta, for the dress you bought for Sabina. It is really 
	beautiful but I'm not going to take it home until her birthday. I want it to 
	be a surprise<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Seeming surprised at the compliments) It's nothing, nothing at all<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Now, I want to get you a gift<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: What's this? An exchange? You don't have to do anything in return<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: No, but I want to. I want to buy your mother a saree. I want you to 
	come here early tomorrow so that we could quickly run out and buy one before 
	work. I would buy one without asking you, but I don't know what she would 
	like<br>
	<br>
	(Shanta nods. You can see that she is overwhelmed. Enter Bai)<br>
	<br>
	All three together: Good evening, Bai<br>
	<br>
	Bai: I have some bad news for all of us<br>
	<br>
	(The three girls turn quiet)<br>
	<br>
	Bai: There is a discussion scheduled in the State Assembly on the subject of 
	dance bars. The netas want to shut us down. I didn't think it would go this 
	far, but it does seem as if no one wants to think about us<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: What about the march that was planned?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Bitter) We could all march as much as we want to, but I doubt it 
	would make any difference. No one cares if a few thousand die of starvation. 
	Don't you know, we live in Mumbai? The greatest city in the greatest 
	country, India?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: If the netas fail, I'll deposit half a week's salary in the hundi 
	at the temple near my place<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Laughs bitterly) Who do you think put most money into religious 
	places? The poor. And look at what they get...we get... <br>
	<br>
	Noorie: There must be a way to change this...we need to eat and so do our 
	families<br>
&nbsp;<br>
	Shanta: Who do you think cares? The netas? Come every election and they make 
	loud noises about farmers killing themselves with pesticides. Once the 
	elections are over, they would gladly send pesticides across if they could 
	to whoever criticizes them<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: At least they talk about the farmers and promise to help them. We 
	don't even get talked about...<br>
	<br>
	Bai: I had to tell you this because you may need to have some plans in mind 
	if they do close us down. I also need to tell you to put this out of your 
	minds now. You have to go on the floor in twenty minutes<br>
	<br>
	(Exit Bai)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: We must join the march, all of us...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri and Shanta: Yes, we must<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Laughs) The ban, if it comes into effect, is only going to be in 
	this state. Both of you could easily go to another state and find bars to 
	work in. I'm the one with problems – my family thinks I have a job at an 
	office here (Laughs uncomfortably)<br>
	<br>
	(The lights go out as the curtain falls. In the dark, Madhuri's voice is 
	heard)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: 75,000 of us marched to the State Assembly asking that our right to 
	livelihood not be taken away. An equal number of waiters and other bar staff 
	were also in danger of losing their jobs. What do the netas think? That we 
	love doing what we do? And yet, we have to. We have no other jobs. We have 
	no other way of feeding our families. How long could we keep uprooting 
	ourselves and moving from place to place? Yes, some of the younger ones 
	would go to Dubai or some other Arab country. Some would be forced to do 
	worse. A womens' group tried collecting signatures to ask for help for our 
	lot. They did not say anything about banning dance bars – just asked that 
	those of us whose livelihoods were going to be lost should be helped in some 
	way as we were going to starve otherwise. The banners came out With slogans 
	which said that they would force the mothers of the women speaking on our 
	behalf to strip in public. These were the people that our netas, the great 
	elected representatives of the people of the state of Maharashtra listened 
	to. And the netas agreed with them completely. Because, in just a few weeks, 
	dance bars were permanently closed. Between one set of men who would, at 
	least pay us to strip and dance and another that wanted us to starve and to 
	strip our mothers if we protested that we would starve, we knew which side 
	we trusted. Noorie and I prepared to go to Goa. Shanta did not tell us what 
	her plans were. (Her voice fades and the scene ends)<br>

	Noorie: We have no choice but to move<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	Noorie: If we don't move, they would starve. Schooling is the last of my 
	worries at the moment<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: First from or home to Dhaka and then to Mumbai and now this...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Yes, it isn't easy...<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	Noorie: (Beckoning him) Come here. (Irfan walks up to her and she hugs him) 
	What happened now?<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: It happens all the time. The other children say that we speak funny 
	and that we smell bad...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Calmly though you can see her frustration on her face) You know 
	that's not true...<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: Even they know it isn't. They make fun of what we eat and they still 
	want to share my food every day at lunch<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie and Sabina laugh while Aslam looks up at his son from where he is 
	sitting and then looks down as he usually does)<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Smiling) Wherever we go, we won;t have these boys. They can say 
	whatever they want when we're gone. They won;t even get to share my food. I 
	know they'll be sorry (Sounds pleased)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Exactly! Now, since youlre speaking about food, aren't you hungry? 
	Go, wash your hands, change your clothes and come right here. We have a nice 
	dinner getting ready before I leave to work<br>
	<br>
	(The children rush out to change and Noorie and Aslam speak in hushed tones 
	as if they do not want the children to hear what they're speaking about)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: How do they know?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Do you think they don't know what you do for a living?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: What?<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: They are not stupid. They know everything by now. They feel bad for 
	you but won't show it. They feel worse for me. I spend more time with them 
	than you do and I do overhear them speaking among themselves<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Why didn;t you tell me this before?<br>
	<br>
	(Aslam says nothing at first, then sighs and speaks)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Irfan wanted to know if there was a beach in Goa. Noorie told him 
	that the beach there was better than the one in Mumbai. She even told him 
	that it was so beautiful that many foreigners came there. And then he asked 
	her if we would be going there because we were foreigners in India...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Where do they learn all this...<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Chuckles and looks down again) I told you that they weren't stupid<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: They're a lot smarter than I thought. I hope they study hard and do 
	well. (Looks blankly ahead of her) If they do well in life, what I am doing 
	would be well worth it<br>
	<br>
	(re-enter Irfan and Sabina dressed and in smiles)<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: Ammie could we have a cake for my birthday?<br>
	<br>
	(Aslam looks up as if he is about to say something and then looks down 
	silent)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Sure, I'll get you a nice cake<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: I should have two cakes on my birthday, then<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: I'll pinch you for that<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: Don't care if you pinch me as long as there are two cakes on my 
	birthday and only one on yours (Makes a face at Sabina and she makes a face 
	back at him. Aslam smiles briefly and shakes his head without lifting his 
	eyes off the floor)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Half joking) Must you two always fight?<br>
	<br>
	(Lights dim as the family eat happily. Aslam's voice is heard from the 
	background)<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (In the monotone of a broken man) When we were children and we would 
	laugh or argue at ho9me, my grandmother would always say that by god's will 
	we would continue to do this for a long time. I do wonder, very often, 
	whether that will no longer works? I can no longer laugh with my children. 
	Neither can I remember what I laughed about as a child with my brothers and 
	sisters. What I do remember is that I did laugh, though that, too, is a 
	fading memory these days. I've seen people forget a lot of things when they 
	grow old. Do they forget happy moments because they are going to be with god 
	soon? I am tired. I do wish old age would come and help me forget 
	everything, especially what happened over the past few years. I hope it 
	doesn't take too long.<br>

	(Noorie's home. It is Sabina's birthday and the family are together. A cheap 
	cake stands on a folding stool and the family are dressed in their best 
	clothing. There is an air of excitement and several packages are on a mat on 
	the floor, unopened)<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Almost begging) Ammie, can't I open the gifts now?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Sternly) No, you can't. Some are gifts from people who will be 
	here. Let them come here, you should offer them a slice of cake first and 
	then open the gifts. (Laughs) The gifts won't run away!<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Teasing) Don't let her open them, Ammie. I'll open them after the 
	guests leave<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Angry) You...<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Laughs) Yes, me...<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: (Calmly) Stop it. Our guests should be here any moment. You shouldn't 
	be fighting when we have guests<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: These will be our first guests since we came to India<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Mischievously) What do you remember about our home in Bangladesh? 
	You could neither talk nor walk when we were there<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Angry) You don't remember anything either...<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Arrogantly, knowing that she now has an advantage over her brother) 
	I was much older than you were and am still older than you. (Makes a face at 
	Irfan and continues) I remember going to the beach there. It was not as 
	crowded as our beaches here are...<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: These are not our beaches. Those were our beaches<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Still arrogant) well, we're here now. These are now our beaches<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: No, they're not...<br>
	<br>
	(Enter Madhuri with her baby)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Happy birthday, Sabina! What are you two fighting about?<br>
	<br>
	Sabina and Irfan together: Nothing<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: We always tease each other<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: Yes...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: So how old are you today?<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Glowing) Eleven<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: I'll be eight in three months<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Laughing gently) Very nice...<br>
	<br>
	Aslam: Won't you sit down?<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Thank you (She sits on one of the mats on the floor and puts the 
	baby down beside her. The children rush to look at the baby<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Very nice of you to come Madhuri<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: You knew that I was going to come... (Turns towards Sabina) I have 
	a gift for you but I won't give it to you until I get a slice of cake<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: (Excited) Ammie, can't we cut the cake now?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: You have to wait, Sabina, Shanta Aunty has to come. She has sent a 
	gift for you as you know<br>
	<br>
	Irfan: (Mischievously) I hope she comes late<br>
	<br>
	Sabine: (Pincing him while he laughs) I won;t spare you for that<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Sternly to Irfan) Stop this! It's her birthday today...<br>
	<br>
	(Enter Shanta)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: Happy birthday, Sabina!<br>
	<br>
	Sabina: Thank you, aunty!<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (To Aslam) Salaam Bhai Jaan<br>
	<br>
	(Aslam replies with a quick smile which fades in a moment and says nothing)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Shanta, come sit with me<br>
	<br>
	(Shanta goes and sits beside the baby and coos over it)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (In jest) So, you're not going to wish me, are you?<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Equally in jest) I know how mother and son are – the two of you 
	don't need anyone else. So how could I interrupt your conversation<br>
	<br>
	(They laugh and Sabina goes up to the cake and looks eagerly at Noorie 
	standing by it. The women laugh even more and Noorie gets a knife. Everyone 
	gets up and sings Happy Birthday to You and then Sabina slices the cake with 
	her mother's help and starts handing the slices over to everyone. As they 
	eat, Noorie finally gives Sabina the permission that she wants)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: Sabina, you can open the gifts now<br>
	<br>
	(Sabina and Irfan rush and open the packets together and she then hugs her 
	mother first, then her father and then Madhuri and Shanta. In the distance 
	the siren from a police car is heard. It comes closer and you can hear the 
	sound of heavy booted policemen jumping out of the jeep. Enter one male and 
	three female police officers. The male police officer speaks)<br>
	<br>
	Police Officer: Aslam Mia, you are under arrest for being present illegally 
	in India. Noor-e-Chashmi Begum you are also under arrest for working 
	illegally in India without a work permit<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Looks faint) What about my children...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: Noorie apa, I'll take them...<br>
	<br>
	(She is cut off by the police officer)<br>
	<br>
	Police Officer: Your children are also illegal foreign citizens in India. 
	They will be taken care of by the Indian state and returned to you when your 
	family is deported to your country, Bangladesh<br>
	<br>
	(He handcuffs Aslam and one of the women officers does the same to Noorie. 
	The two other officers take the children who are crying and screaming by now 
	and drags them away)<br>
	Madhuri: (White as a sheet) Why did they have to do that? She was not a 
	thief or a terrorist...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: We aren't thieves or terrorists either but they want to starve us to 
	death. At the very least, she and her family will be fed by the state while 
	they are in custody... (Voice breaks) We will have to continue to do what we 
	have been doing just to eat...(voice lowers into a whisper and fades out) 
	Why can't the netas understand that we too want to live...<br>
	<br>
	(The curtain drops over a shocked Shanta and Madhuri in full light with both 
	women sobbing and hugging each other)<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie is sitting dejected in a womens' prison while other prisoners try to 
	speak to her)<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 1: (She is a plump woman in her 50s with grey hair and speaks in a 
	squeaky voice. You can see that she is popular among other prisoners and has 
	probably been inside for a long time) Why do you keep crying? You're not 
	going to be here very long. The government does not believe in spending 
	money even on Indians. Do you think they'll spend on a Bangladeshi? You and 
	your family will be sent home very soon<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 2: (She is much younger and is skinny with thick glasses) Akka, 
	when we get released from this hell, we'll have to go back to another hell. 
	You'll go back to your country...<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 1: She's right. We'll still be here<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Sobbing) My children, my children...<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 2: (In a consoling voice) Don't worry, Akka, they'll be well looked 
	after. The netas are afraid of the newspapers. They won't let anything bad 
	happen to children<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 1: You know, they even treat us OK. My man used to beat me but we 
	don't get beaten here...<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 2: (Sadly) You're right... I'll have to be ready for beatings when 
	I get out...<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Still sobbing but more quietly. You can see that she is exhausted) 
	Neither of my children can be without me...<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 1: Nor you without them. Yes, I know how you feel. I've been here a 
	long time and I will be here for a long time after you're gone from here. 
	But it will be OK...<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 2: God will take care of them, Akka. If you suffer now, the rewards 
	would be greater<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Calming down) I had the reward of being with my children until 
	recently. I don't need anything beyond that<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 2: Don't worry, Akka. You will have to go to the court soon and 
	they will send you back to Bangladesh. They won't keep you long... You'll be 
	back in your country soon<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Sighs) My country...<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 1: Don't you want to go back?<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Looks down like Aslam used to) I want to go back to Sabina<br>
	and Irfan...<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 2: (Somewhat stern) Crying is not going to help. Maybe you should 
	think about praying...<br>
	<br>
	(Noorie seems to slide down and goes still)<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 1: What happened to her?<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 2: She seems to have fainted...<br>
	<br>
	Prisoner 1: Let's get the warden...<br>
	<br>
	(Lights dim over Noorie lying on the ground and her voice is heard in<br>
	the background)<br>
	<br>
	Noorie: (Laughs) You probably find it funny to listen to me laugh now. Well, 
	it's all over. Over for the moment, at least. But, going back, that was the 
	first time they carried me out of the prison. My stomach had been hurting 
	badly for a few days since I was arrested. I thought it was because I hardly 
	ate. I was used to eating with my children...or with Madhuri and Shanta at 
	the bar...I thought it was hunger. It wasn't. Turns out that something was 
	wrong inside. They took me to a doctor who gave me some injections, took 
	some X Rays and then even too me to a hospital and operated on me. They were 
	trying to keep me alive when I was dying inside. I was dying without my 
	children before me. If they were brought to me I would have<br>
	recovered. Now, I never will...<br>
	<br>
	It turns out that the government was ready to spend money on us. They spent 
	money on my surgery and I guess they spent some on feeding all of us. If 
	they didn't want us to go back to Bangladesh, why didn't they just let us 
	out? I would have had to find some job...if the bars<br>
	were going to be closed all over the country, I would have found myself some 
	other job somewhere else...I could have been a cook or a domestic 
	servant...I only wanted to feed my children (Voice slows) They didn't let me 
	care for my Sabina and Irfan. They took them away from me. They kept me away 
	from them for six months. I knew that I would never see them again. When I 
	came to know this, I died. Yes, I died. (Laughs wildly) I died, I died 
	before I killed myself! I died away from my children, away from my Sabina 
	and my Irfan! I Noorie Aslam died before I killed myself, I died before I 
	killed myself, I died before I killed myself, I died before I killed 
	myself....(Voice fades to a whisper and dies)<br>

	enjoying ourselves whenever we had a little time...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Starts slowly and then speaks progressively faster and more 
	aggressively) She's gone. The bitch! She's gone...she's left us and Irfan 
	and Sabina and her husband...the fucking bitch...she's gone! She decided to 
	leave...didn't want to be with anyone anymore...the bitch! She decided to 
	leave us for good...the bitch! The fucking bitch! The bitch! I wish I could 
	slap her across her face for what she did! I wish I could pull her hair...Noorie, 
	you bitch! (Shouts out the last three words)<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Sobs quietly in contrast and puts her hand on Shanta's back) She 
	decided to take her life. I thought she was the fighter among us...We were 
	the weak ones...She was always so strong...(sobs heavily)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: She was a bitch! She pretended to be strong before us and then 
	decided to kill herself when no one was watching. A phoney! A liar! A bloody 
	liar! A bitch! (Sobs) I love you, Noorie, why did you do this, I love you...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Bitter) Be happy for her. She's gone to a better place. We'll have 
	to dance with our clothes off very soon...<br>

	Shanta: (Serious and calm) We have to go and see Sabina and Irfan...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Would they know about...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Shaking her head) We're not going to talk about Noorie...We'll take 
	them some Bengali food and tell them that the you'll soon be going to 
	Bangladesh<br>
	<br>
	(Madhuri nods)<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: We'll also try to meet Aslam Bhai...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Would they allow us to? They would let us see the children...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: We'll try...we must meet Sabina and Irfan!<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: (Calm and firm by now) Yes, we must!<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: What a bitch she turned out to be...left us to suffer and took the 
	easy way out...(shakes her head) What a bitch! Called herself our friend and 
	went away leaving us by ourselves...went away leaving those poor children by 
	themselves...<br>
	<br>
	Madhuri: Don't keep calling her names...<br>
	<br>
	Shanta: (Angry) You can't stop me. I feel cheated. She called herself our
