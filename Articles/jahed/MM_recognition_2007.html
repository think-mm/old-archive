	<span style="color: #333333"><i>How important is an award or recognition to 
	an individual or a group that believes and promotes the ideals of secular 
	humanism, science, reason and human rights?</i> Taking a careful look at 
	history, we know most pivotal thinkers didn’t do what they did for the 
	temptation of any recognition or reward; recognition mostly came along the 
	way, sometimes when they were alive and often long after they were dead. 
	Let’s take the example of Socrates: almost 2500 years ago he announced, “I 
	am a citizen, not of Athens or Greece, but of the world.” Did he say it with 
	the hope of any award? No; indeed it was risky at that time to make such 
	utterances. Socrates, however, didn’t stop believing and spreading the cause 
	of reason, courage and honesty. And that’s why we are remembering him even 
	today (our act of remembering him is at most a post humus honor, not an 
	accolade though). Yet it’s hard to deny recognition is a natural desire of 
	human mind. It makes us distinct in the eyes of others, we feel special and 
	therefore, happy. For much similar reasons, I felt elated when I heard Mukto-Mona 
	has been awarded Jahanara Imam Memorial Medal 2007. In addition to the joy 
	for getting recognized for the first time officially through a national 
	award, I felt especially proud to think the award carries the name of a 
	woman who is known as the Martyrs’ Mother <i>(Shaheed Jononi</i>) among the 
	people of Bangladesh. This is a woman who reminded an otherwise forgetful 
	nation about one of its most crucial yet incomplete jobs: the trial of the 
	criminals and collaborators of the gruesome genocide that took place during 
	liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971. Jahanara Imama, however, was not just 
	an idle preacher. Despite having suffered from malignant throat cancer, she 
	continued to mobilize the mass and unite all pro-secular and progressive 
	political parties to force the ruling party to initiate the trial of the war 
	criminals. Until her death in 1994, Jahanara Imam firmly believed unless and 
	until we brought ’71 war criminals and collaborators to justice, our dream 
	of a secular and progressive Bangladesh would always remain a difficult job. 
	Rise of political Islam and its militant gurus such as Bangla Bhai gang in 
	Bangladesh during recent years has proved how true Jahanara Imam was!</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><span style="color: #333333">Two:<br>
	</span></b><span style="color: #333333">Speaking one’s mind without a fear 
	or favor had been always a risky endeavor in human history. In ancient 
	Greece, Socrates was poisoned to death for promoting free thinking; Bruno 
	was burned alive, Copernicus was persecuted and Galileo suffered solitary 
	confinement in sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe. Not so long ago, 
	thousands of women were burned alive at stake in Europe through what is 
	known as witch-hunt. “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&quot; was the 
	declared verdict of Christian Church authority in punishing women. Despite 
	all these examples, it’s not difficult to understand why promoting free 
	thinking in Islamic society poses much more risks today that it does in a 
	non-Islamic society. That’s because regardless of its parochial and backward 
	past, Christianity has undergone social and democratic reformation, 
	especially separation of state and church has killed the virulent components 
	of orthodoxy in Christianity. More or less is true with all other religions 
	except Islam. At least we don’t see a counter version of fatwa issuing death 
	sentence as Mullahs did to Taslima Nasrin, Humayun Azad, Ahmed Shariff, 
	Ayaan Hirsi Ali and<b> </b>Salman Rushdie—to mention just a few example of 
	the victims of Islamic Sharia law. </span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: #333333">Therefore, 
	presence of an organization aimed at propagating secularism, reason and 
	science in today’s Muslim society is an urgent need despite all the risks. 
	This was one of the core missions that brought together a few like-minded 
	individuals of Bangladeshi origin under a single platform and Mukto-Mona was 
	born. Prior to Mukto-Mona, News from Bangladesh (NFB) was the only online 
	venue for those handful freethinkers, agnostics and rationalists of 
	Bangladeshi &amp; Bangalee origin. It was 2000; after months of debate, 
	discussion, at last Avijit Roy—one of the most vocal critics on the net 
	against religious superstition and doctrine—took the final initiative and 
	Mukto-Mona was born. In years that followed, Mukto-Mona 
	team was enriched by the contributions of today’s active freethinkers such 
	as Bonna Ahmed (author, <i>”Bibortoner Hat Dhore”</i>),&nbsp;Mehul 
	Kamdar (former assistant editor, the Modern Rationalist, India), Farid 
	Ahmed, Tanbira Talukdar and Ananta (a spirited freethinker in his early 20s 
	only; editor, <i>Yukti). </i></span></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: #333333">With merely 30 
	members Mukto-Mona declared its presence on the net; now it’s not just the 
	number of its members that makes Mukto-Mona distinct; it’s, rather, in other 
	words, Mukto-Mona’s commitment to the motto: <i>actions speak louder than 
	the words.</i> Assuming many readers are already aware of Mukto-Mona’s 
	existence beyond just cyber discussion, I am refraining here from listing 
	out details about works that we have so far done in areas such as 
	secularism, human rights, creating and encouraging awareness about critical 
	and scientific outlook among the &nbsp;South Asian youths—especially those of 
	Bangladesh origin. Interested readers may wish to read details of our 
	offline activities in our website (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="../../">www.mukto-mona.com</a>). 
	Despite generous praise of many of our activities, we like to think we have 
	yet to achieve what we targeted: paving the way for a secular, progressive 
	and democratic atmosphere in South Asian countries. We hope to extend our 
	network in every South Asian country someday. We know our path is not free 
	from obstacles and challenges; yet we shall not falter from our dreams for 
	if we take history as a source of lesson, people of reason and good will 
	never ceased to exist in the face of odds. And as their successors, never 
	shall we!</span></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: #333333">More often than 
	not, radical Islamists react to Mukto-Mona in a language which, when 
	compared, we find strikingly similar to the language in which radical Hindus 
	curse us: “Anti-Muslim,” “Pro-Christian,” “Pro-Hindu,” “Pro-India” are some 
	of the terms which Jihadi and political Islamists use against Mukto-Mona 
	while Hindu fanatics often accuse Mukto-Mona of being&nbsp; “anti-Hindu,” 
	“anti-India,” “sympathetic to Jihadi Muslims” etc. Interestingly, 
	reactionary minds on both sides think Mukto-Mona is a “paid agent.” &nbsp;We, 
	however, take prefixes such as&nbsp; “pro” and “anti” slightly different way: <b>
	we are “pro” of course, if it means a stand for humanity and “anti” for 
	sure, of anything and everything that hinders the sense of reason, 
	compassion and science in people’s mind. Thanks to the fanatics at least for 
	partial understanding of these terms! </b></span></font></p>

	having had a very dedicated team of moderators, advisors, it’s often the 
	presence and encouragement of like-minded readers and writers from all

	<b>People of good sense and will—however small or big in number—always
