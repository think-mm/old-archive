	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reading his passionate yet contradictory defense of the 
	Prophet Muhammed and some of the verses in Quran, a few months ago I asked 
	Raihan in mukto-mona forum, if he could illuminate me about the kind of God 
	he believes in and, if such God was an anthropomorphic entity as we see in 
	Quran and Bible. If I remember it right, he said he didn’t believe in a 
	Quranic/Biblic God. Yet he was a believer, although he didn’t describe 
	features of his own God and remained silent saying he cannot illuminate 
	others when he’s in search of an illuminated individual himself. I was 
	impressed to hear that as I believe, although the question if God exists is 
	a time aged riddle in the history of philosophy, that not necessarily is a 
	valid point for giving up the debate. As I followed more and more of 
	Raihan’s arguments in favor of Prophet Muhammed, Quran; I, however, started 
	losing interest in his articles/rebuttals until recently when I read one 
	titled “<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/raihan/Theism_and_Atheism.pdf">Astikota 
	Ebong Nastikota: Ekti Bishleshon</a>”<sup>*1 </sup>(‘Theism and atheism: an analysis’). 
	Apparently, I hoped Raihan would not care so much about winning the theist 
	vs. atheist debate as he would about maintaining the honesty, consistency 
	and objectiveness in such a debate. But I was disappointed. I found his 
	arguments—contrary to his claim ‘a first time ever refutation of some of the 
	logics demonstrated by the atheists’ (in response to Avijit’s mail in m-m 
	forum)—more characterized by ignorance, lack of scientific analysis, 
	self-contradiction and just-a-matter-of–convenience type logic. His analysis 
	is anything but scientific. Although I wish I could demonstrate fallacy of 
	all his arguments step by step, I am unable to do so due to time constraint 
	(Raihan should not assume, this is another ‘common excuse’ by the atheists) 
	and fear that readers will find it lengthy and boring. Therefore, I will try 
	to touch upon only some of the core fallacies of his arguments. I shall 
	quote Raihan in English translation. He should correct me, if I misquote him 
	anywhere. Let’s get to the points. </font> </p>
	<p align="center"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><u>Examples of ignorance in Raihan’s analysis</u>
	</font> </b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">1.Ambiguity about the concept of God: 
	</span>In a nutshell, Raihan’s whole argument revolves around defending a monotheistic version of 
	God, which he thinks is a much better and superior option than an atheist’s 
	stand of ‘no God.’ The biggest problem, however, is ‘God’ is one of the most 
	ambiguous terms in English as no two persons may mean same connotation by 
	the word ‘God.’ He tried to show he is aware of the problem. Sadly, he has 
	totally failed in his attempt. The connotations of the word ‘God’ that Raihan is 
	familiar with seem to be just two: a monotheistic and a polytheistic one. We 
	however know this is not always the case. For example, I doubt if Raihan 
	knows about Spinoza’s concept of pantheism, which is a stark contrast from 
	the views of God held by either a monotheist, or a polytheist. Similarly, 
	Raihan doesn’t seem to know it even himself what he’s talking about when he 
	quoted Einstein in defense of a monotheistic God. Does he know, Einstein 
	didn’t believe in a ‘personal God’ (one who punishes his creatures by 
	burning alive in hell, etc) and Einstein’s concept of God doesn’t include 
	any afterlife. Yet Einstein didn’t have any problem to appreciate the 
	majesty of nature and the universe, like when he said: I don't try to 
	imagine a personal God; it suffices to stand in awe at the structure of the 
	world, insofar as it allows our inadequate senses to appreciate it. 
	<span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #FFFFFF">To the 
	contrary, Raihan clearly mentioned he believes it’s quite possible that God 
	might have emotions like anger and love at the same time (“why not?” he 
	asks). So how can Raihan equate his own concept of God with that of 
	Einstein? Is it just because Einstein also used the word God when he said 
	“God doesn’t play dice.”? If so, how is then Raihan different from those 
	uneducated Muslim/X-tian/Jewish Mullahs? </span></font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Similarly, Raihan has continued his lengthy gibberish 
	without ever realizing, just like its counterpart, the word ‘atheist’ also 
	mean a wide range of people (freethinkers, agnostics, skeptics, secular 
	humanists, etc) who don’t believe in an organized religion or belief system. 
	I have yet to meet an atheist who says ‘there is absolutely no working and 
	background force behind the mystery of the universe.’ Except for a few, it’s 
	the scripture based and anthropomorphic description of God and the universe 
	that the atheists don’t agree with. For example, most of us from Bangladesh 
	knew late Prof. Ahmed Shariff as a hardcore atheist. But in his last 
	interview with (late) Prof. Humayun Azad, Shariff, upon being asked by Azad 
	if he believed in religion, replied, ”there may be a creator, but the 
	scriptures are man-made and I don’t believe in the afterlife.”<sup>*2</sup>
	<b>Whose view 
	is scientific in this case? Prof. Sharif’s view or a Raihan’s argument 
	making frequent use of the word ‘God’ but without ever mentioning if such 
	God is indeed a matter, or an organism, or just an energy? What’s the basis 
	of Raihan’s silly assumption about an atheist’s stand on the question of 
	God? I wonder. </b></font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Despite being aware of the difference, Raihan went out of 
	context in citing Stephen Hawking in favor of his weak argument when he 
	said, Stephen Hawking has pointed out to the ‘God’ as one of the causes 
	(toward the universe having a starting point and being created possibly from 
	the outer universe). 
	<span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #FFFFFF">May I ask Raihan, who told you Hawkings meant a ‘God’ 
	here; and even if he did, how are you sure it’s the same ‘God’ that you and 
	your friend believe in? Is it an example of intellectual dishonesty or pure 
	ignorance? </span></font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Logical fallacy: 
	</font> </b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">a) Raihan thinks- belief in God is not a blind belief and 
	it is nothing like a belief in a horse’s egg—a blind belief by all means, as 
	Raihan puts it. Clearly, this is not always true. Indeed, the contrary could 
	be true. Look at the example below: </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Imagine a person who has never seen or heard of a horse 
	in his whole life and is totally blank about it. Only information we provide 
	him is that- a horse is an animal. Now if we ask him, does a horse lay egg? 
	What will he answer? Unless he’s supplied with further details such as a 
	horse is also a mammal and mammals don’t lay eggs, how can that person rule 
	out the possibility the horse doesn’t lay eggs because he knows some animals 
	such as birds do lay eggs? In this case, if the person believes horse’s egg 
	indeed exists, I won’t call this a blind belief, rather, a lack of 
	information. To the contrary, in case of belief in God, we don’t even have 
	preliminary information such as if the God is a He or She, an 
	anthropomorphic figure or just a non-existent entity. What can I base my 
	belief on other than those so called ‘indirect manifestations’, which are 
	far from a concrete term like ‘an animal’ in the previous example? 
	Therefore, belief in God, as a logic, is worse than belief of the person in 
	the above example that a horse lays eggs since it’s an animal. In the former 
	case, we are totally blank; but in the latter, the person is not saying 
	something blindly. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">b) Following is what Raihan thinks proves- sticking 
	merely to logic may make even Einstein ‘a donkey.’ </font> </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">“A donkey has no beard. But a donkey is no human! 
		Einstein didn’t have beard, thus he was not a human but a donkey!” 
		</font> </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Clearly, 
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Raihan’s unstated premise here is every human 
	has beard; seriously erroneous in itself and probably, would serve as a good 
	indicator of who the real donkey is. Certainly, it is not the Einstein!
	</span></font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">c) Raihan cites what I shall call ‘borrowed’ arguments 
	(from the evangelists?) which have been already well refuted and answered by 
	the atheists. They are-“science doesn’t know everything,” “one need to be 
	omniscient (all-knowing) before dismissing the existence of God and an 
	atheist is not omniscient,” etc. </font> </p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let me address these
