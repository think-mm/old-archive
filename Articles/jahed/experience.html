  pride in their first identity as a member of the mankind. Even to date, mankind is divided
  into so many factions under identities defined by race, religion, nationality, etc. Not so
  long ago, I myself also took pride in my first identity as a Muslim. It was
  Islam that defined my personal identity of who I am, my daily activities and
  my morals. It went as far as regulating from what kind of food I should eat
  to what kind people I should make friends with. How sad it is to realize-
  I've spent so many years of my life under an ideology which is authoritarian,
  gender-biased, dogmatic and highly provincial in its outlook toward humanity.
  I will provide solid basis for saying so about my ex-religion. But before

	<span lang="EN-US">Birth
  and My Family:</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> I was born in 1973 in a middle 
	class Muslim family in Bangladesh. My parents had named me after Islam’s 
	prophet Mohammed. My name, therefore, is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Mohammed Jahed Ahmed</i>. ‘Ahmed’ is also another name of 
  	Prophet Mohammed. It is a widely held belief among Muslims that, if a person is named
  after the prophet, in the<i> 'after life'</i> on <i>'the day of judgment'</i>, Prophet
  would recommend him/her to Allah for entry to paradise. I lost my father when
  I was just two &amp; half years. So I'm not able to recall any personal memory with him,
  but from what I heard from my mother, relatives and all the acquaintances of
  my father- he was a very benevolent &amp; religious man. And so was my mother who 
	passed away a year ago. I've three elder brothers and one sister, who is oldest. In terms of
  their positions in Islam, my mother, all my brothers and sister, possibly
  belong to ‘mainstream Muslims,' who are not only mistaken about their
  beliefs in Islam, but often are torn between the modernity on one side and a 
	doctrine belonging to the 7th century Arab peninsula on the other side. (All religions, more or less, are constraints to the spirit of 
	freedom of inquiry and an independent conscience, yet here I'd limit myself 
	to Islam only because of my background). I will save more comments about 
	the ‘mainstream
  Muslims' for a later time.</span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-US">My
  Childhood/Adolescence Period (1973 to 1992) as a Pious Muslim Boy: </span></b><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Up
  to the age of sixteen or seventeen, I spent time in my village. My childhood education
  started both in the school and mosque simultaneously. From the age of six, I
  started going to the government funded primary school in the village for primary education, and
  to the mosque in the neighborhood for Islamic education. I will mainly focus on
  Islamic education that I received in mosque from the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulana</i>
  (a Muslim priest, we called him 'hujoor'). My Islamic education consisted of lessons on reading,
  reciting and occasionally memorizing verses, <i>suras, </i>of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
	the Quran. </i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">B</span>esides, we were taught- how to perform Islamic
  rituals like daily five time prayers, how to eat, bath and do toilets in an 
	Islamic way; then fasting for a month in a year dictated
  by the Islamic calendar, performing Muslim funerals etc. A significant portion of
  our Islamic education consisted of listening to the fabricated and passionate stories of 
	the Prophet
  Muhammad’s life and sayings <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(Hadeeth</i>).
  We were reminded every now and then - <font color="#800000"><b><i>Islam is the truest religion, there is no
  God but Allah; Prophet Muhammad is Allah’s last messenger, and Quran is
  Allah’s message toward mankind through His messenger. </i></b></font>We were 
	often told
  about stories focusing supernatural abilities of Prophet Muhammad (e.g.
  Prophet Muhammad’s meeting with Allah during an event known as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Miraj;
  </i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>stories about how Prophet
  received Allah’s instructions through angel Gabriel etc). Any person even
  with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>slightest trace of a doubt
  in these stories, we were told, lacks <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Iman</i>, which constitute first of the five main pillars of Islam. All the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulanas</i>
  and pious Muslims I knew thus created a kind of impression of 
	Prophet Muhammad in my mind,
  which was mixed with fear, respect and awes. Many considered it not only inappropriate,
  but also sinful to think of Muhammad as an ordinary human being. <i>How could he
  be an ordinary person, who has shown so many supernatural activities </i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(Mujejas)?</i><i>
	</i>– we heard from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulana </i>and other
  orthodox Muslims. On one occasion, we were told, with mere raise of Prophet’s index
  finger, the whole moon broke into two pieces!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">‘Still, non-believers didn’t
  have faith in him,’</i> said <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">the Maulana</i>.
  We were told, only Muslims shall enter the heaven after death (among them, first,
  would enter those, who have lived their lives as true Muslims). We were repeatedly told-
  among the Allah’s cursed people and serious enemies are the idol-worshippers (Hindus), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nasara </i>(Christians),
  and Jews. As we were being told, often the narration was supplemented by tales from 
	the Prophet’s life; things he said about these groups of people,
  and the troubles Prophet faced from such people during his life time. We were
  told- idle worshippers (Hindus), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nasara</i>
  (Christians), and Jews are the enemies of Islam, and we should always keep
  distance from them. I remember, on more than one occasions, we were punished 
	by the Maulana for
  attending the Hindu village fair <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(Rat Jatra).</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;I 
	h</span>ad yet to meet any Christian or Jew in person, and only
  occasionally saw some Hindus. But every time I saw them, I kept a safe distance.
	<i>Ah! only if I could convert just one of them to Islam!&nbsp; </i>
	Sometimes I thought.<i> </i>We were warned
  repeatedly to be alert- so as never to commit <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sheerk,
  </i>the gravest sin in Islam, which means, equating Allah with any other
  entity. <font color="#800000"><b>Since Hindus believe in many Gods/Goddesses 
	(polytheism), they are among the most dangerous
  sinners in the world, we were told.</b></font> And since Hindus commit <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sheerk,
  </i>unlike for Muslims<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">,</i> you cannot
  wish eternal peace for a Hindu, not so even upon his/her death. If we heard
  the death of a Muslim, we were taught to recite an Arabic prayer (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Inna Lillahi Oa Inna Ilahi Rajeon</i>), which is totally different from
  what we would recite upon hearing the death of a Hindu <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">(Fee nari jahannama khalidin- </i>wishing eternal hell fire!<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">).
  </i>As for Christians and Jews, we were told, even though their scriptures
  (New &amp; Old Testament in Bible) once contained words from the Allah through
  authentic Prophets, whom Quran and Muhammed acknowledge; nevertheless, they (Christians
  and Jews) have deteriorated their scriptures, don’t have faith in Muhammad,
  and therefore, are not true believers!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Girls
  were instructed to cover their body and put veils on heads, according to
  Islamic ways. I clearly remember having heard from 
	<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulana</i>
  on one occasion that, a woman who doesn’t cover her body and put veils on
  head, is like a peeled off banana sold in the open market. 
	<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">If a peeled off banana is sold in the market, would you buy it? </i>asked the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulana</i>. 
	<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">So is a woman without coverings! No body is going to like her.</i> This is what constituted my childhood Islamic education.
  Needless to say, I took all such sayings and instructions in plain faith, and
  never doubted it for all the people in my world were Muslims at that time. I
  was quite pious myself. I said five times prayers and recited Quran almost on a daily
  basis. Often I thanked Allah for having created me as a Muslim. I will give
  one more example to illustrate- how <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulana’s</i>
  teaching shaped my views about other religions. Starting from third
  standard, we had a subject called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dharma 
	Shikhsa ('Religion
  Study') </i>in our school. For us, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Religion
  Study</i> meant Islamic studies since there were no Hindu students in our
  class. Since question papers were not made by our own school teachers, rather,
  by a group of teachers of the local <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Thana</i>
  (police station), same set of question papers were sent to different schools,
  of which some had Hindu students. Therefore, the question paper on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Religion
  Study</i> had two different sections. First half was on Islam and second
  half was on Hindu Religion. During exam, once we were handed over question
  papers, the first thing we, the Muslim students, would do was crossing out
  questions on Hindu Religion. We crossed out the Hindu section such a way that
  almost nothing would be readable thereafter. We did so this because we
  thought, even looking at questions on Hindu Religion was a great sin!&nbsp;<o:p>
  L</o:p>ater in
  life, after being doubtful about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulana’s</i>
  teaching, I tried to learn the basis of such parochial and dogmatic views, and
  I found my answer in Quran itself. I will come to that later.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify; line-height:200%">
	<font face="Garamond"><span lang="EN-US">In 
  1990, I finished my secondary education (SSC), left my village and went to Dhaka, 
	the capital city, to pursue higher secondary (HSC) education.
  There I stayed for about two and half years, again as a faithful Muslim. Of course, shifting
  from a small village to the capital city was a remarkable event, and
  I learned a lot of new things previously unknown to me, nevertheless, nothing
  happened in my life to reevaluate my Islamic beliefs. For example, now I
  studied in a famous Christian Missionary College and met many Christian and
  Hindu teachers and students; however, I remained very much a
  ‘mainstream Muslim' with the typical basic beliefs such as- Islam is the
  truest religion in the world, Quran is Allah’s words and Prophet Muhammad is
  Allah’s true messenger. Another important concept that was repeatedly
  installed into our mind by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulana</i>
  and all the Muslims I knew was sentiment of Muslim <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Umma,
  </i>which means all fellow Muslims are my
  brothers and sisters, and I must always pray for them. All the Islamic
  gatherings I attended would end up with a passionate prayer <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(Doa)
  </i>and it was about the well being of all Muslims in the world<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">.</i>
  I don’t recall even a single event that included prayer for any non-Muslims! Whole prayer revolved around the benefits of Muslim
  brotherhood. Yet cracks in my Islamic beliefs didn't start to appear
  until I went to India for higher studies.</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

  Stay in India (1993 to 1998)--Beginning of Skepticism:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span></span></b><span lang="EN-US">Staying in India for five long years is one of
  the most significant events in my life. It was in India when I experienced my
  first love, memory of which I cherish to date. Often, the name ‘India’ gives me
  feelings of nostalgia, more than the word ‘Bangladesh’- my own country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I met quite a few very decent, liberal and caring people; we became
  good friends and are so till now. Again, it was in India, for the first time
  in life, I experienced and was taken aback by the anthropological, cultural
  and religious diversity of human beings. So many people of such a diverse
  nature, so many cultures, so many language; yet it is a single country! My
  acquaintance with such amazing diversity of people and their culture in India played an
  important role in later development of humanist philosophy in my mind. Of my
  five years of stay, I spent first three years in Bangalore, the capital city of Karanataka, a
  south Indian state, and next two years in Mysore, another well known and 
	historic&nbsp;town in
  Karnataka state. I need to
  elaborate a bit about my first love as this experience is related to
  later development of the skepticism in my mind.</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify; line-height:200%">
	<font face="Garamond"><span lang="EN-US">It was while I was in Bangalore
  doing my first year of B.Sc course, I fell in love with a school going Hindu
  girl living in the neighborhood. I had a small motorbike and it was probably July,
  1993: just two months ago we came to India. We, the five Bangladeshi
  students (three Hindus, two Muslims), rented a house in an area which was 
	within the 2-3 kilometers distance from our college.
  One day afternoon, after the college, I was roaming on my motorbike with my 
	roommate on the backseat. We were simply watching the residences, shops, 
	people in the neighborhood and thinking how they were different than what we 
	saw back home. I saw a girl on the roof of a house, near
  by the Hindu temple, located just a two blocks down the road from our
  house. I don’t know why, I got off my motorbike, kept staring at the girl for 
	quite sometime and was not feeling to turn my eyes away at all. She was not any 
	beauty queen or the kind of heroin we see in popular Hindi films. She was 
	just a plain girl in plain attire and was looking at us with her friend 
	standing next to her. Yet I seem to have lost myself in 
	her plain beauty. I experienced what people call ‘love at the first sight’.
	<i>This girl has been created just for me.</i> I took delight in 
	thinking so. For days and
  nights she was in my mind, often appearing in dreams. I gave her the 
	nick <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ROJA</i>,
  after the title of a south Indian super hit film at that time, which was based
  on a romantic love story between a Muslim girl and a Hindu boy. 
	<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">I found out </span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Roja</i> was a student of ninth standard in the local school (Auden High 
	School, Banashankari 1st Stage, Bangalore). Within a
  few days, I got it all by heart- time she would go to school at, her returning
  time from the school, and the time when she would go to the temple in the evening, 
	often with her friend. I followed her silently for two years without daring to talk to
  her. At last one day after two years, I followed her to the school in a bus
  with the courage of a close friend of mine, who accompanied me to her school.
  I talked to her and liked it very much. She herself also appeared to be
  interested in me. A month went by, I didn’t let her know- I was from
  Bangladesh. Instead, I said, I was from West Bengal, a province of India,
  where people speak same language as people do in Bangladesh. After a month, I
  disclosed my real identity and said, I am a Bangladeshi Muslim. After two weeks,
  she declined to continue relationship on the ground that an uncle of hers has
  seen her with me and informed her parents. It should be mentioned
  that her parents were south Indian Brahmins--known to be very orthodox
  among Indian Hindus. To date I wonder, why did she withdrew herself from the relation? 
	Is it
  because once she learned I was a Muslim from Bangladesh, she didn’t see
  much hopes in our relation? Although she was not an orthodox girl herself, her
  parents were and so was her society. Later, when I told my brother and mother
  about this incident, I was rebuked for being so close with a 'Hindu girl.' My
  first love ended painfully leaving a big question in my mind. Why did it happen that I--despite being a Muslim--fell in love with a Hindu girl, and that too, so passionately?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Why did I feel so much for her when there were so many other girls 
	elsewhere?
  Why couldn’t my religion stop me? Is then what people say right, meaning- love is blind and doesn’t 
	care about the boundaries of race,
	religion and country? So only rational explanation I came up with was--for a 
	young boy of my age, falling in love with a young girl is very natural, 
	there is nothing wrong with it since we both are
  humans with emotions. It's not love but the religion which must be artificial, 
	I 
	thought. Unlike my affiliation with religion where many people influenced 
	me, no one induced me to love Roja. It just happened because we bothl are 
	humans.</span></font></p>

  the creator Allah and others call <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bhagwan</i>,
  or God?</b></font><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font color="#800000"><b>&nbsp;</b></font> </span>Is the religion man made
  then? Rudimentary signs of skepticism started developing in my mind. However, I still
  didn’t start to scrutinize my religion. In the meantime, while in college, I made some
  very great friends and many of them happened to be Hindu Brahmins (others were
  non-Brahmin Hindus). We became very intimate. Often I would go to
  their houses and spend time. Some of my friends’ mothers reminded me very
  much of my own mother left in Bangladesh. Their love and affections toward
  their son and his friend (me) , every day concerns, asking repeatedly for
  God’s favor for the well being of their children, etc were just like those of a
  Bangladeshi mother. I will give one example. After purchasing a new
  motorbike, my land lady wouldn't let me ride it second time without ensuring that I’ve first
  sought Goddess' blessing for a safe ride! She performed a small <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">puja</i>
  (a Hindu ritual) on my new motorcycle. I
  sought an answer to the question: why did she ask me to perform a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">puja</i> when she knew- I was a Muslim &amp; didn’t believe in such
  thing? Only explanation was: she loves me just like her own son and doesn’t
  want me to be deprived of God's/Goddess’ blessing. She did- what she believed 
	is the best
  for me. I realized- beyond the layers of religions and customs, she
  too is a mother, just like my own. From a close distance, I observed many
  Hindu customs and rituals. But in a lot of ways, south Indian Hindu customs
  and traditions were different than those we saw among Bengali Hindus. I participated in
  many Hindu festivals and ceremonies. Even for me, Hindu events like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Hooli</i> (playing with colors), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dewali,</i>
  became matters of great celebrations. In August 1996, I finished my B.Sc
  degree, left Bangalore for Mysore, which is some 135 Kms away from Bangalore.
  There also I made quite a few very good friends. When we finished first year
  of our Master’s program (1996-1997), our class went on a month long all India trip. That
  was very recreational and educative. For a month, teachers, boys and girls
  were together. We ate together, slept together and had chats, fun
  together. Previously, I went on a short trip while I was in Bangalore. To date, some of my best
  friends are from India. My acquaintance and practical experiences with
  Indian friends made me realize- there are good people in every religion and
  culture. It gave rise to certain questions in my mind. My own experience came
  in clear contradictions with what I often heard about Hindus &amp; their religion back home. I asked
  myself, are the views of many Muslims about Hindus right? I remember having
  being warned by my mother, prior to my every departure to India: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">“son, always remember, that’s a land of Hindus! Always be cautious
  while dealing with Hindus. You're a Muslim boy all alone. They could kill you 
	(given your argumentative nature).</i>”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;Though 
	I know </span>it’s just a popular misconception, I wonder, does Islam itself hold
  	a favorable view of Hindus, and believers of other religions? I felt very
  helpless to recall my <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maulana’s</i>
  teachings: Muslims can wish peace only for Muslims. If a Hindu dies, the immediate
  reaction of a pious Muslim should be to wish him/her eternal hell fire! I don’t care so
  much about other Hindus as I do about those I’m close to. How could I wish
  hell fire, God forbids, say, if I hear,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
	<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Naganand,</span>
  my dear friend, or Biswarup, a long time buddy of mine, has died? How could <i>the truest religion in the world
	</i>hold
  such a parochial and misanthropic view? Are not Hindus human beings too? Then, is
  it because religion is man made, and therefore could not succeed in overcoming
  typical human selfishness and chauvinism such as wishing and doing good to the members
  of one’s own community only (‘racial prejudice’)? During the last two
  years of my stay in India, my mind remained preoccupied with all such
  questions. <font color="#800000"><b>All these I am saying not to imply that all the Hindu people I met

	fanatics too in India. Nevertheless, I couldn’t help
  asking myself: why do I belong to a religion whose teachings contradict with
  real life experience?</b></font><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b>&nbsp;</b></span>I 
	would not elaborate more about my experiences in India except that it was 
	during last three years (1995 to 1998) of my stay in India, when I started 
	being skeptical about Islam. It was a powerful but a silent storm within my 
	mind. I sought
  explanations for some of the contradictions about religions I faced in India only at a later
  stage. In July, 1998, I finished my Master’s degree in Biotechnology with 
	first class distinction and left India

	(1998-2000)--My Faith Becomes Shaken:</span>&nbsp; 
	</b>I came back to Bangladesh and started preparing myself 
	for graduate studies in the USA. From mid July 1998 to mid July 2000, I was 
	in Bangladesh.&nbsp; At that time, I started collecting books on philosophy, 
	mostly written in Bangla. I learned about rationalism, atheism, skepticism 
	and was particularly attracted by the writings of <b><i>
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://mohaguru.humanists.net/">
	Aroj Ali Matubbor</a></i>,</b> a self–made Bangladeshi Philosopher with no 
	academic training or background. I was happy to learn there are others who 
	also don’t take religious teachings in plain faith. <i>Aroj Ali’s</i> books 
	were interesting, provocative but his style was more like Socrates— not to 
	draw any ultimate conclusion about a topic himself but to leave the readers’ 
	with a question in mind. It was like a ‘compare and contrast’ approach. He 
	would question and discuss validity of many Islamic theories, rituals 
	alongside their rationalistic explanations. I believe this was a brilliant 
	style to avoid attacks from the mullahs. For example: <i>Aroj Ali </i>asked,<i> 
	is it possible for a single individual to be the kindest and the most just 
	at the same time?</i> According to him, a person sticking to justice can’t 
	always indulge in kindness, or the kindest person always cannot be the most 
	just. But we know, according to Quran, Allah is said to be the kindest and 
	the most just! </font></p>
	<p align="justify" style="line-height: 200%">
	<span style="font-family: Garamond">Another 
	humanist and rationalistic iconoclast of the time was late Professor Ahmed 
	Shariff of Dhaka University, Bangladesh. I must admit, I was heavily 
	influenced by his writings, which univocally emphasized reason over blind 
	faith. Not so surprising, in Bangladesh he was declared a <i>‘Murtad’</i> 
	(nonbeliever and an enemy of Islam) by the <i>Mullas</i> (Muslim clergies). 
	Like <i>Aroj Ali</i>, Professor <i>Shariff</i> also donated his dead body 
	for Medical research through will prior to his death. After Prof. Shariff 
	died in 1999, I collected books by him, read them, and also I read articles 
	on him written by others. <b>
	<span style="background-position: 0% 0%; color: maroon; background-image:none; background-repeat:repeat; background-attachment:scroll">One thing struck my mind 
	very much: even those who disagreed with his opinion on religion admitted - 
	Prof. Shariff&nbsp; led a thoroughly&nbsp; honest life. I couldn’t help asking myself 
	a question: Prof. Shariff, beyond doubt, was an atheist; yet he was an 
	honest man. Doesn’t it imply- one can lead a decent &amp; honest life without 
	sticking to religion?</span></b> I kept thinking about the issue for several 
	days. If there was an afterlife as Islam &amp; other religions say, Shariff, for 
	sure, would suffer the eternal hell fire, but would it be fair? I pondered. 
	&nbsp;Why should an honest man be punished so severely by Allah the most 
	merciful, the omnibolent? Is it just because Shariff didn’t lead a life 
	according to Allah’s prescription? I didn’t find any satisfactory answer. 
	Another rationalistic writer who influenced me heavily was
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/prabir/">
	Prabir Ghosh</a> of Calcutta, India. His wekk known Bengali book, <i>
	“Aloukik noy, Loukik” (“Natural, not supernatural”)</i> is full of 
	scientific and rationalistic explanations for many so-called miracles and 
	supernatural phenomena. Other Bangladeshi writers whom I had read, and who 
	were critical of Islamic ideology were late Prof. Humayun Azad, author 
	Taslima Nasrin. By then, Taslima Nasrin was an internationally well-known 
	feminist writer. It should be mentioned that, like Professor Shariff, Mullas 
	declared Taslima as well a <i>‘Murtad’</i> and issued fatwa (ruling based on 
	Islamic laws) against her (still there is a big bounty for her head). I 
	started losing faith in Islam. At home, often I was rebuked for not saying 
	prayers by my mother and brothers. My mother at that time commented, “<i><span style="color:red">I 
	made a great mistake by permitting you to go to India! Now I understand what 
	Hindus have done to you!”</span></i>&nbsp; Fortunately, a nephew of mine was a 
	Master’s degree student in <i>Social Studies.</i> At secondary school, he 
	was a classmate of mine and we are of same age. I had discussed with him 
	many philosophical issues. We discussed together Plato’s famous <i>Republic</i>, 
	how Plato’s views had influenced later Christianity, how Aristotle, a long 
	time student at Plato’s Academy, differed from his master through 
	rationalistic explanation of nature and human mind, etc. As for the Islam, 
	we both concluded, Quran is a modified extension of Old Testament. Thus I 
	spent my time in Bangladesh after retuning from India. </span>

	Interestingly, I didn’t at all experience what is known as ‘cultural shock.' 
	Probably, the liberal philosophical outlook that developed in my mind over 
	past years was a reason. Often on the campus I saw boys and girls in their 
	late teenage or early 20s walk, roam together and kissed each other in

	notice the trend of American culture that unlike back home, when a boy and a

	I wished I met my Roja in USA, instead of India! For the first time I had

	Ibne Warraq, a Muslim apostate and a scholar by any definition; 
	contradictions and ambiguities in Quranic verses written by Syed Kamran 
	Mirza Besides, I found it very interesting to learn about a wide range of 
	freethinkers that swayed Islam and its history. One such freethinker of 
	Muslim origin is poet Al Ma’arri (973-1057), sometimes known as Eastern 
	Lucretius. For Al-Ma'arri, religion is a &quot;<i>fable invented by the ancients</i>,&quot; 
	worthless except for those who exploit the credulous masses. Another well 
	known skeptic of Muslim origin is Omar Khayam, also a great poet and

	Of curse, it didn’t happen overnight. Due to my obsession with internet for

	didn’t act like an opportunist. But at that time it was really hard for me 
	to handle everything with an even head.. Overwhelmed by stress, anger and

	Although profoundly shocked, we were not surprised by the atrocities of

	Reading my testimony, one would see- what I learned from <i>
	Maulana</i> as a child has had a deep impact on my mind in a later life. One 
	might argue- <i>Maulana</i> was an ignorant person and his teaching was 
	erroneous. One might say, real Islam is totally different from what <i>
	Maulana</i> taught me. However, I would certainly disagree with them for by 
	now, I’ve read Quran and <i>Hadeeth</i> myself, and I do think, what <i>
	Maulana</i> taught me significantly exist in Muslims’ Holy Scripture Quran 
	and Hadith as well. I will soon quote verses from Quran to present my stand. 
	Before that, I need to comment on popular views about Islam, or views of 
	what we call ‘mainstream Muslims.' I mentioned in the beginnings that in 
	terms of their views on Islam, my mother, brothers, and sister belong to 
	‘mainstream Muslims.' But who are these ‘mainstream Muslims'? They are the 
	majority of Muslim population, who take words of Quran for granted without 
	ever realizing the need to apply any rationale. They, mistakenly, believe- 
	Islam is all about peace (interestingly, US President George W. Bush also 
	seems to believe so), Muhammad is the greatest human of all times; again, 
	without ever realizing the need to scrutinize his life with a rational and 
	impartial mind. Of course, I agree, unlike Islamic terrorists, mainstream 
	Muslims don’t commit atrocities to others; most of them are peace-loving 
	ordinary people who don't care much about politics. However, they are the 
	people who blame the Islamic terrorists for their actions, but&nbsp;never raise

	my writings, I would like to stimulate minds of educated Muslims throughout 
	the world. I aspire to revive the lost trends of ‘Golden Age of Islam’ (9<sup>th</sup> 
	century to 13<sup>th</sup> century), which was marked by traditions of 
	Muslim rationalists called <i>Mutazillatese.</i> Inspired by the Greek 
	learning, and adhering to rational inquiry, Muslim world flourished 
	remarkably in Astronomy, Medicine, Mathematics, Arts and philosophy. Some 
	great thinkers of golden age are- astronomer <i>Al Sufi, Al Biruni</i> (born 
	in 973), physician <i>Ibne Sina</i> (born in 981), physicist <i>Al-Haytham</i> 
	(born in 965). However, this trend didn’t last. With the change of 
	social-political phenomena, fundamentalism rose and rationalist traditions 
	submerged in the ocean of darkness, from which the Muslim world has yet to 
	emerge. Yet I am very optimistic, since the people who love truth, reason and 
	freedom—however small or big in number—always existed in the human history. 
	There is absolutely no reason to think- they are all gone by now.</font></p>

						particular, have shown themselves capable of barbarous 
						behaviour. Islam is not the only faith to display these 
						very negative traits. After a head start in medical and 
						surgical techniques in India, orthodox Hinduism put an 
						end to surgery because it was considered wrong for the 
						top Brahmin caste to perform surgeries for several 
						reasons. In what was, perhaps, the first case in the 
						world of an advanced civilization becoming little more 
						than a perpetual colony for invaders of every hue, India 
						became an intellectually bankrupt nation for centuries 
						until the revival of modern thought, an Indian 
						Renaissance so to say, when the British finally came in 
						to the region and took it over using some of the most 
						devious means that any of India's conquerors had 
						employed. Sadly, the South Asian region these days is 
						becoming another morass with competing religious groups 
						fighting over religious pettiness instead of using the 
						very real human and intellectual capital in the region 
						to catapult it into the top civilization in the world 
						once more after some&nbsp;1000 plus years of lagging behind 
						the rest of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div>

	Hello Jahed,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I had read your other article in the morning and commented on 
	that and had bookmarked this one to read at leisure (as it was lengthy).<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Am speechless. Dont know what to say or write. Never have I 
	read such an honest essay about one's life and beliefs. Yes your Roja and 
	you would have definitely been united had you been in the U.S. About the 
	concepts of Islam, whatever I have read in your blog has left me disgusted (<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">not</span> 
	your writing but the truth about the religion)...what with the prayers of 
	burning in hell for Hindus and world split into Muslim regions and war 
	regions. GROSS! <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Keep writing! You write with passion and sincerity and it 
	shows. Good luck with your endeavours. </font></font><br>

													It needs real courage to 
													analyze ones past--but you 
													did it. yours is really&nbsp;a 
													passionate and honest blogs. 
													Reading that one thing was 
													clear. you are a thinker and 
													thinkers can afford to frame 
													their religion. --In your 
													case it is humanism. But not 
													every ordinary soul afford 
													to reach that level. They 
													like to belong to a group 
													and feel&nbsp; superior against 
													another-- to have an 
													identity. They also seek 
													spiritual protection. 
													Religion&nbsp; had survived 
													through centuries because of 
													this inner yearning. I 
													salute an atheist but cannot 
													be one. I too seek that 
													invisible protection 
													whenever&nbsp;&nbsp; feel emotionally 
													threatened. So I think 
													&nbsp;religion will stay, as long 
													as&nbsp; people like us live. But 
													there is a need to 
													depoliticize&nbsp; it. 
													Unfortunately Islam has 
													become a weapon in hand of 
													male chauvinist Mullahs and 
													Dictators.There is a need to 
													work from within,&nbsp; &nbsp;rather 
													than leaving the religion&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													and attacking it 
													blatantly---&nbsp;thereby 
													alienating the masses. &quot;We 
													wrote articles on a regular 
													basis. It was interesting to 
													see how crazily Mullah 
													reacted to our sharp 
													criticisms of Islam. Often 
													we received hate mails from 
													Mullahs.&quot; Yes, mullahs react 
													and that gives writers a 
													&nbsp;high. But they are people 
													beyond repair. It is more 
													important is to stay with 
													community and change from 
													inside. The way Iswar 
													Chandra vidyasagar fought 
													Sati from inside.&nbsp; the Hindu 
													society&nbsp; by intelligent use 
													of&nbsp; religious scripts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
													real change comes only 
													through that.<br>

	The first thing I read was your autobiographical essay, &quot;My Experience With 
	Islam (An apostate’s testimony)&quot;. It was <i>truly</i> <b><u>inspiring</u></b>. 
	People like you renew my faith in humanity.
	<img alt="" src="English/i_smile.gif" border="0" width="15" height="15">
	I've bookmarked your articles page. I'm sure they're all as stimulating as 
	the first one. <b>@ everyone reading this:</b>I <b>**<u>highly recommend</u>**</b> 
	you read this article:<br>
	Awesome piece of writing, Jahed. It gave me an unprecedented look at the 
	muslim theist psyche. Thank you very much.&nbsp; </font>

	<a href="http://www.thefreethinker.tk/">http://www.thefreethinker.tk/</a>:</b><br>
	Congrats Jahed Ahmed for this wonderful article. Believers of institutional 
	religion often portrays rationalists and humanists as negative character , 
	someone who lack moral and ethical value. Jahed Ahmed with his sound 
	intellect tells us how a rationalist humanist will have a strong sense of 
	ethics and moral values.<br>
	He didn't became a non believer of institutional religion overnight. It was 
	a long process of research and quest for the truth and that attracted me the 
	most in this article. Rationalist unlike the believer of institutional 
	religion are never fanatic. Rationalist are benevolent enough to accept the 
	truth. They always believes in scientific proof and logical reasoning. 
	Rationalist always accept or discard something only after careful research 
	and questioning. Hats off to Jahed Ahmed like a true rationalist he had a 
	quest for the truth and only then he became a disbeliever of institutional 
	religion.<br>
	Jahed Ahmed , about the article something is obscure to me. You told us how 
	you fall in love with a girl in Bangalore 'Roja' a name given by you. It was 
	'love at first sight' . Don't you think love is a relation made up by 
	friendship, trust and mutual respect? And to have that there should 
	ideological match...and for the most important requirement is to know the 
	person. <br>
	Wish to know your stand on that..</font><span id="Ymsgr2"></span><style type="text/css">.replbq{width:100%}</style><font face="Arial" size="1"><SCRIPT type=text/javascript>
