<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">JUSTIN AKERS CHACON, 
coauthor with Mike Davis of the upcoming book <i>No One Is Illegal,</i> 
discusses the crucial issue missing from the mainstream political debate on 
immigration--amnesty for undocumented workers.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
- - -</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">A SPECTER is haunting 
Congress--the specter of amnesty. As millions of immigrant workers and students 
strike, walk out and protest against anti-immigrant legislation being discussed 
in Congress, the debate over amnesty is beginning. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Taking place primarily as a 
fight within the Republican Party, amnesty is becoming the subtext for a 
polarization in the politics of immigration. Only no one in Washington is 
supporting it. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">On one side are the 
“enforcement” Republicans, critical of any guest-worker proposals since they 
contain language about a “pathway to citizenship.” Appealing to their 
conservative base to halt the march of immigrant rights, the “enforcement” 
Republicans pander to fears, insecurities and outright racism.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">As Senate Majority Leader Bill 
Frist (R-Tenn.) complained, “I disagree with [guest-worker proposals] not just 
as a matter of principle, but because granting amnesty now will only encourage 
future and further disrespect for the law. It will undermine our efforts to 
secure our homeland.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Anyone who supports such 
proposals, said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), should be “branded with a scarlet 
letter A,” for “amnesty.” </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">According to Rep. Tom Tancredo 
(R-Colo.), a darling of the hard-line right-wing anti-immigrant organizations 
who launched his congressional career in 1998 on a platform of opposition to 
amnesty, immigrants are “a scourge that threatens the very future of our 
nation.” Tancredo followed his latest tirade with a “Just Say No to Amnesty 
Week” campaign, urging supporters to turn the screws on Republican senators who 
are “selling out America” by supporting more moderate immigration legislation 
that includes plans for a guest-worker program.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">On another side of the debate 
are the “guest-worker” Republicans and Democrats, eager to secure cheap labor 
for big business. They are determined to prove that the guest-worker proposals 
are <i>not </i>an amnesty, but rather a means to prevent one. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Referring to his own 
guest-worker proposal, Arizona Sen. John McCain explained that it focused on 
enforcement. In a statement on the Web site of Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), who 
cosponsored the bill McCain supports, McCain stated, “Homeland security is our 
nation’s number one priority. This legislation includes a number of provisions 
that together will make our nation more secure. For far too long, our nation’s 
broken immigration laws have gone unreformed--leaving Americans vulnerable. We 
can no longer afford to delay reform. I am proud to join my colleagues today as 
an original sponsor of this legislation.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who 
has entered the picture as a broker trying to reconcile the “enforcement” and 
“guest-worker” wings in Congress, has also come out firmly against amnesty. 
Promoting a recent compromise proposal that increases border militarization and 
includes a guest-worker proposal, Specter declared, “It is not an amnesty.” In 
an amnesty, he told the <i>Los Angeles Times, </i>“lawbreakers do not have to 
pay for their transgressions.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Kennedy likewise assured his 
colleagues, “There is no free ticket...This is not amnesty.” </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">There is a third side to the 
debate, and though it isn’t recognized as an “official” voice, it is now 
shifting the terms of the debate. That side is the U.S. working class, led by 
millions of immigrant workers, their children and their supporters. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The past weeks of mass protests 
and student walkouts have shaken the country. This new civil rights movement has 
shifted the debate about immigration out of the executive boardrooms, golf clubs 
and annual stockholder meetings, and forced it into the open.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The movement is putting 
pressure on Congress to come up with a “plan B” to the Sensenbrenner Bill passed 
last December by the House, which embodies the program of the “enforcement” 
Republicans.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Republican House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert summed up the new common ground. “Our first priority is to protect the 
border,” Hastert said. “And we also know there is a need in some sectors of the 
economy for a guest-worker program. But we want to see what the Senate comes 
forward with, and we will go through the process.”</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">THERE ARE two reasons why a 
guest-worker program is emerging as the bipartisan consensus in Washington.
</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Guest-worker programs, by their 
very nature, create a second class of workers in the U.S. Current proposals 
would allow workers to remain in the country for a limited duration, after which 
they must leave or compete for a scarce number of visas. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">While in this country, guest 
workers don’t have the rights afforded to other workers. They aren’t allowed to 
collectively bargain, join unions or speak out against exploitative bosses, and 
can only leave an oppressive job if they have another already lined up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">This is why Cesar Chavez and 
the United Farm Workers could only build the historic farmworker struggle after 
winning the abolition of the last guest-worker program, known as the bracero 
program, in 1964. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Under the bracero program, 
growers were able to turn agriculture into a $40 billion-a-year industry by 
keeping out unions and setting a standard for low wages. The legacy, according 
to a study by the <i>Sacramento Bee</i>, is that the many poor farmworkers make 
no more that $4,000 a year today.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">As labor journalist David Bacon 
concluded, guest-worker “proposals incorporate demands by the Essential Worker 
Immigration Coalition--36 of the U.S.’s largest trade and manufacturers’ 
associations, headed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce...Despite their claims, 
there is no great shortage of workers in the U.S. There is a shortage of workers 
at the low wages industry would like to pay.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The guest-worker proposals are 
designed to prevent or reduce unionism in industries beyond agriculture. Current 
proposals, embraced by a host of corporate interests, would allow guest workers 
to be used in construction, meatpacking, hotels and restaurants, manufacturing, 
transportation, health care and other sectors of the economy. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">It is within these very 
industries that immigrant workers have played a key role revitalizing the union 
movement in the last two decades. While union membership has been declining over 
the last three decades, immigrant workers are a growth engine. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">According to a study of the 
Migrant Policy Institute, 11 percent of the 17.7 million foreign-born workers in 
the U.S. are represented by unions, despite the difficulties associated with 
citizenship. Reflecting changing attitudes in the unions and militancy among 
immigrant workers themselves, the number of immigrants in unions has grown 23 
percent between 1996 and 2003. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The Service Employees 
Industrial Union (SEIU), with members primarily in property services, health 
care and the public sector, has become the largest and fastest growing union in 
the U.S., claiming a membership of 1.8 million. Immigrant workers account for 
some two-thirds of that figure.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">A new guest-worker program 
would halt union growth in those sectors and trigger a gradual erosion as 
braceros could be used as leverage against union drives and contract 
negotiations. A new guest-worker program would create a vast segregated 
workforce, controlled and exploited by big business--and set the workers’ 
movement back to the days before Cesar Chavez and the farmworkers’ movement.
</font></p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="1">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">AN AMNESTY is a provision that 
allows for the immediate legalization of the undocumented, with a guaranteed 
means of attaining citizenship for those who want it. Unlike current proposals, 
which use the deceptive language of “earned” citizenship or a “path to” 
citizenship and which exclude the majority from obtaining permanent residency, 
amnesty would make immigrants equals with the rest of the working class. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The last amnesty, passed in 
1986, led to legalization and citizenship for about 2.8 million immigrant 
workers. This set the stage for a new generation of organizing drives that fed 
unions like the SEIU, UNITE-HERE and others. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">While other unions were pushed 
on the defensive, immigrant worker-led union drives demonstrated a willingness 
to fight. This led the AFL-CIO to support the organizing of immigrants, 
including the undocumented, and led to a growing demand amongst workers 
themselves for a new amnesty. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">This is the demand now 
emanating from the streets, and it is sending chills down the spine of Corporate 
America. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">If the 11 million undocumented 
workers in the U.S. today were given equal rights, it would abolish the legal 
segregation that serves as the means to exploit the powerless. It would also 
undermine the racism that justifies the militarization of the border. It would 
give a voice to the voiceless and increase the number of voters who could have 
recourse against politicians trying to build their careers by scapegoating 
immigrants. It would also help revitalize a labor movement in crisis. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">As the new immigrant rights 
movement awakens, it must put forth its own proposal: Amnesty without 
criminalization. As Maria Gonzalez, a marcher at the demonstration of 1 million 
in Los Angeles March 25, commented as she considered the masses of workers 
around her, “With this many people, we should demand legalization and amnesty.”</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">While Congress is being forced 
to respond to the demands of the protests, it is only as a means to defend 
corporate interests, reshuffle their cards and head off a new civil rights 
movement. Only when the politicians are forced to concede to the organized power 
of a united movement will they reluctantly accept our demands. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">That is why we must continue to 
build the immigrant rights movement, independent of the bipartisan legislative 
proposals that serve Corporate America. We have to organize where we have the 
most power: in the workplaces, schools and communities.<br>
