	continues with one Maolana, Rashid Ghazi, and his followers holding perhaps 
	as many as 850 children as a human shield to prevent what they claim is an 
	imminent attack by the Pakistani paramilitary forces. Though the

	Tribune is reporting that as many as 27 girls may have been killed inside 
	the masjid as this piece is written, the exemplary restraint shown by the 
	Pakistani forces needs to be lauded. They did not succumb to the temptation 
	of going in with guns blazing and actually offered amnesty to all of the 
	Maolana's followers who did not have criminal cases against them. The 
	government also offered Rs 5000 to every surrendering student inside so that 
	they could leave to join their families. And, how did the two leaders 
	responsible for this crisis respond? They got their students to swear to 
	accept martyrdom at first and then the elder Maolana, Abdul Aziz, tried to 
	sneak out by hiding in a batch of girl students wearing a burqa. He even 
	gave an interview to several TV channels while wearing the same burqa 
	without any shame for his act. And his brother holds hundreds of children 
	hostage.</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333"><font size="2">Until this 
	crisis reached boiling point, these men were busy igniting the minds of 
	Muslim youths (boys and girls) with hatred, espousing violence through the 
	temptation of heaven in the afterlife, and yet, it is now clear, they didn’t 
	believe a trace of it themselves. Or, if they did, why did the elder Maolana 
	try to escape? Going by his own logic, one could argue, with his attempted 
	escape, (he was caught at the end) Maolana Aziz lost a golden opportunity to 
	reach heaven and enjoy an endless number of privileges including the company 
	of virgin women as a reward for martyrdom. Sadly, while he peddled this 
	fraudulent vision through violence, murder and mayhem, some believed the 
	Maolana and killed and perished when the Pakistani paramilitary forces 
	returned fire when they were first attacked.</font></span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333"><font size="2">“They only 
	want martyrdom, they don’t want to go home,” said a girl student named 
	Maryam Qayeeum while leaving mosque before the fighting began.</font></span></b><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333"><font size="2"> 
	This tells how the temptation of heaven was dangled as a bait to instigate 
	impressionable young minds toward violence and killing. And the stupidity 
	extended to some adults as well. <b>A father of two girl students described 
	his daughters attending a madrassa attached to the mosque saying, “They are 
	14 and 10 years old. I have talked to them and they are willing to die for 
	Islam.&quot;</b> A sane and normal father would have wanted to see his daughters 
	grow up to be model people – doctors, engineers, teachers, bank officers or 
	one of many thousands of other professions where they could contribute to 
	society and make everyone proud. What kind of father would want to see his 
	own 10 and 14 year old girls dead? And this is what the Maolanas tried to 
	achieve with their preaching. They were happy to see ignorant people fall 
	for lies of heaven and even offer their own children for martyrdom.</font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333"><font size="2">Through all 
	of this, a pattern is clear. <b>Whether it is a Maolana Abdul Aziz or an
	<span style="cursor: hand" id="lw_1183700186_2">
	<span style="cursor: hand" id="lw_1183785291_2">Osama Bin Laden</span></span>, 
	no preacher of hatred wants to see his own family suffer or to find 
	martyrdom himself. </b>The Maolana extracted a promise of martyrdom from 
	hundreds of young people and then conveniently tried escaping with a woman's 
	and by hiding among young girls. Bin Laden sent dozens of young men to their 
	doom on 9/11 and promptly went into hiding when the US sent a powerful army 
	into <span style="cursor: hand" id="lw_1183785291_3">
	<span style="cursor: hand" id="lw_1183700186_3">Afghanistan</span></span> to 
	get him. Who knows? Maybe he too wore a burqa and a wig on his head as he 
	ran leaving hundreds of brainwashed people to die. </font></span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt">
	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333"><font size="2">Humanists, 
	both religious and secular, have agonized and tried to understand this 
	vulnerability in some people who happily cede common sense in return for 
	promises of a fictitious salvation. While there may be no single reason that 
	is common to every case of religious brainwashing by people like the Maolana, 
	the fortunate fact is that those who would be swayed by this kind of thought 
	are a minority. About a month ago, almost a million people marched in the 
	streets of <span style="cursor: hand" id="lw_1183785291_4">
	<span style="cursor: hand" id="lw_1183700186_4">Pakistan</span></span> to 
	protest against the Maolana's edicts and demanded that the government take 
	action against these lunatics. These were ordinary, religious people, who 
	could not stomach the nonsense that the Maloanas were bandying about. In the 
	end, Maolana Abdul Aziz, as the senior cleric, did a far better job of 
	discrediting himself than any protestors against him or government forces 
	could have done. By turning himself into a national joke, hopefully, he has 
	opened the eyes of those who wanted to die listening to his lies. Hopefully, 
	the mind of the man who wanted to see his two little girls martyred is also 
	open to the reality of what this hate monger represented. <br>
