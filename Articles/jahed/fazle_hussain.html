	<font face="Verdana" size="2">“It’s not size but vitality that really 
	matters,” said Professor Shankar Bhatt of the Microbiology department at Mysore 
	University while gazing at me affectionately. I was a newly admitted student 
	in the Master’s degree program in the Microbiology department and trying to shift to 
	the Biotechnology department at that time since I had also applied there and 
	qualified for admission. Prof. Bhatt was especially kind to me from the beginning and 
	often he would advise me on issues pertaining to higher education. “Have you 
	ever 
	seen the trunk of a tree floating with the current of river?” </font>

	<span style="background: #FFFFFF">he asked me</span><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">.</span></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">
	</span>“Yes,” I answered. “Now,” he continued, 
	“compare this with the swimming of a tiny fish in the same river stream 
	against the current and you get whole picture.” “The big sized tree trunk 
	cannot go against the current but the tiny fish can, because it is gifted 
	with the vitality of life,” the professor stopped, giving me time to reflect 
	on. </font><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana">That 
	conversation happened nearly ten years ago. I left India in 1998 and was not 
	in touch with Bhatt since then. But lately I have been reminded of Prof. 
	Shankar Bhatt and his wonderful remarks while going through the life story 
	of another professor—the internationally reputed Bangladeshi-American 
	scientist--Prof. Fazle Hussain.</span></font></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the 
	implementation of Fazle Hussain’s research? <i>A lot</i>- would be the honest 
	answer in common words. &nbsp;Hussain did not have doubts that behind the 
	“seemingly random motion of turbulence, there is an organization” which if 
	explored, could be exploited to our advantage. It has been proven over time 
	that Hussain was right about his hypothesis. Using the strategy of 
	controlling turbulence flow developed by Hussain, it is possible to design 
	jet and aircraft engines/turbines which are not only fuel efficient and 
	better, but also able to reduce “aircraft friction drag up to 20 percent,” 
	thus reducing “expenditures on aircraft fuel by $ 3 billion per year.”*<sup>5</sup> 
	In this kind of development, Hussain’s associate was his Ph.D. student Wade 
	Schoppa. Hussain’s other collaborative project (with Michael Goldshtik, 
	Ph.D.) involves the development of a ‘bladeless helicopter powered by 
	“manufactured tornado” and is capable of vertical ascent and landing.’ *</font><sup><font size="2">6

	real person. Of a handful of Bangladeshi newspapers that wrote about Prof. Hussain, a significant 
	one is the Dhaka based<i> Executive Times</i> (ET), which in its December 2003 issue

	inspiring stories of Hussain’s life:</span><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Fazle 
	Hussain was not born with <i>a silver spoon in his mouth.</i> In his own words<sup>*8</sup>, 
	“Born in the middle of nine children, supported by the meager income of my 
	father who worked as a rice research assistant in the government agriculture 
	laboratory, I grew up in poverty…….. I was taking care of our cows (source 
	of milk for the family) and growing vegetables in the spacious yards around 
	the house (watering them by lifting water from wells and carrying water&nbsp; to 
	the plots were very demanding); both were staples for the&nbsp; family. These 
	chores would take quite a few hours a day, often in the dark at night.” And 
	there is more to the story. He had only “the 
	cheapest school” available to him. His dream in high school days 
	was to become a technician. He was not recruited into Pakistani Army for 
	being “short.” A shy boy in his childhood, Hussain “had no skill in 
	speaking, let alone in English.” At a farewell ceremony for the high school’s 
	retiring headmaster, Hussain was chosen to give a speech but he failed to 
	deliver a single word on the dais. The incident was very embarrassing for 
	him as he recalls later, “with tears rolling down my cheeks, I came down 
	from the dais, feeling totally humiliated and shattered by letting the 
	students down. …I could not forgive myself. I vowed to overcome stage fright 
	and never allow myself to be embarrassed like that.“<sup>*9</sup> What really 
	distinguishes Fazle Hussain from others is his firm resolve to change 
	himself. He was not there to give up. Indeed, he has proved himself to be 
	true to the words of his resolve. In his own account: ”<span style="color: black">the 
	shy boy was shy no more. I became the Editor of the BUET’s Students’ Central 
	Union in my 2nd Year(1961), General Secretary in the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
	Year(1962) and Vice-President in the 4<sup>th</sup> Year(1963)(VC was the 
	President).” At the same time, the boy who once was not able to speak a 
	single word of English also served as a </span>“varsity correspondent (for 
	the years 1960-63) of the Pakistan Observer”, Mizanur Rahman Shelly (the 
	former chief of the interim government in Bangladesh) “was the other 
	correspondent.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just 
	ten days prior to his Matriculation (now SSC) exam, Fazle lost all his notes 
	and other study materials when seemingly a targeted burglary took place in 
	his house. That, however, didn’t stop him from taking exam and coming out 
	with flying colors. He was ranked first in Matric (Tech) and third in I.Sc. 
	final&nbsp; when he had to take exam from the bed due to severe sickness. And 
	that gave him the message he needed so badly. “I gained some confidence that 
	I had probably genuine merit. I actually never felt that I was more capable 
	than others,” he later recalls the events that made him a self-starter. He 
	did not have to look back thereafter. As a student leader at EPUET (East 
	Pakistan University of Engineering &amp; Technology, later named BUET), he set 
	examples that could be model for students even today. He fought for 
	students’ rights while putting personal interests at stake, confronted 
	authority much higher and senior, yet he was passionately against party any 
	politics on campus and espoused that “students should not be pawns of 
	politicians.” During his student leadership, he successfully resisted 
	mainstream politics “from entering the campus” of the EPUET. </font></span>
