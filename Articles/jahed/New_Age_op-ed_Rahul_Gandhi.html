							<p align="justify">Lately an important piece of news 
							has gone unnoticed by most&nbsp;of the mainstream news 
							media of Bangladesh. In a recent political campaign, 
							Rahul Gandhi, a member of the Indian parliament and 
							son of a former Indian prime minister, the late 
							Rajiv Gandhi, has solely credited&nbsp;his family for the 
							division of Pakistan in 1971, which led to the 
							independence of Bangladesh. While campaigning for a 
							candidate in the state of Uttar Pradesh, considered 
							India’s heartland, Mr Gandhi managed to say, ‘Once 
							my family decides on something, it doesn’t go back. 
							Whether it’s about India’s freedom, dividing 
							Pakistan or taking India to the 21st century.’ The 
							remark clearly implied that it was a family vendetta 
							against Pakistan that drove the division of the 
							erstwhile East Pakistan and led to the creation of 
							Bangladesh. It ignored the systematic genocide of 
							three million Bengalis by the Pakistani army, the 
							rape and humiliation of hundreds of thousands of 
							Bengali women and the cascade of events preceding 
							1971 such as the language movement of 1952, 
							six-point based agitation of 1966 and the Bengali 
							people’s revolt in 1969 against Ayub Khan.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the incident did not merit any attention 
							within Bangladesh for reasons that are completely 
							unknown, condemnation both within India and from 
							Pakistan was immediate and vociferous. The only 
							public protest&nbsp;from a Bangladeshi voice was that of 
							the exiled author Dr Taslima Nasrin who spoke at a 
							press conference in Bhopal and listed the 1952 
							killings of Bangladeshis for asking that Bangla be 
							made&nbsp;a state language and of the mass movement that 
							began against the country’s Pakistani rulers in 
							1969. While she did not condemn the casual 
							callousness with which these remarks were issued, 
							she could not, because she is a resident of India 
							and hopes to get Indian citizenship someday, it was 
							clear that she did not approve of the cynical 
							attempt by Mr Gandhi to suggest that the sacrifices 
							of the Bangladeshi people did not mean anything, 
							that it was his grandmother’s anti-Pakistan vendetta 
							that actually split the country up.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the exiled Pakistani doctor and 
							humanist, Dr M Younus Sheikh, who lives in 
							Switzerland, released an open letter to members of 
							the Indian parliament, condemning the ‘foolish and 
							immature’ remarks that Mr Gandhi had issued. Dr 
							Sheikh has authored articles on the repression in 
							Bangladesh under Pakistani rule, was one of the 
							first Pakistanis to protest what he clearly called 
							‘genocide’ against Bengalis by the Pakistani army, 
							and for this as well as several other reasons he was 
							jailed and sentenced to death under completely 
							trumped up charges in Pakistan until international 
							pressure forced the government to release him from 
							prison and exile him to Switzerland where he lives 
							today.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously, the response from Dhaka has been 
							muted, to say the least. The Bangladesh high 
							commissioner to India would only remark that he was 
							grateful to India for its support in the struggle 
							for independence and there was no statement at all 
							from Dhaka until the writing of this article. 
							Indeed, in comparison to the angry voices both 
							within India as well as from Pakistan (albeit for 
							completely different reasons, because the Pakistani 
							government now claims that it now has evidence that 
							the whole struggle in Bangladesh was merely an 
							Indian inspired secessionist plot) the silence from 
							Dhaka has been deafening. Few countries are as proud 
							of their language and, therefore, of their struggle 
							to form a nation based on the suppression of their 
							language as Bangladesh, and yet, the attempt by Mr 
							Gandhi to suggest that the 
							now&nbsp;well-documented&nbsp;horrors of the struggle for 
							independence were little more than a task that his 
							grandmother had decided to take up to gain personal 
							revenge against Pakistan did not receive a single 
							note of protest in response.<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>One must not mix up the issue of acknowledging 
							India’s generous role and humanitarian effort during 
							1971 by Bangladesh with the condemnation of Rahul 
							Gandhi’s infantile remarks. While Bangladesh, as a 
							nation, does not have any valid reasons to forget 
							India’s help during our liberation struggle in 1971; 
							welcoming Rahul Gandhi’s comments by the Bangladesh 
							government — as it was reported in some Indian 
							newspapers — would not only be just self-degrading, 
							it will also be a dishonour to the memory of three 
							million martyrs of 1971.</b><br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, it is because of the current political 
							situation within Bangladesh that this silence 
							continues, more than two days after the remarks 
							attracted the flak that they did in the rest of 
							South Asia. Perhaps, at a time when relations 
							between the three major nations of South Asia have 
							been visibly improving, no one in Dhaka would like 
							to rock the boat. The fact, though, is that neither 
							the spokespeople in Pakistan nor the segment of the 
							Indian political and media establishment that 
							criticised these remarks believes that criticizing 
							Rahul Gandhi’s ridiculous claims is likely to set 
							the process of rapprochement back. Criticising a 
							callous statement that demeans the struggle of an 
							entire nation and its people to emerge from severe 
							political repression and hardship to enjoy their 
							independence as a people does not amount to a 
							declaration of war. It is unfortunate that no voice 
							has been raised in Dhaka about these remarks yet. 
							The silence speaks as poorly about those who choose 
							not to speak about the remarks as it does about 
							Rahul Gandhi’s personal callousness. </span></a>
