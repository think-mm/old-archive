	<b>For a better Bangladesh: eminent&nbsp; leaders visit&nbsp; New York&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	By <a href="index.html">Jahed Ahmed</a><br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	<i>Will the situation in Bangladesh change very soon? Well, I don’t know. 
	But it’s a healthy sign to see country’s secular and&nbsp; progressive forces 
	getting united.<br>
	</i>&nbsp;<br>
	<font face="Verdana"><b>SAN-Feature Service :</b> With the national election 
	scheduled to take place in next few months, the latest visit of some of the 
	prominent opposition leaders of the 14 party political alliances&nbsp; from 
	Bangladesh to New York was quite significant. <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	A notable number of expatriate Bangladeshis had gathered to hear what 
	alternatives if any, the leaders of the opposition parties had to offer. 
	Those who flew to the USA from Bangladesh and spoke in several gatherings&nbsp; 
	of expatriate Bangladeshis were Dr. Kamal Hussain, the eminent lawyer and 
	the main architect of the&nbsp; country’s&nbsp; 1972&nbsp; secular constitution, Ajoy Roy, 
	a senior leftist leader; Suranjit Sen Gupta, former parliamentary adviser to 
	the prime minister during previous government;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abdul Matin Khoshru, former 
	law minister of the Awami legue&nbsp; government ;&nbsp; Rashed Khan Menon, President 
	of Bangladesh Workers’ Party, and Dr. Reza Kibria, a professor from 
	Australia, who also happens to be the only son of late Shah ASM Kibria­the 
	assassinated leader of Awami league and&nbsp; former finance minister.<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	“I’ve gained enough in my life, held several important positions at home 
	and&nbsp; abroad. I don’t have any personal ambition. And same holds true for 
	those who’re sitting next to me,” Dr. Kamal Hussain said, pointing his 
	fingers at Mr. Ajoy Roy--a senior&nbsp; leader with affiliation to progressive 
	politics, and Dr. Reza Kibria who--leaving behind a well paid and&nbsp; secure 
	life in Australia--is now spending time in Bangladesh to raise people’s 
	voice against violence, corruption and injustice where he and&nbsp; his family 
	have significantly succeeded to gain supports from commoners both with and 
	without any political affiliations. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"> <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Nevertheless, the audience, just like their counterparts back home, was 
	cautious and some were skeptical too. Having eye witnessed so many hollow 
	and&nbsp; broken promises of the political parties in the past, Bangladeshi 
	people now don’t seem to get moved easily with just sweet political speech. 
	This was reflected during the meetings . <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Questions asked by the audience ranged from mild to a serious one. “Why 
	couldn’t Awami league bring ’71 war criminals to justice?” “Why didn’t Awami 
	league grant autonomy to the judiciary system?” “Would you guys ban 
	political use of religion if you gain power?” <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	One of the questions to which neither former AL law minister&nbsp; Abdul Matin 
	Khosru, nor Dr. Kamal Hussain could come up with a satisfactory answer was 
	one asked by Mr. Pradip Das of New York. “Why didn’t Awami league repealed&nbsp; 
	the infamous ‘enemy property act’?”&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Having not been a part of the previous AL-led government, Dr. Kamal Hussain, 
	nevertheless, was in a safer position. Dr.&nbsp; Hussain and other leaders 
	probably sensed it that gone are the days to lure voters with hollow 
	promises. Time has come for the leaders to set their records straight.&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Amid big applaud and&nbsp; cheers, Dr. Hussain at one point announced, “with Mr. 
	Khosru (former law minister of AL) sitting beside me, I’d like to make it 
	clear, if we come to power, in the first session of the parliament we’d pass 
	the law to separate judiciary system from the executive branch granting it a 
	total autonomy.” <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Dr. Kamal Hussain seemed especially focused and&nbsp; optimistic. “We’ve included 
	it in our 23 points of agreement&nbsp; that in order to ensure that our 
	government would be a government of the people, we must nominate only those 
	candidates who are honest and qualified; and not any of those with any kind 
	of affiliation with black money or corruption.” <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	“The basis of our alliance is that we all aspire for a secular, progressive 
	and&nbsp; democratic Bangladesh,” said Kamal Hussain. He told the audience that 
	he’d said the same in his meetings with Sheikh Hasina, the Awami league 
	Chief and former Bangladesh&nbsp; Prime Minister. “Sheikh Hasina truly 
	understands &amp; seems to be very sincere about the legitimacy of our 
	demands.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	I’ve heard of Dr. Reza Kibria’s name but didn’t see him in person until the 
	meeting in New York. Nor do I think, many of the attendees heard of him a 
	lot. When he stood up to speak before the audience, his identity to me was 
	mostly the son of late Shah ASM Kibria. My perspective, however, changed 
	after I listened to his speech. And the reason behind is not that he’s 
	remarkably a handsome man, probably in his mid 40s, but his eloquent yet 
	soft spoken speech was different than what most politicians love to talk of.
	<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Reza Kibria narrated his experience with his late father, his father’s 
	dreams and how the unfortunate assassination of his father led him into a 
	movement that he never anticipated before. “Do you have any regrets for 
	getting involved into political issues?” I asked him. “No.” he said. “But 
	it’s not easy. They are organized and we’re not.” <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Needless to say, here ‘they’ denote to the radical and&nbsp; fundamentalist 
	forces who abhor the concepts of democracy, secular state &amp; equality. &quot;It's 
	not the protest of a heinous crime such as the murder of my father that 
	destroys country's image. It's the crime itself that is putting our 
	country's image at stake,&quot; Kibria said alluding to the allegations made by 
	the BNP-Jamaat gang against the secular forces that they're ruining 
	country's image in abroad. As for the trial of his father’s murder, he 
	said,” we want a fair &amp; just trial; not one done in a haste just to serve a 
	political goal.” <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	During my personal conversation with him, Reza Kibria’s advice to me (he’s a 
	well wisher &amp; occasionally a contributor of Mukto-Mona) was “pick your 
	battle carefully. Only one at a time.” My reply was “somewhere someone has 
	to take the initiative.” <br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Although I attended twice, I couldn’t listen to all the speakers. In fact, I 
	missed, Rashed Khan Menon and&nbsp; Ajoy Roy.&nbsp; Suranjit Sen Gupta didn’t show up 
	in Jackson Heights gathering despite he’s announced the chief guest .&nbsp; 
	However, outside the auditorium, I spoke to Ajoy Roy . <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
	Will the situation in Bangladesh change very soon? Well, I don’t know. But 
	it’s a healthy sign to see country’s secular and&nbsp; progressive forces getting 
	united. Such unity, however, would be meaningful for our future only if it 
	is based on a commitment toward democracy, liberty and&nbsp; justice, and not on 
	just a greed for the power.&nbsp; A unity without commitments is unlikely to 
	bring about the change people of Bangladesh have been aspiring for so 
	eagerly</font><i><b><font face="Verdana">.</font>---SAN-Feature Service /
