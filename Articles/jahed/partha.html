  <p align="center"><font color="#800000" size="5" face="Arial Narrow">A Dr. Partha Banerjee and
  his Missions!</font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">By <a href="index.html">Jahed Ahmed&nbsp;</a></font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">About two years ago- I suppose- it happened. I saved a paper cutting from a
  New York based Bangla weekly (&quot;<i>Ekhoni Somoy</i>&quot;) thinking- I'd
  scan and e-mail the article to Mukto-Mona moderator Avijit Roy since the style
  and essence of the article impressed me so much. At that time, I didn't have <i>bornosoft</i>.
  So typing the original article in Bangla was not possible. The very article
  dealt with communal riot and its root. The writer's picture appeared in small
  size at the center of the article. A beaming and smiling face as if, it was
  glowing. Lately- in a discussion on Dr. Ali Riaz's recently released book
  entitled &quot;God Willing: The Politics of Islamism in Bangladesh.&quot; I
  was invited as a listener. Among four keynote speakers one figure seemed to be
  familiar. That same trimmed beard, same smiling face, but a bit aged now
  although complexion seemed fairer than I saw on paper. Moderator's
  announcement of speakers' names removed doubt from my mind. He is Mr. Partha
  Banerjee- the author of the article I mentioned. Still I remember the content
  of the article that intrigued me quite profoundly; in a nutshell- it was:
  politicians create communal tensions and riots for their own advantage. It's a
  game of interest; not an interesting game in itself. <b>Citing example of
  Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, Partha Banerjee showed- hardly, if ever,
  communal riots have done damages to elite minorities. Mostly victims are poor
  class in both communities: poor Muslims of India and poor Hindus of
  Bangladesh; but not always rich Muslims of India and rich Hindus of Bangladesh</b>.</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family:Arial Narrow">
  <img width="98" height="104" src="partha1.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1025"></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Arial Narrow"><o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial Narrow"><br>
	Dr.Partha
  Banerjee<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Wow! What a brilliant analysis! I said to myself. Mukto-Mona readers must
  not be deprived of it. I beg apology to readers for I couldn't finally send
  the article to Mukto-Mona. Few days ago, Shahriar Kabir, a secular and
  internationally well-known journalist/author from Bangladesh came over New
  York. During a chat with drama-director and actor Syed Hasan Imam and others,
  he was enquiring about Partha Banerjee. It took me a while to understand why
  Partha Banerjee is such a popular face among NY-based Bengali community. Now I
  understand why and very well so. <br>
	Partha Banerjee, although holds a Ph.D. from Cornell in Journalism and Mass
  Communication is top-to-bottom a human rights activist. He is the new
  executive director of Immigration Policy Network based in Newark, NJ, which
  deals with issues that South Asian Immigrants face in their daily lives: hate
  crimes, discriminations at work place and beyond.<br>
	By virtue of attending that book discussion, I had a privilege to come
  closer to Dr. Banerjee. We exchanged e mail IDs. First- I e mailed him and it
  was reciprocated by a prompt reply.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">His latest e mail to me reads, amongst, other things:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow" size="2">&quot;…….If there's any way you can organize my
    talk on human and immigrant rights, war, secularism, terrorism, etc. (i.e.,
    the subjects of my writing and work), I think people in New York and New
    Jersey would be highly benefited. Let me know if that's possible. I can be
    available on weekends.<br>
	Keep up the good work at Mukto Mona. ……….People
    need to know what off-mainstream work can be for us immigrants and how
    important and rewarding it is.<br>
	Shubhecchha roilo.<br>
	Partha da &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Partha Banerjee has been a vocal voice against human rights violations of
  religious minorities in India, his country of origin. His counterpart in
  Bangladesh, in my opinion, is Mr. Shahriar Kabir, who was imprisoned by
  current four party alliance government for having reported tortures and
  indiscriminate harassments of Hindu, other minorities and opposition activists
  to international community followed by October 2001 general elections in
  Bangladesh. No wonder- Amnesty International had honored Kabir with the title
  &quot;prisoner of the conscience&quot;.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Reverting to Partha Banerjee, below is his websites for interested readers.<a href="http://www.geocities.com/chokmoki"> http://www.geocities.com/chokmoki</a>&nbsp;
  And what he wrote to me may apply to many more people, I believe. So If you
  are a south Asian living in USA and want to hold some talk on immigrations and
  human rights issues, it'd be a good idea not to forget Partha Banerjee.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Lastly - a piece of article by Partha Banerjee. He regularly writes a
  column in NY based Bangla weekly <i>Ekhon-i-Somoy</i> . Mr. Banerjee has given me words to write an article exclusively for Mukto-Mona
  readers. Until we receive that, readers may enjoy the one below that I have
  collected from his site.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial Narrow">&quot;Terrorism and Its Real Face: Fake Democracy
  and the Trade Monster's True Colors,&quot; July 2003. By Partha Banerjee,
  Akhon Samoy Weekly. Translated from Bangla by Partha Banerjee.</font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">With the demise of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban
  regime, two staunchly anti-American forces are now gone. It would not be any
  surprise if the U.S. now attempts to destroy other such powers in Syria, Iran
  or North Korea.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Ever since the days of Hafez al-Assad, Syria has been
  resolutely anti-American. Then, since the fall of the Shah and the return of
  the Ayatollah, Iran has become one of the strongest anti-U.S. nations in the
  Middle East. During the decade-long war between Iran and Iraq, the U.S. and
  some Western countries were instigators behind the bloodshed. At that time,
  Saddam Hussein was our &quot;good guy&quot; who received generous financial
  and political endorsement from the Ronald Reagan government. Reagan's National
  Security Advisor Colin Powell and his Middle East Envoy Donald Rumsfeld both
  played important roles in aiding Iraq during the war. Moreover, then-CIA
  director William Casey used a Chilean firm to send to Iraq cluster bombs to
  use against Iran's &quot;human wave&quot; attacks. The point is, Powell,
  Rumsfeld and the U.S. government have long known the war strategies of Saddam
  Hussein. Mr. Rumsfeld, in his drumbeat to bomb Iraq, said that he had
  &quot;cautioned&quot; the Iraqi leader against using weapons of mass
  destruction. But there was no mention of such a warning in state department
  notes of his meeting with Saddam in the eighties.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">The U.S. establishment, with help from mainstream
  media, is now working hard to distort that history, sink the
  &quot;unlikable&quot; parts into oblivion. But the fact is, in spite of all
  the campaigns, one cannot really warp history, however hard he tries to do it.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Let us discuss some other historical facts.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Carlos Mauricio and Martin Almada, two ex-prisoners
  from El Salvador, recently published their real-life stories in various
  international newspapers. In 1983, during the civil war in El Salvador, U.S.
  military consultants infiltrated this tiny Latin American nation. The more
  they went in, the more the government-sponsored militia of El Salvador became
  violent and bled the innocent. Mauricio was a professor of biochemistry at El
  Salvador University. One morning, plainclothes police officers dragged him out
  of his classroom. He was branded as an enemy of the government and a guerilla
  commander. It was purely fear mongering, a tactic the then-Salvador government
  used to scare off the students and intellectuals. This is one of the many
  tactics the infamous School of the Americas (SOA) teaches its students, many
  of whom are known tyrants in Latin America.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Thugs of the militia then handcuffed Mauricio,
  blindfolded him and beat him mercilessly right in front of his students. For
  more than 10 days, they tortured him in a secret chamber. Mauricio is lucky
  that he is still alive to tell his story; many of his colleagues, students and
  compatriots have disappeared from the face of the earth courtesy those SOA
  graduates.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Mauricio, Alamada and a few of their victim friends
  have recently brought a lawsuit against the two Salvadoran military generals
  who were responsible for their torture and humiliation. These two perpetrators
  now live in Florida: the U.S. government gave these human rights violators a
  safe haven.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">On the contrary, another such criminal, Slobodan
  Milosevic of Yugoslavia, received a different kind of treatment. The U.S. in
  fact actively pursued the trial of Milosevic at the International Court. The
  reason behind the different treatment is that this man, just like Saddam
  Hussein, had turned into an &quot;enemy&quot; for his anti-American activities
  and rhetoric.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">At the same time, many other such despots and
  dictators all over the world received direct or indirect political and
  economic support from the U.S. governments via active lobbying of Henry
  Kissinger, Zbignew Brzezinsky, Donald Rumsfeld, George Bush, Sr. or Dick
  Cheney. Kissinger and the CIA took part in staging a bloody coup against
  Chile's popular, democratically elected leader Allende in the seventies. The
  same was done against Indonesia's leader Sukarno in the sixties. In these
  countries, the post-coup years saw extreme violence, killing and anti-people,
  anti-union activities led by two notorious dictators Pinochet and Suharto.
  Both these tyrants still escape international law and justice, in the same way
  Henry Kissinger keeps fleeing justice throughout the world.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Pinochet's victims included laborers, farmers,
  intellectuals, students, teachers, artists, singers and activists. One such
  victim was singer Victor Jara-the Bob Dylan of Chile. Jara was tortured,
  blinded and murdered by Pinochet's militia.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">I didn't meet Jara. But I met Jafar Hamzah Siddique.
  We were roommates in Sunnyside, Queens. Jafar was a law student at the New
  School University and he was from Aceh, a small island off Indonesia. The
  Indonesian militia under Suharto and then under post-Suharto rulers brutalized
  East Timor and Aceh. In August, 2000, Jafar decided to travel to Banda Aceh to
  visit his parents; a few days after he had arrived there, he disappeared. His
  tortured and mangled body was found on the riverbanks of Medan in September.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">I had the opportunity to have a long interview with
  Jafar in April, just a few months before he was killed. Jafar spoke fondly of
  his motherland-about the tiny island Aceh. He spoke about its history and its
  bloody tale of ongoing colonization. Jafar had described how the multinational
  oil corporation Mobil kept occupying and exploiting the land with help from
  the militia defying the wills and protests of thousands of Acehnese men and
  women.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Ibrahim, Sulaiman and other Achenese friends had
  implored Jafar not to go back to Aceh. They warned him that the militia might
  kill him. Jafar said he must go to pay a last visit to his ailing parents. He
  never came back.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">There was a time when Britain, France, Spain, Holland,
  Portugal and Belgium invaded and captured Asian and African countries. After
  plundering the colonized land for centuries, they went back to Europe leaving
  the country bereft of its riches and with feudalistic people put on as its new
  leaders. The new &quot;leaders&quot; of the &quot;independent&quot; country
  kept serving the interests of the colonialists.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">This old version of political colonialism has now
  given way to a new version, something that we can term capital colonialism.
  The U.S. and European governments, with help from the World Bank,
  International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organizations have imposed severe
  sanctions against poor and underdeveloped countries and imposed the strictest
  possible undemocratic, anti-labor economic conditions. In the name of
  globalization, the rich countries under the stewardship of U.S. are wielding
  their fierce capital sticks worldwide. However, with the unilateral,
  unprecedented aggression and occupation of Iraq, it seems the primitive,
  centuries-old brute-force colonization era has returned.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Arial Narrow">Are we then going back to those dark, ancient era of
  monstrous aggression? Often these days, I tend to think that in a way, that is
  actually good for all of us. The sooner the trade monsters shed off their
  masks of civilization and democracy and the sooner their true colors come out,
  the better for us.</font></p>
