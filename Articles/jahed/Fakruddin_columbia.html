	<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-weight:700">T</span></font><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">his 
	morning Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, Honorable Chief Adviser of Bangladesh, 
	delivered a speech at Columbia University on an invitation by its World 
	Leader’s Forum. At the same venue just a few days ago Iranian President 
	Mahmoud Ahmadinajad was invited amid massive protests and gave a speech 
	followed by questions and answers session during which Mr Mahmoud underwent 
	a real tough time. Unlike Ahmedinajad, Dr Fakhruddin, however, was well 
	received by the community of Columbia University, its students, teachers, 
	staff and media. Dr. Fakhruddin’s speech was well-written and he delivered 
	it well. Yet it might not be easy to predict, to what extent the Chief 
	Adviser has been able to dispel the doubts about Bangladesh as “a paradox 
	that has baffled many a pundit,” a phrase taken from his speech. Unlike what 
	we see back home, here in US (and in much of the West) a speech or lecture 
	by a VIP is almost always accompanied by the questions and answers (Q &amp; A) 
	session. But this session didn’t go as well as Dr. Fakhruddin might have 
	predicted. And I am sure--our Chief Adviser, a Princeton alumni himself--has 
	realized it as well. <br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">The 
	title of Dr. Fakhruddin’s speech was “Bangladesh’s Socioeconomic 
	Development: Success, Challenges, and Imperatives.” During his more than 
	half-an-hour speech which started at 11 am, Dr. Fakhruddin spoke on a wide 
	range of issues starting from—Dr. Yunus’ micro-credit; challenges of poverty 
	reduction; Bangladesh’s success in population control, food-production, 
	garments industry, primary education, Non-formal education (NFE) (some may 
	not agree with the way he promoted BRAC’s success as an NGO); migration 
	issue— to current caretaker government’s drive against corruption and 
	resolve to hold elections “before the end of December 2008.” <br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">One very 
	interesting aspect of Dr. Fakhruddin’s speech was his repeated utterance <u>
	“democracy is a necessary but not sufficient condition for good governance.</u>” 
	(May be, General Moyeen has requested him to make it a point every where he 
	goes to!) “Our democratically elected governments during the past 15 years 
	failed to promote good governance and to protect citizens’ rights. We must 
	accept that <u>while democracy may take various forms and manifestations, 
	its ultimate objective is always the same</u>—the rule of law by the will of 
	people. Democracy must put in place checks and balances against abuses of 
	power and corruption,” said Dr. Fakhruddin during his speech. While many of 
	us may agree with Dr. Fakhruddin’s statement about the failure and 
	corruption (moral and fiscal) of country’s mainstream politicians, it’s 
	quite dubious in my opinion that not even once did he mention that about the 
	military’s repeated record of capture and abuse of power in Bangladesh by 
	bypassing country’s constitution. After all, Bangladesh’s age is 35+ years, 
	not 15 years. As for the underlined portion <i>(Note: I did it to make my 
	point. –J.A.)</i> of his remarks, we only wish Mr Chief Adviser’s “various 
	forms and manifestations” of democracy would not remind us of General Ayub’s 
	“Basic Democracy.” The Q &amp; 
	A session started at around 11-35 a.m. I attended the speech on behalf of
	<a target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/">
	<span style="color: black; text-decoration: none">Mukto-Mona.com</span></a> 
	and carried a question with me which read as follows: </span><i>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Recently 
	in Bangladesh, a young cartoonist Arifur Rahman was arrested and is held in 
	prison for a cartoon which used the word, &quot;Mohammed&quot; and which some 
	fundamentalist groups found objectionable. When a similar cartoon was 
	published in the magazine of another&nbsp;fundamentalist group's own newspaper, 
	no allegation of&nbsp;people’s &quot;religious sentiments being hurt&quot; or any such 
	issue arose.&nbsp;We are aware that lawyers have been restricted from 
	representing Mr Rahman and that his own family has not been allowed to meet 
	him. This 
	follows on the heels of the brutal torture and killing of Tribe leader&nbsp;and 
	Activist Cholesh Ritchil and the arrests of hundreds of university teachers, 
	several thousands of&nbsp; people with no prior criminal record. Would you please 
	comment on this horrific state of affairs in Bangladesh with respect to 
	individual rights and freedoms? </span></i>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">During Q 
	&amp; A session I saw Dr. Austin Dacey, a long time friend of Mukto-Mona, United 
	Nations representative of&nbsp;the Center for Inquiry (CFI) Trans-national&nbsp;and 
	assistant editor of Free Inquiry magazine, in the queue on the other side of 
	the hall. The moderator took first four questions from four members of the 
	audience (there were total two lines). I was waiting for my turn. The first 
	four questions were about Dr. Yunus &amp; micro-credit (asked by a Bangladeshi 
	journalist but I couldn’t quite clearly follow it); arrest of cartoonist 
	Arifur Rahman (asked by Dr. Austin); imprisonment and harassment of 
	university teachers, students and others and Bangladeshi refugees in India . 
	In his response although Dr Fakhruddin maintained that his government is 
	“respectful” (?) of the freedom of press, he clearly avoided the issue of 
	cartoonist Arifur Rahman’s arrest. But the question regarding imprisonment 
	and persecution of university teachers, asked by a young South Asian 
	student,&nbsp;shattered the image which Dr. Fakhruddin created of his government 
	through his sugar-coated speech. It was interesting to notice, how Dr. 
	Fakhruddin’s face turned grumpy as the question was asked. And his answer to 
	this particular question was old rhetoric: that it was initially a “minor” 
	incident that was magnified later through some anti-government agents in 
	order to destabilize the country. By the time my turn time came, Ms Clare Oh 
	(who granted me permission to attend the event) came to me telling,” Sorry, 
	media people are not allowed to ask any questions. Q &amp; A session is open 
	only to Columbia students and staff.” Surprised and deeply frustrated, I 
	pleaded saying the first four persons who asked questions were not Columbia 
	students themselves. Ms Clare acknowledged- that was a mistake. I obeyed the 
	rule and came out with Dr. Austin, thanked him for raising the issue of 
	cartoonist Arif’s arrest. If it was not for him, the American audience would 
	not have learned about the example of this government’s policy of 
	appeasement toward Islamic fundamentalists: imprisonment of a boy as young 
	as 19 years only for “hurting religious sentiments” (!) of Muslims (read, 
	Mullahs).&nbsp;As I was coming out, I left the copies of CFI's statement on 
	cartoonist Arifur Rahman issued to Mukto-Mona yesterday on the table with 
	the receptionists near the entrance. Initially I hoped to distribute them 
	among the audience personally but I arrived there late and the speech 
	already started. <br>
	<br>
	How many 
	more years would Bangladesh remain a ”baffling paradox?” Who might know 
	answer to this question: The politicians, bureaucrats, the military, the 
	public or none of them! I thought about this on my way back home.&nbsp;</span></p>
