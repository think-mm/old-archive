								<font face="comic sans ms">Being a moderator 
								myself- while writing my previous mail to you- I 
								did know it well that a moderator is entitled to 
								exercise his/her right to/not to post any 
								article based on the criteria of his/her forum. 
								Yet I wrote to you what unfortunately has been 
								deemed by you as “personal attacks”. I hope you 
								agree&nbsp;that there are&nbsp; established norms to 
								doing&nbsp;things, and turning down an article is no 
								exception to this rule. What hurt me is not the 
								very rejection itself, but the shallow grounds 
								on which my post was rejected. Worse, you didn’t 
								even publish our news of building a school in a 
								remote flood stricken area in Bangladesh, a 
								humanitarian effort by any measures.&nbsp; To the 
								contrary, you assumed that <i>Mukto Mona</i> 
								(MM) is an “anti-Islamic” site and we are 
								rationalizing an &quot;Iraq-like war&quot; in Bangladesh. 
								Nothing could be farther from the truth!&nbsp;MM is 
								neither a &quot;pro-Islamic&quot;, nor an &quot;anti-Islamic&quot; 
								organization; MM ,rather, &nbsp;simply is against all 
								forms of injustices, oppressions and doctrines, 
								be it associated with whatever race, or 
								ethnicity.&nbsp;However, &nbsp;I admit that sometime we 
								may have failed to maintain our equilibrium 
								on&nbsp;some sensitive issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, none is 
								infallible and we are ready to learn from the 
								past.&nbsp;It’s from this stance that many of&nbsp;us have 
								acridly opposed and refuted superficial logics 
								put forward by organizations such as FFI/others 
								in favor of Bush’s War in Iraq. </font></p>

								<font face="comic sans ms">Besides, in recent 
								days MM has come out to be a forum that is now 
								on its way to receive affiliation of such 
								organizations as IHEU. MM also moderates monthly 
								discussion group of South Asian Humanists in New 
								York, sponsored by Center for Free Inquiry 
								(CFI), which in turn is an affiliated 
								organization of International Academy of 
								Humanism&nbsp;, which has&nbsp;at least 12 Nobel laureates 
								to its credit. In 2005, MM is hoping to 
								collaborate with CFI to arrange for an 
								International meeting on Rise of Fundamentalism 
								in South Asia in New York City.</font></p>

								related to our country Bangladesh, MM has 
								assisted in building a school in a remote area 
								under flood rehabilitation program. And it’s all 
								being done by donations made by only a bunch of 
								members who are mostly students and researchers 
								of humanist origin without any political agenda. 
								You’d be glad, I hope, to learn that our first 
								book by Avijit Roy is scheduled to be launched 
								during upcoming 2005 “Ekushe” book fair. We have 
								also lately contributed fiscally to late Prof. 
								Humayun Azad Memorial Project. It may be 
								mentioned-&nbsp; Dr. Azad was an active member of MM 
								until his death. No wonder, MM has been a top 
								most cyber forum among those protesting brutal 
								and cowardly attack on Azad.&nbsp; Our last project 
								includes some monetary gifts to&nbsp;secular activist 
								Shahriar Kabir and his associates who had been 
								injured in a recent road accident in BD.</font></p>

								and you helped Avijit with the idea of a&nbsp;website 
								for MM, yet&nbsp;it may be pertinent to mention a 
								little bit more of background information from 
								what I know.&nbsp;The history of discussing 
								extensively the need for such an organization 
								traces back to as early as the end of 2000. By 
								the end of 2001, some of our members gathered at 
								Center for Inquiry at Buffalo, New York to 
								attend a three-days conference of Liberal 
								Muslims from worldwide. On a scholarship, I 
								myself too was an attendee. Obviously, things 
								didn’t go as planned and ultimately, we, the 
								rationalists of Bangladesh origin, decided to go 
								ahead and form our own organization. It was at 
								that time- in&nbsp;mid 2001-when Avijit (with yours 
								and others' help, I guess)&nbsp;came&nbsp;forward&nbsp;with MM. 
								Prior to that, we all were contributors on 
								similar issues at&nbsp;<i>News from Bangladesh</i> (NFB) 
								&amp;&nbsp;later in <i>Voops</i> (Voice of the 
								Oppressed). You may verify my claim from early 
								archives of MM, <i>Future of Bangladesh</i> and 
								NFB dating back to 2000-2001. Rest is documented 
								in e-mails that I have in my personal 
								collection. This is not to undermine your 
								service to MM, but simply to acknowledge a 
								historical truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

								<p align="justify">Dear Mr Jahed Ahmed,<br>
								<br>
								I apologize to you for causing so much grief for 
								rejecting one of your
								posts. Our intention was not to hurt your 
								feelings, but to do some
								constructive criticism of your post. But it 
								seems like you took the
								criticism personally, misunderstood a few things 
								of our email and indulged
								yourself in attacking our moderators. Please try 
								to understand that even
								Rabindranath Thakur was not above criticism. <br>
								<br>
								Now on some points of your email. Uttorshuri is 
								a strictly moderated
								group. About 3/4th of the posts that we receive 
								get rejected. Since we
								have no control over who is subscribing to our 
								group, we try to maintain
								the quality by rigorously moderating the posts. 
								It’s not a message board
								where everyone has the freedom to post anything. 
								You should have read our
								guidelines and goals when you joined the group.
								<br>
								<br>
								I’m surprised that you have used some labels for 
								the Uttorshuri
								moderators. But neither I nor my co-moderator 
								recalls ever communicating
								with you outside Uttorshuri. If you have formed 
								your opinion by reading
								our messages, I’m truly sorry for not being able 
								to convey you the right
								message. I am not sure what you mean by the term 
								“pro-Islamic”. Our group
								has nothing to do with any particular religion. 
								But yes we do support the
								oppressed Muslims of Iraq, Palestine, and 
								Kashmir. For that matter we
								support any oppressed people on earth. You might 
								have seen our recent
								messages on the indigenous people of CHT and 
								Ahmadiyas of Bangladesh. <br>
								<br>
								We have no interest in finding out what the 
								authors of your article or
								members of your group do or believe. To us, your 
								group is just one of many
								thousands of yahoogroups that exist on the 
								internet. Our comments on the
								rejection email were solely based on the merit 
								of that article. We have
								nothing against the authors of any article, the 
								comments were only based
								on the language and the substance of that 
								particular article. There is
								nothing to feel bad about one’s proficiency in a 
								language that is not even
								his/her first language. Also, a freethinker 
								should be able to open his/her<br>
								heart and mind to any criticism he/she might be 
								subjected to. Don’t you
								think? <br>
								<br>
								You should perhaps know that I was not only a 
								member, but a moderator of
								Muktomona for ten long months. During that time 
								I tried my best to give it
								a different image from what it was initially 
								meant for. MM was vehemently
								against Islam and Muslims. It bragged about 
								being the “breeding ground”
								and sister group of FFI, an anti-Islam group. I 
								felt that a freethinker
								should not be against just one religion, but the 
								wrongs of all religions
								and people. MM website was my idea, guidelines 
								were written by me, lost
								history of our liberation war got a new focus. 
								Membership rose from 150 to
								700. I included people like Pervez Hoodbhoy, 
								Ketaki Kushari Dyson and some
								other keen writers and also discouraged people 
								like Debabrata, who were
								against all Muslims of the world, from spreading 
								their venom. Avijit had
								nothing to say against what I was up to and I 
								had the full privilege of
								making whatever changes I felt needed. <br>
								<br>
								As for MM subscribing our members, our members 
								have been complaining for
								some time now. Those members do not write 
								anywhere else but Uttorshuri and
								we felt a need to clarify to our members that we 
								do not share emails with
								anyone else. That’s all. Hope I have clarified 
								all your allegations. I
								suggest that you stay with Uttorshuri and 
								instead of listening to others,
								see for yourself what we are up to. You may like 
								it. I apologize again if
								we have hurt your feelings by any means.<br>
								<br>
								Wishing you all the best.<br>
								Lopa Tasneem<br>
