										<p align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">First, 
										let's not forget, the persons who led 
										the attack on Taslima Nasrin in
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										India</span> are not any ordinary 
										citizen. They are educated Muslims and 
										elected Members of the Legislative 
										Assembly (MLA); and not one but three of 
										them. Hence we cannot dismiss this 
										incident simply as an act of ignorant, 
										uneducated Muslims, or some members of
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										al-Qaeda</span> (BTW, whenever they 
										carried on an attack,
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										al-Qaeda</span> never denied the 
										responsibility, but in this case, 
										attackers didn't claim any involvement 
										with
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										al-Qaeda</span>). The perpetrators have 
										done it with a cool mind. They uttered 
										furiously but clearly, &quot;We are Muslims 
										first, only then Indians. We shall not 
										tolerate any insult to Islam.&quot; According 
										to news following attack, the three MLAs 
										and their political organization </font>
										<font face="Verdana" color="#333333">
										<font size="2">Majlis Ittehadul 
										Muslimeen (</font> </font>
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">MIM) 
										further issued the threat that if 
										Taslima were to visit
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Andhra Pradesh</span> (AP) again in 
										future, her life would not be spared as 
										it has been&nbsp;this time. In the meantime, 
										Syed Noor-ur-Rehman Barkati, the Shahi 
										Imam of the Tipu Sultan Mosque in
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Kolkata</span> demanded that Taslima be 
										expelled from
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										India</span> or she would be killed. He 
										offered his own Rs 100,000 reward for 
										this in addition to that offered earlier 
										by other undamentalist groups and 
										launched his own slogan, &quot;Taslima hatao, 
										desh bachao.&quot; (Drive Taslima out to save 
										the nation.) </font></div>
									<div style="margin-bottom: 0in">
										<p align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">Needless 
										to say, Taslima Nasrin herself is quite 
										accustomed to this kind of threat and 
										not the one who would stop speaking up 
										for what she believes is true and just. 
										Long live Taslima! But what did we 
										observe in world's largest democracy, so 
										called &quot;secular India&quot; ? The government 
										of India under Congress and its allies 
										including communist CPM performed their 
										duties mainly in verbal condemnation of 
										the act but nothing beyond that. A few 
										activists of MIM were arrested only to 
										be released the next day because MIM is 
										an ally of the ruling Congress party in 
										AP. Prior to the attack, the government 
										has denied Taslima Nasrin's longtime 
										request for Indian citizenship as she's 
										been living in exile for many years due 
										to the fatwa and troubles created by the 
										radical Muslim Mullahs in her homeland
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Bangladesh</span>. </font></p>
										<p align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">If we 
										analyze the utterances of the three 
										Muslim MLAs who attacked Taslima, we may 
										get a better picture not only about the 
										mindset of probably a large number of 
										Indian Muslims, but also beyond. The 
										MLAs' admission that they are Muslims 
										first and only then Indians would only 
										facilitate the effort of some sects of 
										Hindu fundamentalists who are desperate 
										to see
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										India</span> merely as a Hindu state.
										<em>After all,&nbsp;Muslims of India 
										themselves don't consider
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										India</span> as their homeland, </em>the 
										Hindu fundamentalists might think. I 
										know many Muslims would argue and say, 
										those three MLAs are just isolated 
										examples and don't represent all Indian 
										Muslims. My answer in that case would 
										be: true that not all Indian Muslims 
										consider their &quot;Indian&quot; identity 
										secondary, yet unfortunately a vast 
										number of them do. If not, how many 
										&quot;moderate&quot; Muslim organizations have 
										condemned attack on Taslima Nasrin? 
										Sadly, only a few.&nbsp; So one is forced to 
										think, the vast majority of Indian 
										Muslims are either not courageous at 
										all, or they are simply sympathetic to 
										those radical MLAs and their extreme 
										views of Islam. Besides, if personal 
										experience was to be taken into account, 
										then what I have observed during my five 
										years stay (1993-1998)&nbsp;in
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										India</span> as a student&nbsp; confirms the 
										latter. During my post-graduate years in 
										South India , I was staying in a Muslim 
										community hostel, detached from 
										university premise. The hostel had 
										Muslim students from all over
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										India</span> , some studying medicine, 
										some engineering and other subjects. Two 
										things that came out of my observations 
										of and conversations with many Indian 
										Muslim students are worth mentioning. 
										Many of them (much like our own Bangalee 
										war collaborators or &quot;rajakars&quot;) sided 
										with
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; background:">
										Pakistan</span> when we talked of 1971 
										war that led to the birth of
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Bangladesh </span>. Secondly, whenever 
										there was an
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										India</span> vs. Pakistan cricket, 
										substantial number of Indian Muslims 
										would rejoice with
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Pakistan</span>'s victory. One possible 
										explanation was the hostel had a good 
										number of Muslim students from
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Kashmir</span> who are inclined to see 
										Kashmir emerge as an independent state. 
										Yet I found it simply weird and asked a 
										few close friends who were Muslim 
										themselves and&nbsp;had somewhat liberal 
										views. &quot;Yes,&nbsp;it's a shame and disgrace 
										that my fellow Indian Muslims don't 
										consider
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										India</span> as their motherland,&quot; 
										answered one such friend named Suhel who 
										was from
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Hyderabad</span> (what an irony!) 
										studying medicine. </font></div>
									<div style="margin-bottom: 0in">
										<p align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">2. One of 
										the common aftermaths of 9/11 was West's 
										renewed interest in Muslims and Islam. 
										Many otherwise reluctant Westerners 
										started showing a keen interest in 
										reading the Koran, Hadeeth and other 
										books on Islam. One of the most common 
										topics in any political discussion was 
										Jihad. Hundreds of books, leaflets, 
										flyers written by so called &quot;good 
										Muslims&quot; addressed the issue of Jihad 
										and most of them tried to convince- 
										Jihad is not what
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Usama bin Laden</span> or
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										al Qaeda</span> tells us. Jihad, 
										instead, is a moral issue: the resolve 
										and fight against the evils inside one's 
										own self. Many naïve readers (Westerners 
										as well as &quot;modern Muslims&quot;) bought the 
										theory that 9/11 and likewise events 
										were not permitted in Islam and those 
										who did and are doing this are &quot;bad 
										Muslims.&quot; This situation&nbsp;is beautifully 
										explained in following excerpt from &quot;How 
										to debate with a Muslim&quot; written by Ibn 
										Warraq. </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
									<div style="margin-left: 0.58in; margin-right: 0.58in; margin-bottom: 0in">
										<p align="justify"><i><font size="2">
										<font face="Verdana">Muslim scholars 
										themselves referred to sura VIII.67, 
										VIII.39, and Sura II.216 to justify Holy 
										War. Again the context makes it clear 
										that it is the battle field that is 
										being referred to, and not some absurd 
										moral struggle; these early Muslims were 
										warriors after booty, land and women not 
										some existential heroes from the pages 
										of
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Albert Camus</span> or
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Jean-Paul Sartre</span>. Let us take 
										another example: Sura IX. Here I have 
										tried to use where possible translations 
										by Muslims or Arabophone scholars, to 
										avoid the accusation of using infidel 
										translations. However, many Muslim 
										translators have a tendency to soften 
										down the harshness of the original 
										Arabic, particularly in translating the 
										Arabic word jahada, e.g. Sura IX verse 
										73. Maulana Muhammad Ali, of the 
										Ahmadiyyah sect, translates this passage 
										as: <font color="#0000ff">&quot;O Prophet, 
										strive hard against the disbelievers and 
										the hypocrites and be firm against them. 
										And their abode is hell, and evil is the 
										destination.&quot; </font>In a footnote of an 
										apologetic nature,
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Muhammad Ali</span> rules out the 
										meaning &quot;fighting&quot; for jahada. However, 
										the Iraqi non-Muslim scholar Dawood in 
										his Penguin translation renders this 
										passage as: <font color="#0000ff">
										&quot;Prophet, make war on the unbelievers 
										and the hypocrites and deal rigorously 
										with them. Hell shall be their home: an 
										evil fate.&quot;</font></font> </font></i>
									</div>
									<div style="margin-bottom: 0in">
										<p align="justify">
										<font face="Verdana" size="2">Action 
										speaks louder than the words. So far we 
										were fooled to believe- Jihad is some 
										abstract moral struggle, not any 
										violence and Islam is all about 
										tolerance and peace. The recent attack 
										on Taslima Nasrin by persons of such 
										responsible positions as MLAs and the 
										subsequent silent role of &quot;moderate 
										Muslims&quot; only confirms that notion. Thus 
										the assault on Taslima Nasrin, Ayaan 
										Hirsi Ali or
										<span style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc">
										Salman Rushdie</span> is not a trivial 
										issue and there is nothing personal 
										about it. It's, rather, the litmus 
										test&nbsp;whether we wish&nbsp;to see values such 
										as liberty, freedom, secularism and 
										rationalism to flourish or perish. If we 
										don't&nbsp;make our choice now, I am afraid&nbsp;oneday 
										we'll be left with no choice&nbsp;at all.
