	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">Ali Sina has made a call among 
	American voters to vote George W. Bush so that the world would be a much 
	safer and probably, he thinks, a better place too. He has analyzed 1<sup>st</sup> 
	round of presidential debate and has made fierce attempt to show before 
	readers- Bush Junior is a better choice over Senator Kerry. If I recollect 
	my acquaintance and interactions with Mr. Sina some 3 years ago; principle 
	he stands by is- <i>‘kill Islam, the sick ideology; but not the ordinary 
	Muslims since there do exist vast amount of good people even among Muslims’</i>. 
	He analyzed Mohammed’s life and termed him as a ‘narcissist’ in his essay <i>
	“Why I Left Islam.”</i> I, too, personally don’t hold Muhammad in high 
	respect and believe- he was a brain manipulator. Yet reading Ali’s recent 
	rhetoric for Bush and against Kerry, in particular, his wrath against 
	Senator Kerry’s utterance <i>‘to reach out Muslims’ </i>has posed me a 
	question. While analyzing Muhammad’s activities; has Ali himself turned into 
	a sadist lately? If not, why is he so hypersensitive to the generic 
	connotation of a particular religious community? How did he fail to 
	apprehend- an ideology may be parochial, however, that in itself doesn’t 
	make all people belonging/born to it dangerous? Or, has he deviated from his 
	earlier ideological stance? Let’s recall what Ali said: </span></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">“</span><i><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">Today 
		Islam represents more danger to the world than Nazism presented 70 years 
		ago. I don't think &quot;reaching out to Muslims&quot; is a right policy. I think 
		we should stand tough against Islam and its terrorism. Muslims interpret 
		&quot;reaching out&quot; as the sign of weakness and this encourages them to 
		continue with their quest to conquer the world.”</span></i></p>

	influential Saudis living in USA back home in a jet including members of bin 
	Laden family! On fourth day of 9/11, Saudi ambassador was the chief guest in 
	a dinner party at White House! Yet- Ali thinks- Bush Junior is tough on 
	supporters/promoters of terrorists. Coming to Saddam: doesn’t Ali know – how 
	Saddam ascended to power with help of CIA? Doesn’t Ali know – who provided 
	Saddam with weapons and support during war with Iran? Why did Rumsfeld fly

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: Arial">Is Ali suffering from

	When the president lets God tell him what to do, it violates the spirit of 
	democracy. In a democracy, it is the people, not God, who make the 
	decisions. The president is supposed to represent the will of the people. 
	Ali should know that a sane president must rely on facts, intelligent 
	analysis, and rational thought-not divine inspiration to make a judgment. 
	Once the president lets God's voice replace the human mind, we are back in 
	the Middle Ages, back in the very situation our revolution was supposed to 
	get us out of.&nbsp; <span style="color: red">Will this President, who has 
	been attributed as '<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/18259">The
