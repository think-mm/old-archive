	&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">Just before 
	coming to USA back in 2000, I decided to meet a few of Dhaka's 
	intelligentsia in person. Prof. Shamsher Ali was one among them. When I met 
	him in his Dhanmondi's residence, I was impressed. He was well spoken, well 
	read and a decent man in all respects. His library cum study room had 
	shelves all round filled with books from all disciplines: from science to 
	history, philosophy and literature. Although well read and familiar with the 
	methodology of science (he holds a Ph.D. possibly, from Edinburg, UK), it 
	was not long before I discovered-indeed, Dr. Ali is totally a confused man. 
	He strongly believes-Quran does contain hidden clues about science. To prove 
	his points, he's written a bulky book titled &quot;Scientific Indications in Holy 
	Quran&quot; with the fund from Islamic Foundation of Bangladesh. His obsession 
	about &quot;Quranic Science&quot; is so extreme that he thinks, Quran even has 
	indications about DNA, the macro molecule of life. Interested readers may 
	like to go through an article I wrote back in 2001 covering the issue of 
	Quranic Science (Link:
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/jahed/English/hijacking_glory.html">
	https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/jahed/hijacking_glory.htm</a> ). 
	Recently, I've been reminded of Dr. Ali after going through Dr. Biplab Pal's 
	zealot effort in Mukto-Mona forum in support of a nonsense called 
	&quot;scientific spiritualism.&quot; Like Dr. Ali, Dr. Pal is also well read beyond 
	doubt, and energetic in producing volumes of articles each day. But just 
	like Ali, Pal is also a confused man. Let me make my points. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0pt" align="justify">
	<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Spirituality&quot; is one 
	of the most vague and unexplicitly defined nouns in English language. (I 
	find it unnecessary to quote the definitions from the English dictionaries 
	since most readers, I guess, are already familiar with it). To the contrary, 
	science deals with facts and concrete facts only. Anything ambiguous and 
	undefined is not science, be it how much ever useful. Yet Biplab Pal has 
	made attempts to rationalize the term &quot;spirituality&quot; by adding the flavor of 
	science. This kind of effort is not new. Like Biplab picking just only one 
	component of Buddhism, dumping the rest, and calling it &quot;scientific 
	spirituality; we know there exist ardent Christians/Muslims/Hindus claiming 
	-they have found some components of Science in Bible/Quran/Geeta. By doing 
	so, Pal has set just one more example to the hundreds already in existence 
	toward being &quot;a promoter of science and spirituality at the same time.&quot; Even 
	falsification, which Pal is so fond of, cannot always help us in 
	distinguishing between science and a pseudoscience. For instance, 
	falsification alone doesn't make the pseudo claim &quot;astrology is a science&quot; a 
	complete lie. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0pt" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none; margin: 5.0pt 0pt" align="justify">
	<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At times, it's not 
	difficult to see Biplab's gross confusions and lack of understanding in 
	distinguishing between the terms such as &quot;spirituality,&quot; &quot;science&quot; and 
	&quot;truth.&quot; If we take the subject matter of truth, then we see, some people 
	always existed in the history to seek and live for it. Even long before we 
	knew any such thing as &quot;science&quot;, Socrates declared: &quot;if you take my advice, 
	then think little about Socrates and a great deal more about the truth.&quot; 
	Does what Socrates said then become a &quot;scientific spirituality&quot;? If he were 
	to be alive today, probably, Socrates would have been the first person to 
	have opposed such nonsense. The core constituent of Biplab Pal's &quot;scientific 
	spirituality&quot; lies in seeking knowledge about self and finding the meaning 
	of life. Well, quest for the meaning of life and a true understanding about 
	self had always been the central topic in philosophy. Yet we don't call it 
	science because of what I said earlier: science deals with facts and doesn't 
	have any direct answers to questions such as &quot;what's the purpose of life?&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, what Biplab 
	mistakenly is trying to call &quot;scientific spirituality,&quot; has always occupied 
	the minds of thinkers in all ages even long before we knew anything about 
	modern science and its methodology. Calling them &quot;scientific spirituality,&quot; 
	in my opinion, would be also a gross level underestimation of those great 
	thinkers who dared to think beyond the borders without any acquaintance with 
	science. Let me illustrate. Socrates' famous dictum &quot;Know Thyself&quot; is known 
	to every one. Although it's unlikely that he heard, or read about Socrates, 
	Bangalee Mystic Lalon (born about two thousands years after Secretes) also 
	said the same in his song: <br>

	<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, let's consider 
	Spinoza's pantheism. Pantheism (not polytheism) finds God in every thing 
	present in nature. God, therefore, is multifaceted, as a pantheist believes. 
	Each of the above example could be related to &quot;spirituality&quot; but terming 
	them &quot;scientific&quot; would be nonsense. None among Socrates, Lalon, or Spinoza 
	was atheist. They were believers (yet great thinkers). And belief is not a 
	realm of science. <b>Biplab also says it wrong when he says &quot;Einstein 
	considered Buddhism as the only religion close to method of science-he 
	didn't differ from what I said.&quot; (

	Indeed, what Einstein said is- if he were asked to chose a religion, the one 
	he'd pick is Buddhism. To the best of my knowledge, he never said, Buddhism 
	is close to science. The philosophy which he espoused is &quot;cosmic religion.&quot;</font></b><font size="3">
	Even there, he didn't try to defend it in the name of science. Einstein 
	never thought Science alone could be our guide.

	<span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge about his 
	own self and others made Socrates a humble man who didn't hesitate to 
	announce: &quot;The only thing I'm sure of about myself is- I know nothing.&quot; And 
	our friend Biplab Pal? Whoever disagrees with him, he thinks, is either an 
	&quot;ignorant,&quot; or &quot;a bad reader.&quot; Interestingly, since the beginning of the 
	debate, I didn't see any one agreeing with his parochial and limited views 
	except for his erudite editor friend who wrote a lengthy article in his 
	defense even though the gentle man doesn't know, himself, what falsification 
	is, nor can he even spell Karl Poppers name [<b>Carl Paiper!</b>] correctly 
	(readers may read
	<a href="http://www.vinnomot.com/QKhan/KhanFalsification.pdf">his Bangla 
	article</a> defending Pal). I wouldn't judge Biplab Pal by his editor 
	friend. But I must point out, If Biplab Pal's purpose was to impress us, 
	he's already succeeded. If it was, rather, to explain a topic explicitly and 
	logically, then he's not. The reason could be : may be, we don't read as 
	much as Biplab does, or Biplab doesn't understand as much as he reads. Or 
	may be, he understands what he reads but cannot explain in a sensible way. 
	Another possibility which I cannot rule out is-&nbsp; from one of his posts I 
	know, as a youth, Biplab Pal spent considerable time as a Ramakrishna 
	disciple. He, however, now is a man of science. Yet it is not unlikely that 
	his childhood mesmerization about Ramakrishna's philosophy sometimes tries 
	to find some scientific basis deep down his subconscious mind. Therefore, he 
	comes up with topics such as &quot;scientific spirituality&quot;. </span></p>
