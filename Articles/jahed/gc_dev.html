  Great minds think alike</span></i></font><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">. 
	Very similar to What Paul Kurtz said above was said by a humanist philosopher of Bangladesh, some thirty to forty years 
  ago. His name is Govinda Chandra Dev, popularly known as Professor G. C. 
  Dev. “Any philosophy that has no connection with reality of life is merely an 
  abstract theory and such philosophy is not a real philosophy,” is one of the 
  famous sayings of Prof. G. C. Dev. For those of us who think <i>“plain living 
  and high thinking”</i> is just a theory, and cannot be a life style, I would 
  say, they (or us) may not have heard of Professor G. C. Dev. He lived his 
  whole life as a <i>“plain living and high thinking&quot; </i>man until he was 
	killed by the Pakistani Army along with thousands of other innocent 
  Bengali males, females, and children in Dhaka on the night of 25<sup>th</sup> 
	March, 1971.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. G.C. Dev was a leading philosopher 
  of his time both at home and abroad. Excluding occasional 
  intervals of a year or two, until his death he remained the general 
  secretary of <i>Pakistan Philosophical Congress</i>. Equally, at international 
  level he was honored with several accolades such as the fellowship of the United Kingdom’s <i>The Union of the Study of the 
  General Religions</i> and of University of Michigan, USA. In September, 1966, 
  on an invitation as a visiting professor he went to Wilkes-Barre College 
  (present Wilkes University) of PA, USA. As a mark of his commendable knowledge 
  and for the publicity of his humanistic philosophy; on 26<sup>th</sup> May in 
  1967, there was founded <i>The Govinda Dev Foundation for World Brotherhood.
  </i>Because of the invitation of the same institute, he once again went to 
  the USA in October of 1970, just a few months prior to his death.<i> </i>&nbsp;From the 
  archives of Wilkes College it is known that- Dr. Dev within a very short time 
  became a popular teacher as well as an orator.</font></span></p>

  <span style="font-weight: 700"><font size="2">Birth and Childhood:</font></span><font size="2">
	</font> </span>
  <font size="2">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">G. C. Dev was born on 1st 
  January in 1907 in the village of </span><i>
  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">Lauta</span></i></font><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2"> 
  in <i>Panchakhanda Porgana</i> (present <i>Biyani Bazar Thana</i>) of <i>
  Sylhet</i> district in Bangladesh. Although his father was a small 
	business-man, Dev’s family, however, initially was&nbsp;&nbsp; financially stable. 
	Over the time his father faced a tremendous fiscal loss and having not being able 
  to cope up psychologically with the loss had died 
  consequently while leaving his son Dev as a small child. The incident had left a deep 
  impact on child Dev’s mind and he left home at a very early stage of his 
  life. For the rest eight long years, Dev was reared with affection by a 
  Christian missionary which provided him financial and moral-spiritual 
  guidance. Although Dev didn't forget 
  his early experience with Christian missionaries, he nevertheless came up 
  with his own personal philosophy over the time. We will come to that later.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

  <span style="font-weight: 700"><font size="2">Academic Education:</font></span><font size="2">&nbsp; 
	</font> </span>
  <font size="2">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">As a student, Dev proved 
  himself meritorious from the early academic stage of his life. In 1925, he 
  passed through the Matriculation from the local <i>Panchakhanda&nbsp; Horo Govinda</i> 
  high school (the school still is in existence in <i>Biyani Bazar, Sylhet,</i> 
  BD) with 1<sup>st</sup> class. From there he qualified higher secondary 
  examination in 1927, again in 1<sup>st</sup> class with special honor in 
  Logic. At this stage, G.C. Dev moved to Calcutta. In 1929, from the Calcutta 
  Sanskrit College he obtained B.A. (honors) degree in Philosophy. Subsequently 
  in 1931, Dev obtained M.A. degree from Calcutta University with 1<sup>st</sup> 
  class while standing at the top of the list among all his peers. There Dev 
  came across prominent thinkers and philosophers of that time such as Dr.
  Hiralal Haldar, Dr. Surendra Das Gupta and Prof. Krishna Chanda 
  Bhttacharya.In 1944 G.C. Dev received his Ph.D. upon submission of 
  long-researched thesis entitled </span>
  <span style="font-family: Verdana; ">“Reason, Intuition and 
  Reality”</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"> which was 
  later published as a book named </span>
  <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight:700">“Idealism and Progress.”</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"> 
  Dr. G.C. Dev then started his career as a lecturer in Calcutta’s Ripon College. 
  Due to chaotic situations during World War II, the college was transferred 
  from Calcutta to Dinajpur (now in Bangladesh). At the same time Dr. Dev also 
  moved to Dinajpur as a professor. Although later in 1945 the college 
  was re-shifted to Calcutta, Prof. Dr. Dev decided to stay back in Dinajpur 
	where he established Surendranath<i> College</i>, and became its founding 
  principal. In the July of 1953, Dr. G.C. Dev joined Philosophy department of 
  Dhaka University, Bangladesh. As an additional responsibility, he also served 
  as the house tutor of Dhaka hall</span></font><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2"> 
  (present Shahidullah hall) in 1957. In the same year in July, he was appointed 
  as the provost of Jagannath hall and remained so until April 1970. In 1963, G.C. Dev was appointed as the chairman 
	in the dept. of philosophy and 
  became a full professor on 1<sup>st</sup> July of 1967.</font></span></p>

	</font> </span>
  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2">A distinguishing feature of 
  Prof. G.C. Dev was that- unlike many of his contemporaries, he didn’t confine 
  philosophy and its wisdom simply to the sphere of academic discipline, or as 
  an abstract subject matter. He was a man of action alongside being a man of 
  wisdom. This trait has been reflected in various stages of his life. To name a 
  few instances:&nbsp;</font></span></p>

  </span><span style="font-family: Verdana">While he was provost of the Jagannath 
  hall at Dhaka University, he helped many students by providing shelter, cash 
  money and advices. To publicize life-oriented and humanist philosophy, Prof. G.C. Dev worked hard and set up “Philosophy House” in Dhaka. Many 
  educational and cultural programs took place under the lead of Prof. G.C. Dev 
  in that house where students, teachers and public took part. The house 
  also had significant number of books on philosophy. Though the house became 
  extinct later, Dr. Dev donated bulk of his wealth during his life time to 
  Dhaka University, which helped later establishment of “Dev 
  Center for Philosophical Studies (DCPS)” 
  in 1980 at Dhaka University</span></font><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">. 
  Ever since its birth, two journals are regularly published by the <i>Govinda 
  Dev Darshan Gabeshana Kendra</i> (DCPS). These are: “Philosophy and Progress” 
  (in English) and “<i>Darshan O Pragati”</i> (in Bangla). There is a 
  departmental library named Dev Smriti Pathagar<i> </i>(“Dev Memorial Library”) 
  which contains about 2000 books and journals. In 1986 the Bangladesh 
  government awarded him the <i>Ekushe Padak</i> posthumously.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

  </span></font><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As mentioned before, Dev was a <i>
  plain living and high thinking</i> man. From the attires he used in his daily 
  life- <i>white dhoti , panjabi </i>(a kind of loose shirt)<i> and shawl--</i>it was often difficult to judge 
	that within the plain clothed person lay an 
  erudite scholar. He was also known as a man with remarkable sense of humor. He 
  would enjoy making fun of himself. One such legend comes 
  from his own narrations: once on a trip he was traveling in steamer while 
  standing in front of the door of upper class. Coincidentally, same time there 
  was present the officer in charge of ticket checking. The officer was a bit 
  suspicious to find an outwardly ordinary guy near upper class. After a scanty 
  observation, the officer made the indirect but stern comment, obviously 
  targeting Dr. G.C. Dev: <i>“(mind you!) this is upper class!” </i>Dev sensed 
  the target of officer’s comment easily and promptly replied: “My dear 
  friend. My appearance is third class, but my ticked indeed is indeed (for) upper 
  class.” &nbsp;</font></span></p>

  Idealism and Dr. G. C. Dev: </font> </span>
  <font size="2">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">By virtue of birth and family 
  environment, Dev as a child was familiar with most core concepts of the ancient 
  Indian philosophy, in particular Hinduism and <i>Sanskrit</i> tradition. 
  However, his childhood experience and affectionate care he received from the Christian missionaries 
	was always vivid in his memory. In fact, 
  the two parallel but seemingly paradoxical aspects of philosophy that later 
  paved the way for Dev to synthesize his own and unique personal philosophy 
  were: </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic">
  spiritualism</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"> and
  </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic">materialism</span><span style="font-family: Verdana">.</span></font><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2">

  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
    <span style="font-family: Verdana; background-color:#FFFF00"><font size="2">“If my faith in spiritualism turns out to

    <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; background-color:#FFFF00">materialism</span></font><span style="font-family: Verdana; background-color:#FFFF00"><font size="2">

    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2">Further he said he never 
  would have realized the importance of materialistic possessions, had his 
  father not faced the pitfall of the poverty from a stable wealth and richness 
  all-of-a-sudden basis. Therefore, both knowledge of spirituality and 
  materialism he experienced during his childhood and adolescence period equally helped G.C. Dev embrace many obstacles of life with a smiling and inspirational face. 
  The strong spiritual faith, on one hand, helped him during dark stage of his 
  life; on the other hand, equally strong experience of materialism took him 
  close to poor class and helped him become one of them. He said:&nbsp;</font></span></p>
  <blockquote>

    <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic"><font size="2">“Both spiritualism 
    and materialism have enriched my life. Despite labor and hindrance, rewards 
    and insults, I adhered to the synthetic philosophy consisting of both;

  <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Here G.C. Dev differs significantly from 
  many of his contemporaries. </b>To him, philosophy is more than just 
  all-metaphysics, or all-abstract analytical erudition. Neither has he 
  considered abstract theory as core basis of philosophy, nor has he agreed- the 
  duty of philosophy should be mere analysis of linguistics without any 
  theoretical basis. <b>I feel tempted to cite here a strangely similar comment 
  made by today’s esteemed humanist philosopher Paul Kurtz:</b></font></span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
    <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-style: italic; font-weight:700">
	<font size="2">“I am critical of the 
    kind of philosophy that prevails in Anglo-American philosophical circles. I 
    consider much of this philosophy irrelevant. It is like an ingrown toenail, 
    turned within itself, festering with sharp linguistic distinctions and 
    painful sophistries. The trouble with technical philosophy is that it has 
    incapacitated philosophy proper, so that it hobbles about like a mendicant 
    friar cloistered in a distant monastery on a remote island in the midst of 
    an empty sea.” &nbsp;</font></span></p>

  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2">What is even stranger- long 
  ago Prof. G.C. Dev announced:</font></span><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
	<b><font color="#993300">“When 
  today’s philosophy is floating randomly and without any direction in the ocean 
  of life like a rudder-less boat; it is of utmost importance to establish its 
  link to a productive life.”</font></b> According to philosopher Prof. G.C. Dev, the 
  origin and development of philosophy lies in natural human curiosity about 
  life and nature, a tendency to glorify life further. Therefore, philosophy 
  cannot exist without people. However, we need to keep in mind- G.C. Dev 
  didn’t rule out the importance of metaphysical questions in Philosophy. All he 
  said- &nbsp;such should not be the sole objective of philosophy since there 
	are other 
  areas of studies, which are no less connected to life, if not more, than 
  metaphysics: Social philosophy, Political philosophy and of course, philosophy 
  of history. </font> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black">
	<font size="2">Interestingly, to philosopher 
  G.C. Dev, conflicts/tensions between idealism and materialism do not exist!
	</font>
  </span><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana">“The so called conflict between the 
  two is not so much as a matter of theory, as it is a matter of mentality”,</span></font><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2"> 
  announces Dev. &nbsp;He continues:&nbsp;</font></span></p>
  <blockquote>

	<font size="2">“When we are told- 
    materialism finds source of life and conscience in matter alone, or 
    materialism believes only in senses and rejects intuition; it appears to me, 
    through such statement we only uphold the skeleton of materialism, not its 
    essence. On the other hand, when we are told (about spiritualism)- the main 
    spirit existing behind the&nbsp; universe is the sole origin of matter, life and 
    conscience; then also it equally appears to me, we are highlighting only the 
    external traits of spirituality while excluding its essence…….. If the 
    biological need leads a human to materialism, then spiritual need lead 
    him/her to spiritualism. They both are complementary. Adhering to one while 
    rejecting another is something beyond question. For the sake of mankind’s 
    total welfare, fulfilled and peaceful life, it is crucial that we reconcile 
    and synthesize the two. Materialistic vs. spiritualistic, secular vs. 
    religious, natural vs. supernatural, etc conflicts would soon come to an 
    end, mankind’s life would be based on the synthesis and reconciliation of 
    both materialism and idealism; and philosophers, scientists and religious

	<font size="2">Features of 
  his spiritual beliefs:</font></span><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"> 
  Dev found his own way in philosophy through adoption of a 'middle path' which 
	is a combination of 
  ancient 'moderate philosophy' of Buddha, Veda-Upanishad and Bhagabhat Geeta. For Dev, it 
  didn’t contradict itself with the Western monotheistic religions. His spiritual 
  ideology was based on the unity of the universe and mankind, as pointed out in 
  Upanishad-Veda. This ideal of unity is not based on any provincial religious 
  outlook, or any personal God, even though he believed in single entity as 
  the ultimate driving force behind the universe. Such ideal, if analyzed 
  carefully, is the essence of all historical Eastern and Western religions and 
  philosophies.&nbsp;According to this philosophy, the same entity manifests itself 
  in different forms and angles in whole universe- sometimes as a matter, 
  sometimes as a conscience. At one place if it is single, in other place, same 
  is present in multiples. The life and the universe should be explained based on 
  the inner unity of what we may see in multiples, that’s the opinion Dr. G.C. 
  Dev held. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana">Philosopher Dev solicited 
  the unity among different persons, nations, races and in the spheres of 
  different levels of human relations such as at social, political and religious 
  based on this view.</span></font><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2">

  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through life-long 
  observation, Dev had seen it for himself common people are lured more 
  toward faith than logic. They find religion more appealing than philosophy. 
  This is said to be one of the main reasons, why Dev adhered to synthetic 
  idealism. As just mentioned- the kind of religion he believed in was not a 
  conventional one; on the contrary, it was a universal religion based on love 
  and admiration for all mankind of the planet--one that would not, and need not 
  compete with other religions to exert its “superiority”. In this sense, Dev 
  was a believer, but an altruistic one, so rarely seen in today’s society.&nbsp;

	Having been born in a place which witnessed G.C. Dev's birth, like many other people 
  of Bangladeshi origin, I heard of his name too, although not in details. I 
	knew him as a philosopher-cum-a-martyr of 1971 
  war and a life long bachelor. An interesting fact however remained hidden to me until a few days ago: 
	that Dr. G.C. Dev 
  indeed had a foster-son at the later stage of his life who is now living in 
  New York State!&nbsp;Thanks to a fellow writer friend who also lives in New 
	York.<br>
	Here it is:<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;A jubilant and young 
  student of M.A. in Bengali literature (passed in 1962) at the Dhaka University was 
  lured so much by Prof. G.C. Dev’s altruistic philosophy that he had no hesitations 
  whatsoever to embrace G.C. Dev as his idol and foster-father. The same student 
	also obtained his diploma in Journalism from the Dhaka University and came to 
	the USA in 1963. Here he did his M.A. in Mass Communication<i> </i>from

	Prakash Dutta whose wife Dr. Purabi Basu is also equally eminent and well 
	known among the expatriate Bangalee community living in New York and beyond. 
	The couple is settled 
  in a suburban area of New York State and has a son 
  and a daughter. Below is how Dr. Jyoti P. Dutta responded when I requested him

  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2">It goes without 
  saying- by virtue of the advancements in science and technology mankind is now much more powerful 
  it was in the past. The new discoveries that we are watching almost on 
  a day-to-day basis is changing the world scenario drastically and rapidly. But 
  despite such materialistic progress, we have yet to find a way out toward 
  a long lasting and peaceful coexistence. Alongside new discoveries, we are  
  flooded with news of killings and violence committed mostly by none 
  but our fellow humans! &nbsp;</font></span></p>

  <span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. G.C. Dev was killed in

  Whether one believes in the existence of soul or not, or for that matter, in Dev’s synthetic philosophy; it would be quite safe to conclude- 
  examples of altruism, love for mankind, and selflessness shown by Prof. Dr. G.C. Dev would inspire generations to come--both within and beyond Bangladesh. 
	If not all, at least those--who consider their first and foremost 
  identity as a human being--would not and cannot be forgetful of G.C. Dev. </span>
