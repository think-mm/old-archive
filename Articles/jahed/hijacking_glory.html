  <i>
  <p align="justify">&quot;Just as people came to understand that GOD does not
  cause lightning, gradually society will understand that consciousness and
  other things attributed to the Almighty arise naturally, too&quot;</p>
  <p align="justify">-James Larrick, Director of Palo Alto Institute of
  Molecular Medicine, Mountain</p>
  <p align="justify">View, California</p>
  </i>
  <p align="justify">One of the very frequent and tricky sayings of Islamist as
  to what Allah really is or how He came (if at all!) into being is that this is
  something beyond the sphere of our understanding. We as ordinary human beings
  cannot perceive origin of Allah. You if then ask them <font color="#ff0000">&quot;When
  you yourself are clearly admitting that Allah is beyond your perception then
  how come you say, He knows everything, He is the supreme power? How do you
  believe in something that is beyond your power of perception? Why do you then
  criticize people who believe in hilarious stories of fairy or <i>Draccula</i>?
  Isn’t it the same as your blind belief in Allah/Ishwar/God? &quot;</font>.
  No sensible answer at least so far I myself have come across! Nevertheless
  their dogma hypnotized them so much that they remain same whatever they study
  in real life or whoever they become when they grow up (physically only?). No
  wonder after becoming involved in science (but they never develop scientific
  attitudes despite studying science) they often face contradictions, their
  belief that is mostly based on their mythological scripture constantly
  encounter the scientific facts. They can neither quit their hereditary belief <i>(irony
  is they will seek treatment and would try hard to get rid in case they inherit
  something that has potentials to harm them physically e.g. a defective gene
  that may make them susceptible to fatal diseases like cancer, sickle-cell
  anemia, diabetes, to name a few)</i><font color="#ff0000"> </font>NOR can they
  accept literally what science says. In their desperate bids to reconcile the
  dogma they harbor in mind and the real science many of them come up with
  bizarre hypothesis like the most common one that says-</p>
  <dir>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">1) Holy (!) Scripture like Quran has many scientific
    indications (<font color="#ff0000">note here the noun &quot;indication&quot;
    is a very cunning term coined by them as it does not require Quran to be a
    literal source of a scientific discovery!).</p>
    </font></b>
    <p align="justify">Another common propaganda is one mentioned below:</p>
  </dir>
  <dir>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">2) Many scientists believe in GOD</b> <b><font color="#ff0000">(here
    Islamists do not mind to include many non-muslims as well whom otherwise
    they address as &quot;<i>Ihudi&quot;, &quot;Kafir&quot;, &quot;Nasara</i>&quot;).</p>
    </font>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    </dir>
    <p align="justify">On above bizarre hypothesis-1: </b>It is hypothesized by
    Islamists (equally there are Hindu, Christian bigots for similar claims with
    respect to their Scriptures) that Quran and Hadeeth have many scientific
    indications. If you examine any of the citations that is claimed to indicate
    a scientific fact in comparison with real science you apparently can not
    help laughing and asking following-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When did Islamist start their claim (i.e. a particular verse correlates
      with a modern scientific fact)? Trust me here, never could they dare to
      say that they have been claiming it even before that discovery came into
      picture. Why is this that the Islamists are incapable of discovering
      anything scientifically based on clues (?) mentioned in Quran? Why do they
      make claim only after a discovery is made? Is there a single significant
      discovery if ever in human history that is based on clues in Quran? Answer
      is No, No and No!!</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">On the contrary, most discoveries in science are a not a
  result of any single-step effort. Rather it requires/required years (sometimes
  hundreds) of ingenious and laborious thinking. Islamists know well that it
  will be a great joke to try to find out a literal scientific fact in Quran.
  Therefore in order to preserve their belief (also business?) from fading away
  they coin the verse even if it is far away and vague in sharp contrast to
  scientific meaning. Then they play the following trick!</p>
  <ul>
    <font color="#ff0000">
    <li>Whenever questioned, they say the literal meaning does not apply here.
      It is the implied meaning (here is the chance to manipulate meaning and
      interpret different way!!) that correlates with science. To add some
      glamour often they hire some pseudo scientists with Ph.D. degree and get
      it certified </font>(The writer personally communicated with one such
    often quoted pseudo-scientists more than once regarding a verse of a often
    quoted Hadeeth in support of an Embryological fact BUT no reply received so
    far even after more than 6 months!)</li>
  </ul>
  <font color="#ff0000"><b>
  <ul>
  </b>
  <li>Interestingly they too occasionally say that Quran is not a book of
    science! That’s right but question is who started this propaganda
    regarding Quran? Do they mean Quran is not a book of science RATHER book of
    all kinds of knowledge? Isn’t that even a more dangerous dogma?</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  </font>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Of hundreds of such dishonest of examples where Quran/Hadeeth
  is quoted in support of modern science, I will briefly discuss just one.</p>
  <p align="justify">DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) is known as hereditary unit of
  life. Ever since it’s structural elucidation in 1953 this ‘master molecule
  of life’ alone has given rise to several modern disciplines of Biology such
  as Molecular Biology, Molecular Genetics, Molecular Medicine, Biotechnology,
  Genetic Engineering and Gene Therapy. However it took scientists nearly
  hundred years to unravel the basic compositions and structural organizations
  of DNA. Although Jim Watson and Francis Crick scientists are most well known
  for their 1953 double-helix model, any Biologist/Biochemist knows that several
  earlier observations paved the way to 1953 breakthrough (termed as <i>&quot;The
  greatest achievement of science in the twentieth century by Sir Peter Medawar).
  </i>Some of the important events around DNA are-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1869-First isolated
    <li>1879-Mitosis (cell division) observed
    <li>1900-Re-discovery of Mandel’s work
    <li>1902-Chromoseme theory of hereditary
    <li>1909-The word <i>gene</i> coined
    <li>1911- Fruit flies illuminate the chromosome theory
    <li>1941 One gene-One enzyme Theory
    <li>1943-X-ray Diffraction of DNA
    <li>1944-DNA, transforming principle
    <li>1952-Genes are made of DNA
    <li>1953-Double-Helix Model put forward by Jim Watson, Francis Crick and
      Wilkins (awarded Nobel prize in 1963)</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="justify">Dear readers, I am not here to teach you DNA. My purpose is
  to tell that <b>like above DNA discovery, almost all great discoveries had
  proceeded through sequential events and there is no room for Quran or Bible in
  that! </b>Now how would you react if one claims that Quran provides clue about
  DNA?? This is what indeed is claimed by some Islamist! According to Islamic
  scientists, following verse of Quran denotes to DNA.</p>
  <i>
  <p align="justify">&quot;And in your nature and in (that of) all the animals
  which He scatters (over the earth) there are messages for people of assured
  faith&quot; (45:4)</p>
  <p align="justify">(Reference:&quot; Scientific Indications in The Holy Quran,
  3<sup>rd</sup> cover page, written by a board of researchers of which Dr.
  Shamser Ali of Dhaka University is the Chairman and published by Islamic
  Foundation Bangladesh. This book is full of hundreds of such ambiguous
  examples!)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  </i>
  <p align="justify">Now if you ask any of the following questions what probably
  Islamist will say in reply is you are suffering from lack of belief in Allah.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>How did the Islamist interpret the above version before they became
      aware of DNA?
    <li>Why could no Islamist explain the mystery behind DNA if it was already
      mentioned in their Quran UNTILL 1953 when it was done by ‘<i>Nasara</i>’
      scientists?
    <li>Is there single scientist in the world (including those whom Islamists
      often use as a reference) who used Quran/Hadeeth under reference in their
      scientific research publications like those in ‘<i>Nature’,
      ‘Science’, ‘Cell’</i> etc? Why do we see Islamic scientists
      appreciate Quranic verses in books that are published most of the time by
      Saudi fund ??</li>
  </ol>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><b>Bizarre hypothesis-2: </b>Islamists often say there are
  many Muslim scientists OR some great scientists too believe in God. Both are
  true! But what is not true is <font color="#ff0000">among prominent scientists
  who are Muslim, none (yes I repeat, none!!) of them have ever said that they
  made discovery based on clues in Quarn! On the contrary, to all of them, being
  Muslim has nothing to do with them being a creative scientist.</font> This
  applies<font color="#ff0000"> </font>to all famous Muslim scientists. Coming
  to second claim that some scientists believe in God, yes, some do indeed! But
  note here kind of God they believe most often is absent in the descriptions of
  Scriptures like Quran, Bible or Geeta. Rather often they identify themselves
  as &quot;Spiritualistic&quot;(i.e. they are not atheist and believe in kind of<font color="#ff0000">
  </font>super natural force which is far away being Allah, God (Father of
  Jesus), etc of Quran, Bible. One such example is Albert Einstein, who once
  commented,</p>
  <font color="#ff0000">
  <p align="justify">&quot;I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes
  his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves.
  Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his
  physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such
  thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the
  awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world,
  together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so
  tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature.&quot;<br>
  [Albert Einstein, &quot;The World as I See It&quot;]</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&quot;A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually
  on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is
  necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by
  fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.&quot;<br>
  [Albert Einstein, &quot;Religion and Science&quot;, New York Times Magazine, 9
  November 1930]</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&quot;The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity
  of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by
  the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature. For him
  neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exist as an independent
  cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God
  interfering with the natural events could never be refuted, in the real sense,
  by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which
  scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot. But I am persuaded
  that such behavior on the part of the representatives of religion would not
  only be unworthy but also fatal. For a doctrine, which is able, to maintain
  itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its
  effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress.... If it is one
  of the goals of religions to liberate mankind as far as possible from the
  bondage of egocentric cravings, desires, and fears, scientific reasoning can
  aid religion in another sense. Although it is true that it is the goal of
  science to discover (the) rules, which permit the association and foretelling
  of facts, this is not its only aim. It also seeks to reduce the connections
  discovered to the smallest possible number of mutually independent conceptual
  elements. It is in this striving after the rational unification of the
  manifold that it encounters its greatest successes, even though it is
  precisely this attempt, which causes it to run the greatest risk of falling a
  prey to illusion. But whoever has undergone the intense experience of
  successful advances made in this domain, is moved by the profound reverence
  for the rationality made manifest in existence. By way of the understanding he
  achieves a far-reaching emancipation from the shackles of personal hopes and
  desires, and thereby attains that humble attitude of mind toward the grandeur
  of reason, incarnate in existence, and which, in its profoundest depths, is
  inaccessible to man. This attitude, however, appears to me to be religious in
  the highest sense of the word. And so it seems to me that science not only
  purifies the religious impulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism but also
  contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding of
  life.&quot;<br>
  [Albert Einstein, &quot;Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium&quot;,
  published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their
  Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941]</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  </font>
  <p align="justify">Therefore it is true that Einstein was not an atheist BUT
  no body can claim he was a Jews or Christian while defending the type of
  belief he had. Most of the scientists who believe in God today fall into above
  category. Their concept of God by no way supports the bizarre notion that Holy
  (?) scripture contains scientific facts.
