	life and legacy:</span></i></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">This talk 
	is in memory of Dr. Alimullah Khan – a great engineer, academic, scholar and 
	researcher, administrator, visionary, organizer and leader. Son of a high 
	school headmaster and born in Comilla in 1929, he graduated in mechanical 
	engineering from Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur in 1949 and received MS 
	in 1959 and PhD in 1963 - both from the University of Michigan, USA. He 
	started his teaching career as a lecturer in Ahsanullah Engineering College 
	(AEC) in 1950 and became professor of mechanical engineering at BUET in 
	1965.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In 1966 
	he left the teaching profession to become the first Project Manager of 
	Machine Tools Factory. He left government service in 1969 along with his 
	notable associates, Dr. F. U. Mahtab and Dr. Zahedul Alam, to start his own 
	consulting firm, “Prakaushali Sangshad Ltd”, which played critical roles in 
	various major projects in the early development of Bangladesh. After 
	liberation, he became the Chairman of the Steel Mills Corporation for a 
	short while, before returning to the stewardship of Prakaushali. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The 
	brilliant engineer passed away on June 11, 1984 in London at the age of 57.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">A life 
	Fellow of the Institute of Engineers, Bangladesh, he served IEB in various 
	significant roles, including being its Vice-President more than once and its 
	President in 1978. He was an influential and positive force as a senate 
	member of BUET and Jahangir Nagar University. Though fairly short, his 
	career – which included advanced training in UK and USA – spanned the whole 
	gamut: research, scholarship, teaching, engineering and technology 
	(particularly manufacturing and machine tool technology), business, 
	administration, and leadership roles in academia, in industry and in the 
	topmost national profession society. How can any one match his chequered 
	life and legacy? Few can aspire to achieve all this in multiple lifetimes.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">None who 
	has met Dr. Khan can ever forget him because of his incredible charm, 
	astuteness, sharp intellect, his uncompromising commitment to excellence, 
	absolute integrity, blunt honesty, and dominant personality. He was highly 
	moral, courageous, outspoken, always standing up against any unfairness. I 
	feel he should have been recognized by professorship at BUET sooner. He was 
	extremely hard-working, absolutely serious, and totally incorruptible: the 
	ultimate professionalism personified. His indefatigable devotion to truth, 
	excellence and decisiveness brought him in conflict with the reality time 
	and again. It was a matter of principle, apparently triggered by an unfair 
	interference from the ministry that caused his unanticipated departure from 
	the Steel Mills Corporation.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">He was 
	particularly notorious among the students, to whom he was universally known 
	as “The Field Marshall” (he was also called “The Royal Bengal Tiger” by some 
	students in awe of his commanding personality), not only because he served 
	as “The Marshal” at the Annual Sports Day, but also because students felt he 
	acted as one. It’s well known that his intimidating personality drove away 
	some students not only from mechanical engineering, but some from 
	engineering for good – surely a favour to the profession and to the students 
	who obviously lacked the commitment and tenacity to go through the rigour of 
	being trained as an engineer. He was unusually strict, always sticking to 
	his guns; he would set clear deadlines for projects,&nbsp; heavily penalizing, as 
	promised,&nbsp; any who dared to be tardy (students were too scared of him even 
	to think of it). Although at that time I felt such severity was unwarranted 
	and was a display of excessive authority and showmanship, I actually feel on 
	hindsight that he imbibed in us a clear sense of professionalism and respect 
	for timeliness and efficiency. We Bengalees indeed needed such a strict 
	disciplinarian as a task master. In reality, a mechanical engineer needs to 
	be precise: the factor of safety in aerospace and mechanical engineering is 
	much tighter than, say in civil engineering.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">All 
	students were terrified of ever confronting him as it was impossible to win 
	against him because of his sheer power of persuasion, or of approaching him 
	for any concession or leniency (students were usually more interested in 
	getting by less work than acquiring knowledge). He was merciless in adhering 
	to principles of straightforwardness and honesty and never minced his words, 
	saying the harshest things just the way they were with a smile on his face.&nbsp; 
	His infectious candour and fierce independence had an indelible impact on my 
	psyche. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I must 
	assert that if you are mentored by the likes of Dr. Alimullah Khan, Dr. V.G. 
	DeSa and Dr. M. H. Khan (this session’s chairman) and inculcate even a small 
	fraction of their rich attributes, which I have definitely attempted to, you 
	will do just fine. I can say with full confidence that few ever have the 
	privilege as we had of having these three dedicated teachers as role models; 
	those who didn’t have them would never know what they have missed. All three 
	had tremendous influence on me and my personality, and I am infinitely 
	indebted to them. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I will 
	give an anecdote. In my first year at AEC, he was as usual the Marshal on 
	the Annual Sports - a crowded, probably the most significant event on the 
	campus. As he was inspecting the athletic track boundary he noticed that a 
	student, struggling to have a clear view of the impending 100m run event, 
	stood with one foot within the rope bounding the track. I was the announcer 
	for the event and happened to follow the Marshal. He stopped, stared at the 
	student and commanded fairly loudly: “Will you remove your leg or shall I?” 
	The student of course meekly withdrew his leg and felt totally decimated, 
	left the field and apparently never set foot on the AEC campus again.&nbsp; His 
	stern style was a part of his agenda of teaching how to really stand up to 
	authority figures. At least that’s what I learned from him. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">He was 
	undoubtedly the toughest teacher in the history of the Ahsanullah 
	Engineering College and BUET. Although no student could know all the 
	teachers in the history of AEC and BUET, all who have ever taken a course 
	from him will believe that this is most likely true.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">He had a 
	penchant for cutting through the chase and get to the heart of the matter. 
	This he actually demonstrated consistently in all aspects. His deep 
	competence was reflected by the fact that he was equally comfortable with 
	concepts, theory, mathematical analysis, experimentation, laboratory 
	protocol and real-life engineering and technology. Although his main 
	strength was in Applied Mechanics, he was also highly savvy in manufacturing 
	processes, production engineering, materials and management – an incredible 
	blend. He was a champion of fundamental concepts; there was no chance that a 
	student weak in fundamentals would ever escape his immediate detection, let 
	alone pass his course. When asked by young colleagues (i.e., former 
	students), he admitted that he did indeed often ask questions whose answers 
	were unknown to him or he himself wasn’t sure what the answers were. He 
	wanted to examine how a student thought in problem-solving situations – the 
	real arena of engineering. I considered this to be the hallmark of a true 
	scholar: a probing mind without any fear of making mistakes, particularly in 
	front of students. He took all responsibilities with utmost seriousness and 
	did them with full vigour, without wavering.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Under the 
	veneer of being utterly tough and strict, he happened to be rather 
	understanding, particularly to the better students and when he was convinced 
	that the student was genuine and had a justified reason to default. He 
	introduced the honour code and would entrust the students with ethics. Once 
	he happened to have an important meeting come up in parallel with his 
	invigilating in an exam. He asked the students to write on top of the exam 
	script “I neither helped nor received any help in preparing the answers” and 
	then sign it. Students signed and he left the exam room entrusting the 
	students with the responsibility of not cheating; this was unheard of at 
	that time. Actually, no one tried to talk or cheat. They lived up to the 
	trust of the professor.&nbsp; Although students feared him intensely, he was a 
	pleasant conversationalist, having amiable relationship with friends and 
	family.&nbsp; He enjoyed literature (particularly reciting Tagore and Nazrul) and 
	photography.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><i>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">2. His influence on me:</span></i></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Dr. 
	Alimullah Khan had a profound impact on me personally.&nbsp; When I was a new 
	lecturer and taking his MSc course in parallel, I would often talk to him 
	seeking his wisdom. He actually encouraged it.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Then I 
	was able to get an offer to go to China for graduate studies and a Fulbright 
	scholarship to study in USA. In view of my having been a left-leaning 
	student leader (I must assert that I was never aligned with any political 
	party and openly advocated that students should not be pawns in the hands of 
	political leaders), it seemed obvious to me that&nbsp; I must go to China, and I 
	decided to do so. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Dr 
	Alimullah Khan summoned me and said with a smile: “I understand that you are 
	going to China for higher studies. If you want to learn more communism, that 
	is a good choice. But if you really want to learn science, I think you 
	should go to America.” I meekly withdrew from his office feeling flattered 
	that he cared (though he, like some others, thought that I was going to be a 
	communist leader), but felt a bit hurt as I took his unprovoked comment as a 
	rebuke and a direct challenge to my idealistic beliefs (it appeared that 
	many could not distinguish idealism from following some established 
	ideology).&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Because I 
	held him in very high esteem, I pondered over his comment for some time and 
	decided to explore the possibility of going to USA. I then got from him and 
	our prior principal, Dr. Waqar Ahmed, the addresses of their graduate 
	schools: Michigan and Stanford, and also three other schools (I don’t recall 
	which they were). It is now amazing to me that at that time I had no idea 
	about these schools or the concept of differing perceived qualities of 
	different schools. I would have tried Cambridge University or Imperial 
	College(of which I knew then, the latter being the graduate school of my 
	research advisor, Dr. V. G. DeSa) if I had any financial support to go 
	there. I was very desperate to go for higher studies as soon as possible and 
	was apprehensive about ever getting the chance to get a scholarship (I 
	wasn’t awarded a few others I applied for; among them was the highly coveted 
	Commonwealth scholarship).&nbsp; Time was slipping by. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><i>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">3. Going abroad:</span></i></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
	Stanford’s admission happened to come very quickly, perhaps because Dr. 
	Waqar Ahmed wrote a recommendation letter. Also, on guidance from Dr. DeSa, 
	I had developed a research focus on plasma dynamics in which Dr. Waqar Ahmed 
	and Dr. Alimullah Khan told me that Stanford had a major effort. I accepted 
	the offer promptly as there was no time to shop around, nor had I had a 
	reason to wait to weigh other possible admission offers as all of them 
	seemed at that time to be the same to me. I had no concept of program 
	rating. So, while my choice to go to America was influenced by Dr. Alimullah 
	Khan, my choice of Stanford as my graduate school was completely accidental. 
	I could have easily gone to a much lesser renowned school without knowing 
	any difference among the schools I happened to consider at that time. In the 
	middle of my research at Stanford, I became well aware of the fact that 
	magneto hydrodynamics (MHD) power generation - my area of MS research - was 
	a highly esoteric field even for USA and USSR, with virtually no possibility 
	of its being used in Pakistan. As I was determined to return to Pakistan 
	after my PhD and be of use to the country, I decided that I must change my 
	field to a relevant, classical field and then chose fluid dynamics, in 
	particular turbulence, as the topic of my research for PhD.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">When I 
	was giving the opening Lecture at the 2<sup>nd</sup> ACFM (Asian Congress of 
	Fluid Mechanics) in Beijing in 1983, I started with a dramatic statement, 
	“It’s an accident that&nbsp; I am not a Chinese but am an American”. The audience 
	was surprised and most didn’t believe that had I gone to China, I would have 
	stayed on there in search of greater scientific challenge as opposed to that 
	available in Bangladesh. Looking back, it’s clear that most probably I would 
	have done that. It seems that it was a good idea that I didn’t. I have to 
	credit Dr. Alimullah Khan for a very important piece of advice, which has 
	radically changed my life, even my identity.</span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p>

	the middle of nine children, supported by the meagre income of my father who 
	worked as a rice research assistant in the government agriculture 
	laboratory, I grew up in poverty. Father was stern and aloof. We talked to 
	him only when talked to. He had chronic asthma, which was the cause of our 
	extreme concern and panic during his frequent severe attacks. Mother was 
	very loving, but between her cooking, washing clothes, cleaning, and feeding 
	the different children at different times, we had to share her time with 
	beggars who also revered her as their adopted mother and would visit her 
	often and unload all their personal details and miseries; they came not to 
	beg but to spend some time with mother, to receive solace and sympathy from 
	her, which they got plenty. She would feed them whenever possible. I was 
	quite close to mother and was always amazed at how she remembered the names 
	and many details of even the relatives of numerous beggars. She had infinite 
	compassion and empathized with their problems. </span></p>

	could I afford to play badminton which most of my contemporaries played, nor 
	there was any time. I was taking care of our cows (source of milk for the 
	family) and growing vegetables in the spacious yards around the house 
	(watering them by lifting water from wells and carrying water&nbsp; to the plots 
	were very demanding); both were staples for the&nbsp; family. These chores would 
	take quite a few hours a day, often in the dark at night.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">For 
	financial reasons, I had to go to the cheapest schools, never knowing any 
	better anyway. The break came at the establishment of a new school with 
	modern building, Tejgaon Technical High School (now I think is called 
	Intermediate Technical College) to which ASM Quasem and I moved in 1954 from 
	Tejgaon High School at the start of Class 8. Quasem (I never understood why 
	he switched from English medium to Tejgaon High School) and I were competing 
	with each other not only there, but also subsequently at Dhaka College and 
	BUET in mechanical engineering. We have remained close friends all along and 
	since.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I was an 
	extremely shy boy, always being conscious that I was the youngest in the 
	class and never really having had much of a childhood, having been pushed 
	through double promotion twice and merely making the passing grade. Father 
	probably wanted us to work and have earning power as long as possible before 
	the mandatory retirement age. I had no skill in speaking, let alone in 
	English. Highly introverted as compared with my two older brothers who were 
	both excellent speakers and were active in all local cultural functions, my 
	total focus was to eke out a modest career to enable me to earn a 
	livelihood; the sole challenge was to find a way to survive with dignity.&nbsp; I 
	remember while standing in line as a boy scout in the High School, a 
	visiting dignitary asked if I wanted to be an engineer. I said: “Sir, I want 
	to be a technician.” I knew no better at that time. Soon after joining the 
	Technical High School, our popular but strict headmaster, Mr. Quazi Ambar 
	Ali, was retiring. The students selected me to speak at the farewell 
	ceremony, most probably because I was the top-ranked student in the senior 
	most class. I panicked but struggled to prepare a modest presentation. When 
	called, I went to the dais and struggled to say what I had planned but 
	froze: not a word came out of my mouth. With tears rolling down my cheeks, I 
	came down from the dais, feeling totally humiliated and shattered by letting 
	the students down. Mr. Ali knew that we all admired and appreciated him, but 
	I could not forgive myself. I vowed to overcome stage fright and never allow 
	myself to be embarrassed like that. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">While Mr. 
	Ali was the headmaster, I became a close disciple of Mr Razzaque – a 
	pleasant, friendly and suave young teacher. I remember feeling a sense of 
	devotion to all the teachers I adored, as if by osmosis I was going to 
	absorb their qualities. Strange on hindsight, this personality of emotional 
	attachment and trying to soak up wisdom from others seemed to have stayed 
	with me forever. When Mr. Razzaque went to England on training, he 
	maintained contact with me through letters. This had a very encouraging 
	effect on me. On his return, he became the headmaster. He was accessible and 
	had frequent interactions with me and other students. He subsequently became 
	the DPI of Bangladesh. During I.Sc. studies at Dhaka College, I was not 
	particularly visible, although I was in awe of Manzur and Maniruzzaman as 
	they were prolific in debating and literary activities. It was immediately 
	clear to me that they were headed to be political leaders.&nbsp; Among all 
	students in Arts, Science and Commerce at Dhaka College, the person getting 
	the highest marks was given a prize. Mizanur Rahman Shelly, the top student 
	in Arts and the topper in Matric, seemed unhappy when I was given the prize 
	as he felt that marks in science were higher than in arts. He had a valid 
	point. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
	year in Dhaka College, I joined UOTC (University Officers’ Training Corps); 
	I was already a corporal when I joined AEC where UOTC was compulsory for the 
	first year students (an admirable move by Dr. Rashid); as all students start 
	at the cadet level, I was automatically one of the commanders and eventually 
	rose up to RSM, the second highest rank! I applied to the Pakistan Army for 
	being commissioned as an army officer, but was rejected after I went to 
	Rawalpindi for the final interview. Although I took it hard at that time (I 
	was apparently declined for being short), as this was the first unambiguous 
	rejection that clearly stared into my face; yet this is one failure that was 
	truly good for me, as subsequent events proved that military would be too 
	much discipline for me to adopt. I should have known better as Capt. Haleem 
	Chowdhury, Commander of UOTC, had some difficulty earlier in putting me in 
	line when I openly complained about food at the camp. He was a true 
	gentleman, and I feel sorry that I indeed overreacted in an imprudent 
	manner. I just seemed to have a tendency to stand up to authority and 
	challenge any perceived autocracy.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
	Misfortune seemed to follow me often. In High School, I prepared meticulous 
	notes postponing preparation for the last moment, as procrastination seemed 
	to be the rule rather than exception with me, as it is even today! Just ten 
	days before the Matric exam, there was a burglary in my house. Only thing 
	stolen were my notes and only from my room. It was too late to recompile the 
	notes and I had thought seriously of dropping out, but then took a chance. I 
	fell severely ill during my I.Sc exams and had to take the exam in sick bed. 
	I was ranked first in Matric (Tech) and third in I.Sc finals. I gained some 
	confidence that I had probably genuine merit. I actually never felt that I 
	was more capable than others.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">My career 
	and subsequent evolution were a result of a sequence of accidental choices 
	and not at all a result of careful planning; I think this is the case with 
	most people. I first got admitted into Economics at Dhaka University 
	(somehow I was fascinated by the role of economics in planning and nation 
	building, hoping also to compete in the Civil Service after graduation; that 
	seemed to be the way to go then) and then finding out that the first rank 
	holder in ISc, Nripendra Nath Chakravarty, went to physics, I chose to 
	switch to physics, as if I must prove to myself if I was truly any less! (I 
	tried for tripos but was told that this very difficult route of simultaneous 
	Honours in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics had been discontinued for many 
	years. Looking back, it was strange that I tried for tripos as Chemistry was 
	my Achilles’ heel; I had a very hard time memorizing those formulas and had 
	a very low score in Chemistry in ISc; that chemistry had some logic wasn’t 
	apparent to me then.) Soon Nripendra left for Germany for higher studies in 
	physics. I found out that all the remaining top students interested in 
	science went to engineering. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I felt I 
	will face more competition (as it appeared that I thrived on 
	competitiveness! And I would go nowhere without any serious competition. 
	Little did I know then that the only person I must compete with is myself) 
	in engineering and so there’s where I must go, and then I joined AEC. My 
	roll number was high, 225 in a total of 240 (courtesy JRC) in the first 
	semester in AEC because I joined late. By the strange hierarchical system my 
	roll number from second semester till graduation was 1. Once you get no.1, 
	it seemed to be an obsession that you must remain no.1. This can be severely 
	unhealthy. But I didn’t know any better. I always envied Jamil as he was an 
	all-rounder, surrounded by a large number of very good friends who were also 
	quite well off (perhaps nothing unusual for the BD scene). I didn’t have the 
	class or the affluence to belong to this “in-crowd” club. It turned out that 
	I didn’t have the time to spend in this elite, highly social group, which 
	also spent significant time together playing ping pong, badminton, tennis, 
	billiards and a lot of camaraderie. I have since been accepted by this great 
	group and I indeed appreciate their friendship.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">UOTC 
	helped me in two ways. It forced me to do the almost-absent physical 
	exercise and gave me some much-needed endurance and stamina (I was always 
	feeble and sickly, getting cold very easily). Engineers need it sorely (not 
	only for the arduous projects, drawings and reports as a student, but also 
	on the job). I think this emphasis by Dr. Rashid was very good, although 
	most students – intellectual and lazy alike – hated it. UOTC was very good 
	for me personally as the role of being sergeant major helped me to come out 
	of my shell and introverted ness. My humiliating experience of trying to say 
	a few words in public at the farewell of our headmaster in high school 
	loomed very prominent in my mind. I became determined to change myself so 
	that I could speak. Simultaneously, I was having pangs of rebellion against 
	Dr. Rashid’s tyranny; it appeared that he was running AEC with iron hand, 
	totally intolerant of any one having another opinion. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Anyway, 
	the point is – which I often mention to my students even these days – that 
	you can do whatever you decide to do. My eagerness to overcome my shyness 
	and to stand up for student rights and champion their cause seemed to be my 
	calling.&nbsp; The shy boy was shy no more. I became the Editor of the BUET’s 
	Students’ Central Union in my 2nd Year(1961), General Secretary in the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
	Year(1962) and Vice-President in the 4<sup>th</sup> Year(1963)(VC was the 
	President). There was an outburst of extra-curricular activities (clearly 
	unreasonably too much, indicating an excessive obsession). The conflict with 
	Dr. Rashid heated up so much that it was affecting the senior teachers. The 
	entire cabinet of the Students’ Central Union, except me as the GS, resigned 
	soon after election. I refused and carried on with all the responsibilities 
	of the Union the whole year. The sustained conflict, purely on matters of 
	principle, took a heavy toll on my health; I was a broken man physically, 
	but not mentally. I was simultaneously carrying my work as a Varsity 
	Correspondent (for the years 1960-63) of the Pakistan Observer (Mizanur 
	Rahman Shelly was the other Correspondent), both reporting to Mintoo Bhai (Enayetullah 
	Khan)), which was my only source of income (paid one anna per line of news 
	written by me). </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">So I 
	declared in 1962 that I did my share and much more already, and I wouldn’t 
	run for the position of VP of the Central Union. I didn’t run, as promised. 
	Md Anis, who had won the position of Joint Secretary the previous year, won 
	the GS position, but no one filed for the VP position. This was strange as 
	these were turbulent years and the consciousness of the BUET students were 
	heightened at that time. There was never a dearth of candidates wanting to 
	be the VP, the head of the student body. I was told that after my record as 
	GS, none felt that he (no female student at EPUET yet) could match it. I 
	wasn’t impressed. After a few days, Prof Kabiruddin, Chair of the Students’ 
	Union summoned me to tell me that I was chosen VP by acclamation and that I 
	must accept it. I declined it and requested him to call for VP election 
	again. He did, but none filed again.&nbsp; I ran out of excuses. That’s how I 
	became VP. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">My 
	additional, concurrent activities involved being President of the Literary 
	and Debating Society and President of the Student Chapter of the Institute 
	of engineers, Pakistan (IEP). I participated in the BUET annual drama (I 
	chose the role of not the hero as I was determined to further shatter the 
	“goodboy” image and took the role of a naughty man, heroine’s 
	brother-in-law) which seemed to receive wide appreciation. It was indeed a 
	good drama, and I had fun doing it. I won the Governor’s Challenge Cup at 
	the 1963 Inter-University Debating Championship (I happened to draw the 
	OPPOSE side of the topic “Third World War is Inevitable”). I concluded that 
	I must have presented a convincing rebuttal, as I was nowhere near as good a 
	speaker as the others. I also won the first prize at the 1963 Speakers’ 
	forum on Science organized by the Pakistan Association for the Advancement 
	of Scientists and Scientific Professions, where I drew the topic: “Energy 
	Resources and Energy Problems of Pakistan”. This showed that I was able to 
	become a reasonable speaker, an achievement beyond my own expectations. It 
	proved to me that you can be whatever you want to be: self-engineering.

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">There 
	were many conflicts between me (mostly as the student leader) and Dr. M. A. 
	Rashid, the renowned principal of AEC and then the first Vice-Chancellor of 
	the East Pakistan University of Engineering &amp; Technology (later BUET). Much 
	has been said and much has been speculated about this conflict. I think this 
	is a good forum where I must state the facts as I know and try to set the 
	record straight. The circumstances behind the apparent and open conflicts 
	were not known to others. As I have been maligned by some un-informed, so 
	was Dr. Rashid on some matters as well. I will surely give him credit 
	wherever it’s due. Some engineers told me over the years that mainstream 
	politics entered AEC during my student leadership. This is misinformation as 
	I helped bring in more national awareness among AEC students, but was myself 
	a staunch opponent of national party activities entering AEC campus, and 
	openly criticized the use of students as pawns in the hands of political 
	leaders.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">For years 
	Dr. Rashid, the Principal, ran AEC (Ahsanullah Engineering College) with 
	absolute authority and ran all aspects of the place with an iron hand. He 
	was actually popular with the Education ministry for maintaining strict 
	discipline and for fiscal conservatism (apparently returning money because 
	he felt some expenses were unnecessary). Few teachers, let alone students, 
	had any say. Students and junior teachers feared him and would say little in 
	his presence. Senior teachers either surrendered to his unquestioned power 
	or kept quiet about their not seeing eye to eye with him. It was common 
	knowledge that he didn’t have complete acquiescence from Mr. Rashid, a Civil 
	Engr. Prof. and surely not from Prof Najmul Haq. The three ME professors I 
	mentioned and Prof Mohsin Ahmed, all of mechanical engineering and Prof 
	Waqar Ahmad of electrical engineering were the giants, who seemed to 
	maintain peaceful co-existence with Dr. Rashid.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On my 
	arrival at AEC, I found Dr. Rashid’s style overly controlling, unduly 
	repressive, and like that of a village chieftain, often petty. AEC was a 
	small place, and our paths would often cross (it’s also possible that I 
	gravitated to the centres of power or “the source”). The students were 
	treated poorly, shepherded like sheep, and expected to act like minions. I 
	wondered: why should the best brains of the country be treated like slaves? 
	Treating engineering students like little kids wasn’t the way to train them 
	as future leaders (that was at least my goal for going to AEC). Though 
	rather young, I felt this must be stifling creativity. Without creativity we 
	will be just technicians, which I didn’t want to be any more. I became 
	rather resentful of the teachers, but found that all roads led to him. They 
	mostly followed what he told them to do. They either knew nothing better or 
	didn’t think it was their place to do so.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">It’s 
	surprising that in a very short time after I started at AEC, I happened to 
	have a few run-ins with Dr. Rashid, which progressively convinced me that he 
	developed a strong dislike for me. I will recount a few incidents that I 
	remember.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b><i>
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">9.</span></i></b><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In the 
	first year, my room (along with five others: Khalil, Mamoon, Maudood, Anis 
	and Towhid) happened to be precisely the current VC’s office in the old main 
	hostel. In the large number of community latrines, there was no water when 
	flushed.&nbsp; Complaints at the hostel office made no difference. I felt this 
	was a big problem that needed to be brought to the attention of the “boss”. 
	I went to see the principal; Dr. Rashid cordially consented to let me into 
	his chamber. After hearing my anxious complain, he said: “Hyder Azam, your 
	superintendent, should be able to fix them; he’s a sanitary engineer.” I 
	felt it was an arrogant dismissal of my serious request, and on top of it, a 
	serious put down of our friendly super. Those days, super didn’t look after 
	these details. When I meekly protested that professor shouldn’t be fixing 
	latrines, he said: “what’s wrong with that? He needs the practice”. Dr 
	Rashid did indeed order them repaired some time later (as nothing moved 
	without his approval), but his tyrannical response left a bad taste in my 
	mouth. I was stunned by what appeared to me to be his derogatory treatment 
	of another teacher in his absence, knowing well of course that he wouldn’t 
	hesitate to say the same thing in his presence. I left with a clear sense 
	that maintaining order was more important to him, irrespective of whether 
	the students are suffering or not. I have often seen him eager to teach the 
	teachers, whether students were around or not. It’s now clear to me that he 
	actually felt that teaching the teachers (often it was teaching them a 
	lesson) was his job.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Being 
	somewhat disorganized, I was neither efficient, nor punctual, sometimes 
	being late (except in the class of Prof Jabber, who would inevitably 
	decimate a student if he showed up even a few seconds late. It just didn’t 
	appeal to me to be such an essential part of pursuit of knowledge or of 
	excellence. I always wondered why he put so much emphasis on that. Perhaps 
	the concepts were more important.) One day, I was coming to a class a bit 
	late. Dr. Rashid happened to be patrolling the corridors (I always felt at 
	such moments that the jail guard was making the rounds to check that the 
	prisoners were behaving). Seeing me rushing to class and recognizing me, he 
	yelled at me to stop, summoned me, and asked who was the teacher of the 
	class that I was supposed to be in and which room the class was in. He 
	rushed to the room (I sheepishly followed the dictator) and motioned the 
	teacher to come out to see him. Dr. Rashid told him with his characteristic 
	reprimanding look and tone that he mustn’t be teaching well or anything 
	useful, otherwise this boy wouldn’t be wandering around outside. I protested 
	that it wasn’t sir’s fault, but by that time the subject of his wrath was 
	the teacher, not me. It seemed he was waiting for an occasion to give some 
	lesson to this particular teacher.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">There was 
	another interaction in which Dr. Rashid was indeed justifiably irritated 
	with me. In my third semester, I happened to get excited about the 
	recently-invented Wankel engine. I was so excited that I wanted to 
	immediately jump into a project of building an engine at EPUET and develop 
	the concept further. I realized that it would demand a lot of resources: 
	some materials and mostly labour (which we had plenty of). Dr. Rashid seemed 
	surprised as he hadn’t yet known about my usual habit of thinking out of the 
	box. He told me that he wondered if I had enough background to undertake 
	this sizeable project. I said that if he supported it, I would get into 
	details and learn all that’s necessary. I have no doubt that I would have. I 
	pushed harder, he resisted harder. I wasn’t at all convinced that he did the 
	right thing. I was highly disappointed by his rejection, but was grateful to 
	him for listening to me. I feel I would have done something significant with 
	it.</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Something 
	happened that gave me an early view into the psyche of Dr. R.&nbsp; Not much 
	after I joined AEC, we had the brilliant, impressive, youthful, incredibly 
	charming, recently promoted full-professor of physics at the Imperial 
	College,&nbsp; Abdus Salam, come and visit as a Special Speaker. Totally 
	uninvited, I got highly motivated to interact with him and interjected 
	myself into the host group. We were happy to have two perfect gentlemen as 
	our leaders: LK Siddiqui (VP of the Students’ Central Union) and Ahmedul 
	Ameen (the General Secretary). I talked with them and offered to help with 
	Prof Salam’s visit, which they welcomed; we all got busy converting the 
	large drawing room upstairs into a make-shift auditorium; in the process we 
	chatted and agreed that Prof Salam would be requested to speak on something 
	like: “some possible technological implications of his breakthrough research 
	and also his personal experiences in his journey as a physics researcher”. I 
	think he came prepared to talk on that. Prof Salam, Dr. Rashid and Mr 
	Siddiqui sat on the dais. Dr R took the microphone, mumbled his 
	unnecessarily modest welcome (I expected a much more gracious and glowing 
	greetings), but then stunned us all by asking Prof Salam to speak 
	specifically on: “the daily life of a student at Imperial College”. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I was 
	aghast by the insipid greetings (the greater the man, the more polite he’s 
	supposed to be, I had known) and by this arbitrary imposition of such a 
	mundane, meaningless topic. As I quickly suspected, Salam appeared caught by 
	surprise and grudgingly struggled through some unfulfilling comments about 
	what a student might be doing each day. Is that a topic for Salam to talk 
	on? I asked. I distinctly recall being both ashamed and embarrassed. “That 
	says we’re a bunch of technicians”, I said it to myself. Is this why we were 
	so excited about Salam’s visit?&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">What did 
	we get out of it? What did he? I had the distinct feeling that he felt, as I 
	did, that it was a wasted time for him. We were excited about his visit for 
	no reason: he was asked to say nothing and he politely complied. It is 
	possible others have a different take on it. At best I can attribute Dr. 
	Rashid’s behaviour as jealousy. But I felt Dr. Rashid’s blatant jealousy was 
	unwarranted as he never came across to me to be a brilliant thinker 
	(although he had a sharp memory in selected matters), let alone being a 
	scientific brain even remotely of the calibre of Abdus Salam. This is what I 
	thought then; I haven’t found any reason to change my mind.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Preceding 
	and during Salam’s visit, I felt Dr. R was not sufficiently deferential to 
	Salam and actually seemed quite resentful of the tremendous outpouring of 
	adulation exuding from the students for Salam. It should now be clear that 
	Salam did indeed deserve such high regard, and students should be given 
	credit for having had the right values flocking around and mobbing him. I 
	felt proud that we knew how to honour our own. I did wonder: should these 
	brilliant students be turned into minions or morons through endless hours of 
	hard labour in survey fields, machine shops, and carpentry and foundry 
	shops? During the thousands of hours of drawing projects (in mechanical and 
	civil engineering projects), spending many sleepless nights, I often 
	struggled to understand what was the point.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">After the 
	new university was announced, there were two important events that decidedly 
	soured him on me. At the installation ceremony of me as the new General 
	Secretary (the largest indoor event on campus attended by faculty and 
	students) of AEC’s Students” Central Union, just immediately after the 
	announcement of EPUET, I asserted at the assembly that University of 
	Engineering &amp; Technology was not a good name. and that it should be 
	University of Science &amp; Engineering or Science &amp; Technology, as science must 
	be at the core of&nbsp; this new university. There can be no good engineering or 
	technology without mathematics and physics. (I emphasized this privately to 
	Dr. Rashid earlier, and I repeated this twice in open lectures.). He viewed 
	that to be beyond student comprehension and thought it was impudent on my 
	part to talk on that matter. I disagreed with him then and also now. He took 
	this uninvited </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
	assertion</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
	as a criticism as he was involved in the National Committee to recommend the 
	formation of the two universities of engineering and technology.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The 
	second event concerned my job as the Varsity Correspondent of Pakistan 
	Observer, the major English daily at that time. I was very proud to have 
	been already a student of this new university of science and technology and 
	wrote a big article profiling its Vice-chancellor along with a large picture 
	of him. I obtained bio-data from reliable sources and was happy with the 
	article. Dr. Rashid summoned me. When I appeared, he seemed quite upset 
	although I was sure I did a good job. He told me that I should be studying 
	rather than wasting time writing such articles. He insisted on knowing who 
	provided the facts on him. I told him that as a reporter that was my secret. 
	He then got louder and asked who told me that he got MS in 1947 and PhD the 
	next year. I actually hadn’t noticed this striking information, but now 
	quickly realized that this was his closely guarded secret (totally unknown 
	to me). I told him if there was any factual inaccuracy, the paper will 
	surely publish a corrigendum. He remained angry as I withdrew. It stuck in 
	my mind that there must be some question about his PhD. I never pursued the 
	matter although I have heard comments about “wartime quick PhD” and also the 
	opposite: his was a DSc, much higher than a PhD. The latter wasn’t at all 
	true. We always tend to exaggerate to feel good but seldom judge the depth 
	or get experts’ confidential evaluations. His contributions in East Pakistan 
	engineering education was significant, but only experts in civil engineering 
	can objectively judge his citations and the true depth of his contributions. 
	We should probably do so and give him his due. If his contributions were 
	notable, we should say so.</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">My high 
	school headmaster, Mr. Ambar Ali, was somewhat strict, but nowhere near as 
	much. Mr Razzaque was like an older brother, he was endearing, and caring; 
	he played badminton with students. At Dhaka College it was total freedom: 
	large mass of students taking very large classes from a few teachers who 
	were on campus mostly to meet classes; they were like western professors, 
	totally detached from any involvement with any student, who can do whatever 
	he/she wants. As a result each left the other alone. At AEC, I found a 
	problem: we’re pawns in the hands of a control freak, who seemed less 
	interested in educating and promoting thinking and more in regimenting and 
	controlling. This is the beginning of my problems with Dr. Rashid: a 
	conflict in style not in goal. I was OK with it, he wasn’t. He took my push 
	for more student rights and reasonable flexibility as a direct challenge to 
	his rule and authority, which had remained intact for years and he wasn’t 
	about to give in. Hence started a series of confrontations. The more he 
	wanted me to disappear the more I was pushing for reasonable rights and 
	privileges for students.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Just 
	after my election as GS, once police came and cordoned the new hostel and 
	arrested about 200 students. They were detained in a police compound across 
	town. In view of my various almost endless meetings with student leaders 
	from Dhaka University and Medical College, I happened to be not in the 
	hostel at the time of police invasion and was thus not arrested. When I 
	heard of the arrest, I was very upset, particularly because they were being 
	held overnight in the compound. At about 2 am, in the dark of the night, I 
	came to the Vice-Chancellor’s house and rang the bell. He opened the door, 
	with a startling surprise on his face. I wasn’t invited in, but I requested 
	to just step inside the door so that police or anyone looking wouldn’t find 
	out that he was talking with me. I appealed to him to have sympathy for the 
	students and get them released. I was convinced that he could get them 
	released if he wanted. It seemed he was bent on teaching the students a 
	lesson for their then rowdy behaviour. He said with a straight face, ”young 
	man, they came for you and arrested them instead because you slipped away. 
	You should go and surrender.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">All the 
	students will be released immediately once they catch the real culprit.” His 
	cold response pained me althoughit didn’t surprise me. I didn’t see any 
	connection between the police raid and me, and didn’t believe they would 
	have released the students. I was not sure I will be alive if caught by the 
	military. I didn’t go the police as there was no warrant.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I was 
	getting very unhappy about the poor facilities: classroom, laboratories, 
	hostels, living conditions of the students, too few toilets in the dorms to 
	accommodate that many students during short breaks between endless lectures 
	and sessional classes, unsanitary kitchens, waterlogged passage between 
	dorms, no sanitary canteens, emphasis on just busy work and not thinking. I 
	felt this wasn’t really what engineering education should be. How to bring 
	some semblance of scholarship, thinking, and reasoning?&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I decided

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The word 
	somehow reached Dr. Rashid (nothing ever happened on campus that he didn’t 
	know as he made it his busiuness to know all details) who challenged me, 
	saying that I have no business contacting the Governor. I politely said that 
	I did so only as the elected leader of the students as he was the formal 
	head of the institution. He said that as Vice-Chancellor he should have been 
	informed (I didn’t say that if he was informed, he would surely not allow 
	it, and the students would never get to tell him of their grievances). I 
	told him that yes, as the VC he has the right to call the Chancellor and 
	tell him not to come and cancel the visit. He understood that I was ready to 
	call his bluff.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Dr. 
	Rashid, instead, got very busy getting the big drawing hall that was under 
	construction to be ready as we didn’t have an auditorium, finishing 
	plastering, whitewashing, installing ample lights, fans, etc. His keeping 
	construction costs low by returning money to government was catching up with 
	him. There were frantic works going on round the clock so that this boss of 
	his, well known for spotting incompetence and inefficiency, doesn’t find any 
	fault with this great academic leader. I really took pity on Dr. R. as he 
	seemed extremely nervous, less by the fact that the student leader upstaged 
	him by bringing the Chancellor to the campus which he himself had failed to 
	achieve ever, but more by the fact that someone having an authority over him 
	will, for the first time judge him first hand. I do not think Azam Khan had 
	any plan to change EPUET stewardship, but Dr Rashid’s response suggested 
	that he may have felt that his job was at stake. Or may be this lad with 
	deep political connections is manoeuvring to get someone to take his job. I 
	had nothing of the sort in my mind. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I must 
	say that Dr. Rashid refrained from punishing me severely (including 
	rustication) as he was wrongly convinced that I had close ties with Maulana 
	Bhasani (who I never met), Hamidul Haq Choudhury (I happened to meet him at 
	times as a worker at Pakistan Observer, which he owned; he never discussed 
	politics with me; he knew me only as a good student) and some others. I did 
	have some contact with Mr Mujib, initiated by him. Student leaders were 
	often invited to meet with him, less often invite by the other leaders. It 
	was mutually beneficial as most student leaders had political aspirations. I 
	didn’t have. I wouldn’t go, but would catch up with the gist from Enayetur 
	Rahman from DUCSU and Ahemd Zaman from Medical College Students’ Union. Once 
	I did meet with the Bangabandhu. Seeing me, he thundered, but with a smile, 
	“You have become a Laat Shaheb, don’t come when called”. I said with a firm 
	but surrendering tone, “Sir you’re in national politics, concerned with the 
	whole country. I am elected by the students to air their grievances to the 
	authorities. I have nothing to do with you.” He probably took offence but 
	clearly understood that this boy wasn’t like other student leaders (later). 
	He left me alone since then. But Dr Rashid’s misfounded belief that I had 
	deep connections with the mighty (he must have thought, why else is this boy 
	so arrogant with him? Challenging his authority all the time?) worked 
	actually as a blessing for me: it may have actually helped me as I was 
	neither rusticated nor my scholarship cancelled (my only subsistence other 
	than my income at Pak Observer, was actually held back for a year, causing 
	me severe financial hardship).&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">An hour 
	before the Governor’s late afternoon visit, Dr. Rashid came to the Hall 
	where I was busy organizing the chairs for the audience, setting up the 
	lectern, testing the microphone, etc. When I greeted him, he said, “Why two 
	chairs on the dais? Where will I seat?” He understood I was planning to seat 
	with the governor. I said: “Sir, you will seat on that special chair in the 
	front row. This is a student event, although you are definitely invited.” He 
	then asked his assistant to put the third chair on the stage, in line with 
	the other two. I told him that I had discussed with the governor’s military 
	secretary the seating arrangement, and then put his chair back at the front 
	of the audience seating in the big hall. After receiving Azam Khan 
	downstairs, Dr. Rashid. was standing next to me and also greeted the 
	governor, when I brought him to the hall, I was stunned to find that again 
	there were three chairs. Dr. Rashid quickly escorted the governor to&nbsp; the 
	dais and made him sit on the middle chair, he himself&nbsp; sat on one side, 
	leaving the other chair next to the lectern for me. I quickly enquired as to 
	who put the third chair. I learned that while I was waiting downstairs for 
	the governor’s arrival, Dr. R himself climbed the dais with the heavy chair 
	in his hands and he himself reset the chairs, before he came down to join me 
	in receiving the governor. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I felt 
	Dr. R was interfering in my serious effort to substantially improve the 
	inhuman living conditions on the AEC campus and to uplift student morale, as 
	they deserved better. I recalled vividly how my and other students’ 
	enthusiasm on an earlier occasion was hijacked by Dr. R., who successfully 
	ruined the student exuberance for Prof Salam, and turned his visit into a 
	non-event. So I came on full gear, perhaps overreacting. I was aware that 
	virtually all faculties (seated in the front) and most students and staff 
	were there, struggling to be within the big room to be able to hear the 
	governor. It was a packed house.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I gave a 
	long speech, outlining the hardship of students on EPUET campus, the 
	extremely poor academic and living facilities on campus, extremely 
	insufficient toilet facilities even in the New Hostel (the latest, where 
	there were often long lines of students waiting to use toilets; somehow I 
	was offended by that scenario: short break but long lines of people standing 
	in line with badnas in hand. The daily scene. How much more humiliating can 
	life be?) In my speech I became somewhat insolent in making it clear that 
	this hostel was designed by the country’s prominent civil engineer, Dr 
	Rashid himself. Almost an open warfare, as if to settle the score, to fight 
	back for all the humiliation and torture that the students were facing, 
	hoping that only such unpleasant words were needed to stop the torment. I 
	think Dr. Rashid had tears, not from caring for the students, but from the 
	“insult” in front of the boss. I was sad then, sorry later. I was indeed 
	torn between standing up for the students’ right versus being courteous to 
	Dr. Rashid. I wanted to do both, but found it impossible.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In the 
	same speech, I mentioned that scholarships had been held back for about a 
	year by the VC, causing undue hardship for the students. I also mentioned 
	that during the arrest of the students in the New Hostel some articles were 
	found missing from the student rooms. I emphasized the importance of 
	engineers in the building of the young nation and that engineering students 
	deserved a cafeteria, an auditorium, much better facilities, classrooms, 
	laboratories, seminar rooms, etc. Then I invited the Chancellor to visit the 
	dorms.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Dr. 
	Rashid was neither invited to speak by me (I felt justified because most 
	grievances were really about him) nor did he make an effort to do so. He 
	seemed highly shattered by my attack. Also, he was intimidated by Azam 
	Khan’s personality and was hoping that Azam Khan would ask him to respond or 
	speak. He didn’t, presumably not to embarrass Dr Rashid any more. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In his 
	speech, the Chancellor accepted all the demands. In particular, he ordered 
	the VC to release all the scholarships immediately (actually done). He also 
	ordered that some hostel rooms be converted to toilets (done within a few 
	months, now unnecessarily too many toilets!). He promised to refund all 
	demands of missing articles (I did receive a large cheque from him at the 
	Governor’s House; the picture was published in the Pakistan Observer with a 
	sensational caption: ” Engineering varsity general secretary,Fazle Hussain, 
	receiving from Governor Azam Khan a cheque of Rs 10,000 to replace articles 
	stolen by police during raid of&nbsp; university hostel.”&nbsp; In my excitement while 
	I was writing the caption as the Varsity Correspondent late at night, I got 
	carried away. Clearly “stolen” was a unjustified defamation. I should have 
	known better. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The 
	sub-editor in charge of checking the caption trusted me and didn’t get to 
	check at the last moment. The editor, Abdus Salam, and the news editor,&nbsp; A.B. 
	M. Musa, summoned me in to the editor’s office; both told with a very sad 
	face that the caption I slipped in would severely cost the newspaper. Musa 
	bhai then looked at me and with a stern face told me that the sub-editor and 
	I were fired. I understood the great harm I did and left with a great sense 
	of shame . Of course, after three months I was summoned by Musa bhai who 
	reinsted me. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">He then 
	went with me (the VC and many students following) to inspect the Plassey 
	hostel (tin sheds with brick walls). As it was after a regular rainfall with 
	some drizzling going on, there was water. Azam Khan had to walk over a plank 
	to go from one the hostel to the dining hall. He told me that he did not 
	fully believe me when I spoke earlier, but thought the situation was 
	actually worse. He told me the country needed good engineers, but with good

	felt victorious. Dr Rashid took it very hard. He found his unquestioned 
	authority and his firm grip on the entire campus slowly fade. He held me 
	totally responsible and could never forgive me. The facilities on BUET 
	campus were poorer than on the DU campus, they were much poorer before. I do

	crowd. I never did, either in front of him or in his absence. That is just 
	not my style. Whatever I had to say, I always said face to face, as I truly 
	convinced myself to be almost totally fearless about him. I had many 
	disagreements with him. I was always polite in telling him that I disagreed 
	and explained why, and also explained that I was merely doing my duties as 
	the elected student leader. It seemed he felt&nbsp; I was out to get him, so 
	offense was his best defence; hence he was out to get me. It was clearly 
	unfair as he had too much advantage over me.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">He meant

	years as he delegated this duty to other professors. He himself sat on the 
	committees for all scholarships I could apply. The Committees for Fulbright 
	and the Chinese (Mao Tsetung?) Scholarships had not invited any member from 
	the Engr. Univ. That’s why I probably got them. After struggling for a year, 
	I was able to get Dr. DeSa to convince him to accept me as a lecturer, 
	particularly because I was already carrying the full load of the MSc 
	program, and all of them were lecturers. I was given the rank “Acting 
	Lecturer (Temporarily Against Deputation)” at the lowest salary; that is,&nbsp; I 
	could be terminated instantly at any time. I swallowed my pride and accepted

	absolute wall and silence. A few days later, message came from VC that this 
	decision was final, nonnegotiable. Three semesters of serious hard work (all 
	students had a full-time job, some outside EPUET) gone down the drain! We 
	felt absolutely disenfranchised; the rug has been pulled from under our 
	feet. We all went to Prof Zahiruddin, who told us what happened; it was 
	clear that he wasn’t supposed to tell us, but he himself seemed to be both 
	disheartened and embarrassed. He didn’t&nbsp; seem to care any more about the 
	reprimand he would receive if Dr. Rashid knew he told us.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">This is 
	what he told us. As he was walking back from the exam hall to his flat that 
	evening, he ran into Dr Rashid who inquired why he was not in his math exam 
	(Dr Rashid thrived on remembering such details and took pride in feeling 
	that he’s really in charge). After hearing the straightforward explanation 
	of why he decided to postpone the exam by 48 hours, he asked Prof Zahiruddin 
	if Fazle Hussain was in this exam also. Dr Rashid turned furious when he was 
	told “yes”. He rebuked the professor for allowing himself to be manipulated 
	by this boy and told him that he will not tolerate this lawlessness in this 
	university and only the VC had the power to postpone any exam. He wrote the 
	program suspension decree that same evening and ordered it posted all over 
	the campus. It’s strange that in the request to Prof Zahiruddin, I didn’t 
	open my mouth (although I also felt that we had insufficient time to prepare 
	and should put in the effort to digest the material in the two extra days; 
	after all that will help the whole purpose: to learn the subject), nor did I 
	have any role in the spontaneous discussion on the possibility of postponing 
	the exam. All the students were flabbergasted by this totally unwarranted 
	and irrational executive action, based on an imagined scenario and obsession 
	of Dr. Rashid. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">After 
	many pleadings and begging for forgiveness (although we committed no offence 
	or mistake) over a number of days, presumably by some teachers also, we were 
	told that Dr Rashid might reconsider if we would go to Dr. Alimullah Khan 
	and apologize. We all immediately went to his flat on campus. He seemed 
	touched and forcefully reminded us that he and other teachers put in extra 
	time to teach the graduate courses as they wanted to help us, and we should 
	not find ways to bypass exams. We didn’t argue and unconditionally 
	apologized profusely for hurting his feelings as we meant nothing against 
	the teachers. He forgave us and wished us good luck with a smile. I had to 
	imagine what he was told by Dr. Rashid. I breathed a great sigh of relief, 
	hoping that I will now go to USA with my MS degree. After the rescheduled 
	Math II exam, I got very busy putting final touches to my MS thesis. </span>

	a few papers in a top journal. I was highly apprehensive of Dr. Rashid’s

	wedding with the invitation card in hand. He was a long-time friend of my

	marrying. Suddenly the wedding was cancelled next ady, as somehow he 
	convinced my&nbsp; would be father-in-law that he was going to have a lot of 
	problems with me. Finally, Rehana was adamant and stood up to her father, 
	the rest of the family supporting strongly. The wedding was reinstated after 
	a few days of turmoil; there was a long lead time, fortunately. I felt I 
	will get nowhere&nbsp; in East Pakistan with Dr. Rashid being angry at me, and 
	there was no question of getting a job in West Pakistan. I was always afraid 
	of the military as I was previously being hunted by the military during my 
	student ;leadership days (1960-63). I was tipped off by an intelligence 
	officer in 1963 that “I would be shot on suight” because of my strong 
	opposition to Ayub Khan’s military rule. I was told that the military would 
	justify that saying that I was involved in clandestine operation to 
	overthrow the government. For a long while, I was in disguise, at times 
	sporting a long beard, making sure I moved veery 2-3 hours., once in

	could possibly find. I was lucky to meet Professor LSG Kovasznay of the 
	Johns Hopkins University who managed to get me a low-paid job: Visiting 
	Asst. Professor, doing teaching and post-doctoral research. I was actually 
	thrilled to get even this chance, primarily for research.. At that time jobs 
	in aerospace engineering were very hard to find all over USA because of 
	massive layoffs at Boeing and other aerospace enterprises , in anticipation 
	of&nbsp; US decision of shutdown of the supersonic plane (SST) project; it was a 
	wise move by USA, unclear at that time, causing a lot of turmoil for the 
	numerous, unemployed high-tech engineers, but the eventual Concorde fate 
	proved the point. I then quickly applied for a change of visa. Legally, 
	Fulbright scholars cannot stay. I was given a political asylum, particularly 
	because of the military rule in Pakistan. I hadn’t planned to stay back in 
	USA. I have to say: mainly because of Dr. Rashid, I felt forced to saty in 
	USA. This is how East Pakistan lost a young, ambitious engineer-scientist.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Do we 
	really need the Civil Service? This is what I used to ask myself when I was 
	a student. Legacy of the British Raj, and created as an elite buffer between 
	the ruler and the ruled which was definitely unavoidable under the 
	circumstances and at that time, this massive (also growing) bureaucracy may 
	indeed have outlived its value and its effectiveness. We should ask if in 
	balance it is really helping the country or if it is actually hindering the 
	evolution of Bangladesh as a nation.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The 
	natural question to ask : Do we need such a relatively gigantic military? 
	Yet still, Do we really need a military? Providing international 
	peacekeepers cannot be the mission of any country’s military. If attacked by 
	India (who else?), can we stop them? What can we do with a submarine, with a 
	few jet fighters or a few tanks? Are they there for consolation, for ego 
	gratification? At what cost? What is the share of defence in the national 
	budget? Does that have to be a secret? Surely we neither want to be a 
	superpower nor a nuclear power. India will be both and there is nothing we 
	can do about that. We must accept that and adjust to live with that. What 
	other choice? I wonder whether we can get by without any military and can do 
	with only police and rifles. Highly professional police will also help in 
	all spheres of nation building, including homeland security, law-and-order, 
	corruption, traffic control, etc. and is a worthwhile investment. I think we 
	should consider entering into a peace treaty with India and maintain a joint 
	border force under a joint border Commission. If that doesn’t make us feel 
	secure, we can have agreements with China and United States to watch and 
	protect our interest. I don’t think that should hurt our pride.&nbsp;</span></p>

	SOUTHEAST ASIA (USSEA). Perhaps consisting of the current countries like 
	Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, Bangladesh, Myanmar Srilanka and India 
	(divided into a few) as the constituent states, it will have a common 
	military, common currency, a central parliament (consisting of upper and

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
	Corruption is innate to human society, unfortunately. We seem to have a bit 
	too much of it in this land. I am tired of seeing BD’s sustained but sorry 
	distinction as the ‘most corrupt nation in the world.’ I feel offended when 
	I see this written or mentioned as all my friends are unquestionably honest 
	and of impeccable integrity. (It isn’t a matter of ego that I must say I 
	choose only honest people as my friends; they are actually honest) How is it 
	possible that out of hundreds of Bangladeshis I know, I know of absolutely 
	no one who is corrupt, yet it is a thoroughly corrupt country? I do not

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">We need 
	to stop corruption and nepotism at the top first; I have no doubt that it 
	will trickle down the line to the lowest level. People throw their hands up 
	in the air in total despair: “it’s impossible”. I emphatically disagree. Our 
	people are basically honest and sincere. The circumstances encourage them to 
	find shortcuts. They need role models and examples. Regulations and 
	restrictions are definitely not the solution. Although formulated with 
	sincerity and good intentions, precisely the same rules and regulations 
	breed further corruption. They are the instruments of corruption, 
	particularly at the lower levels. I strongly believe that simpler the 
	procedures and softer the restrictions, the less will be corruption. Some 
	abuse will be there and cannot be controlled by rules, nor by religion, but 
	only by leadership and cultivation of values.&nbsp;</span></p>

	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I feel we

	should be the highest paid public servant (say, 10 lakh taka per month in 
	today’s value), next ministers (say, 7 lakh takas), national professors 
	(say, 3 lakh), agency heads and top scientists (say, 2 lakh), then 
	professors, technocrats, bureaucrats, etc. The quality of public service 
	(not to be confused with Civil Service) will improve if salaries are brought 
	in line with the private sector. Most jobs should be on contract basis at a 
	competitive salary. This is bound to create some insecurity, precisely what 
	keeps people productive and competitive. That is not bad.&nbsp;</span></p>

	Actually the people sitting in this room. I could be accused of not being 
	objective. I think I’m being objective. I do not believe bureaucrats and 
	politicians can or will be able to lead or bring about the change that this 
	country desperately needs. I think only engineers can bring about a real 
	change in this society through technological growth. But how? Engineers in 
	Bangladesh are notorious for being corrupt. My information is that with the 
	exception of a few, most are indeed corrupt. They exploit their expertise 
	for extortion, quite often slowing down projects, instead of facilitating 
	them. In fact, engineers may indeed be the most corrupt professional group 
	in this country. It is a shame. No strict training or religious education 
	will change this, but only cultivation of values can. Fear of punishment or 
	of hell has not decreased corruption; I am told corruption among engineers 
	has been progressively increasing! This is one area which IEB should have 
	been able to not only clearly address and even found a realistic cure for 
	it. IEB,this is your biggest assignment. I am pleased to note that there is 
	significant IEB activity in promoting retraining of technical manpower. In 
	these days of rapidly changing technologies and globalization, engineers 
	need to keep up-to-date with retraining in new areas and IEB seems to be 
	doing a good job. </span><b><i>

	universities of science and technology). Most teaching loads will involve 
	graduate (MS and PhD) courses and supervision of post-doctoral research. 
	BUET should openly adopt the philosophy: “Professors are paid to think, not

	pros and cons of different versions of proposed bills in the parliaments, 
	analyzing the implications of final legislations, tracking the progress of
