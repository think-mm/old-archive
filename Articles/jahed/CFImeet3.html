  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">As I like to say these 
  days- usage of the word “rise” about “militant Islam” is already on rise. And 
  now it is high time that we abandon amateurish intellectual discussions and be 
  serious about finding a solution. It seemed to me- all our honorable and 
  distinguished keynote speakers were well aware of this fact during last 28<sup>th</sup> 
  August, 2004’s Monthly Meetings for Humanists of Bangladesh and other South 
  Asian origin. The topic- literally speaking- was <b><span style="color: red">
  “Exponential Rise of Islamic fundamentalism in </span></b></span><b>
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: red">Bangladesh 
  and Other South Asian Countries:</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
  <i><span style="color: blue">In Search of a Solution</span></i><span style="color: blue">”</span>.</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"> 
  The event was fully supported and generously sponsored by <b>Center for Free 
  Inquiry Metro New York</b> (<a href="http://www.cfimetrony.org/" style="color: #000066; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">www.cfimetrony.org</a>). 
  And It was arranged jointly by CFI metro NY and <b><i>Mukto-Mona</i></b> (<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/" style="color: #000066; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">www.mukto-mona.com</a>). 
  The session was chaired by Dr. Austin Dacey, a published author and editor of
  <b><i>Philo</i></b>, a magazine on natural philosophy, of CFI. Ms Susan 
  Jacoby, the executive director, a former journalist of <b><i>Washington Post</i></b> 
  but now a freelance journalist and author of recently released NYT acclaimed 
  book<b> “Freethinker: A History of American Secularism”</b>, couldn’t make it 
  herself to the event; however, she sent a strong message expressing her 
  profound condolence on unfortunate demise of Dr. Azad and solidarity with what 
  she thinks “all of our causes”. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"><b>If any good thing 
  recent unfortunate demise of Prof. Dr. Humayun Azad –beyond doubt an 
  incalculable loss- and increase of grenade attacks on opposition political 
  rallies, progressive organizations’ gatherings, and assaults on 
  journalists/secular intellectuals in Bangladesh has done at all: it is the 
  need for unity of all secular minded people/organizations. Repeatedly this has 
  been echoed by almost all keynote speakers. </b>Another unique aspect of last 
  28 August’s gathering was that we were fortunate to have many bright and 
  esteemed secular thinkers of Bengali origin assembled at one place. Not ever 
  since we started, in the history of CFI metro NY sponsored Bengali and South 
  Asian humanists’ group discussions, did it happen before!&nbsp; The guests were 
  received by Dr. Dacey at 11.00 am and after a coffee break the session started 
  with a moment of silence for one minute, as a token of grievance, to the death 
  of Dr. Humayun Azad and all those died in recent grenade attacks on opposition 
  party rally. Moderator then requested Dr. Dacey to explain CFI and its 
  mission. Following this, the speech session began.&nbsp; </span></p>

  (<b>Moderator’s note:</b> Many of us are writers. Some are human rights 
  activists too. However, what makes Kabir unique is his firm determination and 
  exemplary courage in the face of so many known risk factors to raise voice 
  against and report mass attacks on minority Hindu community and opposition 
  political party leaders/activists in the aftermath of October, 2001, general 
  election by political activists, leaders of radical <i>Jamayet-e-Islami</i> 
  and BNP. Reaching out victims in many remote areas of Bangladesh; recording, 
  interviewing them was not a piece of cake. And Kabir did it like a brave 
  soldier. He is a pioneer in secular journalism in BD, acting President of “<b>Committee 
  for Resisting War Criminals and Collaborators of 1971 liberation war of BD”,
  </b>South Asian Representative of<b> Holland-based Institute of Social Study 
  and a writer of several books. </b>A brave freedom fighter himself; Kabir lost 
  two of his first cousins in 1971- prominent journalist martyr Shahidullah 
  Kaisar and noted writer-cum-film maker Joheer Raihan. He was imprisoned for 
  two months by Khaleda-Nizami regime.<b> Amnesty International </b>called him<b>
  <i>‘Prisoner of Conscience’</i> </b>and he is an equally familiar face among<b>

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"><b>“Their agenda is an

  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Bangladesh which has 
  been harboring secular heritage for hundreds of years into a theocratic 
  state.”</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"> It is 
  hard to argue with Shahriar Kabir when he points out: <b>“long before they 
  came to power; Islamic fundamentalists openly declared in streets, <i>‘We 
  shall be Taleban, Bangla will be Afghan.’”</i></b><i> <b>
  <span style="color: red">“</span></b></i><b><span style="color: red">In 
  Bangladesh, today the connotation of the word ‘minority’ is not confined to 
  any one particular religious sect; to the contrary, it means both religious 
  and ethnic sects such as Hindu, Quadiyani and all secular 
  writers/intellectuals and even non-partisan journalists.”</span></b> Citing 
  examples Shahriar Kabir shows- how lately the four party alliance based 
  government (mis)guided by Jamayaet-e-Islami is taking its revenge of defeat 
  during 1971 by turning Bangladesh toward their ‘dream state’ Pakistan. <b>
  “Consider recent rise of killings of Ahmedia community and capture of all 
  their mosques in the country; consider government’s ban on their books, 
  publications. And if this continues, I’m sure- soon government would declare 
  Ahmedias as ‘non-Muslim’ just like the way their counter part did in 
  Pakistan.”</b></span></p>

  “Jamayat’s hand is very long. Even in USA, they are active. Taking advantage 
  of identity crisis of 2<sup>nd</sup> generations of Bangladesh, Jamayat is

  He cited from his own experience: TATARSTAN, a republic under Russian 
  Federation- in his words- only secular Muslim country in the world. In 
  Tatarstan-&nbsp;&nbsp; S. Kabir says, ” Muslims and Christians are living amid amity and 
  peace for about a thousand years. They have been fighting <i>Wahhabism</i> for 
  last 155 years. Wahhabism, the Saudi based chauvinistic version of Islam, 
  didn’t find its way and Kabir presented a magnificent DVD in support of his 
  statement at the end on Tatarstan. </span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">In 1971 
  Bangladesh was born as a secular state. <b>Two remarkable aspects of 1972 
  constitution were a) secularism and b) ban on political use of religion.</b> 
  Unfortunately during 1976, through 5<sup>th</sup> amendment both these aspects 
  were deleted, paving the way for fundamentalist political parties to use 
  religion as a political tool. What is even worse- later regime instilled “<i>Bismillahir 
  Rahmanir Rahim”</i> into the constitution and through 8<sup>th</sup> 
  amendment- Islam was declared a state religion; thus burying the secular 
  nature of 1972 constitution.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black">Initially 
  religious reactionary forces had no support. However-with a gap of 33 years- 
  those who once either fled the country, or lied dormant, are now the partners 
  of the government in power. </span><b>
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: red">If their 
  agenda is let to succeed; it’s not only minorities such as Hindu, Ahmedia, 
  Christians, Buddhists <i>et al</i>, but also all the secularists and 
  freethinkers of Muslim origin will become second class citizen (in a<i> sharia</i> 
  based country). Ascendancy of mullahs is not only a threat for Bangladesh and 
  South Asia, but for whole world. e.g. link between 9/11 in USA and Talibans
