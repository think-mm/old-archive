    <p>I've been under severe and multiple attacks from some readers after
    commenting on animal sacrifice during &quot;EID-UL-AJHA&quot;. I sent that
    to NFB at first without any title. Later I mailed title but probably it was
    too late for NFB to change. However, I don't think title would have changed
    those reader's mindset. Nevertheless, let me mention title I decided was <b>&quot;EID-UL-AJHA
    and Sacrifice: Let's do it other way!</b>&quot; I know my suggestion/writing
    or even a better and more rationalistic suggestion from somebody else would
    not alter those minds that harbor beliefs/trends more because they’ve
    inherited it rather than whether it can be justified truly or not. Besides,
    according to many such readers/friends, I’m merely a human being (even
    though I exist) AND therefore I, under no circumstances, am allowed to
    question <b><i>Quran/Hadeeth/Mohammed/Geeta/Bible</i></b> etc irrespective
    of how rationalistic/constructive it is.</p>
    <p>However, after reading all those criticisms and reactions INTERESTINGLY I
    didn't feel bad at all as my understanding is that prejudices/beliefs are
    the product of conditioning. In fact, it just reminded me how similar I
    myself was even few years back!!! So I looked at myself.</p>
    <p>Yes, my dear readers, I understand how you felt after reading my comments
    on EID DAY because it’s not been very long when I was also just like one
    of you in terms of religious beliefs and therefore was very sensitive to any
    criticism directed against Islam and its tradition.</p>

    yourself as to whether at least some of it I really share(d) with you or

      <p>Therefore, Islam promotes fanaticism/terrorism. It’s the their
      consciences that make some people (those moderate in nature and want a

      <p><span style="COLOR: maroon"><font face="Comic Sans MS">6. Quran can
      NEVER be explained scientifically IF its meaning is taken literally.
      However it’s understood that it was composed hundred years back and was
      compiled even many years later after the death of Mohammed.<O:P>

      posses’ capacity to predict each and every thing as things can't take
      place on earth without his consent THEN isn’t it incredible/funny to
      believe that He made poor Israfil to stand millions of years in advance
      with &quot;singa&quot; in hand?? Also Quran says, anything if Allah wants
      to take place or wishes to shape all He needs to say, &quot;Be!&quot;

      <p><span style="COLOR: maroon"><font face="Comic Sans MS">8. I’m tempted
      to quote two famous thinkers in order to present my present view:<O:P>
      </font></O:P>
      </span></p>
      <p><b><font color="#ff0000">a) &quot;Question with boldness even the
      existence of God; because if there be one, He must approve the homage of
      Reason rather than that of blindfolded Fear.&quot; <O:P>
      </O:P>

      <p><b><font color="#000000">----Thomas Jefferson<O:P>
      </O:P>
      </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font color="#ff0000">b) &quot;I cannot imagine a God who rewards
      and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after
      our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty.
      Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body,
      although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous
      egotism.&quot;<O:P>

      <p><b><font color="#000000">-- Albert Einstein<O:P>

      </font></b></p>
      <p><span style="COLOR: maroon">&nbsp;<font face="Comic Sans MS">9. Human's
      love/feelings towards his GOD should not be so superficial that it has to
      be expressed in such a form that looks/sounds more like buffoonery rather
      than cordial respect/reverence that comes from within. Then Meat for
      poor?? Why not cash money if we really care?? Does it make sense to give
      him money when he doesn't have spices at home or may be money is what he
      needs more at that moment than meat (say, his son is sick).<O:P>

      saying woman is inferior to man or man is the protector/maintainer of

      that woman were made out of left chest bone of man.<O:P>

      <p><span style="COLOR: maroon"><font face="Comic Sans MS">13.Prophet
      Mohammed was a human being, may be highly intelligent, BUT there is no
      reason to believe that the universal truth &quot;To err is human&quot; was

      favors winner. Had HITLAR won World War II, Would we have known about the

    <p>I’ll conclude here with a small request to readers. After you’ve read
    my essay and thought honestly for sometime, If you think you share at least
    some of my past thoughts if not the present one, then please don’t harbor
    any grudge/hatred against me FOR I’m very similar to you all and you
    don’t know for sure, you may share more things in coming days as well!!</p>
    <p>But if you find that you neither share any of my past thoughts nor, you
    think that my present view is logical THEN I apologize for my lack of
    understanding!! Otherwise? No I don't seek apology from anybody RATHER I
    entreat following:</p>
    <p><b><font color="#ff0000">Let's be led by ourselves!! Just ourselves!! You
    need not even need to read books/articles written by people like me i.e.
    disbelievers. Let’s just read <i>Quran/Hadeeth/Bible/Geeta/Monu Songhita</i>
    and examine them with rationalistic mind at least to make sure we’re
    neither being hypnotized, nor being hijacked emotionally! <O:P>
