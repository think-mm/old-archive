										(hereafter, BSNY), said to be the 
										‘largest organization of expatriate 
										Bangladeshis’ in New York, lately has 
										been heavily fined by&nbsp; New York City for 
										not having cleared and taken care of the 
										dirt and debris in a Public School which 
										they rented a few days ago during the 
										weekend, to hold an election. The news 
										appeared when newly elected 
										representatives were still busy in 
										showing their big appearances along with 
										congratulatory messages through paid ads 
										in local Bangla weeklies published in 
										New York . The City, as a part of 
										punishment, has also decided not to rent 
										any of its schools to BSNY for at least 
										a year. The decision is likely to affect 
										other Bangladeshi organizations as well, 
										if we have to look at the past record. 
										For the same ill record—leaving a venue 
										dirty and full of debris once an event 
										is over— the City already stopped 
										renting Public Schools to Bangladeshi 
										organizations in Jackson Heights and 
										surrounding areas. It should be noted- a 
										Public School to hold any 
										meeting/community event is preferred 
										mainly because, they are cheap, spacious 
										and easy to locate for the people. The 
										grandiose election of BSNY took place 
										not in Jackson Heights but in Astoria 
										for the reasons just mentioned. Now with 
										a fine and restriction on BSNY, it would 
										be probably unlikely that same Public 
										School authority would agree to rent the 
										venue to other Bangladeshi 
										organizations. Hence, my friend made the 
										above comment.</span></div>

										One thing that most Bangladeshis did not 
										forget to bring along to USA from their 
										home country is politics and grouping. 
										For instance, in New York , there are 
										individual associations/organizations 
										for Bangladeshi people of every 
										district, Thana , sometimes even at 
										Union Parishad level. What do they do? 
										Well, those of us living here are well 
										aware of their activities by virtue of 
										about a dozen of Bangla weeklies 
										published from New York alone. The 
										headlines that most of these 
										organizations make in community 
										newspapers are quite amusing. They hold 
										elections with mega sized paid ads in 
										newspapers (frankly speaking, sometimes 
										American congressional district 
										elections do not make as much uproar as 
										these elections do).&nbsp;Post election time, 
										newspapers are flooded with greeting and 
										congratulatory messages to the winners 
										from the so called well-wishers and 
										friends leaving some readers with the 
										question: Is earning dollars in US so 
										much fun for these ‘friends and well 
										wishers’ to pay for such ad?&nbsp; The tale 
										does not end here, rather, begins 
										occasionally. Often, there would be 
										accusations, counter-accusations by the 
										participants in post-election period 
										which occasionally end up with freestyle 
										fights between the winner and the loser, 
										and, of course, their supporters. If 
										unresolved for a while, the conflicts 
										and fights are taken to&nbsp;US courts.

										How does Bangladeshi national politics 
										affect&nbsp;expatriate Bangladeshis living in 
										the USA ? Well, expatriate Bangladeshis 
										not only carry out native-styled 
										political activities, they do it in full 
										rhythm and in a unique way. For 
										instance, all major political parties in 
										Bangladesh have their offshoots in the 
										USA ; not only just one, but many even 
										within the same borough. Let me 
										illustrate. Queens is one of the five 
										boroughs in New York City . Jamaica &nbsp;and 
										Jackson Heights are two neighborhoods 
										within Queens . By virtue of 
										their&nbsp;inherent&nbsp;qualities, expatriate 
										Bangladeshis have such political 
										organizations as BNP /Awamileague(AL)/Jatiya 
										Party(JP)/JASAD Jamaica Br.(s).Thus each 
										of these parties has several 
										sub-branches within the same Queens 
										borough. Readers may guess about rest of 
										the boroughs. It should be mentioned, 
										Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh , apparently 
										being more shrewd than its counter 
										parts, carry out activities under the 
										name “Muslim Ummah of North America”. 
										Again, <i>what do these AL/BNP/JP 
										leaders and activists do?</i> Mostly 
										their activities are restricted to 
										celebrating party and party <i>leaders’</i> 
										birth anniversaries, greeting central 
										party <i>leaders</i> at airports (JFK/Laguardia) 
										whenever their Excellencies, the central 
										AL/BNP/JP <i>leaders</i>, visit USA and 
										taking part in photo-sessions at 
										airports with the central <i>leader(s)</i> 
										flanked by the local <i>leaders</i> with 
										flower bouquet in hand. Thanks to Bangla 
										weeklies in New York for not depriving 
										us of our due! Looking at these leaders’ 
										amusing activities, sometimes an analogy 
										comes into my mind. The numbers of the 
										expatriate Indian community in New York 
										&nbsp;are many times higher and many of them 
										came to US long before we did. Yet can 
										anyone imagine hearing of organizations 
										such as BJP Manhattan Br. /Congress 
										Jamaica Br. Or the like? Of course, 
										there are organizations among expatriate 
										Indians in USA but they, by no way, 
										represent any factions and political 
										divisions among&nbsp;Indians living here. Why 
										is the same not true of us, the 
										expatriate Bangladeshis?&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div>

										That briefly gives some idea about what 
										preoccupies the productive (!) minds of 
										many of our countrymen in New York . 
										There is no reason to think that, 
										outside New York , the situation is any 
										better (a few weeks ago, more than one 
										FOBANA congregation was held within the 
										same Atlanta city of Georgia , USA ). 
										What is uniquely pathetic is, wherever 
										Bangladeshis have stepped in, not even 
										religious institutions are free of 
										narrow politics. In Astoria , New York , 
										across the same street, are located two 
										mosques named Shahjalal Mosque and 
										Gausia Mosque, built and maintained by 
										the local Bangladeshi community. 
										Initially it was the Gausia mosque that 
										later split up,&nbsp;creating another mosque.
