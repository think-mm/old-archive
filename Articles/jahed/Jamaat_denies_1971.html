&nbsp;-Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Pulitzer Prize winner American historian &amp;

font-family:Verdana">n the context of the current controversy surrounding some 
	noted anti-liberation and 1971 war collaborators’ statements denying the 
	occurrence of genocide and terming ’71 war merely a ‘civil war’, instead of 
	‘liberation war’ as it is known to the people of Bangladesh and the rest of 
	the world, historian Arthur Schlesinger's above saying points out at least 
	one important character of our nation: we forget our heroes but forgive our 
	proven enemies. We have miserably failed to deal with and decide on an issue 
	that largely defines our country’s birth, history and glory. Needless to 
	say, the statements made by the Jamaat Secretary General Ali Ahsan Mujahidi, 
	Jamaat sympathizer Shah Abdul Hannan and Jamaat leader Qader Mullah are 
	false and outrageous; yet I think we cannot get away from our own 
	responsibilities simply by showing our outburst at them. They said it 
	because we, collectively, may have helped them arrive at a stage where they 
	think they do not, or need not remember their anti-liberation role in 1971; 
	they see themselves more as the legitimate leaders of an Islamic political 
	party which exerts significant influence in the political arena of 
	Bangladesh. And that did not happen overnight. Years of opportunistic, 
	unpatriotic and power hungry political trends—common among the main stream 
	political parties including the one that led our liberation war—have raised 
	their level of confidence. Or else, how many nations do we know of where the 
	documented war criminals dared to deny the very country’s sovereignty and 
	birth as early as 36 years after its independence? To the contrary, we know, 
	even 62 years after the World War II, collaborators and sympathizers of 
	Nazis are still being prosecuted and brought to justice in many European 
	countries. A few months ago, a man as eminent German Nobel Laureate author
	</span><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
	Günter Grass drew acrid criticism—some even demanded the Nobel Laureate 
	title be withdrawn from him—after he confessed his involvement with the 
	Waffen S.S.—an organization known to have committed many war crimes during 
	WW II. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I see a lot 
	of protests and reactions coming out from the people of Bangladesh: 
	intellectuals; freedom fighters; politicians; secular, cultural &amp; 
	progressive organizations and beyond. This is a good sign that shows, our 
	nation still has not forgotten its greatest heroes and their sacrifice for 
	liberation and however factionalized and divided otherwise we might be, we 
	would not let anyone go unchallenged if the legitimacy of this nation’s 
	birth and sacrifice is doubted. Yet I have some concerns whether ultimately 
	we would be able to initiate trials of war criminals and collaborators. I 
	think so not because we have any lack of proof, documents or witnesses as to 
	who those people were that cooperated with the Pak army in killing several 
	hundreds of thousands of freedom fighters, or who formed Al-Badr, Al-Shams 
	etc killer forces; my concern, rather, lies elsewhere. I am afraid, as a 
	nation with long history of dementia, these outbursts and protests may soon 
	turn out to be just a whim or someday the issue might lose priority in our 
	minds. It is also not impossible, political opportunism would instead go in 
	favor of those whom we are trying to put on trial, as it has happened in the 
	past. But I truly hope, my fears do not come true. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The current 
	interim government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed has taken quite a few essential 
	and bold steps (although I have reservations about certain actions of his 
	government) that were long due and given their past history, most probably 
	would not have been taken if any main stream political party ascended to 
	power. For example, separation of judiciary from the executive branch; 
	prosecuting corrupt political leaders regardless of their personal status 
	and ranks. <b>M</b><span style="color:black"><b>ay I request His Excellency 
	the Chief Adviser of the caretaker government that his government take&nbsp; 
	initiatives to start trials of 1971 war criminals and collaborators?</b> <b>
	If Mijahidi-Hannan–Qader Mullah gang could show impudence of denying our 
	liberation war when several thousands of freedom fighters, political 
	leaders, organizers, sector commanders, and &nbsp;other direct and indirect 
	victims in the hand of Pak army and their appointed local agents in 1971 are 
	still alive, what might happen when some day we would lose these people from 
	us? Do we wish to leave behind a history of our nation’s birth with a 
	question mark for our present and future generations?</b> We must find 
	answers to these questions. Let us also not forget, Bangladesh was not 
	liberated for becoming a platform for any opportunistic person, political 
	party or organization which deceives people in the name of religion. If 
	history is to be taken into account, the use of religion in politics has 
	always had deleterious effect on people and society. Hence the use of 
	religion is banned in any civilized society. It is not a question of East or 
	West. It is for our own sake, and to facilitate ways to a pluralistic, 
	democratic and progressive Bangladesh that we need to ban all political use 
	of religion, be it Islam or any other kind. We do not want our motherland 
	getting transformed into another Afghanistan, Pakistan or Nigeria. Of 
	course, those who did not recognize this country’s liberation and have no 
	faith in its sovereignty would always try otherwise. <br>
	<br>
	</span>I was born in 1972 in independent Bangladesh. All my knowledge about 
	1971 is based on secondary information and sources: books, tale from 
	eyewitnesses and the media. But in the independent Bangladesh I saw, to what 
	extent Jamaat-Shibir could become dishonest, hypocrite and immoral in order 
	to grab power. For years, they have been deceiving and exploiting the 
	religiosity of this country’s people in the name of Islam. I vividly 
	remember the wall writing of Jamaat during elections in Bangladesh: “Vote 
	dile pallay, Khushi hobe Allay” (Cast your vote on Scale Symbol and Allah 
	shall be happy). As if Jamaat-e-Islami was the authorized sole agent of 
	Islam and Allah in Bangladesh! Therefore, I need not be any more convinced 
	than I am already as to what &quot;ideals&quot; (!) Jamaat-Shibir really stand for and 
	what role they played in 1971. To the contrary, I do not have even a shred 
	of doubt about the courage, devotion and patriotism of several millions of 
	men and women who sacrificed their lives for our independence (that the 
	exact figure, whether 3 million or less, is hardly an issue to me). However, 
	I am yet to be convinced that our leaders, politicians really care about 
	this country and its people. If they do, I am sure they will unite, work 
	collectively and take steps to ensure- no one in the future would dare to 
	raise question about the legitimacy of our liberation war. In this 
	direction, identifying our enemies is just as important as our heroes.
