	excellent scientists and enthusiastic personnel of comparative 
	endocrinology. First of all, I should clarify the purpose of comparative 
	endocrinology. Comparative endocrinology is responsible to promote the 
	scientific understanding of interdisciplinary knowledge in the fields of 
	Biology and Medicine concerned with the morphological and functional aspects 
	of endocrine physiology in order to facilitate improvement of the quality of

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">On 
	Feb 7, Professor Charas Suwanwela, the Chairman of the University Council, 
	Chulalongkorn University, Thailand emphasized on the role of biological 
	scientists to discover the secret of our life during his presidential speech 
	at the opening session. He added that the contributions of the scientists 
	are very significant to progress the knowledge. Therefore, those who are 
	working for biological science also have a great responsibility to continue 
	the advancement of knowledge about living being. The AOSCE 2006 symposium 
	was held in honor and commemoration of the late Professor Puttipongse 
	Varavudhi, who was among the early founding members of the AOSCE from 
	Thailand. In the first day of the symposium, therefore, Varavudhi memorial 
	lecture was organized to remember late Professor Puttipongse Varavudhi by 
	one and all participants. During this session emeritus Professor Susumu 
	Ishii of Waseda University, Japan, Professor John Y. L. YU of Academic 
	Sinica, Taiwan and Professor Jean M. P. Joss of Macquarie University, 
	Australia delivered their excellent lectures. Prof. Ishii let the audience 
	know that he had a promise to develop the knowledge on comparative 
	endocrinology with Prof. Varavudhi long time ago. Accordingly, they worked 
	with fruitful collaboration and stimulated each other via personal and 
	conference communication. They also published a significant number of papers 
	in the top graded international journals. Professor Issii highlighted the 
	importance of comparative endocrinology to conserve the species. Prof. John 
	Yu delivered his speech on evolution of pituitary gonadotropins in 
	vertebrates. He predicted that since the evolution is still continuing, 
	therefore, the physiology of living being and even creature as a whole in 
	this world would possibly be changed in future. Prof. Jean Joss presented a 
	talk on endocrinology and evolution of lungfish. She showed precisely that 
	soft anatomy of living lungfish shares many similarities with that of living 
	amphibians. After the Varavudhi memorial lectures, &nbsp;a group photo of the 
	AOSCE conference participants was taken (see the photograph). In the 
	evening, there was a &nbsp;welcome reception where plenty of delicious Thai 
	dishes were served and a video show was displayed exclusively about 
	Thailand. Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, founded as a Thai capital 
	in 1782 by the first monarch of the present Chakri Dynastry, is among Asias 
	most cosmopolitan cities. At present, it is a national treasure house and 
	Thailands spiritual, cultural, commercial, academic, and diplomatic center.

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Next 
	day, Professor S. Bhattacharya of&nbsp; Visva-Bharati Univ., India presented a 
	plenary lecture on molecular mechanism in the regulation of oocyte 
	maturation. He strongly suggested that cell division is the basis of 
	biology. He showed in detail how a different regulatory mechanism exists in 
	perch fish oocyte maturation. Scientific symposia were held followed by the 
	plenary lecture. Professor Y. Koch of Weizmann Institute of Science, 
	Rehovot, Israel, delivered a lecture on tissue specific regulation of 
	Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) under the session Reproducton, Growth 
	and Development. GnRH is produced in the brain of all vertebrates, 
	including human of course, and regulates the secretion of pituitary hormones 
	which are essential for reproductive functions. It was interesting to note 
	that circadian pattern exists for the expression of GnRH receptors. 
	Professor K. Kubokawa from University of Tokyo, Japan delivered a nice talk 
	on evolution form invertebrates to vertebrates.<span style="color:red">
	</span>Two sessions of scientific symposia ran simultaneously in two 
	different rooms in the same floor of the symposium venue. After the lunch 
	break, Professor J. F. Cockrem of Massey University, New Zealand, offered a 
	plenary lecture on stress endocrinology and behavior in Antarctic penguins. 
	Prof. Cockrem showed how Antarctic penguins might respond to physical and 
	emotional stress. Prof. Cockrem stated that stress was a condition to adopt 
	our physiology with the environment. The poster session was held during 
	2:15-4:45 PM, where many excellent posters were presented by the 
	participants from the countries of Asia and Oceania. I also presented a 
	poster entitled Melatonin action on the induction of 
	gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone in the avian brain. I have the plan to 
	write about my research works for the learned readers of MM sometimes later. 
	The poster session was the last academic session on Feb 8. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">On 
	Feb 9, Professor A. Urano of Hokkaido University offered a plenary lecture 
	on expression of hormonal genes in the neuroendocrine system of salmon fish. 
	Prof. Uranos findings indicated the importance of GnRH neurons as the 
	initiator of major neuroendocrine events during salmonid spawning migration. 
	After that a scientific symposia sessions on Reproduction, Growth and 
	Development and Molecular Endocrinology and Gene Expression were held. 
	Professor H. B. Kwon of Chonnam National University, Korea explained the 
	novel mechanism for ligand-receptor interaction and signal transduction of 
	mammalian and nonmammalian GnRHs stimulated by either GnRH-I or GnRH-II. 
	Prof. Kwon was optimistic that his research findings would be beneficial for 
	the development of therapeutic drugs against central and reproductive 
	disorders. In the afternoon, Professor Visut Baimai of Mahidol University, 
	Thailand delivered his plenary lecture on biodiversity and conservation in 
	Thailand. Professor Baimai nicely clarified the idea of biodiversity and 
	showed how this biodiversity had long been essential for human survival in 
	terms of food, medicine, clothing and housing. The last scientific symposium 
	on Frontiers in Reproductive Neuroscience was held followed by the plenary 
	lecture. Professor I. Parhar of Nippon Medical School, Japan was the first 
	speaker of this session. Prof. Parhar described his novel single cell 
	technique. By this technique his team discovered the G-protein coupled 
	receptors in individual GnRH neurons and endocrine cells of the pituitary of 
	tilapia. Their cloned novel nonmammalian G-protein coupled receptor (GPR54) 
	stimulates GnRH secretion and is crucial for pubertal maturation. Associate 
	Professor H. Ando of Kyushu University, Japan, then presented about 
	molecular mechanisms of GnRH action in masu salmon pituitary cells. Prof. 
	Ando adequately presented how the reproductive stages relate to GnRH action. 
	Dr. T. Ikemoto, Dr.&nbsp; K. Okubo, Dr. B. Soonthornsumrith, Dr. G. Guerriero 
	presented wonderful talks on different aspects of neuroendocrinology. 
	Finally, Professor K. Tsutsui delivered a very interesting talk on a novel 
	neurohormone, Gonadotropin-Inhibitory Hormone (GnIH). GnIH was discovered 
	and reported by Prof. Tsutsui in 2000. Prof. Tsutsui showed about the 
	isolation, localization and functions of GnIH. He also showed that melatonin 
	acts directly on GnIH neurons via its receptor to induce GnIH expression. 
	Many participants briskly participated on GnIH discussion as soon as Prof. 
	Tsutsuis finished his talk.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">At 
	the closing session, two of the the organizers Professors P. Tangpraprutgul 
	and Prof. J. F. Cockrem delivered the concluding remarks. They gave an 
	account to the audience about their full satisfaction of many excellent 
	presentations on biodiversity, environmental endocrinology, molecular 
	endocrinology and many others during the two and half days scientific 
	sessions. Different themes of the AOSCE have been pointed out at this 
	session. For example, the AOSCE recommended studying the animals from Asia 
	and Oceania region to discover the biological phenomenon and to reveal the 
	specific questions of biology of these regions. This society considered 
	performing complete study from the whole animal up to its molecular level. 
	The future directions of the AOSCE had also been pointed out in concluding 
	remarks. For example, The AOSCE should give attention to develop dedicated 
	and committed endocrinologists and comparative endocrinologists. The AOSCE 
	should contribute to the enhancement of the international comparative 
	endocrinology. In the evening on Feb 9, there was a Banquet at the Thai 
	Pavillion in Chulalongkorn University. The participants of the conference 
	enjoyed the fascinating environment of the Banquet along with Thai food and 
	traditional Thai dance a lot. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">On 
	Feb 10, the last day of AOSCE2006 symposium, there was a very enjoyable 
	excursion trip to Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province, Bangkok. The delegates 
	got the opportunity to enjoy Thai places, timeless canals and rivers, which 
	duly dubbed the city Venice of the East as well as the excitement of a 
	dynamic metropolis.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">To 
	conclude, I should say that the AOSCE2006 intercongress was a wonderful 
	symposium. The overall environment of the conference was truly favorable to 
	enjoy the progress of comparative endocrinology. It was also a great 
	opportunity to refresh old and build up new friendship. This symposium was 
	really encouraging to be more ambitious to discover the endocrine nature of 
	living being. It would be more pleasant for me if I could see more 
	participants from Bangladesh. It is well known to everybody that the 
	countries, which are progressing with sound policies, offer a great 
	attention on research works. Because basic research findings prepare the 
	platform on which development in all aspects is performed, both the basic 
	and applied researches in all disciplines are very crucial for the 
	development of any country. Therefore, it is expected to see that the policy 
	makers and other related people of Bangladesh are actively playing their 
	roles to develop a favorable environment for research works. I hope that my 
	country will realize the necessity of research works within its own 
	environment and provide the necessary facilities to perform it more actively 
	and sincerely to make the living enjoyable with sound progress in all 
	aspects.</span></p>
