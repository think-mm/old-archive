	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dear CNN, </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Well, the week is over -- and still 
	no apology, no retraction, no correction of your glaring mistakes. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I bet you thought my dust-up with 
	Wolf Blitzer was just a cool ratings coup, that you really wouldn't have to 
	correct the false statements you made about &quot;Sicko.&quot; I bet you thought I was 
	just going to go quietly away. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Think again. I'm about to become 
	your worst nightmare. 'Cause I ain't ever going away. Not until you set the 
	record straight, and apologize to your viewers. &quot;The Most Trusted Name in 
	News?&quot; I think it's safe to say you can retire that slogan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You have an occasional segment 
	called &quot;Keeping Them Honest.&quot; But who keeps you honest? After what the 
	public saw with your report on &quot;Sicko,&quot; and how many inaccuracies that 
	report contained, how can anyone believe anything you say on your network? 
	In the old days, before the Internet, you could get away with it. Your 
	victims had no way to set the record straight, to show the viewers how you 
	had misrepresented the truth. But now, we can post the truth -- and back it 
	up with evidence and facts -- on the web, for all to see. And boy, judging 
	from the mail both you and I have been receiving, the evidence I have posted 
	on my site about your &quot;Sicko&quot; piece has led millions now to question your 
	honesty. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I won't waste your time rehashing 
	your errors. You know what they are. What I want to do is help you come 
	clean. Admit you were wrong. What is the shame in that? We all make 
	mistakes. I know it's hard to admit it when you've screwed up, but it's also 
	liberating and cathartic. It not only makes you a better person, it helps 
	prevent you from screwing up again. Imagine how many people will be drawn to 
	a network that says, &quot;We made a mistake. We're human. We're sorry. We will 
	make mistakes in the future -- but we will always correct them so that you 
	know you can trust us.&quot; Now, how hard would that really be? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As you know, I hold no personal 
	animosity against you or any of your staff. You and your parent company have 
	been very good to me over the years. You distributed my first film, &quot;Roger &amp; 
	Me&quot; and you published &quot;Dude, Where's My Country?&quot; Larry King has had me on 
	twice in the last two weeks. I couldn't ask for better treatment. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">That's why I was so stunned when you 
	let a doctor who knows a lot about brain surgery -- but apparently very 
	little about public policy -- do a &quot;fact check&quot; story, not on the medical 
	issues in &quot;Sicko,&quot; but rather on the economic and political information in 
	the film. Is this why there has been a delay in your apology, because you 
	are trying to get a DOCTOR to say he was wrong? Please tell him not to 
	worry, no one is filing a malpractice claim against him. Dr. Gupta does 
	excellent and compassionate stories on CNN about people's health and how we 
	can take better care of ourselves. But when it came time to discuss 
	universal health care, he rushed together a bunch of sloppy -- and old -- 
	research. When his producer called us about his report the day before it 
	aired, we sent to her, in an email, all the evidence so that he wouldn't 
	make any mistakes on air. He chose to ignore ALL the evidence, and ran with 
	all his falsehoods -- even though he had been given the facts a full day 
	before! How could that happen? And now, for 5 days, I have posted on my 
	website, for all to see, every mistake and error he made. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You, on the other hand, in the face 
	of this overwhelming evidence and a huge public backlash, have chosen to 
	remain silent, probably praying and hoping this will all go away. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Well it isn't. We are now going to 
	start looking into the veracity of other reports you have aired on other 
	topics. Nothing you say now can be believed. In 2002, the New York Times 
	busted you for bringing celebrities on your shows and not telling your 
	viewers they were paid spokespeople for the pharmaceutical companies. You 
	promised never to do it again. But there you were, in 2005, talking to Joe 
	Theismann, on air, as he pushed some drug company-sponsored website on 
	prostate health. You said nothing about about his affiliation with 
	GlaxoSmithKline. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Clearly, no one is keeping you 
	honest, so I guess I'm going to have to do that job, too. $1.5 billion is 
	spent each year by the drug companies on ads on CNN and the other four 
	networks. I'm sure that has nothing to do with any of this. After all, if 
	someone gave me $1.5 billion, I have to admit, I might say a kind word or 
	two about them. Who wouldn't?! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I expect CNN to put this matter to 
	rest. Say you're sorry and correct your story -- like any good journalist 
	would. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then we can get back to more 
	important things. Like a REAL discussion about our broken health care 
	system. Everything else is a distraction from what really matters. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yours, Michael Moore <br>
	<a href="mailto:mmflint@aol.com">mmflint@aol.com</a> <br>
	<a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com">www.michaelmoore.com</a>&nbsp; </font>
	</p>
	<p><b>P.S.</b> If you also want to apologize for not doing your job at the 
	start of the Iraq War, I'm sure most Americans would be very happy to accept 
	your apology. You and the other networks were willing partners with Bush, 
	flying flags all over the TV screens and never asking the hard questions 
	that you should have asked. You might have prevented a war. You might have 
	saved the lives of those 3,610 soldiers who are no longer with us. Instead, 
	you blew air kisses at a commander in chief who clearly was making it all 
	up. Millions of us knew that -- why didn't you? I think you did. And, in my 
	opinion, that makes you responsible for this war. Instead of doing the job 
	the founding fathers wanted you to do -- keeping those in power honest 
	(that's why they made it the FIRST amendment) -- you and much of the media 
	went on the attack against the few public figures like myself who dared to 
	question the nightmare we were about to enter. You've never thanked me or 
	the Dixie Chicks or Al Gore for doing your job for you. That's OK. Just tell 
	the truth from this point on.
