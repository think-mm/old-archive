	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;<font face="Verdana">In the 
	book, Rajshahir Itibrittya, Mr. Samad included 26 topics with individual 
	chapters, for examples, Geographical boundary, Ethnicity, Old history, 
	Muslim Culture in the Middle Age, Silk and Indigo Cultivation, the Jamindars 
	and Education and Culture, Social System of Early Days, Christian 
	Missionaries, Muslim Peers, Aolias and Darbeshes, Changes in the Muslim 
	Ideology, Folk Culture, Nath Literature, Khetu Fairs of the Baishnavas, 
	Trees and Animals, Wars, Crimes and Punishment, Natural Calamities, 
	Technical Education and Rajshahi University. Since the title of the book is 
	on the History of Rajshahi, it would have been better if the historical 
	events were arranged in terms of historical time frames rather than putting 
	times into topic frames. Instead, the author used a free form of 
	presentation like a story teller. The book could have some references to 
	published literatures on Rajshahi too.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
	Religious Prejudice of the Author</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	book contains valuable information of Rajshahi over a significant period of 
	time even though not in any chronological order. This book could earn some 
	credibility and virtue if the author were not busy with his concerted effort 
	of portraying a particular religious community as superior to the others. He 
	seemed to be very gleeful with a feeling of being physically present at the 
	birthplace of his religious master whenever he could identify any word of 
	Middle Eastern origin. The author’s personal comments on the religion based 
	communities are prejudiced and irritating throughout the book even though 
	mentions were often inconsistent. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 
	very first page, he says that the son of King Ganesh (Jadu) accepted Islam 
	at his own will (p. 1). “At his own will” signifies that Jadu was amazed at 
	the religious superiority of Islam over his own religion. Unfortunately 
	Murshid [1] tells a different story. The Muslims were not pleased with the 
	Hindu king, Ganesh. They planned to invite the mighty Moghal emperor in 
	Delhi to dethrone him. Ganesh was not a match to the Emperor. He tried to 
	appease the Muslims. Nothing worked. He found the only option, to protect 
	the kingdom for his son to heir, was to have him converted to Islam before 
	it was too late.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">He made 
	his prejudice very transparent by saying that the Hindu community had lot of 
	problems, but the Muslim community did not have any (p. 65). This is 
	ridiculously a childish claim. A community without any problem is just 
	impossible to exist on the face of this earth. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. 
	Samad’s subjective mind drove him to ridicule the Hindus by all means. He 
	vomited all his anger and prejudice against the Hindus throughout the book. 
	Now with this book published he should be comforted and cooled down. In the 
	Muslim majority Bangladesh, the Hindus are the everyday target and subject 
	of oppression for their lives, property and honor. Hardly any events are 
	brought out to fill the newspaper columns. The Hindus have learnt to keep 
	quite to avoid further persecution because there is no justice available for 
	fair trials.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
	Widows in the Hindu Society and the Great Nikah System(!) in the Muslim 
	Society</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 
	Hindu society, the widows were not allowed to marry again. As a result some 
	were seen to get engaged into illegal activities (p.58, 59). But the Muslim 
	society had a good system for the widows to get married again. It is called 
	Nikah (p.85). A Muslim man in Rajshahi could have any number of nikah women 
	in addition to four regular wives. The nikah women did not have equal status 
	like women from regular marriages (p.85). But the good thing about nikah, as 
	Mr. Samad mentioned, was its easy divorce. Even a woman could divorce 
	instantly if she wished not to stay with the man any more (p.85). Does it 
	not bring the prostitution home? Does it not legalize prostitution for food 
	and lodging, Mr. Samad? How in the world this prostitution system could be 
	praised? Certainly these women did not get any property on divorce. What was 
	the provision for any child born to a nikah woman? Mr. Samad found a great 
	thing on a system which could survive for any duration of time from a few 
	years down to a few months, few weeks or to even a few days. This reminds me 
	of a Thai plumber who came to fix my bathroom water system in Thailand in 
	1977. With broken English, he said, “I go to Rangsit (a prostitute place) 
	and marry for one hour. Every time I get a new girl.” </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	nikah system is still in prevalent. A poor widow in a village usually goes 
	through a series of nikah as long has she possesses sex appeal. She 
	eventually becomes a street beggar. How can it be better than a Hindu widow? 
	I have seen lots of nikah women living on begging, but never had I seen a 
	single Hindu widow begging. The Hindu society does not guarantee her sexual 
	need but protects her other dignities and honors in the family. A widow 
	without any child may have a chance of mistreatment from the family of the 
	deceased husband. The society enforces the family to provide lifetime 
	ownership of some property to ensure food and lodging. The so-called Nikah 
	system of Mr. Samad is no where near the Hindu widow protection system.</font></p>

	Durga Puja Financed by Muslim Peasants</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Hinud 
	Jamindars spent lavishly on Durga puja festivals with money collected as tax 
	mostly from Muslim peasants (p. 42). Mr. Samad, you can not help here. 
	Taxation is universal. Let me comfort you. Samrat (King) Shahjahan ruled a 
	kingdom where 90% of the population was non-Muslims. With the money he 
	collected from this non-Muslim population, he built a monument to make him 
	immortal. Instead of building the Tajmahal, he could have done thousands of 
	philanthropic works, like, schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, roads 
	and so forth. Both Muslims and non-Muslims, rich and poor, could have been 
	benefited, or he could reduce the amount of tax burden on the peasants. He 
	never thought about any philanthropy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Rabindranath Tagore is an accomplished person even today and will remain as 
	such for his immense contribution to Bengali literature, music and arts. He 
	was honored with Nobel Prize in 1913. This is one certificate that he was 
	the citizen of the world. His two songs are being used as National Anthems 
	in India and Bangladesh. Yet Mr. Samad could not find a single good quality 
	in Tagore. Rather he tried his best to defame Tagore with all his strength, 
	anguish and narrow vision.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">In 
	recent time, Professor Yunus has become a world renowned figure because of 
	his Grameen Bank for rural the people. About one hundred years before 
	Professor Yunus’ time, Tagore thought of helping the poor peasants. He 
	established one Agriculture Bank in Patisar, Naogaon, Rajshahi by borrowing 
	money at 8% rate from his well-wishers. He also put the total amount of Taka 
	108,000 that he obtained as part of the Nobel Prize. Mr. Samad mentions all 
	these at pages 51-52. This bank was one of his noblest efforts to help out 
	the poor farmers from the evil grips of the then rich people, Hindus and 
	Muslims. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">But the 
	author could not find any philanthropy of Tagore on it. Rather, it caused 
	him body ache. He accused Tagore because the bank charged the borrowers at a 
	rate of 12%. Do the peasants get interest free money from the Grameen bank 
	established by Professor Yunus, Mr. Samad? The way the interest is 
	calculated and charged, it goes up to 35%.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">He 
	mentioned that the farmers during the reign of Sher Shah had to pay 
	one-fourth (25%) of the produce as tax. Akbar, the so-called great king, 
	asked for one-third (33.33%) (p.39). Interestingly, Mr. Samad did not 
	mention a single word against these super high interest rates. The author 
	did not mention the high interest rates the rich of that time in Rajshahi 
	used to charge against the poor peasants. The rich of those days used to 
	lend money purposely at such a high rate with one-sided terms and conditions 
	such that the poors ultimately had to end up by loosing their mortgaged 
	lands and houses to the lenders. Tagore’s bank might have protected hundreds 
	of thousands of poor peasants from the ill devises of the then rich people. 
	The rich, like Mr. Samad, might have been angry against Tagore’s bank for 
	losing their easy but lucrative businesses. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Unfortunately Tagore’s bank failed and he lost all of the Nobel Prize money. 
	In the end this brought immense joy and happiness to the author. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">In 
	1910, Tagore established a high school in Patisar (p.51). Again, Mr. Samad 
	did not see any benefit of it. As usual he found fault on Tagore and accused 
	him as the peasants had to pay an extra tax of 3 Paisas for each Taka (64 
	Paisas made a Taka). Just to educate Mr. Samad, it is worth mentioning that 
	the Independent Schools District system in the USA is supported mostly from 
	the tax paid by the local residents.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	Muslims occupied India and ruled it until the British defeated them and took 
	over the administration. The British ended its rule in August of 1947. At 
	the demise of British power, this Muslim did not want to be ruled by the 
	majority Hindus. For a Muslim, Islam is the first and foremost identity; 
	state or cultural identity is always the secondary issue. Therefore, on 
	their demand India was cut into three pieces. With two pieces, located 1000 
	miles away because of the main land India in between, the Muslim dream land 
	Pakistan was created. The western piece was named as West Pakistan and the 
	eastern piece as East Pakistan. Other than the religion, the people of East 
	Pakistan did not have any commonality with that of West Pakistan. Rather, it 
	had more commonalities with the people of the neighboring states of India. 
	The East started realizing that the West Pakistan was dominating too much. 
	The western part tried to keep East Pakistan attached emphasizing more on 
	its religious identity. It emphasized any tie with the neighboring India as 
	the act of infidels which is against the tenet of Islam. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore 
	was an extra-ordinary human being. His work has tremendous power and energy 
	in the search for cultural heritage and patriotism. The Pakistani 
	administration knew it very well and took all measures to ban the works of 
	Tagore in East Pakistan. Mr. Samad grew up with this Islamic spirit of 
	Pakistani teachings. He digested this spirit in his blood stream which 
	always drives him to hate Tagore and his works. Unfortunately to Mr. Samad, 
	Tagore’s teaching is universal and undefeatable. A government can fight down 
	human beings but not the humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1970 
	national election, the people from East Pakistan had the mandate to form 
	government. But the West did not want it. The East got upset. The religious 
	identity got weakened. Cultural identity became dominant. Tagore’s 
	literature, particularly patriotic songs, penetrated deep into the heart and 
	blood and thrilled and inspired them to die until East Pakistan was 
	liberated to independent Bangladesh. Tagore, in fact, virtually acted as the 
	Chief Commander of liberation war.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Unfortunately soon after liberation, the taste of liberation started 
	becoming bitter. Many elites started realizing that the liberation was just 
	a defeat of Islamic brotherhood. It was the victory of the Kafir country 
	India. It caused heavy sore in the minds and hearts of Mr. Samad and others 
	and new wave of anti-India feeling started. Patriotic songs were stopped 
	right after liberation. Popularity of Tagore remained limited to the 
	so-called progressive people only. With his reasons and justifications, Mr. 
	Samad clearly distances himself from this so-called progressive segment of 
	the population of Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">With 
	his deep hatred against Tagore, he believes that the cost of Tagore’s world 
	trip used to come from the poor peasants of Patisor (p.51). Mr. Samad does 
	not have idea that Tagore did not travel the world for pleasure. All his 
	travels were part of invitations from academic societies around the globe 
	and every time he was paid with handsome honorarium for his lectures. He put 
	all these money to his Vsva Bharati to grow and sustain. The real source of 
	his income was through his writings. Mr. Samad may not like his works but 
	the whole India and even the world adored him with due respect and honor.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	author, Mr. Samad, read about one Rani Bhabani who earned fame and 
	reputation with lot of philanthropic activities. To tarnish her reputation 
	he cited one story that she wanted to gift her own daughter to Nawab 
	Sirajuddoulla, but the Nawab’s did not accept the gift. What a fabulous 
	story (p.36)? How could a mother give away her daughter to prostitution? 
	Reference? None. Now I know what I did not know about Sirajuddoulla; he 
	might have been a stupid womanizer, an invader to grab kingdoms of others by 
	force. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr.

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">In 
	modern times, Bangladesh has several agricultural colleges and universities. 
	Long time back, Annadashankar Roy realized the importance of education in 
	agricultural science and introduced one course on agriculture (p.106). As 
	usual, Mr. Samad failed to understand the foresightedness of Mr. Roy. He put 
	up a theory that Mr. Roy had ulterior motive to tie and keep the Muslims as 
	peasants for generations.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">One 
	leader of Congress, with name Mohan Das Karam Chand Gandhi, came to Rajshahi
