      <p style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial">I watched a program on CNN 
      a few days ago where anchors interviewed US politicians and campaign 
      strategists from both the Democratic and Republican parties. The topic of 
      the program was US foreign policy, something Americans are going to vote 
      on in the upcoming election. The topic of Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
      brought out some painful truths.<br>
      <br>
      As a spokesperson from the Arab-American community pointed out, 
      representatives of the two parties were engaged in battling out who was a 
      better friend of Israel and regurgitating the standard monologue about 
      Israel’s right to defend itself. Neither group however expressed any 
      knowledge or understanding of the conflict from the other perspective, 
      i.e. from the Palestinian point of view. The idea of being even handed or 
      neutral in this conflict evades most Americans and their country pays a 
      price for it unbeknownst to them. The resentment omnipresent in the Muslim 
      world towards American administrations needs no introduction.<br>
      <br>
      This highlights a major disconnect between American perceptions and 
      reality as the Arab-American spokesperson rightfully pointed out. It would 
      be convenient to blame Americans for their perceptions or ignorance. 
      Indeed their country’s media and the influence of the Jewish American 
      population are to blame for the monopoly of agenda when it comes to 
      America’s approach to this age old conflict. However, that does not 
      absolve the Muslim population around the world of its own contribution in 
      permeating this disconnect. In fact the Muslim world suffers from its own 
      disconnect with reality and have allowed it foster through its own actions 
      and politics. It is time to face up to this dismal reality.<br>
      <br>
      While it should be a matter of delight that Islam is certainly not 
      monolithic all throughout, i.e. the religion has spread across vast 
      cultures and have contributed to local cultures as well as derived 
      immensely from them, there are presently a few traits that are prevalent 
      in most if not all Muslim communities and countries. The most painful one 
      is a sense of victim hood. Loss of the Ottoman Empire, becoming colonial 
      subjects of European imperialists, creation of Israel, American support 
      for most Israeli policies regarding its conflict with and treatment of 
      Palestinians, and the dictatorial and monarchic regimes across most of the 
      Arab world can be attributed to the sense of victim hood. Muslims in 
      general fashionably hide behind these facts and Americans in general are 
      oblivious to them.</font></div>
    <div class="title-1">
      <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial">This sense has become 
      cancerous. Muslims have failed to rise above being victims and have shown 
      unwillingness to learn different perspectives. Politicians and Imams have 
      done a great job of allowing this stagnation of ideas to foster. American 
      support for Israel needs qualification and understanding. American 
      administrations have always supported negotiation between Israelis and 
      Palestinians. Current administration does and hopefully the next one will 
      support a negotiated two state solution. This means that while America is 
      fully behind the existence and security of Israel, it also supports the 
      same of a future Palestinian state.<br>
      <br>
      Muslims have failed to learn about America’s rational behind its support 
      for Israel’s existence and security. This is because they have equally 
      failed to learn about the Jewish Holocaust prior to World War 2 when 
      nearly half of the Jewish population of Europe was ethnically cleansed by 
      the Nazis. Anyone with a conscience visiting graveyards of massacred Jews 
      and Nazi concentration camps in Europe will come back with more than just 
      a sense of revulsion. This remains one of the ugliest blots in human 
      history. Yet Muslims in general seem oblivious to this. Knowledge and 
      understanding of this historical nightmare will shed some light on public 
      opinion in America.<br>
      <br>
      Christians in America have taken it upon themselves to express collective 
      guilt by supporting the existence of a homeland where Jews can be safe for 
      the future. This is the undercurrent of American foreign policy towards 
      Israel.<br>
      <br>
      The trouble with the creation of such a homeland was of course its 
      location and the resultant displacement of Palestinians that were already 
      there. Muslims are quick to ascertain that Palestinian lands were taken 
      away by the creation of Israel. Have Muslims ever paused to remember that 
      Jews have been on this earth for a considerably longer period than them 
      and were thus present in the Holy Land before them as well? If ownership 
      of that land is to be based on occupancy then the claim of Jews to that 
      land is more robust.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, Arabs too had established themselves in that area later and 
      both Jews and Arabs once shared that land. In that spirit of sharing, both 
      Jews and Muslims must reconcile themselves to the two state solution of 
      this conflict.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve this, the Muslim world must first and foremost cease 
      to view the world through the prism of this conflict. There is much 
      muttering around about how Jews and Christians have conspired to undermine 
      Muslim aspirations and too many people point to the plight of the 
      Palestinians as a prime example. Muslims must stop using this conflict to 
      propagate their sense of siege and suffering. In order to achieve this, 
      Muslims must realize that while Israel’s policies towards Palestinians can 
      be justifiably condemned, Palestinians are to be equally blamed for their 
      part.<br>
      <br>
      It has always been in the latter’s interest to be freed from Israel’s grip 
      and in live in their own country. Yet militants among them have done 
      everything within their power to derail that achievement. Relentless 
      suicide bombings against Israeli civilians have not only banished any 
      attempt at negotiation, but has enjoyed widespread support amongst 
      majority of Palestinians and the wider Muslim world.<br>
      <br>
      This is where Muslims have failed. Deliberate targeting of civilians 
      cannot be justified in the name of any faith or cause. It is morally 
      repugnant. While Israeli settlement activities in the occupied territories 
      have been perceived as an equal threat to future negotiation, it was 
      incumbent upon Palestinians to take the Gandhian approach of non-violence 
      to achieve their goal. Indeed there would have been a Palestinian State 
      long time ago had Muslims not considered such suicide bombings as 
      legitimate forms of resistance and had Yassir Arafat showed true 
      statesmanship.<br>
      <br>
      While the Islamic world seethes in anger over the Palestinian plight, 
      there is hardly any acknowledgement that Muslims have done their part in 
      fostering this situation through their moral and financial support of an 
      immoral an unethical tactic.<br>
      <br>
      It is due to the inability of the Muslim world to concede to this 
      accusation that Americans find it difficult to meet the Islamic world half 
      way in understanding the latter’s point of view when it comes to this 
      conflict. Every suicide bombing against an Israeli civilian reinforces 
      American perceptions that Israel has a right to defend itself. Every 
      suicide bombing stalls further discussion and understanding.<br>
      <br>
      Both the bombings and support they enjoy must end once and for all. So 
      should the Muslim perception of the world that has been so adulterated by 
      the fostering of this conflict.</font></p>
      <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial">Once it is possible to 
      break out of the perpetual sense of victim hood, it will also be possible 
      to break out of the habit of lumping all the world’s conflicts in one 
      basket and coloring them in the same fashion as the Israeli-Palestinian 
      conflict. Pakistani President’s comments at the UN about Muslims finding 
      themselves at the wrong end of most of the world’s conflicts and thus 
      somehow creating terrorism was most unhelpful. Every conflict has its own 
      nuance and deserves to be debated with its own merits and demerits 
      (something that would be very difficult in one article).<br>
      <br>
      Majority of the world opposed American invasion of Iraq. Americans were 
      bitterly divided on this issue and the fall of Saddam Hussein was 
      nevertheless accomplished at great cost to the Iraqis and Americans. This 
      article will not delve into the pros and cons of that invasion but it will 
      point out that while the rules of war were violated by Americans as 
      illustrated by prison scandals, they were violated ten folds by insurgents 
      in Iraq.<br>
      <br>
      Most of these insurgents have come from outside of Iraq, have the support 
      of the wider Muslim world and have engaged in the most atrocious and 
      deliberate killing and maiming of civilians both Iraqi and Western. 
      Bangladeshi media have often referred to these actions as part of a war of 
      liberation (from the then US occupiers). This view, shared among the wider 
      Islamic world, has not only aided the killings of Iraqis and Westerners 
      but has instilled a sense of fear and division among Iraqis and arguably 
      among Muslims.<br>
      <br>
      Their recent kidnappings and beheadings which they bravely broadcast on 
      the internet ought to make every Muslim and non-Muslim shake with 
      revulsion. What purpose do these tactics serve? All this in the name of 
      Islam and to free Muslim lands from the hands of infidel Westerners? Or 
      Nepalese or Indians? Or Bangladeshi cleaners? Where is the revulsion in 
      the Muslim world? Where is the condemnation? Thanks to the wider support 
      that these insurgents enjoy, the Holy month of Ramadan began this time 
      with the blowing up of several Churches in Iraq.<br>
      <br>
      Where is the outrage against these acts of barbarism? The Muslim world may 
      attempt to wash its hands off by blaming US, Britain and others for 
      creating the lawless scenario in Iraq in the first place by invading it 
      and having no plans for winning the peace. But that hardly explains why 
      Muslims have used their relentless sense of victim hood to justify and 
      support the acts of these insurgents.<br>
      <br>
      Listen to any Imam on a Friday prayer in a Mosque and often you will hear 
      the word ‘Jihad’ and how Muslim brothers and sisters all around the world 
      are suffering and must be aided by every believer. While this sense of 
      suffering can be subject to discussion and debate, one cannot understand 
      how that translates to bombings in Bali, siege in Chechnya, massacre of 
      commuters in Madrid, slaughtering of Christians by Muslims in Nigeria, and 
      the most heinous crime committed by fellow Muslims so far, the attacks in 
      America on September 11, 2001.<br>
      <br>
      Al Qaeda still enjoys support among many Muslims due to the latter’s 
      misguided pride in the organization’s ability to stand up to Western 
      infidels. Some proud Muslims (such as those I have met in Bangladesh) have 
      either justified or pleaded understanding of the actions of Al Qaeda in 
      the US, based on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Then there are those 
      that will forever remain in denial and blame Jews (or Israelis) for 
      masterminding 9/11 in order to undermine the position of the Muslims in 
      the world’s geo-political scenario.<br>
      <br>
      Muslims have done a very good job of undermining this position themselves. 
      It is not sufficient to dismiss the actions of a few rogue elements. There 
      has to be loud and wide spread condemnation of these elements from the 
      Islamic world and a complete and unreserved rejection of them, their 
      tactics and their philosophy or cause.<br>
      <br>
      Terrorism cannot not be condemned only to be later nuanced or explained 
      away in the same sentence.<br>
      <br>
      These elements enjoy widespread support of various degrees among most 
      practicing Muslims once again due to a sense of victim hood. This sense of 
      victim hood is the curse of the Islamic world. It is a curse that is 
      further strengthened by ignorance and illiteracy that is so prevalent in 
      many Muslim countries. It is strengthened by the failure of Muslims to be 
      their own critic. It is strengthened by the failure of Muslims to see that 
      the beautiful aspects of Islam (such as the current month of Ramadan) are 
      being eclipsed by the ugly manifestation of Jihad and all the support such 
      a concept enjoys.<br>
      <br>
      “Muslim Brotherhood” is being used as a counter model to that of the 
      modern nation states and there is every inclination to interpret the 
      religion based on a time long gone. This inclination will endeavor to undo 
      the fact that Islam has taken the shape and color of the cultures which it 
      has come into contact with. A world where the lifestyles of Bangladeshi 
      Muslims are identical to those of Saudi, Sudanese, Indonesian or British 
      Muslims would be a world void of variety and beauty. Yet that is what 
      reinterpreting the faith in the “wisdom” of the Taliban or Al Qaeda will 
      achieve.<br>
      <br>
      It will not return the Muslim world to the early days when learning and 
      enlightenment were its paramount features. It will take it to the dark 
      ages resembling the Taliban days in Afghanistan and to some extent present 
      day Saudi Arabia.<br>
      <br>
      Muslims must do their part in preventing any clash of civilizations. They 
      can only do this through education, democracy and enlightenment. They can 
      also do this by learning to look at world conflicts objectively and not 
      through the lens of victim hood (worst still just through the 
      Israeli-Palestinian conflict). Then they will have the upper hand in 
      demanding that the Western world meet them half way and take postures that 
      address any legitimate concerns of the Islamic world.<br>
      <br>
      The standard monologue of Imams stating that Islam is a religion of peace 
      (in response to a terrorist act of a fellow Muslim) must be put to 
      practice. Once Muslims have shunned violence permanently and 
      unequivocally, will we see a change in the pattern where barely 5 percent 
      of Americans polled express support or sympathy for the Palestinians in 
      their conflict with the Israelis.<br>
