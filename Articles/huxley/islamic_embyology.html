  <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000">T H Huxley</font></b></p>
  <p>I've completed an analysis of the errors in Islamic embryology for
  Mukto-mona readers.</p>
  <p>“Islamic embryology” is derived from both the Qu’ran and the hadith,
  and is quite consistent across all the contributing sources. The core of the
  story can be found in the Qu’ran, 022.005:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><br>
    <br>
    YUSUFALI: “O mankind! if ye have a doubt about the Resurrection,
    (consider) that We created you out of dust, then out of sperm, then out of a
    leech-like clot, then out of a morsel of flesh, partly formed and partly
    unformed, in order that We may manifest (our power) to you; and We cause
    whom We will to rest in the wombs for an appointed term, then do We bring
    you out as babes…”<br>
    PICKTHAL: “O mankind! if ye are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then
    lo! We have created you from dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a
    clot, then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may
    make (it) clear for you. And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs
    for an appointed time, and afterward We bring you forth as infants…”<br>
    SHAKIR: “O people! if you are in doubt about the raising, then surely We
    created you from dust, then from a small seed, then from a clot, then from a
    lump of flesh, complete in make and incomplete, that We may make clear to
    you; and We cause what We please to stay in the wombs till an appointed
    time, then We bring you forth as babies…”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  Here we find the three primary stages of embryonic development as defined by
  the Qu’ran. There is a “seed,” “drop” or “semen” phase (in
  Arabic, “nutfah”), followed by a “clot” or “leach-like clot” phase
  (in Arabic, “Alaqah”), followed finally by a “morsel of flesh” or
  “chewed lump” phase (in Arabic, “Mudghah”).<br>
  <br>
  There are a handful of additional ayaat that deal with this subject, and none
  of them disagree with this basic scenario. Yet there is more to learn from the
  hadith, particularly that of Bukhari and Muslim. Again, the accounts are quite
  consistent, and the additional information they provide is important.<br>
  <br>
  The first of these tells us about developmental timing: Sahih Bukhari Volume
  4, Book 54, Number 430:<br>
  <br>
  “Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mus'ud:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><br>
    “Allah's Apostle, the true and truly inspired said, &quot;(The matter of
    the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in
    forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period,
    and then a piece of flesh for a similar period.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  These exact details are also given in Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number
  549. Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 77, Number 593, Sahih Bukhari Volume 9, Book
  93, Number 546, and Sahih Muslim Book 033, Number 6390.<br>
  <br>
  The key information gained from all these ahadith are that the three phases (nutfah,
  alaqah and madghah) each takes 40 days, for a total period of 120 days from
  conception to the point at which the embryo becomes a fetus.<br>
  <br>
  One additional piece of testable scientific information is available in the
  hadith. It has to do with the point at which gender is determined. A
  representative hadith would be Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 77, Number 594:<br>
  <br>
  “Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><br>
    “The Prophet said, &quot;Allah puts an angel in charge of the uterus and
    the angel says, 'O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O Lord,
    (it is now) a piece of flesh.' And then, if Allah wishes to complete its
    creation, the angel asks, 'O Lord, (will it be) a male or a female?”<br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><br>
  This detail is repeated in Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 550 and
  Sahih Muslim Book 033, Number 6397, and all of them are quite clear that the
  embryo is neither male nor female until after the mudghah phase is reached,
  some 80 days (by Islamic counting) after conception.<br>
  <br>
  So, then, these are the details of embryology as reflected in the Qu’ran and
  the hadith.<br>
  <br>
  1) The embryo spends 40 days as a drop of sperm or seed.<br>
  2) The embryo then spends another 40 days as a “clot” or a “leech-like
  clot” of blood.<br>
  3) The embryo the spends another 40 days as a “lump of flesh.”<br>
  4) At that point bones form.<br>
  5) Then the bones are “clothed with flesh.”<br>
  6) And finally, the gender of the child is assigned by an angel at Allah’s
  direction.<br>
  <br>
  These then are the details that must be correlated with actual embryonic
  development to evaluate the accuracy or inaccuracy of the Islamic account. The
  question is actually a simple one:<br>
  <br>
  Does this account describe the first 120 days of embryonic development or
  doesn’t it?</p>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Discussion one: The Islamic Phases
  - Timing</span></b><br>
  <br>
  Taken together, the three phases of Islamic embryology take 120 days to go
  from conception to the point where the embryo becomes a fetus (i.e. an
  identifiable human baby), or right around 17 weeks. Does this reflect what we
  now know about embryonic development.<br>
  <br>
  The answer is patently, no. The human embryo becomes a fetus around week 9, or
  roughly half the time Islamic embryology requires. By day 56 the fetus is
  essentially a complete, though tiny, human being with all organ systems in
  place, and all tissues developed. This is right in the middle of what Islam
  calls the “alaquah” phase. In other words, the developing person is
  already a complete human being at a point where the hadith insists it (not he
  or she) still has almost three weeks remaining as a “clot of congealed
  blood.”<br>
  <br>
  In fact, there are no developmental milestones which can be mapped to the
  three 40 day periods required by Islamic embryology, even though they are
  stressed in several authoritative ahadith.<br>
  <br>
  <i><font color="#008000"><b>Conclusion: The hadith is demonstrably wrong
  concerning the timing of embryologic development.</b></font></i></p>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Discussion two: The Islamic Phases
  – Description</span></b><br>
  <br>
  The three Islamic phases of development are described in a very visual way,
  allowing for an informed evaluation of the accuracy of those descriptions.
  This might be expected if for no other reason than that during the Prophet’s
  day, there was not even the idea of a microscope, and any descriptions offered
  would reasonably be of objects that were visible to an unaided eye. And this
  is exactly what we find.<br>
  <br>
  And certainly, each of the three Islamic stages is described at a visible
  level of scale. A drop of seed, a clot of blood, a lump of flesh; all of them
  are objects of a size with which the ancient Arabs would have been familiar.<br>
  <b><br>
  The “Drop of Seed” Phase (Nutfah)</b><br>
  <br>
  There is little to no debate among Muslims as to the meaning of the word, “nutfah.”
  It is a “drop of seed” or “drop of semen” of the sort that would have
  been familiar to any adult Arab male. The Arabs rightly understood (as did all
  of their non-Arab neighbors) that semen was necessary to begin the process of
  procreation. But, exactly as with all their non-Arab neighbors, the writers of
  the Qu’ran and the hadith did not seem to understand that there was an egg
  produced by the mother that is fertilized by the male’s semen.<br>
  <br>
  The Arabs believed that the woman served simply as an incubator for a child
  that was fully contained in the father’s seed. There was no understanding of
  the actual biology of sexual reproduction, and no such understanding is
  apparent in the Qu’ran.<br>
  <br>
  Instead, the Qu’ran tells us that the “drop of seed” remains exactly
  that (a drop of seed) for the entire nutfah phase (40 days according to
  Bukhari and Muslim). What actually IS happening during those 40 days, and how
  might it be said to resemble a “drop of seed?”<br>
  <br>
  The actual “drop of seed” provided by the male dissipates within minutes
  of ejaculation, so even before conception, the literal “drop of seed” no
  longer exists. The case could certainly be made that the fertilized egg
  resembles a seed until about day 13 or fourteen, but the “drop” is long
  gone, replaced with a microscopic egg that moves through a period called the
  “blastocyst.” But by the beginning of the third week, the embryo has
  already begun to differentiate into a trilaminar embryo with the three layers
  of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. A mere two and a half weeks after
  conception, the embryo no longer looks anything like a “drop of seed,”
  while the Islamic tradition indicates that the nutfah stage should last for an
  additional three weeks.<br>
  <br>
  By day 40 of actual embryonic development (when the “drop” stage should be
  just ending and the “clot” stage beginning) the embryo is actually very
  well advanced. Measuring some 11 millimeters long, and the nervous system is
  well along its development. The embryo has eyes and ears, all four limbs have
  begun to form, the heart bulge is prominent. It bears no resemblance at this
  point to either a “drop of seed” or a “leech-like clot.”<br>
  <br>
  <i><font color="#008000">Interim Conclusion: The Qu’ran is in error
  describing the embryo as a “drop of seed” for any significant period of
  time, and certainly wrong in assigning a 40 day period to such a phase.</font><br>
  </i></p>
  <p><b>The “Leech-Like Clot” Phase (Alaqah)</b><br>
  <br>
  The word “alaqah” is a bit more ambiguous than “nutfah,” and so has
  been translated a bit more flexibly by Islamic apologists. Although
  consistently translated as a “clot of blood” by multiple translators,
  there are a handful of instances where it is rendered as “a leech-like
  clot.” This is the phase that (according to Bukhari and Muslim) should last
  from about day 41 to day 80 after conception.<br>
  <br>
  Among the many images of Allah’s creative power reflected in the Qu’ran
  and the hadith, the image of man having been created from a clot of blood is
  one of the most common, showing up over a dozen times in the Qu’ran, Bukhari
  and Islam alone.<br>
  <br>
  What actually IS happening during those 40 days, and how might it be said to
  resemble a “leech-like clot?”<br>
  <br>
  The period of development covered by the “alaqah” stage includes from week
  six until week eleven after conception. The first two weeks of this
  “phase” actually encompass the final two weeks of embryonic development,
  for at that point the baby is essentially completely formed, and from here on
  out is known as a fetus.<br>
  <br>
  Interestingly, at no time during this period (or any period for that matter)
  does the embryo or fetus resemble a “clot.” And while dependence of the
  placenta might be described as being vaguely “leech-like” in that it is
  attached to the uterine wall, no one would ever confuse the embryo or fetus
  with a leech.<br>
  <br>
  This is as good a point as any to point out that embryonic development is
  essentially over by day 56, or in less than one half of the time described by
  Islamic embryology.<br>
  <br>
  For over three weeks of the supposed “alaqah” phase, rather than a
  “leech-like clot” the fetus is actually a fully formed human being,
  ranging in size from 35 mm to about 80 mm in length.<br>
  <br>
  <i><font color="#008000">Interim Conclusion: The Qu’ran and hadith are in
  error describing the embryo as a “leech-like clot” for any period of time,
  and certainly wrong in assigning the period from 41 to 80 days for such a
  phase.</font></i></p>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <b>The “Lump of Flesh” Phase – (Mudghah)</b><br>
  <br>
  The Arabic word “Mudghah” is uniformly described as a “lump” or
  “morsel of flesh.” Sometimes, it is more descriptively referred to as a
  “chewed lump of meat.” According to the hadith, this phase would cover day
  81 to 120 of fetal development, or weeks 12 through 17.<br>
  <br>
  However, rather than a “lump” of anything, this period is one primarily of
  increasing size for the already fully formed fetus. During this period of time
  the fetus grows finger and toenails, begins to grow hair, and by the end of it
  the mother is beginning to feel the child’s movements. At no time during
  these weeks does the fetus look like anything other than an obvious human
  being.<br>
  <br>
  If there were anytime during which the embryo might be described as a “lump
  of flesh,” that would have been much earlier, perhaps during the fourth
  week. But even then, the embryo was quite organized and complex, hardly
  “chewed” in any sense of the word.<br>
  <br>
  <i><font color="#008000">Interim Conclusion: The Qu’ran and hadith are in
  error describing the embryo as a “morsel of flesh” for any significant
  period of time, and certainly wrong in assigning the period from 81 to 120
  days for such a phase.</font></i><br>
  <br>
  <i><font color="#008000"><b>Conclusion: The three Qu’ranic phases are
  impossible to conform with actual embryonic development, and that problem is
  only magnified by the timing of those phases as prescribed by the hadith.
  There are no actual phases that can be correlated to nutfah, alaqah or mudghah,
  and the level of development that Islam asserts takes 120 days actually takes
  less than half of it.</b></font></i></p>
  <p><br>
  <br>
  <b><span style="background-color: #00FFFF">Discussion 3 – Gender</span></b><br>
  <br>
  According to multiple ahadith, it is only after the mudghha phase (days
  81-120) that an angel of the Lord determines the gender of the baby. But in
  fact, modern genetics shows that the gender of the baby is determined at the
  moment of conception, and is therefore already set some four months before
  Islam asserts the question is even asked of Allah.<br>
  <br>
  <i><font color="#008000"><b>Conclusion: The authors of the Qu’ran and the
  hadith had no idea as to the genetic nature of gender, and assumed wrongly
  that it was assigned by Allah months after it was actually determined by
  genetics. The Islamic model is wrong again.</b></font></i><br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>Some Notes on the Interpretations of Dr. Keith Moore<br>
  <br>
  Dr. Keith L. Moore, Ph.D., F.I.A.C. of the Department of Anatomy, University
  of Toronto, Canada, has become a favorite of Islamic apologists ever since he
  accepted an invitation to produce a special edition of his Embryology Text
  Book specifically for use by Muslim students in Islamic Universities.<br>
  <br>
  In articles published widely across Islamic web sites, Dr. Moore goes on the
  record to provide a generous assessment of the Qu’ran and hadith in the
  light of modern knowledge about embryology. But a review of his “analysis”
  shows the extent to which he had to twist both the Islamic scriptures and
  modern science in order to get the “facts” to correlate.<br>
  <br>
  Specifically, Moore’s intellectual lapses are these:<br>
  <br>
  1) He liberally translates Arabic into terms that no Arabic speaker would
  consider justified, but that allows him to pretend the Arabic is closer to
  truth than it really is. For example, in spite of the fact that almost three
  dozen translations of “alaqah” found on line never once exclude the word
  “clot,” Moore writes instead that “The word &quot;alaqah&quot; refers to
  a leech or bloodsucker.”<br>
  <br>
  2) He completely ignores the timing of phases dictated by the hadith, for to
  consider them renders even his mistranslation unintelligeble. For example,
  after mistranslating “alaqah” to mean “a leech or bloodsucker,” he
  then compares it to the human embryo at 24 days gestation. But 24 days is
  still firmly within the “nutfah” phase, when the embryo should actually
  look like a “drop of seed.” He does the same with “mudghah,” comparing
  it with the embryo at 28 days, still in the “nutfah” phase and only four
  days later than he had assigned to “alaqah.”<br>
  <br>
  One might speculate on the reasons Dr. Moore might have for this travesty of
  embryology, but actually the answer is a simple one. He was apparently quite
  well paid for essentially no real additional work. The textbook he delivered
  to the Saudi Universities that commissioned the work is titled, &quot;The
  Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology with Islamic Additions.&quot;
  (ISBN 0-7216-6472-5).<br>
  <br>
  The base textbook is work that Moore had apparently completed years before,
  while the “Islamic Additions” appear to be the work of an Abdul-Majeed A.
  Azzindani, and not Dr. Moore’s at all.<br>
  <br>
  And an interesting side bar (of no real importance, but entertaining none the
  less) is that the Acknowledgments for the book recognize a number of
