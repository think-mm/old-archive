  <br>
  Islamic apologists attempt to claim that the “Big Bang” is actually
  described by the Qur’an in one of many miraculous displays of scientific
  precocity in text. Here, in a representative example of the claim, the Turkish
  apologist Adnan Oktar (writing under the pseudonym Harun Yayha) tells us:<br>

        <td class="quote">The expansion of the universe is one of the most
          important pieces of evidence that the universe was created out of
          nothing. Although this was not discovered by science until the 20th
          century, Allah has informed us of this reality in the Qur’an
          revealed 1,400 years ago:<br>
          <br>
          It is We Who have built the universe with (Our creative) power, and,
          verily, it is We Who are steadily expanding it. (Surat adh-Dhariyat:
          47)<br>
          <br>
          Another important aspect revealed in the Qur'an fourteen centuries
          before the modern discovery of the Big Bang and findings related to it
          is that when it was created, the universe occupied a very tiny volume:<br>
          <br>
          Do those who are disbelievers not see that the heavens and the earth
          were sewn together and then We unstitched them and that We made from
          water every living thing? So will they not have faith? (Surat al-Anbiya':
          30)<br>
          <br>
          There is a very important choice of words in the original Arabic whose
          translation is given above. The word ratk translated as ‘sewn to’
          means ‘mixed in each, blended’ in Arabic dictionaries. It is used
          to refer to two different substances that make up a whole. The phrase
          &quot;we unstitched&quot; is the verb fatk in Arabic and implies that
          something comes into being by tearing apart or destroying the
          structure of ratk. The sprouting of a seed from the soil is one of the
          actions to which this verb is applied.</td>

  <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Looking a Little Deeper:</span><br>
  <br>
  The first important point to consider is the actual statements of the
  Qur’an, and whether they have been honestly presented. Oktar quotes the
  Qur’an as saying in 51:47 “It is We Who have built the universe with (Our
  creative) power, and, verily, it is We Who are steadily expanding it.”<br>
  <br>
  Is that a fair translation of the aya in question?<br>
  <br>
  Well, not according to the three most highly regarded English translations
  generally available. Their versions are:<br>

  Not one of them contains the idea of an ongoing expansion of the universe. In
  fact, none of them refers to the “universe” at all, but to the heavens or
  firmament, in contrast to the aya immediately following which discusses the
  earth:<br>

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <br>
  <br>
  The dualism of the heaven and the earth is a recurring theme in the Qur’an,
  and to ancient Arabs they together would have been considered the entire
  universe. And generally, when one is referred to, the other marches right
  along with it in the repetitive pattern of most Arabic poetry.<br>
  <br>
  The problem here is that since the identical verb forms and grammar are used,
  to include tense, how can Oktar claim the first aya refers to an ongoing,
  continuing expansion of the heavens, without also concluding that the second
  must also refer to an ongoing, continuing spreading of the earth?<br>
  <br>
  Qur’anic cosmology is firmly geocentric, with the earth at the center of the
  universe surrounded by seven solid spheres (the “seven heavens”) within
  which orbited the stars, planets, sun and moon.<br>
  <br>
  But here Oktar has deliberately and deceptively altered the meaning of 51:47
  in three ways.<br>
  <br>
  He has mistranslated “heaven” as “universe” in the attempt to make the
  Qur’an sound conceptually more sophisticated than it really is, and to
  provide a stronger basis for his second and more significant distortion.<br>
  <br>
  He then not only translates the Arabic noun for “a vastness” into a verb
  meaning “expanding,” but he then adds the entirely superfluous adverb
  “steadily” in an attempt to insert into the Qur’an additional ideas that
  are not actually there. With these three translational liberties, Oktar has
  completely changed the meaning of this aya from a simple description of
  Allah’s creation of the heavens into a scientific statement of Hubble’s
  expanding universe that is not actually contained in the Qur’an.<br>
  <br>
  Oktar’s misuse and abuse of al-Qur’an 21:30 is no more legitimate than his
  mutilation of 51:47 although at least his translation is more loyal to the
  original. In this case his primary tool for distortion comes from the decision
  to take this single aya completely out of context, and so disguise its actual
  (and obvious) meaning.<br>
  <br>
  Here is the single verse as quoted by Oktar:<br>
  <br>
  <table cellSpacing="1" cellPadding="3" width="90%" align="center" border="0">

  <br>
  <br>
  Now that we have returned the verse to its actual context, let’s take a
  moment to contrast Oktar’s argument with what the Qur’an is actually
  describing. He claims that this is a description of the scientific fact that
  “when it was created, the universe occupied a very tiny volume.” In fact,
  there is no description all in this verse that could be interpreted at
  referring to volume in any sense.<br>
  <br>
  But more importantly, Oktar is claiming that the “unstitching” of heaven
  and earth described here is a reference to the “Big Bang,” or the
  primordial creation of the universe. If this were the case, then the
  “earth” mentioned here can not refer to the planet Earth, as its creation
  was still billions of years in the future from the event Oktar claims is being
  described.<br>
  <br>
  In other words, Oktar is implying (and many Muslim web sites and publications
  claim explicitly) that “earth” here means “matter,” and not the planet
  Earth itself.<br>
  <br>
  But the very next verse proves that this cannot be true. For in that very next
  verse Allah is setting on that same “earth” mountains and highways. How
  could this be if the “earth” in these ayaat meant anything OTHER than the
  planet Earth? When you further consider that the next aya after that concerns
  the “heaven” as a “canopy” or “roof” to that same planet earth,
  then the idea that this verse is a description of the “big bang” becomes
  completely impossible.<br>
  <br>
  These verses are exactly what they appear to be; they are a description of
  Allah’s creation of the planet Earth and the heavens above it, NOT a
  description of the creation of the universe as understood by modern science.<br>
  <br>
  The idea that the heavens and earth were once joined and then separated by the
  activity of Gods and Goddesses was actually quite common among pagans of the
  Middle East. Among the Egyptians for example, it was the involuntary
  separation of Geb (the earth god) from his wife and sister Nut (the sky
  goddess) that was responsible for the division of the earth from the sky. The
  Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh likewise describes the moment “when the heavens
  had been separated from the earth, when the earth had been delimited from the
  heavens” as a result of the separation of a sky God (An) from a earth
  Goddess (Ki). If you remove the pagan references, you have the same story as
  found in the Qur’an.<br>
  <br>
  Remember that in Muhammad’s day, the heavens and the earth WERE the entire
  universe. All the celestial bodies that could be observed were believed to
  reside within the concentric spheres of the “seven heavens.” The stars
  were even contained in the closest sphere to Earth in ignorance of the fact
  that their tiny size was simply an illusion caused by their great actual
  distance.<br>
  <br>
  This truncated understanding of the universe is responsible for the fact that
  there is no actual discussion of the creation of a “universe” in the
  Qur’an at all. The Qur’an is completely silent on the “big bang”
  because it clearly has no awareness whatsoever of a universe that preexisted
  the creation of the planet Earth, or extended outwards into infinite space. It
  has no understanding of galaxies, or clusters of galaxies, or quasars or
  pulsars... any of the OTHER things that could have easily been mentioned by an
  omniscient Allah, and left us no room for quibbling.<br>
  <br>
  And Muslim claims of miraculous scientific information in the Qur’an are
  shown to be, yet again, in error.
