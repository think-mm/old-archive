	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The killing of the 
	most prominent Baloch nationalist leader during a military operation in 
	Pakistan’s largest province Balochistan is proving to be a Pandora’s box for 
	the Musharraf government. Not only has it further fuelled the political 
	crisis in the country, it has also sparked a new wave of riots and protests 
	in this impoverished province. 79-year-old Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti had been 
	actively leading a tribal insurgency in Balochistan for the last few months. 
	And now his death is being viewed as the beginning of the biggest political 
	nightmare and apparently a defining moment in the chequered history of 
	Pakistan.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This southwestern 
	province of Pakistan has been in the grips of a low-level insurgency for 
	decades, but the last two years of unrest have seen a dramatic rise in 
	attacks on gas pipelines, railway tracks, security checkposts and government 
	installations. The Baloch rebels, supported by nationalist parties, have 
	been demanding more provincial autonomy and a greater share in the oil and 
	gas wealth of the province. Numerous attempts to negotiate the problem have 
	failed. The rebel tribes, led by the Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, have accused 
	the federal government of exploiting the province’s wealth while the 
	government has been blaming anti-state elements as well as neighbouring 
	country India of supporting the rebel movement with weapons and financial 
	aid. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A rocket attack by 
	rebels last December during President Pervez Musharraf‘s visit to 
	Balochistan sparked a military operation in the area. Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, 
	a former governor of Balochistan, had to flee his tribal stronghold and take 
	refuge in a remote cave-hideout. He has been accused of consolidating 
	influence by thwarting government efforts to bring basic health and 
	education facilities to the tribal areas under his control. Besides being 
	blamed for the deaths of dozens of soldiers and policemen, he has been 
	frequently criticised for supposedly operating private jails and maintaining 
	his own army. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now his killing 
	has sparked riots across Balochistan and in parts of Sindh by hundreds of 
	his supporters. Although the Prime Minister of Pakistan Shaukat Aziz has 
	insisted that the military was responding to militant attacks in the Dera 
	Bugti area and that Nawab Bugti’s death was an accident, but the opposition 
	parties -- referring to President Musharraf’s address to the nation on 
	August 20 -- have condemned this incident as an extra-judicial killing. 
	President Musharraf had, in that address, had accused the nationalist Baloch 
	tribal leaders of blackmailing the government and exploiting their own 
	tribesfolk: “I would say that these leaders are not only anti-government but 
	they are also anti-Pakistan. As far as Bugti is concerned he has earned 
	millions of rupees from PPL, the company operating the gas fields in 
	Balochistan, and more than that he has illegally taxed his own people and 
	earned millions more. He forcefully evicted more than 16,000 people from his 
	lands and now the military operation has enabled those people to return 
	without fear.” </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, a leader 
	of the main opposition party Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz group, Ahsan Iqbal, 
	is of the view that this incident is reminiscent of the 1971 operation in 
	the former East Pakistan, now Bangladesh: Bullets don’t unite nations, they 
	create hatred. The same thing was done in case of East Pakistan. Bengalis 
	were ruthlessly killed in the name of saving Pakistan. But actually Pakistan 
	was not saved then, it was broken.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;For the past many 
	weeks the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy in Pakistan (ARD), a 
	coalition of opposition parties, has been unsuccessfully trying to bring 
	about a vote of no-confidence against the government. This incident has 
	already started to catalyze the political crisis in the country. A series of 
	nation-wide protests and strikes has been announced by the ARD. Its chairman 
	and leader of Pakistan People’s Party Makhdoom Amin Fahim said: “We have 
	condemned this incident. The target-killing of civilian and political 
	leaders will not benefit Pakistan and it will have far-reaching 
	consequences. We have saying from the beginning that there should be a 
	process of negotiation with the people of Balochistan as equal partners. The 
	government can’t earn respect without giving it first.” </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Pakistani 
	media has also denounced the killing of Nawab Bugti. It is being said that 
	this decision was made by those who are clueless about the forces of 
	politics, history and nationalism. Political commentators have declared his 
	death as the second biggest blunder by the military after the execution of 
	former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1979, as it is likely to 
	further fuel the nationalist movement in Balochistan. A Baloch nationalist 
	leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal voiced similar sentiments: “Those who think that 
	this incident will demoralise the people of Balochistan are quite foolish in 
	their thinking. People will definitely react with rage but it is early to 
	tell the extent to which their anger will take them. It appears that in some 
	way or the other this country will have to pay for the mistake.”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Voicing the 
	sentiments of Baloch nationalists, veteran politician and Deputy Speaker of 
	the National Assembly Sardar Wazir Ahmed Khan Jogazai said: “The future 
	politics of Balochistan will rest on the dead body of Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti. 
	This is not a small incident. It’s a great tragedy which should be condemned 
	as much as possible.“</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This fiery 
	statement is a testament to the fact that Nawab Bugti’s killing is the 
	unfortunate yet expected outcome of the government approach to tackling the 
	issue of nationalism. It once again underlines the need for political 
	dialogue and non-military solutions to such problems. </font></p>
