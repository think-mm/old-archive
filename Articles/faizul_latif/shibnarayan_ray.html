	<h2><font color="#800000">A few personal words on Professor Sibnarayan Ray
	</font></h2>
	<p><font color="#800000" size="4">Faizul Latif Chowdhury </font></p>
	<p>
  <b><font face="Verdana" color="#6FB1D9">Published
	on March 07, 2008 </font></b></p>
	</center>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I came to learn about the death of 
	Professor Sibnarayan Ray Wednesday evening from a reference in a 
	post-editorial piece written by poet Al Mahmud. I could not believe that 
	Professor Ray was gone and the news was not covered in the media of 
	Bangladesh . I made a Google and Yahoo search and to my utter surprise, 
	nothing was turned up. I looked at the archives of The Statesman, The 
	Hindustan Times and The Telegraph. No reference. Last night Syed Tosarraf 
	Ali's obituary on late Professor Ray gave me the date of his last breathing. 
	Taking cue from that I gathered from the AnandaBazar of 27 February some 
	details of the circumstances relating to the expiry of this great Bengali 
	pundit. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I was living in the Mohsin 
	Hall, Serajul Islam Quadir, who lived in an opposite room to that of mine, 
	would sometimes show me letters from Sibnarayan Ray, then living in 
	Melbourne. Later, one day, I found a book in Nilkhte Bazar titled &quot;Kabir 
	Nirbashan O Onanyana Bhawna&quot;. It was a collection of essays by Professor Ray 
	published in 1973. The second hand book cost me Taka 10 only. I am grateful 
	to the person who considered that great book not worth preserving and 
	disposed it off, presumably through a &quot;Shishi-bottle- Kagoj-wala&quot;. I was 
	ushered into a height of Bengali mind which is a rarity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I had a chance of meeting Professor 
	Ray in Dhaka in 1989, when he had come to deliver a lecture on a literary 
	occasion. A thin upright person, simply dressed in pyjama-punjabi. He was 
	humble in his voice. He was firm in his conviction. He was logical, 
	analytical and consistent. He had no bias except that for logic. I still 
	remember one of his finishing sentences: &quot;If Bengali as a language has an 
	opportunity to flourish, that will be in Bangladesh and not in West Bengal.&quot; 
	On later occasions, when Sunil and Shrishendu visited Dhaka, they often 
	echoed Professor Ray's belief. In a very humble way I belong to the genre of 
	writers and has been publishing since 1973. But I can claim that I was most 
	gratified when Professor Ray published two of my articles in the Jijnasa of 
	1998-1999. It is deplorable that Jijnansa no longer is a regular quarterly.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With the risk of exaggeration I 
	would like to say that within my gamut of reading, I found Professor 
	Sibnarayan Ray the only Bengali whose way of thinking and writing gave out 
	the flavour of, I do not know how to phrase it, internationalism. While 
	studying in Melbourne I had occasions to meet two of his PhD students: 
	Marian Madderna dn Elizabeth Bachkovsky. The amount of respect these two 
	ladies showed for Professor Ray, his personality and talent, was simply un- 
	Western. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of initial essays was on the 
	paintings of Rabindranath Thakur published in as back as 1946. That promised 
	a great mind in the making. We should remain indebted to late poet Abid Azad 
	who published an anthology of essays of Professor Ray in 1990s from his 
	Shilpataru Prokashoni. I saw him at his house in Calcutta early last year. 
	He was still working on the 4th volume of complete works of Manabendranath 
	Roy. His comments on the poetry of Jibanananda Das were not very not very 
	enthusiastic. He pointed out the limitations of JD. This year, on the 
	occasion of Ekushey Boi Mela, I produced an anthology of 100 poems of 
	Jibanananda Das in English translation. Somoy Prokashon has published it 
	under the title &quot;Beyond Land and Time&quot;. The back cover contains a long 
	quotation of Professor Ray on Jibanananda. I have learnt three things from 
	Professor Ray. One, Bengali language needs to be strengthened with new 
	words, terms and novel syntactical patterns to be able to express intricate 
	thoughts. Second, in writing critical essays, one must take into 
	consideration the international perspective on the issue. Thirdly and 
	perhaps most importantly, knowledge is essentially a multi-disciplinary 
	exercise. Otherwise it remains half-knowledge or mere analyzed information. 
	May his soul rest in peace. </font></p>
