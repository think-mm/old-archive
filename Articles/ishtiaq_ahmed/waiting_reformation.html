                              An Islamic Reformation has yet to materialise, but
                              without it the Muslim world is seriously
                              handicapped, intellectually and materially, in
                              facing the challenges of the present and future</i><br>
                              <br>
                              The current wave of fundamentalist Islam conveys a
                              distorted image of the highly variegated Muslim
                              heritage. From quite early times diverse and
                              pluralistic approaches existed among Muslims for
                              understanding their religion. Some schools
                              approached the Quranic text as a multi-layered
                              discourse comprising literal as well as symbolic
                              and esoteric messages. On the other hand, populist
                              movements insisted that each word should be
                              understood in the literal sense. The latter
                              tendencies gave birth to anthropomorphist
                              doctrines about God’s detailed intervention in
                              all matters and came to represent the
                              fundamentalist strand.<br>
                              <br>
                              <b>Rationalism</b>, as a movement of free thought,
                              also made an early appearance and between the 9th
                              and 13th centuries it constituted a robust
                              intellectual activism with adherents in many parts
                              of the Muslim world. The first statement in favour
                              of rationalism was presented in the following
                              words by <b>Al-Kindi</b> (801-66): “We should
                              not be ashamed to acknowledge truth from whatever
                              source it comes to us, even if it is brought to us
                              by former generations and foreign powers. For him
                              who seeks the truth there is nothing of higher
                              value than truth itself” (Albert Hourani, A
                              History of the Arab Peoples, 1991: 76).<br>
                              <br>
                              The general assumption upon which Muslim
                              philosophers built their rationalism was that if
                              reason was applied correctly it could furnish
                              reliable and certain knowledge about the universe
                              but it was necessary to believe that some
                              knowledge comes only through revelation. The
                              Spanish-Arab philosopher <b>Ibn Rushd</b>
                              (1126-98) emphasised the pre-eminence of human
                              intelligence and philosophical reflection over the
                              apparent meaning of Quranic verses. He asserted
                              that <b>in case of a contradiction between the
                              truths discovered by philosophy and what the Quran
                              appeared to state, the discoveries of the
                              philosophers were to be relied upon and the
                              Quranic verses interpreted metaphorically</b>.<br>
                              <br>
                              For various reasons the rationalist movement could
                              not consolidate itself and the intellectual
                              leadership passed into the hands of <b>Imam
                              Ghazzali </b>(d. 1111). With the help of a simple
                              formula that revelation was superior to reason, <b>he
                              established the lasting hold of scholasticism over
                              Muslim intellectual activity. As a result
                              dogmatism became permanently entrenched in Muslim
                              intellectual discourses.</b> It is therefore not
                              surprising that the syllabi of the contemporary
                              Islamic madrassas are based on scholasticism and
                              dogmatism.<br>
                              <br>
                              In societal terms the implications were that the
                              Fuquha (jurists) and ulema seemed to have tacitly
                              reached the conclusion that all matters deserving
                              to be explained or regulated in law had been
                              covered by Fiqh rulings; the world had reached its
                              ultimate development which would last till such
                              time that decline sets in and the whole universe
                              declines into chaos, as predicted in the sacred
                              sources, culminating in the Day of Reckoning or
                              Qayamat. <b>Belief in such teleology allowed
                              medieval scholars of Islam to be complacent that
                              in future all that was needed was to apply the
                              rulings of Fiqh to specific circumstances.</b>
                              Such assumptions resulted in the doctrine,
                              ‘closing-of-the-gates-of-ijtihad’.<br>
                              <br>
                              It was in the 18th century that the
                              ‘closing-of-the-gates-of-ijtihad’ doctrine
                              began to be questioned. The new reformers were the
                              Wahabis of the Arabian Peninsula. They denounced
                              the cult of sufi-saints, visits to shrines in the
                              hope of intercession of dead masters on behalf of
                              a supplicant and a host of elaborate ceremonies
                              that had taken root in Muslim societies. Instead
                              the Wahabis subscribed to a strictly Unitarian
                              interpretation of Islam and sought to employ
                              ijtihad to purify contemporaneous Islam of
                              ‘un-Islamic accretions’.<br>
                              <br>
                              In one sense, the Wahabi reforms were not
                              different from the Reformation that Luther and
                              Calvin had successfully led in Europe. They too
                              strove to restore pure, unadulterated
                              Christianity, but it was purely fortuitous that
                              the scientific discoveries of that time undermined
                              the Aristotelian physics upon which the church had
                              built its view of the universe. Such a confluence
                              of religious reform and scientific change did not
                              underpin the Wahabi attempts at reformation.
                              Consequently it became a reactionary rather than a
                              progressive intervention in Muslim affairs.<br>
                              <br>
                              Muslim encounters with science and modernity came
                              via the colonial intervention. Following
                              Napoleon’s landing at Alexandria in 1798 Muslim
                              modernism began to take shape. However, under the
                              influence of Jamaluddin Afghani it reaffirmed the
                              supremacy of revelation over reason. He wrote a
                              famous pamphlet denouncing ‘materialism’, the
                              term he employed for describing science and the
                              scientific method.<br>
                              <br>
                              A more sophisticated position on reform was taken
                              by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. Deeply impressed by the
                              achievements of English rule and English
                              education, <b>Sir Syed adopted a
                              rationalist-scientific approach to phenomena by
                              arguing that Islam was not only a religion based
                              on reason as Afghani had asserted but also on
                              nature. Hence the name of his intellectual
                              movement, the Nechari (naturalist) School of
                              Thought</b>. Thus he not only supported a study of
                              Western natural sciences but also economic methods
                              and theory. In a bold re-interpretation of the
                              Quran, Sir Syed came to the conclusion that the
                              ban on usury was not applicable to modern banking
                              and commercial practices. His followers however
                              failed to sustain the Nechari School which slipped
                              into oblivion soon after his death.<br>

                              The intellectual leadership of the Muslim world
                              passed on to Allama Iqbal who reverted to the
                              scholastic position of Ghazzali and Afghani,
                              asserting that reality was spiritual and therefore
                              science, which could only deal with material data,
                              was inadequate for fathoming true reality. His
                              notion of ‘spiritual democracy’ charmed Muslim
                              League leaders such as Prime Minister Liaqat Ali
                              Khan who translated it into a constitutional
                              principle by declaring God and not the people of
                              Pakistan sovereign. Such formulations opened the
                              market for Abul Ala Maududi’s
                              ‘theo-democracy’ and Ghulam Ahmad Pervaiz’s
                              ‘Quranic democracy’ and many other novel but
                              bogus terms. Their disciples continue to churn out
                              even more confused and contradictory notions of
                              science, democracy and a modern economy of growth.<br>

                              <b>The government of Gen Ziaul Haq whose
                              fundamentalist leanings were proverbial caused the
                              greatest harm to rationalism. Elsewhere in the
                              Muslim world too fundamentalism became a prominent
                              state ideology in the 1980s and this situation
                              persists.</b> The result is that an Islamic
                              Reformation has yet to materialise, but without it
                              the Muslim world is seriously handicapped,
                              intellectually and materially, in facing the
                              challenges of the present and future.</p>
