  <p>Dear Sayon,</p>
  <p>I welcome you in MM for coming out with such an interesting post. However, 
  I think you are still quite young and very enthusiastic and like other cute 
  little children you got astonished while you found some&nbsp; miraculous 
  coincidence between Lincoln and John Kennedy in your library books. But I 
  know,&nbsp; When you will grow older and will develop&nbsp; your skeptical mind, you 
  will definitely perceive that&nbsp; <em>Most improbable coincidences likely result 
  from play of random events. The very nature of randomness assures that combing 
  random data will yield some pattern.</em></p>
  <h2><font color="#000080" size="3">Let us now take a look on Abraham Lincoln 
  and Kennedy's miraculous coincidence through a&nbsp; skeptic's eye :&nbsp;</font></h2>
  <h2>Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy</h2>
  <p>It is always possible to comb random data to find some regularities. A 
  well-known qualitative example is the comparison of coincidences in the lives 
  of Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy, two presidents with seven letters in 
  their last names, and elected to office 100 years apart, 1860 and 1960. Both 
  were assassinated on Friday in the presence of their wives, Lincoln in Ford's 
  theater and Kennedy in an automobile made by the Ford motor company. Both 
  assassins went by three names: John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald, with 
  fifteen letters in each complete name. Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse 
  and fled to a theater, and Booth shot Lincoln in a theater and fled to a barn 
  (a kind of warehouse). Both succeeding vice-presidents were southern Democrats 
  and former senators named Johnson (Andrew and Lyndon), with thirteen letters 
  in their names and born 100 years apart, 1808 and 1908. </p>
  <p><font color="#000080">But if we compare other relevant attributes we fail 
  to find coincidences. Lincoln and Kennedy were <b>born and died in different 
  months</b>, <b>dates, and states, and neither date is 100 years apart</b>. <b>
  Their ages at death were different,</b> <b>as were the names of their wives</b>. 
  Of course, had any of these features corresponded for the two presidents, it 
  would have been included in the list of &quot;mysterious&quot; coincidences. For any two 
  people with reasonably eventful lives it is possible to find coincidences 
  between them. Two people meeting at a party often find some striking 
  coincidence between them, but what it is -- birthdate, hometown, etc. -- is 
  not predicted in advance.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p>Here are some comments made by Kevin T. Kilty from rational point of view 
  on&nbsp; some miraculous cosmological &quot;co-incidence&quot; between Lincoln and Kennedy (

    </font><b>Comment</b><br>
    This is, of course, no more remarkable than two victims of assassination 
    being elected 96 years apart or 104. One hundred is just such a nice, round 
    number that people see extreme significance in it--much like they did the 
    year 2000, for instance. <font color="#000080"><b>There are many people who 
    have been elected president 100 years apart. And each being assassinated

    </font><b>Comment</b><br>
    Obviously people might think that both men entering politics 100 years 
    apart, and then being elected president also 100 years apart is a great 
    coincidence. However, when two people are separated by about X years in 
    history, it seems very likely, in fact more likely than not, that major 
    milestones in their lives are separated by roughly the same increment as 
    well. This is entirely expected. At least it is more expected than their 
    being elected to congress 100 years apart, and being elected president 150 
    years apart, because one of them would have been in congress as long as 
    Strom Thurmond. The parallel in political careers diverges here, for Kennedy 
    won a Senate seat in 1952, while Lincoln lost his Senate bid in 1858. </li>

    <b>Comment</b><br>
    It would be more amazing if they hadn't been concerned with civil rights, 
    because civil rights were <b><i>THE SOCIAL CONCERNS</i></b> of the day in 
    both instances. During both of these time periods the country was nearly 
    torn to pieces over the issue. In fact, to characterize the Lincoln 
    Presidency as being &quot;particularly concerned with civil rights&quot; seems a comic

    </font><b>Comment</b><br>
    This is a muddied statement that ought to read &quot;Both their wives lost a 
    child while living in the White House.&quot; In fact the Lincoln's lost three of 
    their four children before the children reached adulthood. The death of 
    children was not uncommon at the time. I am unable to find information 
    regarding the Kennedy child, but I recall this being a miscarriage, which is 
    not only surprisingly common, but makes the two losses not really 
    comparable. </li>

    <b>Comment</b><br>
    I originally thought this was a mistake through a mistaken calculation of 
    weekdays. I parodied the coincidence with, &quot;This would be an excellent 
    coincidence if it weren't for Kennedy being shot on a Thursday.&quot; However, a 
    Mr. Goldman wrote to point out my error and I stand corrected. It's nice to 
    see that someone reads this stuff. I just wish people would write for 
    reasons other than to point out my errors. Ah, then Mr. Goldman wrote back 
    to explain that <font color="#000080"><b>Lincoln was actually shot on

    This is quite difficult to analyze. How many secretaries and assistants did 
    each have? Did Kennedy choose Lincoln as secretary from a pool of applicants 
    because of his name? Sometimes coincidence is not all it seems. In fact, 
    Robert Lincoln the eldest son of Abraham Lincoln, was saved from a nasty 
    accident by J. Wilkes Booth's brother. Yet another cosmic connection? Most 
    recently a Mr. Patrick Vincent wrote to tell me that his research on the web 
    turned up evidence that <b><font color="#000080">Lincoln had no secretary

    J. Wilkes Booth was born in Maryland. I suppose that if one were trying to

    A biography of Booth that I found on the world wide web suggested that he 
    was known as J. Wilkes Booth. A Mr. Vsevolod Onyshkevych wrote to me and 
    advanced the theory that killers are often known by their full (three) names 
    and that this may be applied to each <i>after the fact.</i> He also provided 
    a list of stunning length of the names of killers found from biographies on 
    the web. Yes, Mr. Onyshkevych, the web is full of stange information. </li>

    </font><b>Comment</b><br>
    What a bore I'm going to be here. Let us suppose that the length of a name 
    is a random variable (Poisson perhaps) where the probability of very long or 
    very short names is small and the expected length is about 5 letters. Then, 
    the distribution of the summed lengths of three names is going to be sharply 
    peaked at 15 letters. In other words, this might be common. I can think of 5 
    members of my immediate family who meet this test also. </li>

    Well, I could explain this coincidence as resulting from the shear number of 
    theaters and warehouses, but the story of Booth's escape is so complex that 
    to characterize it as &quot;ran from a theatre and was caught in a warehouse&quot; 
    skirts the suburbs of misrepresentation. Booth was ultimately caught in a

    This is the climactic last alleged fact that the author decribed as &quot;the

    A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland.<br>
    A week before Kennedy was shot, he was in Marilyn Monroe.<br>

    I was pretty sure at this point that the whole e-mail was a joke. 
    Nevertheless, I have gone this far, and I may as well finish. Marilyn Monroe 
    died over one year before Kennedy's assassination. Once again Mr. 
    Onyshkevych has written to tell me that there is no Monroe, Maryland known 
    to the U.S. Post Office at least. Perhaps there was in 1865. </li>

  <p>Now you see Shayon, most of the miraculous co-incidences are actually not 
  miraculous. They are wide-spread lies and just wishful exaggeration. Then 
  again question comes why do actually people spread lies and exaggeration ? It

  <p align="left">Shayon,</p>
  <p align="left">It is very easy to convince others of bizzare coincidences by 
  using a logical flaw called &quot;back-calculating the probability&quot;. It is used 
  frequently by creationists in the evolution v. creation argument. A 
  creationist will look at a protein and say to you, &quot;This protein contains 600 
  amino acids. If any of these amino acids were different, this protein would 
  not function properly. Since there are 20 possible amino acids, the 
  probability of this particular configuration is one in 20 to the 600th power. 
  That is a very small probability, in fact one might say that it is too small 
  to be a coincidence and therefore there must have been divine guidance. To 
  someone who has not been taught to think critically, this might seem to be a 
  pretty convincing argument, but think about it this way....</p>
  <p align="left">There are 445 members in this group and each of us has a 
  birthday. Mine is August 6. There is a one in 365 chance that this is your 
  birthday. Now think about this--the chance that a group of people would have 
  all of the birthdays that this group does is one in 365 to the 445 power. It 
  would be pretty much impossible for a group of people to have this set of 
  birthdays, right--yet it just happened, right here. No divine guidance. No 
  bizzarre coincidences.</p>
  <p align="left">This may not have anything to do specifically with the 
  Lincoln/Kennedy story, but it is an example of how statistics and coincidence 
  can be used against you if you don't know how to look at them. Many fanatics 
  are masters of persuasion. Those who are not armed with knowledge are easy 
  prey for these people. If there are any critical thinking or logic classes 
  available to you, they are not a waste of time. When you find something that 
  is just too amazing to be true, keep searching for answers and you will be 
  amazed at what you find. I am to this day convinced that there is a logical 
  explanation for everything, even if it has not been figured out yet.</p>

  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/5021">
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/5021</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#003300">I would like to discuss some generalities relating to 
  coincidences and &quot;strange connections&quot; that would apply to all coincidences, 
  not just &quot;Kennedy's and Lincoln's strange connection&quot; that Shayon's post 
  referred to. I must admit that&nbsp;Shayon&nbsp;only presented some interesting facts of 
  coincidences (Although some of those &quot;facts&quot; may be distorted as Avijit's 
  research has shown) not drawn any conclusions from it. My discussion is 
  general and applies to those who may &quot;see&quot; some divine connection in those 
  coincidences.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  The desire to see divine connections or design in mundane occurrences of 
  coincidences is a strong human instinct arising out of a yearning for a world 
  beyond this observable one and rooted in the desire for life after death in 
  order to find a meaning of this life and to move on. This yearning was behind 
  Jung's theory of Synchronicity, which is nothing but a pseudo-scientific 
  mish-mash, although in his desperation he even tried to enlist some help from 
  his friends well-versed in Quantum Physics. He tried to link an aspect of 
  Quantum Mechanics called Quantum non-locality (Einstein called it spooky) with 
  apparent connections between human experiences. A case of pure quackery like 
  astrology. Quantum&nbsp;non-locality has many alternate scientific explanations and 
  is not &quot;spooky&quot; anymore, although it still remains the ultimate 
  epistemological intellectual challenge to physicists.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Anyway, the fact is that all coincidences appear to be strange connections to 
  many because of</font><font color="mediumblue"> <strong>(a)</strong>
  <font color="darkviolet">improper understanding of statistics </font><strong>
  <br>
  (b)</strong> <font color="darkviolet">selective bias of human mind</font></font><font color="#003300">, 
  and</font><font color="#008000"> </font><font color="mediumblue"><strong><br>
  (c)</strong> <font color="darkviolet">sometimes due to succumbing to 
  intentional manipulations of facts</font>. </font></p>
  <p><font color="#003300">Misunderstanding of statistics can lead one to view a 
  not-so-unlikely occurrence as <em>very</em> unlikely. Selective bias leads one 
  to forget and ignore the majority of events, all of which are individually 
  very unlikely, not treat them as coincidences or strange connections but only 
  the ones that appear to be interesting to the human mind.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  For example, if we roll ten dice the likelihood of getting the sequence 
  6526553214 is the same as 6666666666 both of which are equally likely and also 
  very unlikely to occur in one trial.<br>
  (1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6x1/6) But the former will&nbsp;not catch 
  anyone's attention, the latter will.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  When one is dealt a bridge hand of thirteen cards, the probability of being 
  dealt that particular hand is less than one in 600 billion. Still, it would be 
  absurd for someone to be dealt a hand, examine it carefully, calculate that 
  the probability of getting it is less than one in 600 billion, and then 
  conclude that he must not have been dealt that very hand because it is so very 
  improbable or that it must be a divine connection for him to get this rare 
  hand!<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Another important aspect of probability that is not appreciated by many is 
  that time and numbers play a very important role in statistics. A very 
  unlikely event will eventually occur given enough time. Or, equivalently, if 
  many trials are conducted for an unlikely event simultaneously, one of the 
  trials will materialize the very unlikely. Those who have studied statistical 
  Physics will recognize this in the Ergodic Hypothesis, a very important 
  concept. Sometimes we are amazed that out the billions of known stars and 
  their planets only Sun harbours wonderful life forms and only on the planet 
  earth. Is that a surprise? Life requires a sensitive range of conditions of 
  temperature, gravity, density of atmosphere, right distance from star, right 
  tilt of the axis, etc., for life to evolve. Only earth satisifes this 
  condition. Its like 6X6X6X6X6X6X6X6X6X6 people rolling ten dice at once. One 
  of them will certainly roll&nbsp;6666666666. Any surprise? All the billions of 
  planets are like ten rolled dice. Only one (earth) is 666666666 (i.e., has 
  conditions suitable for life forms). So here we are, on planet earth wondering 
  about life. If planet &quot;X&quot;, instead, satisfied the conditions of life instead 
  of earth then we would be on planet &quot;X&quot;. But then we would call &quot;X&quot; earth. 
  It's only a matter of label.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  How about the lottery? One lucky person picks the right number. Someone has to 
  win it if all the numbers are sold out. No divine connection. Yet the winning 
  person may view it as a divine connection for him to win it. Even if that 
  lucky person has just lost his home and belongings in a fire that would not 
  make it any more divine. Because again if anything can happen at all, it will 
  eventually happen, if one waited long enough. No one who&nbsp;has lost his 
  belongings in fire has ever won in a lottery before, in million years of human 
  history, humanity waited long enough&nbsp;for it to happen and finally it did 
  happen to Mr. X on day Y of&nbsp;Year Z. By the same logic a billionaire may also 
  someday win a lottery ticket (Talking about carrying coal to Newcastle!) 
  it&nbsp;would not have any different significance from the former case. No amount 
  of coincidences of PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE (i.e., natural) events can point to 
  divine or supernatural connections. Occam's Razor will always point to a 
  natural explanation through an eventual realization of a very&nbsp;unlikely (but 
  not impossible) event.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  A nuts and bolts calcualtion may help dispel the mystic of strange 
  coincidences that we sometimes experience in life (Like you were thinking of 
  an old friend in an airport and then suddenly he appears, approaching you). A 
  person may have 100 distinct experiences a day. In ten years, for 1000 people<br>
  that would mean 4950x3650x1000=18,06750000 pairs of events. So its very likely 
  that some of those events will be of strange coincidence types to some of 
  those 1000 persons.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  As a final example, let's take the case of &quot;prophetic&quot; dreams.&nbsp; Sometimes a 
  person &quot;X&quot; dreams of an event and the event&nbsp;takes place soon after the dream.&nbsp; 
  X sees a divine connection in his dream. Now, consider this. Normal people 
  have about 25 dreams/night. With 250 million people in US there must be 
  billions of dreams dreamt everynight and trillions in a year.&nbsp; With so many 
  dreams, some are bound to match with reality and seem prophetic. It would be 
  astonishing if there wasn't any (p-55 Schick).<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Some may object that the connections do not have to be divine. They could be 
  natural, but not mere chances. There must be some deep natural (scientific) 
  connections between them. This is what Jung had hinted at. But that is a 
  mere&nbsp;&quot;May be&quot;. A natural or scientific connection can only be made through 
  scientific method itself. And science has not found any connections between 
  such coincidences. Nor is there any need to.&nbsp; All such connections have been 
  explained nicely through Occam's Razor by probability theory, which is an 
  important tool of science as well.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  I hope to have dispelled some myth and misconceptions about coincidences. I 
  apologize if I seemed to have ruined any hope for divine supernatural 
  connection that certainly appears to be a more appealing option. And one can 
  continue to believe in that. After all, placebos are as effective (or more) a 
  therapy as real drugs. But if it did inspire a little bit of interest in 
  critcial thinking then I suggest going further and read the following two 
  books.<br>
