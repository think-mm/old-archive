	the outset, one thing must be made clear to the President, also the 
	caretaker chief. His splendid isolation is over. He has voluntarily chosen, 
	some will say with inappropriate hurry, to be in the thick of politics. 
	Consequently, he will have to bear the brunt of what being in politics means 
	-- most importantly, to be under constant public and media scrutiny. 
	Compared to the Presidency being a constitutional post, the caretaker 
	chief's is an extremely complex political one, and as such his every move, 
	every utterance, every use of words, every action and even his silence and 
	non-action in matters will be subject to severe examination by the people. 
	This is all part of the job and also part of the people's right to know that 
	strengthens democracy like nothing else does. Our politicians never 
	understood it. We hope the President does. In the spirit of that public 
	scrutiny the first question that Prof. Iajudding will have to answer is 
	whether he will serve the nation or his benefactors? We admit the question 
	is hard and even aggressive. But it is valid. The question is now ringing in 
	the public mind and the faster he accepts it the better he will have a 
	chance to chalk out his course of action. Please do not make the fatal 
	mistake of brushing this aside by saying that such a question is not in the 
	mind of the public but only in the mind of Awami Leaguers. If our readers 
	are any guide, then this question is very much in the air. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is no running away from the 
	fact that the BNP leaders and especially Khaleda Zia considered him more 
	trustworthy as President than Baddruddoza Chowdhury, BNP's founding 
	secretary general and perhaps the closest colleague of the party's founder 
	late President Ziaur Rahman. That, no doubt, is saying a lot. He also 
	carries the baggage of his involvement in the Dhaka University teachers' 
	politics where he always represented the pro-BNP panel. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Notwithstanding all this Prof. 
	Iajuddin was and is our President and has now become the chief of the 
	caretaker government. The future of our democracy is in his hands. He holds 
	two most important offices -- the head of state and the head of the 
	government. This makes him the most powerful man in the country today. But 
	alongside the power he enjoys, he has an enormous responsibility on his 
	76-year-old frail and heart-attack-recovered shoulders. It is an open 
	question that how a man who, until the other day was under doctor's advice 
	not to work more than a few hours a day, will handle the pressure of the 
	most complex office in the country. Yet he has taken the plunge which we 
	interpret as his courage and desire to move us forward in the right 
	direction (Please don't prove us wrong). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prof. Iajuddin will do well to 
	recall the very philosophy behind the creation of the caretaker system. He 
	should ask why a ruling party could not be trusted to hold free and fair 
	elections. Simply because the opposition feared that undue power and 
	influence will be exerted by the incumbent on the state machinery and 
	government structure, especially on the bureaucracy, police, other law 
	enforcement bodies, with a view to affecting the outcome of the polls.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In practical terms, it means that to 
	hold a free and fair election, a caretaker government has to create a level 
	playing field between the party that just relinquished power and the one 
	that was in opposition. To achieve that it has to take a whole range of 
	measures to reduce the influence of the immediate past ruling party over the 
	state machinery with all its paraphernalia and bring it to the level of the 
	opposition. Therefore, one can say that by definition the caretaker 
	government comes into effect to protect the rights of those who were out of 
	power and curb the influence of those who held the reins of the government. 
	It is on this particular aspect that Prof. Iajuddin's caretaker government 
	has to give immediate and special attention. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this regard, we would like to 
	recall the actions of the last caretaker governments of justices Habibur 
	Rahman and Latifur Rahman. Their first task was to gain the confidence of 
	the opposition. For that purpose they took immediate measures to cleanse the 
	administration and other government structures of questionable officials. 
	They made hundreds of key transfers and opened up government radio and 
	television for both sides. They also set up special bodies and committees to 
	look into ways to dismantle the official setup left behind by the past 
	governments. They took measures to recover illegal arms, round up criminals 
	and hoodlums patronised by political parties, and many other measures to 
	ensure a free and fair election. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We recall the most controversial 
	decision of the last caretaker chief, justice Latifur Rahman, which was to 
	transfer 13 government secretaries within hours of his taking oath even 
	before he formed his council of advisers. The AL, then immediate past ruling 
	party, reacted vehemently against it, to which Latifur Rahman paid no heed. 
	That one particular move had a salutary effect in galvanising the 
	opposition's confidence in the caretaker government. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prof. Iajuddin now has to take 
	similar and dramatic measures to gain confidence of the opposition. The need 
	for him to take such actions is far more important than it was for the other 
	two chief advisers as there was no controversy about their assuming the 
	office. We think Prof. Iajuddin lost a grand opportunity in his first 
	address to the nation on Sunday in making an imprint of his leadership on 
	the public mind. He should have tried to distance himself from the immediate 
	past government but instead he read out a speech that seemed to have been 
	drafted in the old mould. A different speech could have created an early 
	sense of confidence in the public mind, as in ours. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not only that President and 
	the chief adviser has to be neutral. He has also to be very visibly seen to 
	be neutral. We are acutely aware that it is a near impossible task given 
	Bangladesh's divisive and confrontational politics. But he has to try and 
	try it hard. At least he has to be seen to be trying hard. It is on Prof. 
	Iajuddin gaining that crucial credibility that much of his capacity to 
	deliver a free and fair election will depend. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With all the doubts and questions as 
	expressed above we still repose our faith in, what we have earlier called, ‚ÄúOur 
	last hope‚Äù. For President Iajuddin failing to deliver a free and fair 
	election is not an option. He has to rise up to the occasion. He has to gain 
	that vital moral high ground that will cast aside all the doubts and 
	questions that come from his BNP links and his not having so independent a 
	profile, and the way he came to occupy the key post of the caretaker 
	government. We believe it can be done. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most difficult but critical task 
	he faces now is choosing his council of advisers. Here lies his first test. 
	Yes, he will take suggestions from all political parties but he should 
	choose only those who are beholden to neither side of the political divide 
	and will genuinely help him to deliver a free and fair election. People of 
	the highest integrity, honesty and strength of character should form his 
	council of advisers, especially because of his frail health he will require 
	the most competent group around. If his advisers consist of a mix of 
	politically committed people then they will pull his government in one 
	direction or another, making his goal of a neutral administration almost 
	impossible. Political parties should help him by not suggesting party 
	activists or supporters but people who enjoy general public trust, 
	confidence and respect. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is our hope that given the fact 
	that he is teacher (in our culture a teacher is still a highly respected 
	person and is expected to embody many moral qualities), given his age, given 
	that he cannot really aspire for anything higher than what circumstances 
	have awarded him with, given that the nation needs him to be at his moral, 
	ethical and administrative best and given that his integrity of character 
	and courage of person have never come under such public focus as of now, he 
	will rise up to the occasion and create a history that will make us proud of 
	him. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The choice is his. He can choose to 
	serve his benefactors and be thrown into the dustbin of history or to serve 
	the nation and be its hero. We hope and pray that he will choose what befits 
	a teacher. </font></p>
