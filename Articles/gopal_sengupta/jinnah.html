	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Well, young man. I will have nothing 
	to do with this pseudo-religious approach to politics. I part company with 
	Congress and Gandhi. I do not believe in working up mob hysteria&quot; The young 
	man was a journalist, Durga Das. The older man was Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The 
	reference is from Durga Das' classic book, India from Curzon to Nehru and 
	After. Jinnah said this after the 1920 Nagpur session, where Gandhi's 
	non-cooperation resolution was passed almost unanimously. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On October 1, 1906, 35 Muslims of 
	&quot;noble birth, wealth, and power&quot; called on the fourth earl of Minto, 
	Curzon's successor as Viceroy of India. They were led by the Aga Khan and 
	used for the first time a phrase that would dominate the history of the 
	subcontinent in the 20th century: the &quot;national interests&quot; of Indian 
	Muslims. They wanted help against an &quot;unsympathetic&quot; Hindu majority. They 
	asked, very politely, for proportional representation in jobs and separate 
	seats in councils, municipalities, university syndicates and high court 
	benches. Lord Minto was happy to oblige. The Muslim League was born in 
	December that year at Dhaka, chaired by Nawab Salimullah Khan, who had been 
	too ill to join the 35 in October. The Aga Khan was its first president.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Aga Khan wrote later that it was 
	&quot;freakishly ironic&quot; that &quot;our doughtiest opponent in 1906&quot; was Jinnah, who 
	&quot;came out in bitter hostility toward all that I and my friends had done ... 
	He was the only well-known Muslim to take this attitude ... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He said that our principle of 
	separate electorates was dividing the nation against itself.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On precisely the same dates that the 
	League was formed in Dhaka, Jinnah was in nearby Calcutta with 44 other 
	Muslims and roughly 1,500 Hindus, Christians, and Parsis, serving as 
	secretary to Dadabhai Naoroji, president of the Indian National Congress. 
	Dadabhai was too ill to give his address, which had been partially drafted 
	by Jinnah and was read out by Gopal Krishna Gokhale. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sarojini Naidu, who met the 
	30-year-old Jinnah for the first time here, remembered him as a symbol of 
	&quot;virile patriotism.&quot; Her description is arguably the best there is: &quot;Tall 
	and stately, but thin to the point of emaciation, languid and luxurious of 
	habit, Mohammad Ali Jinnah's attenuated form is a deceptive sheath of a 
	spirit of exceptional vitality and endurance. Somewhat formal and 
	fastidious, and a little aloof and imperious of manner, the calm hauteur of 
	his accustomed reserve but masks, for those who know him, a naive and eager 
	humanity, an intuition quick and tender as a woman's, a humour gay and 
	winning as child's ... a shy and splendid idealism which is of the very 
	essence of the man.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jinnah entered the central 
	legislative council in Calcutta (the capital of British India then) on 
	January 25, 1910, along with Gokhale, Surendranath Banerjea, and Motilal 
	Nehru. Lord Minto expected the council to rubber stamp &quot;any measures we may 
	deem right to introduce.&quot; Jinnah's maiden speech shattered such pompousness. 
	He rose to defend another Gujarati working for his people in another colony 
	across the seas, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Jinnah expressed &quot;the highest 
	pitch of indignation and horror at the harsh and cruel treatment that is 
	meted out to Indians in South Africa.&quot; Minto objected to a term such as 
	&quot;cruel treatment.&quot; Jinnah responded at once: &quot;My Lord! I should feel much 
	inclined to use much stronger language.&quot; Lord Minto kept quiet. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On March 7, 1911 Jinnah introduced 
	what was to become the first non-official act in British Indian history, the 
	Wakf Validating Bill, reversing an 1894 decision on waqf gifts. Muslims 
	across the Indian empire were grateful. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jinnah attended his first meeting of 
	the League in Bankipur in 1912, but did not become a member. He was in 
	Bankipur to attend the Congress session. When he went to Lucknow a few 
	months later as a special guest of the League (it was not an annual 
	session), Sarojini Naidu was on the platform with him. The bitterness that 
	divided India did not exist then. Dr M.A. Ansari, Maulana Azad and Hakim 
	Ajmal Khan attended the League session of 1914, and in 1915, the League tent 
	had a truly unlikely guest list: Madan Mohan Malviya, Surendranath Banerjea, 
	Annie Besant, B.G. Horniman, Sarojini Naidu and Mahatma Gandhi. When Jinnah 
	did join the League in 1913, he insisted on a condition, set out in 
	immaculate English, that his &quot;loyalty to the Muslim League and the Muslim 
	interest would in no way and at no time imply even the shadow of disloyalty 
	to the larger national cause to which his life was dedicated.&quot; Gokhale that 
	year honoured Jinnah with a phrase that has travelled through time: it is 
	&quot;freedom from all sectarian prejudice which will make him (Jinnah) the best 
	ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity.&quot; In the spring of 1914 Jinnah chaired a 
	Congress delegation to London to lobby Whitehall on a proposed Council of 
	India bill. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Gandhi landed in India in 1915, 
	Jinnah, as president of the Gujarat Society (the mahatmas of both India and 
	Pakistan were Gujaratis), spoke at a garden party to welcome the hero of 
	South Africa. Jinnah was the star of 1915. At the Congress and League 
	sessions, held in Mumbai at the same time, he worked tirelessly with 
	Congress president Satyendra Sinha and Mazharul Haque (a Congressman who 
	presided over the Muslim League that year) for a joint platform of 
	resolutions. Haque and Jinnah were heckled so badly at the League session by 
	mullahs that the meeting had to be adjourned. It reconvened the next day in 
	the safer milieu of the Taj Mahal Hotel. The next year Jinnah became 
	president of the League for the first time, at Lucknow. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Motilal Nehru, in the meantime, 
	worked closely with Jinnah in the council. When the munificent Motilal 
	convened a meeting of fellow-legislators to his handsome mansion in 
	Allahabad in April, he considered Jinnah &quot;as keen a nationalist as any of 
	us. He is showing his community the way to Hindu-Muslim unity.&quot; It was from 
	this meeting in Allahabad that Jinnah went for a vacation to Darjeeling and 
	the summer home of his friend Sir Dinshaw Manockjee Petit (French merchants 
	had nicknamed Dinshaw's small-built grandfather petit and it stuck) and met 
	16-year-old Ruttie. I suppose a glorious view of Everest encouraged romance. 
	When Ruttie became 18 she eloped and on April 19, 1918 they were married. 
	Ruttie's Parsi family disowned her, she separated from Jinnah a decade 
	later. (The wedding ring was a gift from the Raja of Mahmudabad.) </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As president, Jinnah engineered the 
	famous Lucknow Pact with Congress president A.C. Mazumdar. In his 
	presidential speech Jinnah rejoiced that the new spirit of patriotism had 
	&quot;brought Hindus and Muslims together ... </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">for the common cause.&quot; Mazumdar 
	announced that all differences had been settled, and Hindus and Muslims 
	would make a &quot;joint demand for a Representative Government in India.&quot; </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Enter Gandhi, who never entered a 
	legislature, and believed passionately that freedom could only be won by a 
	non-violent struggle for which he would have to prepare the masses. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1915 Gokhale advised Gandhi to 
	keep &quot;his ears open and his mouth shut&quot; for a year, and see India. Gandhi 
	stopped in Calcutta on his way to Rangoon and spoke to students. Politics, 
	he said, should never be divorced from religion. The signal was picked by 
	Muslims planning to marry politics with religion in their first great 
	campaign against the British empire, the Khilafat movement. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Over the next three years Gandhi 
	prepared the ground for his version of the freedom struggle: a shift from 
	the legislatures to the street; a deliberate use of religious imagery to 
	reach the illiterate masses through symbols most familiar to them (Ram Rajya 
	for the Hindus, Khilafat for the Muslims); and an unwavering commitment to 
	the poor peasantry, for whom Champaran became a miracle. The massacre at 
	Jallianwala Bagh in 1919 provided a perfect opportunity; Indian anger 
	reached critical mass. Gandhi led the Congress towards its first mass 
	struggle, the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1921. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The constitutionalist in Jinnah 
	found mass politics ambitious, and the liberal in him rejected the invasion 
	of religion in politics. When he rose to speak at the Nagpur session in 
	1920, where Gandhi moved the non-cooperation resolution, Jinnah was the only 
	delegate to dissent till the end among some 50,000 &quot;surging&quot; Hindus and 
	Muslims. He had two principal objections. The resolution, he said, was a de 
	facto declaration of swaraj, or complete independence, and although he 
	agreed completely with Lala Lajpat Rai's indictment of the British 
	government he did not think the Congress had, as yet, the means to achieve 
	this end; as he put it, &quot;it is not the right step to take at this moment â€¦
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">you are committing the Indian 
	National Congress to a programme which you will not be able to carry out.&quot; 
	(Gandhi, after promising swaraj within a year, withdrew the Non-Cooperation 
	Movement in the wake of communal riots in Kerala and of course the famous 
	Chauri Chaura incident in 1922. Congress formally adopted full independence 
	as its goal only in 1931.) His second objection was that non-violence would 
	not succeed. In this Jinnah was wrong. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is a remarkable sub-text in 
	this speech, which has never been commented upon, at least to my knowledge. 
	When Jinnah first referred to Gandhi, he called him &quot;Mr Gandhi.&quot; There were 
	instant cries of &quot;Mahatma Gandhi.&quot; Without a moment's hesitation, Jinnah 
	switched to &quot;Mahatma Gandhi.&quot; Later, he referred to Mr Mohammad Ali, the 
	more flamboyant of the two Ali Brothers, both popularly referred to as 
	Maulana. There were angry cries of &quot;Maulana.&quot; Jinnah ignored them. He 
	referred at least five times more to Ali, but each time called him only Mr 
	Mohammad Ali. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us leave the last word to 
	Gandhi. Writing in Harijan of June 8, 1940, Gandhi said, &quot;Quaid-e-Azam 
	himself was a great Congressman. It was only after the non-cooperation that 
	he, like many other Congressmen belonging to several communities, left. 
	Their defection was purely political.&quot; In other words, it was not communal. 
	It could not be, for almost every Muslim was with Gandhi when Jinnah left 
	the Congress. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">History might be better understood 
	if we did not treat it as a heroes-and-villains movie. Life is more complex 
	than that. The heroes of our national struggle changed sometimes with 
	circumstances. The reasons for the three instances I cite are very 
	different; their implications radically at variance. I am not making any 
	comparisons, but only noting that leaders change their tactics. Non-violent 
	Gandhi, who broke the empire three decades later, received the Kaiser-I-Hind 
	medal on June 3, 1915 (Tagore was knighted the same day) for recruiting 
	soldiers for the war effort. Subhas Bose, ardently Gandhian in 1920, put on 
	uniform and led the Indian National Army with support from Fascists. Jinnah, 
	the ambassador of unity, became a partitionist. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question that should intrigue us 
	is why. Ambition and frustration are two reasons commonly suggested in 
	India, but they are not enough to create a new nation. Jinnah made the 
	demand for Pakistan only in 1940, after repeated attempts to obtain 
	constitutional safeguards for Muslims and attempts at power-sharing had 
	failed. What happened, for instance, to the Constitution that the Congress 
	was meant to draft in 1928? On the other hand, Congress leaders felt that 
	commitments on the basis of any community would lead to extortion from every 
	community. The only exception made was for Dalits, then called Harijans.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, who 
	remained opposed to partition even after Nehru and Patel had accepted it as 
	inevitable, places one finger on the failed negotiations in United Provinces 
	after the 1936-37 elections, and a second on the inexplicable collapse of 
	the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946 which would have kept India united -- 
	inexplicable because both the Congress and the Muslim League had accepted 
	it. The plan did not survive a press conference given by Nehru. Jinnah 
	responded with the unbridled use of the communal card, and there was no 
	turning back. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A deeply saddened Gandhi spurned 
	August 15, 1947 as a false dawn (to quote Faiz). He spent the day not in 
	celebrations in Delhi but in fasting at Calcutta. Thanks to Gandhi -- and 
	H.S. Suhrawardy -- there were no communal riots in Calcutta in 1947. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Facts are humbling. They prevent you 
	from jumping to conclusions</font>. </p>

			</strong>Strange that one of historyâ€™s cradles, the Indian 
			peninsula, should have so little truck with genuine history, as 
			opposed to myth-making and mythology. Is there any Indian Herodotus? 
			Or Thucydides or Tacitus? One of the richest histories of the world, 
			full of blood, conquest and great achievement without any 
			chronicler, not even an apology of a Gibbon. Before Alberuni who 
			accompanied the armies of Mahmud Ghaznavi, we have the Hindu holy 
			texts, the Upanishads, Kautilyaâ€™s Arthashastra and Megasthenesâ€™ 
			account of the court of Chandragupta Maurya. But nothing that can be 
			credited as historical writing.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Indian history â€” 
			that is, historical writing â€” begins with the coming of the 
			Muslims. This is a remark made not in the spirit of drum-beating 
			because we of the subcontinent are prickly to an inordinate degree, 
			apt to stand on our dignity and pick quarrels about the wrong 
			things, but just a bald statement of fact.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Before the coming of 
			the British it was but dimly understood in India that the birthplace 
			of Buddhism was India, that the divine Siddharta was a prince of 
			India, not of any faraway land. So complete was the extermination of 
			Buddhism from India in the early centuries of the last millennium 
			that the fact that such a faith had once existed and indeed 
			flourished ceased to form part of Indiaâ€™s historical memory.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Muslim historians â€” 
			for the most part court historians â€” sang the praises of their own 
			kings. Except for Alberuni, they had little interest in the India 
			that had existed before them. Theirs are contemporary accounts, not 
			explorations of the past. It was the European arrival in India which 
			spurred interest in Indian studies and, in time, through scholars 
			such as Max Mueller who translated the Upanishads laid the basis of 
			the Hindu revivalist movement which grew towards the end of the 19th 
			century.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Two conclusions 
			arise: firstly, about the poverty of Indian historiography; 
			secondly, about the lack of a developed historical sense as late as 
			the second half of the 19th century.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Given this poverty of 
			history-writing, is it any wonder if history has a strong parochial 
			bias in both India and Pakistan, with scholars on both sides of the 
			divide viewing the confused and tumultuous events of the first half 
			of the 20th century, culminating in the partition of India, through 
			their own rose-tinted or hate-filled glasses?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">True, the 
			black-and-white approach to history is more securely ensconced in 
			Pakistan than in India, Pakistanis glorifying their champions and 
			refusing to see any fault in them while demonising the Indian side 
			completely. India, by contrast, has produced a better tradition of 
			historical writing. Even so, the biases and prejudices which rise to 
			the surface when, say, the birth of Pakistan or the role of Jinnah 
			is discussed, continue to be breathtaking.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Small wonder then if 
			there has been such a storm in the dovecotes of the Hindu right 
			because of L.K. Advaniâ€™s not flattering but fair remarks about 
			M.A. Jinnah during his Pakistan visit. What did Advani say? That ... 
			&quot;his (Jinnahâ€™s) address to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 
			August 11, 1947 is a classic, a forceful espousal of a secular state 
			in which every citizen would be free to practise his own religion 
			but the state shall make no distinction between one citizen and 
			another on the grounds of faith.&quot; Since this is no more than the 
			truth, why such a reaction in India?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Because the image of 
			Jinnah thus evoked runs counter to his demonising which has been 
			standard fare in India since 1947. Every child in India is brought 
			up on the belief that Jinnah played the communal card by invoking 
			the two-nation theory and this is what led to the break-up of Mother 
			India. Itâ€™s a good line as far as selective history goes, but 
			nowhere near the truth.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Jinnah was a leading 
			light of the Congress, a figure on the Indian stage before Gandhi 
			arrived in India from South Africa. That he was a staunch 
			nationalist who stood uncompromisingly for Indian freedom goes 
			without saying. What Indians of this generation find hard to 
			understand is that far from being a communalist, he abhorred any 
			intrusion of religion into politics. And it was on this very point 
			that his differences with Gandhi first arose.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">For what Gandhi did 
			when he took up the mantle of Congress leadership was to bring to 
			the politics of mass mobilisation words and slogans steeped in Hindu 
			symbolism. What was the objective of the freedom struggle? The 
			setting up of Ram Raj. How on earth could Muslims be expected to 
			rally to such a call? (Though rejecting this objective of 'Ram Raj', 
			it is worth mentioning here that Ramayana is read by more people in 
			Indonesia than it is in India as&nbsp;I found out while living there for 
			four years!!&nbsp; The subject of Indian Muslims not interested in 
			India's heritage is probably a mis-representation or Muslim 
			middle-class distortion of reality? Any comments? - TS)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">The Muslim demand as 
			articulated most ably by Jinnah was that Hindus and Muslims, before 
			anything else, represented two distinct communities, each with their 
			different outlook on life. The recognition of this reality far from 
			dividing the nationalist movement would strengthen it by bringing 
			Muslims and Hindus under a common flag of struggle.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">That Hindus and 
			Muslims were two communities was not something invented by Jinnah, 
			as most Indians would like to believe, but a simple recognition of 
			reality. Hindus and Muslims did not become two communities in the 
			19th or 20th centuries. They were two communities, and remained as 
			such, from the moment the first Muslim set foot on Indian soil.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">This was a truth best 
			captured by Nirad Chaudhri in his Autobiography of An Unknown 
			Indian, one of the most perceptive observers of the Indian 
			condition, and perhaps for this very reason not universally loved in 
			India. He writes: &quot;When I see the gigantic catastrophe of 
			Hindu-Muslim discord of these days I am not surprised, because we as 
			children held the tiny mustard seed in our hands and sowed it very 
			diligently. In fact, this conflict was implicit in the very 
			unfolding of our history, and could hardly be avoided. Heaven 
			preserve me from the dishonesty, so general among Indians, of 
			attributing this conflict to British rule, however much the foreign 
			rulers might have profited by it. Indeed they would have been 
			excusable only as gods, and not as man the political animal, had 
			they made no use of the weapon so assiduously manufactured by us, 
			and by us also put into their hands. But even then they did not make 
			use of it to the extent they might easily have done. This, I know, 
			is a very controversial thesis, but I think it can be very easily 
			proved if we do not turn a blind eye to the facts of our history.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">The Muslims of India 
			did not begin with the demand for Pakistan. Indeed, before 1940 only 
			a few hotheads or political dilettantes spoke about it. Even Iqbal 
			in his famous Allahabad address spoke about a special dispensation 
			for Indian Muslims &quot;within&quot; not without the framework of a united 
			India. Haunted by the fear of being swamped by a Hindu majority â€” 
			fears which the more questionable tenets of Hindu revivalism did 
			nothing to dissipate â€” they wanted to be recognised as a separate 
			community entitled to special constitutional safeguards. (Not all 
			that strange a demand if we consider the constitutional dispensation 
			in force in a country like Lebanon.) Only on the Congressâ€™ refusal 
			to accept this point of view, did the Muslim League leadership, very 
			late in the day, move towards the demand for Pakistan.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Along the way there 
			were other slip-ups. In the words of Ram Gopal whose Indian Muslims 
			should be a must read for students of that period, &quot;When the 
			Congress decided to accept office (in the UP after the 1937 
			elections) and proceeded with its ministry-making efforts, the 
			League put forward its claim for a share on the strength of its 
			pre-election understanding with the Congress. There were prolonged 
			negotiations between the leaders of the two bodies, but there was no 
			workable arrangement reached. It was one of the most fateful and 
			distressing failures in the political history of India; it gave 
			strength to the belief, held by some adventurous Muslim leaders, 
			that the Muslims should have a separate homeland.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">What most Indians of 
			this generation do not realise, or havenâ€™t been told with enough 
			emphasis, is that as late as 1946 the Muslim League leadership 
			accepted the Cabinet Mission plan envisaging a united India. The 
			Congress too accepted it before Nehru went back on the Congressâ€™ 
			committed word by introducing fresh reservations which wrecked the 
			accord.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Maulana Azadâ€™s 
			India Wins Freedom gives one of the best accounts of this episode. 
			In vain did he plead with his colleagues to accept the Cabinet 
			Mission plan which would have preserved a united India. Patel and 
			Nehru were adamant. Accepting the plan would have meant compromising 
			with the Muslim League which they were not prepared to accept. 
			Towards the end, it was not the Muslim League but the Congress which 
			was hell-bent on partition.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Did Jinnah and the 
			Muslim League not play the communal card in the 1946 elections? They 
			did, the battle-cry of the League in those elections was the slogan, 
			&quot;Muslim hai to Muslim League mein aa (if you are a Muslim come to 
			the Muslim League).&quot; But the dragonâ€™s teeth had been sown much 
			before and the fire spouting as a result led not only to partition 
			but one of the worst orgies of plunder, rape and blood-letting in 
			the history of the 20th century.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Whoâ€™s to blame? 
			Jinnah or a massive failure of understanding on the part of the 
			Congress leadership? Not that Pakistanis regret partition. Far from 
			it. It would, however, help if with the calming of the storms 
			accompanying partition we could somehow arrive at a more judicious 
			writing of history.</font></span></div>
