	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A well known 
	journalist of multifarious profession, self proclaimed Marxist politician, 
	though never been a member of any Marxism based political party, breathed 
	his last in Torento General Hospital at Canada, where he was being treated 
	on cancer affected liver, on 10<sup>th</sup> November at about 9-20 a.m. 
	local time. He had been suffering from liver cancer for the last one year 
	and being operated twice in the same hospital. He was 66 and left behind his 
	wife, a daughter, and two sons. He married more than once. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Khan led a 
	colorful life and quite popular among the left oriented politicians, 
	anti-Indian political parties right and left equally. He himself, through 
	out his life, was an ardent critic of India, whoever assumed the state power 
	there, Awami League and its leader Sheikh Mujib, CPB, and NAP (Muzaffar). He 
	had little respect for veteran communist leader Mani Singh. He, with many of 
	co-thinkers, used to call CPB, Mani Singh and NAP (Muzaffar) as ‘B teams’ of 
	AL and agents of Soviet reformative and Indian Expansionism, two popular 
	terms used among the pro-Mao and ultra left followers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At times he 
	appeared to be extreme anti Hindu and anti secularism- which brought him 
	closer to Islamic fundamentalists who often thought that Enayetullah was 
	their man. He was in fact very close to present BNP government, although not 
	directly associated with the party, maintaining a respectable distance. He 
	was definitely a clever and intelligent man, being considered a man nearer 
	to Begum Zia.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Born on 25<sup>th</sup> 
	May, 1939 in a elite family Mr. Khan obtained his M. A. degree in Philosophy 
	from Dacca University in 1960. During his student life he was an activist 
	student leader; though kept close link with all progressive student 
	political parties he was never a member of any of those parties. He was 
	general secretary of Mymensingh College union in 1958-59 and was elected VP 
	of Dacca Hall union in 1959-60. He started his journalist career as a 
	reporter of the then ‘Pakistan Observer’ (now Bangladesh Observer) after his 
	student career. In 1965 he started a weekly newspaper ‘Holiday’ in English 
	under his editorship, which become quite popular among the upper class.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am not sure 
	what was his role during nine month of our war of liberation. Certainly he 
	never claimed himself to be a freedom fighter, rather was very critical of 
	AL’s role during 1971 when entire nation was fighting the barbarous 
	Pakistanis from outside or from within. His enemies says that during those 
	critical days he maintained a close relation with Mr. Zufiqar Ali Bhutto and 
	his party PPP. After the liberation when AL formed government with Sheikh 
	Mujibur as PM, Holiday became a vehement critic of AL and Bangabandhu Sheikh 
	Mujibur Rahman, the architect of Bangladesh, which Enayetullah never 
	admitted. Holiday became the champion of upholding the cause of Albadars and 
	Razakars in the name of returning stranded Bengalese in Pakistan. He even 
	posed a question ‘Sixty millions collaborators ?’ in his Holiday. </font>
	</p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the 
	gruesome assassination of Bangabandhu, he and his Holiday was visibly 
	jubilant and extended support to killer Mustaq Ahmed and his Surya-Santans 
	Faruqh, Rashid, Dalim, Pasha and gang. He wrote an article on Bangabandhu 
	published by the then weekly Vichitra, edited by Shahadat Choudhury, which 
	clearly exposed his inner mind, his attitude towards India, Hindus and AL.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the fall 
	of Mustaq Ahmed and rise of Major General Zia, following the so called Sepoy 
	Revolution of 7<sup>th</sup> November, 1975 Enayetullah played a significant 
	role from behind. He became very close to Zia with many other left 
	politicians like Zadu Mian, Kazi Zafar etc.. belonging to once NAP Bhasani. 
	Many say he played a key role in ousting Col Taher and JSD from the helm of 
	affairs. Ultimately he became a minister of natural resources etc. in Zia 
	cabinet during 1977-78. From 1984-89 he served as an ambassador in China, 
	North Korea, Cambodia and Myanmar. This assignment, not being a seasoned 
	politician or a career diplomat, clearly points out how close he was to 
	General Zia, President of Bangladesh. With the death of Zia, he somehow fell 
	from grace as newer competitors and new faces in BNP politics appeared who 
	are more active with slogan ‘Action, action, direct action’. Surely 
	sophisticated Enayetullah was a misfit to new setup under PM Begum Khaleda, 
	widow of General Zia. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not even being a 
	fulltime politician, he enjoyed all the benefits that were due to seasoned 
	politicians. Here lies the credit and intelligence of Enayetullah Khan. 
	Never belonging to any socialism or communism based parties in BD, nor 
	involving himself any peasant, labor or any revolutionary movement he was 
	regarded as a Marxist or even a Communist. This reflects how clever and 
	meritorious, possessing maneuvering capability, was he as a man. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Personally, we 
	have never been close to each other, al though I contributed articles in his 
	Holiday when I was deeply involved in sixty-nine mass movement that 
	ultimately followed non-cooperation movement culminating into war of 
	liberation. Politically, we were miles away from each other. But 
	nevertheless he possessed a charming personality with whom you can talk and 
	argue, never being bored or annoyed. But I always discovered in him a hidden 
	but sophisticated communalism. This was his limitation, or might be this was 
	his ideology – ‘Moslem Marxism’, I don’t know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Needless to say, 
	late Enayetullah Khan was surely a colorful personality in our 
	socio-political society. Surely he enjoyed his life thoroughly. Let us pay 
	our tribute to the departed soul, who tried to serve Bangladesh in his own 
	style and conception, with which we may or may not agree. Be peace on him.
