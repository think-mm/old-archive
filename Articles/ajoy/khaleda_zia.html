	<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The inevitable has happened 
	– at long last the grand Queen of Bangladesh, Begum Saheba, widow of 
	ex\president general Ziaur Rahman, twice prime minister of Bangladesh, 
	Chairperson of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has been arrested from her 
	cantonment resident in the early morning of September 3, 2007at around 5-30 
	a.m. The arrest followed a case filed by one deputy secretary of Anti 
	Corruption Commission at Tejgaon Police station at 11-30 p.m. on September 
	2, 2007. &nbsp;</p>
	<h1 style="text-align:justify"><b><font size="3">Yet another drama staged at 
	the cantonment residence of Begum Khaleda</font></b></h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Our disciplined force has a 
	strong histrionic sense, many a times they displayed it very beautifully. At 
	midnight of September 2, police force encircled the residence of Khaleda 
	Begum in a dramatic fashion. Around 3-30 morning the discipline forces 
	reinforced it with police and few platoons of RAB; the warrant of arrest was 
	sent inside to Begum Khaleda, who said that she needed some time. At 5-30 
	a.m. the discipline force entered her residence and arrested the queen and 
	her younger son Prince Arafat Rahman Koko. Both the arrestees were then 
	taken to CMM court around 8 am in the following morning&nbsp;&nbsp; escorted by not 
	less than fifty microbuses, cars and special jeeps, pajeras, police vehicles 
	etc, a royal procession indeed. She was then produced before the CMM 
	magistrate court, which rejected the bail petition and issued an order to 
	sent Ex PM Begum Zia to jail. She as well as her lawyers pleaded not guilty 
	and termed the case of corruption filed against her as conspiratory in 
	nature. She was then brought to a special jail in Sangsad Bhavan area. In 
	fact the residence of the speaker has been named as special jail. What a 
	luxurious jail. There should not be any problem for ex PM because it is a 
	mere change of residence only. As the jail authority said that residence is 
	a VIP residence furnished with modern furniture and equipped with all modern 
	facilities including TV, Friz etc, except perhaps she would not have the 
	necessary facilities for teleconference with her followers and admirers. But 
	don’t worry madam has many admirers inside the jail as well government 
	administration. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Government of Dr. 
	Fakhruddin Ahmed, skillfully advised and guided by army generals, took long 
	seven months to put Begum Zia, Prime minister of most corrupted and worst 
	government in the history of BD, which led Bangladesh to the status of 
	failed state. The most talkative adviser Barrister Moinul Husain said that 
	the arrest of Begum Zia is not an act of balance, she was arrested on the 
	basis of specific charges brought against her by the anti corruption 
	commission. He claimed that his government is strictly neutral in this 
	matter. This brought a hundred dollar question among the interested circle - 
	is the action taken against Begum Khaleda is just an eyewash? Why BD 
	government took so long a time- from whose clearance they were waiting for? 
	We do not know. Only the time knows the answer. </p>

	<font size="3">It is alleged that in collusion with other 13 co-accused 
	including her younger son Arafat Rahman Koko she arranged to give contract 
	to a relatively inexperience contractor farm named ‘GATO’ for handling 
	Container Depot at Chittagong port and Internal Container Depot (ICD) at 
	Kamalapur. It is further alleged that the proprietor (?) of the GATO 
	happened to be son of an important BNP leader, Minister of Sea and 
	Navigation affairs Col. (retired) late Akbar Hosain. As a result the 
	government had incurred a loss of not less than Taka one thousand crores.

	Musa Kajol and Ehsan Yusuf. It is learnt that the incident took place some 
	time March 2003. It is said that original tenders, being not up to the 
	standard it was decided by the fir fresh tenders. But it’s rumored that the 
	then PM intervened and without showing any reason unilaterally gave order to 
	the GATO. It is further rumored that Mr. Saymon was the negotiator in this 
	matter between the GATO and PM via Koko. Koko demanded crores of rupees for 
	the purpose from Saymon, who it is alleged that Saymon obtained more than 
	two crores taka from the company most of which he had given to Koko. How far 
	this story is correct it is the anti corruption secretariat to substantiate 
	at the court. Till then let us keep our fingers crossed. </font></span></h1>
