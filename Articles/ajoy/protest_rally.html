										Shiksha Andolan Mancha yesterday (7<sup>th</sup> 
										September) held a protest rally in front 
										of the ‘Swoparjita Swadhina’ (the 
										sculpture depicting wining of 
										Independence by ourselves erected by 
										Shamim Shikdar in a triangular park in 
										front of the Teachers Students Centre-TSC<font size="2">)</font> 
										condemning the uncivilized utterances 
										and threat of life made by the Shibir, 
										the student front of Jamat against one 
										of our popular and well known literary 
										personality (novelist and short story 
										writer) and professor of Philosophy of 
										Rajshahi University, now retired, Syed 
										Hasan Azizul Haque, and Dr. Zarar Iqbal, 
										Professor of Department of Computer 
										Science, Shah Jalal University, Sylhel--also 
										a popular science fiction writer. </p>
										<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
										The protest meeting, presided over by 
										Professor Ajoy Roy was addressed by five 
										student leaders belonging to five 
										progressive student organizations 
										including Chhatra Front, Biplobi Chhatra 
										Moitri, Chhatra Union, Samajtantrik 
										Chhatra Front and among others Mr. Obaed 
										Ferdous, Assoc. Professor, Department of 
										Journalism, DU,&nbsp; Professor Shahidul 
										Islam, Syed Abul Kalam, MM Akash, 
										Lecturer, Asia Pacific University, et 
										al. </p>
										<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
										In his presidential address Professor 
										Roy pointed out that threat of life and 
										declaring <i>murtads</i> to our learned 
										and important personalities of our 
										national life by the fundamentalists who 
										wants to make Bangladesh a<i> taleban</i> 
										style Islamic State of Afghanistan or 
										Pakistani Model is not a new phenomenon. 
										We are accustomed to their threats and 
										activities since fifties while “I was 
										student in the University”. They have 
										killed in recent past Professor Eunus of 
										Rajshahi University, Professor Taher of 
										the same university. This evil force 
										couple of years back fatally injured 
										with an attempt to murder Dr. Humayun 
										Azad that ultimately led to his untimely 
										death. The same force killed Principal 
										Muhury of Chittagong, burnt alive seven 
										Hindu family members in Bashkhali, 
										Chittagong. Professor Roy made a 
										clarinet call to fight against this 
										anti-people, anti-democracy evil force 
										of communalism and religious 
										fundamentalism. He urged upon the young 
										progressive elements to get united 
										forgetting their party line difference 
										against the common enemy of secularism, 
										civil liberty and liberalism that has 
										now become a real threat to the very 
										existence of free and liberal 
										Bangladesh. Dr. Roy assured Professor 
										Hasan Azizul Haque and Dr Zarar Iqbal 
										that they will always find him and his 
										organization with them. He call upon the 
										law agency forces and the government 
										machineries to take appropriate and 
										stern action who are relenetlessly 
										thraeting the great sons of 
										Bangladesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
										<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
										After the rally, a procession was 
										brought out that paraded around the 
										campus chanting full throated slogans in 
										favour of secularism, liberalism 
										democracy, secular education and down 
										with Jamat and similar anti-people 
										forces. The rally ended at the feet of 
										the Shahid Minar where Mr. MM Akash, the 
										secretary general of Shiksha Andolan 
										Mancha thanked the participants for 
										making the function a success. The 
										protesters made a promise to stand 
										behind Professor Hasan and Iqbal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

										Both Hasan and Zarar Iqbal are quite 
										known to me while Zarar Iqbal was a 
										student of mine in physics department in 
										early seventies, Professor Hasan Azizul 
										Haque is a very good friend, and a co 
										fighter against fundamentalism and 
										communalism. Both are known for their 
										liberal views, and quite popular. The 
										Shiksha Andolan Mancha has lunched a 
										secular movement throughout Bangladesh 
										holding seminars, rallies, human chain 
										formations etc with a view to make the 
										country back to its secular status and 
										introduce a secular education system. In 
										this series we held a seminar at 
										Rajshahi.</p>
										<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="justify">
										As you know by this time that on 18<sup>th</sup> 
										August a seminar was arranged by Shiksha 
										Andolan Mancha, Rajshahi unit, on 
										“Secularism, State and Education”. The 
										seminar was presided over by Professor 
										Hasan Azizul Haque, also the convener of 
										Shiksha Andolan Mancha, Rajshahi unit. 
										More than 300 audience, mostly students 
										attended the seminar held at Rajshahi 
										University campus. Among others 
										Professor Shahidul Islam of Rajshahi 
										University, Vice President of Shiksha 
										Andolan Mancha and Professor Abidur Reza 
										of Mymensingh Agriculture University and 
										some students spoke at the seminar. The 
										speakers raised their voices in favour 
										of a secular state, secular society and 
										secular education policy. The speakers 
										pointed out that secularism is closely 
										connected with humanism and human rights 
										and liberalism. After the speeches 
										delivered by the speakers a lively open 
										discussion followed. Many relevant 
										questions were raised from the audience 
										to which the learned speakers and the 
										president replied. Neither tension nor 
										any unpleasant events took place. It was 
										a most lively and successful seminar, 
										opined many who were there. In his 
										presidential speech Hasan Azizul Haque 
										spoke very eloquently on secularism, and 
										why we need a secular state, a secular 
										society and a secular education. He 
										emphatically said that the English term
										<i>religion</i> and the Bengali term 
										‘Dharma’, are not synonymous. The later 
										term means whatever property an object 
										holds or a view an individual or a 
										society cherishes is a <i>dharma</i>, 
										which has nothing to do with religion or 
										the creator and creation. If one 
										believes in `God and the doctrine that 
										Universe is His creation’- this belief 
										is his dharma; equally if one does not 
										have faith in the existence of God, then 
										this non-belief (known as nastikata in 
										Bangla, atheism) is the dharma of that 
										gentleman. Both these views have 
										anything to do with that state affairs 
										or the government, which is currently 
										managing the state. But the state will 
										see that the believer and the 
										non-believer both get the protection of 
										the state if one’s view is attacked by 
										the other. In the eye of the state and 
										the state laws all citizens are equal 
										irrespective of whether they follow the 
										doctrines of Muhammad, or of Krishna or 
										of Buddha or the Son of God, no matter. 
										If the state allows one religionists to 
										preach their views, it should then allow 
										others to do the same including the 
										views of the atheists, or the state 
										would not allow anyone to preach his 
										belief. This is what the secularism 
										stands for. Professor Hasan in his 
										speech precisely said this to his 
										enthusiastic audience who applauded him 
										time and again as he was continuing. As 
										I know him he is a charming personality 
										with good oratory skill who can take his 
										audience with him. This was not to be 
										liked by the Jamatis that Hasan had so 
										much charming influence over his young 
										audience. But this was not the end. 
										Hasan pointed out that today’s problem 
										is not who believes or who does not 
										belief in God- the real threat is the 
										terrorism and it springs out from 
										religious fanaticism of Islam. Lovers of 
										Islam either failed to suppress it or 
										they have the approval. But root problem 
										is the exploitation; so long 
										exploitation continues Bangladesh could 
										not be made a secular state. He pointed 
										out that throughout the history of 
										civilization religion played a 
										significant role in exploitation of 
										common mass. Hasan warned his audience 
										that so long we couldn’t make 
										ineffective the hand of exploitation of 
										religion, sufferings of common mass of 
										Bangladesh will continue.</p>
										<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify" align="justify">
										Contents and spirit of his speech&nbsp; was 
										intentionally corrupted and misreported 
										by the fundamentalist group. A story was 
										made in Jamati daily, <i>Naya Diganta</i> 
										on the following day. It quoted many a 
										points out of context intentionally to 
										prove the choef religious sentiments. 
										The Shibir students who has virtually 
										made the RU campus under their seize for 
										some time past brought out a procession 
										inside the campus on 19<sup>th</sup> 
										August burning his effigy, and calling 
										him a <i>murtad</i> with filthy 
										language. </p>
