	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><b>The call of surrender</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">That 
	was the repeated call of the then General Manekshaw, Army Chief of the 
	Indian Military, to Pakistani soldiers fighting against Mitrabahini in the 
	occupied territory of East Pakistan during the period 12-15the December 1971 
	as the Indian Army and Bangladesh army hand in hand penetrating deeper and 
	deeper in Bangladesh territory In the mean while well fortified Jessore 
	garrison fell in 7<sup>th</sup> December without serious fight by the 
	Pakistanis. Mitrabahini and Bangladesh Army were fast approaching Dacca, the 
	capital of Bangladesh, last fortress of General Neazi, commander of the 
	Pakistan Army in Eastern front from all sides west, north, north east. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	strategy of the combined force was to offer least resistance to well 
	fortified position of Pakistani army, such as Hilly, Comilla Cantonment etc 
	and by pass those strong holds and rush to Dacca. However the resistance 
	offered by Pakistanis on way of advancement of the Mitrabahini was totally 
	and drastically wiped out. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">At 
	this stage General Manekshaw opened a psychological war front to further 
	demoralize the morale and courage of fighting spirit of the already 
	demoralized Pakistani soldiers by calling Neazi and his soldiers to 
	surrender to the combined India-Bangladesh force in eastern front. The call 
	was `surrender unconditionally’ to Mitrabahini immediately. In Urdu the call 
	was simply `Hatiar dal do’. General Manekshaw assured the Pakistani 
	occupation force that their lives and security would be guaranteed and 
	Geneva convention would be applied to POWs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Field 
	Marshal Manekshaw was a great friend of Bangladesh. But his professionalism 
	has never been overshadowed by sentiments and emotion. He was a cool 
	thoughtful man and wonderful military strategist, totally committed to his 
	professionalism as military personnel. The following narration illustrates 
	his strict principle of professionalism and &nbsp;capability of distance vision. 
	In an interview in 1996, he disclosed that some time in mid April General 
	was summoned in a cabinet meeting attended by apart from PM Indira, Jagjivan 
	Ram (defence minister), Sardar Sharan Singh (foreign minister) and Y, B. 
	Chyavan (finance minister). At that time a large number of refugees started 
	pouring in Tripura, Asam and West Bengal. PM Indira, showing a telegram of 
	chief minister of Assam that expressed concern over it and if some thing 
	positive was not done to prevent the refugee flux, a grave situation might 
	develop in north-east region of India that might go beyond the control of 
	the state government, asked the General `What are you doing ?’ Sam replied, 
	`nothing’, and what am I to do?’ PM said that the government wanted that you 
	march in. Sam’ rely was vey amusing and materialistic at the same time. This 
	meant a war against Pakistan. ‘Are you ready ? Honestly speaking I am not.’ 
	‘In a few weeks time, monsoon will set in Bangladesh would turn into an 
	ocean. And you can not move not to speak of fighting fortified Pakistanis’, 
	continued the General., ‘we wiill be restricted to only land roads. The Air 
	force will be of little use.’ In such a condition we cannot win against 
	Pakistanis. More over our armament division is not fully equipped for 
	shortage of tanks’, was the straight answer of Manekshaw. When the meeting 
	was over and all left, PM asked to Sam to sit down. Sam thought that PM 
	probably got annoyed with him and would ask him to resign. On the contrary 
	PM asked him if that what he said were the true picture. Manekshaw convinced 
	Indira that not only militarily, but even the condition and people were not 
	prepared, the international situation was also not in India’s favour in 
	marching against Pakistan at this stage. He then point balank asked the PM, 
	‘Are you yourself prepared Prime Minister?’ He finally concluded to PM, ‘My 
	job is to win a war. And I want to do this in my opportune time when every 
	thing would be in our favour. I give you hundred percent assurance of 
	victory. He concluded by saying, ‘But I need unitary command.’ No body will 
	interfere with your actions, assured Indira Gandhi. Thanking Indiara Sam 
	said, ‘I give you hundred percent guarantee of our success.’ This was Sam 
	Manekshaw.&nbsp; &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Field 
	Marshal was suffering from lung problem and some old age complexity. A few 
	days back he was taken to in Wellington Military hospital in Tamilnadu in a 
	stage of coma, where he breathed his last on last Friday morning, June 27, 
	2008. He was 94. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	General Manekshaw was the main architect of planning the India Pakistan war 
	in western front and India-Bangladesh vs. Pakistan in eastern front i.e. in 
	occupied Bangladesh. In this grand strategy theory of by passing strongholds 
	of Pakistani and rushing fast to Dacca’s fall like a roped mango posts that 
	will panic the Pakistani forces and would have no option but to surrender 
	Manekshaw was the chief architect in which PM of India and PM of Bangladesh 
	and military strategist led by Air Vice Marshall AK Khandakar all 
	contributed. Manekshaw clearly stated the PM Indira Gandhi, PM Tajuddin and 
	military leadership of Bangladesh that if we want to win the war against 
	Pakistan the military force of Indian army in eastern command under Lt Gen. 
	Jagjit Singh Aurora and Bangladesh army including the guerillas must be 
	brought under a unified joint command. The joint will force a defeat on the 
	demoralized and already harassed Pakistani occupation force by the 
	guerillas. The defeat in East Pakistan would a sure victory in western front 
	too. How prophetic he was. With the surrender of Pakistanis in eastern front 
	the Indian government declared unilateral ceasefire in western front. And 
	defeated Pakistanis readily accepted it without murmuring that `we will 
	fight for thousand years, even if have to chew grass. The end of war came 
	within 13 days and Bangladesh emerged as a free independent state. What a 
	glorious victory for all of us, the Bengalis, the Indians and the people of 
	the world who morally and materially supported the cause of Bangladesh. Sam 
	Manekshaw must have been the happiest man in the world. He shared the glory 
	of liberating a country with his proud Indian army colleagues particularly 
	hose who were involved in the eastern front including the chief of joint 
	command Lt. Gen. Jagjit Sing Aurora. Jagjit and Sam both our great friends 
	in our crisis are no more with us, but their memory will remain ever green 
	in our memory century after century. &nbsp;</font></p>

	Brief sketch of the Field Marshal&nbsp;</b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Manekshaw was awarded the highest military title of Indian army, the Field 
	Marshall in 1973. He was also decorated with civil award `Padma Bibhusan’ He 
	was popularly known as Sam Bahadur, who joined Indian army in 1934. His 
	bravery was mythical in war fields. During his long military career he 
	showed infinite courage in five wars. He also took part in the Second World 
	War as a member of the British Army in Burma front. He was decorated with 
	military cross for his glorious role in Burma front. He became army chief of 
	Indian army in 1969. He retired from Indian Army as field Marshall in 
	January 15, 1973. Manekshaw was born in 1914 in Amritsar in Punjab. His full 
	name was Sam Hormushji Fremji Jamshedji Manekshaw. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>
	Personal remembrance&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">I saw 
	the general perhaps some time in end of July, 1971 in Fort William, the 
	military head quarter of the eastern front, Calcutta. He held a press 
	conference with the foreign and Indian journalists. Some Bangladeshi 
	journalists were also invited. A few Bangladeshi intellectuals among whom 
	myself, as secretary of Bangladesh Teachers Assocation and Dr, Belayet 
	Hosain, joint secretary of Liberation Council of Bangladesh Intelligentsia 
	and Dr. Mozaharul Haque, Professor of Bengali, Rajshahi University and few 
	others, I don’t remember now. were also invited at the press conference as 
	the general wanted exchange views on Bangladesh problems with some 
	Bangladesh intellectuals after the press conference. The invitation was sent 
	through the office of the Vice Chancellor, Calcutta University, who was the 
	president CU Bangladesh Sahayak Samity, a sister organization of ours, as 
	Bangladesh Teachers Association’s office was at the Dwarbhanga Building. 
	Prof. Dilip Chakaravorty, secretary of CU Bangladesh Sahayak Samity 
	accompanied us to Fort William. We were intercepted at the entrance of the 
	conference room for pass, which we didn’t have. We identified ourselves that 
	General intends to meet us after the conference. We were politely asked to 
	wait, and five minutes later the same man in uniform took us to a specified 
	area in the second row where I found Dr. Mazharul Haque and some others. The 
	conference has already started a few minutes back. I saw many high military 
	officials were sitting in the first row, among whom Lt. Gen. Aurora was also 
	there, a tall slim hand some man in uniform. I saw Lt. Gen Aurora too when 
	Prof Chakravorty showed me. He was tall and slim having impressive 
	appearance. The room was crowded with hosts of journalists. Most questions 
	were of military nature and Indian army’s plan and what would be its 
	military strategy in case Bangladesh’s liberation war turned into India’s 
	war against Pakistanr. I found the general most intelligent and pragmatic 
	man. He ruled out the possibility of Indo Pakistan war on Bangladesh issue. 
	He point blank said that `I don't think Pakistani military would be that 
	foolish to force war on us. Then it would be a disastrous for Pakistan, but 
	Indian people would have to be prepared for extreme sacrifice. He added to a 
	Bangladesh journalist, that ‘it is your war; you have to fight it out. Under 
	the circumstances we could help you only as your friend and well wisher. The 
	policy our government adopts we, would follow to materialize.’ Regarding a 
	question of recognition to Bangladesh government by India he plainly said, 
	as far as I remember, it is a political matter and Indian military has 
	nothing to do it. The long press conference when ended, a man in uniform 
	announced that because of general’s time constrain he could not meet the 
	Bangladesh intellectuals for which he apologized. We stood up in 
	disappointment. The general waved his hand towards us saying `my apology. We 
	will meet some time later.’ That some time later never came. Alas !.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
