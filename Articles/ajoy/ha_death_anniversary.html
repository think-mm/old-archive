	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dhaka observed 
	late Dr. Humayun Azad’s first death anniversary. On this occasion daily 
	Sangbad brought out a special page yesterday (11<sup>th</sup> August) 
	containing three articles: ‘<i>Humayun Azad ebang lekhaker swadhinata</i>’(Humayun 
	Azad and Independence of a writer)&nbsp; by Janab Mohammad Ali, ‘<i>Amar baba 
	Humayun Azad</i>’ (My father, Humayun Azad)&nbsp; by Mouli Azad, ‘<i>Humayun Azad 
	o Asamapta Galpaguli</i>’ (Humayun Azad and unfinished stories)&nbsp;&nbsp; by Jemine 
	Buli and ‘<i>Nisanga Yoddha : Humayun Azad</i> ‘ (Lone Fighter : Humayun 
	Azad) by Azizul Haque.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mouli Azad 
	recollects her sweet memory of her brave father giving life fighting against 
	communalism, fundamentalism and all sorts of narrowness. It touches everyone 
	who goes through this article when she said, “…. Any way, on all a sudden 
	the word (Baba) that vanished away from my life for good, is the great 
	unconventional writer, poet, Professor and what not of Bangladesh. The media 
	began to reveal that in his demise Bangladesh lost a great writer, and a 
	vacuum had been created in the arena of Bengali literature and so many 
	things were being written about him. But the deep wound or an unbound void 
	that was created in the life of a daughter – who cares about it ? No media 
	did ever want to know about it .“ “ I don’t know if the void created in the 
	Bengali literature by his death would ever be filled up, but I know for sure 
	the void in my heart would never be filled by anyone.”, continues Mouli.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hasan Azizul 
	Haque in his article pictured Humayun Azad a lone fighter against all sorts 
	of wrongs and many vices of our society including obscurantism, communalism 
	and religious fanaticism. Azizul Haque described feelings of Dr. Azad’s pain 
	and agony against our society when he quotes from his famous poem ‘Sab 
	Kichhu Nasthader Adhikare yabe’. Janab Haque discovers in the writings of 
	Azad the story of defeatism of all good at the hand of evils. He identifies 
	this as the characteristic of Azad’s writing opining that this might have 
	been the weapon of fighting of Dr. Humayun Azad. Perhaps he wanted to whip 
	the sentiments of our common mass so that one-day they would revolt against 
	the evils, opined Azizul Haque. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jesmine Buli 
	revealed many untold stories of last days of Humayun Azad while he was in 
	Germany for a week or so in her article “Humayun Azad and Unfinished 
	Stories”. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bhorer Kagoj also 
	brought today (August 12, 2005) a supplement on Dr. Azad that contains three 
	articles namely – <i>Manabadhikar o Lekhaker Swadhinata</i> (Human rights 
	and Writer’s independence) by Humayun Azad, <i>Humayun Azad, Ekti Alekhya</i> 
	(Hymayun Azad – a Pen picture) by Latifa Kohinur (wife of Dr. Azad), and <i>
	Amar Smritite Humayun Azad</i> (Humayun Azad- in my memory) by Arefin 
	Siddique. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Latifa Kohinur, 
	wife of Dr. Humayun Azad depicted late Dr. Azad as a great poet, a man of 
	rationalism, freethinker and believer of intellectual freedom. He had many 
	dreams centering his family as well as beloved motherland. But alas his 
	dream remained unfinished as untimely death snatched away his life. Mrs. 
	Azad says, “I saw him fighting through his writings against all forms of 
	superstitions, against religionists and against all sorts of hypocrisy alone 
	and single handed”.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The article of Dr. 
	Azad was reprinted from his newly published book ‘<i>Amar Natun Janma</i>’. 
	He expressed his feeling of what he understood about human rights in 
	relation to writer’s freedom of expression, more specially in the context of 
	Bangladesh at his time. He began his writing with “I don’t know if I am dear 
	to you, but be sure you are very dear to me. May be everyone loves me, or 
	may be not everyone! May be a killer in disguise is waiting here, I don’t 
	know. I did never think that I would be able to stand before you again. It 
	was destined that my life would be terminated on February 27, but here I am. 
	I have not been extinct, because of you, yes because of you. I learnt later 
	that so much love, so much anxiety, so much uneasiness, emotion and 
	obligation for me were waiting from my beloved countrymen, among my students 
	and colleagues of Dhaka University.”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the question 
	of human rights Dr. Azad felt that our concept of human rights still centres 
	on rights of ‘men’ only, women are not included. In his long article he 
	however did not deal with much of writer’s freedom. He spent most of his 
	time in describing the conditions obtaining in Bangladesh. In one place Azad 
	writes, “ In our country too similar condition is prevailing. This 
	state-religion is nothing but fundamentalism. Bangladesh now is a land of 
	fundamentalists; I don’t say it has turned into a fundamentalist state. 
	Afghanistan style fundamentalism has been imported in Bangladesh. …. “</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<h1 align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#000080">First 
	anniversary of Dr. Azad held at Business Studies auditorium, DU:</font></b></h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A seminar and 
	discussion meeting was held remembering different aspects of Dr. Humayun 
	Azad. The meeting, presided over by Poet Shamsur Rahman, was organized by “<i>Humayun 
	Azad Smaran Shava Ayojok Kamiti</i>” and was held at the auditorium of 
	Business Studies Faculty of Dhaka University at 4-30 p.m. It continued till 
	7 p.m. The meeting attended by hundreds of lovers and admirers of Dr. Azad, 
	was addressed by myself (Prof. Ajoy Roy), Dr. Rafiqullah Khan (of Bangla), 
	Prof. Anu Mohammad (Jahangir nagar), Mr. Soumitra Shekhar (Bangla) and Mrs 
	Latifa Kohinur Azad. Janab Mohammad Ali read out a paper on ‘Lekhaker 
	Swadhinata’ based on Dr. Azad’s write as referred above. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In my deliberation 
	I highlighted the writings of Azad dealing with anti fundamentalism and anti 
	communalism. I also tried to bring out his humanistic approach and his 
	respect for human values and humanism. But I stressed that Azad’s real 
	talent was revealed in his research work on linguistics dealing with Bangla 
	language and literature. He has also shown envying talents in the world of 
	Bengali poems. If he had concentrated on these two fields he could have 
	contributed more significantly. But when Azad tends to become reformer like 
	Sarat Chattapadhya, his literary talent was not seen as bright as should 
	have been. This limitation we all have. You cannot excel in every field. The 
	socially conscious and socially bound Dr. Humayun Azad consciously 
	sacrificed his literary talents for fighting against all forms of 
	superstitions, blindness, narrowness, religious fanaticism and communalism. 
	He once said about our Bengali literature that our literature is 
	traditionally full off emotional humanism and human values with little 
	creativity with some exception. The same evaluation might be applied to his 
	many writings. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prof. Anu Muhammad 
	criticized the present government for its failure to bring the killers of 
	Azad to justice. It even failed to conduct an investigation of mysteries 
	that still shrouded his death in Germany on August 12, 2005. Azad’s family 
	has every right to know the circumstance and cause of his death. But alas 
	our government is as callous as ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
