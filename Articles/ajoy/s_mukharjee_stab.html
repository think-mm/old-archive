          <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Here is another horrifying crime
          committed yet on another top minority elite. This time at Jhenaidah.
          Who is the next target? Who are the people doing these crimes. Just
          don’t tell me an unknown group of militants or armed miscreants.
          There is no political motive behind all these systematic killings- I
          wonder. But our home minister and the top police administration are a
          total failure to combat any class of terrorism be it is coming from a
          petty thief (chhich ke chor) or being committed by politically
          motivated armed gangs. Is Bangladesh a heaven of peace and example of
          land of communal harmony as the 4-party alliance government constantly
          claiming ! Here is the story.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<O>

          <h1><font size="4" color="#008000">Popular doctor S.K. Mukherjee
          stabbed to death</font></h1>
          <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span>Date line: Jhenaidah,
          Thursday 18<sup>th</sup> September, 2003: All daily news papers make a
          leading news of killing a veteran doctor Mr. S K Mukherjee, a very
          well known personality of Jhenaidah. Who could imagine that silently
          and secretly he had become a target of militant groups. After Khulna,
          the militants, whose identity has not been yet neither known nor any
          terrorist group claimed the credit of killing of the octogerian
          popular physician and local socio-political leader of the locality,
          once again committed a major crime in broad daylight. </span><span>&nbsp;<O>
          </O>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Doctor Mukherjee was a founder president of
          Khulna branch of BMCA (Bangladeh Medical Association), now a sharply
          divided between pro-government and anti-government groups. He was also
          an influential local leader (erstwhile vice president) of Awami
          League, erstwhile president of Bangabandhu Parisad and erstwhile vice
          president of Hindu Buddha Christian Oikya Parisad. He was the
          president of district Puja Observance Committee. He was a staunch
          believer of liberal democracy and secularism. Although he was leading
          a retired life from active politics keeping himself busy only with his
          medical profession and social works, his enemies perhaps did not
          forget his past. As usual police is yet to find motive of the murder
          and not to speak of finding or arresting his killers. Of course no
          body has any confidence in our police system.&nbsp; &nbsp;<O>
          </O>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span>As has been revealed on Thursday 17<sup>th</sup>
          September he has been busy supervising renovation work of his
          residence. He was upstairs, when the doorbell rang. He came down to
          open the door through his chamber at downstairs. This was around 2
          p.m. As no response was heard for half an hour, the curious maid
          servant (Anna) went for looking her master. To her surprise, the
          chamber was found locked from inside. So she peeped through the window
          to find horrifying scene that ‘daktar babu’ was lying in a pool of
          blood. It was known later that he was stabbed at several parts of his
          body by sharp knives by armed groups of 5-6 men. The neighbors, as
          soon as they heard the screaming sound of Anna, rushed to the place of
          occurrence. Doctor was taken to Jhenaidah General Hospital where he
          was declared dead by the attending doctors. This incident brought an
          atmosphere of shock and horror in the town and condemned by every
          peace loving citizens of the town. According to some neighbors the
          doctor was from some time being harassed and threatened for extortion
          by a group of armed miscreants. &nbsp;<O>
          </O>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span>During the incident AL chief was addressing
          a public meeting at Jhenaidah. On hearing the incidence she rushed to
          the residence of doctor Mukherjee and gave solace to the members of
          bereaved family. She accused that the terrorists and militants under
          the shelter of the 4-party alliance government led by Khaleda Begum
          must bear the responsibility of the crime committed. She demanded
          immediate arrest of the killers and bring them to trial. Is the demand
          of Sheikh Hasina is just a political rhetoric or do have some grain of
          truth. Our most able home minister must provide the answer instead of
          saying “Yakahn yar samoy hobe takhan take chole yete hobe- this is
          the desire of God. Is isn’t it ?” (When time comes he would have
          to leave- this is the decree of almighty Allah).&nbsp; He may further
          add, “<i>Mukherjee babu nirvan lav korechhen</i>.” Who cleared the
          path of <i>Nirvan</i> – this is immaterial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;<O>
          </O>
          </span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Our only anxiety is who is the next target
          after Muhuri, Jnanjyoti, Manikchhari priest, Shrikant Rakshit, and
          host of other victims.... ?</span></p>
