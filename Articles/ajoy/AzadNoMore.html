  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  Citizens of Dhaka took the sad news of sudden death of Dr. Humayun Azad with 
  unexpected surprise and rude shock. The university community and academic 
  circles literarily became what we call thunderstruck. Students community by 
  and large and his colleagues couldn’t believe that he met a natural death. 
  Today, as of yesterday all left leaning students organizations &amp; Chhatra 
  league brought out protest rallies, formed human chains and held protest 
  meetings in which the speakers demanded an international inquiry of his sudden 
  death. His daughters and son suspect that he might have been poisoned some how 
  on the dreadful night of August 10. The Dhaka University Teachers Association 
  (DUTA) brought out a silent procession today (14<sup>th</sup> August) which 
  paraded through the campus ending at the Central Shahid Minar. The leaders of 
  the Association demanded an international inquiry which should reveal the 
  situation which led to the sad demise of the famous writer. Dr. Arefin 
  Siddiqui, President of DUTA, categorically said, ‘It is difficult to believe 
  that his death is natural. When he left for Germany he was in good health, at 
  least he didn’t show any symptoms of ailment that could lead to heart failure 
  or brain stroke. As far as we know he had no serious heart ailment.’ Dr. 
  Siddiqui continued, ‘Anyway we want an international &amp; impartial enquiry which 
  must unveil the circumstances and cause of his death.’</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  In the meanwhile, Mrs. Azad received an e-mail from PEN president based in 
  Munich which stated that ‘PEN’ would make all arrangement of deporting his 
  dead body to the deceased family all the way to Dhaka. He has requested Mrs. 
  Azad to give a signed letter of authorization to PEN in dealing the matter. In 
  an interview with Channel I, Mrs. said that she would hand over the letter to 
  the Dhaka German embassy today. The Pen president is believed to have said 
  that as the result of postmortem so far known there is no sign of his 
  unnatural death. With all probability the cause of his death is brain stroke 
  in sleep. The body of Azad, as the PEN source indicated could not be 
  dispatched before Thursday (19<sup>th</sup> August).</p>
  <h1>Daud Haider From Berlin </h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">** In a dispatch sent from Berlin (published in daily 
  Sangbad, 14. 08. 04) the Bengali Poet, now living in Berlin in exile, informed 
  some tit bits of the circumstances of Humayun’s death. Daud had telephonic 
  conversation with the Mr. Eyohannes Strassar (not sure about the spelling), 
  President of PEN, German Chapter following the death of Dr. Azad, perhaps on 
  13<sup>th</sup> August. He gives a long quotation from the PEN president in 
  his dispatch which reads as follows:</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">“<i>It was prefixed that my son would take Humayun Azad 
  to the police office at 10 a.m. on Thursday to complete some formalities e.g. 
  registration of the address of his residence. After waiting for over an hour 
  during which he pushed the calling bell many a times he returned to inform me 
  that Humayun Ahmed might be out somewhere. My son twice went to meet Humayun 
  at his apartment in the afternoon and again in the evening on the same day 
  without success. He again went to his residence in the morning, yesterday i.e. 
  Friday, but again didn’t get any response on pushing the bail. He then rang 
  me. I immediately went there and called him without any response. This invoked 
  some suspicion. We called the police and broke open the door of his flat only 
  to discover his still body. Police at once requisitioned an ambulance which 
  arrived with two doctors almost immediately. He was rushed to a nearby 
  hospital where the doctors declared him dead. They opined that at least 24 
  hours before the death had occurred. He met his death most probably because of 
  stroke and in sleep; perhaps he died early in the morning. The doctors further 
  opined that death seemed to be quite natural, but his heart seemed to be 
  rather very weak.</i>”</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Those are the words of Mr. Eyohannes Strassar. He is 
  the president of German PEN. He is a famous writer and a leader of SPD. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Last Monday (9<sup>th</sup> August), Mr. Eyohannes 
  Strassar told me from Munich over telephone, “<span style="color:blue">Dr. 
  Azad is still somewhat weak On Friday next (13<sup>th</sup> August) he is to 
  see a doctor for a good health checkup.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:blue">I took him to a dinner on last 
  Sunday (8<sup>th</sup> August) in a restaurant. Dr. Azad commented in course 
  of our conversation,</span> ‘<span style="color:#993300">Ah! I am saved from 
  the clutches of the fundamentalists, at least for one year.</span>’
  <span style="color:blue">Today (9<sup>th</sup> August) evening he would attend 
  a party. The party has been arranged for him. Some professors of Munich 
  university and some writers have also been invited.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Eyohannes Strassar further said, “<i>I am broken at the 
  sad demise of Dr. Azad. Because I invited him to come to Munich, and 
  personally received him at the airport.</i>”</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">On my enquiry ‘where is the dead body of Humayun Azad’ 
  he replied, “<i>in hospital morgue. It would take from 3-5 days to send back 
  his body as we need some papers from Dhaka. German Embassy would send the 
  papers. But Saturday and Sunday are holidays in Dhaka, as well as here. 
  Without police clearance dead body could not be sent.</i>” </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">I 
  told him that his death has invoked some suspicion in Dhaka circles. He said, 
  “<i>I have heard it too. But he died because of stroke, and during sleep. 
  Natural death. Whatever one might think off, the doctor’s report saying that 
  he died of stroke is perhaps correct.</i>”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">[Daud 
  Haider, Sangbad, 14<sup>th</sup> August] **</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  Mr. Daud Haider even today over telephone narrated almost the same story to 
  the Channel I reporter. He informed that his body is lying at the hospital 
  morgue with police formalities completed. The hospital has collected necessary 
  specimen for further investigation. But there is very little hope that some 
  new information would be available from the further two investigations. 
  However the report would not be available before a week. The dead body is now 
  available for dispatch to Dhaka. Haider further informed that only a small 
  Bengali community lives in Germany. There is hardly any possibility that there 
  would be any protest rally as Bengalis living here have accepted the police 
  version of his death. [Daud Haider’s telephonic conversation, Saturday night, 
  14<sup>th</sup> August]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">
  The telephonic conversation of the Channel I reporter with the Bangladesh 
  ambassador reveal no new information. The ambassador said that no one yet is 
  allowed to see dead body of Dr. Azad. He however said that his office is ready 
  to receive the body as when police handed over it to them and the body would 
  be dispatched sooner it gets ok signal from the Bangladesh government foreign 
  office. </p>
