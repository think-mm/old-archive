	Simultaneously all district head quarters excepting Munshiganj, symbolically 
	attacked by Islamic Jehadis, no matter which group or groups they belong to. 
	It is an alarming message to all of us how the Islamic fundamentalists have 
	organized themselves in a well knit network in Bangladesh with direct and 
	indirect government patronage. Still who had some soft corner for BNP and 
	Begum Khaleda this should act as an eye opener. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">63 districts out of 64 of Bangladesh 
	have been threatened by Islamic terrorists throughout the Country from 
	Panchagarh to Bandarbann when almost simultaneously exploded several bombs 
	in important places in each district. The operation triggered simultaneously 
	between 11 to 12 morning, an expression of coordinated effort on the parts 
	of terrorists. The well-coordinated actions clearly indicate that all these 
	incidents were not isolated from each other. It also proves presence of 
	extremists’ and fundamentalists’ organizations of various types, although 
	constantly being denied by our PM, the state minister of interior affairs 
	Janab Babar, our well dressed, apparently soft spoken foreign minister, Mr. 
	Morshed Khan and other top guys in government etc., This also showed how 
	well knit is their network(s). Many a times we reported in MM forum that 
	there are at least 30 plus extremist Islamic groups, many of whom keep close 
	relation with Islamic parties including Jamat I Islami working on the 
	surface. These Islamist armed terrorists have jehadi ideology vowed to 
	establish rule of Islamic laws based on Quean and Sunnah in Bangladesh; many 
	of these jehadis were trained in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir. We, many 
	a times, pointed out that Bangladesh is a soft country where Islamic jehadis 
	find a safe shelter and sanctuary because of sympathetic government 
	attitude. The government of Khaleda-Nizami led by BNP in alliance with 
	Islamic parties of various shades believes in the state philosophy based on 
	Islamic doctrines. It is no wonder that the Talebanis, the Al Quida Jehadis, 
	Banglabhais are at large in BD with government sanctuary and protection.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today, 63 the districts of 
	Bangladesh out of 64 witnessed series of bomb explosions taking place 
	between 11 am to 12 noon. Only exception is the district of Munishiganj. The 
	places, which were target of attacks, are court premises, dc &amp; SP offices, 
	busy market places, even educational institutions. It is estimate that as 
	many as 500 bombs with mediocre strength exploded from remote control or 
	exploded by time setting device. So far 2 persons have been killed with 150 
	injured. Out of two killed persons one died at Chapainabaganj and other at 
	Savar, Dhaka. The pattern of explosion and nature of bombs have striking 
	similarity which points out that actions were carried out by a single 
	terrorist organization or by a united front belonging to well coordinated 
	multi-groups. This is the first time such a wide spread terrorist action was 
	successfully accomplished. The skill and secrecy with which it was completed 
	alarmed the peace loving people, but at the same time it exposed the 
	inefficiency of our defence system and incapacity of various intelligence 
	agencies maintained by our equally inefficient government machinery. The 
	intelligence departments of all kinds, law and order agencies including 
	police and RAB etc. simply got bewildered at not only wide spread explosions 
	but of its near perfect simultaneity. Our great PM, now visiting China 
	again, expressed her concern and as usual appealed to the people to keep 
	calm. She, as expected said that this act of atrocities has been let loose 
	by a group of people who wants to destabilize her well performing good 
	government and do not want tremendous development work her government 
	undertook. She termed them as enemies of the country (thank god, she did not 
	utter ALs from a foreign soil). Her state minister in charge of home 
	affairs, Janab Babar in his ‘characteristic-funny’ English style admitted 
	that his ministry had no a priori knowledge and he is simply taken aback. He 
	said, “We have taken the matter seriously. Yes very seriously.” ‘We are 
	looking for them. Every steps have been taken to protect the life and 
	property of the public’, assured out talkative state minister in charge of 
	home affairs. “The bomb explosions were carried out to create panic among 
	the mass”, informed Babar to the journalists in a hurriedly called press 
	conference in his office. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The result is – the RAB and Police 
	sprang into action, setting up check posts here and there, checking cars and 
	vehicles and searching individuals on streets and roads. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At Dhaka at least at 21 places 
	explosions took place- the places are High court premise, DU campus, Judge 
	court areas where the judges stopped functioning, Motijheel commercial 
	areas, Palashi market etc. Near Palashi market an eyewitness said that he 
	saw a young hujur-like man put a small bag near a ‘grocery shop’ telling the 
	shopper to keep an eye on his bag as he moved away to buy bus ticket. No 
	sooner he left the place a few bombs placed at different places exploded. 
	Many eyewitnesses at different places of explosions narrated similar 
	stories. The pattern is similar everywhere- a moulavi like young man is 
	found carrying a small bag placing it on a suitable place and vanished 
	innocuously after which bomb exploded. Dhaka police arrested at least 10 
	persons out of them 8 were young madrasa students wearing white pajama and 
	Islamic Punjabi with white cap on their heads giving a typical Islamic look.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In Chittagong at least 15 bombs 
	exploded at court premises, government places, market places. At least two 
	people were injured. One man with Islamic handbills was arrested near one of 
	the spot. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact all important cities of 
	Dinajpur, Rajshahi, Natore, Pabna, Sirajganj, Barisal, Pirojpur, Sylhet, 
	Mymensigh, Brahmanbaria, Jessore, Magura… … everywhere pattern of bomb 
	explosion is strikingly similar time wise as well as operation wise. On the 
	average 8 bombs exploded per district. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The 14 party alliance in their 
	reaction said that the work is undoubtedly of well-organized Islamic 
	fundamentalist network, but at the same time they blamed the government of 
	their failure of taking stern actions against these elements. They also 
	pointed out that since the government is in alliance with Islamic forces, it 
	had encouraged the growth of fundamentalism in the country. Leader of the 
	opposition Sheikh Hasina alleged that Government has its hands in these 
	heinous crimes through out Bangladesh. By creating chaos and confusion they 
	want to hang on to power. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In all most all place of occurrence 
	pamphlets written in Bangla and in Arabic on behalf of an Islamic 
	Organization named “Jamaitul Mujahedin” were discovered. They asked 
	government, MPs, Secretaries, Government High Officials, Judges of all seats 
	to work for establishing Islamic rule of law in Bangladesh. If they fail 
	more severe actions will follow, warned the handbills. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It may be recalled that about two 
	years back the same organization was found running an Islamic training 
	centre in Dinajpur town where a few Moulavi like young men were seriously 
	injured while making explosive devices. At that time they successfully fled 
	away with their wounded cadres. Later police discovered from this centre 
	Islamic Jehadi literature, ammunitions and materials of explosions. But 
	Police failed to trace them out. </font></p>
