  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">Fourteenth
  December is known to us as "Shahid Budhijibi Dibas" (Martyr Intellectual Day).
  I am not sure if the word "Martyr" is the exact equivalent to "Shahid". I
  think the word Shahid carries much more deeper feeling and intensive sense
  that touches heart. We shall, who had even remote touch with war of liberation
  for our motherland, Bangladesh or with those days of 69 - 71, the days of
  movement for autonomy, non-cooperation movement of 71 that ultimately led us
  to war with the occupying Pakistani army never forget these martyrs. If we do
  we would betray them and their cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">16<sup>th</sup>
  December is our victory day, the day on which the occupation force led by
  Niazi surrendered to the Joint commander of the Bangladesh-India joint force,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Lt. General Aurora, commander of the Eastern command of Indian force,
  popularly known as "Mitra Bahini". Bangladesh Government and the Liberation
  force was represented by now Air Vice Marshal AK Khondkar, the then and
  freedom fighter Kader Siddiqui, Beeruttam, commander of the liberation force
  of Tangail-Jamalpur zone represented the freedom fighters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">But why
  we should remember 14<sup>th</sup> December? I don't know if our new
  generation in general knows the significance of the day or like the wards "Muktiyudha",
  "Muktiyudher Chetana", "Muktiyodha", "Rajakar", "Al Badar", &quot;Al
  Shams&quot;-- is now a "forgotten day" bearing no meaning to them. Between 12<sup>th</sup>
  -14<sup>th</sup> December of a group of intellectuals belonging to different
  professions were picked up by a locally organized auxiliary force
  collaborating with Pakistani force known as Al Badar and Al Shams. Most of
  them did not return. Later on when ultimately victory came we learnt with
  horrible shock and dismay that these great sons of Bangladesh had to be
  sacrificed at the alter of our dear independence.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">How
  could we remember their sacrifice, their contribution for independence and
  liberation of our motherland ? The then Tazuddin Government declared this day
  as Martyr Intellectual Day so that we can remember them and their contribution
  perpetually. But the day lost its original significance since the turn over of
  history in 1975. Subsequent governments never observe the day in a true
  spirit.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">The list
  of intellectuals killed during the entire nine months of our liberation war is
  quite long and wide spread. You can well imagine how long will be the list of
  general, unknown, unsung heroes who became Shahid. We say we had earned our
  independence at the cost of lives 30 lakh of Shahids and at the sacrifice of
  greatest wealth of thousands of our womenfolk. I take this opportunity to
  remember these unknown heroes and heroines and pay solemnly my respect to
  their feet. I am alive to day because they gave their life and honour to
  protect my life and many likes me. How could I forget them? But how many of us
  tried to repay this debt of ours by trying to discover their identity. Alas,
  only a few. Are we ungrateful, individually or collectively ?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">Today I
  shall remember the by my tributes to my colleagues who became Shahids for our
  independence. Most of them were personally known to, many were intimately. How
  should I begin ? Alphabetically ? May be.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break">

  Simultaneously he was appointed assistant house tutor in Jagannath Hall.
  Socially conscious Anudwaipayan, although not an activist was a silent

  1971. But alas, the dreadful army operation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  the then East Pakistan after obtaining M. A. degree in Bangla from Calcutta
  University. He began his teaching career as a lecturer in Pabna Edward College
  in 1958. He then came to Bangla Deparment of DU as a lecturer in Bangla in
  1966. Subsequently he became Senior lecturer in 1970. A staunch supporter of
  Bengalism with all its associated attributes i.e. a believer of pluralism and
  secularism. He easily earned the animism of the fundamentalists against whom
  we were all then fighting. He was our comrade in arms. It is no wonder that he
  was picked up on the morning of 14<sup>th</sup> December by Al Badrs from his
  university residence.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">He never

  represented. His other noteworthy works are Neer Sandhani, Nirupay Harini,

  of 26<sup>th</sup> March he was shot dead at his residence by a group of army
  jowans of Pakistan when army raided our area in the early morning. From my 3<sup>rd</sup>
  floor flat through a window hole I saw his blood-letting dead body being
  dragged out and lifted on army truck. I shall never forget this scene nor
  shall I ever pardon those Pakistani beasts in human form.</p>

  department in 1955 as a lecturer. He did his Ph. D. on Foreign Policy USA as
  regards to Indian subcontinent from !937 - 1947. An enthusiastic supporter of
  independence movement of Bangladesh. He was an activist inside the university
  organizing movement of autonomy of university and non-cooperation movement. He
  was one of our gallant fighters. For this he had to pay very dearly. When I
  left Dacca in early April, 1971 after surviving the army crack down, I saw him
  in his hiding place and discussed with him my plan of action and requested him
  to accompany me or do the same later on. Alas he could not make it.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">He was
  picked up by the army some time in August together with other few of the
  university teachers. But luckily he was released after a month. He stayed back
  in his university flat from where he was picked up by the Al Badrs on 10<sup>th</sup>

  University. During those dreadful days of occupation period he was a house
  tutor of Mahasin Hall. In middle of August he was taken by the army along with
  his another colleague for interrogation. They were however released within a

  Dr. Guhathakuratha was my teacher in the sense he was my house tutor when I

  an out an out humanist. Whatever humanistic value I acquired, if any I leaned
  from him. He showed me how to love men irrespective of their difference in
  religion, caste and race. He was a follower of great personality Manavendra
  Ray. He was great lover of beauty, environment and whatever we understand by
  the word "fineness". He was a perfectionist.</p>

  dreadful night of 25<sup>th</sup> March army raided his residence near the
  present Shahid Minar. He was shot at the throat. On the following Morning when
  army moved away from the locality he was moved to Dhaka Medical College
  Hospital. I went to see him in DMCH on 28<sup>th</sup>, and saw his pathetic
  condition. Unable to talk I found tears running down from his eyes over the
  cheek. I hold one hand of my dear sir. Nothing we can do or the doctors. The
  hospital was almost cordoned with army persons. I cannot describe the tense
  and fearful atmosphere and environment prevailing in and outside DMCH at that
  time. He breathed his last probably 29<sup>th</sup> or 30<sup>th</sup> March-
  I exactly do not know even today. When I visited hospital probably on 2<sup>nd</sup>
  or 3<sup>rd</sup> April, I found his bed empty. I did not dare to ask any one
  where had he gone. I cried in silence. Where gone his dead body no body knew,
  even after the country was liberated. His beloved wife, our dear Basanti di
  had to move it from one place to another to protect her and her little
  daughter "Dola", a lovable little child. We must remember those brave friends
  of her who took so much pain and care to save her in those critical days.</p>
