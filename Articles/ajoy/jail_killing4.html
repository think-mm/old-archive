    The then jailor of the Dhaka central jail Mr. Aminur Rahman is another very
    important eye witness of the jail killing tragedy, who not only identified
    the ill fated 4 national leaders to the killers bur saw how brutally they
    were gun downed by so-called Capt. Moslem (in fact he was Risaldar
    Moslemuddin Khan –wrongly introduced himself as Capt. Moslem at the jail
    gate) &amp; his killer colleagues. Before the special court located at
    Nazimuddin Road on 10th May 2001 deposition of Janab Aminur Rahman, the then
    jailor of Dhaka Central Jail was heard by the court on 10th May 1971 at 9
    a.m. followed by cross-examination by defence lawyers. The deposition of
    Janab Rahman is reproduced below.</p>

  After Bangabandhu was killed in August 1975, Major Dalim, Major Shariar, and
  Major Faruqh on different occasions telephoned to the central jail to know the
  whereabouts and welfare of the arrested political prisoners on behalf of the
  then president Janab Khandakar Moshtaq Ahmed. On phone they inquired about the
  arrested AL leaders like where they were kept etc. On 3rd November at about
  3-15 a.m. I came to the jail gate after being instructed by the IG prison by
  phone. At the jail gate IG prison told me that he had been informed by
  Bangabhban that some miscreants might come to take away a few prisoners
  forcibly outside the jail. As per instruction of the IG, I ranged alarm bell
  and cautioned the officers and employees under me. On hearing the alarm deputy
  jailor Abdul Jahid, Md. Toeb Ali, Md. Abdur Rauf, Md. Amanullah, Md Iqbal
  Hosain, and three assistant sergeants of the jail arrived there.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">A
  little later a telephone call came for IG prison. After talking over the phone
  he said, ‘one captain Moslem by name and a few soldiers would come at the
  jail gate. You go to the gate and bring them to me.‘ At about 4 a.m. morning
  5 armed persons in uniform arrived at the gate. They were dressed in back and
  khaki uniform but bearing no badge. After making entries of their names at the
  gate register book, they were taken inside the jail. At that time I came to
  know the identity of Capt. Moslem. As per previous instruction of the IG
  prisoner I took them to the office of the DIG prison. At that instance I found
  DIG was talking on a telephone. I came back to my office. A telephone call
  came at that time from Bangabhaban at my office and Major Rashid wanted to
  talk to IG prison. On being informed the IG came to my office and talked to
  some one very respectfully uttering ‘sir, sir. .. ‘</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">In
  the afternoon, fully armed Major Dalim came to the jail gate. He threatened me
  to get him inside the jail. On being informed that for entering inside the
  jail permission of the jail authority is required he got furious saying ‘no
  permission from any corner is needed. Take me inside.’ I knew the power of
  Major Dalim. Seeing his ferocious mood I took him inside the jail. He wanted
  to know where and how AL leaders were housed, and then he also talked to
  erstwhile SP of Dhaka Mahbubuddin, then interned in Dhaka jail. Then he left
  the jail.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Anyway,
  at this time Capt. Moslem said, almost in an ordering tone, ‘let’s go
  inside.’ The IG with Capt. Moslem and all jail officials present then
  entered inside the jail. When inside, Captain Moslem ordered to take them
  where AL leaders were interned. At their order we went near to the new jail.
  Sayed Nazrul Islam and Tazuddin Ahmed were at the very first room of the
  eastern side of cell no. 15. Capt. Mansur Ali and Quamruzzaman were kept
  inside two rooms on the western side of the same cell. As per instruction of
  Capt. Moslem Subedar Abdul Wahed Mridha and I put all 4 leaders inside the
  room 1 of cell no. 15 and remove all other captives elsewhere. I then informed
  the IG that 4 leaders have been put in room no. 1. At that time the jail
  officials and armed persons were together. On hearing this, the men in uniform
  entered the room no. 1 and killed those 4 leaders after opening fire all
  around on their bodies. After completing the operation they left the jail
  almost running.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">After
  some time a jail security guard informed us that another 4-army persons were
  at the gate. When I rushed to the gate the waiting persons asked me to take
  them inside. I did so after entering their names in the register. Then they
  said, ‘Shala (brother in law) take us inside. We have to confirm if the
  leaders really died.’ They threatened me with arms. The soldiers ran towards
  the new jail and bayonet charged the already dead bodies of the leaders after
  entering inside room no. 1. Subedar Abdul Wahed Mridha and myself saw this
  terrible scene as we followed them. Then they left the jail.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">On
  the very day (3. 11. 1) in the morning after the incident I recorded the
  entire incident in `jail book’ in the form of a report. The dead bodies of
  the national leaders were left in scattered condition inside room no.1 of the
  cell no.15 till 11 a.m. of 3rd November. The chief prison guard and other
  prisoners put the dead bodies together with their heads pointing north. I
  collected the watches and rings of Sayed Nazrul Islam and Tazuddin Ahmed
  putting them in a handkerchief-packet, and then returned to my office. On 4th
  November, DIG prison Kazi Abdul Awal made an ejahar (FIR) of the killing
  incident with the Lalbagh Police station. On the same day a surathal-report (a
  report describing physical conditions of killed bodies) of the dead bodies was
  made and postmortem was carried on inside the jail. On 5th November dead
  bodies were handed over to their relatives. “ (Translated from Bangla)</p>

  witness failing to do his duty and take appropriate measure on the fateful day
  was now giving a false witness taught by the government. The lawyers did also
  misbehave with the witness threatening him not to say anything beyond except
  what he was asked to answer. (11. 05. 01)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
