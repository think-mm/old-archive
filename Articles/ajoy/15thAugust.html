  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Today is 15<sup>th</sup>
  August, most gruesome day in the history of brutality and killing our country
  is confronted with. The nation mourns the death of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur
  Rahman, the architect of modern state of Bangladesh, even one might have
  reservation to call him father of the modern Bengali nation. Am I correct when
  I said the 'nation mourns the day', perhaps not. Surely those who are firm
  believers of <u>Bangladeshi nationalism as a political philosophy and doctrine</u>
  that is the jatiyatbadis of all fold including BNP followers and Islamic
  fundamentalists will not mourn or observe the day. Those who think creation of
  Bangladesh is a logical consequence of 1947-partition of India into Pakistan
  with predominantly Muslim majority two zones thousands mile away from each
  other, separated by a alien Hindu dominated country, secular Bharat i.e. who
  still consider that Bangladesh is a mini Pakistan or Muslim Bangla, as
  Zulfiqar Ali preferred to call it immediately after Pakistani soldiers
  surrendered to the chief of the Bangladesh-India joint command, Lt. General
  Jagjit Singh Arora, who happened to be also the chief of the Eastern command
  of Indian Army, popularly came to be referred as Mitra Bahini will not mourn
  the death of Sheikh.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Government is a symbol of
  nation's aspiration. It should uphold some basic concepts above petty party
  politics. BNP-Jamat government under the leadership Khaleda Begum may not
  recognize Sheikh as founding father of 'Bangladeshi nationalism', nor as an
  architect of modern state of 'People's Republic of Bangladesh, but surely they
  should recognize Sheik's contribution of autonomy movement launched by Sheikh
  centering AL's six point charter of demands, his sufferings including Agartala
  conspiracy case at the hands of tyrannical Pakistani military junta and
  autocratic Ayub Khan government, 69-mass movement for democracy and autonomy
  for East Pakistan, historical election triumph of 1970, and finally
  unparalleled non-cooperation movement of '71 and his historic call for total
  independence on 7<sup>th</sup> march.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Even if we admit for the sake
  of debate, that Sheikh very meekly surrendered to Pakistani Bahini on the
  dreadful night of 25<sup>th</sup> March without declaring independence of East
  Pakistan. But shouldn't BNP leadership feel obliged that Sheikh's movement for
  'autonomy and independence' paved the objective condition of 25<sup>th</sup>
  March for cracking down of crazy Pakistani army on innocent sleeping people of
  Dhaka and East Pakistan at large and made the field open for Khaleda Begum's
  husband an unknown major of East Bengal regiment, Ziaur Rahman who was then as
  a loyal Pakistani army officer on his way to Chittagong port to help Pakistani
  military authority unloading arms and ammunitions from the Ship Babar to
  declare independence of Bangladesh on his own (sic). Jamatis claimed that had
  Sheikh Mujib not provoked Pakistani Military Junta and its chief Gen. Yahya
  Khan by his secession movement the tragedy of 25<sup>th</sup> March would not
  have taken place and Pakistan would have saved. For this very act of
  Bnagabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the BNP leaders and its chairperson should
  be grateful to him as this act gave a rare opportunity to Major Zia to 'proclaim'
  independence of Bangladesh on behalf 'our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman'.
  But ungrateful BNP leadership totally forgot any least contribution Sheikh
  made for this wretched nation and its people for its independence and their
  emancipation. Khaleda Begum's government observed birthdays or death
  anniversaries of many cultural and literary persons like Jasimuddin, Farukh
  Ahmed, Golum Mostafa .... and politicians like Sher e Bangla, Moulana Bhasani,
  Shahid Surwardy, Mashiur Rahman (Jadu Mian), Shahid Ziaur Rahman etc..... We
  may ask BNP leaders are the contribution of Sheikh for the down trodden people
  of the then East Pakistan any way less if not greater in comparison of those
  leaders. Is it not fact that you are evaluating Bangabandhu as an opponent of
  your Party and its founder Ziaur Rahman- not in true historical perspective'
  Why do you forget Bangabandhu or AK Fazlul Haque or even Muslim league leader
  Khwaza Sir Nazimuddin can be a competitor of Ziaur Rahman or your present
  party chairperson the great lady Begum Khaleda as all of them died before Zia
  became the president of Bangladesh Pakistan and his party came into existence?
  But BNP leadership is carrying on a relentless shadow war against a dead
  person whom you so meanly call Marhum (late) Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as against
  Swadinatar Ghosok Shahid Ziaur Rahman (like a cracked record). Portraits of
  Sheikh, wherever found are being toppled down, burnt and destroyed with
  vengeance, malice and hatred. Why so meanness is shown to a great national
  leader whom the BNP leaders and their young workers may not respect but surely
  they can show some tolerance. If the government cannot observe his death
  anniversary, surely it can just remember his contribution on this historic
  day. But instead, Jamatis and BNP nationalists are celebrating, though not
  officially, the day as <i>najat divas</i> (day of end of tyrannical regime).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I have a portrait of
  Bangabandhu in my living room with his right hand fore finger pointing up,
  delivering his famous 7<sup>th</sup> March deliberations to millions of people
  assembled in Race Course maidan, now known as Surwardy Udyan. I still feel
  that I am still in front of the great orator listening every word of his
  speech as one amongst millions. It is not a political speech, it emanated from
  his inner core, form his inner feelings for his people whom he loved, endeared
  and respected'the entire mass was simply hypnotized and carried with him. It
  was simply a poem only Sheikh can compose, deliver and overwhelm his
  listeners. I have heard speeches of many great personalities like Nehru,
  Moulana Azad, Subash Bose (in my boyhood), fiery Moulana Bhasani, sentimental
  Sher e Bangla, humorist Shahid Surwardy, scientists like' Meghnad Saha, Satyen
  Bose, Raman, Krishnan .... but Sheikh in Race Course Maidan in front of
  millions, charged with expectations, was superb and unparalleled with his
  poetic speech composed with his own chosen words and sentences charged with
  emotion and reasons. His final call '<i>Ebarer Sangram- amader muktir Sangram,
  Ebarer Sangram Swadhinatar Sangar.</i>' still reverberates in my ear as a tall
  body chocked with tears and emotion standing in front of mine. How could I
  forget the day? From that moment the autonomy movement based on six-points and
  11-points became redundant, as the movement concentrated into one point and
  direction<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><i>Swadhinatar Sangram</i>
  (war for independence), our slogan became '<i>Padma Jamuna Meghna, Tomar Amar
  Thikana</i>' ( Oh river Padma, Jamuna, Meghna! thou are my abodes), <i>Veer
  Bangali Astra dhara, Bangladesh Swadhin kara</i> (Brave Bengalis, Take up
  arms, Make Bangladesh Independent).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">How could I forget his
  memorable speech at Lahore when he declared his '6-point programme' in 1966
  calling this programme as <i>Banchar dabi: 6-dafa Karmasuchi</i> (Demands for
  our survival: 6-points Programme). How could I forget his historic rejection
  of Yahya's fresh invitation to participate in national conference of political
  leaders on 10<sup>th</sup> March, 1971. Sheikh flatly said, '<span style="COLOR: maroon"><i>When
  the Bengalis are embracing martyrdom from army bullets, the invitation is
  nothing but a cruel joke and I have been invited at the point of bayonet. ....
  </i></span>' Before launching his historic non cooperation movement, people
  has not witnessed such movement since the 'quit India movement' of 1942 led by
  Mahatma Gandhi, he called upon his people,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>'....
  from today, courts, government offices, ... educational institutions.... all
  establishments will remain closed sine die.. . The Supreme Court, government
  or semi government secretariats,.... none will operate.... '. From this day
  Tajuddinn Ahmed became if so facto chief executive of 'free Bangladesh'. How
  could I forget this memorable action of Bangabandhu in freeing the Bengali
  nation? One has to witness those events to understand and appreciate. I am one
  of those fortunate individuals who went through these colourful days of our
  making history.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">How could I forget his
  another memorable speech during sixties when he said hinting to continuous
  conspiracy against Bengali speaking people of eastern zone of Pakistan, ' <i>From
  this moment on wards attempts have been made repeatedly to the word Bangla
  from the soil of the country and from the page of map. But let me announce on
  behalf of people of Bangla that from today the eastern zone of Pakistan
  province shall be known as Bangladesh and not East Pakistan.</i>' In earlier
  days when a 1956 constitution was adopted in Pakistan Parliament renaming
  eastern province 'East Bengal' (<i>Purba Bangla</i>) to East Pakistan, Sheikh
  registered his vehement protest saying, '<i>Sir, you will see that they want
  to place the words 'East Pakistan instead of East Bengal'. We have demanded so
  many times that you should name it Bengal (Pakistan). The word 'Bengal' has a
  history, has a tradition of its own.</i>' How I could I forget his utterances?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">How could I forget his final
  speech before his arrest by Pakistani army, declaring independence of East
  Pakistan as 'Independent Bangladesh' immediately after the midnight of 25<sup>th</sup>
  March (26<sup>th</sup> March morning): ' <i>This may be last message, from
  today Bangladesh is independent. I call upon the people of Bangladesh wherever
  you might be and with whatever you have, to resist the army of army of
  occupation to the last. Your fight must go on until the last soldier of the
  Pakistani occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh and final
  victory is achieved.</i>' Mr. Hannan, general secretary of Chittagong Awami
  League read out the message through Kalurghat Radio station on 26<sup>th</sup>
  March morning. Later on the same day Major Ziaur Rahman who had then camped
  near the Kalurghat bridge not far from the radio station at the request of the
  self employed workers of 'Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra' reiterated the
  proclamation of Sheikh Mujib, saying '<i>The Government under Sheikh Mujibur
  Rahman is sovereign legal Government of Bangladesh and is entitled to
  recognition from all democratic nations of the world.</i>' This declaration of
  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman later on was authenticated in 'Proclamation of
  Independence' adopted by elected representatives assembled at Mujib Nagar on
  10<sup>th</sup> April, 1971, a historic and legal document of our war of
  liberation wherein it says,</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">'<i>Whereas
  in the facts and circumstances of such treacherous conduct Bangabandhu Sheikh
  Mujibur Rahman, the undisputed leader of the 75 million people of Bangladesh,
  in due fulfilment of the legitimate right of self determination of the people
  of Bangladesh, duly made a declaration of independence at Dacca on March 26,
  1971, and urged the people of Bangladesh to defend the honour and integrity of
  Bangladesh</i>'.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">....... 'We
  the elected representatives of the people of Bangladesh, as honour bound by
  the mandate given to us by the people of Bangladesh whose will is supreme duly
  constituted ourselves into a Constituent Assembly, and .......<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>in order to ensure for the people of Bangladesh equality, human dignity
  and social justice, <i>declare and constitute Bangladesh to be sovereign
  Peoples' Republic and thereby confirm the declaration of independence made by
  Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, ....</i>'</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">After this historic
  proclamation all controversies of declaration of independence should have been
  brought to an end. But alas the interested circle continued to make fuss with
  the issue. Thanks to late president Ziaur Rahman that during his lifetime he
  never raised this issue of proclamation of independence or tried to belittle
  Bangabandhu or his great contribution. Zia maintained whatever he did, he did
  in the name of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, undoubtedly the undisputed leader of 75
  million Bengali speaking people.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I clearly remember after Zia
  assumed power as (deputy) martial law administer, on the occasion of our
  Independence day in a TV programme he allowed a respectful reference to
  contribution of Sheikh's 6-point movement and wining a significant election
  with overwhelming majority. It was further heard that on that occasion Zia
  wrote his second article on Bangladesh liberation mentioning Bangabandhu as
  architect of new Bangladesh to settle the issue once for all. As is heard off
  it was sent for publication to all dailies, but at the last moment it was
  withheld at the advice of some fundamentalist and ultra-left advisers of his.
  If the story is true, it is a pity for the nation. We would have relieved from
  unnecessary controversies that followed when BNP government came to power in
  1992 and then again in 2001.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Should I remind my dear
  readers, what was President Yahya's reaction as he addressed his Pakistani
  nation on 26<sup>th</sup> March evening after he let loose his soldiers to
  crackdown on 25<sup>th</sup> March night. His rough voice is still ringing in
  my ear, ' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's action of starting his non cooperation
  movement is an act of <i>treason.</i> He and his party have defied the lawful
  authorities.... insulted Pakistani flag. They have tried to run a parallel
  government. The proclamation that he proposed was nothing but a trap. ..... <i>the
  man and his party are enemies of Pakistan, and they want East Pakistan to
  breakaway completely from the Country</i>. He has attacked the solidarity of
  this country'this crime will not go unpunished. ... As for Awami League it is
  completely banned as a political party.'</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Yahya knew who were his
  enemies- no other person except Bangabandhu was singled out as traitor and
  charged with so called act of treason. Even then BNP goes on belittling his
  contribution in the salvation of Bengali people and insulting the national
  leader in the meanest possible manner.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Yahya could not execute the
  punishment he pronounced on Bangabandhu because of international pressure, but
  his faithful servants in Pakistan army of Bengali origin, some in 'disguise of
  freedom fighters' carried out the will of general Yahya on 15<sup>th</sup>
  August, 1975. Bravo! Bangladesh army officially has never under took the
  responsibility of removing of Government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman nor his
  brutal killing by a section of army jowans and officers. But neither it had
  conducted any inquiry to reveal the real truth nor punished any breakaway army
  personals involved in the tragedy who killed not only a president of the
  country but the architect of Bangladesh and all ideals-- our war of liberation
  stood for. The killing of Bangabandhu revealed the weakness of top army
  leadership and army bureaucracy as well as infrastructure of the army.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">While we are mourning, India
  is celebrating its 57<sup>th</sup> day of Independence. On this day 56 years
  back, the British union jack was slowly brought down signifying the end of
  British rule in India and in its place tri colour Indian National flag with
  Ashok-Chakra in the middle, symbol of peace, was unfurled. From the Lal Killa,
  Indian PM Atal Behari Vajpayee in his address to the nation appealed to the
  Indians as well as Pakistanis that for the sake of peace, progress and
  tranquility in the region India and Pakistan should forget about fighting
  against each other, rather both countries wage war against the poverty. PM

  Bangladesh, 58<sup>th</sup> birth day of Bangladesh Prime Minister Mrs.
  Khaleda Begum is being celebrated by her admirers, her ministerial and
  political colleagues, high officials with pomp and grandeur. Her family
  members signaled the day of observance when at 12-15 a.m. on Friday she was
  wished long and prosperous life by cutting a cake, lighting candles and
  chanting 'happy birth day to youuuuuu ......<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>.'
  At 8 p.m. demy official function took place at 30, Hare Road, the Jamuna Guest
  House, official evening secretariat of PM. Top political leaders and senior
  ministers, students leaders and host of her admirers assembled at Jamuna Guest
  house and wished the PM happy birth day. The heaviest cake that was presented
  to her weighs 132 lb. Apart from hundreds of small and mid-sized cakes as many
  as five 58 kg cakes were also cut on the occasion. PM as reported thanked all</span>
  <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: windowtext">of them and sought their
  cooperation in running the country.</span></p>

    is no harm in celebrating birthday of Khaleda Begum by her admirers and BNP.
    But what embarrasses us as to her choice of 15<sup>th</sup> August to
    celebrate her birthday. This she did only when Awami League came to power
    and officially started observing 15<sup>th</sup> August as national mourning
    day. On earlier days Begum Zia's birthday was observed on a different day.
    Obviously to observe 15<sup>th</sup> August as her birthday all on a sudden
    bewildered many and surely there was obvious mean motive behind it. People
    say that she has three or four date(s) of birth. When she became PM of
    Bangladesh her bio-data as supplied to the Government record books had a
    different date, it is alleged. It is rumored, her school certificate shows
    yet another date, and in her last passport she gave another date of birth.
    As far as I remember a case was filed against her by a civilian for giving
    misinformation if her date of birth is really 15<sup>th</sup> August.
    Learned and aged journalist ABM Musa, as far as I remember wrote a very
    interesting and humorist article in Janakantha (?) on the matter saying
    everyone has the right to choose his or her birthday as he or she really
    does not when he or she came to earth. Only parents can throw some light,
    but alas Khaleda Begum is an orphan in that sense!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
    </span>But let us hope this time she sticks to the latest one.</span>
