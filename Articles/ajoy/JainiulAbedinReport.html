  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Chairman
  of the one man commission, Justice Jainul Abedin yesterday (01. 10. 04)
  submitted his report of 21<sup>st</sup> August grenade attack on AL sponsored
  mass assembly at Bangabandhu Avenue to the Secretary, ministry of home affairs
  (not even to the state minister). The incident in presence of hundreds of
  police and ever alert RAB forces &amp; officers and intelligent agencies took
  at least 25 lives including that of Ms Ivy Rahman, a top AL leader and injured
  several hundreds some them were very seriously still carrying hundreds of
  splinters inside their bodies.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The
  very nature of the formation of the committee indicated that it was just
  eyewash having no seriousness on the part of the government. AL seeing the
  motif of Khlaeda_Nizami Government very rightly rejected the commission and
  decided not to co-operate with its proceedings. In spite of the attitude of AL
  and other opposition parties, the one man commission, which may be termed as
  in Bengali proverb ‘Dhal nai toloar nai, Nidhiram Sardar (Nidhiram Sardar,
  the captain without sword and shield went ahead with its fact finding and
  probing mission. Justice Abedin claimed boastfully that although AL did not
  cooperate with his mission he acted as a neutral person, not toeing with line
  of the desire of the government. Abedin admitted that his terms of reference
  were limited and he does not have the authority (any courage? Mr. Justice).
  Government had made no hide &amp; seek of its intention. Begum Khaleda and her
  General secretary once a left politician, a follower of fiery Moulana Bhasani
  public stated that the in the incident there were likelihood of a third force
  (meaning a force from outside) with the intention of destabilizing the
  country. Commission report as said by the chairman himself in a press
  conference held yesterday contained such findings. It so said that aim of the
  act was to create confusion and instability of the country. By creating
  confusion and instability by a third force who would be the beneficiaries. I
  am sure justice has neither the courage nor the means to pinpoint the third
  force and likely beneficiaries.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The
  salient points of the commission report that came out from the tit bit
  comments of the chairman may be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">The Killers were in the
      meeting in the disguise of AL workers and aim was to create situation of
      instability.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">The failure of the police has
      no limit. Instead of trying to run after and identify the fleeing killers,
      the police opened fire and teargas on the AL supporters. This act of
      police helped the killers to safe escape.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Inefficient TV reporting on
      the part of electronic media</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">There were no coordination
      among the different intelligent agencies</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">I
  better not waste my time quoting the recommendations, which never be followed
  either by the government or the police and intelligent departments. Some
  recommendations are childish (e.g. A close relation to cultivate among the
  important parties).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The
  learned justice also wished like an innocent baby that for the sake of
  national interest the political parties should work together and develop
  closer ties among themselves. This kind of cooperation must be coming from the
  civil society too. The non-cooperation to the commission on the part of the AL
  has been termed as ‘unfortunate’. The commission is unable to public its
  report on its own because of its limited power, which our public understands.
  Mr. Justice you followed the letter of the act, not its spirit. For whom a
  commission is constituted? Obviously for public as it is the ultimate source
  of power. This is the problem with justices; they fail to see a bit beyond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">It
  is sure that like other reports of various commissions this would also not see
  ‘light’.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Mr.
  Justice Abedin should have not taken this job on three counts : firstly, he
  has some pro government image (right or wrong is a different matter), secondly
  AL for whatever reason when questioned his efficiency and credibility, and
  rejected its formation that on the plea that its report would not be
  ‘neutral’, as a judge he should have felt embarrassed and rejected the
  offer, thirdly, as he knew very that his commission has neither proper man
  power nor logistics to investigate such a serious matter. As for example when
  he alleged that a third force might be involved with local agencies, can he
  substantiate this serous matter with proofs? When he mentioned some names of
  leaders and workers of a political party, who acted as stooges of a foreign
  power, can he substantiate his allegations?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Who is that foreign power? Could a responsible government publish such
  a name of a foreign force? Most unlikely. The government will give effect of
  those wordings of the commission, which could be applied against AL on its
  toe. Thank Mr Justice for your neutral role and the report, which has been
  prepared from a hypothesis, as pointed out by our great self-made Marxist
  diplomat and journalist Mr. Eanyetullah Khan, New Age editor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
