  &nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Dear Muktomonas, &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span lang="EN-US">The alliance government and its 4 
	components led by BNP started celebrating of their assumption of state power 
	completing three years, quite successfully as claimed by the alliance 
	leaders and their party workers. It may be recalled that 4-party alliance 
	took over state power on October 10, 2004 following a massive election 
	victory, which was rejected by the AL because of heavy vote rigging. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">To mark 
	the 3<sup>rd</sup> anniversary of BNP and its other components of assuming 
	office of the government a mass meeting was arranged to day at the Muktangan 
	premise in the afternoon. Thousands of their supporters and workers attended 
	the meeting, presided over by city mayor Sadek Hosain Khoka MP, in which top 
	BNP leaders including LGDR minister and BNP’s general secretary Janab Mannan 
	Bhuiyan (as chief guest), Health minister Dr. Kh. Musharraf Hosain, Mirza 
	Golum Abbas, Law minister Barrister Moudud Ahmed, Mr. Tariqul Alam (Forest 
	and Environment minister), Amanullah Aman etc.&nbsp; And some leaders of Islamic 
	parties including that of Jamat I Islami. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The 
	speakers highlighted the success of their rule over three years. If you 
	listen to their boundless claim your feelings would be Bangladesh is 
	floating on the sea of peace, tranquility, happiness, a condition prevailing 
	in which inhabitants can sleep in their homes with the doors open which 
	reminds us the reigns of Great Asoka, Harun ar Rashid, Great Akbar …. . They 
	claimed that ever-alert vigilance of police, the operation clean heart led 
	by the army, operation ‘cobra’, the action of RAB and CHITA had brought a 
	great relief to the common people like us. So let us express our joy with 
	delightful cry “ <i>Ore Tora Jayadhwani kar, tora jayadhwani kar</i>”, of 
	course in the name of our great lady <i>Deshanetri</i> Prime Minister 
	Khaleda Begum. May we very meekly ask madam PM, if according to utterances 
	of your GS and other central leaders of your party and those of alliance 
	there is no trace of terrorism then why journalist Deepankar Chakraborty of 
	Bogra was brutally killed on the eve of 3<sup>rd</sup> anniversary of your 
	good governance and why your own party leader Mr. Sheikh Liton, a local BNP 
	leader of Bagerhat and Union Parisad chairman was killed at the hands of RAB 
	on 3<sup>rd</sup> October 2004 (just two incidents mentioned as examples).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">But the 
	main theme of the contents of speeches delivered in the meeting by the 
	leaders was to criticize the opposition parties. The main target was Awami 
	League and its leader Sheikh Hasina. In a top of his voice and making stern 
	movements of both of his hands and fingers Mannan Bhuiyan, the chief guest 
	of the assembly criticized AL and its leadership very sharply that may be 
	summarized as follows:&nbsp;</span></p>
	<ul style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm" type="disc">
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">For 
		the development of the country ‘We need earnest cooperation of the 
		opposition party (AL), with out its meaningful cooperation development 
		work is hampered’. </span></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
		But, the minister complained, the AL did not cooperate with the 
		government for the last three years.</span></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">
		Instead, the AL called hartal &amp; strike one after the other to jeopardize 
		the development work of BD. </span></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The 
		minister further complained that they (the opposition) created in the 
		past, creating now and are determined to create chaos and confusion with 
		a view to capture state power in an unconventional method.</span></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The 
		AL wants enjoy the fruits of democracy, but it does not believe in 
		democratic procedure and methodology.</span></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The 
		AL wants to make the parliament ineffective, and for this reason they do 
		not attend parliament session. Even when AL attends occasionally, its 
		MPs create law and order situation inside the parliament to make it 
		ineffective. </span></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><span lang="EN-US">The 
		chief guest however assured his audience that BNP will not tolerate it, 
		and would not allow AL to be successful. Mr. Mannan warned AL that in 
		spite of its non-cooperation, the alliance parliamentarians would make 
		the parliament quite effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;We just 
	want to remind the minister of LGRD affairs, how many days you attended the 
	parliament to make it effective. How much meaningful cooperation you 
	extended when AL government was implementing various fruitful projects of 
	developments and trying to address political problems and issues they 
	inherited from your government – the bad economy, the worst law &amp; order 
	situation, and issues like ‘Chittagong Hill tracts’, Ganges Water sharing 
	pacts. How many days in a year BNP observed hartals and strikes resulting 
	how much economic loss the country incurred. At that time your deshonetri 
	threatened, if needed be hartal would be imposed everyday to unseat 
	government of Sheikh Hasina. Now you Mr. Mannan talk of democratic 
	methodology.&nbsp; You were once a Marxist, a follower left brand of politics of 
	NAP, led by Moulana Bhasani, who believed in the principle of ‘Voter age 
	bhaat chai’, who says parliament is an abode of pigs, now teaching us 
	principle of democracy. BNP does not believe in collegiate principle of 
	democracy. Your party principle is based on abeyance orders without question 
	coming from top. BNP is a party based on autocracy and dictatorial 
	principle. Democracy has no place in BNP’s constitution. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;Where 
	have you seen Mr. Mannan that in parliamentary practice, opposition 
	cooperates with party in power in implementing the projects of the party in 
	power? The function of the opposition is to point out the faults and wrong 
	policies followed by the government. The opposition may take part in a 
	dialogue when called by the Government on national issues. But the 
	government has to be sincere, cooperative and accommodative. On every count 
	the BNP led government failed. So cooperation from opposition why should 
	come? In fact BNP does not want it, because cooperation has never been found 
	place BNP political culture.</span></p>
