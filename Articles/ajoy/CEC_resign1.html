	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The Election commission is 
	in a mess. And the main hero for bringing the commission to its brink is 
	none but the chief election commissioner (CEC), the faceless justice M A 
	Aziz himself with the aid of his two distinguished colleagues, the two newly 
	appointed members of the commission, namely justice Mahfuzur Rahman and Mr. 
	SM Zakaria, formerly secretary of the commission. Since the day justice Aziz, 
	a sitting judge of Supreme Court of appellate division stepped in into the 
	shoes of erstwhile CEC controversial Mr. Sadeq, our learned justice has been 
	trying his utmost best to make the commission an obliging front organization 
	of BNP and its copartners in the alliance government. As soon as the post of 
	CEC fell vacant following the end of tenure of Mr. Sadeq, the main 
	opposition party AL and 11 parties including Dr. Kamal Hosein’s Gana Forum 
	demanded that this important office of the election commission (EC) be 
	filled up by a widely respectable man whose neutrality and integrity are 
	beyond doubt. The opposition and a large section of the civil society of the 
	country opined that although it was the prerogative and privilege on the 
	part of the government, the government should not do it unilaterally. They 
	suggested that the person to occupy the seat of CEC should be chosen after 
	due consultation with various shades of opinion on a general consensus 
	basis. The government did open up dialogues with concerned parties, but all 
	on a sudden it took a unilateral decision ignoring all other suggestions, 
	and appointed Justice Aziz as CEC. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">It is alleged that his 
	appointment is a consequence of his past association in different capacities 
	with BNP. People cites some incidents of his association with BNP and the 
	elements like that. As for example, while he was a sitting judge he publicly 
	welcomed one of the influential cabinet ministers of BNP government and his 
	wife in a public function in the locality of the justice. The incident 
	invited criticism from many corners and helped diminishing his image as a 
	justice of neutrality. He also gave births of some controversial judgment 
	that created public criticisms and debates: He gave verdict in favour of 
	closing down the popular TV broadcast known as ‘ETV’, allegedly to please 
	Begum Khaleda; he declared the public safety act illegal framed during AL 
	tenure; he called 3 distinguished editors and journalists to the court 
	allegedly behaving with them in discourteous manner because those 
	journalists published some ‘wrong information’ (in his eye) about the court. 
	Further to it, before he got appointment as the CEC he obtained a plot of 
	land in Uttara from Khaleda government. The deal’s unwritten message was, ‘<span style="color: blue">We 
	helped you in your need, help us in our need</span>’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="CEC_pic/Fig[1]._2_Cartoon_Prathom_Alo.jpg" width="302" height="409"></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center"><b>Pic : A cartoon in 
	Prothom-Alo, a leading Bangla Daily</b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The appointment of justice 
	Aziz as the CEC faced stiff opposition from the opposition, and they opined 
	that his appointment (being known as pro-BNP man) would cause diminishing 
	neutrality and independency of the election commission under his guidance, 
	which would in turn hamper the process of holding free and fair election in 
	the coming year. The later events proved the opposition points. However, 
	after the appointment, he although announced in a press conference that he 
	is committed to hold a free and fair election and commission would act as an 
	independent organ, started doing many things that caused alarm in the 
	opposition circles. He failed to win over the confidence of the opposition 
	parties, especially the AL. As he joined the EC, he immediately came into 
	clash with his two independent minded colleagues, EC AK Muhammad Ali and EC&nbsp; 
	Munsef Ali who were staunch defendant of independence of election commission 
	and other independent minded officials. He showed his favour to EC secretary 
	Mr. SM Zakaria, who became his man of confidence on whom the CEC became 
	dependent as his chief adviser. In order to how to ‘hold free and fair 
	election’ he invited the political parties for discussions. But apart from 
	Ershad’s JP and BNP and its party alliances, the main opposition AL and 
	other 11 parties including CPB, NAP and JSD did not respond to his 
	invitation. Instead of trying to generate confidence of the political 
	parties outside the ruling alliance, he continued his mission of holding 
	discussions with large number of unknown so called ‘political parties’ (not 
	less one hundred !). Was the CEC kidding with the nation ? He even declared 
	once that he would, if needed be, go ahead with formulation of mechanism of 
	holding election even if AL or other opposition parties do not participate 
	in it. He never tried to make EC a truly independent body and failed to 
	design (he in fact did not intend to do) a system that would prevent 
	governmental influence, intervention and interference. On the contrary 
	although his actions as CEC brought controversy and inviting bad name for 
	the EC he continued his policy to keep the government in good humour, 
	especially to please the PM Begum Khaleda. Justice Aziz is a peculiar man, a 
	thoroughly confused one as his behavior pattern steadily unfolded to the 
	public. He has allergic reaction to meeting the press and journalists. Many 
	a times he held press conference but refused to answer the questions thrown 
	to him. He even pretended occasionally to be sick to avoid the press. On one 
	occasion he fell ill to avoid a European Ambassadors intending to meet him 
	and took shelter in BIRDEM. The practice of his getting sick on many 
	critical moments evoked public humour and criticisms too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Ignoring the demand of the 
	opposition, he according to the advice of the BNP, BNP led alliance, the 
	government and innumerable number of so called political parties, he 
	announced that a new voters’ list would be made under the supervision of EC, 
	without taking into account of the existing list, prepared in 2000, and the 
	databank already stored it the data base of EC’s computer system. His two 
	colleagues, Mr. Munsef Ali and Mr. Mohammad Ali opposed his idea of making 
	‘a new list’ suggesting that the existing voter list should form the basis 
	which could be updated by bringing in new entrants and dropping the 
	ineligible voters from the list and making use of the existing data base in 
	the computer system. The two members even questioned if the database were 
	not to be used why then this had been created with huge amount of public 
	exchequer. They also warned him that if CEC went ahead with such move they 
	would not be with him. But he acted more on the advice of the then secretary 
	of the commission Mr. SM Zakaria, a known pro-BNP bureaucrat called as ‘rod 
	of BNP’ (BNP’s Lathi), who was later rewarded by the government as he made a 
	full member of the commission, and took all steps to prepare a new voter 
	list.&nbsp; </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Disgruntled AL immediately 
	filed two separate writ petitions- (1) one through Mr. Abdul Jalil, MP, GS 
	of AL and (2) the second through jointly Advocate Rahmat Ali &amp; Mr. 
	Asaduzzaman Nur, MP, challenging the unilateral action of the CEC ‘to go 
	ahead with making the new voter list’, at the high court division on 
	December 12, 2005. The learned HC bench constituted of justice MA Matin and 
	Justice Rezaul Karim issued a show cause notice to the CEC - why EC’s action 
	of preparing new voter list would not be declared illegal. Defying this high 
	court order, the CEC officially launched the programme of preparing a fresh 
	list of voters from January 1, 2006. The learned HC division in its 
	unanimous verdict on January 4, 2006 asked CEC not to pursue the plan of 
	making a new voter list, instead the verdict asked them to update the 
	existing list prepared in 2000. In addition to it the learned HC bench 
	issued 5 instructions to EC how to update the existing list: </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">In the meanwhile two new 
	additional members, namely justice Mahfuzur Rahman and Mr. SM Zakaria joined 
	the Commission, who strengthened the hand of the CEC. While Mr. Zakaria is 
	know as BNP’s lathi, the Justice Mahfuzur Rahman was found to give sanctuary 
	to a known BNP cadre with weapons during the ‘clean heart operation’. The AL 
	and other oppositions treated this move on the part of the government as an 
	evil plan to making EC a puppet body loyal to government and the 4-parties 
	allied forming the government of Begum Khaleda or most obedient servicing 
	tool of BNP led government. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">Fig. 1 CEC Aziz and his two colleagues, three 
	doctors of Voter list manipulation (Please insert Fig 1 of the attached 
	files) </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in">Being 
	strengthened by his new colleagues, CEC instead of complying and executing 
	the HC instructions decided to challenge the verdict of the HC in the 
	appellate division of the Supreme Court and simultaneously decided to carry 
	vigorously to complete his mission of making the new list before the supreme 
	court business is over. The ulterior motive behind the move was to make the 
	new voter list a fate accompli. Other two members (Mr. Munsef Ali and Mr. 
	Mohammad Ali), however, in the meeting of the commission differed with the 
	CEC and other two newly appointed members siding with the CEC urging upon 
	the CEC to give effect to the verdict of the HC instead of going to the SC 
	for appeal against the HC decision. The CEC on February 1, 2006 formally 
	filed a leave to appeal with the supreme court the HC verdict, especially 
	objecting on two points of the 5-fold instructions that the EC should 
	prepare the list on the major basis of the existing electoral roll of the 
	year 2000 AD, and that the EC should publish some salient points of the 
	verdict in a report form in the media. Hearing of the appeal petition was 
	however delayed because of illness of a justice and other matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">In the meanwhile another 
	matter developed. In a local TV channel in a discussion meeting between an 
	AL leader Dr. Alauddin Ahmed and a BNP leader Nurul Islam Manir, MP some 
	comments made about CEC invited the attention of the commission. The CEC 
	through his lawyer filed another appeal on February 5, 2006 praying that his 
	original appeal petition should be heard in a full bench with the presence 
	all the justice. On 27<sup>th</sup> March in the hearing of the later appeal 
	in presence of all the judges the bench wanted to know whether this appeal 
	were an expression of no confidence in the division, and it decided to issue 
	an order why a notice of contempt of the court would not be served against 
	the CEC and Mr. Nurul Islam Munir. On the day of hearing (April 17, 2006) of 
	the both the appeals filed by the CEC, the SC relived of both the CEC and 
	Mr. Munir from allegation of contempt of the court, and granted the leave to 
	appeal with date of hearing fixed on May 14, 2006. The SC appellate division 
	however did not issue any stay order on HC verdict of January 4, 2006. Any 
	sensible person would have postponed the process of making the fresh voter 
	list waiting for the verdict of the SC. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">But our redoubtable iron 
	minded CEC is not made of ordinary flexible texture; he rather vigorously 
	followed to complete the list with electronic speed by employing a large 
	number of ‘information collecting volunteers’ and officials. As I said 
	earlier the ill motive of the CEC behind the move was to complete ‘the job’ 
	so that matter would look ‘fate accompli’, a clever and ill intention to 
	influence the proceedings of the SC indirectly. The CEC even had the 
	audacity to comment on the HC verdict and on its observations saying that he 
	had never seen such observations from the higher court in his long ten years 
	of his tenure as a justice. His colleague justice Mahfuzur Rahman went a 
	step further when he passed a comment on the HC decision, ‘EC does not have 
	to obey the High court directives’. How ill thinking judges they are, I 
	myself cannot make of them. Are they foolish, or <i>Jnan-Papi</i> (one who 
	commits sins willfully or consciously)? </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Undaunted CEC published the 
	so-called ‘new list of voters’ (draft list) on May 3, 2006 giving three

	<h1>The doctored Voter List</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText">Very soon it was discovered that the list is full of 
	mistakes, omission of lakhs of names of genuine voters, and most importantly 
	it was deliberately filled with fake voter names exceeding the number to 
	millions. How could it happen, one really gets perplexed. It was apparent 
	that the list is a doctored one prepared with an obvious ill motive of 
	keeping the parties now in government once again in the seat of state power. 
	Should we call it a doctored voter list or should we nickname it as ‘Azizian 
	Voter List’. On top of it, the voter lists were not available with ward 
	commissioners’ offices. Even it were available in some offices, the ward 
	commission officers were not keen to show the lists. In some offices list 
	names were displayed on the walls of the street adjacent to ward commission 
	offices. On the next day it was found torn apart. Let us give some examples 
	as illustrations how the list was manipulated to put some one in power. The 
	some one is the BNP and its allies including the Jamat. An analysis of the 
	published list reveals that this is an excellent piece of manipulation done
