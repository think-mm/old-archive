  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="line-height: 150%">&nbsp;<br>
  The city witnessed a city of protests and violent rallies of general public. 
  Following the gayebi-jamaja (prayer meeting for the departed souls in absence 
  of their dead bodies) a mourning procession was brought. AL leaders including 
  its Secretary general Abdul Jalil, Workers Party President Rashed Khan Menon, 
  Ganoforum leader Dr. K, led the processionamal Hosain, Dilip Barua, Hasanul 
  Haq Inu etc. The procession soon joined by large numbers of common people 
  turned into a protest procession. It moved through zero-point at Matijheel 
  parading through Bangabandhu Avenue ultimately ended at the central Shahid 
  Minar. The mass demonstration continued in the city till 8 p.m. In many areas 
  the enraged mass destroyed many motor vehicles. The police at many points 
  tried to disperse the mass and in doing so resorted to lathi charge and firing 
  of rubber bullets and tear gas shells. These resulted injuries to common 
  people. The entire Motijheel, Purana Paltan and Bangabandhu Avenue areas 
  turned into a battlefield between the mass &amp; the law-enforcing agency. Police 
  and BDR have been employed in all-important points of the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;<b>Police 
  filed two cases</b></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;The 
  Motijheel police filed two cases on their own (1) case of setting fire and 
  assault against police, and (2) Bomb assault in public place. The Motijhee PS 
  police authority did not entertain the case prepared by AL secretary general 
  Abdul Jalil and Sheikh Hasina’s political secretary Saber Hosain Choudhury. It 
  however recorded the case as FIR. The case filed has two points, (1) Bomb 
  assault to AL meeting with an aim to kill its leader Sheikh Hasina, (2) 
  Conspiracy against democracy. Commenting on the refusal by the police to take 
  the case, AL secretary general said, ‘We do not expect anything better from 
  the Government &amp; its police administration.’</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: red">I.V. 
  Rahman’s condition</span> </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;Ms. I. V. 
  Rahman’s condition continued to be critical. She has been transferred to CMH 
  fro DMCH yesterday night. She has already been given 22 bags of bloods. It is 
  learnt that both legs of her have been imputed. PM today went to CMH to see I. 
  V. Rahman and Major general (retd.) Tareq Ahmed Siddiqui, an AL leader. He 
  gave a brief description of the yesterday’s incident on being requested by the 
  PM. The PM requested the attending doctors to provide best treatment to Mrs. 
  Rahman and others receiving treatment at CMH. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">&nbsp;It is now 
  learnt positively that AL leader Sheikh Hasina received a terrible shock 
  during series of bomb and grenade blasts in her very presence. It appeared 
  certain now that she was the prime target of the violent assault. As a result 
  of this assault she received minor injury at her left leg, but she had 
  suffered an internal hemorrhage inside her ears. This has caused heard of 
  hearing. Attending doctors advised her to take a week’s rest and to keep 
  herself away from noisy and loud sound source. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height: 150%" align="justify">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: red">American 
  Ambassador &amp; India High Commissioner met Sheikh Hasina&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;US 
  ambassador Harry K. Thomas today saw AL chief at her Sudhabhaban residence, 
  Dhanmondi and expressed his sympathy to her. He stayed with her for an hour. 
  Speaking to attending pressmen at Sudhabhaban, the ambassador that he was 
  terribly shocked at the event. He was shocked to learn so many people died and 
  injured. He condemned the incident telling that in a peaceful protest rally 
  such violent bomb blast is simply barbaric and against the spirit of 
  democracy. In a democratic system everyone has the right to protest, he 
  opined. Indian High Commissioner Ms. Bina Sikri also went to express her 
  sympathy to AL chief at her residence. She thanked God that AL chief escaped 
  the assault unhurt. She condemned the incident as cowardice and against the 
  democratic norm.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;Sheikh 
  Hasina, AL chief &amp; leader of the opposition today accused the government of 
  its involvement in the bomb last incident in a AL mass rally at Bangabandhu 
  Avenue. She appealed to the countrymen to come forward to throw out this 
  government from the state power. She appealed for an international inquiry of 
  the incident. He held the government and the communal force responsible for 
  series of bomb blasts, violent killings and terrorism through out the 
  country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;She 
  pointed out that following the incident the Begum Zia has no right to stay in 
  power- she should resign immediately. But would she ? Has she that morale ?&nbsp;
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%"><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="color: red"><b>An 
  Inquiry committee firmed&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;The PM, 
  after holding a cabinet meeting, announced today formation of a one-man 
  inquiry commission headed by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice 
  Joynul Abedin. The committee was given three week’s time to submit its report.
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;The state 
  minister of interior affairs told the press today that he has received more 
  than once directives from PM to look after the law and order situation of the 
  country. The state minister has informed that a red alert has been announced 
  throughout the country. The law and order and peace keeping forces have been 
  advised to take appropriate measure to preserve law &amp; order situation. The 
  minister, a mouthpiece of his master Begum Shaheba vowed that at all costs the 
  culprits would be brought to justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;<b>B</b>ut 
  we have heard many a times such empty vows, Mr. State minister, not only from 
  your predecessor, air vice marshal Mr. Altaf Choudhury, who once said ‘the 
  hand of law is too long for any culprit to get away’, but from your Master PM 
  Khaleda Begum of empty and sugar coated assurances. But how many culprits have 
  been arrested, not to speak of brought to justice, may I ask Mr. Babar ? And 
  about Madam PM, the less we say better. Yes, I mean it.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;Today two 
  grenades have been discovered, one inside the Dhaka Central jail (!), and 
  another was found lying Golap Shah Mazar, near chawk bazaar.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">&nbsp;<b>Entire 
  Country Protests</b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: red">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <h2 style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Through out the country protests against bomb 
  blasts were held &amp; in many cities total hartal was observed. On many 
  occasions, the police clashed with the protesters. At Bhairabbazar railway

  bound train was attacked by a violent crowd. 12 bogies were set fire and 
  completely destroyed, though however no causality was reported.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%"><i><b>The 
  incident raises some salient points :&nbsp;</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
    <p style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify">The question of our so 
    called security system which terribly failed to give minimum security not to 
    common mass, even to the important personalities including the AL chief and 
    leader of the opposition. Was the security system at all serious even in 
    view of the series of violent actions being conducted against important AL 
    leaders including Mr. Suranjit Sengupta, recent bomb blast at Sylhet town in 
    which an AL leader was killed, a popular AL leader of Gazipur killed 
    recently. Or were they deployed there to clash and lathi charge the AL 
    leaders and supporters and beat the attending mass as they were instructed 
    to carry on in the past. </li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
    <p style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify">Do our intelligence system 
    at all exist ? How come our so well trained intelligence departments 
    including one of Army intelligence totally failed to detect such a violent 
    bomb cum grenade blast publicly in a mass rally of the opposition party ? Or 
    should we assume that allowed the things to happen. Our army, police and 
    other law enforcing agencies cannot escape the responsibility. They must 
    answer to the public why they failed to protect such a large number of 
    innocent public being killed and severely injured. It is no use then keeping 
    such institutions with public money. </li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
    <p style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify">Why government failed to 
    provide full proof security arrangement of a prescheduled important meeting 
    of Awami League. Specially in the backdrop of recent violent activities 
    (including bomb blasts) of some terrorist groups throughout the country, why 
    our law and order enforcing agencies did not advice the government taking 
    appropriate preventive measure in the meeting of AL. Or should we believe 
    that our security authorities remained callous because of the government’s 
    attitude. And government’s attitude is perhaps as their record shows ‘let AL 
    suffer &amp; disappear’.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
    <p style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify">How come grenades usually 
    used by army could be obtained by terrorists or the transplanted agencies of 
    the interested circles and successfully carried on their mission ! </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%">The 
  appropriate authorities including the cabinet headed by Begum Khaleda must 
  answer these and some similar questions. She cannot escape her responsibility. 
  She knew the attitude of the communal &amp; Islamic fundamentalist forces now 
  surround and support her to wards the AL and its chief Sheikh Hasina. These 
  mullah’s jehadi supporters can do anything, - is our democratically elected PM 
  Begum Shaheba unaware of their terrorist activities &amp; motives. If she pleaded 
  innocence, I am not prepared to accept it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
