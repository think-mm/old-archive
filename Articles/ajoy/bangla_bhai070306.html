	Muslim Janata Bangladesh, Bangla Bhai alias Siddiqur Rahaman at last 
	surrendered to the police severely injured:</b></p>
	<div class="doc-layout-body">
		<div class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
			<font face="Verdana">After obtaining information on latest hideouts 
			of most wanted militant Islamic leader named Siddiqur Rahman, 
			popularly known as Bangla Bhai from arrested JMB Chief, Shayekh 
			Abdur Rahamn a strong intelligent team accompanied by strong RAB 
			contingent and armed Police rushed to Mymensigh and raided a house 
			in the city, R K Mission Road, this morning (March 6, 2006) at about 
			5-30 a.m. They found Fahima, wife of Bangla Bhahi living there with 
			her minor child Saad. Police arrested them and a few inmates too. 
			After obtaining information from the wife the team rushed to 
			Muktagachha, a small township about 30 km from Mymensigh. The team 
			took the wife as their guide who showed the house, a small tin shade 
			semi pucca house consisting of 2 or 3 rooms, in a nearby village 
			named Rampur, where Bangla Bhai was hiding (?), rather living openly 
			with a group of his associates. The armed contingent immediately 
			encircled the house and went into operation. Exchange of fire took 
			place for a few minutes when a bullet from inside the house wounded 
			a police officer. It was found later that Bangla Bhai himself fired 
			the officer when he peeped into the house from the roof of another 
			nearby house using a submachine gun carbine. At this stage the 
			commanding officer of the operation team asked Bangla Bhai to 
			surrender, as there was no escape route for his safe retreat. The 
			exchange of bullets continued for some time. After some time a 
			violent explosion (s) took place and the tin shed house was blown 
			out and fire was set out. After some time when the smoke was clear a 
			big fatty bearded man was found with submachine gun holding in his 
			right wounded hand receiving severe injuries from his own bomb 
			explosions. And another man later identified as his bodyguard Masud 
			was laid on the floor unconscious in a seriously injured and burnt 
			condition. The bearded big and fatty man was immediately identified 
			as Bangla Bhai, alias Siddiqul Islam, alias Siddiqur Rahman. It was 
			later found in the hospitals that Banglabhai received injuries all 
			over the body- he had burn injuries on his right hand, all over the 
			chest, upper abdomen, left part of the body and testicles. Later 
			x-ray photograph taken at BDR hospital showed that he had some 
			splinters inside the stomach. Both injured men were arrested at 
			about 7-45 a.m. and both were brought to Muktagachha health complex 
			at least for preliminary treatment. As the condition was getting 
			worst both wounded persons were taken to Mymensigh Medical College 
			Hospital. Bangla Bahi was then airlifted and taken to combined 
			Military Hospital. After being treated there he was finally moved to 
			BDR hospital at Pilkhana in the afternoon around 5-30 p.m. It is 
			learnt that ‘he is now out of danger and stable’, to quote from 
			state minister of interior affairs, Mr. Babar.&nbsp; </font></div>

			<font face="Verdana">I will not call it a drama, but will call the

			Bangla Bhai is preplanned and a result of understanding between the 
			leaders of JMB and JMJB and the government because these militant 
			leaders and their organizations were made, nourished and developed 
			by a well known Islamic partner of the 4-party alliance well 
			supported by the present government of Bangladesh led by Begum

			to guard Bangla Bhai, Abdur Rahman and militant activities of their 
			organizations ? Why our funny state minister of home affairs used to

		<div class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
			<font face="Verdana">There must have gone something behind the 
			scene, which led to some understanding between the militants, and 
			the government that ultimately resulted the drama of arrest of two 
			top Islamic militant leaders. The arrests of these Islamic 
			fundamentalist who believes in armed Islamic revolution to establish 
			Allah’s laws in BD and other Islamic terrorists operating in BD are 
			not myths and creation of media as has been constantly claimed by 
			the government and ruling parties, they are real threat to our 
			Motherland. Since the fall of Talebans in Afghanistan the 
			secularists of the country have been warning of the violent rise of 
			Islamic terrorism if proper steps were not taken. 
			Liberal-secular-democratic forces of the country forewarned that 
			many militant fundamentalist organizations are operating in BD, and 
			pointed out the outdated Madrasahs are being used as training 
			centres of these militants. But Government and its 4-party alliance 
			laughed at our fear. Government cannot escape from its 
			responsibility for creation of Banagla Bhais and Shayekh Abdur 
			Rahmans ….&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></div>

			<font face="Verdana">The revolutionary leaders do not live openly as 
			did Bangla Bhai and his spiritual leader Shayekh Abdur Rahman. The 
			million dollar question is why they did ? Why Bangla Bhai did not 
			attempt to flee away after the arrest of his wife at Mymensigh city 
			? Where was their so-called efficient network through which they 
			conducted their armed activities since September? So there must be 
			something mysterious which need to be solved. Khaleda – Nizami 
			Government and the parties of the Islamic alliance must prove beyond 
			doubt that did not have any hand in the rise of Islamic 
			fundamentalism that encouraged Islamic militantancy in Bangladesh.&nbsp;
