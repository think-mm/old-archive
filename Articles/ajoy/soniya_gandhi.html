  In a dramatic development in Delhi, Mrs. Sonia Gandhi declined to accept the
  office of the Prime Minister. Until yesterday, it was sure that Sonia Gandhi
  would the country of over one hundred crores people as its Prime Minister. She
  was invited yesterday (17th May) by the President Abdul Kalam to see him in
  connection of forming central government under her leadership. But Sonia
  refrained from seeing the President hurriedly and planned to see him today
  (18th May). Since then i.e. yesterday night rumors started spreading that
  Sonia might change her mind, possibly in view of the BJP’s latest stand (i)
  refusing to accept her as PM because she was born in Italy, a foreigner in the
  eye of BJP leaders, (ii) declaring the day of oath of as black day in the
  history of India, if Sonia takes the oath as PM, (iii) making a decision in
  BJP and NDA parliamentary meeting to boycott the oath taking ceremony, (iv)
  taking a vow by the BJP workers and RSS fanatics to take the issue to the
  streets, thereby creating a law &amp; order and confusing situation, (v)
  issuing threats of making nuisance and confusion in the country by two top BNP
  leaders Shusama Swaraj, a member of the Rajya Shabha and Uma Bharati, chief
  minister of Madhya Pradesh, if Sonia becomes PM.<br>
  <br>
  <span><b><span style="background-color: #99FF99">Sonia saw President Kamal</span></b></span><br>
  <br>
  Today Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, leader of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)
  accompanied by top leaders of UPA including Dr. Manmohan Singh and Mr. Pranab
  Mukherjee. The meeting took place at 12 noon and lasted for an hour. After the
  meeting she told the awaiting journalists that she would see the president
  again tomorrow (19th May). This created some confusion and rumor started
  spreading very fast that Soniajee, as she is beloved called by her followers,
  has declined to accept the premiership. Later on it was known that Sonia did
  not submit any list of MPs belonging congress and UPA or the probable list of
  ministers to the President. Instead, she talked to him in general terms
  regarding formation of stable new government of UPA, an alliance led by
  congress commanding a majority in the Parliament.<br>
  <br>
  <span><b><span style="background-color: #99FF99">A Great decision of a great
  lady</span></b></span><br>
  <br>
  As thousands of congress supporters started assembling in front of the
  congress central office in New Delhi, it is almost certain that she has
  declined to accept the nomination of PM. Throughout the country, including
  West Bengal are found demanding for reverse of her decision. In order to clear
  the confusion and communicate her farm decision to her colleagues she at 7
  p.m. addressed the congress parliamentarians that she has made a farm decision
  not to accept Premiership of India. Elaborating factors influencing her such
  heart braking decision she said that a great confusion is being created
  nationwide on a trivial issue of her foreign origin. In an emotionally choked
  voice she said that again and again the personal issue of her foreign birth is
  being brought in the national level. She further added that she had never
  aspired for that post, what she worked for was a return of democracy based on
  secularism. She said that her prime concern is to provide a strong and stable
  government in India. She said that since she stepped in politics she has been
  working for making Indian democracy and secularism strong. She then added,
  “I pledged myself to work with the country.’ Before announcing her
  decision she said, “The position I am in today is because a inner voice
  always pushed me to do so. This inner voice today tells me not accept the
  office of the PM for the greater interest of the country.’<br>
  <br>
  According to my assessment the factors that influences her decision are:<br>
  <br>
  (i) she became tired of this issue of foreign origin being brought out again
  even after decisive election victory, a personal embarrassment for her and the
  family.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><br>
  (ii) the opposition, more particularly BJP leadership threatened boycotting
  the oath ceremony and calling it black day in the history of India.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><br>
  (iii) BJP workers supported by RSS promised to take the issue to streets and
  organizing a nation wide movement. She did not want this as this critical
  juncture of starting the process of setting secular democracy to jeopardize on
  a personal issue.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><br>
  (iv).A case has been filed in a lower court seeking Sonia’s eligibility of
  becoming PM.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><br>
  (iv) India faces bigger problem today than her being a citizen of foreign
  origin.<br>
  <br>
  Whether her decision would go down as historic one and would bring good to the
  Indian people remains to be seen. Jyoti Bose, the CPIM leader was of the
  opinion that her children Rahul and Priyanka, in view of RSS’s threat, not
  to expose their mother to any more danger, must have influenced the decision.<br>
  <br>
  <span><b><span style="background-color: #99FF99">Uma Bharati tendered
  resignation</span></b></span><br>
  <br>
  In the meanwhile two ladies are trying to snatch away the limelight focusing
  on Sonia’s face to their ‘bright faces’ made of 100% Indian skin. They
  are trying to stage a drama of their own. One is Shushama Swaraj who has
  threatened to resign from the Rajya Shabha with her husband. She further said
  that she would shaven her head if Sonia becomes PM. Thanks to Sonia that
  Indian people would have not to see the ugly head of such a beautiful lady.
  The other lady is Uma Bharati, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, who saw the
  President yesterday to put forward her case against Sonia’s becoming PM.
  Perhaps, the President turned a deaf year. Undaunted, the great lady send her
  letter of resignation to the BJP president Mr. Naidu. Another farcical drama
  as she knew at heart that this so called resignation letter would receive no
  attention.<br>
  <br>
  Good news is that whether Sonia or no Sonia components of UPA are holding
  together. The decision of Sonia has thrown ice-cold water to the face of BJP
  led NDA. Now it is almost 2 a.m. morning of 19th May, and thousands of
  congress supporters still are shouting and pressing for reverse of Sonia’s
  decision. She solaced her supporters that ‘she would sleep on their
  request’ . I think she has taken the correct decision for good of India’s
  secular democracy by taking away the initiative from the fundamentalists of
  BJP led NDA, still a strong anti secular force to be reckoned with. It is not
  easy to give up the temptation of Premiership of world’s largest democracy.
  She was, and still is at the doorstep of Indian Premiership. It is a hard, but
  a very thoughtful decision she has made. Let us see.<br>
