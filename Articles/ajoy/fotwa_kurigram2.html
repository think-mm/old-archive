	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The word Fatowa has its origin in 
	Arabic word, fatra. According to Bengali Dictionary compiled by Sansad it 
	means `Islami Sastraanusare rai’; nirdesh ba adesh’.| In English equivalent 
	we may say, fatowa means ‘a mandate, a decree, especially conforming to 
	Islamic laws. In Pakistan, although an Islamic Republic, basis of the 
	judiciary system is secular inherited from British secular system of 
	judiciary. However there is`Sharia Council’ formed by autocratic military 
	president Ziaul Huq. The `Sharia Council’ is charged with the responsibility 
	of monitoring if social and state affairs are being conducted according to 
	Islamic laws. If there is a violation council can intervene pointing out to 
	the authority concerned. Even in Pakistan the institution fotowa is not 
	state recognized institution. In Bangladesh context, fotowa has become a 
	nuisance, and being used as an instrument against women. Even if we agree 
	that fotowa is a good institution if applied in correct and proper way, who 
	are the people to give or issue such decrees. The village touts, political 
	mastans, illiterate moulanas and imams of local mosques ? The supporters of 
	fotowa argues that through this institution many social and religious 
	problems could be sorted out, judicial trials of minor nature connected with 
	lands etc. be held at the local level. But what is the legal basis of such 
	actions of fotowabazis. We may recall that a few years back, the Mahila 
	Parisad filed a writ in High Court against issuing decrees and mandates and 
	prescribing and executing punishments in the name of fotowa. The High Court 
	division passed issuing of fotowa as illegal and orders issued by fotowa are 
	not valid in the eye of the state laws. To any conscious citizens it is 
	obvious that, if such institution is allowed to run in the society its ill 
	effects are bound to create manifold problems instead of solving them.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fotowabazis have special target on 
	women and their activities. Let us see where the fotowabazis operate: </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. If our women folk works in NGO or 
	any other offices; if they ride on cycles or motorbikes 2. Whether our women 
	folk wear `borkha’ covering their entire body except two slits through which 
	they can see; many borkhas have eye-slits covered with fine net. 3. If a 
	women is found moving around openly with her beloved or husband. 4. If a 
	woman is raped by a gangster(s); if a woman is accused of having illicit 
	sexual relation with a man other than her husband (gena). 5. Whether a talak 
	has been uttered properly or not 6. Whether after the period of iddat has 
	been observed 7. In the case of a divorcee husband willing to remarry her 
	divorced wife, whether a marriage has been performed with another man and if 
	that man has divorced the woman concerned. What an irrational and clumsy 
	remedy. The girl concerned is not only being humiliated, but a forcible 
	sexual relation has to be committed against her will. If this is not a rape 
	then what is the definition of rape. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In every aspect of women they are 
	treated as objects not as human beings having conscience or will. Whatever 
	their men folk or the society wants to impose they can without any 
	hindrance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Village women are the worst 
	sufferers. The fatowabazis willfully forget that traditionally our women 
	folk work in agriculture fields covering their body in a decent way with 
	sari. But in name of so-called islamization of the society, the Mullhas and 
	Moulavis fall on our women folk to harass them openly, punishing unjustly 
	making them despicable in the eye of the society. But alas these fotowabazs 
	constitute the elite of our rural society exercising their dominance over 
	the common helpless poor. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Story of a minor girl </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Reader, if you are not a follower of 
	Islam, then you would probably not know what is called ‘dorrah’. It is a 
	punishment according to Islamic Shariat to be executed on the person of the 
	accused by whipping with a rope, cane or special kind of leather whip. A 
	young man of the same village raped a poor girl living in a quiet village 
	Bhangura under Khan Marich Union in the district of Pabna some time in the 
	first week of October 2005. When the matter was reported to the father of 
	the culprit a and the victim family demanded actions against the culprit 
	from the village matabbars (village leaders), a village salishi (council 
	meeting) was summoned whose members were- Matabbar Moqsed Ali, Raisuddin, 
	Dalu Mian, Hosen Ali and Nijamuddin, at 8 p.m. evening on Saturday, October 
	15, 2005. The council in its verdict found the girl guilty of inducing the 
	young man to commit the sexual intercourse. The Imam of the mosque Golam 
	Rabbani was asked to prescribe the form of punishment. The obliging Imam 
	pronounced that girl must be whipped 101 (101 dorrah) times on her delicate 
	body and the culprit boy was to be fined of Tk. 800 only, not because he 
	committed raping but had premarital intercourse. When the punishment was 
	being executed no body came forward to save the girl from the inhuman 
	beastly torture. The girl became unconscious, but the execution of whipping 
	continued till counts 101 was completed. What a shame! Do we live in a 
	civilized society? Even then we will call Islam a religion of peace, a 
	religion of tolerance, a religion of equality among men and women, among 
	rich and poor. If you are a Muslim, please think hundred times, if you are a 
	human rightists, please come forward to do some thing to save our women folk 
	from the tentacles of fatowa-octopus. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the girl’s family refused to 
	obey the verdict, they were threatened to be driven out of the village. In 
	the very presence of many silent villagers and the family of the victim girl 
	the punishment was executed with the perverted delight of the council 
	members of the fotowa. Next day when the father of the girl wanted to inform 
	the police, the village matabbar went to his house threatening that if they 
	did excess the family would be driven out of the village. Police later 
	visited the place but could not trace the victim family. Obviously they were 
	hiding out of shame and disgrace. When contacted the chairman of the Khan 
	March union, Janab Alim said, “I heard the of the incident, but don’t know 
	the details.” The mattabar Mr. Moqsed Ali, the most enthusiastic member of 
	the fatowa, who also presided over the fatowa meeting said, ‘the salish has 
	found the girl guilty. For the good of the society this kind of trial was 
	held.’ The imam said, ‘I prescribed the form of punishment as directed and 
	desired by the matabbar’. So this is how an Islamic institution called 
	fatowa is being used by village touts and so-called village leaders (matabbars) 
	and imams of mosques. Even then our society keeps itself mum, and in the 
	meanwhile our mothers, our sisters become the victim.&nbsp; </font></p>
