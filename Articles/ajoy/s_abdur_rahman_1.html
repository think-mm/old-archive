	hideout in Sylhet City yesterday, left, the front view of Surya Dighal Bari, 
	the single-storey hideout of JMB chief Abdur Rahman in East Shaplabagh in

	Abdur Rahman</i></font></p>
	<p class="MsoTitle">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since Morning (1. 
	03. 06), or may be the last night, an armed mission composed of RAB, local 
	police force aided by civil administration of Sylhet district is being led 
	to arrest the much wanted JMB spiritual leader Sayekh Abdur Rahman, who is 
	believed to have taken shelter in well fortified house in Sylhet room with 
	his wife and children. The police got the information when they arrested one 
	of the top disciple of Rahaman and leader of JMB, third in ranking. On the 
	basis of the information, a combined operation was directed to arrest the 
	wanted leader of JMB whose head-value has been declared by the government as 
	five hundred thousand.&nbsp; The entire complex has been encircled with thousands 
	of Police and RAB armed with all modern arms and equipment. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	police are asking Maulana Rahman to give up as all routes to escape from the 
	house have been sealed off. To test the reaction and existence of living 
	beings RAB used mild tear gas and robber bullets. The force does not want to 
	go into commando operation, which might cause larger causalities, and Rahman 
	might be killed or he himself might kill himself. Psychological pressure is 
	being applied against the leader and his militant companions. The operating 
	Bahini is planning to get into the house by breaking the walls of some rooms 
	or roof. As a result of persuasion, although Rahman did not nor any of his 
	accomplices respond, however his wife Nurjahan Rupa with her younger son, 
	her daughter Alifa with 4-month child Talha anf sons Mahmud and Fuad, and 
	wife of an JMB activist at about 12:30 p.m. yesterday came out of the house 
	and surrendered to the police.&nbsp; After some time at the instance of Police 
	his wife also appealed to Abdur Rahman to give up himself to the police, but 
	with no avail. Mrs. Rahman said later that she did not know who else are 
	living inside the house being a <i>pardanashin</i> woman.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Police 
	believed that the leader and his companions might have confined themselves 
	in a small room or a bathroom – all of them putting suicidal bombs on their 
	bodies. No sooner the police enters the house they will switch on the 
	explosive devices to explode causing huge explosion demolishing the entire 
	house complex and near by houses. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Shayekh 
	Abdur Rahamn has informed the police that as he does not believe in human 
	made laws he is not going to surrender to the police as they are the product 
	man made state machineries. He can only surrender to Allah and none else.&nbsp; 
	At one time he however wanted to talk to state minister Babar, in charge of 
	home affairs and asked the police to arrange such meetings. He warned 
	further that it would be not an easy task to arrest him. He has large 
	explosives dumped inside the house, which he would use to explode the house 
	and it’s surrounding. Obviously Police is not taking his warnings lightly. 
	The spiritual leader also appealed to the RAB and other enforces to withdraw 
	from the scene and go back as he believes many of the RAB and other members 
	are soldiers of Islam. And they must act to follow the path of Islam. Since 
	Morning of yesterday he has however stopped giving sermons to the law 
	enforcing units.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Apparently police is bewildered what to do. How long the police would 
	continue fortification is any body’s guess. But it seems that during the 
	night they are not going to lunch a major assault against the JMB leader.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	house in question is a one storied building owned by one Mainul Haque, who 
	usually lives in London. The house has a beautiful name “Surya Dighal Bari.” 
	Which was rented to one Hridoy Chowdhury on the recommendation of a local 
	commissioner, said Mr. Mainul Haque, who arrested by the police yesterday. 
	Since when Abdur Rahamn and his JMB companions took shelter in the house it 
	is not clear. Some 1000 strong men composed of Police, RAB and BDR sprang on 
	to action based on the information obtained from an arrested JMB leader at 
	Baitul Mukarram that Abdur Rahman is hiding in the locality Shaplabagh in 
	Sylhet town. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	operation force split into three groups before coming to the house in 
	question started their mission at 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday (28<sup>th</sup> 
	February 2006) by searching as many as 40 houses in the area spread over 
	Tolagarh, Shaplabagh, Bramhanpara, Mirapara, … . Finally a RAB team arrived 
	at the Surya Dighal Bari, located at Shaplabagh Road #2 at 9 p.m. and 
	knocked at its entrance without any response from inside. The team went back 
	to search other houses before it came again at 12-30 morning (Wednesday). 
	The team entered the compound and knocked again. A man (30) with a sword in 
	his hand appeared inside a grilled verandah and shouted “Naraye Takbir” and 
	then vanished inside. The team confirmed that JMB leader must have been 
	hiding here. The entire house was then cordoned heavily with forces. </font>
