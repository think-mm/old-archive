  <p class="MsoBodyText">The infighting between Sunni terrorists Vs Shia ultras
  in Pakistan shows no sign of ending. Though the ratio of Sunni-Shia attacks on
  each other is not one to one, Shias are not as weak as Christians and
  Quadiyanis in Pakistan or as weak as Hindus-Christians-Ahmediyas in
  Bangladesh. Shias are quite determined to fight back in Pakistan, though they
  may not be numerically as strong as Sunnis. Shias constitute about 20 % of the
  population of Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Ban
  imposed on religious processions on the streets and any assembly in mosques
  other than namaz by the central and local governments has not improved the
  tense situation of terror stricken Pakistan. And there is no sign of easing
  the tense situation. Communalism, Fundamentalism, Terrorism, Fanaticism, and
  Obscurantism – thy name is Pakistan. Thank God, we East Bengalis severed
  from that ugly Pakistan, though we had to pay a heavy price, and still paying.<o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">No
  doubt, apparently General Pervez Musharraf in his own style is trying to
  constrain to limit the Islamic extremism of Sunnism. But no visible effect is
  felt yet. The Pakistani society is basically an obscurantist &amp; religiously
  fanatic society. Liberal modernism has not penetrated into the society.
  Anglo-Mohammedanism Movement of early nineteenth century of Sir Sayed Ahmed is
  a total failure- it did not succeed to usher a new liberal minded Muslim
  middleclass bent in freethinking &amp; open intellectualism. Aligarh College,
  later a University failed to generate a spirit of modernism with broad outlook
  among the Muslim community, with few exceptions. Instead it produced a
  sectarian Muslim elite, which gave intellectual support to Jinna’s
  non-practical Pakistan movement.<o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">BBC’s
  Zaffar Abbas (11-10-04) reported that ‘some had hoped that Pakistan’s
  crackdown on Islamic extremists would herald a period of religious harmony.’
  But government’s peace-keeping agencies’ hope had dashed away by the
  recent happening of consecutive bomb blasts in Shia mosques and assembly of
  Sunni sympathizers of an unlawful Islamic Terrorist organization.<o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Once
  again on 10<sup>th</sup> October a Shia mosque at historic city of Lahore was
  the target of attack of terrorism. A bomb was blasted at the entrance of the
  Husaina Hall mosque when a suicidal bomber detonated a device as people had
  gathered for evening prayer. The report says that a man with a brief case
  tried to force his way into the mosque. When the security guards stopped him,
  he opened fire and blew himself up. The incident killed two security guards
  and four others including a boy of 13 years old—six in total. This month
  alone no less than 70 musullis on both sides of Shias and Sunnis were killed
  in a series of terrorist attacks on the mosques. BBC informs that ‘a mood of
  anger inside the Shia mosque, (exists), with Shia Muslims who worship there,
  refusing to let police enter the premise.‘<o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The
  people of Lahore is rather astonished as Lahore, relatively a peaceful city,
  has been free of sectarian and communal frenzies so far. Lahorites felt that
  this is a result of upsurge of old cycle of violence perpetuated by extremists
  from Sunnis and Shias, two main sects of Islam. No Islamic extremist group or
  individual has claimed for carrying on the attack so far.<o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The
  government of Punjub as well as central government had put Police and the army
  on high alert nationwide particularly for Friday congregations. For the last
  few months here are some major sectarian violence:<o:p>

  The deep root of Shia-Sunni schism lies in History of Islam and its tradition.
  Zaffar Abbas of BBC has mentioned a few of them in his recent report:<o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Difference between the
      majority Sunni and minority Shia Muslims dates back to the earliest days
      of Islam.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">They are directly linked to
      the issues of succession following the death of Prophet Muhammad.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">The Shia believes that after
      Prophet Muhammad’s death, his-son-in-law, Ali, should have been given
      the reigns of administration. They still regard him as the first imam or
      spiritual leader.</li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">The Sunnis, however, believe
      that the appointment of one of the Prophet’s companions, Abu Bakr, as
      the first Caliph was correct. The Sunnis also respect Ali as the fourth
      Caliph of Islam.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Whatever
  might be the reason of Shia-Sunni conflict in Pakistan lying in history of
  Islam, the fact is that Pakistan as a modern state is a failure. It has failed
  to build itself as a state of equal rights for all its citizens irrespective
  of their sectarian beliefs and religious faiths. Instead it has declared
  itself an ‘Islamic Republic’ thus banning rights to non-Muslim communities
  in Pakistan. Sunnis thought that by the term ‘Islamic’ it meant the Sunni
  variant of Islam, as Pakistan constitution bars to frame any laws which go
  against the basic principles of Islam and Sunnism. Other Muslims belonging to
  other <i>tariqas</i> have no place in the republic with rights equal to
  Sunnis. So history of Pakistan is the history terrorism, communal and
  sectarian riots, killings, and autocracy under the patronage of militarism.
  Pakistan military is one of the most fanatic institutions in the world whose
  tradition our BD army unfortunately inherited, although it claimed that the BD
  army grew out of our great war of liberation. But it is an irony of fate, it
  did not inherit the spirit of liberation war- the liberalism, tolerance to
  all, and secularism, in stead our army draws inspiration from Islamic spirit
  whatever that means.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The
  result of schisms between various group of Islamic doctrines, the inter
  religion hatred and riots had taken many innocent lives in Pakistan since its
  birth. Only because of Shia-Sunni hatred and conflict since 1980, more than
  4,000 people have lost their lives. What answers the followers of Islam would
  give on the day of judgment (the day of <i>Kiyamot</i>) ?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
