  <p align="justify"><i>Continuation from <a href="../../new_site/mukto-mona/Articles/ajoy/scientific_mind.html"><b>
  <font color="#333399">Part- 1</font></b></a></i></p>
  <p align="justify">Now we know, apart from a few contemporary naturalists 
  including Wales, a good many natural scientists before Darwin. The great epic 
  poet Gayety after critical and comparative studies and examination of skulls 
  of human beings and other animals proposed some kind of theory of evolution. 
  Long before Darwin, Geologist Bafoon in his 'Natural History' opined that 
  present continents, great mountains, and valleys .... would be destroyed in 
  time and a new cycle of creation would usher in. Another Geologist in his book 
  'Theory of Earth' and Gugmiller in his 'Testimony of Rocks' supported the 
  views of Bafoon very strongly. But to the religionists, views of science are 
  not important, the views of the holy scripts carry greater weight. For this 
  very reason, the faculty of Theology of Paris proscribed those opinions of 
  Bafoon as those contradicted views of the Church and Bible. Bafoon in order to 
  save his life instead of arguing with the Church admitted the supremacy of the 
  Bible. Descendents of such 'fatwoabazis' i.e. opponents of 'Science and 
  Reason' are innumerable even today in our society and their existence are 
  strongly felt. </p>
  <p align="justify">The modern Palaeontologists and Palaeo-bioscientists now 
  hold the view that the first life evolved in earth more than three thousand 
  millions years back i.e. after about one thousand million years of creation of 
  the planet earth. The First life was just a single cell - these bacteria-like 
  beings are called '<i>Prokaryots</i>'. From this mono-cell life gradually 
  evolved into multi-cell beings. Through long process of evolution all form of 
  modern lives and animals evolved; the human beings are no exception. Life 
  scientists have recognized twelve elements that played significant roles in 
  the creation of life of which four were most important- '<i>Nucleotide</i>',
  <i>Nucleic acid, specific temperature and suitable ambient pressure.</i> One 
  fine opportune moment having appropriate temperature and pressure those 
  elements combined to form first life, a special state of matter. A great leap 
  forward- a transition from a state, 'lifeless inorganic matter' to another 
  state, matter with conscience. That what we call life today. But the Life 
  scientists did not stop here mere knowing how life had evolved, nor their 
  scientific query and research about life stopped. Through the relentless 
  research on life science and Genetic-sciences they now know mystery of life; 
  man has now the key of controlling and modifying his own life. Man has now 
  acquired immense power of revealing the mystery of the genetic programme 
  inside the body and modifying this programme- the programme that in fact 
  controls creation of life. We get overwhelmed with strangeness and joy and 
  when we are told that all forms of life depends strangely only on limited 
  number of 'clues' of </font><font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><i>chemical 
  elements</i></font><font face="Verdana"> and a </font>
  <font face="Verdana" color="#000080">programme</font><font face="Verdana">. 
  These four elements have a common name nucleotide with its components: 
  adenine, thiamin, cytosine, and guanine (ATCG). These four symbols are called 
  'letters of life'. What a strange that permutation-combinations of these basic 
  four letters make the difference between a rose, a bush or a wheat-plant from 
  a microbe, an elephant or a human being. We may mention here that a typical 
  genetic programme in a human body is made of 3000 units made of 4 elements (ATCG) 
  and are residing in million of millions of cells in a spiral configuration 
  forming a giant molecule. </font></p>
  <font face="Verdana">
  <p align="justify">Life scientists have estimated that if molecular biology 
  have the capability then it could print out this programme in thousand 
  volumes, each volume containing one thousand pages. Of these volumes of books 
  each letter is its gene that, depending on whose clues the fundamental 
  elements of a body are arranged. With the help of sensitive chemical equipment 
  these '<i>instructions</i>' arranged along the long helical spiral could be 
  identified. These could be recognized as milestones and within them position 
  of gene of decease could be located. In this way the medical scientists can 
  detect whether a man is carrying a defective gene, whether a child is born 
  with disability- so that necessary curative measure could be taken. The same 
  technique could be adopted in more complicated decease like heart trouble, 
  high blood pressure, diabetics, even cancer. So the future science of medicine 
  is more of preventive nature rather than curative. They would be able to 
  foretell about decease on a stronger footing that will make easy for the 
  doctors to remove the cause of decease rather than cure it. It is not unlikely 
  that an old man would be able to lengthen his life-span with full vigour and 
  vitality. </p>
  <p align="justify">However we have to be conscious of one thing- the ethical 
  side of this science in its application. We are also afraid of this immense 
  potentiality and power at the hand of genetic doctors and engineers. We of 
  course praise our genetic scientists for producing high yield rice or wheat. 
  But we are afraid that the same genetic technology may be applied on human 
  beings. The physicists in the decade of fifty's faced the same ethical crisis 
  as the genetic scientists are facing today - where to draw the 'line of 
  boundary' of further carrying on research. Would they carry on research 
  without taking into account of the fall out, or they would themselves draw a 
  line where to stop binding themselves with some ethical values. Of course 
  there is no limit of acquiring knowledge, nor there should be any imposed from 
  outside - even if knowledge is concerned with genetics. But it must also be 
  admitted that any attempt of changing the natural gene programming of human 
  being except in the case of deceased gene would be unethical and against the 
  natural course. Genetic engineers must obey some strict ethical laws and their 
  activity must be monitored constantly by the society and fellow genetic 
  scientists. We must draw a line of demarcation. To cure a gene affected 
  decease is most welcome; but to perform this engineering work he must be very 
  responsible- he must be warned; he must ensure himself that no gene must be 
  transplanted in those cells taking part in procreation. Transplantation of 
  gene in a procreation cell or in a newly fertilized cell must be treated as 
  illegal act in the law of the county- the law must be universally endorsed by 
  the international comity of nations. Because this doctoring effect would be 
  carried on from generation to generation thereby causing a change in the 
  otherwise natural hereditary process. </p>
  <p align="justify">The genetic inheritance is such a wealth that it embraces 
  the whole of the human race. There must not be any business with respect to 
  genetic engineering. Any attempt to change the natural process of our future 
  generation must be treated as a great offence. If any engineering or 
  interference were permitted the natural balance, equilibrium and unison of the 
  nature would be destroyed. The crown of evolution is the 'Homo sapiens', and 
  to preserve this species the scientists, social scientists, statesmen and the 
  ethical people have immense joint responsibility. We all must share this 
  responsibility collectively as well as individually. In this connection may we 
  remember the cautionary remark of Aatoan de Saint Ecsuperi ' </font>
  <font face="Verdana" color="#000080"><i>Man has indeed forgot one truth. But 
  you- yes you must not forget it. Whatever you achieved, it is your 
  responsibility and obligation to preserve it.</i></font><font face="Verdana">'
  </p>
  <p align="justify">Man has come very near to a door of infinite potentiality-, 
  on the one hand to him panoramic view of material is no more unknown; he knows 
  that the Universe was once created and the moment of time began; in this vast 
  macroscopic world holds the strict deterministic laws of theory of relativity. 
  But on the other hand to him the mystery of the microscopic world has been 
  unfolded, - this is the world of uncertainty - world of probability; governing 
  laws are due to quantum mechanics. Bioscience has revealed the mystery of 
  creation- it is not the God that has created the universe or life; this 
  science has revealed the laws of genetic sequence from generation to 
  generation. </p>
  <p align="justify">But I feel sad when we see that we, being a part of the 
  enlightened race of Homo sapiens, our society is confined within a small well, 
  full of contradictions, and ours is the society where free thinking is 
  restricted, not encouraged in every steps. We live in a society that is afraid 
  of Taslima Nasrin for her critical writings, demanding her trial, wants trial 
  of humanist Kabir Choudhury, of Shamsur Rahman, perhaps the greatest Bengali 
  poet of our time; the same society wanted to bar Begum Sufia Kamal from her 
  humanistic activities, the most dedicated lady of our time for the cause of 
  women and humanism, wanted to stop courageous thoughtful writer Ahmad Shariff 
  and declared him '<em>Murtad'</em>. This happens only in a society blind with 
  superstitions and has not yet assimilated message and philosophy of science.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">No body denies the utility of the holy books that have made 
  contribution to the human society in the past. But the words stated in those 
  books are the last words, the facts and truth narrated are the perpetual truth 
  for all time can not be accepted. If we do not search for knowledge, then 
  truth ceases and creativity withers away.</p>
  <p align="justify">The famous Bengali Scientist, Astrophysicist M. N. Saha 
  created a sensation in the scientific world when he discovered his famous 
  theory of thermal ionization. At that time a countryman of his (Dhakaite), a 
  man of scholar in old Vedic scriptures, asked Saha to explain to him about his 
  invention. Saha with his youthful exuberance tried to explain his contribution 
  in astrophysics and its far-reaching consequences. The gentleman was not 
  convinced nor charmed. He commented in his '<i>Dhakhaia dialect</i>', <i>&quot; </i>
  </font><font face="Arial"><font face="Verdana"><i>this is so! but nothing new 
  - these are all in Byada (Veda )&quot;</i> [&quot;Shobi Byade asey !&quot;].</font> Is the 
  number of such pundits rare in our society even today ? Perhaps number has 
  increased. A well known physicist of our country, known as well versed in 
  'Holy Quran' and a pundit of Islamic studies, is constantly preaching that 
  whatever modern science has discovered after toils of century after century of 
  greatest genius of the world, are found in the 'Holy Book'. If every truth, 
  every information every phenomenon is in the Holy Book then what is the use of 
  searching for knowledge - this is an automatic corollary. Our study should be 
  then confined to Quran and Hadis,- what is the point of studying Science 
  Journals like Physical Review or likes... because every thing is in the Holy 
  Book. Our only duty should be to issue f<i>atowa</i> which act is Quran-Hadis 
  permitted and which is not. My humble question is why then Imam Gazzali, 
  perhaps the greatest authority in Islamic Studies and learning could not 
  discover the laws of Gravity or Newtonian laws of motion. Why don't then our 
  Islamic Pundit Imam of Baitul Mukarram make an attempt to invent 'Quantum 
  Relativistic laws' we desperately need to describe both events of Macroscopic 
  world and of Microscopic world of atomic and sub-atomic world of uncertainty, 
  yes all events starting from the very moment of creation of the universe. Why 
  theoretical physicist Nobel Laureate Salam, a devoted Kadiani Muslim of 
  Pakistan could discover the unity of electro-weak forces of nature with 
  devoted research, just not practicing rituals prescribed in Quran, whereas a 
  devoted Sunni Muslim of great learning in Islamic Philosophy, Quran and Hadis 
  failed to do it if the theory of electro-weak field is contained in the Holy 
  Quran. Do I need to cite any more examples ! </p>
  <p align="justify">In our subcontinent, where the society is still blind with 
  superstitions and supernatural beliefs, when we need a progressive forward 
  looking and free thinking intellectuals for making the society open, liberal 
  and science oriented , the so called religionist scientists, engineers are the 
  hindrance to the society- they are trying to retrogress us in the backward 
  direction. A class of educated people, holding university degrees, is out to 
  establish the supernaturalism, transcendentalism, telepathy etc as scientific 
  by adopting some fraudulent methods including magic. Unfortunately this so 
  called educated class have within its fold physicists, chemists, 
  agriculturists, engineers, even doctors, and these people are the greatest 
  hindrance in making our society science oriented- a society based on reason 
  and logic, and our people to have scientific mind.</p>
