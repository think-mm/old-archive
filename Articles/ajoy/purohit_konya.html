  &nbsp;Myself together with freedom fighter Tareq Ali and Social leader Pankaj
  Bhattacharya day before yesterday (<st1:date Year="2003" Day="14"
Month="5">
  14<sup>th</sup> May, 2003</st1:date>
  ) went to the remote and inaccessible village Aruya, in Aruya union under the
  police station Shivalay to collect first hand information about the alleged
  sexual violence on a girl, daughter of a priest. We first went to Manikganj
  town, about 100 km from <st1:place>
  Dhaka</st1:place>
  where we were joined by local social leaders Dr. Chittaranjan Saha, Mir Abul
  Hosain, a retired government officer, Iqbal Hosen Kachi and Kafiluddin Ahmed.
  Together we went to see the SP of Manikganj. We were cordially received by his
  deputy ASP Haidari at the office of the SP. Haidari got in touch with the SP
  who expressed his regret not being able to meet us as he was on a spot visit
  away from the town. The ASP apprised us about the episode and admitted that
  the report of gang raping on the priest’s daughter seemed to be true. He
  immediate contacted the OC of Shivalay to extend all cooperation to us.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">We, on a microbus, took a diversion road from a spot
  about 10 km east of Aricha ghat on the <st1:Street>
  <st1:address>
  Manikgang-Aricha Highway</st1:address>
  </st1:Street>
  towards South. We straight drove about 16 km to arrive at Jhatka Bazar and
  from there to Misile Bazar another 11 km south-east. From the Bazar we took
  rickshaws as there were no more motorable road. Within 10 minutes we reached
  on the bank of a small stream ‘<i>Ichhamati</i>’ which we crossed with our
  vehicles on country boats. After about another 15 minutes rickshaw drive we
  left the rickshaws to walk down to the residence of the priest not less than
  two kilometers. under the scorching summer sun. It was evident that the
  locality is lowland, which gets immersed during rainy season as we moved 20
  feet up to reach the base or premise of the house of the priest. We arrived
  the residence of the priest at last at about <st1:time Minute="0"
Hour="12">
  12 noon</st1:time>
  .<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><u><span style="color:green">Two hours at the residence
  of the priest<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></u></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Mr. Khondkar Shafiqul Alam, the OC of Shivalay police
  station and his team received us. We were also attended by the UP Chairman
  Saifur Rahman Khan Sultan and the local UP member Jabbar Mian. We talked to
  Mr. Shyamal Chakrabarty, father of the victim- Shilpi Chakrabarty and the
  mother in private in a room where the incident took place. Shilpi also talked
  to us – but we didn’t ask her about the incident as it was a very delicate
  matter, but she admitted that on the dreadful night she was attacked by 4 and
  5 miscreants. She could recognize them. There are two separate houses forming
  an L each with a single room. The premise was quite open with mango- and other
  trees.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">According to her parents on <st1:date Year="2003" Day="28"
Month="4">
  28<sup>th</sup> April 2003</st1:date>
  just after <st1:time Minute="0"
Hour="0">
  midnight</st1:time>
  10-15 young men armed with lethal weapons broke into the room facing east
  where the father, mother and the girl were sleeping. 3 or 4 attackers forcibly
  drag out the priest from the room and tied him to a nearby mango tree with a
  rope. They were demanding a sum of 50 thousand taka (US $ 1000 approximately)
  from Mr. Chakrabarty who expressed his inability to give them such a huge
  amount on that night. They threatened him of dire consequence if he did not
  comply with their demand; if he failed they would take her daughter away. Then
  two miscreants started beating him with a solid rod on his body; in the
  process he received severe injury on his left arm, which he showed to us. I
  was surprised to know that the attackers include his tenant (bargadar) Akkas
  Ali (alias Aku Gazi). The term <i>baragadar</i> means a lessee holding a piece
  of land under the condition that a fixed portion of crop will be paid as
  revenue to the owner of the land. In the mean while another two or three
  assaulters forcibly entered the room facing south breaking the door and
  attacked the elder son of the priest. They prevented him coming out of the
  room to rescuing his father and inmates.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In the meanwhile the other members of the attackers
  remaining inside the first room where the mother and the victim were trembling
  with fear threatened the mother that if the priest did not give them Tk 50
  thousand they would lift his daughter. According to the mother of the victim
  the daughter was holding her with two hands and crying out of fear and begging
  mercy. According to her mother they using filthy language said, “We will
  kill you all, if you don’t give us 50 thousand taka. You will give either
  money or the daughter”. At this stage the poor mother to save her
  daughter’s honour and dignity of the family agreed to pay the sum on the
  next day. She said to them that they would try to sell some lands to collect
  the money. The two miscreants then forcibly drag the mother out of the room
  and held her back. Then another group of miscreants entered the room. At this
  stage the mother begged them not to maltreat her daughter- and promised to
  comply with whatever they demand, but ‘<i><span style="color:maroon">Amar
  meyeke tomra sparsa korona, tomra ya chao tai debo (Please don’t touch my
  daughter, whatever you want I will give you)</span></i>’ – cried the
  middle aged lady. But who listened to her call for mercy, praying to gods; her
  pathetic cry and groaning only saddened the night sky and the air surrounding
  the house of the poor priest. The reply came immediately in response to <i><span style="color:maroon">whatever
  you want to</span></i> and showed what they want instantly!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Then what happened- don’t ask me to narrate. The act
  of en masse raping continued for hours till each and every one satisfied his
  lust for sexual hunger. The girl could recognize at least a few of them and
  begged for mercy in vain. The poor and wretched girl at one stage lost her
  senses and collapsed. The mother just at the doorstep witnessing her
  daughter’s agony and pain could not bear any more. She also became
  unconscious. Not a single person from the locality had the courage to come
  forward nor could the neighbours organize a defence for the poor victim
  family. After a few hours just before dawn the assaulters left the premise
  untying the priest and reminding him to pay their demand as soon as possible.
  They also threatened him not to lodge any complain either to the police or to
  the leaders of the village- “<i><span style="color:maroon">if you do so, we
  will come again</span></i>”- reported the poor priest Shyamal Chakravorty
  with tears in his eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The image of Lord Shiva, the god of destruction- also
  called Pashupatinath, was just adjacent to the house wherein the beasts in
  human form were performing the heinous crime but Lord failed to protect his
  worshipers. Lord Shiva might say in his defence, ‘I am the lord of the
  beasts not of the beasts in human form’. The local gods were more powerful
  than the gods living in heaven. I deeply felt for the poor girl who at least
  every year on the sacred occasion of the day of Shiva-Chaturdashi pouring milk
  on the head of Shiva must have been praying to Lord Shiva for a good husband
  for her. Even the all powerful Allah, the almighty, omnipresence, the absolute
  merciful did not come to the rescue of the poor girl, rather He just saw His
  followers committing the unpardonable crime in absolute silence! If the poor
  girl ask now “does Shiva exist, is Allah all merciful or does He exist? Did
  the God create us or we created Him ?” Who will answer this agonizing
  question of the poor girl?</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The poor girl is Shilpi, - yes she looks like an
  artist, innocent looking with a typical charm and grace of a Bengali girl. As
  we saw her she appeared mentally shocked but with definite sign of recovering
  from the experience of that dreadful night. She talked to us with soft voice
  steadily and gave intelligent answers to our endless queries but avoiding any
  personal question or asking her about the dreadful experience. She herself
  told us that she had no idea that men could be such inhuman beasts. She also
  received some physical injuries including a head injury of a torch-strike from
  one of the beasts; she is now under medical treatment. When we tried to
  inspire her saying that she should not think that she has become impure as
  this anti social crime had been committed by some anti-socials in which she
  had nothing to do, she kept mum for a while then replied with tears “<i><span style="color:maroon">how
  can I forget it, Jyataha (a term used in Bangla to indicate elder brother of
  the father), but I would definitely try to stand on my feet. Please bless me
  to do that. Be on my side</span></i>.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
  promised us to continue her study. She is a student of class X reading at
  local Malati Bahumukhi Uchcha Vidyalay.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">We all blessed her with deep sincerity and tears in our
  eyes. But to how many we can reach personally and utter such empty reassuring
  blessings- numbers are increasing alarmingly. And we know deep in our heart
  that we are as helpless as they are. This question as coming from Shiilpi is
  the questtion of Purnimas, Ritas, Rezinas, Rajufas ..... and hundreds and
  thousands like them “Where lies its end ?”. Do we know the answer really
  or the way to stop it ? At least I think our social leaders, our civil
  society, our politicians.. have any answer !</p>

  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The family
  headed by priest Shyamal Chakravorty, a middle aged man seemed to be well
  respected and relatively well to do. He has 12 Phakis ( 1 Phaki = 30 decimals)
  i.e. 360 decimals cultivable lands. Most of these lands are being cultivated
  by the system known as <i>barga</i>. Barga-system of cultivation is a
  temporary lease of land on conciliation that a fixed portion of crop will be
  paid as revenue. Shyamal Babu earns his livelihood through practicing
  priesthood – a profession followed by a class of Brahmins who perform Hindu
  rituals associated with Hindu way of life such as worshiping of deities,
  marriages and many other Hindu festivals. Shyamal Babu, father of two sons and
  only daughter being youngest, have two brothers – elder one Babu Ashutosh
  Chakaravorty, assistant head pundit of Gaibandha government school and younger
  one Babu Ramen Chakravorty, an officer in the office of AC land. The family
  has some land dispute with one Nabin Pramanik who grabbed about 12 decimal of <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  land</st1:PlaceType>
  of <st1:PlaceName>
  Shyamal</st1:PlaceName>
  </st1:place>
  Babu. The case of the dispute was dismissed when the two parties agreed to
  come to a settlement. But when the demarcation was made properly by a
  settlement officer the other party refused to accept it, and after a few days
  the line of demarcation was dismantled; Nabin Pramanik took forcible control
  over the disputed land once again.</p>

  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Initially police was reluctant to take the case as a
  powerful coterie in the name of compromise and settlement tried to hush up the
  entire episode. Bewildered father took the help of the UP chairman and a local
  UP member with whose initiative the police became active and arrested two
  culprits, at the instruction of the SP Manikganj, before the formal case was
  filed. On the following day i.e. 29<sup>th</sup> April afternoon a case was
  formally filed under criminal penal code section 9(3)/30, of Act of coercion
  against repression on Women and Children of 2000. The case number is 25 dated
  29. 04. 03 at Shibalay police station. The OC told us that although
  investigation has been progressing they are convinced that this is a case of
  gang raping and local anti social elements are involved in it. Mr. Khondkar
  Shafiqul Islam, an young energetic officer assured us that a through
  investigation is on and they have appealed to the appropriate authority to
  take up the case in rapid action special tribunal. The plaintiff is the victim
  herself and there are four accused so far : Akkas Ali alias Aku Gazi, s/o late
  Akali Gazi, Mannan, s/o Balai Sheikh, Lutfar Rahman, s/o Nabin Pramanik (with
  whom the priest has land dispute), Shahadat Hosen Khadu, s/o Waziuddin. The OC
  further informed us that although clinical and medical examinations were done
  its report not yet arrived. However the police at Shibalay have received
  report of the chemical examination of forensic department at <st1:place>
  Dhaka</st1:place>
  . And its report is convincing and positive.</p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><u><span style="color:green">Reaction of the villagers </span></u><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">When we visted the village a large number of common
  villagers accompanied us – many acted as volunteering guides. The up
  chairman was upset at the incidence and told us that priest is an honest man
  and well respected. He opined that misguided youths and an interested coterie
  out of greed of grabbing the property committed this violent crime. He assured
  us that he would see that the wretched family is not humiliated any more.
  Jabbar Mian newly elected union parisad chairman also expressed the same
  opinion. He said the village is traditionally a peaceful- we live in harmony
  with different communities with no trouble. Only a handful of professional <i>goondas</i>
  and hooligans create this kind of social problems occasionally. One common
  villager, a bearded gentleman declaring himself as Chand Shekh, expressed his
  indignation over the entire incident and asked for extreme punishment. He said
  if the punishment is not given to anti-socials they would go to extreme, in
  fact they have already gone. And gentle and timid families like those of
  Shyamal Chakravorty would have to leave the village for good. With a pleasant
  surprise I met a student of mine Shankar Prasad Bhowmik at the <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Dahka</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  University</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  . According him the main objective, though a greed for property, was to create
  a panicky situation with atrocious activities so that family leaves the
  country to <st1:country-region>
  <st1:place>
  India</st1:place>
  </st1:country-region>
  . This would enable them to grab the abandoned property with ease. He
  emphatically opined that this is a message to all minority families living
  here. When I asked him how many families are in the village; only seven and in
  the adjacent village Dhanapara another ten, he answered. He further informed
  that situation was not that bad, even one or two decades before- a sizable
  number Hindu families used to live in here, he lamented. The situation is a
  familiar picture through out <st1:country-region>

  Amzad Hosen what and how do they feel about the incident. Both said that

  motive behind the incident was to terrorize the minority family, as they are
  easily susceptible to pressure so that the family flee away to <st1:country-region>

  They also opined that the culprits should be brought to justice. But would the
  justice come to the rescue of Shilpi ? Who knows.<o:p>
