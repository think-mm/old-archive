  <p>Attention mukto-mona@yahoogroups.com</p>
  <p>Dear Muktomonas,</p>
  <p>Justice Debesh Bhattacharya breathed his last peacefully yesterday (2nd
  February, 04) evening in a Gulshan clinic quietly while the nation was
  celebrating Eid ul Azha. I am sure you will join me paying our due respect to
  yet another great son of Bangladesh. I pay my deep respect through this
  posting.</p>

  Debesh Chandra Bhattacharya Passed away Peacefully</b></font><b></o:p>
  </b></span></p>
  <p>Justice Debesh Bhattacharya, an well respected personality of the
  Bangladesh Supreme court and Bar, a veteran humanist and human right leader, a
  well reputed lawyer and really most honoured Justice (retired) the Supreme
  court passed away peacefully yesterday, 2nd February, 2004 on the day of Eid
  ul Azha. He was more than 85, when he breathed his last in a Gulshan clinic.</p>
  <p>To common people like me he was a famous lawyer and a constitutional
  expert, a most respectful Justice of the Supreme Court, a relentless fighter
  against fanaticism &amp; communalism and a guide-philosopher in need, but to
  his comrades and co-fighters he was lovingly called as ‘Debesh da’.</p>
  <p>The retired justice has been suffering from various illnesses for past
  several years following severe brain stroke. He has been leading an invalid
  life, unable to move, talk freely, and even do his personal things. A terrible
  life indeed. His wife, we call as per Bengali tradition ‘ardhangini ’,
  meaning half of the body, has been looking after him alone for these few
  years. According to Hindu cultural and religious tradition, a man is
  incomplete until a marriage is solemnized with a woman. The marriage brings
  two half units a complete union, Yaya o Pati, dampati. Mrs. Chitra Devi on her
  own right a well known social worker. She was an MP in the last jatiya sansad.
  His eldest son Dr. Debapriya Bhattacharya, a well known economist of the
  country works in Centre for Policy Dialogue, Dhaka as its Executive director,
  another son Dipen Bhattacharya, a Physicist is in University of California,
  USA.</p>
  <p>This great son of Bangladesh, a firm believer of liberal democracy was
  associated with many human rights activities, a father figure of Hindu-Boudha-Christian
  Oikya Parisad, President of Ramkrishna Math, Dhaka, Pravartak, Chittagong etc.
  etc.. His loud voice was always heard whenever a women or a minority were
  exposed to repression. He led the movement for repeal of the infamous vested
  property act that reduced the members of the minority community to second
  grade citizens. He also initiated a movement for enacting Hindu code bill for
  Bangladeshi Hindus with a aim to abolish castes and equality of women in the
  social order of Hinduism with their male counter parts. I saw many of his
  writings on the issue. But unfortunately, this made him controversial; many
  orthodox Hindu leaders criticized his opinions.</p>
  <p>I read his two excellent articles on vested property act shading light how
  this discriminatory act made minorities to second class status in national
  life and how the old and traditional elite minority families were being
  harassed by the government servants and local influential quarters:</p>
  <p>1. Enemy Property (vested) Property Law in Bangladesh – D. C.
  Bhattacharya, (published by Mrs. Chitra Bhattacharya, 1991) 2. Nature and
  Character of Enemy (vested) Properties – D. C. Bhattacharya, (Paper
  presented in a meeting organized by Sampradayik Sampriti Parisad, 1994)</p>
  <p>I vividly remember his courageous and undaunted role criticizing the then
  government, which failed to stop repression, and torture let loose by the
  fundamentalist forces on the minorities following the destruction of Babri
  mosque in Uttar Pradesh (India). I remember under the auspicious of Bangladesh
  Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Unity Council a press conference was held on 4th
  January, 1993 in the Press Club to protest the atrocities committed on the
  minority communities as a consequence of Babri Masjid fall out. Justice
  Bhattacharya was the key figure in the press conference. And I am sure, the
  well written press statement, couched with facts and figures, restrained from
  emotion and agony, must had been drafted by him. The statement began with,</p>
  <p>“Dear Journalists friends,</p>
  <p>We are assembled here with a heavy heart full of sorrow and pain. We are
  utterly aggrieved and compounded now. The recent act of barbarism unleashed by
  a section of communal forces on the minority groups had once again not only
  hurt the spirit of the great Liberation War and national unity, but also
  forced us to face cruel reality.</p>
  <p>....... ...</p>
  <p>It was unprecedented that raising the issue of another country the repeated
  attack and atrocities indulged on the minority groups had opened a shameful
  chapter in the history of mankind. You are the conscious community of the
  nation. So, we want to inform the world community about our distress through
  your objective writings. .....</p>
  <p>..... .....</p>
  <p>According to available information, thousands of temples, places of
  worships, commercial establishments and houses were badly damaged, valuables
  looted and set ablaze by the said fanatic group. ......</p>
  <p>Thousands of people are living under open sky without food, shelter and
  clothings for days together. Businessmen are moving empty handed loosing their
  asset. Hundreds of women have become mum losing chastity as they were
  violated. A sense of insecurity is prevailing among the people of the minority
  community. The people belonging to the fanatic groups are threatening the
  minority groups of serious consequences and extorting money what they have,
  occupying their lands and properties and even forcing them to convert into
  Islam. “</p>
  <p>The statement ended with a 7-point charter of demand, which are as follows:
  1. Immediate reconstruction of the damaged temples, places of worship and
  religious institutions. 2. adequate compensation to the affected people; 3.
  providing relief materials to the distressed people ensuring their
  rehabilitation; 4. examplary punishment to those responsible for the
  incidents; 5. proper measures against the willful silence and inactiveness of
  the administration; 6. ban on politics of the communal forces and 7. amicable
  and permanent solution to the problems of the minority groups in the greater
  interest of the nation.</p>
  <p>...... The sense of insecurity and uncertainty that engulfed the minority
  groups would not be eliminated only through speeches and assurances but
  through pragmatic constitutional and political steps. Otherwise we fear, the
  national unity and integrity would be at stake. “</p>
  <p>What the late justice feared a decade ago, the situation in BD as regards
  the peril of minority people worsening with geometric progression in today’s
  Bangladesh although we have received certificate of being a Moderate Moslem
  State, whatever that means.</p>
  <p>Although, personally I was never very close to him, I had always deep
  regards and profound respects for this humanist dhrambatar, we lovingly used
  to call Bicharpati Debesh Bhattacharya. Let me pay my humble homage by paying
  tribute at the feet of this beloved son of Bangladesh.</p>
  <p>Ps: I hurriedly wrote this tribute. If I could collect more information, I
  would surely write up an obituary fairly in detail for you, the freethinkers.</p>
