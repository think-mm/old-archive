	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From our 
	foregoing analysis, it has become apparently clear that voter-list (draft) 
	contained a large number of unknown voters. At the same time quite a 
	significant numbers of newly eligible voters were included, and many old 
	voters were dropped although they their eligibility was not lost. Our 
	estimation gives that in no case number of voters in 2006 should exceed 71 
	millions as against Azizian magic number 91 millions. The fake voters then 
	turn out to be ~ <span style="color:maroon">20 millions</span>. According to 
	a report of a leading Bangla daily, Pratham Alo (06. 05. 06) number of fake 
	voters might be around <span style="color:maroon">15 millions</span>. The 
	report further said that number of genuine voters dropped out from the list 
	might around 400,000. The figure could be still large. On the basis of the 
	report the number of voters would be 76.5 millions adding about 50,000 
	dropped voters. The figure is not very far from our estimated one. We raised 
	the question how this large number of unknown voters (20 – 15 millions) got 
	enlisted without the knowledge and cooperation of the election commission? 
	The full responsibility lies on the shoulder of the CEC. The CEC once said 
	that he and his office is a mere post box, indicating that the commission is 
	not an independent body, but is controlled by an ‘out side Postmaster 
	General’. How silly the comment is? It is alleged by different sectors that 
	in making this list the election commission might have adopted the following 
	mechanism, which was cleverly and intelligently devised by the CEC and his 
	collaborators at the instance of 4-party alliance as a whole with the 
	logistic support from the government and its obedient bureaucracy: </font>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The plan also 
	envisaged that minority voters in general, and especially in the minority

	allies. The Pratham Alo report said that these dropped out voters (40/50 
	lakhs) are distributed in locality of Chittagong, Khulna, and Rajshahi, even 
	Dhaka. Who were those unfortunate voters ? The Pratham Alo provided the 
	answer through its editorial (12. 05. 06) saying these voters were of 
	minority communities, people either not supporting the pro government allied 
	political parties and or people supporting the opposition parties. We may 
	add to another elements who outspokenly, directly or indirectly believes in 
	secular society and secular state system. As we pointed out in the part 1 of 
	the article that our own analysis and reports published in national dailies 
	some facts of about fake voters. We reproduce those facts for ready

		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Not less than 65 lakhs (650 thousands) of genuine voters have been

		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		In more than 76 constituencies an unnatural increase of voters have been

		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		In some areas, (e.g. Bogra, Sayidpur.. ..) many local genuine voters 
		were not left out, however, most of the interned Pakistani citizens 
		(known as Beharis) were made voters. In two localities Dhunat and 
		Sariakandi (within the district of Bogra), a large number of voters from 
		not less than 17 non-existent villages have been recorded. In Dhunat

	followed everywhere. In Gazipur district the position of opposition has been 
	traditionally very strong. In order to unbalance it with a view to occupy 
	the constituencies the planner increased the voters by 35% to ensure the 
	victory of BNP or BNP backed Islamite candidates. But the real bombshell 
	came from Mr. Maudud Ahmed, our clever law minister. Recently while visiting 
	his own constituency alleged that rigging of voter list happened alleging 
	the number as high as 4,000 plus in many areas duplication of name also took 
	place. He however added hurriedly saying those ‘mistakes’ could be rectified 
	assuring that he would inform the CEC. To this our spineless CEC remarked 
	that he had heard the remark of the law minister, bit the commission did not 
	receive any written allegation from the minister. It has been alleged that 
	in Kompaniganj Upazila in the district of Noakhali as many as 400 fake 
	voters were enlisted by the supervisor himself. Three information collecting 
	workers brought this allegation to the UNO who has fixed up a date of 
	hearing. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana"><u>
	<span style="text-decoration: none; color: maroon">&nbsp;</span></u></font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is an 
	interesting story that provides us yet another example how the EC executed 
	its plan to include non-existing persons in the list. One Mr. Aminul Haque, 
	a freedom fighter and an assistant head master of Sher e Bangla Government 
	High School got an appointment by the EC to act as an assistant registration 
	officer (ARO) in the ward 41 of Paschim Agargaon, Dhaka. His gas the 
	authority to appoint local workers for information collection in a 
	prescribed form for enlisting would be voters. In the meanwhile one Mr. 
	Atiqul Islam after obtaining an appointment as information collecting worker 
	made a list of 900 voters within ward 41, the jurisdiction of said Mr. 
	Aminul Haque. When he went to Mr. Haque, the local assistant registration to 
	deliver the list for enlisting these 900 votes in the voter list, the ARO 
	refused to accept the list on the plea that he did not know Mr. Islam as he 
	had not appointed him for the job in his ward. Being refused, Mr. Islam went 
	to election officer Mrs. Afroza Khanam of the area of Muhammadpur police 
	station, who in turn gave written directives to Mr. Aminul Haque to take the 
	list of 900 persons from Atiqul asking ARO to include these names in the 
	draft voter list as Mr. Islam was directly appointed by EC. The concerned 
	ARO kept the list but not complying with the order of the EO of Muhammadpur 
	on the ground that listed persons are not inhabitants of the locality. The 
	Dhaka district election officer 3, Mr. Shamsul Alam on April 2, issued a 
	directive to the ARO to enlisting those 900 names in the list collected by 
	Atiqul Islam. Once again the ARO refused the order, and made the event 
	public through saying that the high officials for inclusion of 900 fake 
	voters were subjecting him to pressure. The matter created sensation. The 
	election commission asked the ARO to return the list of 900 to the election 
	commission’s office. But he stubbornly resisted apprehending those names 
	might be included in the list from top or might be tampered. But he was 
	harassed and even threatened from different corners. Courageous Mr. Haque 
	instead of surrendering to the pressure of CEC, sought the protection of the 
	HC by filing a writ petition to the bench on May 21, 2006. The petitioner 
	sought the permission of the bench to submit the alleged 900 fake voters to 
	the HC and prayed for his personal protection. The petitioner in brief 
	narrated that EC issued a letter on May 18, 2006 asking him to appoint one 
	Atiqul Islam, a known BNP leader in the locality as an information collector 
	with back date. The letter further asked the ARO to enlist 900 voters 
	prepared by Mr. Islam. The inquiry committee formed by the EC to look into 
	the matter is in fact designed to punish him (ARO), Mr. Haque said in his 
	petition. The HC bench constituted of Justice MA Matin and ATM Fazle Bari 
	issued an order to IGP Abdul Qayum to collect the list of 900 voters and 
	submit to the court immediately. The bench further issued an order not to 
	arrest or harass the petitioner ARO Aminul Haque except on specific charge. 
	The HC issued there rules to the Government and the EC to the effect why (1) 
	instruction of EC to appoint Atiqul Islam from back date and (2) 
	constitution of inquiry committee against ARO would not be declared illegal 
	and unlawful. The HC set the time limit to reply was three weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	According to our constitution the EC, being a constitutional body, cannot

	High Court bringing in charge of contempt of court against the CEC and his 
	two colleagues and acting secretary of the EC secretariat (Muhammad Zakaria) 
	because they flouted the HC verdict by refusing to act as per directives of

	The verdict of the Supreme Court full bench headed by chief justice Syed IR 
	Mudassir Hossain rejected CEC’s ‘leave to appeal’, thus upholding the HC

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Barrister 
	Rokanuddin Ahmed and Barrister Amirul Islam expressed the same opinion 
	adding that on the basis of such fake and illegal electoral rolls no 
	election could be held. Advocate TII Khan and Advocate Khondker Mahbubuddin 
	Ahmed declined to make any comment. Erstwhile EC Mr. AK Mohammad Ali 
	commenting on the SC verdict said, ‘it is an epoch making judgment. But the 
	chief heroes of the ‘Fake Electoral Roll’ the CEC and his two colleagues 
	kept mum and refused to see the journalists. But on their behalf some low 
	level officials told the journalists that as soon as the verdict of the SC 
	arrive the next step of action would be undertaken as per the verdict.

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even after the 
	slap he received the faceless CEC continued to hold his office with his 
	colleagues against the general public sentiment and oppositions’ demand ‘to 
	step down immediately’. But the CEC is holding on the plea that the verdict 
	of the Supreme Court has not arrived, though he expressed his desire to obey 
	the verdict toto to the USA Ambassador. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The chief 
	opposition AL and its 11 party alliances demanded CEC’s resignation 
	immediately and categorically said that under the present set up the EC they 
	would not take part in the election. Even the law minister Mr. Madud seemed 
	to be got annoyed with strange behaviour of the CEC. He said there is no 
	scope but give effect of the HC verdict following what the SC said on the 
	issue. He however said whether the CEC would resign or not entirely his 
	matter, “I cannot ask him to do so.” Mr. Mannan Bhuiyan commented, ‘it is up 
	to him whether the CEC would resign or not. There is enough time make an up 
	to date list. It is not a serious matter.”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Who will be 
	responsible for spending at least 600 millions of Taka for this futile 
	exercise from the public money ? The CEC must come straight with a straight 
	answer. If he tries again to do hanky panky with the public money he will 
	invite more troubles for him as well as for the country. This man, called 
	himself a justice already ruined the reputation of the most respectable body 
	the election commission. The huge amount in fact went down the drain for 
	CEC’s arrogance not to obey the HC verdict but to go ahead with his plan to 
	make a fresh list of voters for the ensuing election. To do the job the 
	commission had employed over three lakh strong manpower through the country. 
	It is learnt that remuneration to be paid to them is over due. These 
	workers, mostly BNP and Jamat cadres, are now suffering from uncertainty. It 
	is alleged that to make a fresh voters’ list the EC submitted a budget over 
	around 1500 millions taka in August last year to the finance ministry, but 
	being asked to cut it short it submitted a fresh estimation of Tk 1200 
	millions. The ministry released a sum of Tk 600 millions in the first phase. 
	The EC source said that the EC secretariat had spent most of the sum for 
	printing huge number of manuals, voter register forms and for training 
	programme of the officials and field workers. A sum of Tk 270 millions were 
	allocated for remuneration of 2,16,722 enumerators and 55,684 supervisors. 
	Another Tk 270 millions would be needed for the full payment. Where from 
	this money would come after the SC verdict ? – a one thousand dollar 
	question. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The EC through 
	its acting secretary declared in a press conference that it had spent Tk 370 
	millions in connection with fresh voter list. They disclosed it as the 
	finance ministry asked the commission to return the unspent money with 
	detail account by the end of the fiscal year. Out of this Tk 370 millions, 
	Tk 100 millions have been spent on various heads, and Tk 270 millions kept 
	for remuneration of the persons associated with the job. The EC secretariat 
	has now Tk 230 millions unspent. Whether this balance sheet would be 
	acceptable to the finance ministry and the auditor general is any body’s 
	guess. But the expenditure of such a huge amount without moral ground has 
	shaken the CEC and his secretariat. CEC is now at the mercy of the 
	government, especially of the PM Begum Khaleda. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the meanwhile 
	the 14 party opposition alliance threatened that they would file a 
	corruption case against the CEC and his team for spending a huge amount of 
	public money for making fake voter list defying the HC verdict and 
	instructions. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many had 
	expected that any man in his place having little respect would have resigned 
	and publicly apologize for his mistake. Dr. Kamal Hossain also expected him 
	to do so if he had some conscience. But this is what the CEC Mr. MA Aziz is 
	devoid of. If Khaleda wants him to go he would, but perhaps Khaleda still 
	needs him. So the CEC hangs on despite countrywide demand for his 
	resignation. </font></p>
