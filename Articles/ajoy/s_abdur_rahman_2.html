	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 31 
	hour tense but government sponsored stage drama is ended when the JMB 
	spiritual leader sayekh Abdur Rahman tamely surrendered as planed to the 
	combined force composed of RAB, police and BDR this morning at 7.30 a.m. 
	Early in the morning at about 6 a.m. the combine battalion resumed its 
	operation against the JMB leader. The leader of the combined force once 
	again asked Rahman repeatedly for half a to give himself up. He was assured 
	of his life’s security, good treatment and proper legal help if he comes out 
	of the house with his two companions un-armed. At about 7 a.m. Sayekh Rahman 
	appeared at the grilled window on the left side of the house as one faces 
	it. He asked for a dialogue with the media for negotiation of his condition 
	of surrender. It was told to him that this arrangement could be made once he 
	comes out of the house unarmed and unclothed. Then a few minutes of lull 
	followed and he vanished inside the house once again. Earlier he accused the 
	force as intruder who snapped the electricity, water and gas supply; he also 
	accused them starving his family to death. He asked the force withdraw from 
	the premise so that he can come out safe and have a dialogue with press and 
	electronic media. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">At 
	about 7.30 a.m. Sayekh Abdur Rahman with his two accomplices, Hriday and 
	Abdul Aziz finally came out of his residence, the Surya Dighal Bari at 
	Shaplabag in the locality of Tilagar within the city. The locality is 
	infamous for inhabited by top Jamati leaders and their followers and 
	antisocial elements. Police then entered the house and got hold of some 
	explosives, a few CDs of Maulana Sayedi and a few books written by Golum 
	Azam. but little ammunitions or grenades or bombs. The Police, however, 
	arrested them on the charge of possessing arms, ammunitions and explosive 
	materials. This is just a routine charge. He, his family members and other 
	accomplices were taken to RAB 9 head quarter where they were interrogated. 
	At about 10-30 a.m. Sayekh and his co-accused were produced before a Sylhet 
	court which granted 10 day police remand for intensive interrogation. It is 
	learnt that Sayekh was receiving almost VIP treatment so far at the hands of 
	the RAB authority at Uttara. He was then on his way to Dhaka, finally 
	reaching RAB 1 head quarter in Dhaka.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	arrest drama of Sayekh Rahman has arisen a few questions:</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="1" type="1">
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Is it a stage managed drama ? The circumstances under which he 
		surrendered indicate that. </font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		It has been claimed that the JMB leader has been living in the Shaplabag 
		house for over a month openly, but police, RAB or our intelligent 
		persons failed to locate him so long is simply unbelievable. Probably an 
		understanding was made between the government and JMB through his 
		mentors in 4-party alliance, especially Jamati leaders in the 
		government. It is likely that the home ministry under Mr. Babar played 
		an important role in the surrender drama. Is it a farfetched imagination 
		? I believe not. </font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Perhaps condition of surrender was that Sayekh would surrender through a 
		stage managed drama for which he would be charged with minor offences so 
		that ultimately his life would saved through legal procedure. </font>
		</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Once the negotiation has been finalized behind the scene a drama of 
		Surya Dighal Bari was planned very skillfully that we witnessed for the 
		last 31 hours starting from 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday (28<sup>th</sup> 
		February 2006) ending on Friday (2<sup>nd</sup> March ) at 7.30 a.m.
		</font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		After the plan was approved one Top JMB leader (ranking 3), Hafez Mahmud 
		was sent to Dhaka to be arrested from Baitul Mokarram on 27<sup>th</sup> 
		February before the drama was green signaled to go ahead. The RAB, 
		Police and BDR moved in the scene with lightning speed. </font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		Question is if the drama is not stage managed then why a revolutionary 
		leader like Sayekh, who is the real effective man and leader of the JMB 
		and other Islamic revolutionary movement for materializing Islamiat in 
		Bangladesh would live in an open house openly with his wife, daughter, 
		grand children just to wait for police to come and arrest him? This is a 
		million dollar question we must face. The house was not well protected, 
		not well fortified, secured. He did not have with him a team of 
		effective guards or accomplices, nor the he had large amount of arms and 
		ammunitions and explosive devices. As if he was waiting for the law 
		enforcing agencies to appear, and he did tamely surrendered, although he 
		uttered some warnings that ‘I will not surrender to you, I will 
		surrender only to the almighty Allah.’ All these prove empty sound, and 
		were part of the preplanned game as were the so-called police-bdr-rab 
		operation. </font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		The most burning question is with whose help and cooperation the 
		Spiritual leader of JMB could live with his wife, sons, and grand 
		children almost openly from one place to another within Bangladesh, 
		although his head has a value Tk 50 lakhs, determined by the government. 
		Is he spiritual leader of only JMB or others too, including members of 
		the some ruling parties?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></li>
	</ol>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">But it 
	is a well-performed drama. Thanks to our planner. Ramendu Majumdar, Mamunir 
	Rashid, Ali Zaker et al have many things to learn from the drama director we 
	saw for 31 hours. The Drama may be called ‘Surya Dighal Bari’- a new 
	version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">As 
	expected our PM has hailed the arrest of Sayekh, her Islamic adviser in 
	Islamic affairs in disguise, who operated through the Matiur Rahman Nizani 
	and gong of Jamat I Islami. On the other hand the opposition leaders of 14 
	party alliance including AL chief termed the event of JMB leaders surrender 
	as preplanned and stage-managed. </font></p>
