  <span style="font-family: Verdana">A few years back the Islamic 
  fundamentalists blasted Udichi’s Cultural function with high power bombs and 
  other explosive devices during AL regime in which several persons including a 
  political leader were killed. AL government arrested many fundamentalists and 
  police made charge sheets against many including a top BNP leader, once so 
  called leftist. Then the Jamat and its natural ally BNP made hew and cry that 
  the police, at the instance of the AL government un-necessarily harassing the 
  innocent and religious persons. They at that time charged that it is AL, which 
  had done this in order to divert the public attention. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">After the change over of the government 
  following a “Land Slide” victory started playing a record that all terrorist 
  activities during AL regime were done by Awami goondas and miscreants. The 
  Islamic fundamentalists and Mullahs or followers were clean, peace loving and 
  true followers of Islam had no connection with those men killing missions. The 
  propaganda wanted us to believe that secularists were killing secularists. The 
  Khaleda-Nizami government appointed one man commission under a pro-government 
  spineless retired judge in his report said that it was the Awami leaguers who 
  were responsible for grenade or bomb explosions aiming at&nbsp; Udichi, Btamul, CPB 
  and even Naryangan AL office. The learned justice served very faithfully his 
  appointer and recorded verbatim what our great Lady and the alliance wanted to 
  be reflected. </span></p>

  <span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">We have never accepted Khaleda or Nizami’s 
  version of fact, although we were critical of AL government’s failure to push 
  thrust against the fundamentalists to take them to task. We the secularists 
  had no doubt those were the work of communal forces who carried out the 
  mission to unsettle the secular AL government, which they precisely did 
  through a skillfully doctored election of 2001’, alas, in which most liberal 
  country USA under president Bush junior, and our neighbor the biggest 
  democratic country India under BJP government had due share to the 
  Khaleda-Nizami Islamic government to power. Since then religious minorities, 
  ethnic-linguistic-cultural small races and secular-democrats are being exposed 
  to torture, persecution and threat. Now these fundamentalists under the direct 
  patronage of Khaleda’s BNP, Nizami’s Jamat I Islami and other communal and 
  religious Mullahs are out to eliminate the democratic secular people, destroy 
  all our democratic and secular values in relation of state functionaries like- 
  administration, judiciary, education and our pluralistic 
  culture-heritage-history-tradition. The aim of these talebani branded Islamite 
  is to turn Bangladesh a monolithic country where Kattar and only Kattar Islam 
  only prevail, nothing else- no science, no reason, no logic, no philosophy, no 
  inquisitiveness, no free thinking. Only source of knowledge is Quran and Hadis.

  <span style="font-family: Verdana">We predicted, following the take over of 
  pro-Islamic power to state power under the leadership of BNP’s Mrs. Khaleda 
  Rahman and Jamat I Islmai’s Matiur Rahman Nizami, that dark days for 
  secularism, democracy and pluralism- they will be persecuted by using state 
  powers in one hand by letting loose the Islamic militants and mastans of BNP, 
  Chhatradal, and Jamat &amp; its front Islami Chhatra Shibir. How prophetic we

  <h2><b><font face="Verdana" size="3">Netrokona Massacre and Yadav Theory</font></b><span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">The latest Netrokona bomb massacre and 
  killing of dozen of dedicated progressive boys and girls once again showed how 
  well knit is the Islamic network and its tentacles spreading all over BD now. 
  They can hit any place any time with out care of government’s security 
  arrangement infested with RAB or Police top guys. How clever are theses 
  people. This time they have discovered a ‘Hindu boy’ named Yadab a suicidal 
  bomb. The mechanism is obvious – to divert the responsibility from Islamite 
  militant organizations like JMB or JMJB to Indian Raw agent(s). The government 
  and its militant organizers are out to shrug of the offence to India from the 
  shoulder of the Islamic fundamentalist. Mr. Babar, our most talkative deputy 
  home minister already commented after he came over to Netrokona in a 
  helicopter that ‘the involvement of a Hindu suicidal bomb Yadab has added a 
  new dimension to our clumsy situation. “We have to think afresh, yes afresh. 
  We though that work was of JMB, now we have to think differently.” This 
  attempt to bring in Indian involvement has been fanned by a section of the 
  government as you might remember that our BDR chief a few months back while 
  attending a conference at Delhi said in a foolish manner breaking all 
  diplomatic decency that India were involved in recent bomb explosions because 
  an Indian trespasser was arrested at Satkhira with some explosive devices (?). 
  When the Indian HC at Dhaka demanded to interview the person, and the 
  documents of proving his nationality, the government or the BDR chef kept mum. 
  Under the pressure of the Islamic Moulanas led by Khatib of Baitul Mukarram, 
  and Jamat leaders the time old theory of Indian conspiracy was brought back 
  creating a Hindu suicidal bomb in Yadab. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">But the BD people are not that fools. The 
  AL secretary general Mr. Jalil has already blasted the story of Ydav. Do you 
  remember story of ‘Partha’, a innocent bright young man- how he was tortured, 
  persecuted by the Nizami-Khaleda communal government to implicate India 
  connection with 21 August grenade incident at AL meeting. The government has 
  destroyed this young talented computer scientist who had come back to Dhaka to 
  serve his motherland after completing higher studies from India. I am afraid 
  young Yadav and his family awaits similar fate. Nothing we can do about it. 
  Already his brother Vikram has been rounded up with other seven for 
  interrogation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">Netrokona is a small district, once under 
  the greater Mymensigh. Early in the morning 9-30 a.m. to be exact, the 
  enthusiastic workers of Netrokona branch Udichi started assembling near the 
  place where Udichi’s annual function were to start at 10 a.m. Many of their 
  central committee members were also expected to come from Dhaka. It was learnt 
  that a small packet was found laying the place of the dais. When attention was 
  drawn to the attending security personnel, they identified to be an explosive 
  device, and took immediate steps to detonate it. As reported hearing the sound 
  of the blast in the process, a young man wrapped with some wires etc came 
  forward.&nbsp; The human bomb blasted killing at least seven people and as many as 
  39 injured with bomb splinters. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
  <span style="font-family: Verdana">The killed and wounded persons were taken 
  to Netrokona Hospital and private hospitals &amp; clinics. Later on serious ones 
  were transferred to Mymensigh district hospital and Medical College Hospital. 
  Whether Yadab is really the human bomb or he is like many an onlookers remains 
  to be seen- and the real human bomb or bomb thrower successfully had 
  camouflaged the entire incident. A cleaver and well thought out plan indeed.

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">As usual our PM reacted 
  immediately and switched on her old recorder player, which says, “I am deeply 
  shocked. Everything will be done to find out the culprits. They are the 
  enemies of the country, and out defame our image.” She instructed for proper 
  treatment of the injured. Her deputy minister in charge of interior affairs, 
  Mr. Babar in his characteristic Anglo Bengali dialect said after arrival at 
  Netrokona, “Atamahanan boma halo ekti ‘Global issue’, Kebal Bnagladeshei 
  hochhena, <i>happening in</i> nana jaigai. Amara <i>try</i> karchhi to arrest 
  oder, mane <i>others</i> . Aage we thought ‘JMB-der kaj, kintu now – Hindu 
  found, Amader natun kore <i>think</i>&nbsp; chinta korte hobe.” “<i>It is a 
  challenge for</i> Amader janya. Amader abashya <i>try</i> kore jete habe.” 
  Dear reader can you make head and tail of the utterances of our minister. 
  Don’t blame Mr. Babar, -&nbsp; he is a typical representative of Council of 
  ministers of Begum Khaleda Zia Rahman, our all knowing PM. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">The reporters from all electronic 
  channel reported that town of Netrokona looks deserted- every one now interned 
  in fear and anger. All shops, entertaining centres, like clubs, cinema halls 
  closed down. The RAB and Police are the only living beings in human form found 
  in the town, even the street dogs took shelter inside houses. </font></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">From the students, at DU campus 
  the recently formed Sangarm Parisad of seven students’ organizations brought 
  out processions and held rallies blaming the 4-part alliance government’s for 
  Netrokona killing of Udichi workers and innocent people. The rally demanded 
  resignation of the government. On the other hand leaders of the BNP student 
  front blamed AL for all recent bomb killings including the incident of 
  Jhalkathi, Gazipur and now of Netrokona. We do not blame the BNP student front 
  because they have no independent existence- so they have to echo their 
  chairperson’s voice full throated. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">All political parties opposition 
  to government brought processions, protest rallies, held meetings condemning 
  government’s utter failure to protect lives of innocent people. Dhaka Udichi 
  brought out a big procession condemning atrocious and repeated attack upon on 
  them. They clearly blamed the Police and RAB for manufacturing ‘Yadab story’ 
  in an attempt to shift the blame from the militant Islamic fundamentalist to a 
  communal channel. The leaders opined expressively that all bomb attacks have 
  been and are being carried out by Jamat and other Islamic parties with a view 
  to establish a Islamic system in Bangladesh. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana">The AL general secretary and other 
  AL leaders in a meeting held in front of their party office at Bangabandhu 
  Avenue, blamed the government for bomb attacks on judges, officials, secular 
  peoples and cultural organizations are the work of Islamic fundamentalists 
  sitting with the government. The Yadav story, a creation of the police at the 
  instance of Jamatis, is to camouflage the real issue. The meeting claimed the 
  government failure and demanded resignation of the government. </font></p>
