  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><b><span style="background-color: #99FF99">ASI
  Report Delights Rama-Worshipers but would it solve the problem ?</span></b><O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Archeological Survey of India submitted (ASI) on Friday,
  22<sup>nd</sup> August to the Allahabad High Court its report of result of its
  excavation just beneath the land where Babri Masjid stood before it was
  demolished by Hindu fundamentalists in 1992. A 574-page report, as circulated
  by the High Court in question to the interested parties involved in the
  contest attracted sharp reaction from both contestants, the Rama-Bhaktas
  determined to build a new Rama temple on the site on one hand and opposing
  them are equally determined Muslim clergies supported by Muslim mass. The main
  issue of the contest between the saffron brigade of Viswa Hindu Parishad and
  other Hindu organizations keen to build a temple dedicated to Lord Rama, the
  mythical king of Ayodhya, and 6<sup>th</sup> incarnation of God Vishnu in
  Treta Yuga and Indian Muslims whose sentiments were severely hurt when the
  historic Babri Mosque was demolished by a fanatical Hindu group is who are the
  owner of the land. Before we analyze the very delicate issue, let us what the
  findings of the archeological findings below the disputed site. The report is
  said to include- written opinions, maps and drawings and list archeological
  valuable materials of historical importance. If we leave aside the debatable
  politico-religious issue, the excavation work itself of very academic values
  to the historians, art historian and archeologists of the transition period
  when Hindu power had already dwindled giving place to new Muslim powers, the
  Sultans followed by invasion of Babur, the founder of Mughal emperor.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><b><span style="background-color: #99FF99">Findings
  of Ayodhya digging</span></b></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Summary of the main findings may be stated as follows:<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal">There is 'archeological evidence of a massive
      structure' below ground where the Babri mosque was destroyed in 1992.
    <li class="MsoNormal">The structure bears distinctive features associated
      with ancient temples of northern India.
    <li class="MsoNormal">There is evidence of building work there from as far
      as the 10<sup>th</sup> century.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The excavated area covered beneath the disputed land at
  least 14,000 sq.ft over which the report said, 'There is sufficient proof of
  existence of a massive and monumental structure having a minimum dimension of
  50x30 meters in the north-south and east-west directions, respectively, just
  below the disputed structure.' The report said that excavation clearly showed
  distinctive features of a tenth century temple below the ruins of the Babri
  Mosque. It further mentions discovery of 50 pillar bases, decorated bricks
  bearing features of 10<sup>th</sup> century, deities of Hindu gods and
  goddesses, lotus motifs, and curved architectural pieces. The report, on the
  basis of these archeological findings came to the conclusion of existence of a
  Hindu temple at the site of dispute. The pillar bases exposed in the northern
  and southern gave some idea of the length of the massive wall of the earlier
  construction with which they were associated and might have been originally 60
  m. Toward the east of the central point, a circular depression was noted
  signifying some important object was placed there. In the report it is stated
  that the main chamber of the disputed structure falls just over the central
  point of the length of the massive wall of the preceding period which could
  not be excavated because of the presence of the idol of the infant Rama in the
  makeshift structure. The salient and significant conclusion of the excavation
  seem to be that area below the disputed site remained a place for public use
  till the Mughal period when the disputed structure was built (Babri Mosque)
  which was confined to a limited area and the population settled around it as
  evidenced by the increase in contemporary archeological materials. This
  conclusion, the report said, is further attested by the conspicuous absence of
  habitational structure such as house complexes, soakage pits, and jars, ring
  wells, drains, hearths, kilns or furnaces.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="background-color: #99FF99">Will the
  archeological evidence settle the issue ?</span></b><O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The report was opened before the Lucknow bench of the
  Allahabad high court on 25<sup>th</sup> August morning. This is a unique
  occasion where academicians have been brought to the High court dock to help
  settle a very volatile, touchy and politico-religious problem. The High Court
  itself would be obviously be in a dilemma to what extent the findings would or
  should influence the verdict. It may be recalled that in 1993, the Indian
  Supreme Court held the opinion that 'it was not its job to decide if a temple
  existed at the site where the Babri Mosque stood before 1992.' It further went
  on saying 'it was not its job to decide if, as Hindus claim, their god Lord
  Rama was born there.' It is really a most complicated real estate dispute i.e.
  who the land legally belongs to - Hindus or contesting Muslims, not whether
  Lord Rama was born there or there was a <i>Rama-mandir</i> beneath the
  depleted Babri Mosque of initial Mughal period.<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Another question popped up after the Allahabad High court
  ordered the archeological department of government of India to undertake a
  thorough excavation work at the site below the destroyed mosque to find
  whether a Hindu temple once stood on the spot where the Babri mosque was
  constructed later when to stop excavation. The Hindus of Ayodhya all along
  have been contesting the Babri Mosque was built by the invading Muslims over
  the site of the old Hindu temple. The historian BB Lal opined that the ruins
  of a temple dedicated to Lord Tama exists underneath the spot where Babri
  mosque once stood. He further contented that when the Babri mosque was
  demolished an inscription was unearthed that states, 'a temple was constructed
  by a King Nayachandra in the 12<sup>th</sup> century to honour Ram.'</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Regarding the question of how far below the excavation go
  on, historian Lal was of the opinion that it should stop its digging process
  as son as clear evidence is found to prove that a Hindu temple existed on the
  disputed spot when he says, 'As the court had only decreed that it be found if
  a temple existed on the spot, it would make sense to stop digging when
  evidence of a temple is found.'<span> </span>Many however opine that once
  excavation has started it must go on continuing for search for ruins for ruins
  of later earlier periods if the site is of extreme archeological importance.
  Already Jain representatives that Jain temples existed on the site, which
  should be restored to them once found. They also demanded to an observer to
  monitor the excavation that was however turned down by ASI. Apparently it
  seemed that excavation has come to an end.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <h1><font size="4"><span style="background-color: #99FF99">Muslim reaction:
  Ram-mandir is really a Hindu-Muslim Dispute</span></font></h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>Sangh and other orthodox Hindu organizations bent
  to build a Ram-mandir, have enough reasons to exhibit pleasure. The Muslim
  reaction, as expected is not very pleasant. The militant Hindus now demanding
  that Muslims voluntarily gave up their right over the disputed land. The BJP
  asked Muslim organizations to 'rethink on their rigid stand' on Ayodhya. <O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>Ms Ranjana Agnihotra, counsel of the Nirmohi
  Akhra, has said to have commented, according to AFP news agency that ASI
  report 'describes a 10<sup>th</sup> or 11<sup>th</sup> century structure that
  indicates a temple existed in the excavated site.' The councilor P L Mishra of
  Hindu Mahasabha said, 'Now the that the ASI report has unearthed remnants of
  such a temple during the digging of the disputed site, there is no need for
  further evidence.' <O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>As usual Muslim community leaders 'rejected' the
  report saying it as a 'concoction' of the ASI to please its 'political masters'.
  The All India Muslim Personal Law Board today (25<sup>th</sup> August)
  alleged, according to Daily Telegraph report, that ASI findings were 'without
  any basis' and have been 'concocted' at the instance of the Atal Bihari
  Vajpayee government. The board secretary Mohammed Abdur Rahim Quraishi said in
  statement, 'This report is totally inconsistent with the interim report
  submitted earlier.'<O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>These harsh, unkind and unpleasant comment aimed
  at the ASI, a very reputed institution and the excavating team of experts who
  after toil of months unearthed ruins of archeological materials that clearly
  indicated presence of a Hindu temple prior to Babri mosque. The finding must
  be taken as its face value without implying political-religious motive to the
  excavating team. Let the high court decide to what extent findings would help
  it come to a just, legal and human conclusion. <O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>The Sunni Central Waqf Board, one of the
  litigants in the dispute, said it was 'vague and self contradictory'. They
  accused ASI report of ignoring the discovery of glazed tiles and pottery
  indicative of Muslim settlements in the area before Babar's invasion. It is
  very likely, but that does not disprove the existence of vast structure
  indicative of a Hindu temple prior to Babri mosque on the same site. Advocate
  Zafaryab Jillani, counsel for the board said that the Waqf board would produce
  'irrefutable ' historical and archeological evidence to challenge the
  findings. Jillani told the BBC as saying, the ASI has 'misinterpreted the
  findings'. <O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>The ASI kept their neutrality by declining to
  make any comments on the team's findings and left the matter to the High
  court. The Muslim contestants do not deny the authenticity of the discovery of
  archeological materials but only differ in interpretation and refused to take
  evidence as conclusive evidence that the temple was a Hindu temple. <O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>Rama-temple issue in Uttar Pradesh not only
  involve religious issues. Many issues are interlinked with it making the
  problem a very complicate one. In my next episode I will bring in those issues
  that are stake threatening India's liberal secular democracy for which each
  Indian should take pride and the 'ideal of pluralism' the basis of which is 'Unity
  in diversity.'&nbsp;</span>
