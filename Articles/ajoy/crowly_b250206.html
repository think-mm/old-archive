	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">US Congressman Joseph Crowley, 
	co-chairman of US Congress Bangladesh Caucus, held a press conference in the 
	afternoon today, 22nd February 2006 after having a series of talks with the 
	AL Chief and leader of the opposition Sheikh Hasina and Prime Minister Begum 
	Khaleda Zia Rahman. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a press conference he said that 
	for fair and free election a device must be found through a mutual 
	understanding between the government parties and the opposition parties. He 
	however opined that the government has a more responsibility in holding free 
	and fair election. He pointed out that every citizen above 18 years must 
	found his name in the voter list. He expressed hopes that 4 party alliance 
	government would respond positively to the election reform proposals placed 
	before the parliament by the main opposition and settle the issue to 
	facilitate credible elections. “I know that the minority (the main 
	opposition) have made their case or (are) attempting to make their case in 
	parliament and I hope that response from the majority (the government) will 
	be done in way to settle the issue.”, he told the press conference held in 
	the American Centre. He further expressed his pious wish by saying that like 
	him the US wants to see a free and transparent elections, where all eligible 
	voters would caste their votes without hindrance and fear. Praising high of 
	practice of democracy in Bangladesh, the congressman observed, “We in United 
	States respect Bangladesh for democracy. We want democracy here continues to 
	develop and flourish. It is important to have free, fair elections for 
	flourishing Bangladesh’s democracy.” He expressed his satisfaction to see 
	what he called Bangladeshi democracy “a moderate Islamic democracy.” </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Crowley returns home today 
	morning (24th February) after a 3-day visit to Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the morning the congressman met 
	Sheikh Hasina and her party colleagues in Sudhabhaban, the residence of AL 
	chief. The AL chief reiterated the proposals for independent election 
	commission and a truly neutral caretaker government under which a fair 
	election might be possible. The proposals reflect the no confidence of AL 
	over the present election commission now headed by a justice of the Supreme 
	Court, who it is alleged that he was a beneficiary of BNP and the present 
	mechanism of formation of a caretaker government. Mr. Crowley gave a patient 
	hearing but, it is learnt did not make any comment. How USA can help in 
	holding a fare election in BD to this question AL chief sought the 
	cooperation of the USA government in this matter. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the meeting Mr. Jalil, the GS 
	of AL told the journalists that he has been apprised of the need of a free 
	and fare election under an independent election commission and a neutral 
	caretaker government formed according to the AL formula. Mr. Crowley however 
	evaded questions asked by the present journalists saying that he would 
	address the press in the afternoon. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the meeting with PM Begum 
	Khaleda informed Mr. Crowley that her government is treating members of 
	minority communities equally. In fact there is no discrimination between 
	majority and minority- they are all Bangladeshis. Her government is taking 
	every measure to protect the rights of every citizen including those 
	belonging to minority communities for which the congressman thanked her and 
	her government. He termed these steps as “some positive steps”- what are 
	those positive steps – the congressman did not elaborate, nor the minorities 
	knew about those steps. It is not a new thing what Khaleda said- nor she 
	individually nor her government has ever admitted that minorities are being 
	persecuted by her government, her political followers and Islamic 
	fundamentalists. Leaving aside every thing, when our constitution begins 
	with ‘Bismillah ar Rahman ar Rahim’, when our constitution says, ‘Absolute 
	trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all 
	actions’(81A), when our constitution pledges, ‘The state religion of the 
	Republic is Islam, but other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony 
	‘(2A), when our constitution pledges ‘the high ideals of absolute trust in 
	Almighty Allah’ (Preamble) then how could PM Khaleda and her associates in 
	BNP or 4-party alliance could claim that minorities have equal rights and 
	are treated equal according to constitution and law of the country? Mr. 
	Crowley knows it very well; even then he praised her government. Is it just 
	a diplomatic norm, or does he sincerely believe that Khaleda government is 
	taking measures to protect the rights of minorities? It is the US government 
	that has put a stigma ‘Bangladesh is a moderate Moslem state’ on the 
	forehead of Bangladesh, and Mr. Crowley knows it very well. Now he has 
	issued a new certificate calling Bangladeshi democracy as “a moderate 
	Islamic democracy”. Would Mr. Crowley explain to us what is the definition 
	of “Islamic democracy” with a prefix “moderate”? We were already tired of 
	hearing moderate Moslem state or moderate Moslem democracy. Then what is the 
	meaning of ‘People’s Republic of Bangladesh’ – that the constitution defined 
	the character of Bangladesh ? </font></p>
