  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">A
  month back Dr. B. Choudhury, darling secretary general of Bangladesh National
  Party (Bangladesh Jatiyatabadi Dal) of General Ziaur Rahman during the
  formative period of BNP declared after a period of hibernation that he would
  float a new political party, an alternative to both party in power and party
  in opposition. It soon became a talk of the town and very rapidly a term was
  coined ‘<i>Bikalpa dharar rajniti</i>’ meaning Alternative path of
  Politics. The darling of both General Zia and of Begum Zia until all on a
  sudden he fell out grace of the great lady and kicked out of the presidency
  and the Bangavaban now testing the fruits of the baby tree of terrorism
  General Zia and B. Choudhury reaped in late seventy’s. The baby tree is no
  more a baby now; it has now taken the shape of a banyan tree with its
  innumerable roots penetrating socio- political and cultural soil of
  Bangladesh. Remember Niru-Bablu-Avi, the product of Hizbul Bahar phenomenon,
  groomed as budding terrorists equipped with modern arms only to be found in
  cantonment and trained as bomb and explosive device makers. Hundred and
  thousands of young and talented were recruited. The germination of terrorism
  in new phase was born in DU campus, which soon spread to all educational
  institutions, and in public. Weapons and arms became the language of
  students’ politics. Banned were the decency, sense of refine-ness,
  politeness, respect from our students’ political culture and vocabulry, and
  since then we may say from politics of students ‘<i>Subacjan Nirvasane</i>’
  (the sweet wards are banished). BNP terrorism is now a monster just like the
  mythical Frankenstein.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Dr.
  Choudhury asked for a permission to hold a convention in paltan maidan, which
  was denied to him. Then he decided to hold his convention in Muktangan on 11<sup>th</sup>
  March where he was supposed to declare his party and his party’s programme.
  ‘We took prior permission for holding the meeting at the Muktangan with
  public address system from the city mayor’s office’, claimed one organizer
  of ‘Alternative Politics’. The meeting was scheduled to be held at around
  4 p.m. On the previous night when decorators went to construct the dais and
  set up public address system, they were driven out of the premise by a group
  of young men, alleged to have sympathy with BNP. The message was loud and
  clear what was to be expected next day ‘a reign of terror’.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">On
  the day of March 11, B. Choudhury, Major Dr. Abdul Mannan and Mr. Mahi
  Choudhury, both resigned from Parliament as MP couple of days back with their
  supporters not less than two hundreds started with procession from KC Memorial
  clinic, Baridhara, temporary office of the Bikalpa forum on way to Muktangan,
  Purana paltan at about 2-30 p.m. The procession was proceeding with 15 cars
  and microbuses. On their way at several points they were intercepted by the
  police and hundreds of youths equipped with rods etc hurled on them at every
  point of interception. The youths led an organized assault on Dr. Choudhury
  himself, Major Mannan and Mr. Mahi Choudhury when they left the cars and
  proceeded on foot. The goondas let loose by our madam PM started throwing
  brickbats, beating with rods and sticks etc. At one stage a motorbike
  attempted to run over Dr. Choudhury and his son. Luckily supporters of Dr.
  Choudhury managed to protect them. Hundreds of processionists were wounded
  including Major Mannan. When the assault was taking place, the police acted as
  mere on lookers. The object of the militant BNP supporters was achieved as
  they could successfully drove back and scatter out the mass intending to
  attend the meeting. Prof. Choudhury was taken back to KC memorial clinic in a
  microbus of Channel-I from the Khilgaon rail gate, where he was surrounded by
  the BNP terrorists shouting obscene slogans like ‘<i>Badruddozar chamara,
  tule nebo amra</i>’, a fine exposition of respect and modesty to their
  party’s founder president and their nominated Country’s President. The
  supporters also cold successfully escort out Mahi and Mannan out of the furry
  of BNP mastans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The
  police first intercepted Choudhury’s procession of cars at Nutan Bazar. They
  diverted it towards Asian Highway Rail crossing near Kuril, where once again
  police stopped the motorcades by bringing down the railway barricade saying
  that a train was coming. As a traffic jam was created the processionists got
  out of the cars and held an unscheduled rally there. Professor Choudhury in
  his address declared, “Our procession is being intercepted in an
  undemocratic way. This revealed the autocratic nature of the government, and
  hence it has no legal basis to stay in power. “ When being asked, a police
  officer on the spot expressed ‘We have nothing to do, whatever we are doing
  at the instance from the top (<i>oporwala</i>). At this stage, they started
  walking in procession leaving the automobiles. The police again stopped the
  procession at the staff railway crossing. At this stage two supporters carried
  Choudhury and Mannan on motorbike covering long 6 km distance reaching
  Mhakhali railway crossing where once again they were intercepted by the police
  on the plea that no procession is allowed to pass through VIP road advising
  them to follow the path through Tejgaon industrial area. They decided to hold
  the assembly and rally there. Prof. Choudhury said in his address, “The
  government’s behavior is cruel and detestable and extremely beastly. This
  government has no right to stay in power.” As Major Mannan took the
  microphone and started addressing the assembly, a gang of terrorists and
  goondas armed with rods and sticks hurled on the assembly with motorbikes and
  started throwing brickbats. Major Mannan got injured with a brickbat. The
  assembly immediately got scattered as a few rounds of bullet-firing were
  heard. Major Mannan was carried to elsewhere with a police van. A motorbike
  attacked Mahi Choudhury as it wanted to run over him. Some supporters removed
  him from the spot to a safer place. On the other hand Dr. Choudhury, being
  wounded by a stone throw ran along the railway track for safety and sat over
  there tired. He was kept surrounded by large number supporters forming a
  protecting human barricade. The goondas continued to hurl on stones and
  brickbats. At this stage he was rescued by one or two police officer and
  driven to KC Memorial Clinic. In this way came the end of rally of B.
  Choudhury. B. Choudhury must have been thinking ‘are they my boys’ and
  remembering the story of Frankenstein. But Badu Choudhury, as he is
  satirically called by his critics may draw some solace that this time ‘it is
  me, but who knows it would be you, all powerful lady the next target of the
  Frankenstein !</p>

  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Simultaneously
  at Muktangan another drama was taking place. The heroes were the golden boys
  of our madam PM. Her golden boys took the possession of the premises of
  Muktangan under the banner of “Welfare Association of the Homeless” (<i>Bastuhara
  Klyan Samiti</i>), an organization formed overnight to spoil the meeting of B.
  Choudhury. They openly used filthy language against their erstwhile leader Dr.
  B. Choudhury and his supporters. The intercepted any groups or processions
  coming to attend the rally of Dr. Choudhury. Some were severely beaten, even
  veteran journalist Ataus Samad, a pro BNP intellectual was maltreated when he
  asked the occupier of the premises thinking them as the organizers of B.
  Choudhury’s meeting about B. Choudhury’s whereabouts. A procession of
  layers was beaten back and manhandled by the golden pieces of Madame Zia. A
  day before, the great lady declared that ‘<i>Ora Bikalpa Shakati noy,
  BNP’r kono bikalpa nai, ora Bikal Sjhakti</i>’ (they are not alternative
  force, there is no alternative to BNP; they are crippled force). The golden
  boys of the BNP got the message, and materialized their Madam’s words to
  reality. They really made B. Choudhury ineffective by shear brutal force with
  the aid of our dear police force whose duty were to protect the mild and not
  the notorious, but they changed their role at the instruction of the <i>oporwalas</i>.</p>
