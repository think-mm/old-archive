	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">Almost 29 
	years ago 4 prominent national leaders who led our war of liberation to 
	success during those critical days following the horrible night of 25<sup>th</sup> 
	March 1971 were simply killed in cold blood by a gang of murderers in 
	uniform. These leaders were Sayed Nazrul Islam, Vice President of war time 
	cabinet of Mujibnagar government, Tajuddin Ahmed, Prime Minister, Capt. 
	Mansur Ali, Finance Minister and AHM Quamruzzama, Minister of Interior 
	affairs, relief and rehabilitation. The incident took place between 3-4 a.m. 
	November 3, 1975. As the evidence revealed in those critical days between 
	3-7<sup>th</sup> November, Mustaq Ahmed, the then so called puppet president 
	installed by the killers of Bangabandhu, personally directed his 3-4 men led 
	to kill those national leaders and gallant freedom fighters in the central 
	jail. The order was executed with hundred percent precision of success by a 
	team of army personnel led by Capt. Moslem. The jail authority in spite of 
	its best intention failed to protect the nation leaders against. At that 
	time, at the jail office present were Jailor Mr. Aminur Rahman, DIG prison 
	Mr. Khandkar Abdul Awal&nbsp; and IG prison Md. Nuruzzaman etc. They were simply 
	bewildered, panicked and at a loss what to do at the gunpoint of the 
	intruders in uniform.&nbsp; At gunpoint they were taken to the ward where 4 
	leaders were housed. As we know now, the leaders were forcibly isolated from 
	others and taken inside a separated small room, and killers immediately 
	opened brush fire again and again all around till total silence prevailed. 
	The killers then left the place. The death occurred between 4 and 4-30 a.m. 
	Some time after, around 5-30 a.m. morning another killer team led by nayek 
	A. Ali came inside the jail to make sure that operation was successfully 
	carried out. They straight went to the ward and bayonet charged dead bodies 
	to confirm the death. The team left thereafter. </span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The dead 
	bodies lied scattered inside the room till dead bodies of Shahid Tajuddin 
	Ahmed and Syed Nazrul Islam were handed over to their relatives at the jail 
	gate at11 p.m. night of November 4, 1975 and bodies of Qamruzzaman and Capt. 
	Mansur Ali were handed over to their relatives on the early morning of the 
	following day (November 5, 1975). </span></p>

	was a clear indication of Governments lenient view government has shown 
	towards this gentleman, and courts soft attitude towards 4 anti AL and pro 
	BNP politicians when the court admitted bails to them. Even a child could 
	assume that what would be the fate of the trial. The fate of the trial was a 
	foregone conclusion, and the court rightly read the mind of the government 
	what it wants. And the learned judge obligingly did it. This is the

	release of their men and save the lives of killers now absconding. Even the

	<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">In the 374-page judgment the 
	learned judge made some comments saying that this killing is a national 
	disgrace. He lamented that it is an irony of fate that these 4 leaders who 
	put their lives at stake for our independence were killed by a group of 
	people. The judge accused the investigating officer for poorly making the 
	case, which has damaged the merit of the case. His comments in favour of 
	some released persons are very curious which reflects his sympathy for those 
	persons. He blamed the investigation officer for listing their names without 
	valid ground. May we ask the learned judge whatever may be the fault of 
	methodology the fact is the real lanners, the brain of the project 
	successfully evaded the long hand of law. This is the failure of our 
	judicial system. Mr. Rahman, you were very harsh and critical of the 
	procedure of investigation and at one stage you mentioned that it was not at 
	all an investigation, and was politically motivated. If you felt so strongly 
	why did you proceed further of the trial for 227 working days; you could 
	have stopped the trial in the interest of fair trail and ordered for 
	reinvestigation. But you didnt instead you took the advantage of the flaw 
	(?) of investigation to release of the men of your likings. Is this a fair 
	trail, learned judge? </span></p>
