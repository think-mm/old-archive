  <p align="center"><strong><font color="#800000" size="4">By Ajoy Roy</font></strong></p>
  </i>
  <p><font size="3">Shahriar Kabir, a reputed freelance journalist in
  Bangladesh, a documentary filmmaker, a writer, a humanist, and above all- an
  uncompromising human rights activist, was born in a typical middle class
  Bangladesh family on 20<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>November 1950.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Mr. Kabir after completing his schooling in 1968 with Higher
  Secondary Certificate in 1968 and formal education in 1971 Mr. Kabir began his
  journalist career. As a freedom fighter he participated in our liberation-war
  against the Pakistani occupation force in 1971. After liberation of Bangladesh
  from Pakistani occupation force Shahriar joined ‘Vichitra’ group- a left
  leaning Marxism based liberal group formed centering a popular Weekly Magazine
  called ‘Vichitra’ in 1972. There he served as a member of the editorial
  board ending with Executive Editor in 1992. He was a regular contributor not
  only of his own Magazine of all important dailies and earned reputation as an
  analytical and critical columnist. His critical articles created a host
  friends amongst the humanist liberal and secular circles but equal number of
  enemies in the establishment as well as among the fundamentalists and
  communalists.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <b><u>
  <p><span style="background-color: #CCFFFF"><font size="4" color="#000080">1.
  Shahriar Championing the cause of Trial of War criminals</font></span></p>
  </u></b>
  <p><font size="2">As Shahriar was exposing himself as an humanist and activist
  against human rights violation through his writings exposing the ugly desire
  and design of seizing power by fundamentalist forces to turn secular-liberal
  democratic Bangladesh into a theocratic state based on fundamental Islamic
  principles he became one of the principal target of the Islamite force in
  Bangladesh. Shahriar equally invited animosity of the fundamentalists and
  political elites who believes in autocratic form of governing system based on
  Islamic principles and pseudo-democracy. His writings and activities exposing
  the role of fundamentalists led by Jamat e Islami invited added displeasure of
  the Islamic force who declared him ‘Murtad’, a term meaning a Muslim who
  has severed his relation from Islam, a term very much despised by an ordinary
  Muslim. Since the liberation of our country we have been demanding a trial of
  the Bangladeshi war criminals like Golum Azam, Amir of Jamat e Islami, who
  collaborated with the Pakistani occupation force against our war of
  liberation. Shahriar’s voice was loud and clear- he took an active part with
  many of the distinguished members of the civil society under the leadership
  Mrs. Jahanara Imam, mother of a guerilla fighter- a Martyr in our war of
  liberation in the formulation of Public Tribunal which held open trial against
  these collaborators. The tribunal found many of the accused collaborators
  including Mr. Golum Azam, Amir of Jamat e Islami in Bangladesh was found
  guilty. The tribunal asked the then sitting government of Bangladesh National
  Party (BNP) (1992-96) led by Mrs. Khaleda Rahman, preferred to be known as
  Khaleda Zia, wife of late president General Zia ur Rahman,</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">This action of trying the accused collaborators in a public
  tribunal by passing the government system of judiciary antagonized the
  government of Khaleda Begum. This is because the party in power BNP since its
  formation in early eighties by late Zia ur Rahman, an army general of
  Bangladesh army, and sector commander in our liberation war in 1972 was
  harbouring good relations with the Islamic parties including the Jamaat e
  Islami. In fact General Zia after assuming power rehabilitated the
  fundamentalists in the body politic of Bangladesh. Golum Azam was brought back
  by his initiative, and later on the government of Khaleda Begum did everything
  to return citizenship to Mr. Azam. It was therefore no wonder that public
  trial of Mr. Azam was taken seriously by the Khaleda government, which was at
  that time trying to protect the interest of the Jamat chief. All elite of the
  society involved in the proceedings of the trial including Mr. Shahriar Kabir
  were arrested by Khaleda government in nineties with sedition charge- all of
  them were termed as anti-state elements. Al though these elite citizens were
  harassed in public but were not put behind the bar as the learned high court
  granted bails to them. The case was finally dropped after a couple of years
  when a new caretaker government came to power under a retired chief justice
  replacing the BNP government which was forced to resign because of mass
  uprising against it.</font></p>

  Shahriar Kabir - a humanist, championing the cause of minorities in Bangladesh</span></font></p>
  </u></b>
  <p><font size="2">The minorities, ethnic, religious or cultural, wherever they
  are in a country are deprived of equal privileges, rights and opportunities.
  They are usually denied of sharing power and privileges in the state
  functions. They cannot play their due role in the development process of a
  country. They develop a sense of non-belongingness to his own country,
  ultimately they tend to form an isolated group cutting off from the main
  stream of the nation. They ultimately become foreigners in their motherland.
  The general feeling of the majority community is of antipathy or they develop
  a sense of inertness towards their minority neighbours. In the extreme case
  the majority community do have a sense of over satisfaction that in their
  country ‘minorities are much better off’ compared to the plights of
  minorities in other countries. They cannot appreciate the problems of the
  members of the minority communities. This picture is more or less true even in
  a country having secular and liberal democratic set up. The condition and
  plight of minorities are all the more worse in those countries where
  no-democracy or pseudo democracy operates- as in Bangladesh or Pakistan. In
  present day Pakistan the democracy is a far cry; since its inception Pakistan
  is officially an Islamic Republic, meaning it is a country to be governed by
  Islamic laws and principles. Pakistan has been all along under military
  dictatorship. Bangladesh is no exception. Although Bangladesh was born
  fighting against military junta and autocracy, the irony of the fate is that
  in her existence of 32 years at least 16 years we were under direct military
  rule and barring 7 years we were ruled either by military controlled or pseudo
  democracy. The present government, which came to power with full blessings of
  the military elite, is in fact a shadow military government.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">In this set up of governance of Bangladesh where judiciary
  is under the direct influence or control of the executive, the plight of
  minorities- religious or ethnic bound to be far from satisfactory. The
  situation gets worse when some communal trouble flare up in neighboring India.
  Citation of one or two examples as given below, are suffice to make the point
  clear.</font></p>
  <b><u><font color="#ff0000">
  <ul>
    <li>Babri Masjid Incident in India &amp; its Fall out In Bangladesh</li>
  </ul>
  </font></u></b>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Following the Babri Mosque incidents and finally its
    destruction in 1992, a series of retaliatory incidents of minority
    repressions (1989-92) befell on them; these include killing, looting, raping
    of women, destruction or molestation of temples &amp; place of worships and
    forceful eviction of thousands of families. <strong><font color="#0000ff">As
    a result of these oppressive measures coupled with prevailing discriminatory
    Acts and purposeful discriminatory actions on the part of the government(s)
    in the matter employment from among the members of the minority communities
    in the government and non-government services including defence, and
    meaningful changes brought in Bangladesh Constitution affecting its secular
    character, a large number minorities specially Hindus were forced to leave
    their motherland, Bangladesh.</font></strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><strong>In respect of discrimination in
    employment let me give a list of observation made by Special Rapporteur, Mr.
    Abdel Fattah Armor of ‘Commission on Human Rights for Religious
    Intolerance and Discrimination’ who visited Bangladesh some time in May
    2000. He did note existing discrimination in regard to employment and
    religious intolerance against the minorities including Hindus, Christians,
    and Ahmedias. He had expressed his concern on these matters to the
    government. (UN document on elimination of all forms of religious
    intolerance, A/55/280/Add.)</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">According to the leaders of Hindu minority community the
    estimated damage following December 6, 1992 incident of Babri Masjid,
    inflicted on the minorities within a month or so:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">28,000 houses looted and destroyed,</font>
      <li><font size="2">3,600 temples &amp; places of worships including
        deities were destroyed,</font>
      <li><font size="2">2,800 business or professional establishments were
        destroyed</font>
      <li><font size="2">13 persons were killed and 1,925 received severe
        injuries.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">At least 2,600 women were raped and sexually abused.
    According to conservative estimate the extent of economic damage fell around
    1860 millions Bangladesh Taka i.e. roughly 37.20 million US dollars. But who
    could estimate the humiliation, dishonour and indignation they received and
    honour and dignity they lost in financial unit ?&nbsp;</font></p>

  <ul>
    <li>General Election of October and its fall out</font></u></li>
  </ul>
  </b>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">Immediately before and following the general election in
    Bangladesh held in October 2, 2001, an unprecedented reign of terror was let
    loose on the members of the minority communities, religious as well as
    ethnic, by the armed cadres of the victorious 4-party alliance. It exceeded
    all past records in dimension and intensity. The violence against the
    minorities, particularly directed against the Hindu minorities could be
    clearly characterized as follows:</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(a) <b>Killing</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(b) <b>Inhuman Physical torture</b> with unprecedented
    cruelty and method causing permanent damage on bodies. In these process,
    toothed sickle (scythe), heavy iron rod, cycle-chain, sharp knives, heavy
    and sharp choppers, axe, drilling machines, above all firearms and
    explosives etc.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(c) <b>Looting of property</b>, and forcible occupation of
    houses and landed properties or business establishments.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(d) <b>Destruction and setting fire on house</b>s, shops,
    business establishments irrespective of social status (no matter, if he is a
    poor villager, or a wealthy businessman in a city).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(e) <b>Extortion of money and Imposition subscription</b>
    on minority family in lieu of providing safety to the family and staying in
    Bangladesh.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(f) <b>Eviction from homes, and forcible migration</b> to
    neighbouring country or accept Islam in its lieu.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">(g) <b>Raping of wome</b>n, and various form of sexual
    violence, irrespective of age, marital status. Even girls of age 8-9 and
    pregnant women were not spared. And etc. and etc.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#008000" size="3">No organization, government or non
    government, even after two years made an estimate of loss of properties and
    other form of damages in fiscal units. It is a pity on the part of the
    Bangladesh Human Rights organizations.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">However an off hand study based on the published reports
    appeared in important dailies and data collected by human rights field
    workers of some voluntary organizations emerges out the following picture:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="3" color="#008000">Destruction of (and setting of fires)
        abodes, business centres etc. ~5,000,</font>
      <li><font size="3" color="#008000">Looting of cash money and extortion :
        60 millions Bangladesh Taka,</font>
      <li><font size="3" color="#008000">Killing : over hundreds</font>
      <li><font size="3" color="#008000">Severely injured leading to bodily
        disability : not less than 500,</font>
      <li><font size="3" color="#008000">Miscellaneous forms of injury: Over
        thousands,</font>
      <li><font size="3" color="#008000">Destruction of temples and places of
        worships : not less than 150,</font>
      <li><font size="3" color="#008000">Forcible eviction : not less than 5000
        families,</font>
      <li><font size="3" color="#008000">Raping and sexual violence : hundreds
        of women irrespective of age and marital status.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">On both occasions Shahriar’s voice of protest was heard
    clearly. He was a relentless fighter against any form of minority
    deprivation, discrimination and atrocities. During the fall out of ‘Babri
    Masjid demolition’ over the sky of Bangladesh Shahriar Kabir raised his
    protests through public meetings, holding rallies and through his writings.
    One of his writings written in Bengali, on the atrocities on minorities in
    Bangladesh following Babri Masjid incident, a well document description,
    attracted the attention and praise of many. The title of the book is &quot;Bangladeshe
    Sampradayikatar Chalchitra [Present State of Communalism in Bangladesh] -
    Shahriar Kabir, February, 1993 &quot;. Another documentation worth
    mentioning, by him is &quot;White Paper: Repression on Religious Minority,
    Dhaka, 1996.&quot;</font></p>

  Shahrirar faced sedition charge for championing the cause of Minorities</span></font></p>
  </u></b>
  <p align="justify"><font size="2">Shahriar became more active and courageous
  in defending and upholding the cause of minorities when the victorious armed
  cadres of the 4-party alliance were persecuting the minorities following
  October General election of 2001. He with his vigilance eye extensively toured
  various parts of the affected areas, collected data of minority repression for
  future documentation. Lakhs of Bangladeshi minorities crossed over to West
  Bengal to save their lives from the atrocious activities of the terrorists
  Shahriar went to West Bengal as a journalist to see for himself the plight of
  those unfortunate minorities taking shelter in the border areas of West
  Bengal. He collected information, took picture and made video films for future
  films on minority plight following general election in Bangladesh in 2001.
  Shahriar’s activities infuriated the government of Bangladesh. On his return
  from Calcutta he was arrested at the Dhaka airport on</font> <font size="2">22nd,</font><sup>
  </sup><font size="2">November, 2001.He was whistled away to a secret place by
  the special branch police (SBP) in a Gestapo style without allowing him to see
  his family members including his youngest son waiting at the airport to
  receive him. He was finally charged with sedition against his own country by
  supplying false documentation to outside world projecting it as a country of
  terrorism, intolerance and persecution against its own minority communities.
  In the meanwhile the enlightened citizens, the civil society, Mufassal (local)
  journalists, and many other human rights organizations and individuals by
  their extensive work and visit to the minority affected gradually brought to
  the surface the intensity and dimension of terrorism, atrocities, and
  perpetrations directed against the religious and ethnic minorities. The
  government replied with stern measures against these humanist groups in
  various methods and forms. These unpatriotic actions in the eye of the
  government, of humanists were tarnishing the image of the country in the
  outside world- the government alleged.</p>
  </font>
  <p><strong><font size="2" color="#008000">But government’s abortive

  imposed. Centering entrance of journalists of channel-4 of BBC, a great fuss
  was created by Bangladeshi government in December 2002. They were finally
  deported by the government. But legacy of so called ‘information
  terrorism’, a termed coined by Khaleda-Nizami government to indicate<strong><font color="#0000ff">
  </font></strong></font><strong><u><font size="2" color="#008000">free flow of
  information.</font></u></strong><font color="#000000" size="2"> This time many
  other journalists on sedition and other charges of anti state activities,
  political opponents and intellectuals known to be critics of the government
  were harassed in various ways. In fact, the government unleashed a reign of
  terror through its state machinery as well armed cadres of the coalition
  parties sharing state power.</p>
  <p>Once again Shahriar Kabir was arrested on 8 th&nbsp;December, 2002,from his
  residence in a predawn raid by the special branch police. During police remand
  and detention during remand/detention Shahriar was-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>denied division facilities though court orders repeatedly instructed the
      authorities to do so. The government very willfully violated court orders
      by shifting him to Chittagong jail where divisional facilities do not
      exist.
    <li>He was denied even basic physical facilities such as of food, proper
      toilet facilities, medical treatment and medicine, even drinking water. He
      was not even supplied with bed-sheets and blanket during terrible December
      winter days. He had to pass sleepless nights.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Shahriar is a typical case where government behaviour to its critics has
  been totally exposed. Its attitude is vindictive, revengeful and aimed to-
  ‘We would teach you a very good lesson for opposing us’.</p>
  <p>The government is found to carry on harassment in the following manner:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Court order regarding remand and division willfully flouted.
    <li>Transferring the detainee to remote jails of in remote corners of the
      country. Object of the government is not allowing him to consult his
      reputed lawyers in Dhaka and see his near &amp; dear ones.
    <li>Charge after charge being brought in in order to make High Court Order(s)
      of release ineffective if so facto.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All these actions of government are clearly indicative of harassment,
  vindictive and revengeful against Shahriar Kabir. But again our movement
  inside the country and international pressure and legal battle won
  Shahriar’s release on 7th January,2003.</p>
  </font>
  <p><strong><font size="2" color="#008000">Shahriar’s well articulated
  thoughts has been reflected in one of his articles presented at the
  ‘Conference on Human Rights in Bangladesh, held on 17 th August, 2002, at
  Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, just a few months before he was
  arrested by Bangladesh government second time. The title of his talk was
  &quot;<i>Human Rights in Bangladesh : Focus on Communal Persecution</i>.&quot;
  In this article he highlighted the happening of minority repression on
  unprecedented scale from October-December, 2001.</font></strong></p>
  <font color="#000000" size="2">
  <p>Let me quote from him &quot;<i>The religious minorities had been facing
  torture by Muslim religious fundamentalists and communal rightwing groups
  since the inception of Pakistan. Even during the parliamentary election of
  1996, one that brought the Awami League to power, various communal groups
  subjected them to intimidation but they kept silent possibly because the Awami
  League came to power.</p>
  <p>However, the torture and repression the Hindus faced surrounding the 2001
  elections were unprecedented in the country’s history. The Hindus were
  intimidated, their homes and businesses looted or burned, they were victims of
  extortion or rape -- just to ensure they stayed away from voting, and they
  left the area</i>.&quot; In spite of the facts that many human rights
  organizations and the civil society carried out some survey and reports
  appearing in national dailies, the real magnitude, extension and intensity of
  communal violence would probably never be revealed because of the following
  reasons, says Shahriar Kabir :</p>
  <p>1) Victims stayed away from registering complaints/cases with police
  fearing more repression as the attackers belonged to the ruling BNP-Jamaat
  coalition;</p>
  <p>2) It is impossible to get information on the incidents that took place in
  remote areas;</p>
  <p>3) Victims of rape rarely report it to the police not only fearing further
  torture, but also because of social conservativeness. In many countries of
  Asia including Bangladesh the rape victim is more ostracized by the society
  than the rapist;</p>
  <p>4) Police consciously refused to record incidents of communal violence as
  the government denied that such incidents took place from the very start;</p>
  <p>5) It is impossible to get the facts from those thousands of Hindus who
  fled to India from Bangladesh to save their lives, leaving behind all their
  belongings.</p>
  <p>Shahriar’s further observations are worth quoting </font><strong><font size="2" color="#008000">&quot;<i>Except
  during the nine months of the 1971 Independence War, such gruesome communal
  incidents never took place in the history of Bangladesh. In 1971 the attackers
  were outsiders, the Pakistani army, but this time it was more tragic and
  fearsome than that of 1971 - this time the attackers were Bengalis and
  neighbours of the victims. Those religious minority people who fled the
  country during the 1971 war came back after independence, but those who fled
  in 2001 told me that they would never return.</i>&quot;</font></strong></p>
  <font color="#000000" size="2">
  <p>Shahriar continued<i>, &quot;Social scientists have described the incidents
  of recent communal persecution in Bangladesh as nothing less than &quot;ethnic
  cleansing.&quot; Nearly three months ahead of the elections BNP-Jamaat
  gangsters publicly proclaimed that no Hindus could stay in Bangladesh, as
  these political parties believe that only non-Muslims support the Awami League
  and the easiest way to take revenge on their opponents was to resort to
  communal repression.</p>
  <p>The BNP-Jamat coalition government also believes, if the non-Muslims leave
  the country because of communal violence then¾ a) Awami League’s vote will
  shrink and b) it will be easier to turn Bangladesh into a monolithic Islamic
  country like Pakistan.</p>
  </font>
  <p><strong><font size="2" color="#008000">Our findings show that religious
  minorities irrespective of their party affiliations became victims of communal
  violence. Veteran educationist Gopal Krishna Muhuri, who supported the Workers
  Party, was killed in Chittagong by criminals affiliated with the Jamaat, while
  Buddhist Monks Gnanjyoty Mahathero, Dulal Barua and Hindu priest Madanmohan
  Goswami had no links with any political party. Despite promising to vote for
  the BNP, Bashana Rani, the mother of gang-raped minor girl Purnima of
  Sirajganj district, was not spared.</font></strong></p>
  <font color="#000000" size="2">
  <p>Thus it will be wrong to assume that only those who supported the Awami
  League were victims of communal repression, although there is definitely a
  political reason for which Awami League workers are facing repression for the
  last nine months. However, attacks on the religious minorities were basically
  communal in nature as they were attempts by fundamentalists to turn Bangladesh
  from a pluralist state to a monolithic one.</i>&quot;</p>
  <p>Mr. Shahriar Kabir is a brave fighter for upholding the cause of rights of
  deprived people those who suffer for being a member of weaker section of the
  population i.e. women, children, and minorities- ethnic, religious, cultural.
  This relentless fighter for secular and liberal democracy based on pluralism
  in our society and against any form of communalism and fundamentalism. He is
  an able organizers and actively engaged in the in the activities of many
  humanist organizations. This is amply demonstrated in the list of
  organizations he is currently associated with.</p>
  <p>Kabir, a popular juvenile writer, earned fame from his countrymen for which
  he was duly honoured. A serious writer in variegated topics Kabir tends to
  touch the hearts of the common men. Being a politically activist, though not
  connected with any political parties, he has genuine sympathy and support to
  those parties believing in equality of human being, secularism and social
  justices.</p>
  <p>A socially conscious humanist all his works, whether it is for the cause of
  deprived minority, for peace of the world, or unity for commoners on the
  platform for peace and justice, are oriented for the benefit of the common men
  and women and aimed to arouse social consciousness among the downtrodden
  people to fight against all form of injustice social or political
  discrimination.</p>
