		</font>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was most deeply disappointed 
		and mortified after listening two speeches one Oslo peace speech of <b>
		Dr. Mohammad Yunus</b> and the other one delivered by our ‘two in one 
		entity’ – the President and the Chief Adviser in <b>Dr. Iajuddin</b>, 
		who is now nicknamed as Rastrapati Yesuddin. I will not comment on Nobel 
		laureate Dr. Yunus’s Nobel pace speech except that it lamentably devoid 
		of world vision, miserably failing to address the real problems of peace 
		the world today is facing. His speech is narrow in outlook, devoid of 
		humanism projecting himself as a cleaver businessman who dreams to 
		eradicate poverty not only from Bangladesh but poverty from the entire 
		world, the poverty only to be seen in museums through his micro credit 
		banking and sugar coated social business, a modern form of Interest 
		mongering system of old Indian style. Thank god, the Nobel laureate did 
		not come up with yet another governance scheme of Bangladesh, nay a 
		formula with world government based on micro credit and social business 
		based economy and culture. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The president’s late night 
		nation wide broadcast mortified me more. He spoke not as a chief of the 
		non-party caretaker government or as a truly neutral non-partisan 
		President of Bangladesh but as a mouth peace of Bangladesh National 
		Party. He accused AL and other parties participating in movement for 
		reformation and reconstitution of the Election Commission in the same 
		language as were used by Begum Khaleda and Mr. Mannan Bhuiyan. He held 
		them responsible for chaotic law and order situation of the country and 
		deterioration of economy of the country because of their movement. 
		Iajuddin echoed the voice of his Party Boss erstwhile PM Khaleda. In 
		his behaviour, he all the time acted as a dictator forgetting that this 
		is a parliamentary form of government he must act in a collegiate 
		spirit. He must take collective decision as adopted in the meetings of 
		the council of advisers, which is equivalent to the cabinet in a 
		parliamentary form of government. He must execute those decision 
		faithfully and diligently. I may cite only a few instances where he 
		acted unilaterally defying the collective decision of the council of 
		advisers. One the advisers asked the CA to ask CEC justice Aziz to 
		resign, which the justice agreed to do so, but Dr. Iajuddin asked him 
		to go for two months leave on two conditions that (i) justice Aziz will 
		be in the country and enjoy all the benefits of CEC during his leave of 
		absence and (ii) that effective security would be provided to him. 
		Secondly, when one of the member Justice Mahfujur Rahman took over the 
		office of the chief election commissioner proclaiming himself as acting 
		CEC just after hearing the Presidential broadcast on TV on the following 
		morning without waiting for a single moment or for official formalities, 
		the obliging President did not utter a single word against this coup de 
		at. It was the President's prerogative to put some one in the office of 
		the CEC. The agreement was made between the CA and the advisers that 
		Justice Aziz, Justice Mahfujur Rahman and Mr. Jakaria will resign (or go 
		for a long vacation), and President will appoint one or two reputed non 
		controversial personalities as election commissioner making one them as 
		acting CECIL. But the CA or the Rastrapati intentionally made the deal a 
		mess perhaps at the instance of his mentor. He once again appointed two 
		new faceless EC one of them having BNP contact. Naturally instead of 
		solving the problem Iajuddin put gasoline to ignite the movement of the 
		frustrated 14 party alliance. Thirdly, when a fresh deal was arrived at 
		very recently, and the entire country felt a sigh of relief that the 
		advisers have at last arrived at a solution in the form of a package 
		that will create a congenial atmosphere for ensuing general election. 
		The President agreed to it and was willing to implement it. The deal had 
		two components (i) rescheduling the election date etc., and (ii) 
		reconstitution of the office of the EC. According to the package 
		formula, Mr. Jakaria and Mr. Modabbir, one of the newly appointed EC 
		either resign or go for a long vacation, and President will appoint one 
		or two new commissioners making one of them as acting CECIL. All 
		indications pointed out that Jakaria and Modabbir agreed to resign. But 
		the behind the scene activities in Bangabhavan jeopardized the package 
		as Jakaria and Modabbir refused to resign or go for vacation. The 
		President refused to implement the package proposal perhaps at the 
		instance of his behind the scene real masters, although election 
		reschedule was announced by the election commission. Even he said 'I am 
		not bound to implement whatever the advisers say, I will do what I think 
		right and good for the country.' This arrogance on the part of the 
		President infuriated the advisers particularly the fours who 
		subsequently resigned. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Fourthly, when the 14 party 
		alliance announced that it will go for gheraoing Bangabhavan, if the 
		President did not take steps to materialize the package formula toto, 
		the President held a meeting with his advisers in the evening of 
		December 10 regarding implementation of package formula and deployment 
		of army. President refused to agree with the proposal of reconstitution 
		of office of CE, and he asked for consent of the advisers to deploy army 
		immediately. On both counts the advisers disagreed with the president's 
		desire. They opined that situation is not so grave that time has come to 
		bring in army. They pointed out that package formula is the only 
		solution to overcome the present political crisis. But the President 
		decided to meet the crisis by force for which he ordered for deployment 
		of army. Accordingly army moved in to the Dhaka streets capturing 
		Bangabhaban immediately. It also moved to district head quarters. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the face of President's stern 
		and uncompromising attitude the four advisers had no other alternative 
		but to resign. And perhaps president was delighted at their exit from 
		the caretaker government as these four were seem to be hindrance to his 
		evil design and desire. The other six advisers are not that courageous 
		and dedicated whom the president will be able to maneuver. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Reaction of the resigning 
		advisers </font></b></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Four advisers, namely Dr. Akbar 
		Ali Khan, Mr. C A Shafi Sammi, Lt gen. (retired) Han Mashud Choudhury 
		resigned in the pre noon of December 11, when the President cancelled 
		his appointment with these four advisers at 10 am on the plea that he 
		had some important business. All of them said that their positions has 
		become untenable as they felt that they could not contribute to bring in 
		any fruitful solution for overcoming the political crisis for holding 
		the free and fair election. The main hindrance to holding fair election 
		is the election commission itself if it is not reconstituted in the 
		light of the last package deal. President is now adamant not to change 
		the present setup of the EC, and he has decided to face the political 
		movement directed against him by using military force. Thus the 
		president, acting unilaterally on his own at the instance of BNP 
		leadership, decided to put the military face to face with the mass. Is 
		it the right decision. The four advisers did not agree with the 
		president. They are of the opinion that a political crisis can't be or 
		must not be solved militarily. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am afraid that the scholarship 
		of Iajuddin does not permit to under stand the meaning of ‘collegiate’. 
		He totally ignored the package program developed by 10 advisers to 
		implement. He also took decision of deploying Army ignoring the advice 
		of his advisers. He sternly said to his colleagues that ‘Why he has to 
		abide by the decision of his colleagues. He would act on his own.’ This 
		disappointed the advisers. Dr. Iajuddin in many of his speeches 
		depicted the care taker government as ‘My Government’ indicating the 
		present setup is a ‘one man show’, directed from behind by his madam. 
		‘Yes madam, whatever you say.’ </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This gentleman is a glaring 
		example how does absolute power transfer even a spineless creature like 
		earthworm to a vertebrate as we find in Iajuddin. The resignation of 4 
		advisers following difference of opinion shows that accusation against 
		the Rastrapati is a BNP man has basis. It is now clear that under the 
		Present Rastrapati a fair and free election is impossibility. The 
		departure of the 4 advisers from the present caretaker government 
		plunges the country in despair and crisis. The BNP through its puppet 
		president wants to push the AL and its alliance to a point of no return 
		so that they are forced to declare not to participate in the election 
		leaving the field clean for Begum Zia. Under the circumstances what 
		would be the role of the army is any body’s guess. Will they stand 
		behind Begum Saheba to share her government’s misdeeds, corruptions and 
		failures? </font></p>
