	<h1>An Hour with Dr. Wajed Mian at Lab aid hospital</h1>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">I felt very sad when I learned from 
	the newspaper in the morning of July 18, 2007 that Dr. Wajed Mian, known to 
	the public as husband of AL Chief Sheikh Hasina fell ill and was taken to 
	Lab Aid Hospital, Dhanmondi. He is a cardiac patient for the last few years 
	and living a quiet life in Sudha Bhaban. Many perhaps do not know that Dr. 
	Wajed Mina has his separate distinct identity by his own right. He is a 
	theoretical physicist obtaining Ph. D degree from Imperial College, if my 
	memory does not betray me, under London University. He served Bangladesh 
	Atomic energy commission at Dhaka centre as a theoretical physicist and 
	finally became the Chairman of the commission just a few years of his 
	retirement. He was a dynamical personality. The AL government under Sheikh 
	Hasina did not extend his service although many assumed that Sheikh Hasina 
	would extend her husband’s service in the commission. But this did not 
	happened. Many opportune-seekers tried to induce Dr. Mian to press for it. 
	But Sheikh Hasina did not oblige those people nor Wajed pressed for the 
	extension. He was neither placed at any semi-government organizations, which 
	the then PM could have done easily for her husband, but she did not. This is 
	an example the then PM set. Dr. Wajed Mian on the other hand has never been 
	an obliging husband giving Hasina an OGL, rather on many issues he had 
	critical views. </p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify">And what a difference we witnessed 
	during the regime of Khaleda-Nizami alliance. Even the mediocre retired 
	official (civil and military) got extensions or appointments in big posts in 
	autonomous and semi autonomous bodies. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The other day I went to see 
	Wajed in his cabin at the 6<sup>th</sup> floor of the cardiac section of the 
	lab aid hospital. Wajed had been a student of mine in the physics 
	department, DU in early sixties when I was a junior teacher in the 
	department. He was one of the brilliant products of the department. I still 
	remember four of them- Farhad Faisal, Wajed Mian, Shamsuzzaman and Ashok, 
	all very brilliant. Farhad and Wajed did research in theoretical physics 
	under the supervision of Prof. Innas Ali, as far as I remember, whereas 
	Shamsuzzaman and Ashok did their research in EPR spectroscopy under me in M. 
	Sc class. All of them proved very successful in future in their respective 
	fields. Farhad, Wajed and Ashok turned into excellent physicists, former two 
	becoming theoreticians, whereas Ashok a theoretical solid-state physicist. 
	Farhad Faisal is in states now. I met Ashok at Oxford in late sixties where 
	he was then doing postdoctoral wok; since then I lost contact with him. On 
	the other hand Dr. Shamsuzzaman became an excellent bureaucrat, last time 
	serving as a secretary in ministry of cultural affairs, again if my memory 
	does not fail me. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Seeing the condition of 
	Wajed at the hospital, once a beloved student of mine I became more 
	mortified. He became very old with broken health and skinny although he has 
	not yet reached seventy. I saw him under heavy sedative. Hardly he could 
	talk to me, although he was very pleased to see me, uttered very feebly, 
	‘Sir, please pray for me. I am not well.’ I solaced him uttering an empty 
	solace, ‘don’t worry, everything would be alright.’ He gave me a faint smile 
	saying, ‘this time it won’t be that easy.’ I fully agree with him. He was 
	trying to say many things but could not as he was feeling sleepy. In fact he 
	went to deep sleep while talking to me. I did not disturb any more.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">There were not many 
	visitors. In fact I found him alone with a male attendant. I turned to him 
	enquiring if Wajed has any special problem. He told me that main problem 
	with Wajed is feeling of uneasiness and sense of insecurity. The cause of 
	his illness arose from the arrest of his wife and the way they inmates were 
	treated by the members of the combined force. He narrated the drama in Sudha 
	Bhavan played magnificently by the CTG and its mentor the army. He told me 
	under what condition their ‘Apa’ was taken to the police custody. According 
	to him the normal security personnel were withdrawn in the early morning. 
	Then a large number of police and people of combined force encircled the 
	residence forming three tier of security belt and blocking all roads leading 
	to Sudha Bhaban. Around 5-30 am the forces demanded to open the gate. But 
	internal and private security personnel refused to open the gate till 
	morning. But some time later they open the gate letting in hundreds of men 
	in uniform and police. They put all the inmates inside a room. The telephone 
	connections were snapped and all mobiles were taken away from all inmates. 
	Hasina was in her bedroom in first floor and Wajed was also pushed inside in 
	another room in the same floor. The force searched the entire house. 
	According to him, Hasina took the raid very calmly and was composed, but 
	Wajed was very upset and almost trembling with fear. Sheikh Hasina refused 
	to go with them till morning. She demanded to the officer in charge of the 
	operation under what charge they were arresting her, and did they have any 
	warrant. The officer only asked her to accompany them- they neither could 
	say about the charges nor could show any warrant order. After performing the 
	Morning Prayer she came down to ground floor and gave herself to force. 
	Everybody now knows next episode. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The inmates were kept 
	inside a room with Wajed also kept interned in his room till 2 pm. At this 
	stage Dr. Mian felt very ill and his doctor at Lab Aid Hospital advised the 
	inmates to transfer him immediately to the hospital. Since then he is in the 
	hospital alone and almost without touch of caring hand of love and 
	affection. I feel pity for my erstwhile student and left his cabin with 
	tears in my eyes. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">What a melancholy episode- 
	son and daughter away from to distant land and wife anguishing in a sub 
	jail, who is being refused to see by her relatives and even her legal teams. 
	Must the authority have to be devoid of humanity? Sheikh Hasina expressed 
	her fear to his only lawyer permitted to see that she did not expect fair 
	treatment and justice from the present government. She complained that their 
	motive is to disqualify her from election through the punishment of few 
	years jail in a false case(s). We can only hope and pray that our judicial 
	system will stand above the threat of executives – civil and army and upheld 
	the justice as did Pakistan Apex court very recently by reinstating the 
	Chief Justice of Pakistan supreme 
	court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
