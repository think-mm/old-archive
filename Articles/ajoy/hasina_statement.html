	<h1 align="center" style="text-align:center"><font color="#800000">Statement 
	of AL chief at the Dhaka Metropolitan Court</font></h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
	<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: #0000FF">Ajoy Roy</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">After being picked up from 
	Sudha Sadan by the joint force in a dramatic manner she was taken to Dhaka 
	Metropolitan court at about 7-30. In the drama not less than thousand member 
	strong force took part. I clearly remember even when Bangabandhu was killed 
	by a section of military personnel only a handful of armed men took part. 
	What a fun! An unarmed women who happened to be once PM of the country and 
	chief of a most popular political party of democratic tradition has to be 
	arrested with strong force of thousands armed members. When she was being 
	taken to the local court at 7-30 pm her prison van was followed by a convoy 
	14 vehicles. In this sense the government gave her real VVIP treatment.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">At about 8 am she was 
	produced before the court of Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Quamrunnahar. The 
	public prosecutor moved the case showing the documents of the case filed by 
	one businessman Ajam J Choudhury at the PS Gulshan on 13<sup>th</sup> June. 
	The prosecutor told the court that former PM Hasina has been arrested in 
	connection of this case. The PP appealed to the court that in the interest 
	of the prosecution she should be sent to jail. The lawyers of Hasina led by 
	ex-law minister advocate Abdul Matin Khasru argued for bail without success. 
	They argued that the case is a fabricated one and conspiratory in nature. In 
	the case nowhere the word ‘Extortion’ (<i>chandabaji</i>) was used, argued 
	Advocate Sahara Khatun. The court after hearing the two sides ordered a 
	detention of one month in the jail. She was then moved to a house in the 
	campus of Jatiya Sangsa hurriedly converted to a sub jail.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the court erstwhile PM 
	and AL chief Sheikh Hasina addressed the court for 35 minutes pleading her 
	ignorance in the case brought against her on June 13, 2007. Following is the 
	brief report on her statement at the metropolitan court.&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Statement of Hasina<b>&nbsp;</b></h2>
	<p class="MsoBodyText">Ex PM began her statement alleging that the present 
	government brought this false case against her, so that “I can not 
	participate in the coming general election.” She alleged, “At about 5 am the 
	members of joint force informed me that they had come to arrest me. When I 
	asked them did they have any arrest warrant, avoided the question saying 
	that they were there at the ‘order of the top’. I then accompanied them 
	silently in black glass covered prison jeep.” </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Hasina continued at the 
	court, “I just now come to know that I have been charged with case of 
	‘Extortion’ for which the government has arrested me. Me lord, since three 
	generations our family is more or less economically solvent. Our family 
	property is still undivided (ajmali) and we never felt splitting among the 
	sharers. The poor and common men enjoy most of our property. The property at 
	Dhaka has been transferred to the Trust. <i>I have no property of my own</i>. 
	My husband is a Nuclear Physicist who had built the Sudha Sadan out of his 
	income earned while he worked abroad for several years and he lives in this 
	house. I have no greed for wealth for that reason I did not acquired any 
	property or wealth. I had a struggling life of 60 years. So question of 
	extorting money from others does not arise. My father, most of his life, had 
	spent in jails of Pakistan. I myself was interned and gave birth to my first 
	son Joy while I was interned by the Pakistanis. I had never affectionately 
	insisted my parents for anything nor I, any time, lovingly requested my 
	husband even for a <i>Shari</i>. So demanding money from others I cannot 
	dream of. Not a single person in this country would believe this 
	allegation.”</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“From the student life I was 
	associated with politics while I was a school student at Azimpur Gils’ 
	School and I was a VP in Badrunnesa College”, continued the AL Chief. “In 
	the college I was General secretary and vice president of Students’ League. 
	Never in my life I have demanded anything wrongly. I have been associated 
	with many democratic movements and struggles in this country. In 1971 along 
	with my father our family suffered. Pakistanis once decided to eliminate our 
	entire family while we were interned at their hands. But ultimately 
	Pakistani minded army personnel of BD army killed my father, mother, younger 
	brothers and many relatives in 1975. Thank God we (my self, my husband and 
	Rehana) were at that time away from the country in Germany. In 2005 on 21 
	August I was again threatened with my life when grenades were thrown 
	targeting me and other top AL leaders. I was threatened of life at least 19 
	times. But I am not afraid of these. I only fear almighty Allah and none 
	else.”&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Sheikh Hasina further said, 
	“If I had thrust for wealth I could have earned for my children who could 
	then lead a lavish life without doing anything. My son and daughter earn 
	their livelihood by doing jobs- they are not dependent on me. My son Joy has 
	two degrees in computer technology and he is managing his life through 
	academic pursuit. I was involved in wrong practices they would not have 
	struggled so much. My father did politics for the common men and made 
	supreme sacrifice for his country. Following the footsteps of my father I 
	dedicated my life for the welfare of my countrymen. I have no other ambition 
	except to serve my people in a humble way. Only Allah above and my people in 
	this world have the right to try me, none else.”&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“After the liberation, only 
	twice civil governments came to power one under the Bangabandhu and the 
	second one under my premiership. And during those periods country witnessed 
	visible development. During my tenure as Prime Minister, Ganges sharing 
	pact, Chittagong hill tracts peace talks were signed. Before 2001, then 1600 
	MW electricity was produced. After we took over, our government increased 
	the production to the tune of 4000 MW. When we took over the food stock was 
	1 crore 90 lakh tons and when we left the government the stock was 2 crore 
	70 lakh tons. During AL government the rice was sold at Tk 10 per Kg and 
	Soyabin oil was sold at Tk 28 per liter.”&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Addressing the court she 
	continued, “ We bought Mig 29 jet fighters at a price of only 119 crore 
	billions US dollars instead of real price of 289 crore billions US dollars.” 
	Regarding extortion of money for the party she said, “ The usual practice 
	for maintaining party expenses always had been that the party supporters and 
	well wishers spontaneously give subscription and donations to the party 
	fund. We must distinguish between ‘extortion’ (<i>chnadabaji</i>) and 
	‘subscription (<i>chanda</i>). This is the time honoured practice how a 
	political party conducts its affairs in financial matters.”&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“We launched movement for 
	transparent ballot box and right voters list- none of the demands has been 
	materialized. The road map for election recently declared by the EC is 
	nothing but a staged drama. The road map election result has already been 
	made too.” Addressing the judge, she remarked, “Though you are the symbol 
	justice, you have no power to deliver justice. You have been given ideas 
	what to do with me. We took several steps to make judiciary an independent 
	system. Our government appointed first lady justice, recruited women in 
	police and army. I want economic emancipation of the people; without 
	economic emancipation democracy does not take roots and without democracy, 
	peoples’ development is an impossibility.”&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Turning to the police, she 
	asked them, “You did go to the bazzar yesterday; was the goods so costly in 
	my time ? “&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Now the entire effort is to 
	break the political parties. There could not be democracy if you destroy 
	politics and political parties. Without democracy state becomes a failed 
	one. If there is no democracy there won’t be any independence of judicial 
	system and there would be no rule of law. &nbsp;</p>
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">In order to 
	snatch away my rights this false charge has been brought in against me. I am 
	completely innocent. I want justice, yes real justice. For the sake of my 
	people whom I love so much I came back to my country against all odds and 
	forgetting the love and affection of my son and daughter. My countrymen love 
	Awami League and me. This false case has been brought against me so that I 
	cannot contest in the election and AL could not win the election. This is 
	the objective of the government..”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
