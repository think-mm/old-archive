  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Dear Muktomonas,&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  With a heavy heart and deep sense of shock let me inform you that your beloved 
  friend-philosopher-guide Dr. Humayun Azad, my learned colleague, has been laid 
  to rest in his village home graveyard at <i>Rareekhal</i> under old Pargana <i>
  Vikrampur</i> now under a new district named Munshigang. Vikrampur is the 
  birth place of many great sons of Bengal including Atis Deepankar, great 
  Bhudist Scholar of ancient Bengal and Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, the great 
  physicist and botanist of modern Bengal. Dr, Humayun Azad is another great son 
  of Vikrampur whose contribution to Bengali language and literature would be 
  remembered for long time to come. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  In the evening when his body reached his village home, the common mass broke 
  into tears remembering their beloved son who brought fame not only for himself 
  but also for the entire Vikrampur. Humayun in his lifetime used to utter ‘ I 
  sleep only to see another new sun in my village, to hear the murmuring sound 
  of the river that flows through his village.’ Alas, Humayun will never awake 
  from his eternal sleep to listen the whistling sound of wind, the mild 
  rhythmic melodies of birds, hissing sound of green leaves of trees, or to see 
  the wavy movement of yellow paddies on the field, the sleep he fell in at his 
  Munich apartment. He was a great lover of nature.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  Earlier his body arrived at Zia International airport, Dhaka at 1-25 p.m. from 
  Frankfurt. His wife and younger son Anannya at the airport, which took not 
  less than two hours to complete the formalities, received his body. At the 
  airport the president and secretary of DUTA Prof. Arefin and Prof. 
  Akhteruzzaman respectively accompanied Mrs. Azad and her family members. The 
  acting German Charge de affairs was also present. After the completion of 
  airport formalities his body was taken to his university apartment 14/D, 
  Fuller Road amidst tight security all the way from airport to university 
  campus at 3-15 p.m. I was there. I saw how his two daughters, Mrs Azad and 
  host of his relatives broke into tears, as his coffin was open. It is simply 
  unbearable. For the last time, I look at his face lying in the coffin as if 
  still in deep sleep.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  The body was then taken to <i>Aparajeya Bangla</i> in the campus, where his 
  colleagues of the department of Bengali, other teachers and students paid 
  their last respect. It is quite antipathy that Dr. Humayun Azad’s mortal body 
  was taken to University mosque where a <i>namaje janaja</i> was held conducted 
  by Imam of the mosque. The atheist is offered religious rituals for 
  emancipation of his soul, which in his lifetime he did not believe. But 
  mockery has no limit, Dr. Wakil Ahmed, a BNP brand-intelligentsia, and who is 
  just a pigmy in intellectualism in comparison to Late Azad and a opposer to 
  ideals Hmayun stood for, was paying tributes saying, ‘<i><span style="color: blue">He 
  was great writer. In his death we lost a prolific writer.</span></i>’ What a 
  shame his scholarship is being gauged by a pigmy who in presence of Azad would 
  never dare to open his mouth. After the <i>namje janaja</i> he was taken to <i>
  Central Shahid Minar</i> at 4 p.m. where a large number of common people, his 
  friends, well-wishers, colleagues and national leaders paid last respect. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  I stood in a long queue to pay my last respect with a bunch of wild flowers to 
  my one time colleague and a co-fighter against communalism, fundamentalism and 
  Mullahism. Will Azad be in heaven, the existence of which he never believed, 
  or will he be roasted continuously in <i>habia dojokh</i> till his soul is 
  purified for his anti-Islamic activities in earth for which Mullahs attempted 
  many a times to kill him. How could I forget and forgive these Mollahs and 
  fundamentalists who made the life of Humayun and his family hell. Will the 
  almighty great Allah forgive these creatures in human form? I don’t 
  know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
