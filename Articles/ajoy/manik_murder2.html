  <p>Journalist Manik Saha cremated with state honour.</p>
  </font></u>
  <p align="justify">Noted journalist late Manik Saha was cremated day before
  yesterday (16<sup>th</sup> January) afternoon with full state honour. The city
  looked mortified and still shocked, streets deserted. A total hartal was
  observed, no shops were open, no vehicles seen to ply. Thousands people that
  include elites of the society, his lawyer, journalist and political
  colleagues, host of friends, well-wishers, relatives and common mass attended
  the last rituals. His dead body- covered with Bangladesh Flag was brought to
  the press club premise at 9 a.m. There was no room for people in around the
  premise. First wreath was placed in his honour on behalf of the press club
  followed by various organizations : Khulna Journalist union, Khulna
  Metropolitan journalist union, Journalists Association, Press club workers
  union, Awami League, Dainik Purbanchal, Dainik Janmabhumi, Rajpather dabi,
  Dainik Prabartan, Dainik Loka Samaj, Udichi, Sammilita Sanskritik Jote, Khulna
  Unnayan Sangram Samannay Committee, Mangla C&amp;F Association, Muktiyodhha
  Sangsad, Combined Business Organizations, United Civil Movement, Puja Udjapan
  Kamiti, Satkhira reporters club and many other organizations. The political
  organizations that placed wreaths included Awami League, Jatiya Party,
  Bangladesh National Party, Information minister, the city mayor, Bangladesh
  Samajtantrik dal, CPB and its president Manjurul Ahsan Khan. The coffin got
  covered with flowers. At 11 a.m. the late journalist who was also a gallant
  freedom fighter was given state guard honour. The body was then carried to
  different places with which the late journalist was closely associated. These
  are Temple of Dharmasabha, office of the CPB, where last tribute was offered
  on behalf of the party, Ratan Sen Public library, office of Udichi
  Shilpigosthi and then finally to his residence, where his relatives, friends
  and many political leaders paid last respect to the beloved and brave son of
  Khulna. The leaders solaced the crying members of the bereaved family. In the
  after noon his body was then taken to Temple of Shiva on way to cremation bank
  of River Rupsa where cremation took place around 4 p.m.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">In the evening (16. 01. 04) a condolence meeting was held
  at the local press club under the chairmanship of Mr. Humayun Kabir, president
  of the club. The meeting was addressed by among others Manjurul Ahsan Khan,
  CPB president, Iqbal Hosain Choudhury, President, BFUJ, Akhter Ahmed,
  Secretary general, Jakir Husain, Manir Ahmed, Liaqat Ali, M. A. Salam ...</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The procession of the Students Union brought out in support
  of the Saturday hartal demanded the resignation of the interior (home)
  minister and police commissioner. It is learnt that a terrorist group claiming
  to be East Bengal Communist Party (ML) expressed its indignation over the
  event through a fax.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <font color="#7f0000" size="4">
  <p align="justify">Police failure, two cases filed</font>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">So far police administration failed to trace the real
  killers nor they could discover yet any clue for motive of killing of the
  widely respected journalist Manik Babu. They have hover arrested one person
  named Ananda, a person known to be as enlisted terrorists associated with bomb
  explosion. They were also trying to get hold of the concerned rickshaw puller
  for interrogation. So far they failed.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The Khulna police last Saturday, 17<sup>th</sup> January,
  filed two cases (i) one under the penal code associated with killing and (ii)
  under another penal code dealing with explosions. The OC of Khulan Police
  station was the plaintiff. In the deposition (<i>ejahar</i>) no motive was
  mentioned nor any name(s) appeared as killers or their collaborators.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <font color="#7f0000" size="4">
  <p align="justify">Khulna: A city of Processions</font>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The hartal of Saturday and Sunday (18. 01. 04) made three
  districts (Khulna, Bagerhat and Satkhira) almost stand still. A complete
  hartal was observed in the city, which was called by the Khulna Press Club and
  the CPB. Except one or two rickshaws, everything was closed. All ferry ghats
  were closed; no long distance buses either departed or arrived. But Khulna
  became a city of processions demanding immediate arrest of the killers.
  Processions were brought out by the 11 party alliance, Awami League,
  Journalists of the city, Students’ union, Students’ League, Puja Udjapan
  Kamiti and many other organizations. Even BNP brought out a procession
  protesting the killing. No untoward incident took place except a few
  journalists were assaulted near Shantidham Corner by a group of policemen. The
  police administration took appropriate action against them, it is learnt.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">In the meanwhile, journalists of the city issued an
  ultimatum (17. 01. 04) of 72 hours within which they demanded the arrest of
  the culprits who were involved in the killing. They further demanded for
  safety of the journalists and asked the PM as well as leader of the opposition
  to do the needful in this respect. The local AL gave Sunday’s hartal call.
  The journalist brought out a silence procession and moved to the DC’s office
  (18. 01. 04) where they handed over a memorandum to the PM as well as to the
  Interior minister. The memorandum urged upon the PM and the minister concerned
  for personal intervention. The journalists further demanded to the city mayor
  to rename the street as Manik Shaha Street where the journalist was killed.
  Awami League held a protest meeting after the end of the hartal, which was
  addressed by the local AL leaders. 11 party also brought out procession on
  Sunday led by Worker Party’s President Rashed Khan Menon.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">From Saturday (17. 01. 04), a temporary platform (<i>mancha</i>)
  was erected near the place where the journalist breathed his last. From 12
  noon – 4 p.m. local journalist leaders made speeches and observed a token
  hunger strike. The notables who took part in the hunger strike were Humayun
  Kabir, President of the press club, Wadudur Rahman Panna, Saheb Ali, Hasan
  Ahmed Molla.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <font color="#7f0000" size="4">
  <p align="justify">The Interior Minister broke his silence</font>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">At last our onetime talkative and extra zealous interior
  minister Mr. Altaf Husain Choudhury broke his silence. In a meeting of the
  parliamentary standing committee for interior affairs he assured (18. 01. 04)
  us that his very able police administration and other special investigating
  teams are working round the clock to arrest the killers. Talking to the
  journalists he complemented the late journalist by calling him a great freedom
  fighter, a brave journalist and a social worker. He expressed his surprise to
  the criticism of so far police failure by saying, &quot; <i>Killer’ ra ki
  kothao, kakhono benche thakte paerechhe ? Ainer hat anek lamaba</i>&quot;
  (were the killers anytime anywhere able to escape ? The hands of law are too
  long to escape from.). &quot;Mr. Saha, a close friend of mine,&quot; claimed
  Mr. Interior minister, &quot;had no enemies as far as I knew. And even he had
  enemies, we are trying to arrest those killers. Police and other detective
  branches are working in this regard day and night.&quot;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">We wish your success Mr. Minister, but your past records do
  not encourage us.</p>
