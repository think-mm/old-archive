  <p><b><font size="4" color="#008000">A Housewife of Dhunat punished with 101 
  dorrah twice:</font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Yes practice of dorrah on the delicate 
  and fragile bodies of young girls continues un-protested. In my previous few 
  reports I gave few examples how fatowa, an well known Islamic Institution was 
  used against our rural womenfolk by the village touts and so called leaders in 
  the name of preserving sanctity of the society. In most cases helpless women 
  become their target of pleasure. Unfortunately the local imam of the Masjid is 
  called upon to pronounce the fatowa-prescribed punishment and the punishment 
  is usually carried out in his presence and approval. It is a pity that there 
  is no united social movement against this malpractice. Here is another story 
  of a village housewife of Dhunat Upazila in the district of Bogra. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A peace-loving couple named Ismail 
  Hosain-Anguri Khatun lives in a village Dhigalkandi in Dhunat Upazila in the 
  district of Bogra happily. Anguri Khatun, a pretty looking girl is the mother 
  of two sons. As the report goes about a month back one Mansur Ali, a neighbor 
  of the couple and father of a son, forcibly entered the room of the couple at 
  night. Hearing the cry of Anguri Khatun other members of the family and 
  neighboring people held said Mansur Ali red handed while he was attempting to 
  commit sexual violence. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The village Salish committee 
  (arbitration committee) consisting of so-called social leaders (in fact some 
  mollhas and fanatics) of the village issued a fatowa against the young wife 
  prescribing, as expected, 100 dorrahs (whipping by cane or lace made of 
  leather) and a fine of Tk 8,000/- was imposed to the main offender Mansur Ali. 
  The punishment against the young lady was duly carried out in presence of the 
  local masjid imam. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The persecuted housewife when filed a 
  written complain with the Dhunat police station the village touts who formed 
  the fatowa committee got furious and outcasted her family asking the family to 
  leave the village. On the last Eid day (11 January, 2006) congregation at the 
  local Eidgah when the family appealed to the assembled musullihs to reinstate 
  the family socially, the village touts rejecting the prayer of the couple 
  ordered for another one hundred dorrahs to be executed against the delicate 
  body of the lovely and dear wife of Ismail Hosain. Would you believe that in 
  presence of hundreds of pious Muslims and the imam of the mosque, punishment 
  was carried out to the perverse pleasure of those village touts, mastans and 
  fanatics? It is a pity none of the Musullihs, the follower of Great Prophet of 
  Islam did have the courage to stand by the wretched woman. And Islam claims 
  for equality of men and women! What a mockery of the term equality.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the imam was asked being a 
  religious and pious man and leader in the religious affairs how could he allow 
  such terrible thing in the name Islam to take place, the imam had no answer. 
  He only murmured that he did not prescribe for fatowa, it was uttered by the 
  leader of village matabbars one Matabbar Habibur Rahman; the imam claimed that 
  he was present there during execution of dorrahs under pressure from those 
  touts. Needless to say the poor young lady got ailed and sick. Even under such 
  condition the couple was not allowed to stay in their house. They were driven 
  out from their home. Finding no way out the couple with their children took 
  shelter in her fathers residence in another village Guaganti under Sherpur 
  Upazila of the same district where she was now under medical care. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On 14th January, at last a team of 
  police force of Dhunat visited the place of occurrence and recorded a case 
  against five accused including that gang leader Matabbar Habib Rahman. 
  Needless to say these matabbars of the village are given political and muscle 
  support from the mastans of the ruling parties, otherwise they would not have 
  the courage to do so. As a result no arrest have been made so far. All police 
  actions are mere eyewash. </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">May I appeal to our free thinkers 
    MM members- Please raise your voice of protests against those fatowabazis 
    and come forward to stand beside the poor and helpless girls, our beloved 
    and respected womenfolk. Save them from the Islamic fanatics. </font></b>
