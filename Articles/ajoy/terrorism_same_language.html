	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After 13 years of demolition of 
	Babri Mosque by Hindu militants, a group of extremist militants attempted to 
	blow out the makeshift Rama Temple near the site of ancient Rama Mandir over 
	which the emperor Babar, claimed by the militant Hindus, built a mosque- 
	later to be known as ‘Babri Masjid’. The day chosen by the militants was 
	July 5, 2005 and time set was 9 a.m. In an attempt to demolish the temporary 
	Rama Mandir, the five militants lost their lives by the security personnel. 
	The security police strictly maintains full proof security system so that 
	even a fly can not approach the site with out being sighted The site is 
	demarcated into several zones- green- a zone safe for everybody, yellow- the 
	warning zone, and the red zone- where nobody is allowed to enter. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On July 5 early morning, at about 
	9-15 a.m. a white jeep was found rushing towards the makeshift Rama Temple 
	complex with cracking sound of grenade and firing bullets. Through the smoky 
	atmosphere the jeep attempted to enter into the yellow zone about 70 km from 
	the red zone. The security personnel immediately sprang into action to stop 
	the speedy vehicle. A melee followed and battle of exchange of fire soon 
	began between the militants and the security personnel. The battle lasted 
	for two hours in which it was found that five militants were killed. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The security chief of the 
	paramilitary system of the area said “We must admit that they (militants) 
	came dangerously close to the red zone (2.7 acre area and the makeshift 
	temple) and just 70 meters away from the site of the temple.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The eyewitnesses say that the 
	terrorist group blasted their way by exploding bombs, storming behind a hail 
	of bullets and bursting grenades around 9.15 a.m. The patrolling guards 
	shouted that the arrival of attacking militants. Though stunned by sudden 
	explosion the security personnel immediately fought back the terrorists’ 
	attack, and thank god, they foiled the militants’ objective of blowing the 
	temporary temple of god Rama. Had they been successful, no body knew what 
	could follow- another Gujrat episode? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the fight three CRPF security men 
	and another of Provincial armed constabulary were wounded. The incident once 
	again proved the vulnerability of the public place to terrorist attack, no 
	matter whatever be the tight security system is. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It was revealed later that the 
	attackers hired a white Mahendra &amp; Mahendra jeep from the Taxi stand at 
	Faizabad at 8 a.m. They drove up to 80 acre temple complex in the vehicle at 
	9 a.m. The jeep was parked at nearby place. Then five militants walked away 
	after parking the jeep, which after half an hour blew up. The jeep was hired 
	at a price of Rs 1300. According to driver’s statement the group came from 
	Akbarpur about 60 km from the place of occurrence and first went to Sarayu 
	River 3-4 km from the temple complex. They told the driver that on their way 
	back they intended to visit the Rama temple complex. As they were driving 
	toward the complex, at one stage one of the militants wanted to drive the 
	jeep himself to which the driver objected vehemently. He was then kicked out 
	of the jeep. The driver went to the nearby police station, but by that time 
	the incident had taken place. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The BJP chief LK Advani complained 
	that since the UPA government under Manmohan Singh took over, the security 
	system had become lax. The PM said after the incident took place “the entire 
	country was shocked by the dastardly terrorist attack … We will never 
	compromise with terrorism. … There should not be any doubt in any body’s 
	mind. “ </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After the London explosion the 
	Indian PM, who has been attending G8 summit at Sydney commented, “From 
	Ayodhya to London the terrorism, has same pattern” pledging to fight against 
	terrorism united on international as well as at local level. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The security later on discovered 3 
	AK Rifles, 17 grenades, a rocket launcher type weapon, mobile phones, some 
	currencies and some documents from the possession of the dead militants.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the crossfire an elderly lady 
	Shanta Devi (72) was found dead, obviously she came to the Mandir to pay her 
	regards to Rama. The battle took place in the yellow zone, which means that 
	the militants successful pierced through the outer defence and security 
	system, which was rather alarming. Since the severe terrorist attacks on 
	Indian Parliament at New Delhi and Aksaradham complex, a finest temple of 
	Swaminarayan from architectural point of view, at Ahmedabad several years’ 
	back, this is the most severe attempt made by the militants. No terrorist so 
	far claimed the credit of the operation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However Indian circles point out to 
	the Pakistan based terrorists group including the Al Quieda group(s) based 
	in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The daily Dinkal published from Calcutta found 
	Pakistani militants’ hands in the assault. The Indian intelligent 
	department(s) although publicly did not utter, but appeared to be convinced 
	that they have enough proofs that members of the militant group taking part 
	in the assault belonged to Pakistan based militant organization ‘Laskar I 
	Toiyeba’ or ‘Jayash I Muhammad’. The sources nearer to the interior ministry 
	believed that the ministry had prior knowledge of arrival of 15-20 militants 
	at New Delhi about a month ago. Their mission was to demolish temporarily 
	erected Rama temple, but the tight security system inside the complex foiled 
	their attempt. The object of demolishing the site was to make sure that in 
	future no Rama Temple could be erected in view of the Supreme Court’s stay 
	order. A few months back a few militants were arrested following bomb 
	explosions in New Delhi cinema Hall, which was followed by an attempted 
	terrorist assault on Indian Military Academy in Dehradun in which again a 
	few terrorists were arrested. The intelligence source in India believe that 
	a meeting took place in the month of April between Pakistani ISI chief Mr. 
	Ehsan ul Haq and Laskar chief Hafiz Muhammad Sayid &amp; Jayash-leader Masud 
	Azahar in a Pakistani town Dera Gazi Khan. In this meeting a blue print of 
	terrorist activities on religious places and some industrially and 
	economically important establishments was made. Ram-temple operation is one 
	such plan that failed because of Indian security system in Rama-temple 
	complex. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indian public including Muslim 
	religious leaders condemned the incident. The PM appealed to the political 
	leaders not over play the incident and called for restrain urging all 
	quarters not to issue emotional and provocative statements on Ayodhya. The 
	militant organizations like RSS, Viswa Hindu Parisad and BJP criticized 
	Mulayem Sing Jadab’s UP government and the central government of India for 
	failure of security system. The situation seems to be under control- no 
	serious communal violence anywhere in India so far been reported. It is a 
	good sign. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We appeal to the secularist forces 
	throughout India to be on guard to foil any communal violence using the 
	incident as a plea- the communalist force in Pakistan and Bangladesh 
	precisely wanting this. We the secularists have much greater responsibility 
	and a vital role to play in stopping fundamentalists’ design. </font></p>
