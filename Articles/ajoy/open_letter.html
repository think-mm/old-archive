		<h1 style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">To overcome the 
		present crisis, apart from the political parties and leaders of 
		different shades, the civil society, conscious individuals are writing, 
		issuing statements, expressing opinions in seminars and discussion 
		forums; different citizens’ forum are organizing variety of programmes 
		in which various shades of opinions are being expressed- all directed to 
		unlock the present deadlock and ease the tensed situation obtaining 
		among the opposing political parties and their front organizations. The 
		dialogue between the Secretary General Mr. Mannan Bhuiyan, representing 
		BNP and General Secretary Mr. M A Jalil, on behalf of AL, being 
		initiated by the leaders of the business community, is still continuing 
		to find a mutually acceptable solution. There were already as many as 5 
		sittings, though held under a very cordial atmosphere, yet the dialogue 
		failed to bring out fruitful result yet. The sixth sitting is scheduled 
		to come of on October 23. </span></h1>

		<h1 style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Although the list of 
		agenda to cover in the dialogue is quite long, the discussion centered 
		around three themes, the key points of reformations suggested by AL and

		will be appointed by the President is a very difficult question to sort 
		out, but the answer to this big question must be found out by the two 
		persons involved in the negotiating table and the parties they are 
		representing. They have to find the solution to save the country from 
		chaos and confusion. In this regard the combined 14 party opposition has 
		already placed their formula of solutions publicly as well as in the 
		parliament. But to the best of my knowledge, the Party(s) in power has 
		not placed any such formulas in public. They have only, time and again

		The14-party alliance led by AL has never accepted the Election

		mass including the civil society has no faith in the capability of 
		Justice Aziz and his 4 colleagues that the election commission under 
		them is competent to run the huge business like conduction of election 
		with efficiency and strict neutrality. Once Justice Aziz compared the 
		commission just as a ‘post box’. No, learned justice, in spite its 
		manifold limitations, the election commission is not just a post box, it 
		is a strong institution which has to run the election with strong &amp; farm 
		hand with utmost honesty, sincerity and strict neutrality. Had it been a 
		post box the man like Justice Aziz need not occupy that coveted and

		Question has arisen regarding who will be the ultimate authority under 
		whom the armed forces will be placed. According to present provision, 
		the authority and responsibility lies with the President. But in the 
		light of the experience of the last two general elections the opposition 
		demands that overall responsibility of the armed forces must be placed 
		at the disposal and authority of the chief adviser of the caretaker 
		government. Because, they argue that during normal period President acts 
		as constitutional head at the advise of the PM, but in a caretaker type 
		of government the President enjoys certain executive powers too. And the 
		conflict lies in here. The opposition argues that even the present 
		President is not above political party interest. Because the president 
		had close connection with the BNP in the past, he is known as a BNP 
		intellectual and he held many big government positions in the past at 
		the grace of BNP.&nbsp; </span></h1>

		opposition stand still to their respective positions then there would be 
		no fruitful and positive outcome of the continuing dialogues between the 
		two leaders, the outcome that will be helpful to pave the way of 
		formation of a non-party neutral government and holding a meaningful 
		election satisfying all concerned.</span></h1>

		<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">I have cited the 
		stand and contention of the opposition parties above. What the secret 
		strategy and instructions the BNP high command and their allies gave to 
		BNP Secretary General Mr. Bhuiyan to be adopted in the negotiating table 
		are not known to us. But the open stand of the PM, and her party 
		including the alliance is quite clear, ‘<u>whatever to be done must be 
		done according to and under the jurisdiction of the constitution</u>.’ 
		Does the meaning of the contention stands out that reformative proposals 
		are to be termed as unconstitutional and materialization of their 
		suggestions has to be done in an extra-constitutional way(s)? To the 
		extent their stand on the reformation proposals appearing in the dailies 
		and other media we have not noted that any where they demanded that 
		their suggested formula of making a non-party caretaker government for 
		the purpose of holding a truly neutral election has to be materialized 
		in an unconstitutional methods. The proposals were placed before the 
		members of the parliament in a constitutional manner. Rest of the to and 
		fro story is known to all. If the government had the sincerity and good 
		will some positive steps could have been arrived at long before 
		regarding formation of a caretaker government acceptable to all, more or 
		less, and if necessary the government could have taken initiative to 
		change the constitution in the light of the agreed formula. But the 
		government abandoned the path of understanding and stick to follow the 
		spirit of letters, comas, fool stops of the constitution. Begum Khaleda, 
		PM and her government chose to evil strategy of killing time, and thus 
		brought the country to the door of present crisis, and for this

		believe. And I believe you are the victim of a complex situation. </span>
		<font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></h1>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Those who want 
		you to see as chief of the coming caretaker government they very naively 
		are continuously saying that when according to the constitution `he’ is 
		to occupy that position then what has the government to do, or what the 
		BNP or other parties of the alliance could do in such situation ? These 
		people are knowingly sinners- adopted the ill strategy of by passing the 
		serious issue. One of the strong pillars of the 4-party alliance 
		government of Begum Khaleda and Moulana Nizami, the law minister 
		recently remarked, “Why should justice Hasan feel embarrassed or express 
		inability in accepting the position of the chief adviser? The 
		constitution has given him the right to fulfill that constitutional 
		obligation.” (Bhorer Kagoj, October 21, 2006). Position of the Jamat, an 
		important partner of the alliance is quite clear, when it says, “The 
		caretaker government will be formed under the leadership of Hasan”. 
		Jamat secretary general said clearly, “We cannot go beyond constitution, 
		and we will not go.” Another leader of the 4-party alliance, Janab Mufti 
		Ameen has said, “If the election is held under constitution, the Awami 
		League knows for sure that it will not be voted to power. For that very 
		reason the Awami League leadership is not agreeing to accept Justice K M 
		Hasan.” The communication minister satirically said, punched with humor, 
		that Mr. Mannan Bhuiyan is making all out effort to make Mr. Jalil, the 
		general secretary of AL, to understand the constitutional procedure of 
		forming a caretaker government and appointing its chief adviser as laid 
		down in the constitution so that AL understands and agrees with BNP’s 
		stand. For this very reason the dialogue is taking such a long time. 
		What a childish and low graded humor it is over a serious matter. This 
		reflects what is the motif of the Party in power and how lightly the 
		government took the dialogue. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Respected Justice, </span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Are you of the 
		same opinion as has been expressed by the leaders of the 4-party 
		alliance and are you considering or would consider the entire matter so 
		lightly? These people are expressing these sorts of opinions directly 
		uttering your name; even after seeing this don’t you think that these 
		light hearted men are not considering the present crisis with due 
		seriousness it deserves ? Even in this critical moment, the country and 
		the nation is deeply in, will you also in tune with their music keep 
		yourself mum, thereby indulging indirectly the simplification of a grave 
		problem as seen by those people ?&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Arial">As I mentioned 
		above you are in the center of the present crisis and critical phase, 
		because according to the constitution you are due to be the chief 
		adviser of the caretaker government after the expiry of the government 
		led by Begum Khaleda. The 4-party alliance wants you to occupy that 
		seat. On the other hand the AL and its allies do not want see you on the 
		seat of the chief adviser. Because, to them you are not at all an 
		acceptable person for that chair. For this reason they have lunched a 
		movement to press for the demands of reformation of caretaker government 
		after formulating a mechanism how to ensure the formation of a true 
		non-party neutral caretaker government and thereby making the path of 
		holding a free and fair election. Even yesterday, Mr. Jalil, general 
		secretary of AL, one of the negotiators spelt out clearly and loudly 
		that if after making the dialogue a failure and ignoring the demands of 
		the oppositions if you are made chief adviser, they will not accept it. 
		What they will do in the event of breaking down the negotiation has also 
		been said clearly and loudly. (Sangbad, 22 October). &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Arial">Pretty long 
		time before i.e. at the time when the retiring age of judges of the apex

		government, the Awami League raised a loud objection that you are not an 
		acceptable person as the head of the caretaker government. They also

		<span style="font-family: Arial">No body wants that a gentleman like you 
		with good reputation as a justice should be put in such an uncomfortable 
		situation, that too when is not your creation. &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Respected justice, </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Whether allegations lodged against you 
		were true or false is not the issue before the nation, the reality is 
		that to some influential political parties belonging to opposition and 
		their large number of followers you are not a non-party man, and for 
		this reason they do not expect neutrality from the caretaker government 
		led by you, rather they consider your government would be just an 
		extension of the BNP government. The fear and their expressed anxiety 
		might be very well largely ill founded and exaggeration.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Arial">You might very 
		well think that through your actions their fear and anxiety would be 
		proved wrong. But justice Hasan, the world is not that simple. I have 
		not brought in the reference of the opinions of the common mass 
		intentionally, but they surely think that during this critical time you 
		will play a role of a pathfinder and guide to remove the national 
		crisis.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Arial">I can very 
		well understand your position, but Justice Hasan, many people has to 
		rise above at the time of need. You are that man in this historic moment 
		rising above the limit of individual Hasan could play an important 
		historical role. What role you would take – it is entirely your 
		decision. It is rumored that you have already decided not to accept the 
		position of the chief adviser, but you are keeping yourself mum at the 
		instruction of the BNP high command. This alleged news is not at all 
		praise worthy on your part. In the mean while another respected retired 
		justice has given you a little advice that `if he were you, he would 
		have not accepted the post of the chief adviser’ of the caretaker 
		government. The message is quite clear.&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Arial">As an 
		individual this humble self also precisely wants to transmit the same 
		message to you for the greater interest of the country, people and the 
		nation. Can you, raising much above the individual limit, give a public 
		announcement to the effect, “I shall not accept the post of the chief 
		adviser” of the ensuing caretaker government- unhesitatingly, clearly 
		and very loudly. And send an immediate message to the President 
		conveying your intention of declining to become the chief adviser so 
		that President can plan well ahead with relative ease. Justice Hasan, 
		would you rise to the occasion ? Historical moment comes only once in 
		one’s lifetime. The time is running out very rapidly. &nbsp;</font></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">Your decisive step will have a 
		catalytic action in removing the present crisis and may bring in a 
		positive end of the dialogue. The nation will remain grateful to you.
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;Please excuse me for writing such an 
		open letter- from an insignificant man like me to a great man like you.
