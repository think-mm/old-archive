	<h3><span lang="EN-US">Statement of the jail-killing incident&nbsp;</span></h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
		<span lang="EN-US">On 3<sup>rd</sup> November 1975 early morning of 3 
		a.m. I received a telephone call of Major Rashid from Bangabhaban 
		(President’s House). He enquired from me if there were any trouble 
		inside the central jail. I informed him that at this very moment the 
		exact situation was not known to me. He informed me that a group of 
		persons in uniform might go to the central jail to take away some 
		prisoners out of the jail forcibly; the major instructed me to alert the 
		jail security guards, and immediately proceed to jail gate. I almost 
		immediately contacted the central Warder in Charge of the jail gate to 
		take the message to the jailer so that proper security arrangement could 
		be strengthened. After 3-4 minutes I received another phone call from 
		Bnagabhaban from yet another army officer who wanted to know if I had 
		already cautioned the jail guards. When I answered in the affirmative, 
		he instructed me to go to the jail gate to see for myself the security 
		arrangement taken. I then ranged to the DIG prison informing him the 
		latest development and asked him to come to the central jail 
		immediately. I also proceeded to the central jail gate without further 
		delay where I found the jailor. I asked him to alert the security system 
		of the jail gate. In the mean while the DIG prison also arrived there. I 
		once again informed about the message I received from Bnagabhaban. Just 
		at that moment we received another phone call from Major Rashid who 
		informed me that within a short while one Capt. Moslem would arrive at 
		the jail gate. He told me that the captain would tell me something. He 
		further instructed me to take the captain inside the jail office and 
		then Messrs 1. Tajuddin Ahmed, 2. Mansur Ali, 3. Syed Nazrul Islam, 4. 
		Quamruzzaman be produced before him. At this stage I wanted to talk to 
		the President directly and the phone was handed over to him (the 
		president). Before I opened my mouth the President (Kh. Mustaq Ahmed) 
		wanted to know if I had clearly understood the instruction of Major 
		Rashid. When I said ‘yes’, he ordered me to carry out the instruction. 
		Within a few minutes a team of 4 soldiers led by Capt. Moslem dressed in 
		black robes arrived at the jail gate. After entering the office of the 
		DIG prison he ordered us to take him and his companions to those persons 
		mentioned above. I told him that as per instruction of Bangabhaban he 
		(the captain) to tell me something. In answer to it he said that he 
		would shoot them (the 4 leaders). We became simply bewildered at his 
		words. Myself and DIG prison tried to get in touch with the president 
		over phone but without any success. At this moment another phone call 
		came to the jailor’s number. As I received the phone, Major Rashid 
		enquired if Capt. Moslem arrived there. I said ‘yes’ and told him that I 
		was at a loss to understand what was happening here. Major Rashid then 
		asked me to talk to the president. I told the president the intention of 
		the captain and his team to kill the 4 prisoners. The president replied 
		that what the captain wanted to do let it be done. At this we got very 
		much excited. The captain at the gunpoint ordered me, DIG prison, jailor 
		and other jail officers present there to take him to the place where the 
		above-mentioned captives were kept. The captain and his accomplices were 
		then behaving very madly, and we had no other way to disobey their 
		order. They ordered us to separate those prisoners from others and put 
		them inside another room. The order was carried out. There the jailor 
		identified them. The captain and his accompanying soldiers opened fire 
		at the prisoners and killed them. After some time another team of 
		soldiers led by Nayek A Ali came to the central jail to confirm whether 
		victims were dead. They straight went to the ward and bayonet charged 
		the bodies of the victims lying there. </span></font></p>
