  is a <st1:place>

  die heart and out &amp; out communal, no place of fundamentalism, though her
  government allies Jammat &amp; other Islamic partners openly preach and
  practice fundamentalism, no place of Afghanistan brand talebanism— though
  her present colleagues in 4-party alliance belonging to Islamic band-wagon did
  cry and still crying for establishment talebanism form of Islamic State in BD.
  Remember their full throated war cry during USA led invasion against Taleban
  government of Afghan following 9/11 event, ‘<i><span style="color:blue">Amra
  holam taleban, Bangla habe taleban</span></i>’ (We are talebans, we will
  make Bangladesh a taleban state). May we ask the great lady with colored
  glass, beautifully made hair style, robed with colourful semi-transparent
  chiffon sari while distributing alms (in the name of relief) to poorly dressed
  distressed &amp; flood stricken men &amp; women, where those disciples of
  Osmana bin Laden and followers of Talebanism brand of Islam gone madam?<o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Our
  PM just yesterday once again uttered publicly in a meeting held at <st1:City>
  <st1:place>
  Raipur</st1:place>
  </st1:City>
  in Daudkandi upazila on the occasion of flood relief distribution ceremony
  (yes I call it ceremony), “There are some parities that are deeply engaged
  in conspiring against the country. Some are propagating that <st1:country-region>
  <st1:place>
  Bangladesh</st1:place>
  </st1:country-region>
  has turned to an ineffective state, sometimes it is being alleged that <st1:country-region>
  <st1:place>
  Bangladesh</st1:place>
  </st1:country-region>
  have Talebans and Al Quiedas. These are all propagandas- there are no traces
  of Al Quieda nor Talebans in the country.” She further alleged, ‘these
  interested circles are out to disrupt country’s economy with an ulterior
  motive to make it weak” The PM opined that <st1:country-region>
  <st1:place>
  Bangladesh</st1:place>
  </st1:country-region>
  is never or would be a weak state—it is a successful state. In what way our
  state is successful, one can surely make a pointed question to her and her
  4-party alliance government. One may also raise question ‘Have your Islamic
  partners in the government, or your fundamentalist supporters outside the
  government gave up the ideals of establishing Islamic Republic in Taleban
  model or Moududi model ?. Have they adopted new doctrine of BNP brand
  democracy which has established ‘Moderate Moslem democratic System’ in BD
  giving up their old faith of Talebanism or Jamtesim ? I wonder ! Oh dear PM,
  you must be living in a ‘fool’s paradise’. How could our PM explain the
  existence of Bangla Bhai and his armed bahini conducted their terrorist
  activities in the very nose of the administration and police, defiance of
  PM’s order of the arrest by the highest law &amp; order agencies including
  the ministry of home affairs, the contradictory statements on the part of the
  police administration saying that Bangla Bahi ‘is acting to help the police
  in combating the Janajudhawallas’ on the other hand highest police authority
  denied the very existence of such person as Bangla bhai and his organization
  ‘Jagrata Bangladesh’. On the one hand PM issued order to arrest Bangla
  bhai, her important cabinet colleague Jamati minister Moulana Nizami declared
  that Bangla bhai is a fictitious character, in reality he does not exist.
  Since then our PM kept mum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">In
  public platforms PM says ‘there is no Talebans or Al-Quiedas’, but a
  physics teacher of Jahangirnagar University instead of teaching physics for
  which he is being paid by the university authority is teaching philosophy of
  talebanism. Instead of asking his women students to uncover the mystery of
  nature through laws of physics, he is ordering his women students to covering
  their bodies with ‘borqhahs’. In order to introduce Talebani culture he
  asked his Hindu students to read ‘Kalema’ and ‘Qoran’. It is a direct
  approach to ask them to accept Islam giving up their traditional religion. Who
  has given him that authority to preach Islam and teach Islamic principle
  within the classroom of physics wherein laws of physics should be taught
  instead. Instead assigning home task on a physical problem he asked his
  students to write an essay on qualities of Allah. This is simply ridiculous!
  It also rises question ‘does he know physics at all’? We think not. We
  learnt that he took more than eight years to take a higher degree in Physics
  from a foreign university. Even Islamic Physicist Dr. Shamsher Ali did not
  dare to do such silly things in the classroom. The gentleman concerned
  surpassed all ‘norm’s, a physics term well acquainted by every students of
  physics.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">Thank
  god, at least a good sense prevailed on the part of the Academic committee of
  Physics department, <st1:place>
  <st1:PlaceName>
  Jahangirnagar</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType>
  University</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  that decided to relieve the concerned teacher, Assistant Professor (sic!)
  Obaidur Rahman from all teaching duties till a final decision is taken by the
  higher authority of the university. The committee opined that non-academic
  activities relating to religion within the classroom has vitiated the academic
  environment of the department, created resentment among the students, and
  brought a bad name to the department. The university authority returned to its
  senses at last, as it had constituted a 5men inquiry committee with Pro-VC
  Enamul Haque to probe into the matter. Other members are deans of four
  faculties. The committee is to submit a report within <st1:date Year="2004"
Day="7" Month="10">
  7<sup>th</sup> October 2004</st1:date>
  . Different progressive students’ organizations since then almost every day
  were holding protest rallies impressing upon the university authority to take
  appropriate against the talebani teacher. It is learnt that after the
  departmental academic committee’s decision the teacher said that he now
  ‘understands’ his ‘mistakes’, but at the same time denied that he used
  to address Hindu students and employees with ‘Arabic names’! ‘Ekey bale,
  thelar naam babajee’.</p>
