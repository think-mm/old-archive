	<span lang="EN-US">The tragic day was 3<sup>rd</sup> November. On this day 
	29 years ago four national leaders namely Tajuddin Ahmed, First Prime 
	Minister of People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Vice President of the republic 
	Sayed Nazrul Islam, Finance Minister Capt. Mansur Ali, and AHM Quamruzzama, 
	Minister of Interior affairs, relief and rehabilitation were gun downed by 
	one Naik Risalder Mahiuddin led killer team sent by Rashid with the approval 
	of Kh. Mushtaque Ahmed, the majors-installed puppet president of the 
	country. Awami League &amp; its front organizations, and some secular cultural 
	bodies observed the day. Outside to this fold no organization, small or big 
	observed the day or remember their contribution in our war of liberation. We 
	have forgotten those great names who led us to victory in our liberation 
	war. The Government of Khaleda-Nizami never even mentioned these names not 
	to hold any state function in their honour. To them only exists General Zia. 
	Why a people’s government would be so mean. How pathetically the country is 
	divided even at this level. We remember Khaled Musharaff, our most gallant 
	freedom fighter as traitor, Indian agent &amp; pro-Awami man (sic) forgetting 
	his contribution in our liberation war. We forgot the contribution of Gen 
	Manzoor as freedom fighter, only remembering him as conspirator of killing 
	of Gen Zia in Chittagong plot. We forgot Col Taher for his gallant fight in 
	Chilmari, Kamalpur battlefields where he lost one leg, but we killed him 
	because he acted against the army bureaucracy and conservative military 
	school of thought, which went against the interest of Gen Zia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

	From 3<sup>rd</sup> November to 6<sup>th</sup> November it was a transition 
	and critical period. As we know, following the great tragedy of August 15 
	(1975) Farukh-Rashid-Dalim gang took control of Bangabhavan, where they put 
	Kh. Mustaque Ahmed as a puppet Rastrapati of the People’s Republic of 
	Bangladesh. Mustaq termed these killers as ‘<i>Surya Santan</i>’ (sons of 
	Sun). The killers and soldiers under their command, especially the tank 
	regiment did not return to barrack after even months; instead, they 
	stationed themselves in and around Bangabhaban. The trio all the time 
	remained in the president’s palace surrounding the crooked so-called 
	president Mushtaque. These created great resentment amongst the ordinary 
	soldiers and senior officers. Significantly, General Osmani, the commander 
	in chief of Bangladesh liberation army, and Khalilur Rahman, the then 
	director general of BDR extended all out support to Mustaque and then played 
	significant roles during those crucial days in saving his life. It is still 
	a mystery to me why the elder general, who was then appointed as the advisor 
	of defence affairs to the President, acted in a strange way. Major General 
	Khalilur Rahman was made chief of defence staff. Both were above the rank of 
	chief of staff. The then army chief Major General Shafiullah was forcibly 
	sent to retirement on 24<sup>th</sup> August, 1975. Major General Ziaur 
	Rahman was appointed chief of staff and in his place. But Zia failed to 
	restore the chain of commands in the army. As is known today, the senior 
	army officials, especially who fought so gallantly to liberate our country 
	during war of liberation, asked Zia to take serious steps to restore 
	discipline in the army. They also insisted to take disciplinary action as 
	envisaged in army rules against the killers of Bangabandhu who after the 
	event of August ’75 were running the country defying all constitutional and 
	institutional authorities including the army. The situation had become 
	simply intolerable to these army officials beyond limit. So they decided to 
	act, as the army chief failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></h5>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext">An ill planned 
	military coup under the leadership of Major General, then Brigadier, Khaled 
	Musharraf took place on 2<sup>nd</sup> November night. The immediate aim of 
	the coup was to (a) restore chain of command in the military, (b) eject 
	illegally occupier of the chair of the Rashtrapati, and (3) set up a 
	government as permitted by the constitution. The sentiment of pro-liberation 
	army officials who did not approve of Farukh-Rashid gong’s occupying state 
	power illegally in the name of military coup can be typically expressed in 
	the language of Brigadier Shafayat Jamil (addressing to Farukh and Rashid 
	who were present in a meeting of the army high command following a few days 
	after the incident) as: “</span><i><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;color:navy">You 
	are all liars, mutineers and deserters. You are all murderers. Tell your 
	Mustaque that he is a usurper and conspirator. He is not my president. In my 
	first opportunity I shall dislodge him and you all will be tried for your 
	crimes.</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;color:windowtext">” 
	From August to November till they were evicted from President’s palace, the 
	killer gong practically ran a parallel army administration with the help of 
	Mushtaque, Khalilur Rahman and the general Osmany. Zia had practically no 
	power – he submitted to their ill wishes. </span></font></span></h5>

	The situation prevailed at that time is as follows. Farukh-Rashid duo trio 
	used to stay in the President’s palace with a dozen of tanks inside the 
	Bangabhaban. 12 tanks were placed in Ramna race course maidan, and 10 tanks 
	were kept within the cantonment in ever combat position. This means that 
	tank regiment and the artillery units were outside the army chain of 
	command. These units were entirely under the control of Farukh and Rashid; 
	Zia, Khalilur Rahman or Osmany had no control over these units. Other trio 
	Dalim, Nur, Sharuiar and &amp; gong used to stay inside the Bangladesh Radio 
	buildings with some soldiers under their command. </span></font></h5>

	The d-day was set on 2<sup>nd</sup> November. 46<sup>th</sup> Brigade under 
	the command of Brigadier Shafayat Jamil swiftly moved into action. They 
	moved into Bangabhavan, took control of Bangladesh Radio; its transmission 
	was suspended, and took position in other strategic positions to make 
	ineffective of possible tank actions. On the 3<sup>rd</sup> November morning 
	the air force MiG Fighter Jets flew over Bnagabhaban sky in a threatening 
	posture. General Zia was made ineffective and isolated from the killer-gong 
	by a company of first Bengal led by Captain Hafizullah in the early morning 
	of 3<sup>rd</sup> November. His telephone line was apparently snapped 
	without knowing that a line in the bedroom was still operative. Osmany moved 
	to Bangabhavan after receiving a desperate Rashid-SOS in the morning of 
	November 3, who recalled the situation in this fashion when he tried to get 
	hold of Zia over phone: “His wife picked up the telephone and, said, ‘Zia 
	can’t come to the telephone … there is some difficulty.’ When I insisted on 
	talking to him, she told me in a hushed sort of voice that there were some 
	men in the hall with him and he couldn’t come to the phone. I realized then 
	that Zia was under some sort of restrain.” After some ding dong negotiation 
	with Mushtaque and the negotiating team of Khaled Musharraf Farukh-Rashid 
	gong agreed to surrender and leave the country. But by this time Kh. 
	Mushtaque had completed his mission of jail killing. How this was brutally 
	executed by Kh. Mushtaque with the aids of Rashid and other killers – I have 
	described in a series of articles posted in Mukto-mona forum recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<span lang="EN-US">Before the deportation of Frarukh-Rashid gong, when

	Ali once for all. All now knows what the hated trio did in the morning of 
	3rd November when the ‘counter coup’ of Khaled Musharraf was set on. The 
	previously ‘selected combat team’ led by Naik Risaldar Musleuddin sent to 
	the jail with strict instruction to finish off four national leaders. The 
	killer team of Musleuddin, sent by Mushtaque-Farukh-Rashid-Dalim gong, 
	meticulously carried out the order inside the Dhaka Central jail in a room, 
	where the ill-fated leaders were dragged in for execution. The facts 
	relating to jail killing was now well documented as would be obvious from my 
	previous postings wherein a series of depositions made by the jail 
	authorities was presented, as well as from the tape recordings of statements 
	of various officials of the jail including the then IG prisoner made by late

	at the order of General Khaled Musharraf in the evening of 4<sup>th</sup>

	<span lang="EN-US">The coup leaders at this point took too long a time to 
	inform the nation what their plan was. The radio and TV remained silent for 
	complete 2-days. As a result, all sorts of gossips spread throughout Dhaka. 
	All the cantonments outside Dhaka became restless and soldiers were 
	contemplating to move towards Dhaka. The anti counter coup forces of other 
	nature utilized the crucial two days. Although Farukh-Rashid was removed 
	from the scene, and Mustaque was made ineffective, the coup leaders suffered 
	from indecision. They ultimately forced Mushtaque to sign proclaiming two 
	presidential orders: (1) in the event of falling vacant of the office of the 
	Rastrapati, the chief justice of the supreme court would become the 
	Rastrapati, and (2) Brigadier Khaled Musharraf with the promotion to the 
	rank of Major General would replace General Zia as next chief of army staff. 
	Mustaque was then forced to resign. He was then interned in the presidential 
	suit in Bangabhaban. The day of 5<sup>th</sup> November passed with drafting 
	of would be presidential address to the nation. Justice Sayem, chief justice 
	of newly created Bangladesh Supreme court at the first instance refused to 
	become part of the plan, but finally gave in to constant insistence of the 
	coup leaders. At last the silence was broken. Justice Abusadat Mohammad 
	Sayem addressed the nation over radio and TV in the evening of 6<sup>th</sup> 
	November. In his address the new President made clear that his government 
	was neutral, non-party and interim, and committed to independent but neutral 
	foreign policy with ‘unqualified support’ for the Islamic world. He 
	dissolved the parliament promising a fresh election within six months. The 
	most significant part of his address was that he cleared the army from 
	killing the founder of Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He 
	assured the nation that a proper investigation of Bangabandhu killing and 
	jail killing would be done, and culprits would be punished according to law. 
	In many ways Sayem’s address was remarkable in a sense that it gave an 
	immense of dignity to Khaled-Shafayet led coup. </span></font></p>

	<span lang="EN-US">The night passed quietly for General Khaled Musharraf and 
	his two associates. They had breakfast in the morning (7<sup>th</sup> 
	November, 1975). Then came the dreadful moment. Some sepoys belonging to the 
	Bengal Lancers and 2 Field Artillery came over urging the jawans of 10<sup>th</sup> 
	Bengal to join hands with the mutineers. The soldiers however remained 
	unmoved and there is no record that 10<sup>th</sup> Bengal joined the 
	mutiny. But this created some confusion and panic among the junior officers 
	hearing the dreadful slogan ‘Officer der rakta chai’. Khaled, Huda and 
	Haider were then in the office of the CO. Around 11 a.m. two company 
	commanders named Captain Asad and Captain Jalil all on a sudden entered the 
	room and gunned down all three patriotic gallant freedom fighters. This is 
	simply a cold-blooded murder. A most ghastly day in our history, and most 
	unforgettable incident. Why did they do it? Is it because they developed 
	fear complex or were they influenced by Col Taher’s message of revolution ? 
	We would never know. But surely they committed most heinous crime in our 
	history and they should be answerable to the future generation if not to 
	justice. </span></font></p>

	open allegiance to Mushtaque regime was no secret, who felt insecure after

	soldiers mentioned above, the members of the Ganabahini (People’s Army), an

	overthrow the present occupant of the state power. They raised the terrible

	<span lang="EN-US">The mutiny of sepoys, led by Col Taher erupted just after 
	midnight of 6<sup>th</sup> November. The night was terrible and difficult to 
	forget. I was then at DU residential quarters, and heard whole night full 
	throated slogans like- <i>Bangladesh Zindabad</i>, <i>Sepai Biplab Zindabad, 
	Gen Zia Zindabad, Col Taher Zindabad, Naraye Takbir Allah ho Akbar etc.</i>, 
	gun-fire shots, sounds of machine guns &amp; fire-cracking sounds from distance 
	north, most probably from the cantonment. The last slogan is always a 
	terrifying one to me, which I had been hearing since my boyhood during 
	Pakistan movement and during communal riots. On the following morning the 
	mad soldiers spread all over the city, especially in the area of DU campus, 
	Motijheel commercial area and Purana Paltan on tanks and trucks firing gun 
	shots towards the sky. Many students including girls, evidently pro JSD, and 
	some ordinary men were found to ride over the tanks. But most of the people 
	on the streets were on lookers with curiosity and fear. Small processions 
	with pro mutiny elements parading the streets with various slogans- some 
	were chanting ‘<i>General Zia Zindabad, Sepai Janata Bhai Bhai</i> carrying 
	Zia’s portrait; some found chanting ‘<i>Col Taher Zindabad, Long live 
	Revolution, Bangladesh Zindabad</i>’, even processions supporting evicted 
	president Kh. Mushtaque Ahmed and carrying his garlanded picture found 
	parading the streets with full throated slogans- <i>Bangladesh Zindabad, Kh. 
	Mushtaque Ahmed Zindabad, Naraye Taqbir Allah Hu Akbar</i>. It must be 
	admitted that during those days following the failure of Khaled Musharraf’s 
	ill planed coup, Zia emerged as hero of the hour. It is no denying of the 
	fact that he was then most popular military personality in the cantonment. 
	This is obvious as the soldiers were found killing their own officers and 
	hunting theme quarter to quarter not only inside the cantonment but in the 
	city as well, with the slogan Gen. Zia Zindabad. At about 6 a.m. morning a 
	tape-recorded address of General Zia was broadcast through radio Bangladesh. 
	Although Col Taher wanted him to take to Radio station, but sepoys of 2<sup>nd</sup> 
	artillery &amp; some officers present there prevented the move on ‘security 
	reason’, instead a recording unit was summoned. The speech was very brief in 
	which he announced that he had taken over the office of the Chief Martial 
	Administrator temporarily at the request of the armed forces in the 
	prevailing situation of the country. He urged upon the soldiers to return to 
	the barracks asked them to restrain from killing of soldiers and other 
	peoples whom they thought anti mutiny elements- civilians or military. He 
	also called for a greater unity and asked all to return to work immediately. 
	In the meanwhile supporters of Kh. Musgtaque took him to the Radio station 
	for broadcast. But unfortunately for him at that instant Col. Taher’s people 
	were controlling the station. They did not permit him to make any statement 
	unless Taher gave approval. Taher then arrived at the station later and 
	drove him out with his followers. However Abu Taher’s attempt to bring Zia 
	again to Radio station with a view to make statement in line with JSD’ view 
	of revolution again failed. Col Taher perhaps did not understand the real 
	character of Zia- he was basically an opportunist man, hesitant but cruel, 
	ambitious, religious and proponent of Muslim and Islamic ideology. He had 
	never been a revolutionary leader- this was not in his nature. Col Taher 
	made a desperate attempt to bring Zia in a meeting of thousands of 
	mutineer-soldiers assembled at the racecourse maidan, but he failed. Failed 
	he to get approval of his party’s new proclamation from Zia’s mouth in 
	presence of thousands of soldiers. Thus the dream of JSD and Taher as 
	envisaged in the Proclamation that reads, “<i><span style="color:maroon">Our 
	Revolution is not for changing the leadership only. This revolution is only 
	for the interest of the poor and depriving class. We have accepted you (Zia) 
	as our leader in this revolution. For this reason you are to express very 
	clearly that you are the leader of that class. And for that you have to 
	change the structure of the armed forces. … From today onwards the armed 
	forces of the country will build themselves as the protector of the interest 
	of the poor class</span></i>”, withered away in fiasco.</span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span lang="EN-US">But his attempt failed miserably. The more conservative 
	and conventional elements of the army held the day. Since then Col Taher’s 
	grip over Zia was slipping away and the initial control of JSD and its front 
	organizations. The dream of Col Taher and JSD to occupy state power trough 
	the so-called Sepoy_Janta Revolution within a few days evaporated away, 
	instead they found themselves in the Dhaka Central jail. Col Taher was 
	arrested probably on 24<sup>th</sup> November from an Assistant House 
	tutor’s quarter, the resident of a Physics lecturer, who happened to be one 
	of my students where he was hiding since his control over Zia and the 
	Cantonment slipped away. Thus brought the end of so-called revolution as 
	conceived by one of our great freedom fighters Col Abu Taher, BU.</span></font></p>
