  <p class="MsoBodyText">The inevitable end came in the early hours (~ 2- 30 
  a.m.) of Friday, August 6, 2004, when Journalist Santosh Gupta breathed his 
  last. This brings an end of a colourful life of a journalist that lasted over 
  five decades. He was admitted to BARDEM hospital following heavy brain 
  hemorrhage on August 1 following which he went to deep comma from where he 
  never recovered for a moment. Three days later he was declared clinically dead 
  by the leading neuro-physicians attending him, although his heart and lung 
  functions kept alive artificially with a hope against hope, a miracle to 
  happen. On Early morning of Friday his condition severely deteriorated, and 
  the doctors with the consent of his relatives removed the life supporting 
  aids. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Shri Santosh Gupta, perhaps the most elderly but active 
  journalist of the country, popularly known as columnist ‘Anirudha’ of the 
  daily Sangbad passed away peacefully almost immediately after. To us, among 
  his relatively junior friend circles, he was beloved called as ‘Santosh da’. 
  Even in his life time he almost became an legendary figure and earned an all 
  time place among the great journalists produced in Bangladesh like- Zahur 
  Hosain Choudhury, Manik Mian, Ranesh Das Gupta, Shahidullah Kaiser and poet 
  Hasan Hafizur Rahman. After the demise of those elites, Santosh da became a 
  lone figure in the world of Bangladesh journalism who could inspire our 
  younger journalists as an example what could be termed as honest journalist.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  His columns written under the pen name of ‘Anirudha’ not only dealt with 
  political matters, but with history and culture of our society and nation. He 
  was not only dedicated and honest but also courageous, a rare qualification 
  one finds in the world of journalism these days. Perhaps uncompromising is the 
  right word we associate with his name. An un assuming in character, mild in 
  nature- falsely gave an impression of timidity, Santosh da never feared to 
  express what he though to be right. He had phenomenological memory of history 
  and world events with precise dates and background. His departure, even in 
  matured age is a great loss to the nation. </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  On personal level I have a great love and respect for him. On many seminars, 
  discussion meetings we sat together- he was not a very eloquent speaker in 
  conventional sense- but his arguments and analytical brain far out weighed the 
  so called eloquence or oratory. He begins softly, takes time to make his 
  points heard &amp; felt among the audience and then almost invariably makes deep 
  impression even one might not agree with his final inference. He was a most 
  lovable person I came across my life. </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  His love for Bangladesh or one may say for a land ‘once East Pakistan’ raised 
  eyebrows of many. Could you imagine after partition of 1947 of India on the 
  basis of Jinnah’s communal ideology, Santosh da opted for Pakistan being a 
  so-called Hindu. He was a police officer during partition in 1947, and was a 
  confidential assistant (CA) in IG prison in East Pakistan when he arrived in 
  Dhaka. Unimaginable matter- Santosh da police officer! His option for East 
  Pakistan was not obviously love for Jinnah’s Islamic ideological Pakistan but 
  for his birth land, East Bengal (Purbo Bangla), then so called. </p>

  Shri Gupta, son of a Shri Jogesh Gupta and mother Kiran Bala Gupta was born in 
  a remote village named Runsi, in the then Bakhertganj district (now in the 
  district of Jhalakathi) in the year 1925. He matriculated in 1941 from 
  Jhalakathi P. K. Institute. After completion of his school education he 
  graduated from City College, Calcutta now Moulana Azad College. He joined the 
  IG prison office as a junior officer after successfully passing Indian Public 
  Service Commission in 1945 or so. If he wished and stayed back in Calcutta he 
  might have ended as a successful big police officer of India. But that was not 
  to be his fate. Instead he chose a life trajectory that made him a famous 
  journalist of the subcontinent. </p>

  When he was taken to Dhaka central jail in 1949, a hunger strike was going on 
  to press a charter of demands, which continued for 58 days. The newly arrived 
  prisoners including Santosh da who was then a young man of 24 years 
  immediately joined in the strike. It may be recalled that on 20<sup>th</sup> 
  day of hunger strike Shiben Roy of Kusthia, a veteran labour leader of textile 
  industries succumbed to death while he was forcibly being fed. He was released 
  from jail after more than three years. He was again arrested in 1954 and came 
  out of the jail after over a year. He was once again taken to prison for his 
  communist leanings, which was then treated as seditious activity against 
  Pakistan, following Martial Law imposed by Sepoy General Ayub Khan in 1958 
  killing the democratic institutions from which Pakistan never was back to 
  democracy even today. He came out of the jail in 1962 after four years. He 
  started journalist career in 1957 as an assistant editor of Sangbad and came 
  back to Sangbad in 1962 after the release. He intermittently worked in daily 
  Azad in the first phase in 1964-65, and then in second phase from in 1967 to 
  25<sup>th</sup> March of 1971 when Pakistani army cracked down on Awami league 
  leaders including its leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, undisputed 
  leader of the Bengali nation at that time, and on the thousands of sleeping 
  population Dhaka. After liberation he resumed his work in Azad only to return 
  to Sangbad after only a few months, never to leave it again. Sangbad became 
  his second home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

  He become inclined to left politics led by then Communist Party of India (CPI) 
  from his college life. His communist association led to the arrest of himself, 
  his mother, Sardar Fazlul Karim, Abdul Bar, Ranu Chaterjee, Jnan Chakravorty, 
  Manu Mian (a peasant leader) and some other communist workers in 1949 on the 
  day of Christmas day when a secret police team raided his house at night. It 
  was believed they were in a secret meeting in the house of Santosh da, then a 
  CA of IG prisoner Mr. Amir Hosain. It is now known of the story (which we 
  heard from Santosh da many a times) that on the following morning Mr. Hosain 
  went to see the arrestees in the Dhaka central jail, when he heard that his 
  timid looking soft spoken CA was so deeply involved in communist movement. 
  This is probably called in Bengali proverb ‘<i>Bagher ghare ghoger basa</i>’ 
  (a weakling settling in the lair of its deadly enemy). </p>

  This association with communist movement he continued till the communist 
  Soviet Russia collapsed like a card of house. This historic event like, to 
  many of us, came as a rude shock wave to him. This not only bewildered him, 
  but also turned him in his latter writings apparently an anti communist. Many 
  of his later columns dedicated to heart-felt searching for what went wrong in 
  Soviet Communism or in fact in world communist movement with special reference 
  to dissolution of CBP. His writings not only revealed his inner feelings of 
  pains and hurt, but also exposed his attempts to unveil the cause of failures 
  of the communist movement through the world. His bitter and critical writings, 
  speeches and columns invited even personal attacks from the ultra left 
  communist theoreticians spearheaded by Badruddin Umar, and underground 
  terrorist-anarchists of Purbo Bangla Communist party, Naxalites, 
  Janajudhawallas etc. Santosh da never compromised or endorsed with <i>gala 
  kata rajniti</i> (cut throat policy) of ultra left communists even in the hey 
  days of Naxalite movement under Charu Majumdar, nor he was inspired by the 
  slogan of Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist-Maoist variants of communist parties 
  ‘Chairman is our Chairman’. The division of communist movement into many 
  campuses in Indian subcontinent during sixties shocked him. But like us the 
  silent spectators but supporters of world communism, who once believed in 
  ‘unity of the communists and workers of the world’, Santosh da also became 
  frustrated about the whole communist movement. Since then Santosh da gradually 
  drifted away from active communist movement, but concentrating himself mainly 
  in his writings dealing with problems relating to liberal democracy coupled 
  with secularism and non communal political and social culture with special 
  reference to Bangladesh context, but all the time retaining a soft corner for 
  the spectrum of leftists’ philosophy in general. His book entitled <i>
  Samajtantret Anya Itihas</i> (Another History of Socialism) is the out come of 
  his thought of searching for the cause of the apparent failure of world 
  communism and our local variants. Being a communist He had immense love and 
  respect for Bangabandhu although he was a critic of many of Bangabandhu’s 
  policies in running state affairs during his lifetime. But he had never 
  released venoms of hatred or personal grudge against Bangabandhu following his 
  brutal murder at the hand of a few pro-pakistani elements in Bangladesh army. 
  On the contrary he defended him for 4-basic ideologies that he incorporated in 
  Bangladesh constitution, and for his great contribution in building the 
  concept of Bengali nationalism in this part of the world, and largely 
  responsible for materializing it through his columns after columns in most 
  difficult period of our history. He treated Bangabandhu really as the real 
  architect of Bangladesh, call him father of the nation or not it matters 
  little to the great man of the history. He time and again wrote critical 
  articles showing the limitations, shortcomings and shortsightedness of the 
  present Awami league leadership for its compromising attitude to 4 basic 
  principles. According to Santosh da the life of Awami League is and has been 
  always the 4 basic principles incorporated in 1972 constitution. Out of 
  frustration of failure of communism Santosh da used to say on many occasions 
  posing a question, ‘Where did we go wrong ? Were all our past activities 
  childish and full of errors ?’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

  Let me pay my deep respect and tribute by remembering him as one of great 
  well-wishers. I knew him since mid sixties after I came back from England, yes 
  for more than forty years. I have always been admirer of his writings and 
  speeches. We had many sweet personal memories. Following his serious illness 
  in which he had to be set in a pace maker, when I went to see him in Sangbad 
  office after his recovery- we had hours of talk and gossip with not less than 
  ten cups of raw tea. Santosh da was a heavy smoker- I have never seen him 
  without a smoking stick. But on that day he did not smoke. When I pointed out 
  how the miracle could happen, he gave a childlike smile, and said. ‘I really 
  miss it.’ Needless to say, I warned him not to resume it at any cost, ‘even at 
  the cost of your beautiful writings.’ I added further, ‘We can sustain the 
  loss of your writings, but not the Santosh da as a man, as a humanist, as a 
  conscience of intellectual communities!’ When I narrated him my own experience 
  how the lakhs and lakhs of minorities belonging to different minority 
  communities were being oppressed at the hands of the goondas let loose by the 
  parties in power in cooperation with local administration following the 
  general election he admired our effort. But cautioned me as his affectionate 
  ones not to take unnecessary risk. He wished that he could accompany me to 
  remote areas of the country, but for his physical constraints. </p>

  I still remember when I presented a copy of my work, a monograph dealing with 
  origin and development of Bengali people from earlier days based on 
  anthropological as well as sociological data, entitled ‘<i>Adi Bangali : 
  Nritwattik o Samajtattik Bislesan</i>’ he wrote a critical review in his 
  column with profuse praise to my utter surprise. I neither did nor request to 
  do so- he did his own out of affection, I am sure. But he did not fail to 
  point out the weak points of the book, which need more elaboration. One day he 
  rang me if I could give him another copy as he had lost it, and needed it 
  right at that moment for his writings. Fortunately I had a spare one. I did 
  not know that Santosh da had deep interest in science and its history. More 
  than a two decades back I was serializing a translation of Bhaskaracharyya’s 
  Leelavati in Bengali from original Sanskrit in Bangla Academy Science Patrika. 
  For various reasons I had to discontinue it after I published 5-6 chapters. On 
  some occasion we met in a seminar. He asked me why I had stopped translating 
  Leelavati. Little did I have any idea that a journalist was following my 
  science writings! I felt elevated. He made a request to resume it, but in 
  spite of my earnest desire I am yet to resume it. Another instance of his 
  interest in scientific development in our country- he once praised Dr. Ali 
  Ashgar, a leading figure in magnetic research in our country for Ashgar’s 
  contribution in magnetic research. I was simply charmed – and asked him where 
  did you get this information. He did not reply, only gave a smile- added 
  one-day I would write also about your works and other of other scientists of 
  the country. One day he rang me from Sangabad office just to praise a science 
  writing of mine on the history of development of modern science in Bangladesh 
  that appeared in Sangbad. He knew how to encourage a smaller people like me. A 
  great man indeed. Let me end my write up quoting from one of his great friend 
  and one time comrade, Sardar Fazlul Karim: <i>Santosher moto emon 
  smritishaktipurna sangbadik, kabi, ebong lekhak amader shahitya jagate ar keu 
  achhen bole ami bhabte parina. Jagat to sudhu ekta noi. Take je dharma, je 
  namei dakuk na keno. … Jiban sangrame amara sabai sainik. Santosh tar ateetke 
  jatai bhranto mone karik na keno, Santosh’o amar proti tar preeti o bhalobasar 
  byatikromer prokash dekhai ni. Santoshke’o ami amar jibaner ek atulaniya sangi 
  ebong suhrid hisebei dekhechhi. </i>(I don’t think I have seen any one like 
  Santosh – a journalist, a poet, a writer in our literary world. …. The world 
  is just not one- by whatever name a religion may define it. …. In our 
  continued fight for life, we are all soldiers. In pointing out his past as 
  faulty whatever Santosh might say today, he never showed any deviation from 
  showing me love and respect. Me too, I have always treated Santosh as 
  incomparable companion of my life and a great friend. ).</p>
