		<p class="MsoBodyText2" align="justify"><font size="3">In my last 
		dispatch (see: </font>
	<a href="../../Articles/ajoy/president_state_power2.html">
	<span style="text-decoration: none">President Assumes St. Power-2)</span></a><font size="3"> 
		I narrated how the President took steps to become the chief adviser of 
		the ensuing caretaker government. He very cleverly managed to by pass 
		the provisions 58(c) (3) and (4) which provide to chose the chief 
		adviser from among the apex court judges. When the justice KM Hasan’s 
		decline was known to the President on October 28, 2006, afternoon he 
		should have immediately asked Justice Mahmudul Amin Choudhury next to 
		Justice KM Hasan under the circumstances as his predecessor in the list 
		of supreme court chief justices Justice Mainul Reza Choudhury is dead to 
		take the oath as chief adviser when Justice Mahmudul Amin Choudhury made 
		to the President his position very clear by saying that he was ready to 
		take over the office of the chief adviser and question of 
		‘embarrassment’ on his part did not arise. Instead the President asked 
		the BNP high command what to do. The high command asked the President 
		not appoint him as CA on the plea that he will not be acceptable to them 
		because his constitutional position is not clear regarding his 
		eligibility to be considered as CA from among the list of chief 
		justices. President like an obedient boy cancelled the name of Justice 
		Mahmudul Amin Choudhury. In this regard let hear what Justice Choudhury 
		had to say. According to the interview he gave to a local daily press 
		reporter over telephone, “On Saturday night he had a telephone call from 
		Bangavaban. The military secretary of the President on behalf of the 
		President wanted to know if he would feel embarrassed in accepting the 
		post of CA. The justice told him that would not, and ready to accept it 
		if the President request him formally. No feed back was sent to him any 
		more.” (Bhorer Kagoj, October 30, 2006). Even there is no reference to 
		this in the address of President as CA on October 29, 2006 night.</font>
		</p>
		<h3><font color="#008000">Justice Hamidul Haque, retired judge of 
		appellate division declined under duress ?&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></h3>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">By passing provision 58(C) (3), the 
		President invoked 58(C) (4) in a very clever move to find a retired 
		judge from appellate division again with the intention of bluffing the 
		public and the opposition. He by passed the first name Justice MA Aziz 
		on the plea that the judge is currently holding the constitutional 
		position of CEC. Intention was very clear and had two-fold purpose. The 
		President knew very well that MA Aziz would not be favoured by the 
		opposition because of his controversial role in election commission so (i) 
		he struck of his name from the least on the surface to appease the AL 
		and its allies, and (ii) the BNP and its allies need Aziz to stay on in 
		EC to materialize their evil design of election maneuvering. <O></O>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">The next man in the list was Justice 
		Hamidul Haque. The Bangavaban played also a very clever game with the 
		intention of getting a “NO” from the justice. The circumstantial 
		indicate clearly that a pressure if not directly but indirectly, was put 
		on his shoulder to express his “embarrassment”. It is learnt that 
		justice Haque was mentally ready to accept the office of the CA if he 
		were acceptable to both major parties, namely AL and BNP. 
<O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">According to press report it is learnt 
		that on Saturday night (28<sup>th</sup> October) he received a phone 
		call from the military secretary of the President asking him if he would 
		feel embarrassed in accepting the post of CA. He agreed to accept the 
		office if both major parties agreed. From the other end he was told that 
		one party had reservation about him with implied indication it would be 
		easier for the President if he said no. Feeling the implied desire he 
		decided to decline and handed over a hand written letter of ‘NO’ to a 
		man from Bangavaban. His letter was written very hurriedly which is very 
		obvious as there were many strikes and then insertion here and there. As 
		appeared in the press he put forward two reasons for his decline in 
		order to avoid controversy and lessen the tension of the situation.<O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">(1). A section of law experts said that in 
		the absence of Justice Hasan, next man to be considered for CA should be 
		Justice Justice Mahmudul Amin Choudhury. In this backdrop if he accepted 
		the office of CA his choice would have been questionable.<O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">(2). Mr. Mannan Bhuiyan, SG of BNP raised 
		his capability of becoming the CA. <O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">When he was asked about his incapability, 
		raised by Mannan Bhuiyan, the Justice commented that he had no knowledge 
		why he raised such question. If he meant constitutionally, then it is a 
		debatable, but he meant otherwise regarding his fitness physically and 
		mentally he commented, “ I am physically and mentally quite fir to 
		accept such office. It is unfortunate the Mr. Bhuiyan raised such 
		question about me.”<O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">Bhorer Kagoj reported that one of its 
		reporters had a talk with Justice Haque at 8 pm night on Saturday, 
		October 28, 2006 when he had expressed that he were ready to accept the 
		post of CA if President requested him. But what happened in one hour 
		after receiving a phone call from the military secretary from Bangavaban 
		is any body’s guess. We could only speculate. According to a source 
		close to the justice his ‘NO’ was extracted from Bangavaba under duress. 
		A gentleman from the President’s behalf from Bangavaban came to his 
		residence and collected a hand written letter of ‘NO’ very hurriedly on 
		the night of Saturday (October 28, 2006). <O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">Now let us analyse the action and 
		behaviour of the President in respect of two judges- Justice Mahmudul 
		Amin Choudhury and Justice Hamidul Haque, both satisfy the requirement 
		of the article 58(C) (7). The courtesy demands that in a serious matter 
		like choosing a person for the post of CA, President should have invited 
		Justice Mahmudul Amin Choudhury first if the President though he fits in 
		according to the constitution instead of seeking his opinion over phone 
		through a third person like his military secretary. Justice Choudhury 
		was not only a very capable judge of the apex court, but is a very 
		learned man, as I heard. Unless he had convinced himself that according 
		to the provision of the constitution (58(C ) (3) ) he is fully eligible 
		to assume the office of the CA he would not have said that he was ready 
		to accept the office of the CA. President could have discussed the 
		matter frankly with him and sought his advice. The Justice would have 
		gladly pointed out if there were any constitutional lacuna in appointing 
		him as CA. If the President had any doubt regarding constitutional 
		interpretation he could have asked him or referred the matter to the 
		Supreme Court. Instead our most obedient president followed what the Ex 
		PM and her gang instructed him to do. Regarding Justice Hamidul Haque 
		the President behaved with him very discourteously – he should have been 
		invited by the President and discuss the matter. Why he should be not 
		acceptable to all as he fulfilled all requirements. President just acted 
		as per instruction of BNP high command as Mr. Mannan Bhuiyan questioned 
		his incapability. If Justice Haque had no political association nor had 
		any other disqualification as per provision of the constitution 58(C ) 
		(7) then why President should listen to a silly objection of Mannan 
		Bhuiyan or his Chairperson Begum Khaleda. He listened to them because he 
		was told to do so in materializing the grand scheme of making the 
		President their caretaker government head. <O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">The President then entered the final act 
		of the drama. He staged an eye wash show of political dialogue, which 
		included Jamat, JP and VNP on one hand (whose views would be more or 
		less identical – ‘Whatever the President do we will agree, we have 
		confidence in him’) and on other hand single party AL. This farcical 
		dialogue is bound to fail and the President new it very well. The AL 
		formally handed over a letter containing their suggestion. But 
		unfortunately the President did not take any cognition of those 
		suggestions in stead he sided with the desire of the BNP gang led by 
		Deshanetri Khaleda Begum. Taking advantage of the failure of the 
		political dialogue with the President under 58(C) (5) he opted for 
		applying the last provision of the constitution 58(C) (6) by which he 
		made him the Chief Adviser of the caretaker government. 
<O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">Question is why the President became so 
		impatient to select the chief adviser so hurriedly as if his time is 
		running out. Firstly why he limited himself with three pro BNP and only 
		one opposition party. The constitution permitted him to have 
		consultation with ‘major’ political parties ‘as far as practicable’. He 
		has invited not a single left party with in the alliance or outside the 
		alliance. As if he has not heard the name of Workers Party, JSD led by 
		Inu, Gana Forum, CPB (outside the 14 party alliance) and newly formed 
		Liberal Democratic Party led by Dr. Badruddoza and Col. Oli Ahmed. Even 
		he omitted JP of Anwar Hosain who had parliament representation. 
<O></O></span></p>
		<h3><font color="#008000">Has the President exhausted all his means 
		before putting him in the office of CA ? </font> <O></O></h3>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">I believe not. The spirit of the 
		constitution is never intended to place the responsibility of the office 
		of CA under the President. This is the last resort when all the previous 
		were exhausted. The constitution’s very intention is to give priority to 
		the retired Chief Justices&nbsp;&nbsp; of Supreme Court and judges of the 
		appellate division. As pointed out earlier the President very hurriedly 
		by passed those provisions. He then farcically terminated the so-called 
		political dialogue announcing its failure. It is very difficult to 
		understand that the President could not find a single non-party person 
		acceptable to all concerned from among 12 crores of people. He should 
		have explored other sources- such as consulting with section of citizens 
		known as civil society who could assist him in his search. Another one 
		or two days would have not mattered. Unfortunately the President had 
		mind-set in appointing him as CA as per instruction and directives of 
		his benefactor. <O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">All his actions point that he went through 
		did all these eye wash steps to materialize the grand scheme of election 
		engineering and manipulation. The design was cleverly planned and very 
		subtlety executed through the office of the President. The plan of 
		getting a CA of BNP’s choice has a few alternatives each one has to be 
		carried out is the earlier one fails. First BNP put their eggs, not all 
		on the basket of Justice Hasan and tried their ultimate end to make it 
		success by staging Hasan-Drama; if the President was not able to face 
		the situation because of his ill health or incapability then he was 
		asked to go to CMH vacating the President’s chair. Mr. Jamiruddin Sarkar, 
		the speaker would do the needful to install Justice Hasan. But decline 
		of Hasan prompted them to switch over to stage the second drama may be 
		termed as Eiazuddin-Drama in which President Eiazuddin was the chief 
		actor. The grand design of the scheme was to put their man in the chair 
		of CA, which they successfully did. But why they are keen to put Hasan 
		or Eiazuddin in that chair. They want to be 100% sure that their man if 
		put in the chair of CA then the grand and skillful election mechanism, 
		popularly known as election engineering could be materialized and the 
		BNP could return triumphantly to state power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <O></O></span></p>
		<h3><font color="#008000">Is President a non-party man ?</font></h3>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">The answer is simply no. Politically he 
		was the follower of BNP while he was a teacher in the belonged to what 
		is called Sada dal. As far as I know he is a man of week character, meek 
		personality, flatterer and man of high ambition. He was one of the most 
		beneficiaries among the pro BNP intellectual. He had been serving the 
		BNP interest very faithfully for a long time for which he was amply 
		rewarded- he was the adviser of caretaker government of Justice 
		Sahabuddin as a BNP nominee, he was made chairman of the Public Service 
		Commission and served BNP interest very faithfully, he was chairman of 
		the University Grants Commission, and finally he was made the President 
		as a BNP nominee. Even after becoming the President he never uttered, as 
		far as I remember, that henceforth he became a non parry neutral man 
		severing his all past association with BNP. On the other hand he 
		faithfully served the interest of BNP acting more as BNP nominated 
		President rather than country’s President. 
<O></O></span></p>
		<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;</span><font color="#008000">Can the 
		President rise above BNP domination ?&nbsp; </font></h3>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">Many have expressed hope and put faith in 
		President Eiazuddin’s wisdom that he has a great challenge ahead to 
		prove himself a truly neutral man and non-party man. I have my serious 
		doubt in his capability and sincerity in view of, particularly, the way 
		he manipulated the provisions of the constitutions and violated the 
		spirit of constitution by putting him in the office of the CA. Why did 
		he do that? He was put in the chair by his mentors to carry out the 
		election winning mechanism designed and planned by the BNP high command. 
		The man who can condone a killer-convict of death penalty because the 
		killer was a BNP party cadre at the instance of BNP high command, how 
		can I put my faith in his wisdom, judgment and integrity who can hold a 
		free and fair election and act as a neutral nonpartisan president and 
		chef adviser. 
<O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">So from the above facts and analysis, I 
		think the President has occupied the chair of the CA through a 
		constitutional coup de tat, of course bloodless. He is the most powerful 
		man in Bangladesh to day– enjoying the privilege of the President, 
		holding the executive power by grabbing the office of CA and the armed 
		forces is under his disposal during the tenure of caretaker government 
		as the President apart from being the constitutional supreme commander 
		of the armed forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . <O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<font size="4" color="#008000">Is the President eligible to hold the 
		office of the Chief Adviser ? </font></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify"><font size="2">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">A valid question has been raised whether 
		the President Dr. Eiazuddin Ahmed is eligible for becoming the Chief

		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">* Retired Chief Justice (s) of the Supreme

		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">Each one of the categories above must also 
		fulfill 4 eligibility requirements as stated above. The President fails 
		to fulfill the age requirement (e), as he is now 76 years of much over 
		72. Under this score the President Dr. Eiazuddin Ahmed is not eligible 
		to hold the office of the CA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <O></O></span></p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify">
		<span style="font-size: 12pt">&nbsp;Many argue in favour of Dr. Eiazuddin 
		that he is immune from condition as he is the President. They stress 
		that for President becoming CA ‘Presidentship’ is the only criteria. 
		Those conditions are applicable only to the judges and citizens. But 
		nowhere in the constitution it is said that the President is immune from 
		those conditions. To me it does not sound a valid argument. The 
		constitution cannot make such discrimination between the President and 
		other category stated in the 58(C) (3) – (6). The constitutional 
		treatment must be equal to all in appointing a CA from whatever category 
		he comes from President or no President. <O></O></span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 12pt">This is the precise reason why I termed

		many will disagree with me.

		not undertaken such huge responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <O></O></span></p>
