	<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
	<h1>AL is united as ever</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">It appears that Awami 
	League, perhaps in view of the country wide moderate protests from the grass 
	roots level, possible under the emergency prevailing in the country, is 
	united on the issue of Sheikh’s illogical, if not illegal, arrest. The 
	reformists have shelved their current activities of reformation in the 
	party. Agni Kanya Matia Choudhury, a member of AL presidium, immediately 
	after the arrest o Hasina reacted very sharply accusing the reformists group 
	in AL for the arrest of AL chief. She contended that the Government took the 
	advantage of apparent disunity among the top AL leaders. She further said 
	that Government is out to eliminate AL from BD political field as it 
	considers AL as the main obstacle to their design. On the other hand 
	spokesman of the reformists criticized Begum Choudhury for her pointed 
	remarks urging every one not to give any statements that might jeopardize 
	the party. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Today Mr. Jillur Rahman, 
	who has immediately taken over the office of AL president, as acting 
	chairman according to AL party constitution, categorically said that AL is 
	united on the issue of Sheikh Hasina. The declaration came after the top AL 
	leaders including Tofael Ahmed, Mr. Abdur Razzak, two freedom fighters who 
	played key roles in the 69-movement and non-cooperation movement that 
	followed after President Yahya Khna 1<sup>st</sup> March announcement 
	postponing meeting of National assembly in Dhaka met the acting president. 
	It appears that reformists have shelved the reformation activities at least 
	for the time being. Jillur Rahman’s main points are as disclosed to the 
	press: </p>
	<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="disc">
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Awami League being a 
		Democratic Party there would always be difference of opinions on many 
		national and international issues, but at the time of crisis the Party 
		has always faced it united. So the AL’s main concern is at this moment 
		to stand behind its Chief Sheikh Hasina and seek her release. </li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Mr. Rahman said that 
		there would be no activities regarding reformation inside the party till 
		AL chief is released.&nbsp; </li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The government’s 
		action transferring the case against Hasina under emergency rules is not 
		legal, observed Mr. Rahman. The so called case of extortion of money had 
		taken place, if at all true, eight years back, and emergency rule has 
		been introduced just recently. So no one can be tried for an offence 
		under the law, which was, or existent then. </li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">On this issue, the AL 
		legal experts will challenge it at the HC division. The AL has 
		constituted a legal aid team from among the senior lawyers.</li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The AL will also move 
		a bail petition at the judge court challenging the decision of the lower 
		court given on 16<sup>th</sup> July by DMC. </li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">The acting chairman 
		appealed to the countrymen to keep calm and united. He also demanded 
		punishment of those members of the disciplinary forces who maltreated 
		and misbehaved with the AL chief as if she is a thief or a murderer. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
	<h1>Protest continues throughout the country</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Modest protest under 
	emergency situation continued in many parts of the country including 
	Sunamganj, Shylhet, Gopalganj, Rangpur .. . In many places shops were found 
	closed and strikes were observed in many educational institutions. On the 
	other hand police is taking stern actions against the protester including 
	arrests of local AL leaders and workers. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">Dhaka University Teachers 
	Association came out openly today to stand behind the captive Sheikh Hasina. 
	They demanded immediately release of the once opposition leader and the 
	chief of AL terming the action of the army directed CTG of Mr. Fakhruddin 
	Ahmed as politically motivated with the ill intention of elimination of the 
	largest people based democratic political party. In a meeting of the 
	Association decisions declare that present activities of the government it 
	seems are not directed to hold election, nor to punish the known and captive 
	corrupted politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats (civil and military), 
	miscreant and anti socials. The meeting also asked the government not to 
	harass and threaten top political leaders including BNP chief unnecessary. 
	The meeting urged upon the President to withdraw the emergency to restore 
	the freedom, liberty of each and every citizen of the country. The DU 
	teachers further said that government’s recent activities pointed that it 
	has an agenda to put a government of their choice that would be almost 
	pseudo military in nature under the shadow umbrella of the Security Council. 
	The resolutions also reminded the government if their demands were not, DUTA 
	would float further programme of action befitting to its past tradition. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">DUTA also 
	demanded the removal of Barrister Moinul Islam from adviser as he has lost 
	his neutrality, the prerequisite of an adviser.</span></p>
