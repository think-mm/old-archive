	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a tragic fire 
	accident at KTS garments and Textile Mills near Kalurghat over 54 garments 
	laborers (according to official estimate) lost their lives and hundreds 
	received serious injuries. The unofficial sources claims the numbers of dead 
	would be much mire than the official figure. Many dead bodies were taken to 
	unknown destinations claimed the relatives of missing laborers. Among the 
	dead 45 were women. An unofficial organization informed that missing 
	laborers who were inside the mill exceeded hundreds. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How the fire broke 
	out in the ground floor on Thursday evening (23<sup>rd</sup> February 2006) 
	is any boy’s guess. One source said that in the evening of 23<sup>rd</sup> 
	February a few laboures were mending a stairs with gas welding in a space 
	between the boiler and generator. All on a sudden a spark fell on the 
	generator, which caused immediate fire. The boiler burst out with fire and 
	it spread inside the mill area where hundreds of laborers were working. 
	However, how far the theory is correct no body knew. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is reported 
	that the factory, owned by one Wahidul Islam Selim, a local BNP leader, has 
	practically no fire protection equipment and or other facilities. It has no 
	emergency exits. When the fire broke out in the four-storied building, it is 
	alleged that security officers asked the workers to keep themselves calm and 
	remain inside. They assured them that fire brigades are operating and soon 
	it would be brought under control. The security man then locked the entrance 
	and silently fled away. The workers finding no way out just were just burnt 
	alive. There were no minimum safety arrangements nor has emergency accident 
	meeting force or equipment inside the mill. The factory owners just defy the 
	ILO specified safety prescriptions to implement.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">After receiving the news at about 7-30 .m. 
	the fire brigade workers from Kalurghat and other adjacent areas rushed to 
	the scene. But because of main and the only entrance was under lock and key 
	they found it difficult rush into the building’s inside. The operating chief 
	claimed if the gates were not closed the causality would have been much less 
	and many lives could have saved. Neither the owner nor the top officials 
	were found near the place of occurrence when the operation of fire 
	extinction and recovery were going on. </span></font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">These officials and the owner must be 
	immediately brought to the justice and put behind the bar. They can just 
	play with the lives of innocent girls for their own profit. They must 
	realize that these girls are helping earning with their day and night labor 
	more that 76% of our foreign exchange earnings. Where is our garrulous 
	finance minister ? Why can’t he ensure the minimum safety arrangements and 
	conducive working environment for the workers of the factory? The business 
	community, the chambers of commerce and other business welfare associations 
	and organizations and finally Bangladesh Government and its charming PM 
	cannot escape their responsibility for series of accidents in the garments 
	and other industrial establishments. They must punish the culprits otherwise 
	resign from the government. Mere routine expression of condolence, sympathy 
	for the dead and injured and directives of proper treatment of the victims 
	to the doctors and hospital authority would not just do. We demand much more 
	from you, our Madame Prime Minister. </span></font></p>

	Adam are lying dead and injured under the heavy debris. The recovery work 
	under the supervision of the BD army in which joined the fire brigade, and 
	common men and laborers shows how inadequately ill equipped we are in 
	meeting devastation and calamity. The rescue team from the fire brigade came 
	at about 1 p.m. but very little they could do because of lack of equipment. 
	Then came one or two small size bulldozers of the City Corporation. These 
	are found too weak to handle the situation. Finally Army arrived at the 
	scene with their somewhat heavy machineries. Those too were found inadequate 
	to deal with magnitude of the catastrophe. Before the arrival of the 
	professional brigades, the common people with their improvised method jumped 
	into recovery operation immediately after the collapse. Many injured and 
	dead bodies these people brought to surface and took to the hospitals.

	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">The building is located in the Tezgaon 
	Industrial area at the entrance of the road that leads to Gulshan 1. The 
	Rajuk authority in an attempt to shrug off its responsibility, said that it 
	is not the duty of the Rajuk to monitor the condition of would be collapsing 
	buildings. It is the duty of the city corporation. Rajuk said that the said 
	building is being built without the authorized sanction of the Rajuk. Might 
	be it was sanctioned for two storied construction. Rajuk said that the 
	building collapsed because of its inadequate soil test, weak foundation and 
	defective design. It is a revealing story that, if Rajuk’s statement is 
	true, how without Rajuk’s permission a vendor can raise a building under the 
	very nose of the Rajuk, Ministry of Civil construction, led by Golum Abbas 
	Mirza (I guess), and city corporation authority. May we ask who will monitor 
	work and construction of multistoried building? Mr. Abbas cannot escape his 
	responsibility; he must come out with an adequate explanation why Spectrum 
	Garments and the building in question and the likes collapsing and taking 
	lives of the innocent workers. </span></font></p>
