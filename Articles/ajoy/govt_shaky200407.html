	<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: maroon"><font face="Verdana">
	Government declares war against an Individual !</font></span></u></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;<font face="Verdana">All 
	powerful military backed caretaker government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, it 
	seems, all on a sudden is getting nervous about AL chief Sheikh Hasina’s 
	return to Bangladesh. It was no secret that the AL chief went to USA a month 
	ago on a private visit. It was also known that she would return to Dhaka 
	after a month. At the time of her exit to USA on legal visa, neither the 
	government nor Sheikh Hasina or her party any time let us know that she was 
	forcibly driven out of the country. Nor the government of Fakhruddin Ahmed 
	felt sigh of relief on Hasina’s leaving the country on 5<sup>th</sup> March 
	2007. But to be honest the time was full of rumor that the CTG was trying 
	hard to get rid of Begum Khaleda and Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh politics 
	to the pave the way introducing reforms of clean politics. Many considered 
	Sheikh Hasina’s trip to USA a positive step towards that goal, although AL 
	made it clear that its chief was scheduled to return Dhaka within a month or 
	so. Begum Khaleda, it was rumored, would soon follow suit, but in reality it 
	did not materialize.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Even 
	Sheikh Hasina’s arch enemies either in the government or outside could not 
	bring any charges against her personally, or AL of any activities that have 
	had embarrassed the government. I would rather say that she acted like an 
	obedient law abiding citizen rather than the chief of a popular political 
	party. She even praised the government for taking stern actions against the 
	corrupted politicians. She did neither go out of the way in supporting the 
	top leaders of her own party arrested on charge of corruptions. She and her 
	party also hailed the reconstitution of the election commission and steps 
	being taken for introduction of transparent ballot boxes, making of voter ID 
	cards, promised fresh fault free neutral and authentic voters list. Even 
	when the government banned political activities in any form she did not 
	protest even in mild languages. In a nutshell she whole heartedly cooperated 
	with the government as could be expected from a mature political leader. 
	Only thing she demanded from the government of Fakhruddin Ahmed a fair deal 
	and treatment of her party and should not have been equated with the corrupt 
	BNP, which governed us through corruption, inefficiency and favouritism. 
	What she demanded not to compare BNP, a party in power for the last 5 years 
	with a party in opposition i.e. AL. What she demanded to and asked from the 
	caretaker government a firm date of holding a free, fair and meaningful 
	election, acceptable to all including international community. I think there 
	is nothing wrong in it. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">It 
	seemed everything were fine with the CTG of BD, the country is being 
	governed as planned- the Chief of the CTG assured the nation that a general 
	election would be held by 2008, every day top names including Tareq Rahman, 
	Barrister Maudud Ahmed and Arafat, younger son of Begum Ziaur Rahman, 
	associated with corruption are being hauled or arrested by the law enforcing 
	agencies. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Then 
	on all a sudden something went wrong within the government. Firstly, 
	obviously at the instance of the government charge of extortion of huge 
	money (by an individual on 9<sup>th</sup> April 2007) and a murder charge 
	against AL chief was brought in on 11<sup>th</sup> April 20 2007 in 
	connection of the incident of 28<sup>th</sup> April last year at Paltan. 
	Even the Law adviser, ever smiling and all knowing Barrister Mainul Hosain 
	remarked that such charges could not be brought against the AL chief and 
	erstwhile leader of the opposition. The powerful adviser general Matin 
	commented that ‘We have referred the matter to ‘Commission for 
	Anticorruption (DUDAK)’ to investigate. We will see that honour of such a 
	personality is maintained.’</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Secondly, when it became known that Hasina would return Dhaka on 14<sup>th</sup> 
	April 2007</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">to 
	face the charges, government seemed to get nervous, although openly there 
	were no sign of reaction. General Matin once again commented that government 
	would see that her honor and dignity were respected indirectly referring to 
	the charges being investigated in anticorruption commission. It was also 
	rumored that a government message was sent to Hasina requesting her to delay 
	her return in view of the conditions obtaining in the country. Apparently 
	the AL chief respected the government desire and rescheduled her plan to 
	return to Dhaka on 23<sup>rd</sup> April 2007. Both Barrister Hosain and 
	General Matin, two vocal members of the caretaker government once again 
	commented that there would be no problem if she returns. Thirdly all on a 
	sudden within twenty-four hours both advisers disclosed that a press note 
	‘is being issued on Sheikh Hasina’s proposed return to Dhaka on 23<sup>rd</sup> 
	April 2007’. A stern attitude was reflected on the face of Barrister Moinul 
	Hosain, and grim faced Matin refused to comment beyond what was in the press 
	note (18<sup>th</sup> April 2007). Adviser Moinul Hosain categorically said 
	that a request has been made to her not to return now because the government 
	does not want to put her in embarrassing situation, particularly in view of 
	some cases and recent comments made in USA. The press note is preemptive and 
	temporary action so that she does not return. But in case she arrives at 
	Dhaka, the Government would then take action, the adviser indicated firmly. 
	When pointed out that their earlier stand that government has no pressure on 
	Begum Khaleda’s leaving the country nor on Sheikh Hasina’s return 
	contradicts the Government Press note pressurizing Sheikh Hasina not to 
	return, Barrister Hosain offered only a smiling face to the journalists.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 
	meanwhile Sheikh Hasina arrived London on way to Dhaka yesterday (19<sup>th</sup> 
	April 2007) in the afternoon where she declared that she was firm to return 
	to Dhaka on 23<sup>rd</sup> April by British airways. It was however learnt 
	that British Airways might refuse to carry her to Dhaka although she has 
	valid ticket. In view of the government press note banning Sheikh Hasina to 
	land Dhaka airport. In case of such an event i.e. British Airways refusing 
	AL chief to issue boarding pass to Dhaka Sheikh Hasina said that she would 
	gave no other alternative but to return USA. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana"><u>
	<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: maroon">What were in the press note?</span></u></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana"><u>
	<span style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 14.0pt; color: maroon">&nbsp;</span></u></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	press note has three parts: (1) It held Sheikh Hasina responsible chaos 
	confusion lawlessness, anarchism and economic disruption in the country 
	because of uninterrupted <i>hartal</i>, <i>aborodh (encirclement)</i>, 
	processions, meetings etc called by AL and its 14 party alliance in recent 
	past. And because of these the emergency had to be imposed. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">This 
	is the first time Government blamed directly Sheikh Hasina for imposition of 
	emergency on by the President. But hundred-dollar question is does 
	government realize what is the consequence of such acquisitions against 
	Sheikh Hasina and her alliance? Has the government forgotten that its very 
	existence was the outcome of the movement launched by AL and its alliance? 
	Has the government willfully forgotten that whatever good works government 
	did were the demands of the movement? </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">(2) 
	The press note further alleged that Sheikh Hasina while in abroad made 
	speeches and comments criticizing the caretaker government and the law and 
	order agencies. The same good old acquisitions used to be made by the 
	government in power. I expected the government of Fakhruddin Ahmed would be 
	above such petty narrowness and prove itself an exception. Even the 
	allegations were true, which I doubt very much, how does these speeches 
	weaken the all-powerful government. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">(3) 
	The press note then apprehending that Sheikh Hasina would land Dhaka airport 
	defying the government ban prescribed some precautionary measures. The 
	government wishes that (i) no airlines would agree to take Hasina to Dhaka 
	obliging the BD government’s press note, (ii) the immigration authority will 
	bar her entering the country even if she landed at Zia International 
	airport, (iii) Police would take appropriate action including arresting her 
	on the already framed charges of corruption and murder at the airport.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana"><u>
	<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: maroon">Can Government issue such a 
	press note?</span></u></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">In my 
	long life I have never seen such an ill conceived and ill composed press 
	note. Firstly, it was directed against an Individual’s right to re-enter 
	one’s own country with valid documents of travel, whatever the status of 
	such an individual. Does government realize to what extent it has brought 
	down its prestige by issuing instructions to airlines to do the needful 
	barring Sheik Hasina’s entry to Bangladesh, which means that airlines must 
	not issue tickets or even if they have issued ticket, they would not allow 
	the AL chief to board the carrier at the request of the government. Now can 
	a government with minimum sense of honor and dignity could make such illegal 
	request not allowing a passenger to board the plane even if the passenger 
	have valid tickets and travel documents. Are the carriers legally bound to 
	respect government’s such silly request? </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">Latest 
	news from London indicates that Sheikh Hasina has accepted the challenge 
	thrown by the government trying to bar her entry. She is scheduled to fly 
	back home on 23<sup>rd</sup> April 2007. In the mean while She has met with 
	members of British parliament, and obviously the subject of discussion was 
	her return to Bangladesh. It is now interesting to see: </font></p>
