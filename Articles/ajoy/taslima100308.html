		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On twenty-ninth February 2008 
		around 3 p.m. Bangladesh time, my telephone rang. A female sweet voice 
		inquired, &quot;May I speak to Professor Ajoy Roy please? `Speaking' was my 
		answer. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">`Ajoy babu, Ami Taslima' (Mr. 
		Roy, I am Taslima), the anxious female voice imploded. `Kon Taslima' 
		(which Taslima)?, was my query ? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">`Ami Taslima Nasrin' (It is me, 
		sir, Taslima Nasrin). `What a pleasant surprise, where from are you 
		calling'? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Her voice sounded so clear and 
		distinct that for a moment I thought as if she is in Dhaka. `My god, are 
		you in Dhaka by any chance'. I could not believe it! </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">`No, sir. I do not know exactly 
		where I am. Only thing I know, as told by the security people, that I am 
		somewhere in Delhi', I heard melancholy Taslima's lamenting voice. .
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Honestly speaking, this is the 
		last thing I expected even in my dream Taslima would be in touch with me 
		in her present unbearable inhuman sufferings. Any way miracle does 
		happen, it seems. If you, materialists, however agree to call this a 
		miracle. Let us call it a chance phenomenon. I wish I had many more such 
		chance but pleasant phenomena or events. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">`Ajoy Babu, Ami gato koyek mas 
		jabat, apnake jogajoger chestha korchhi, kintu parchhilam na. Ami prai 
		bondini. (Ajoy Sir, I have been trying to contact you for the last few 
		months since I was forcibly taken away from Calcutta. I am almost a 
		captive now in a solitary small house.' Only contact device I have now, 
		are my laptop and a cell phone.' she continued. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I reminded her that last 
		time I saw her in Kolkata I left with her my telephone numbers and 
		emails, she answered, </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I had to leave Kolkata in a 
		hurry, could not bring my notes and diaries except some personal 
		belongings. As a result I lost all your contacts.' </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">`How come then you got me on 
		telephone'?, my inquisitiveness continued. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">`At time I thought of writing to 
		Avijit, your son, whose email address I had for your email address. But 
		all on a sudden, I got your telephone number in a corner of some 
		personal papers. Perhaps I wrote it down when you contacted me from 
		Dhaka before coming to Kolkata last year in March. (hotath korei peye 
		gelum. Dhekhi ekta kagojer konai apnar phone numerti lekha royechhe)&quot;
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Readers, last year when I was in 
		Kolkata, I saw her in her Kolkata residence. We had a long chat on 
		Bangladesh, India and on international affairs. Our main theme of 
		discussion moved around `how to combat worldwide aggressive 
		fundamentalism, especially Islamic fundamentalism mixed with terrorism, 
		a phenomenon that has almost swallowed the civilized world. We agreed 
		that at present, the Islamic fundamentalism with its octopus-like limbs 
		and Ravanic twenty hands &amp; ten mouths has become a threat to 
		civilization &amp; culture and all that stands for good, great, beauty 
		(Satyam Shivam Sundaram), fineness, logic and rationalism. Our talk 
		lasted not less than three hours during which she served with excellent 
		Indian dishes cooked by herself, as she told me. She is really very nice 
		cook apart from her poetic talents. I always considered and still of the 
		opinion that above all she is a poet of rare talents. Had she been not 
		gone through such plights she would have been bloomed into one of the 
		most creative poets in Bangla literature? She touches your hearts as 
		well as your intelligent mind. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Though I found her little home 
		sick, but never could foresee what was waiting for her in a few months 
		time last year. It all started, as you readers remember, with a small 
		incident in Hyderabad. But the central government failed fore read what 
		is in store for Taslima Nasrin and failed to measure the strength of the 
		communal and Islamic fundamentalists' grand design. How a secular 
		democratic government in Delhi could fail to deal with strong hand the 
		evil forces of communalism and fundamentalism. Net result is after 
		returning to Kolkata she had to leave the city for fear of 
		fundamentalist and anti secular forces. It is shame on the part of Union 
		government and the WB government led by Bhudhadev Bhattacharya, a 
		darling of many WB intellectuals. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During my last meeting with Dr. 
		Taslima, Nasrin one thing again and again popped up was her strong 
		desire to return to Dhaka. He requested me to do some thing for her safe 
		return to Bangladesh. I replied to her, &quot;I am a small man and I have 
		very little influence over the policy makers. Even then I tried to carry 
		her message to many corners but alas no one took the matter very 
		seriously saying `this is not the right time to raise the issue. This 
		will give the Islamic fundamentalists a key to feign ant-Taslima 
		campaign. Every one advised me to wait for suitable time after a new 
		elected government takes over the administration&gt;&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In an almost hour long 
		conversation she narrated her present plight. Now virtually she is 
		leading an isolated and solitary life confined in a small hose 
		surrounded by the security people. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">She said in a lamented voice, 
		&quot;Sir, you know, I am not allowed to move out freely. No one is allowed 
		to visit me, even my close friends in India and writers.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Why are they doing it to you. 
		You are neither a terrorist nor a violent personality, rather you are 
		one of the most pleasing and mild personality I have ever crossed 
		over.?&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;They are doing it to me so that 
		out of disgust I decide to leave India. Then the government India would 
		say that she intends to leave India on her own. The government will feel 
		relieved to get rid of me.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;What is the reason, can you 
		think off?&quot;, I inquired. Her reply was: </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Amar dharona paschim banga 
		sarkar ebong bharat sarkar musalman vote harabar bhoye moulabadi 
		musalmander toshan korchhe. Tai amake tara, bishe kore CPIM er netara 
		amake kolkata tyage badhya korechhe. Hoito tader paroksha madate 
		Kolkatai etobara demonstartion hoyechhe amar birudhe. Amar sunischit, 
		CPIM shahayata chhara moulabdider eto sahas hoto na amake tarate.&quot; ( I 
		think that WB government and Indian government influenced by the CPIM 
		leaders are appeasing the Muslim fundamentalists for the fear of loosing 
		Muslim voters. It is quite possible that with their tacit approval the 
		Muslim fundamentalists could arrange such a big demonstration against my 
		stay in Kolkata. Without CPM support it could never be held forcing me 
		to leave the city, I believe for certain. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The West Bengal Government 
		forced me leave Kolkata, which I had to very reluctantly&quot;, DR, Nasrin 
		concluded with a broken voice. I could listen to her weeping sounds in 
		silence. I felt so distressed and helpless. A girl of my daughrtr's age, 
		so celebrated a person, all on a sudden became a childlike entity?&quot;
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a chocked voice she appealed 
		to me, &quot;sir please does something for me so that I could return to 
		Bangadesh with full honour and dignity and have course, safety.&quot; </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I tried to convey her that 
		it is really very difficult for her to return to Bangladesh, unless a 
		new elected liberal government takes over the Bangladesh government. I 
		asked her until such time, we would try to do our best to return her to 
		Kolkata, the second best choice of her living, just a few hundred km 
		from Dhaka. She kept mum for a while and then said in a sobering voice,
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Apnara ja bhalo mone karen, tai 
		karun. Ami katha dichhi, Bhrate ba kolkatai thaka kale emon kichhu 
		korbona ja Paschim bangiya sashakder ba Bharatiya sarkarke bibrata 
		kore.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I told her in assuring voice, 
		&quot;We in Bangladesh do our best for your good. Do not give up hope and 
		courage.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">She kept silence a few minute, 
		and then said, &quot;Bhalo thakun, good buy&quot;. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Apnio Bhalo thakun. Hatash 
		hoben na. Jene rakhun apnake koti koti manush bhalobashe. Tader subechha 
		apnake barmer mato raksha korbe. buy. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Buy', she hang up the phone. I 
		hard the click sound of the cradle. My god, why the world is so cruel, I 
		wondered in despair </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In my next episode I will 
		forward the recent thoughts of Dr. Nasrin that she has forwarded to me 
		yesterday. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mukto-mona readers, please take 
		up your pen and flood the Indian President's PM's and WB Chief 
		Ministers' and CPIM Kolkata office with emails and faxes demanding 
		Taslima's safe return to Kolkata where she really belong next to 
		Bangladesh. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here is her desire to return to 
		BD found expression in
		<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/project/muktanwesa/1st_issue/pakhi_hoyew_Taslima.html">
