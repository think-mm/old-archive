		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Last night Dr. Eiazuddin Ahmed 
		seized the state power by appointing him Chief Adviser of the care-take 
		government (see
		<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/37409">part-1</a> 
		of the series). He was immediately shorn in as the chief adviser in an 
		oath taking ceremony at 8 pm evening by the Supreme Court chief justice. 
		In assuming state power the President invoked the article 58C(6) of 
		Chapter II A of Bangladesh constitution dealing with care-taker 
		government. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The sudden decision of taking 
		over the office of the chief adviser, which according to the 
		constitution enjoys the executive power and privilege as of Prime 
		Minister of the country, has raised eye brow of many including some 
		leading constitutional experts of the country. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many have raised the question if 
		the assumption of the office of the chief adviser is how far 
		constitutionally legal. Before we go to deal with question of 
		constitutional validity of Presidential step, let us examine what the 
		President said in his last nigh (October 29, 2006) broadcast to the 
		nation as the newly appointed chief adviser. Dr. Eiazuddin as the chief 
		adviser briefly narrated under what constitutional crisis he was to 
		assume the responsibility of the chief adviser. Before that let us 
		recall what the 58C(6) article of the constitution says that was invoked 
		by the President. The article says, </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“(6) Notwithstanding anything 
		contained in this chapter, if the provisions (3), (4) and (5) cannot be 
		given effect to, the President shall assume the functions of the Chief 
		Adviser of the Non-Party Care-taker Government in addition of his own 
		functions under this constitution.” </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The relevant clause indicates 
		that there are (3), (4) and (5) provisions prescribing how to choose a 
		possible chief adviser. It clearly says that President can become the 
		chief adviser only and only other three means completely fail. Now 
		question is has the president sincerely, diligently and intelligently 
		tried to apply those provisions to give effect. But before we go to the 
		question let us see what the president said in his nation wide broad 
		cast in his new role as the chief adviser. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we reported earlier, before 
		assuming the post of chief adviser, the President held series of talks 
		with a few chosen political parties through their representatives- these 
		include JP (Ershad), BNP, AL and Jamat I Islami (in all only 4 political 
		parties). In the afternoon of 29th October 2006 on behalf of the 
		President a brief press note was read out before the journalists in 
		which it was merely narrated the meeting of the President with important 
		political parties of the country, but there was no indication of outcome 
		of those talks or any decision (positive or negative) of the President, 
		nor president’s desire was reflected in the note. In fact it was a 
		meaningless note that only indicated that the President is continuing 
		his search for choosing a chief adviser. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What the Chief Adviser said to 
		the nation The chief adviser briefly put forward an explanation why he 
		had to assume the responsibility of the chief adviser in addition to his 
		own functions as the President. In this respect the chief adviser 
		informed the nation which may be presented in the following brief form:
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The country is passing through a 
		critical phase as the tenure of the elected government coming to an end. 
		Constitution says a care-taker government has to be constituted for 90 
		days immediately (within fifteen days of the dissolution of Parliament)
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to the constitution 
		Justice KM Hasan was to be the chief adviser, the most recently retired 
		chief justice of the supreme court, but as some political parties 
		expressed objection to his appointment and following their violent 
		programme of action he declined to accept it Next person to be chosen, 
		according to the provision of the constitution, was Justice Mainul Reza 
		Choudhury, who retired as Chief justice before justice Hasan, but he was 
		not available because of his death. Next choice fell on the most 
		recently retired judge of the Appellate division, Justice MA Aziz, but 
		as he is already holding a constitutional position of CEC, he is also 
		not available for the post of CA The next man in the series, according 
		to the constitution, is justice Hamidul Haque, who retired before 
		justice Aziz. But he declined to accept the office of CA, as two leading 
		political parties BNP and AL were not unanimous (according to the 
		President) on his choice. In this perspective the President held talks 
		with AL general secretary and BNP secretary general for reaching an 
		agreement; then on the following day he held talks with 4 principal 
		political party representatives who had representation in the dissolved 
		parliament with a view to find an acceptable citizen for the office of 
		CA as per provision of the constitution 58(C)(5). But president reported 
		in his address they failed to come to a unanimous agreement. Seeing no 
		other alternatives as per constitution he has to assume the office of 
		the chief adviser as per provision 58(C) (6) to save the country from 
		political uncertainty and violence. On its face value it will appear 
		from the Chief Advisor’s address that he had followed all the 
		constitutional means as stated in the article 58C (3) to (5) before 
		invoking (6). But thousand-dollar question is did he follow it in the 
		true spirit of the constitution. Before we examine this aspect, let us 
		see the article 58(C) of Chapter II A of the constitution that deals 
		with how a caretaker government is to be constituted: </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">CHAPTER IIA- NON-PARTY 
		CARE-TAKER GOVERBMENT </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">58C. (1) The Non-Party 
		Care-taker Government shall consist of the Chief Adviser at its head and 
		not more than ten other Advisers, all of whom shall be appointed by the 
		President. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(2) The Chief Adviser shall be 
		appointed within fifteen days after Parliament is dissolved or stands 
		dissolved and during the period between the date on which Parliament is 
		dissolved or stands dissolved and the date on which Chief Adviser is 
		appointed, the Prime Minister and his cabinet who were in office 
		immediately before Parliament was dissolved or stood dissolved shall 
		continue to hold office as such. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(3) The President shall appoint 
		as Chief Adviser the person who among the retired Chief Justices of 
		Bangladesh retired last and who is qualified to be appointed as an 
		Adviser under this article. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Provided that if such retired 
		Chief Justice is not available or is not willing to hold the office of 
		Chief Adviser the President shall appoint as Chief Adviser the person 
		who among the retired Chief Justices of Bangladesh retired next before 
		the last retired Chief Justice. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(4) If no retired Chief Justice 
		is available or willing to hold the office of Chief Adviser, the 
		President shall appoint as Chief Adviser the person who among the 
		retired judges of the Appellate Division retired last and who is 
		qualified to be appointed as an Adviser under this article. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Provided that if such retired 
		Judge is not available or is not willing to hold the office of Chief 
		Adviser, the President shall appoint as Chief Adviser the person who 
		among the retired Judges of the Appellate Division retired next before 
		the last such retired Judge. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(5) If no retired judge of the 
		Appellate Division is available or willing to hold the office of Chief 
		Adviser, the President shall, after consultation, as far as practicable, 
		with the major political parties, appoint the Chief Adviser from among 
		citizens of Bangladesh who are qualified to be appointed as advisers 
		under this article. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(6) Notwithstanding anything 
		contained in this chapter, if the provisions (3), (4) and (5) cannot be 
		given effect to, the President shall assume the functions of the Chief 
		Adviser of the Non-Party Care-taker Government in addition of his own 
		functions under this constitution. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(7) The President shall appoint 
		Advisers from among the persons who are- </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(a) qualified for election as 
		members of Parliament; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(b) not members of any political 
		party or of any organization associated with or affiliated to any 
		political party; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(c) not, and have agreed in 
		writing not to be, candidates for the ensuing election of members of 
		Parliament; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(d) not over seventy-two years 
		of age. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(8) The President on the advice 
		of the Chief Adviser shall appoint the Advisers. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If we look at the provision 
		58(C) (3) there is no ambiguity regarding the first paragraph which 
		clearly states that the chief adviser will be the last retired chief 
		justice of the supreme court provided he fulfils qualification set in 
		article 58(C) (7) for becoming an adviser of the caretaker government. 
		So just not being a last retired chief justice he has to pass through 
		the eligibility as adviser. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But regarding the second 
		paragraph of the article is there an unambiguous interpretation- 
		question is being raised. If the last retired chief justice is not 
		available then the chief justice who retired just before him becomes the 
		automatic choice for CA. Upto this there is no ambiguity but question is 
		if the second chief justice also is not available (for whatever reason) 
		then what, will the process ends here and provision 58(C) (4) has to be 
		revoked. The interpretation varies. Most of the leading lawyers of the 
		Supreme Court opine that the spirit of the constitution is to find a 
		chief justice of the Supreme Court to assume the office of CA in 
		preference to choices of other categories mentioned in subsequent 
		articles. So the process has to be continued till a suitable chief 
		justice is available for CA who fulfils article 58(c) (7) 
		simultaneously. If this attempt fails then and then only next provision 
		is to be invoked. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us see under this provision 
		that were the probable eligible CA. As far as information available to 
		us, the list may be as follows: </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Justice KM Hasan, most recently 
		retired chief justice of SC, who declined to assume the office of CA 
		Justice Mainul Reza Choudhury, next retired Chief justice before justice 
		Hasan (died few years back) Justice Mahmudul Amin Choudhury, next 
		retired Chief justice before Justice Mainul Reza Choudhury. As 1 and 2 
		were not available, number 3 becomes automatic choice who also fulfils 
		the eligibility set forth in article 58(C) (7). Accordingly the 
		President should approach him for assuming the post of CA, and in fact 
		the President contacted him through his military secretary if he were 
		agreeable to assume the office of CA to which Justice Mahmudul Amin 
		Choudhury responded positively. But when the final choice was made he 
		was by passed, under out going PM’s and her hawkish BNP stalwart’s high 
		pressure. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">President then as it appears on 
		surface invoked article 58(C) (4) to find a CA from among the retired 
		judges of the Appellate Division. He limited his selection among only 
		two judges, namely- </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Justice MA Aziz, who most 
		recently retired, now holding the post of CEC, another constitutional 
		position? Justice Hamidul Haque, retired immediately before MA Aziz and 
		qualifies for the office of CA as per article 58(C) (7). President did 
		not take into account of the name of MA Aziz as he is now CEC (who has 
		already earned a very good name as CEC !). By passing MA Aziz the 
		President approached Justice Hamidul Haque again through his military 
		secretary and under pressure the President managed to get a letter of 
		decline. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is learnt that earlier 
		Justice Haque was mentally prepared to accept the office of CA if both 
		the leading political parties (BNP and AL) accept him. In obtaining the 
		letter of decline from the Bangavaban it was made known to him that BNP 
		has reservation over him, and even then if he is willing. Sensing the 
		desire of the president, Justice Haque hurriedly send a hand written 
		letter. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">o it appears president is moving 
		forward to materialize his own scheme of becoming the CA, perhaps as 
		desired by his mentor BNP chief Deshonetri Begum Khaleda, the erstwhile 
		PM. President then stage the final drama, the story of which forms the 
		material of 3rd part of the present Eiajuddin-drama. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">End of Part II </font></p>
