	curfew - army guided Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed-Government’s latest gift to the 
	nation. The CA has imposed, after duly getting approval from the meeting of 
	the battery of advisers, attended by Army Chief, Chief of the army staff, 
	BDR chief, Police Chief and many top brasses and bureaucrats, a continuous 
	curfew from 8 p.m. night to an indefinite period (!) on August 22, 2007 in 
	all five divisional head quarters including the capital. This was imposed in 
	order to deal with the undisciplined crowed, in the language of the 
	Government statement, on the streets for ‘bringing back the normal life and 
	save public properties’. Are these utterances sounded familiar to you? In 
	what way these words were different from those of Begum Zia-Nizami, general 
	Zia or general Ershad etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; All educational institutions including 
	Universities in Dhaka and other divisional head quarters were declared 
	closed sine die by the government order. The government order asked the 
	students to vacate their Hall of residences and hostels by 8 p.m. to be more 
	precise. This order, not only inhumane but devoid of practical senses, put 
	thousands of students, male and female, in a most difficult situation which 
	can be appreciated only by the sufferers, none else, least by the 
	order-issuers. May I ask very politely to our very smart CA, ‘what would be 
	your reaction if in one fine morning our army chief appearing at the door 
	steps of your residence with his pistol pointing to you sir, asked you to 
	leave your residence within a couple of hours?’ The worst part of the 
	government action is it completely violated the autonomy of the university. 
	In this regard Government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed is no different from that 
	of General Zia, Ershad or and Begum Khaleda. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The basic 
	question why army or the government felt it necessary to set up an army camp 
	in the gymnasium of the university inside the campus. The University is not 
	a fortress corruption or terrorism. The academic community, teachers as well 
	as students have never welcomed the presence of police camp or any 
	disciplined forces. The presence of such camps has always been looked upon 
	as violation the sacred autonomy of the University. In our days we always 
	criticized government and university authority if Police, army (in rare 
	case) or BDR personnel entered the campus even with the permission the 
	university authority. The trouble of all governments is that they never 
	appreciated or respected University autonomy, a sacred creed of the Academic 
	community that ensures our freedom and cultivation freethinking. We consider 
	that presence of police or any other disciplined force is a threat to our 
	academic freedom and liberal thinking. Each and every government must be 
	aware of this sentiment of the academic community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From the reign 
	of Ayub Khan in Pakistani time to this day I witnessed variety of curfews 
	imposed on the public by the governments issuing the same statements ‘in 
	order to restore normal public life and protect public lives and 
	properties’. The present crisis is the creation of the ill governance of the 
	so called caretaker government fully backed by and guided by a set of army 
	generals (sitting as well as retired) and civil bureaucrats. If the 
	government could not control public reaction, in some cases may be of some 
	violent nature, with all its might drawn from Army, BDR and Police forces, 
	in a normal way then there must be some thing wrong in nature of governance.

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From simple 
	event of beating a DU student on Monday, August 20, 2007 at the playground 
	of the University by a member(s) of armed forces within the campus, the 
	resentment among the students of spread like fire. The matter is not a 
	skirmish between a member in uniform and the ill-fated student, but it is 
	more than that and very deep rooted. The attitude of the soldiers was of 
	masters, controlling and possession of power and authority. They are the 
	masters of the time. Please notice that the wide spread demonstration 
	against army and the government has not been an organized effort of the 
	leading students organizations. It was almost a spontaneous reaction among 
	the general students out bursting their resentments against the army and 
	army-controlled government of Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed. The government and its 
	army advisers failed to read this aspect of the sentiments of the students. 
	The Government and its friend &amp; philosopher, the army generals must 
	understand that whatever good works this government has done in dealing with 
	anticorruption and other areas, the academic community of the country, 
	particularly the teachers and students, by and large, cannot accept a 
	government for a long time which came into existence through the imposition 
	of emergency for whatever good reason it might be. If the government acts as 
	a government of national character with its own agenda to fulfill, instead 
	of acting as a caretaker and interim government for a specific period of 
	time within which it must held a free, fair and neutral election on the 
	basis of a fault free voters list updated from the last one. The EC is free 
	to take up any means including preparation of picture-affixed voters list to 
	ensure full proof casting of votes by all eligible voters. Beyond this if 
	the present government have any agenda this would definitely be beyond their 
	jurisdiction. No basic policy making decision(s) must be undertaken by the 
	government instead it would concentrate on good governance on routine 
	matters like law and order situation, keeping the price of daily commodities 
	within limit, supply of manures to the farmers, effective measures to flood 
	situations, supply of electricity and other amenities to the public. This 
	would be time consuming, a deviation from its main goal holding of election 
	in shortest and lead to indicate that this government has its own agenda for 
	the future. Already Barrister Moinul Hosain has indicated that apart from 
	routine governance his government is also a government of reformist. This 
	would definitely create resentment and criticism among the common men, more 
	particularly among the civil society, academic and intellectual communities. 
	It is clear that present government has no jurisdiction to bring in major 
	reform in the political, educational, industrial or economic field. It is 
	not a people’s government, though it might enjoy some support from the mass 
	for some of its good works. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The worst curfew 
	I witnessed in the dreadful night of March 25, 1971, again imposed by the 
	then Army in power in East Pakistan, which continued for three days, almost 
	uninterrupted. Under the cover of day and night curfew the Pakistani men in 
	uniform killed not less than 20 thousand civilians only in Dhaka city. Since 
	then general Zia led and general Ershad led Governments killed many innocent 
	peoples under the cover of curfews. I also remember the dreadful curfews 
	imposed by then army authority when the Bangabandhu was killed on the 
	dreadful morning of August 15, 1975 by a section of sitting army personnel. 
	I don’t want to see those curfews anymore or any curfew whatever mild it may 
	look like, particularly from the present government, which claimed it, is a 
	people’s government. Please prove this claim by your deeds and show your 
	concern for civil liberty, free press and fundamental rights. Yes, this is 
	my urgent appeal to you Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed, please restore my fundamental 
	and civil rights and withdraw the indefinite curfew because it has causing 
	harm to economic and commercial activities, worst than effect of <i>hartals</i>!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
