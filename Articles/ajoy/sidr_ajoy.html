	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">I 
	had been to southern part of, mainly the coastal areas recently in 
	Kolapara-Khepupara Upazila of district of Patuakhali, one of the most 
	devastated districts. The coastal belt we visited stretched from Kuakata in 
	the west to east along the sea cost for a few miles. We saw the devastated
	<i>jnapads</i> (roads) and <i>janas </i>(people). The condition of the 
	people is simply beyond description; honestly speaking my vocabularies 
	failed me to describe what I saw in my own eyes destruction and damage, the 
	cyclone, termed as SIDR (meaning the EYE in Ceylonese language) had caused. 
	We moved along the coast and land along the WAPDA built barrage in early 
	sixties. Most of the houses of the common men on both sides of the barrage 
	were collapsed or blown away by the accompanying tornado wind blowing not 
	less than 300 km per hour, trees, small or big were uprooted, the tidal bore 
	rose to 10 feet height over flowing the barrage causing damage of the 
	barrage severely (in many places it came down to ground level This sweeping 
	bore entered village after village causing damage of the paddy fields and 
	causing the fields and ponds saline with sea waters. I spent there 3 days 
	from 30<sup>th</sup> Nov – 3<sup>rd</sup> December making our relief head 
	quarter at Khepupara in a house of my very good friend Mr. Ushewe, a noble 
	Rakhain leader and a well to do family, who commands respect not only from 
	his own community but Bengalis too. When I entered his house with our relief 
	team I saw him living under almost an open sky. The Ushewe family has lost 
	every thing. His palatial and beautiful residence, a two-storied timber made 
	house overlooking a small river was submerged under tidal boar 5-6 feet 
	deep. This tidal bore with accompanying severely blowing wind caused damage 
	to his house and its premise surrounded with tall trees and natural bushes. 
	The family lost all their material belongings. He told us that just a day 
	before, the family moved back to a temporarily erected shelter in the 
	premise. Until that day the family took shelter in a hotel in Kolapara town. 
	The town itself was unimaginably damaged mainly to poor people and small 
	business community. The government gave Ushewe family two pieces of 
	tarpaulin with which he made a relief centre cum his office wherein we were 
	cordially invited on the afternoon 30<sup>th</sup> November, 2007 with a 
	broad smiling face and unfolded arms. His well rich library in Rakhain 
	literature and ancient Burmese manuscripts is totally damaged beyond 
	recover.</span></p>

	<b>Fig.1</b> Damaged Village</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Next 
	day we moved with sea trolley and boats along the coasts and canals or some 
	times with automobiles whenever possible on roads. During three days we 
	covered perhaps nearly thousand families. It was a shocking experience for 
	me. The extent of damage is simply unimaginable. The poor people have lost 
	everything, yes everything apart from loss of human lives. Every family, 
	every man has a horrifying story to tell. My very good friend made all the 
	arrangements for our visits to remote villages inhabited with Rakhain 
	people.&nbsp;&nbsp; We concentrated our relief work in the unions and villages where 
	Rakhains are living distributing relief materials to more than 1000 families 
	along the costal belt. Out of these 1000 families 300-350 families belong to 
	Rakhains and Christians (not more than 50) and rest are Muslim and a few 
	Hindu families (a fishing community). The fishing communities, whether 
	Hindus or Muslims were the worst sufferers. Mohimganj, a small river port 
	famous for production and export of dried fish of various kinds was washed 
	away. This resulted the business community, the fishermen and the laborers 
	put on starvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

	<b>Fig. 2.</b> We are taking few affected women to Mahimganj.</p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As I narrated 
	before most of the families living on both sides along WAPDA built barrage 
	in early sixties lost their houses, cattle, fishes, and paddies. The ponds 
	and paddy fields became saline. As a result they cannot cultivate the next 
	crop, <i>a kind of dal</i>. How long and how many rainy seasons would these 
	lands require for desalination is any body’s guess. Most crises are the 
	scarcity of drinking water as most of the ponds have become unusable. There 
	had never been any tube well system in the localities (shallow or deep). The 
	people of those localities have asked us for a few tube wells on emergency 
	basis. Many school structures and furniture are either damaged or washed 
	away. I visited <i>two schools</i> one a non-government primary school, located in 
	a Christian village and another a secondary school in a Muslim village near Kuakata. Apart from material damage of the schools, boys and girls have lost 
	books and other education materials. I felt so helpless among them and so 
	small. </font></p>
