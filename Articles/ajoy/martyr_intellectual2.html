  of his colleagues in the university but very much dedicated to the cause of
  war of liberation that was going on from March to December, helping the
  freedom fighters from within keeping a low profile, a very difficult job
  indeed. But he could not keep secret of his real identity from the watchful
  eyes of his collaborator colleagues within IER. During non-cooperation
  movement or ’69 mass movement he had been always with us in our little
  effort to strengthen the nation wide movement for autonomy rapidly turning
  into a movement of independence under the charismatic leadership of

  luminary in our literary and cultural world needs no introduction. Who could
  imagine that his Islamist students belonging to Al Badr bahini would pick up a
  great personality like him ? His only fault that he believed in Bengali
  identity of ours and worked for it. This is annoying for the fundamentalists
  as Munir Bhai had tremendous influence over his students and university
  colleagues. Once a dedicated theoretical communist turned into a liberal
  democrat Munier Choudhury was known for his liberal and secular views - the
  views he propagated through his notable writings and lectures. He was a great
  orator who could mould, charm and hypnotize his listeners.&nbsp;<o:p>

  Dhaka Central Jail (1953-54) during our language movement he did his M. A

  university.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">After
  the army crackdown in the university area in which he luckily escaped like
  many, he moved to his parent’s house, near Hatirpool. He became a totally
  dejected and broken man. Many of his student-like well-wishers requested him
  through our channel to come to liberated areas and work with us. But
  unfortunately Munir Bhai couldn’t mentally adjust to flee from his beloved
  motherland. He preferred to stay back and surrendered to his ‘fate’ to
  which I personally believe he had no faith. When I reflect back-- the question
  still hunts me why Munir Bhai took such a decision while his younger son was a
  freedom fighter. It did pain me and even now I cannot forget it. We lost a
  great son of Bangladesh who could contribute much more to what he had already
  done in our cultural and literary arena. Son like Munier Choudhury born once
  in a century in a country like ours.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">His

  soft spoken and naturally shy, Mr. Choudhury could be killed by Al Badrs was
  beyond imagination. He was not an activist in any sense, nor was he a publicly
  known figure- even then the Al Badr Bahini picked him up on 14<sup>th</sup>
  December from his residence where he was hiding. It is now known that Al Badrs
  came to his residence at Fuller Road area and forcibly took his mail servant
  who was looking after the house during their absence. The servant could not
  bear the torture any more who was forcibly carried to his hiding place.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">Mr.
  Choudhury was my neighbour just living opposite to my residence before the
  dreadful night of 25<sup>th</sup> March. Then we dispersed on 27<sup>th</sup>
  March immediately after the curfew was withdrawn. He was so kind hearted that,
  knowing that I had not much acquaintances or relatives in Dacca he offered me
  to accompany them which I politely declined as I did not want to put him in a
  more dangerous situation in keeping me with him an activist like me and that
  too a Hindu.&nbsp;<o:p>

  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">Mr.
  Choudhury, born in Noakhali in 1926, joined department of Bangla in 1955. He
  studied at London University for couple of years in linguistics. He was
  awarded ‘Sahitya Bharati’ by the Viswa Bharati University, Santiniketan.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">How
  could I forget him? I owe my life to him. He saved me from the probable
  onslaught at the hands of the Pakistani bahini. I was then hiding in a
  residential flat of a good friend of mine at Dhanmondi some time in the first
  week of April. A military zeep came at about 2-30 pm with some army officials.
  They enquired to my host who happened to be a medical practitioner whether a
  professor of DU was hiding here. He some how managed to impress upon them that
  no such person was residing in his residence. In fact I was not staying within
  his flat, but to an adjacent small flatlet behind but adjacent to the main
  building. My friend advised me that it would not be safe for me to stay there
  as the army might come back if they had positive information. We decided that
  best safe place would be, for to night at least, my university quarter.
  Because before coming over here the army<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>must had checked with my original residence. Just before the curfew was
  re-imposed in the evening I quietly moved to the university flat unnoticed- a
  barren, deserted and dreadfully calm place then. But Dr. Murtaza, who lived
  just opposite to my flat on the ground floor, noticed my arrival from his
  window. Immediately he came to my place knocking the door with a whispering
  voice asking me to open the door. I didn’t put on any light. He advised me
  to leave the place the earliest moment, preferably early in the morning
  tomorrow as soon as the curfew was lifted. When I argued that when he could
  stay here why should I not. He replied that he was not that activist, - he was
  primarily a Maoist theoretician plus he was a medical doctor. He further
  advised me that so long I could not move to a safer place, I must not get out
  of the flat he would do the necessary domestic things. He also asked one of
  his aids to find me a place of safety. I left the flat a couple of days later
  to a new hiding place.&nbsp;<o:p>

  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; tab-stops: 191.25pt">But
  alas, the doctor could not hide his own identity from the watchful eyes of the
  Pakistani collaborators. They new that the gentleman under the disguise of an
  innocent doctor was helping the cause of our liberation by treating the
  injured guerillas operating within the city and supplying emergency medicines
  to the freedom fighters.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Who thought a subdued and
  mild natured innocent boy, a potentially brilliant teacher were be a sacrifice
  at the alter of our independence. How could we pardon these war criminals ?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;But we did, and failed
  to bring those war criminals to justice. Not only that, the day might be
  awaiting for us when those demons would have to be praised or worshiped for
  trying to save disintegrating Pakistan. Why not, if collaborators could today
  share power within the government is it an utopian thought ?&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Son of a famous and
  traditional Bramhin family of a village just on the other side river Buriganga-
  a village called Yantrail, Shree Santosh Bhattacharyya was born on 30<sup>th</sup>
  August, 1915. The family was very much known for its Sanskritic learning and
  studies. He passed B. A. (Hons.) and M. A. in history from Dacca University n
  1937 and 1938 respectively. After serving as a professor of history in JN
  college for over 10 years he subsequently joined history department of DU as a
  lecturer in History in 1949. He became Senior lecturer after a few years.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Santosh Babu, as he was
  popularly known among his friend circles, was known for his scholarship
  particularly in the discipline of ancient Indian history, Sanskrit language
  and literature. He had a powerful pen in English as well as in Bangla. He was
  an expert of Maurian period of Indian History with special expertise in
  Chanakays’ works including ‘Kautilya’s Arthasastra’ (Poltical and
  Economical treatise of Kautilya).</p>

  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">After the army crackdown in
  the dreadful night of 25<sup>th</sup> March, Santosh Babu moved to his village
  home in order to escape army assault. He had seen his own eyes the ferocity of
  army operation. But he dared not stay back in his home because as per
  directives of the army order he had to join the university as a loyal citizen
  and returned to his university residence within the campus. His friends failed
  to induce him that to stay in the campus was not safe for him. They further
  requested him to cross over to India to which Mr. Bhattacharyya declined
  saying ‘I shall not leave my motherland, why should I ? I have not done
  anything wrong.’ He had to pay for his decision.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On The 14th December together
  with his other colleagues, Al Badrs picked him up from his Isa Khan residence.
  His disfigured body was discovered by his friends from the Rayer Bajar killing
  spot.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Santosh Bhattacharyya was my
  respected teacher in Dacca Hall. I had greatest respect and love for him. He
  was our house tutor from 1954-1957. He was a very lovable person with open
  heart. He could mix with his students very freely irrespective of their age
  and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>difference in cultural and

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Dr. Siajul Haque Khan was
  born in 1924 in the district of Noakhali. He graduated in Education in 1949
  and then he obtained M. Ed degree from IER, DU in 1965. Later on he obtained
  Ed. D from the State College of Colorado, USA in 1967 after which he joined
  IER, DU as a senior lecturer in the following year.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Honestly speaking, I had only
  nodding acquaintance with him as a neigbour living in the same area within the
  campus.&nbsp;<o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">A group of Al Badr members
  took him forcibly in a bus in the morning of 14<sup>th</sup> December to an
  unknown destination from where he did never return to his beloved family. The
  brutal collaborators killed him, yes killed this fine and honest
  straightforward gentleman. The barbarous Pakistani army were kicked out of the
  sacred soil of Bangladesh, but the left over collaborators of theirs not only
  successfully survived and flourished following the historic tragic event of
  1975 but occupied the seat of power now centering our great lady Madam Zia.&nbsp;<o:p>

  failed to carry the true message of war of liberation and independent Bangla
