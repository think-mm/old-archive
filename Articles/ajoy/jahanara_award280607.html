	Honourable Mr. President,</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">In the 
	beginning of my statement I remember Shahid Janani with immense gratitude. 
	The movement she started years ago did not reach its successful end. It was 
	not her failure; it is ours that we could not continue the movement with 
	momentum. My sorrow that lies in the fact that the great rajakar Golum Azam 
	smile with open teeth even today, he enjoys participating in the invitation 
	offered in the embassies. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. MA 
	Hasan delivered toady the memorial lecture. In here he discussed in detail 
	the complicated process involved in trials associated with genocide. On the 
	one hand he drew our attention as well as that of government of the 
	problems, he also discussed the ways to overcome those problems fairly in 
	details. You have heard him, so it is no point of repeating. But the point 
	Dr. Hasan stressed is the importance of collecting evidence of genocide, if 
	we want to hold trial at the national or international level. Unfortunately, 
	no government took the matter with due importance. As a result many 
	important documents or evidence were lost, many died in the meanwhile who 
	could have been important witnesses. Whatever evidence has been collected it 
	has been done by the private organizations or individuals. Many of you 
	probably do not know that Dr. Hasan has been devoting himself in this work 
	for the last few years silently. I believe that once a trial is initiated 
	against these war criminals these documents of his would be of immense 
	value. Please come on and give him a loud applause through clapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	Medal</i> 2007, and I am invited to receive the award on behalf the <i>
	Muktomona.</i> It is a great honour in deed for the members of the Muktomona 
	and for me too. I am greatly elevated. On behalf of myself and the Muktomona 
	we thank you respected president, and express our gratitude. We do not know 
	if we are worthy of receiving such an honour which is associated with a 
	great lady of our time, but this recognition inspire us immensely. With due 
	solemnity and humbleness I on behalf of thousands of members and 
	well-wishers of Muktomona am receiving the great honour. Mr. President thank

		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		In order to save humanity against blasphemy we started worldwide 
		movement to save the life of prisoner of the free thinker Dr. Yunus 
		Sheikh. Our active co fighters were: IHEU, Rationalist International, 
		Amnesty International, Dhaka Rationalist and Secularist Union and the 
		‘Save Dr. Yunus Shaikh Committee’ organized by Dhaka based members of 
		Muktomona under the leadership Professor Ajoy Roy, who day after day 
		make movements at the street, held meetings, procession, seminars, road 
		side demonstration and staged demonstration against Pakistani president, 
		General Pervez Musharaff in front of the Pakistan High commission. Many 
		progressive people and intellectuals including Professor Kabir Choudhury 
		and Justice Sobhan took leading part in the movement. The success cane. 
		Dr. Sheikh was released from Pakistani jail. He is now in UK and since 
		then he is an active member of MM.</font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We build up movement in favour of Shariar Kabir for his release when he 
		was arrested by the Begum Khaleda-Nizami led BD government at the Dhaka 
		airport on the false charge of treason against the country. Herein also 
		we met with success as a result of combined movement of national and 
		international organizations and civil society.</font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We once again joined hands in making a wide spread movement in securing 
		release of Shariar Kabir (2<sup>nd</sup> time), Muntasir Mamun and host 
		of others including some journalists and human rights volunteers who 
		were persecuted by Bangladesh on false charges of terrorism, treason and 
		what not. Once again we met with success.</font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We almost single handedly organized a network based agitation in favour 
		of ‘Proshika’ in securing the release of its workers and employees 
		including the Proshika chief. In this movement we got the support of AI 
		and similar other organizations. </font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We always raise our voice very loudly against communal persecution, the 
		worst expression of communal fundamentalism.</font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		In a similar way when the communal forces in 2001 let loose by the 
		Khaleda-Nizami by its persecution on minorities of Bangladesh such as 
		killings, lootings, setting of fire on houses and professional 
		establishments, destruction and violation of sanctity of places of 
		worships set historical example- we stood against the evil forces in 
		collaboration with country’s secular forces. Our founder adviser 
		Professor Ajoy Roy with local Muktomonas and intellectuals did build up 
		a strong movement against the evil forces of communalism and 
		fundamentalism under the banner ‘Committee for Preservation of Citizens’ 
		Rights and Resistance to Communalism’. The Committee formed a ‘Public 
		Inquiry Commission’ with Professor Zillur Rahman Siddiq as its chairman, 
		which published its report in December 2002 that was immediately 
		publicized through out the world through our website 
		‘www.mukto-mona.com/human-rights/. A group of leading expatriate 
		intellectuals sent letters of protest to the then Prime minister Begum 
		Khaleda Zia and President Dr. Badruddoza Choudhury urging them to stop 
		this inhuman act of barbarism against the minorities. They expressed 
		their indignation against the communalists being nurtured by the 
		government. Muktomona made a signature campaign internationally 
		protesting the inaction on the part of the government and the protest 
		letter was sent to the PM and the President. </font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We do note make simply theoretical movement. We stand by the side of 
		oppressed humanity materially and physically too, wherever the 
		persecution takes place. We came forward on the side of persecuted 
		minority families of villages Annada Prasad and Fatemabad in Bhola and 
		took part in the programme of rehabilitation, initiated by our sister 
		organization ‘Drishtipat’. Under the programme we took up construction 
		of low cost houses for 100 displaced families, leasing of agricultural 
		lands to the needy and persecuted families, educational support to the 
		young boys and girls etc.. We came forward to stand on the side of 
		Purnima, Rita, Madhuri, Rajkumar babu, Narahari Kabiraj, John, Sitansu 
		Murmu, Fatema, Minati, ... how many names I would name, .. all of them 
		were the victims of the beastly oppression committed by the beasts in 
		human form.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We stood by the side of the family of journalist Manik Shaha when the 
		dedicated journalist fell victim to the terrorist force. We extended our 
		hand of co-operation to sustain the education of his two daughters. We 
		stood on the side of journalist Bibhuranjan Sarkar</font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We came forward to the side of humanist Shariar Kabir, Kazi Mukul and 
		their colleagues when they met a serious road accident with our very 
		little resource. We stood by the side of the family of Dr. Humayun Azad 
		at the time of the crisis. We helped to create a Humayun Aazd Foundation 
		initiated by his family.</font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		On the bed of mighty river Brahamputra in a char island we reconstructed 
		a flood demolished lower secondary school. We took up the responsibility 
		of running the school with our small resources. We have undertaken to 
		construct a small construction in memory of the local martyrs in our 
		liberation war. In this connection we held a public meeting of the local 
		freedom fighters and in their presence a building slab was placed.</font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We appealed to Bangladesh caretaker government for prosecuting the 
		killers of Cholesh Richil&nbsp; and also made donation to help his 
		family members. </font></li>
		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		We condemned or made petitions against oppressions and persecutions 
		against minority Hindu, Quadiyani and other ethnic communities in 
		Bangladesh; targeted killings of minority Muslims in Gujarat, India, 
		oppressions of Palestinians and others. We made statements against the 
		infamous River Interlinking Project in India, protested against Kansat 
		killings, showed concern against the vandalism on renowned artist M F 
		Hussain’s Paintings, condemned Jamaat-Shibir's death threats to Zafar 
		Iqbal and Hasan Azizul Huq, appealed to save the honor of Valerie 
		Taylor, the founder of CRP&nbsp; or condemned angry attacks and fatwas 
		on Salman Rushdie&nbsp; and Taslima Nasrin.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></li>
