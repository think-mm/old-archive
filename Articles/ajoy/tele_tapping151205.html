	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Not 
	satisfied with clumsy handling of Islamic fundamentalism in its worst form 
	appearing in Bangladesh the Khaleda-Nizami four party alliance government 
	has the luxury of opening yet another front- “The Promulgation of 
	Presidential Order” to choke the throat of the people whom government don’t 
	like” in the name of national security, upholding the ‘Bhabmurti’ (image) of 
	Bangladesh. About two years back, the government asked the ministry of Post, 
	Telephone, Telegraph &amp; mass communication to amend the present Act so that 
	the amended act could be used to tap any one’s telephone at will. The 
	government also tried to censure individual e-mails. All these acts of 
	government indicate its attitude of intolerance, to individual’s freedom and 
	human right values. I wrote several articles in MM as well as other website 
	including ‘Drishtipat’ condemning the government attitude of controlling 
	everything a few years back. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">It 
	seemed government did not give up its fascist attitude to its people whom it 
	governs. Government kept everything in secret. Sensing that government out 
	of desperation and being bewildered what to do, it might in the name of 
	public security and national security promulgate Presidential Order to tap 
	public and private telephones, a group of human right activist and 
	intellectuals including myself issued a press statement urging the 
	government to stop it on December 10, 2005. Apparently the order is 
	promulgated to curb the recent violent and militant bomb explosions let 
	loose by the Jamati led Islamic fundamentalists. And our puppet President 
	Prof. Iyajuddin Ahmed seems to have not a bit of conscience, and does 
	whatever his master Lady Khaleda says him to do. Shame he was a professor 
	too of DU ! We, in our statement, pointed out that such PO enabling to tap 
	individual’s telephone is gross violation of human rights, and fundamental 
	rights guaranteed in our constitution. We further said that this would be 
	used against opposition party activists, human right activist, free thinkers 
	and liberal democrats. The prominent signatories were- Prof. Khan Surwar 
	Murshid, Prof. Zillur Rahman Siddiqui, Dr. Anisuzzaman, Prof. Ajoy Roy, 
	Prof. Mujaffar Ahmed, Dr. Anowar Husain, Dr. Hamida Husain, Prof. Hayat 
	Mahmud .. .. . (see
	<a href="http://www.prothom-alo.net/v1/2005-12-11/11cat5.html">Prothom Alo, 
	December 11, 2005</a>).</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">But 
	little respect does the President or PM have for righteous voices of 
	respected intellectuals. On Sunday, December 11, 2005 at night, the 
	President at the order of PM Khaleda Rahman promulgated the PO, which would 
	empower the home minister and its office and allow, at the instance of home 
	ministry, the law enforcing agencies, various sections of intelligence 
	officials to tap telephonic conversations of any individual(s). This is a 
	shear encroachment on the part of the government to enter one’s bedroom. 
	Present Bangladesh Telecommunication Act 2001 not only prohibits it, but if 
	taping is done by any agency it constitutes an offence under this act. It is 
	like a sword, which might fall any time on anyone if government so desires, 
	as our intelligence or law enforcing agencies carry out the desire of PM. 
	Although the amended Act in the form of PO is intended to be applied to 
	individuals after obtaining previous permission of the chief executive of 
	the interior ministry, meaning the half minister Mr. Babar. The one of the 
	outward reason for making such a move to ask the President so hurriedly is 
	that government feels that because of large scale telephone network 
	spreading throughout Bangladesh, more particularly mobile telephone system 
	which is being used by the terrorists for their ill plan to execute. This 
	argument is a shear nuisance. The promulgated PO immediately takes effect 
	and foolish government thinks it will help combat criminal activities 
	particularly associated with explosive devices used by the Jamat supported 
	Islamic militants. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	promulgation is made on the day when the government and human rights 
	organizations are observing “Human Rights Day”. And we are only a few days 
	ahead of our Victory day, December 16. Indeed what a befitting gift for us 
	from Begum Khaleda’s government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
	taped conversation may be produced as evidence in the court. At present 
	phone taping is an offence under the existing Bangladesh Telecommunication 
	Act 2001; the section 71 (b) of the act clearly says that violation of the 
	act constitutes a punishable offence prescribing imprisonment of <u>maximum 
	six months</u> and or a <u>fine not exceeding Tk 50,000</u> for the 
	offender, whoever he is including member of the intelligence departments.

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">The

	<ol style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt" start="1" type="1">

		service providers</u> must cooperate with the officials who are assigned 
		to tap and or record the telephonic conversations for
		<span style="color:red">the interest of national security</span>. It 
		also says that the service provider concerned shall make available to 
		use their facilities and infrastructure free of cost to complete the 
		mission taken by the assigned officials. The section concerned also 
		includes deletion of a provision to give compensation to the 
		telecom-service providers in case government decides to suspend their 
		service by an order. This new section provides that government can 
		authorize an official of intelligence agency, national security 
		intelligence, investigating organization or person to tap and collect 
		conversation, and to resist the phone service operators from sending 
		message and conversation in the interest of ‘national security’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana">
		The section 97 (2) of the existing act requires that if Rastrapati

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;text-align:justify">
	<font face="Verdana">On the other hand the current Order, promulgated by the

	amend any license/ certificate/ permit issued under this act, or suspend any

	lady PM is sufficient to kill yours and mine’s individual freedom and

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">One 
	positive side of the PO is that Khaleda-Nizami’s pro Islamic government now 
	categorically admits that ‘law and order situation is in danger; state and 
	national security are at stake.’ Persecution of minorities (and still 
	continuing) of all shades following 2001 general election, killing and 
	abducting of business elites, persecution of political opponents- even 
	killing of elite politicians, harassment, persecution, even killing of 
	intellectuals including University and college teachers, social workers and 
	cultural personalities and not to speak of journalists, grabbing of business 
	establishments and properties by the powerful mastans of the localities with 
	the blessings of BNP from the weaker sections of the people which includes 
	Hindu minorities and tribal too, unchallenged tyranny on the womenfolk in 
	the name of fotwabazism etc. are the characteristic features of 
	Khaleda-Nizami led four party government’s good&nbsp; governance. Khaleda’s

	Advocate Abdul Matin Khasru, erstwhile law minister opined that it will 
	harass the people saying, “The ordinance is ultra vires to the constitution 
	being violation to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the article 43(b)”. 
	‘This would violate privacy’, the advocate commented. Dr. Zahir, a leading 
	lawyer of the Supreme Court said, “It will definitely hamper people’s right 
	to privacy and there is a possibility of its misuse.” Barrister Roknuddin 
	Mahmud also opined that it would be misused. Kazi Feroz Rashid, a former 
	telecommunication minister in Ershad’s regime opined the PO is a violation 
	of human rights. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">There 
	are a few, like Ex IGP Modabbir Choudhury’s opinion that it might retard 
	crime activities, if properly used. Another retired IGP Mr. Shahajan 
	commented that it must not be used in the interest of the ruling party and 
	interested individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">A 
	leading cello phone operator opined that, might be around few hundreds using 
	the system for evil purpose, but for them one can not punish or penalize 8 
	million innocent users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Verdana">Professor Ajoy Roy, an eminent 
	scientist and educationist expressed his reaction over the promulgation of 
	PO amending the existing Telecommunication Act, as an encroachment over an 
	individual’s privacy, a fundamental right of an individual, an impingement 
	of civil liberty and it constitutes an infringement of basic human rights 
	guaranteed in human rights declaration of UNO and also in our Constitution. 
	“This is an example how an autocratic government reacts when it fails to 
	provide good governance to the country”, said the learned professor. He 
	charged the government for turning Bangladesh a police state terming the 
	present government as tyrannical, fascist and autocratic having no respect 
	for liberty, democracy and tolerance. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Sayed 
	Manjurul Islam, a DU professor of English, commented that the move was 
	simply a violation of human rights and an expression of government’s evil 
	intention to oppress dissident views. “The government’s sincerity is enough 
	for containing militancy, there is no need to tap telephone conversation.”, 
	he contented. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Professor Sirajul Islam Coudhury, a leading educationist and a writer, 
	feared that the ordinance would be abused to blackmail and harass innocent 
	people. He opined that it would endanger the civil liberty. Instead of 
	wholesale taping telephones the government could do it for a particular 
	criminal if he is suspected of doing criminal activities including bomb 
	explosions. “Why innocent people will suffer for a handful of criminals ?”, 
	he posed the question. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">Adhikar, 
	a human rights organization in a statement said that the promulgation of the 
	PO was a violation of section 43 of the constitution wherein individual 
	civil liberty has been guaranteed. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText2"><font face="Verdana">It is learnt that at the 
	instance of PM’s desire, the taping of telephones would extend to top 
	political leaders, dissident BNP members and MPs, retired bureaucrats, 
	lawyers, businessmen and even foreign diplomats, especially those of UK, 
	India and European countries. Even the relatives and friends of top 
	political leaders would not be spared from the network. Already government 
	agencies are having talks with directors of different mobile telephone 
	companies in this regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">It may 
	be recalled that post and telecommunication ministry, at the desire of 
	Khaleda Begum and her coalition partners, proposed the amendment as it feels 
	that due to the wide availability of mobile phones, the criminals are using 
	them to facilitate criminal activities, thus posing a threat to national 
	security and law and order. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana">What a

	wonder.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
