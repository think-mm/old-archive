  Ahmedabad, Gujrat has found refuge and shelter in Kolkata (Calcutta).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>West Bengal, more particularly Calcutta once again proved most liberal
  state and a humanist city. When Islamic fundamentalists led by Jamatis were
  after the neck of Taslima Nasrin for her courageous anti-fundamentalist
  writings, we secularists at Dhaka did not dare to give her protection, but
  Calcutta offered her the necessary asylum at the time of her most critical
  days. When in 1971, Pakistani barbaric soldiers fell on intellectuals, AL
  leaders and workers and common mass in general, the state of Wes Bengal opened
  her border for the fleeing mass from occupied Bangladesh. The people of West
  Bengal extended rare hospitality to not less than 10 millions Bengalis. Credit
  must be given to the people of West Bengal.</span></p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">Remember Kutubuddin of Ahmedabad.
  During those fateful days of riot in March 2002. a picture was published in
  all leading dailies India – a young Muslim youth begging for his life to the
  rioters with folded hands. The picture of him with folded hands, tears
  streaming down his cheeks made him internationally known as a symbol of
  terror-stricken face of the Gujrat riots as the news was internationally
  circulated with the picture. Since then both the riot mongers and the
  journalists have haunted him. He has been hiding from one place to another in
  Gujrat. He then fled to neighboring state Maharastra. Even there he was
  haunted, and he could not find a safe shelter.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">West Bengal
  government, led by Budhadev Basu decided to offer Kutubuddin and his family a
  safe shelter in Kolkata. Under the initiative of Mr. Mohammad Selim, a veteran
  leader of CPM and minister in charge of the secretariat dealing with
  development of minority communities Kutubuddin was brought to Kolkata with his
  lovely young wife, a 3 years old lively daughter, and the little son Zishan
  yesterday, 9<sup>th</sup> August. As the Geetanjali Express arrived at the
  Howrah railway station, hosts of people received the family wishing them a
  happy new life. After about 15 minutes Kutubuddinn clad with a gray coloured
  check shirt carrying his daughter on his lap and borkha clad Tahera, wife of
  Kutubuddin, with her one-year-old son Zishan on her lap stepped out from the
  train. A two room flat has been hired for them at 5/2, Tiljala Road in Park
  Circus, a predominantly Muslim locality in Kolkata, and a tailor shop for
  Kutubuddin has also been provided to help him stand on his own feet. A West
  Bengal government’s Tatea Sumo automobile brought them to their new home
  from the station and their new neighbours welcomed the newly arrived guests
  cheering, ‘<i>Welcome, Kutubuddin Ansari</i>’ as they stepped in their new
  home. The door of the flat was decorated with flowers and written <i>Welcome
  Kutubuddin Ansari</i>. Ansaris broke into tears.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">“I am
  here with lots of dreams” (<i>Hum yahan bahut sapneke leke aaye hain</i>),
  said Ansari to the awaiting journalists. In the afternoon they were found more
  relaxed and a bit secured as he sat at the roof of their four storied building
  with his wife at his side and daughter on his lap as they faced the over
  enthusiastic journalists. In an answer to a query he said, “I am confident
  that whatever happened to me in Gujrat never happen in here.”</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">When asked
  why he has moved to West Bengal, the man answered- “Only people of Calcutta
  responded to an appeal published in the magazine <i>Communalism Combat</i>
  seeking help my relocation and rehabilitation.” Since his arrival to Kolkata
  only time he was seen with his well known folded hand posture when he said,
  “I have nothing to do with politics.....<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I just want to lead a peaceful life here with my family.... And I hope
  that what happened to me happens to none.”</span><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">He further
  said, “ The picture you saw of mine repeatedly made my identity known. And I
  lost jobs again and again. I want peace now.” He was a tailor at Ahmedabad,
  informed Ansari and he wants to do the same job here for his livelihood. About
  Gujrat he did not express any hatred or antagonism against his own people. He
  remarked with politeness, “Gujrat is good, but a few self interested people
  trying to make the state look bad.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">The West
  Bengal government however tried to apparently maintain an ‘official
  distance’ from the rehabilitation programme as is evident from the
  utterances of the CPM state secretary Mr. Anil Biswas. He said, “The Bengal
  Government is not providing shelter or employment to Kutubudddin Ansari as
  stated by the Gujrat government.” He however hastily added, “Some close
  friends of Ansari had contacted their friends in Calcutta and sought a shelter
  for him. It is true that our party members are also helping Ansari find a
  shelter in Calcutta, but the government is in no way involved in the
  process.” Mr. Biswas admitted, as reported by daily Telegraph, that Ansari
  was feeling insecure in Gujrat and so sought to move to Bengal. “Every
  citizen has the right to live and earn his livelihood in any state of the
  country and no one should play politics over the issue”, obviously hinting
  to the Gujrat state government. All these uncalled for explanations offered by
  Anil Biswas were aimed at not to get involved with any controversy with state
  government of Gujrat.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-US">BJP leader
  of the state Mr. Tathagata Roy has alleged that CPM is doing politics with the
  matter. There are many <i>Hindu Kutubuddin</i>s in Kashmir and Bangladesh. But
  the CPM had no headache for them. In reply to this allegation Anil Biswas of
  CPM said, “there is no politics with in-coming of Kutubuddin in West Bengal.
  The matter is entirely humanitarian issue. We know there are many incidents
  like this one. But it is not possible always to do even if we wished.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-spacerun:

  Bengal People for their liberal generosity. I sincerely hope other states of
  India follow the example of West Bengal.<span style="mso-spacerun:
