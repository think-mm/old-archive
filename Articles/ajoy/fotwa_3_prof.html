  </tt>Our Prime minister whenever visits a foreign country proudly says that 
  ours is a moderate Muslim country. The fundamentalism or telabanism has no 
  place in our sociopolitical life. Although we are not secular, because 
  secularism is taboo in Islam, we are more than secular measured by any 
  yardstick. In our constitution there is no mention of minority communities- 
  ethnic, religious, cultural or linguistic, so there is no minority problem or 
  minority repression. Since there exists no minority population how come 
  question of minority repression arises. These are all false and baseless 
  propaganda of Begum Khaleda’s political enemies chiefly engineered by AL 
  goondas and mastans. We are all Bangladeshis, followers of Islam and Sunnah.<font face="Arial"><tt><font face="Arial"><br>
  <br>
  Even Ahmedias, a prominent and enlightened sect of Islam would not be 
  tolerated to exist. It is our solemn duty to bring them back to true fold of 
  Islam the Sunni, otherwise they would be eliminated. We would occupy their 
  place of worships, proscribe and burn their religious scriptures.<br>
  <br>
  Her ministers like ferestas (angels) having no conscience of their own echo 
  what Her Excellency utters or asked them to utter. Madam PM says there is no 
  terrorists in Bangladesh except a large number AL brand whom she has promised 
  to deal with with her Kobras, RATs and of course other members of law 
  enforcing agencies. She knows that her alliance partners headed by Jamat I 
  Islamia are most secular brand of Islamists and not fundamentalists. She 
  forgets that her Islamic partners are avowedly dedicated to establish an 
  Islamic republic in Bangladesh replacing the democratic system of Peoples 
  Republic of Bangladesh, which originally envisaged a liberal secular 
  democratic set up. She also forgets that her fundamentalist coalition 
  alliances declared many a times that they would replace our national anthem 
  ‘Sonar Bangla’, composed by a non believer poet of India by some thing like 
  ‘Pak sad bad ….’, and declared jihad to the effect ‘Bangla hobe Telaban’ (We 
  will make Bangladesh a taleban).<br>
  <br>
  So under this backdrop when three Dhaka University teachers, believed to be 
  liberal and secular, are once again threatened to be eliminated by the 
  Islamist fundamentalists, I don’t get surprised. It is learnt that two 
  fundamentalist groups belonging to what they called themselves ‘Nastik o 
  Murtad Protirodh Kamiti’ (Committee to resist atheists and Murtads) and Muslim 
  Millat Shariff Council sent letters of threat to Dhaka University Vice 
  Chancellor declaring three teachers name Dr. Humayun Azad of Bnagla 
  department, Dr. Muntasir Mamun of History department and Professor MMM Akash 
  of Economics department terming them as atheists. Such letters of threat were 
  also sent to some presses. The two organizations, perhaps working in collusion 
  with each other pronounced death sentences to all of them. They were even not 
  given an opportunity to defend. This is the system of Islamic judiciary, this 
  brand of followers of Islam believes in. The letters alleged that Drs. Azad, 
  Mamun and Akash are engaged in anti Islamic anti Quaranic teaching to their 
  students which the letters termed as ‘Kufri’. Their teachings, says the 
  letters, are diminishing the values of Islam in the eyes of the students and 
  tarnishing the image of Islam. The letters urges to execute those teachers and 
  whoever carries out becomes a ‘jannatbashi’<br>
  <br>
  The Vice chancellor who is just an agent of the present BNP led government 
  admitted that his office had received such letters; he is aware of the 
  situation and taking appropriate action. The CID said yesterday in a 
  discussion meeting regarding law and order situation that department knew it 
  and not taking the matter lightly.<br>
  <br>
  It may be recalled that Dr. Humayun Azad just recovered following an attempted 
  murder injury for his anti fundamentalist writings a few months back. Dr. 
  Mamun a popular anti government columnist suffered humiliation including 
  arrest at the hands of the government about a year ago. He was arrested for 
  alleged anti-state activities. On the other hand Prof. Akash is a political 
  activist believing in Marxism and a member of politburo of CPB. It may be said 
  that whatever their individual political philosophy is all of them are secular 
  and anti-fundamentalist.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;</font></tt></font><p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-line-height-alt: 1.0pt">
  <font face="Arial"><tt><font face="Arial"><b>Reactions of Teachers</b><br>
  <br>
  Expressing his reaction over the declared punishments Dr. Muntasir Mamun 
  commented that had there been any effective government in the country no body 
  would have dared to issue such threats to university teachers. He further said 
  that Islam is a peace of religion. It has not permitted any individual or an 
  organization to declare any one a Murtad. Dr. Humayun Azad expressed his 
  reaction saying that this kind of fotwa proves that the country has become 
  inhabitable for peace loving citizens. He wondered how a group of 
  fundamentalists openly could threat to kill three university teachers while he 
  himself is still recovering from the deadly onslaught of the Islamic 
  fundamentalists just a few months back. It is the government’s responsibility 
  to silence these activists and fotowabazis, otherwise the Republic would soon 
  turn into an Al-Quida controlled state. Mrs. MM Akash said that such threat is 
  surely very alarming, and government should deal these anti social elements 
  with stern hand.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Arefin Siddiq and Professor Akhteruzzaman, president and secretary 
  of Dhaka University Teachers’ Association respectively deplored the threat to 
  three respected teachers, and asked for stern police action to round up office 
  bearers of those organizations.<br>
  <br>
  It may be recalled that in recent times Dhaka University teachers holding 
  liberal views have become targets of the fundamentalists. Professor Arefin 
  Siddiq, President of DUTA, its Secretary Dr. Akhteruzzama, Professor Aminur 
  Rashid, dean of the faculty of Science have been receiving threatening letters 
  and phone calls for their so called anti state activities. Recently Mrs. 
  Tarana Halim, a noted actress and an advocate was attacked in her own 
  residence by allegedly a group of fundamentalists, and two miscreants attacked 
  Mr. Anu Ahmed, professor of economics, Jahangir Nagar University. Surely all 
  these events are not isolated. One common factor among theses persons is that 
  they are non communal and secular. So the message is clear and sound.<br>
  <br>
  A few years back our beloved poet Shamsur Rahman was attacked by a group of 
  terrorists, who had been declared Murtat long ago. In this list of murtdas and 
  atheists included were Late Dr. Ahmed Sharif, Poet Shamsur Rahman, Prof. Kabir 
  Choudhury, Dr. Humayun Azad, Ms Taslima Nasrin, Poet Sayid Shamsul Haque, 
  Shariar Kabir, Dr. Ali Ashgar and many others including the present author.<br>
  <br>
  How dare these two fundamentalist organizations held open meeting in Dhaka 
  University Arts building. In the open meeting held on Sunday, 27th June, 
  presided over by one Mowlana Shafayet Ullah Jalali three teachers named above 
  were declared Murtads and punishment of death was pronounced. The meeting was 
  among others addressed by Mowlana Zakaria, Ekayedullah, Abdul Jabbar Fatehpuri, 
  Mufti Sahleh Ahmed, and Mufti Qudrat e Elahi, president of the Muslim Millat 
  Shariff Council. All were outsiders. The meeting charged these teachers with 
  Qufribad and attack on the Ulema-Alem samaj through their writings and 
  statements. In order to protect the values of Islam these teachers were 
  declared Murtad, and capital punishment was pronounced to be executed by 
  Islami devotees whenever opportunity comes. The accused were however given 3 
  months time during which they would say towba to Allah; and every day they 
  would pray five-time namaj in a mosque, read Quaran and Hadis regularly, and 
  declare openly that henceforth they would engage themselves in the 
  construction of Islamic Society, and then they might be pardoned. If they fail 
  to comply with orders, they would be simply executed. What the University 
  authority and intelligent department were doing, when outsiders were holding 
  long meeting and uttering filthy language of threats to its own teachers !<br>
  <br>
  Readers, look here, in an Ayatullah Khomeni style, these fundamentalists dare 
  to declare threat of killing university teachers openly. They have committed a 
  crime under Bangladesh penal code by openly saying their intention to kill 
  honorable citizens of the country. Should not the government and its police 
  and intelligent department take actions to round them up. Government is very 
  prompt to bring in sedition charge to harass important citizens, but miserably 
  fails to protect them from the clutches of the fundamentalists. Journalist 
  Humayun Kabir Balu of Khulna is the latest example of government’s utter 
  failure to combat the terrorism in an effective way.</font></tt></font><p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-line-height-alt: 1.0pt">&nbsp;<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-line-height-alt: 1.0pt">
