  </p>
  <p>The world-renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawkins in
  an address of international conference on Wednesday, July 11, 2004 gave an
  indication to revise his thirty-year-old earlier opinion that black holes
  destroy everything that enters into them. In a Dublin seminar he would
  disclose his new thinking of black holes which might solve the so called ‘black
  hole paradox’, a crucial puzzle of modern physics, the problem that was
  generated from his own work.</p>
  <p>In simple language we may describe the formation of a celestial object
  called as black hole. It is believed that when a star is sufficiently massive,
  gravitational collapse may continue until the density is so high and gravity
  predominates to such an extent that a black hole results. Objects believed to
  be massive black holes have been found at the center of some galaxies- they
  appear to power very luminous objects such as quasars and active galactic
  nuclei. Matter and radiation cannot escape from a black hole due to its
  immense gravitational field, but as material falls towards it intense
  radiation is emitted.</p>
  <p>Although black holes are assumed to be some kind of monsters in the
  space-time swallowing every thing matter or radiation approaching near them in
  a frenzied cosmic feast. The physicists now a days think that rather than
  being a space menace these objects may be fundamental to the creation of
  galaxies. Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that not
  even light can escape, making them impossible to see. However, the staff that
  is being sucked into those massive cosmic vacuum cleaners could be ‘seen’.
  Anything that approaches a black hole is first torn apart by its immense
  gravitational and then forms a flat rotating disc that spirals into the hole.
  As the debris gets closer and closer to the mouth of the black hole it speeds
  up and the bits start to smash together. The material heats up due to this
  friction. When this happens around a black hole, x-rays are given off which we
  can detect. If the black hole is really very large and has lots of debris in
  the disc, then it can reveal itself as one of the brightest objects in the
  universe- a quasar.</p>
  <p>There are two main types of black holes- stellar and supermassive. Stellar
  sized black holes are the remnants of massive dead stars that have imploded.
  It is estimated that our galaxy contains millions of these stellar black
  holes. Supermassive black holes can have initial mass millions of times that
  of the Sun. It is believed that these massive holes lurk in the center of
  every galaxy and be integral to the way galaxies evolve. There may be mini
  black holes, smaller than atoms in volume but as massive as whole mountains.
  There are some black holes lying between stellar and supermassive. It is quite
  likely that some kind of objects might found in the universe having opposite
  characteristics of a black hole, which spewing out every matter and radiation
  into the universe. This is just another of the cosmic mysteries still awaiting
  a solution. Hawking’s new thinking The great physicist of our time Stephen
  Hawking recently said that what he thought about the behaviour of black holes
  30 years back is based on a key wrong argument. He said, “ I have been
  thinking about this problem for 30 years, but I now have the answer. What was
  the key argument at that time ? In 1976, he showed that when a black hole is
  formed, it radiates energy and starts loosing mass. This radiation gives no
  information about the matter inside the black hole, and once the hole
  disappears – all the information are lost with it. This brings in a serious
  paradox known as ‘black hole information paradox’. If information is
  totally lost it arises important practical and philosophical consequences. If
  this really happens, then ‘we could never be certain of the past or predict
  the future precisely. A lot of people therefore wanted to believe that
  information could escape from a black hole but they didn’t know how it could
  get out.’, commented the Lucasian Professor of mathematics at Cambridge to
  the BBC. He further continued that once a material body or radiation had
  fallen into a black hole ‘it has gone and lost for ever and the only
  information remained was its mass and spin.’ The professor claimed saying,
  “… some time ago I discovered that black holes are not that black after
  all. They give off what has been called ‘Hawking radiation’. Because of
  this emission black holes will lose mass and eventually evaporates completely.
  The Hawking radiation seemed to be random and featureless so it appeared that
  all information about what fell into a black hole was lost.” However this
  contradicts the laws of quantum physics, which describe the behaviour of the
  Universe at the smaller scale. These dictate that information can never be
  completely lost ! Hawking has not yet revealed the detail mathematical
  calculations of his new thinking, but some points have been come out in a
  seminar talk he gave at Cambridge. Gary Gibbons, a physicist of the University
  of Cambridge, who attended the seminar, said that Hawking’s newely defined
  black holes did not have a well defined “event horizon” that hid
  everything in them from the outside world. “It’s possible that what he
  presented in the seminar is a solution.”, Gary Gibbons told New Scientist
  magazine. This remind us of controversy between Chandrasekhar and Edington-
  who claimed that within the dense celestial bodies like white dwarf the
  quantum laws break down including the Pauli’s exclusion principle.</p>
  <p>For a long time astrophysicists including Hawking argued that the extreme
  gravitational fields of black holes somehow overturned the quantum laws. But
  now Stephen has dropped the idea.</p>
  <p>According to his new concept of black hole model these holes never
  completely destroy everything that falls in. Instead, they continue to emit
  radiation for extended periods, eventually open up to reveal the information
  within them. He explained ‘The black holes only appears to form but later
  opens up and releases information about what fell in, so we can be sure of the
  past and we can predict the future.’</p>
  <p>It may be recalled that Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicts
  that the collapse of starts can cause great distortion of space-time,
  resulting in the formation of black holes with such intense gravitational
  fields that even light cannot escape. The general theory further predicts that
  heavy moving objects (like collapsing stars) emit gravitational waves in the
  form of massless gravitons traveling at the speed of light – just like
  photons in case of electromagnetic waves. Their detection is one of the
  greatest challenges of experimental physics. If these are detected, the
  gravitational field can be explained in terms of an exchange mechanism and
  hence to confirm the unified theory of all forces. But still we have a long
  way to go !</p>
