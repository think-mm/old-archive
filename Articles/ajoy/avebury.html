	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Under the 
	initiative of UK Parliamentary Human Rights Group a one day conference was 
	held on June 17 in London entitled “<i><span style="COLOR: green">European 
	Human Rights Conference on Bangladesh : Extremism, Intolerance &amp; Violence</span></i>” 
	at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London University . 
	For the purpose of holding the conference an organizing committee named 
	“Bangladesh Conference 2005 Steering Committee” was constituted under the 
	chair of Lord Avebury who is also the Vice Chair of the UK Parliamentary 
	Human Rights Group (UK-PHRG). Apart from UK Parliamentary Human Rights 
	Group, many human rights groups throughout the world extended support to 
	this conference that includes School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS, 
	University of London), Minority Rights Group International, Ahmadiyya Muslim 
	Association (London), Centre for Research on Nationalism, Ethnicity &amp; 
	Multiculturalism (University of Surrey, England), Commonwealth Human Rights 
	Initiative (CHRI, UK office), Survival International, South Asian Solidarity 
	Group, European Bangladesh Forum, International Humanist &amp; Ethical Union (IHEU), 
	Liberation, Bangladesh Hindu Buddhists Christian Unity Council (UK), World 
	Sindhi Congress, National Coordinating committee for the Realization of 
	Bangladesh Liberation War Ideals and Trials of Bangladesh Criminals of 1971 
	(UK Branch), .. .. &amp; many other human rights organizations and many 
	prominent individuals such as Lord Dholakia as patron of the steering 
	committee, Baroness Northover, Sally Keeble MP, Tom Brake MP, Tony Baldry 
	MP, Simon Hufhes MP, Jeremy Corbyn MP, John Wilikinson MP, Gareth Thomas MP, 
	David Drew MP, Angela Watkinson MP, Piara Singh Khabra MP, Peter Bottomly 
	MP, Keith Vaz MP, Karen Buck MP, Ann Clwyd MP, Robert Evans MEP (Member of 
	the European parliament), Baroness Sarah Lundford MEP, Jean Lambert MEP and 
	many others.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The organizing 
	committee invited many human right organizations, human right defenders, 
	individuals, academicians, NGOs, secularists, Bangladesh Government 
	representatives, political sufferers, representative of persecuted minority 
	communities- ethnic, cultural, religious, sectarian .. to cover different 
	shades of opinions. To quote the opening remarks of Sir Eric, which reflects 
	the mind of the steering committee: “ The meeting has been carefully planned 
	to allow as many different points of view to be expressed as possible.” 
	Referring to the presence of strong team of representatives of Bangladesh 
	Government Sir Eric expressed hope that “<u>they will not only give the 
	conference an official viewpoint on the many allegations of violence, 
	persecution and discrimination which are likely to be made, but will also 
	take back these concerns to the authorities in Dhaka</u>.” </font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But in reality 
	the representatives of BD government did the opposite- they only played the 
	old broken record of Mrs. Khaleda Zia Rahman and her&nbsp;4-party alliance 
	Government of Bangladesh.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As the 
	conference started taking shape, the Bangladesh High Commissioner Mr. A H 
	Mofazzal Karim started campaigning that the aim of the conference was to 
	malign the Bangladesh, its government to tarnish the ‘image’ of Bangladesh 
	in the international community. He further charged that the organizers of 
	the conference were conspirators against Bangladesh. The BD HC took up the 
	matter very seriously, perhaps at the instruction of his Government, and 
	asked the Steering Committee to stop holding the conference. Failing to do 
	at the organization level the HC took up the matter with the foreign office 
	of the UK government to intervene and stop the conference. Failing to 
	achieve his goal, the HC then asked the Steering Committee chair to increase 
	the number of representatives to 20 instead of six to which the chairman of 
	the committee declined very politely. The conference was held strictly on 
	the basis of invitation. The HC as usual using BNP tactic forcibly tried to 
	push in unauthorized BNP supporters into the conference premises. The strict 
	SOAS guards, who did not allow any one to enter the place except the 
	invitees, foiled this. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify" align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The conference was a great success and it was 
	established conclusively that challenged faced by today’s Bangladesh 
	includes extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism, repression on secular 
	liberals, minorities of all sorts, political opponents, intolerance to 
	opposition views which sometimes takes form of police torture on protesting 
	masses (with special target to women) and rallies, violence and lawlessness, 
	extra judicial killings and police torture under police custody and 
	ineffectiveness on the part of government to deal with the conditions 
	obtaining in Bangladesh either willingly or because of its incapacity.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">During 
	the proceedings of the conference Bangladesh government representatives were 
	given ample time, scope and opportunity to defend the BD government’s 
	position and project the ‘official viewpoints’ of the Government. In trying 
	to do so these gentlemen cut very sorry figures and miserably failed, to the 
	utter dissatisfaction of Mrs.&nbsp; Khaleda Rahman and her government, impress or 
	convince the audience. Failing to project the government view and to impress 
	the conference as a whole, the BD High commissioner, to save his skin from 
	the rage of disgruntled BD PM Begum Khaleda, resort to falsification and 
	hate campaign against the conference organizers and its leaders. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
	Failing the carry out the instructions imposed on BD High Commissioner and 
	the delegates by the Bangladesh government to filibuster and disrupt the 
	conference proceedings, the Bangladesh government representatives led by Mr. 
	Karim, the BD HC in UK withdrew from post luncheon sessions of the 
	conference quietly. He hurriedly called a press conference at Brick Bane 
	lane, inhabited mostly by Bangladeshi people, in the afternoon attended by 
	mostly BNP supporters and pro government elements. In the press conference 
	Mr. Karim said that June 17 London conference on human rights in Bangladesh 
	“break up in disarray”. Once more he claimed that the purpose of the 
	conference was organized by a <u>group of persons conspiring against 
	Bangladesh</u> aiming to “<span style="COLOR: green">tarnish the image of 
	Bangladesh</span>” He further alleged that BD government representatives 
	were not given enough time and opportunity to put up their case before the 
	conference audience, further they were hackled by a section of the audience.
	</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">I 
	myself was present in all plenary sessions (in all there were three in pre 
	luncheon sessions). No speaker had been interrupted except when one was 
	found talking gross lies or citing false evidence against an established 
	fact(s). The learned chairs of every session were polite, respectful to the 
	speakers, and maintained strict neutrality &amp; discipline. I am sorry to say 
	the BD government failed to utilize the adequate time and opportunities were 
	provided with. BD Government must asked explanation for their poor 
	performance. I myself was a sympathetic &amp; patient listener to what were BD 
	government representatives’ version of the events of human right violations 
	committed and still being committed against the 
	religious-ethnic-cultural-sectarian minorities of Bangladesh and extremism 
	of violence and Islamic fundamentalism. They spoiled their time by arguing 
	against the very theme of the conference and each one challenging the 
	legality of such a conference being held at London and trying to prove that 
	organizers were evidently biased, and giving his unnecessary, superfluous 
	introduction etc.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">On 
	June 19, 2005 Lord Eric Avebury, chair of the conference and vice chair of 
	the ULPHRG, issued a press statement in order to clarify and refute the 
	false allegations made by the Bangladesh High Commissioner in a press 
	conference held by him on June 17, 2005 in the after noon. In the press 
	statement Sir Eric in a very clear term said that the His Excellency BD HC 
	Mr. Karim had made a false statement on the proceedings of the conference 
	thus depicting him a “liar”. </font></p>

		<h5>Ref: European Human Rights Conference on Bangladesh</h5>
		<h5>Friday 17 June 2005 University of London.<span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></h5>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Lord 
		Avebury, Vice Chair of the UK Parliamentary Human Rights Group, and 
		Chairman of the Steering Committee of the ‘European Human Rights 
		Conference on&nbsp; Bangladesh’ held in SOAS, University of London on 
		17th June 2005, has issued the following statement in response to 
		allegations of the Bangladesh High Commissioner in London.<br>
		<br>
		I am disappointed by the false statement issued by the
		<span style="color:black;
layout-grid-mode:line">H E Mr A H Mofazzal Karim, </span>Bangladesh High 
		Commissioner in London about the holding and conduct of the one day 
		conference on Bangladesh. The UK Parliamentary Human Rights Group was 
		one of the sponsors of this Conference and its aim was to provide an 
		opportunity for a factual analysis of the very serious problems 
		affecting secular political parties/groups as well as ethnic &amp; religious 
		minorities in context of the growing extremism and the worrying culture 
		of impunity in Bangladesh.<br>
		<br>
		These are areas of legitimate and continuing interest for the UK 
		Parliament as well as the international community and it was hoped that 
		the Bangladesh Government would use the occasion of the Conference to 
		provide its inputs and engage in a constructive and mature manner.<br>
		<br>
		We were very fair to the Government of Bangladesh in allotting them two 
		slots in the Conference whereas all other Groups including even the main 
		opposition party, the Awami League were given only one slot filled by 
		its representative, Saber Chowdhury.<br>
		<br>
		The meeting did not &quot;break up in disarray&quot; but continued till 18:00 as 
		scheduled and was participated by all including Advocate Sigma Huda.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">All 
		participants agreed the Conference was an outstanding success in 
		bringing together representatives of all the beleaguered and persecuted 
		groups, and in agreeing to further the initiative of the Conference by 
		forming an international network.<br>
		<br>
		The High Commissioner was interrupted during his presentation by other 
		participants when he tried to assert there was no violation of human 
		rights in Bangladesh and later on, in response to questions when he 
		stated that &quot;many&quot; BNP MPs were assassinated during the 1996-2001 Awami 
		League term of office. The participants also objected when he appeared 
		to assert that the rights of the Ahmadiyyas were less important, because 
		they were less numerous.<br>
		<br>
		But the Chair of Plenary session, Professor Werner Menski had no 
		difficulty in maintaining order and in fact allowed the High 
		Commissioner additional time to compensate for the interruptions.<br>
		<br>
		There was a disturbance in the afternoon Plenary&nbsp;Session when the second 
		of the two Government speakers, Advocate Khondker Mahbubuddin Ahmed MP 
		refused to accept the ruling of the Chair, Lord Dholakia that his time 
		was up. All the Speakers were strictly limited to ten minutes but the 
		Chair had allowed Mr. Ahmed an additional five minutes.<br>
		<br>
		The High Commissioner had been alerted in writing on three occasions 
		that a list of five persons named by him were invited to attend the 
		Conference but he brought along an additional five, and together they 
		shouted and protested the ruling of the Chair as Mr. Ahmed sought to 
		continue his speech. Some people in the audience shouted back. The High 
		Commissioner and his party then withdrew.<br>
		<br>
		Professor Mable Gomes was one of the five people invited at the request 
		of <br>
		the High Commissioner and although she had asked questions in the 
		morning Plenary and participated actively till then, she also left with 
		him, forfeiting opportunity to participate in the afternoon workshops.<br>
		<br>
		It is clear to me, from the High Commissioner's determination to bring 
		in extra people who were not invited, and from the conduct of his group 
		when they refused to accept the Chair's ruling, that their object was 
		not to contribute to the discussion of the unacceptable human rights 
		situation in Bangladesh but to sabotage the initiative if possible, and 
		if not, to creating disorder by wilfully choosing not to comply with 
		universally accepted rules of debate.<br>
