		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pakistan has or had never been a 
		country of my liking, though I was brought up in that theocratic country 
		which called itself ‘Islamic Republic of Pakistan’ since 1956 when it 
		adopted its first constitution. The country was created through hatred, 
		malice and on the basis of the so-called two nation theory, the basis of 
		which as Mr. M A Jinnah, fondly called as Quide Azam by his followers, 
		understood that religion could be the only element of nationhood and no 
		other elements such as culture, language, history and of course 
		geography had any role in nation making. And according this theory 
		Hindus and Moslems constitute separate nations. Jinnah always depicted 
		Congress as the party of Hindus looking after the interest of only 
		Hindus, even not other non-Muslim communities. On the other hand Jinnah 
		claimed the monopoly of Muslims’ interest that was being looked after by 
		the Muslim League, and only Muslim League. To him Muslim League and 
		Muslims are synonymous. Even the secular British Rulers fell in the trap 
		of Muslim League, which was created by the British Raj on the philosophy 
		of ‘Divide an Rule’ to check Hindu dominated Bengali nationalism whose 
		main object was to evict Britishers from the soil of India. If logic is 
		to be followed then why India should be of only two nations Muslims and 
		Hindus; then India should have been divided into at least three or four 
		states instead of only two. But to Jinnah and Muslim League logic had no 
		place. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even in Jinnah’s own time he saw 
		the futility of two nation theory when most of the Muslims in India 
		refused to migrate to India to accept the nationality of newly born 
		Pakistan even after the threat given by Sardar Ballavbhai Patel that the 
		Muslims in India who fought for Pakistan had no right to stay in India. 
		Fortunately for the Muslims in India religious but humanist Mahatma 
		Gandhi and secularist Jawaharlal Nehru gave no support to the theory of 
		Patel and stood behind the Indian Muslims who declared allegiance to 
		democratic and secular India. Secularism became the basic philosophy, 
		though not written, of Indian polity under the leadership of great 
		Nehru, a strong believer of socialism ably supported by Maolana Azad, 
		Rafi Ahmed Kidowai, Jayprakash Narayan, Sarojini Naidu and other 
		congress leaders. The proposal of some Muslim Leaguers that Muslim-Hindu 
		population be exchanged between the two countries to make Pakistan a 
		completely monolithic state was out right rejected by Jinnah on the very 
		pragmatic ground. Farsighted Jinnah could see that wholesale migration 
		Moslems from India would create tremendous pressure on the economy of 
		young Pakistan threatening its very existence. Quide Azam many a times 
		advised left out millions of Muslims in India to become good citizens of 
		free India instead of migrating to Pakistan. He even went to the extent 
		of vowing to make Pakistan a modern state run by the states craft based 
		western style liberal democracy and modern economy. Although he did not 
		mention the word secularism, but he made himself clear what the state of 
		Pakistan likely to be in which all citizens would enjoy equal rights and 
		protection of law. Just after creation of Pakistan a few months back MA 
		Jinnah, father of Pakistan, made a historic speech in the first meeting 
		of the constituent assembly about the future of Pakistan and the place 
		of religion in the state affairs. He said. “ .. .. You are free to go o 
		your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or any other places of 
		worship in this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or 
		caste or creed- that has nothing to do with the fundamental principles 
		that we are all citizen and equal citizen of our sate. In course of time 
		Hindus will case to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not 
		in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each 
		individual, but in political sense as citizens of the state. ..”. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But after the death of Jinnah, 
		his disciple first PM of Pakistan declared that Pakistan would be a 
		Moslem State that would be run by the Islamic principles and laws. With 
		it died the liberalism, modernity and budding secular democracy in 
		Pakistan permanently. Very shortly it became a theocratic state ‘Islamic 
		Republic’ or Islamic Zamhuriyat. Even Ayub Khan, a Sand rust trained 
		army general with modern outlook could not reverse the path of history. 
		Mullaism, Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism with army backing grabbed 
		the Pakistani state power from which Pakistan had never been able to 
		come out with peoples’ true wishes. Throughout its history two thirds of 
		its life Pakistan was ruled by the army generals which supported 
		terrorism and mullahism for its sustenance and perpetuation killing 
		peoples democracy. Even the short periods of intervening so called civil 
		rules were supervised and monitored by the army sitting on the neck of 
		the civil government. It is no wonder that Liaquat Khan was assassinated 
		and in sequence of the terrorist history of Pakistan Benazir Bhutta, 
		daughter of bumptious and talkative Julfiquar Ali Bhutto, is the last 
		victim at the altar of terrorism, mullahism and militarilism </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To me Pakistan is a dead case 
		and with the funeral of Benazir Bhutto, a colourful lady in Pakistani 
		politics we may pray janaza for Pakistan too. </font></p>
