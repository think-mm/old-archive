  Bengal, is made of coastal plain land not much above 5 ft from sea level. On

  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">The district administration extends main 
  Bhola and a few islands (chars) including Rajapur, Gangapur, Charpatila, Dhal 
  Char, Char Nijam, and Monpura. The district consists of six upazilas or thanas 
  (police station) : Bhola Sadar, Daulatkhan, Bohranuddin, Tazumuddin, Lalmohan, 
  Charfashion, and Manpura. Bhola has four constituencies in the Parliament: 
  Bhola 1 consisting Bhola Sadar upazila, Bhola 2 consisting of Daulatpur and 
  Bohranuddin upazilas, Bhola 3 consisting of Tazumuddin &amp; Lalmohan upazilas, 
  and Bhola 4 consisting of Charfashion &amp; Manpura upazilas. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">Our trip mainly confined to three 
  villages under Lord Hardinge union of Lalmohan upazila (police station) in the 
  district concerned with the collection of some facts of affected families 
  belonging to minority communities in post election violence against minorities 
  in the night of 2nd October and the following day. We concentrated our survey 
  on Annada Prasad village, as it was the most affected area. The village has 
  about 22 hundred Hindu voters, assuming each family has 4 voters number of 
  families would be more than 500. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">On the day before election i.e. on 30th 
  September, the villagers who were preparing mentally to go to the nearest 
  polling booth (a primary school selected for booth) for voting to a candidate 
  of their choice, could not imagine what a horrible experience were awaiting 
  for them on the following two days. On 30th September the minority voters were 
  cautioned and threatened of serious consequences if they go to the booth and 
  cast vote in favour of symbol 'Boat'. Most of the Hindu voters took the 
  warning seriously, but some did go to vote. On the Election Day, these willing 
  Hindu voters were intercepted on the way and refused entering the booth by a 
  group of terrorists. The trouble started there. Sensing trouble these people 
  turned back. But they did not know at that time what were coming next. The 
  story is harrowing as is gradually revealed to us by those who went through 
  these horror continued for two days. They recalled that even in the worst days 
  of 1971 when Pakistani soldiers were committing sin against Bengali population 
  number of enmasse raping was very limited compared to what happened in Annada 
  Prasad.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify"><br>
  But first thing first. A team, under the banner of &quot;Nagarik Adhikar Sanrakshan 
  o Sampradayikata Pratirodh Kamati (Committee for Protection of Civil Rights 
  and Elimination of Communalism), consisting of a university teacher, a veteran 
  political leader and a social worker, a noted journalist and columnist of very 
  popular Bengali daily, a photo journalist, three legal experts, and five human 
  right workers (all belongs to a small organization &quot;Humanist Rationalist 
  International&quot;) left Dhaka on Thursday, 27th December for Bhola for a two day 
  programme of visiting the worst affected areas of Bhola district in a recent 
  two-month long violence against religious minorities. The team arrived Bhola 
  on the following day (28th December) at 7 a.m. and joined by two local 
  journalists of whom one is a special correspondent of Sangbad and other of 
  Janakantha and a local advocate. They immediately at about 9 a.m. proceeded 
  for Lalmohan the thana head quarter of the upazila Lalmohan with ultimate 
  destination to reach Annada Prasad, a remote village under Lord Hardinge 
  union. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">Lalmohan Thana is about 45 km from Bhola 
  town directly south lying on a Bhola-Charfashion metalled road stretching 
  north-south. About a kilometer further south lies a small bazar Kartar Bazar 
  from where a small side road branching off from the main road towards east 
  leads to Lord Hardinge, the union head quarter about 2-3 km from Lalmohan. 
  Midway between Lord Hardinge and GM Bazar (also known as Annada Prasad Bazar) 
  lies another small bazar named Rai-Chand. From this bazar a village 'local 
  board' road (but motorable) slightly south-east, leads to GM Bazar (Goona Moni 
  Bazar),- a small bazar with few shops of thatched roof, a small tea stall as 
  well. At this Bazar a police sub-station has been set by the district SP 
  authority following the large scale violence at and around Lord Hardinge union 
  with very much disliking of the local BNP leaders and their armed followers. 
  Only seven sepoys are deployed there for patrolling and keeping peace in the 
  area. General complain is however that police prefer most of the time 
  gossiping and drinking teas with the known cadres against whom they were 
  deployed to work. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">It is a chilly December morning of 28th 
  December at 11 a.m. with lot of sunshine we reached Annada Prasad village, 
  which is now internationally known locality where inhuman and barbaric acts of 
  violence have been committed against hundreds of innocent families of Hindu 
  minorities. The violence that took place following the general election on 1st 
  October continued for more than 36 hours have all character- ransacking and 
  destruction of residence small or big, hut or tin-shed made little difference 
  to the perpetrators, looting of all kind of properties, utensils, food-grains, 
  clothing, cash money &amp; gold ornaments wherever available, physical torture, 
  molestation of chastity, and gang raping. But what is the offence of these 
  simple god-fearing people? Why should they be exposed to such humiliating and 
  atrocious inhuman treatment by the armed cadres of victorious BNP-led 4 party 
  alliance. This the question we asked to both the victims and the alleged 
  perpetrators committing violence against them. The victims' typical answer(s) 
  was &quot;we don't know Babu; may be they doubted that we cast votes in favour of 
  Boat. But honestly speaking Babu, we didn't go even near the poling booth.&quot; 
  The alleged perpetrators' typical answer(s) was, &quot; no sir, nothing serious 
  happened here. For some unknown reason, they got panicky and fled away from 
  their homes. As a result some miscreants might have, taking advantage of the 
  situation looted some properties from the vacant quarters, but nothing 
  serious. Only one or two cases might be.&quot; </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">When we entered the house of Gajendra 
  his wife Tinkubala, being introduced by a local journalist to the visiting 
  team, were overwhelmed with surprise and joy. They welcomed us with tears in 
  their eyes. The couple, parents of the wretched girl, a victim of gang rape 
  committed by at least 4-5 persons, with tears and fear in their eyes narrated 
  the whole story of the dreadful night of 2nd October. The little pretty girl 
  aged between 8-9 years named Momota, is now hiding in an undisclosed address 
  for her personal safety. Gauranga, a simple looking thin statured mid aged 
  man, is a day labourer having no land or house of his own. The couple has two 
  daughters Momota being eldest. The family lives in a cottage constructed on a 
  piece of land within the house complex of Subal Chandra, locally known as 'Subal 
  Dokandarer Bari' (house complex of Subal grocer).

  <br>
  <b><i>Photo: Momota (8-9), a student of class IV, lost her Nakful ( Nose-pin, 
  the symbol oh her honour) On the dreadful night of October 2. Is there a 
  future for this poor girl, daughter of Kamla-Couple having lost all their 
  properties.</i></b> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">Momota, a student of class III or IV 
  used to go to a nearby primary school (GM School) before the dreadful event 
  that completely shattered her life pattern. She didn't know what is called 'Bhot', 
  BNP or AL, nor she has any concept of democracy, election, nor does she 
  understand the meaning of those terrible symbols 'Dhaner Shis' (ear of paddy), 
  Dari Palla (balance), and 'Nauka' (boat). She took shelter in a near by &quot;house 
  complex&quot; locally called Vendar Bari (also called Dwip Bari or Mistry Bari) 
  with her parents. The Vendar Bari was thought to be a relatively safe place as 
  the complex is surrounded with knee deep water of the agricultural fields, 
  even in month of October. The head of the complex, an elderly and respected 
  gentleman of 75-year-old named Nagendra Chandra Das, whose fore father was 
  once a Vendor (dealer of land documents used for registration during 
  sale-purchase deeds) gave shelter not less than hundred women of different 
  ages. When the terrorists numbering around hundred armed with different kinds 
  of lethal weapons including fire arms and bombs attacked the complex dividing 
  themselves into different groups of about ten or so Momota was hiding herself 
  behind the side of a concrete well embracing a small doll in her chest. At 
  about 11 p.m. she was discovered by a gang of 5-6 young men who dragged her to 
  near by field. They raped her for more than half an hour and returned her to 
  Vendar Bari complex. During this sexual assault she cried for help but no body 
  dare to come to her rescue, nor she could draw any mercy of the sex-maniacs. 
  She however could identify, later disclosed to the police, these goondas. The 
  panic stricken family on return to their cottage on the following day found 
  that their cottage destroyed, whatever they had a sum of Tk 700/-, Rice two 
  monds, a radio set and clothing. The family is completely ruined having no 
  penny. They are now living on collecting left out corns on the paddy field 
  after the harvest. It is further learnt that while describing the event Momota 
  disclosed that on the dreadful night the goondas even did not spare her mother 
  from sexual violence, although her mother when asked now keep mum neither 
  denying nor admitting verbally. But expression of her face even after so many 
  days is a clear indication that she even was not spared by the goondas. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">As she became ill her parents took her 
  to Lalmohan Thana Health Complex, where she was given medical checkup and 
  treatment. With the help of the doctors the Lalmohan police took the case of 
  Momota. She was in the hospital for 12 days. According to FIR and the Lalmohan 
  Ps source, two accused were arrested namely Selim, a local well known mastan 
  and his accomplice Dulal another local mastan. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">The team then moved to Abani Daser (or 
  Labani Daser ? ) about a farlong from the house of Subal grocer, where hearing 
  our arrival gathered quite a few villagers to tell their story. Every one is 
  eager to tell the horror of their experience. One such person is Sujan Das, a 
  day laborer narrated that he had been robbed of every thing including his 
  shirts and lungis. Liton Chandra Das, Sudeb Chandra Das , Pinaki Das and like 
  them 30-40 persons took shelter at Ganga Charan Daser Bari (House of 
  Gangacharan). All of them robbed of their properties, and houses ransacked. 
  Families of Sudarsan manegere'r bari (House of Sudrasan Maneger) took shelter 
  in Annda Prasad from the adjacent Fatemabad village just after election for 
  fear. Sushil Chandra Das son of late Ananta Das, a member of one such families 
  informed us that in their complex, houses of all families were looted- 
  including food grains, Dals, dried chilies, poltries, and ransacked the 
  structures of their houses. When our learned professor of the team asked him 
  why they are not returning to own village, Sunil who has four family members 
  including two sons said in a very low voice that there are no Hindus now in 
  that village. &quot;if our family goes back, they will extort money from us''. When 
  asked who are those 'they', Sunil kept mum. &quot;Bangldesh is not for you.&quot;- 
  threatened them two local mastans. One of them is a son of Yasin Master, a 
  very influential man of the locality, and another is &quot;Bellal&quot;, both were 
  arrested on charge of looting and raping. But he then hurriedly added that one 
  of them 'Bellal' has been released on bail. The hooligans of the area, he 
  alleged, get support from local BNP leaders like Yasin Master and Abul Kasem.
  </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">Jesmin, and her husband live here within 
  the complex. When we arrived at the complex we were informed that Jesmin was 
  taking her bath in nearby pond. As she completed her bath we kept on listening 
  to peoples gathered around us, numbering not less than thirty. All are eager 
  to tell their version of that dreadful night of October 2. Story is similar, 
  pathetically identical; pattern of repression and torture, in many cases 
  repeated several times. Swapan Das, son of late Atul Das used to live in his 
  village home with peace and tranquility. He never dreamt that after Babri 
  Mosque reaction in 1992, similar thing in larger scale could befall on them. 
  Swapan, head of his family of 4 members including two daughters and his wife 
  is a poor cultivator having some lands of his own. On the dreadful night 
  everything he had were robbed off. The House complex is known as 'Nishikanter 
  House'; Nishikanta was his grandfather. Now he is penniless. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">Our female member of the team privately 
  talked to Jesmin in a small room used as Thakur Ghar. Story of Jesmin is no 
  exception- being robbed of her nakful (nose ring) symbolizing the loss of her 
  greatest wealth, the chastity on that dreadful night of October 2. Jesmin (35) 
  daughter of Matilal-Sadarani couple and wife of Subas Chandra Das with other 
  family members fled away from their home to a nearby house known as 'Gangacharaner 
  Bari' for shelter in the evening of election day i.e. October 1, out of Fear.

  <br>
  <b><i>Photo: Jesmin (35) wife of a day labourer (Kamla), mother of a beautiful 
  good looking girl of age 14 lost her Nakful to save her daughter. This 
  courageous one legged lady lost all faith in our State , we call proudly 
  'Mother Bangla' which can not protect her. Where she would ask for justice ?</i></b>
  </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">The reason of fear is that the 
  miscreants, allegedly supporters of 4-party alliance demanded a handsome 
  amount of taka as subscription a few days before general election. According 
  to her FIR report, on the early morning around 2 a.m. of October 2, about 
  18-20 persons attacked the Gangacharan house complex. The inmates of the house 
  including who took shelter there started fleeing in all directions. She fled 
  away to a nearby paddy field submerged with water. But the goondas dragged her 
  and asked 'where is your daughter?' As she answered negative about the 
  whereabouts of her young daughter, the goondas beat her, hacked her with a 
  chopper here and there, and finally snatched away her nakful (symbolizing the 
  loss of her chastity). She could recognize at least 3 persons. After then the 
  goondas dragged her to house and once again two persons looted her honour in 
  nearby turmeric field (Haldi khet). 'I was left at the turmeric garden whole 
  night', being unable to move alone, she narrated with tears in her eyes. She 
  was then taken to a nearest health complex at Lalmohan where she spent 9 days 
  receiving medical treatment. Out of fear, she however sent her daughter to a 
  safer place out of Bhola. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">Not only she lost her personal wealth; 
  her properties left at her house were looted. Her husband has filed a case of 
  looting, rioting etc in Lalmohan Ps against at least 10 persons. Jesmin 
  herself filed another case of violation of chastity in the same Police 
  station. We had no language to solace this courageous disabled lady having 
  lost one leg long time back. But to save her daughter from the hands of the 
  goondas she sent her daughter to an undisclosed address. </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">The team then moved to Gangaramer Bari 
  where Jesmin's family with her grown up daughter took shelter. The house 
  complex shows the sign of nobility and old tradition. The complex is now know 
  as Brojarajkumarer Bari. Brojorajkumar is now the eldest descendent of his 
  fore father Gangaram Charan Das. The family once used to be known as Talukdar 
  family. In this complex now lives 3 families all are related to each other. 
  Brojorajkumar Babu, an elderly man of 108 years age is well-respected person 
  of the locality. Once the family was very large; now his family members 
  reduced to 12. In the last communal disturbance of 1992, 22 members of his own 
  family left for West Bengal permanently. The old gentleman disclosed to our 
  professor that their family had great tradition and well respected once, but 
  now the new youngsters and new settlers ignore him and even insult him having 
  no respect for the local people. Unfortunately these new settlers now control 
  the social and political activities of the locality in which they have no say. 
  As our Professor talked to him he showed his wide knowledge in history, 
  tradition and culture not only of his locality but also of whole of Bengal and 
  the Indian Subcontinent. He proudly stated that he saw the Victorian age of 
  British Raj and its nobility. Brojorajkumar babu said his family belongs to 
  Das caste and of Kashyap gotra of Sanatan Dharma (now known as Hinduism). When 
  the miscreants of the locality offered him &amp; his family's safety many a time 
  in lieu of their conversion to Islam, Brojorajkumar rejected the idea 
  forthwith. Another senior member, a well known political and social leader, of 
  our team when asked the grand old man why BNP cadres turned on them even when 
  their candidate won the seat. The gentleman looked up pointing his forefinger 
  to the open sky meaning, &quot;HE knows&quot;. When some one told him that to &quot;HIM&quot; all 
  are equal, why should then you poor people would be tortured inhumanly?

  <b><i>Photo: Brojorajkumar Babu, a most respected grand old man of age 108 of 
  the village, not only insulted by a group of gangsters numbering 20 of age of 
  his grand-grand sons but severely beaten with heavy iron rod on his hands, 
  legs, chest and back. He completely broke down as he narrated his harrowing 
  experience to one of our team mate.</i></b> </p>
  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">He kept silent giving a faint smile. As 
  our video team stated recording his description of unimaginable torture on his 
  person and the people who took shelter in his complex including the womenfolk, 
  he burst into tears. And for the first time he succumbed to emotion, and on 
  all a sudden he fell down from his siting small stool. The perpetrators not 
  only robbed all their belongings and properties, they mercilessly beat him 
  with iron rod on legs, hands, chest and on the back. The beating sign on his 
  back still exists as he showed it to us. The location is still swelling and 
  sensitive. He needs immediate medical treatment. But who will come forward not 
  only with money but good will and courage. I personally have no faith on &quot;uparwalla&quot; 
  (the God Almighty), but even then if I see that 'HIM', I would just tell him 
  that there is no reason for your great presence in the Universe. We talked to 
  many persons assembled there to tell their experience of horror. But with 
  little time left as the winter sun setting down western horizon, we left 
  Brojorajkumar babu on his fate and moved to another locality called Howladarer 
  Bari, another place of horror.

  <p class="Black9Text" align="justify">When we arrived at Utfulla Howlader's 
  house the sun is few degrees above the horizon. Atmosphere calm, the western 
  sky is getting red. The head of the family Mr. Howlader, who already got the 
  message of our arrival at Annada Prasad, warmly received from the earthen path 
  leading to his home. We all sat on a wooden bench scattered around the yard. 
  In side Howladar complex lives three family. Utfulla Babu's family, it 
  appears, is a well to do. The members of the family fled away from the complex 
  on 2nd October. The hooligans as usual looted every thing including TV sets, 
  gold ornaments, cash money wherever available, rice, dried chilies, betel-nuts 
  and other agricultural products. However, none of the girls were physically or 
  otherwise tortured, many male members and youths were beaten alleging that 
  they have cast votes in favour of boat. Monoranjan Das (55), head of another 
  family in the complex, nephew of Utfulla Babu, narrated the same story. He on 
  behalf of the entire complex members filed a case of looting and rioting with 
  Lalmohan Ps. According to Chitta babu, from the morning 11 a.m. of 2nd October 
  problem started. The waves of assault by the hooligans armed with lethal 
  weapons carried in a 4 and 5 groups at least 4-5 times. At about 11 a.m., 
  according to Chittaranjan, an armed group from across a nearby canal from the 
  west entered the complex and started beating one inmates (Ratan) of the 
  complex. Another man Suruj was beaten at the side of the canal. The terrorists 
  numbered about 20-30 of ages between 14-20. &quot;We fled away as they entered the 
  complex, and saw from distance that miscreants looting our properties.&quot; In 
  another assault about 30-40 miscreants took part and looted the properties at 
  about 8 p.m. At least 9 accused were identified of which one was arrested. The 
  family-head entertained us with refreshing drink 'green coconut' water. We 
  were so tired that the drink acted as tonic and created a new zeal among the 
  volunteers. </p>
