  &nbsp;Sectarian violence against Shias in Pakistan continues. After violent
  suicidal bomb attacks in a Shiaite Mosque in several months ago, once again
  according to police source suspected suicidal bomb exploded in Shia Mosque on
  Friday (1<sup>st</sup> October) during Jumma prayer while hundreds of Musullis
  (devotees) were offering the namaj. This time the place of occurrence is
  Shialkot, an eastern Pakistani city. The incident bears a very close
  similarity with the Karachi incident. At least 25 persons were killed on the
  spot and seriously wounded numbering not less than a hundred. The police said
  that bomb(s) was transplanted within a briefcase placed at the central place
  of the big prayer hall of the mosque known as Abdullah Imambarah mosque. The
  blast created chaos confusion and panic among the devotees. Wounded as well
  dead bodies were found scattered with torn pieces of fleshes. The central
  place of the hall became a pool of blood. The dead and wounded were rushed to
  the nearby hospitals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">According an eyewitness Hamid Naqvi attending the
  prayer who was admitted at the Allamah Iqbal hospital said, according to AFP
  agency, “ We were hearing the Khutba when suddenly there was a big bang.
  There was panic and there was blood and screams all around.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">Police said that there was yet another un-blasted bomb
  near the central place which was safely carried away by them. As usual angry
  and violent protests followed from the Shias which spread also to Karachi and
  other cities in Pakistan. The information minister reacted saying that this
  could be a possible reaction to the killing of a leading Al Qaeda named Amjad
  Faruqui at the hands of Pakistani Security forces. The minister opined, “It
  is an act of terrorism aimed at destabilizing the country.” – a typical
  statement of a politician. Even a child can say that it is an act terrorism
  and violence, not an act of peace &amp; love. The president Musharraff also
  issued a routine statement condemning the event. I said the incident bears a
  close similarity with that of bomb blast at a Karachi Shia mosque. On that
  occasion President Pervez uttered that the act of violence inside the mosque
  was a ‘<span style="color:red">heinous act of terrorism</span>’ followed
  by an order of inquiry (as usual). This time President Pervez Musharraf said
  the attack “clearly shows that terrorists have no religion and are enemies
  of the mankind.”</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">A great discovery indeed on the part of the President,
  but alas a late realization! Where you had been Mr. President when you and
  your Pakistani military and your ASI were training the talebenas militarily
  and your mullahs were brainwashing the so-called soldiers of Islam in the form
  of Talebans with the doctrines of Islamic fundamentalism, communalism and
  worst kind of terrorism in the name of jihad. You knew very well Mr. President
  that fundamentalist political parties of Pakistan, including Jamat e Islami
  and jihadis are out to make Pakistan a Sunni brand of theocratic state. They
  are not satisfied with Moslem league or PPP brand of Islamic republic. They
  want to make Pakistan a purely monolithic Sunni brand of Talebani State. They
  have finished or subdued religious minorities like Hindus Christians and then
  Ahmediyas. They are now determined to wipe out next religious minority sect
  within Islam, the Shias. The fundamentalists have eliminated secularists among
  the Muslims from the political and cultural life of Pakistan. Unless Pakistan
  nourishes secular forces and democratic institutions, the Islamic
  Fundamentalism will crush Pakistan; its future is very dark. First step on the
  part of the President would, a very difficult task indeed, to free Pakistan
  from military control, because Pakistani military is the root of all
  fundamentalism. This very institution is synonymous with fundamentalism,
  Islamic dogma and blind communalism. If Military could be democratized and
  secularized 90 % of Pakistan would be over. The Pakistani fundamentalists
  heavily depend on their support, and indeed they get it through their various
  local and non-local agencies, be in Afghanistan, or in India held Kashmir or
  in Bangladesh.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">Remember Pakistan has wiped out its Hindu population
  long before, Christians have been subdued, Ahmedias declared non muslim and
  has been wiped out from social, cultural and political life of Pakistan. The
  only threat that exists in Pakistan to make Pakistan a Talebani form of
  Islamic State by the fundamentalists is the Shiah community which constitute
  about 20% of the population in Pakistan. Compare this figure with the
  non-Muslim population in BD where it constitutes 10-15%. So BD’s Islamic
  forces main target is the non-Muslim minority. Thus fight is similar both in
  BD and Pakistan, only targets are different. Jihadis in both countries are
  following similar paths; only in BD minorities are exposed to sterner
  treatment.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">The fight in BD is between secularists-liberal
  democrats-socialists Vs Islamic fundamentalists of all variants and BNP brand
  communalists. Are we aware of the situation !<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
