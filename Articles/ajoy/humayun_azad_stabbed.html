  <p class="MsoNormal">Dear Muktomonas,</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">You must have learnt about the terrible incident. All
  points leads to Jamat and fundamentalists' hand in it. Here is the full story.
  &nbsp;<O>

  <h6 align="center"><font color="#ff0000" size="5">Dr. Humayun Azad, My
  Colleague, Stabbed fatally</font></h6>

  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoHeading7"><u>Date line 28. 02. 04</u></p>
  <p class="MsoHeading7">Let me begin the story by asking our very competent
  Khaleda _Nizami government, please tell us, &quot;who is your next target
  ?&quot;. After killing Manik Babu, noted journalist of Bnagladesh, your men
  assaulted Dr. Kamal Hosain and Mr. Pankaj Bhattacharya, a veteran politician
  only a few days back, and then you targeted Dr. Humayun Azad. One point bears
  similarity-- all of them do not believe in your political philosophy, rather
  they all are liberal, secular, democratic and anti fundamentalism. All are
  intellectually sound. Are you after the intellectuals now ? Tell us freely and
  honestly.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Azad a close colleague of mine in the university
  circle is now fighting for his life in the Combined Military Hospital (CMH)
  after being stabbed grievously by some unknown group of armed terrorists
  tomorrow night at about 9-30 p.m. just before the Bangla Academy on the other
  side of the road. Yes, another victim of Khaleda government’s nourished band
  of fundamentalist gangsters. Dr. Azad is a forceful writer of contemporary
  Bangladesh with his pen freely moving from lyrical poems to serious material
  based novels. He has already earned a fame as a non-conventional and
  controversial writer for which he is very proud off.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span>What happened really ?<O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday was the last day of boi-mela (book fare) in the
  Bangla Academy premises. I gathered that at around 5-30 p.m. he left his
  residence at Fuller Road area, very near to the D.U. Campus, and stayed there
  for more than 3 years. As has been reported by all daily newspapers and the
  BBC report, he left the Academy at about 9 p.m. And before he left he also
  talked to channel I reporter that has been telecast in its evening new
  bulletin. I saw Humayun with his characteristic smiling face a very jubilant
  person, speaking to reporters, “I am feeling fine, as the people are seen
  loitering, talking to each other, exchanging greetings, and even few are still
  buying books.” Azad also spent some time in a bookstall.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">After leaving the academy premise he crossed the main
  road to other side and walking slowly along the road with apparently talking
  to some one, as he was moving on. When he arrived opposite to the Atomic
  Energy Commission Building, two or three young men approached him. He was
  found talking to them, say about 5 minutes, when two of them all on a sudden
  chopped him from behind – one at the back of his neck (left side), one near
  the head, two wounds were made on his left faces. He cried out for help, and
  fell down on the street profusely bleeding. There was small book selling space
  on the pavement and a food selling shop. The boy selling the books rushed to
  him and others also rushed to the wounded professor. As the rescuers
  approaching, the terrorists, numbering probably 4 exploded one or two hand
  made bombs and made their escape through the Surwardy Uddan in the dark. By
  the time police arrived and took him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. This
  was about 10 p.m. He went through an emergency operation arresting the
  bleeding. But as his condition was worsening because of bleeding, he was
  transferred to CMH at about 11 p.m. There he underwent another operation. The
  doctors said his condition is quite critical, as he has lost considerable
  amount of blood, which has to be supplemented immediately.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font color="#800000"><u><span><b>Eye witness to the
  incident<O>
  </b>
  </O>
  </span></u></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3">A woman of middle age and a small daughter and son of
  her saw the detail of the occurrence. The channel I interviewed them. Both the
  girl and the boy gave a vivid description, “ we saw a few young men
  approaching sir, and one was already walking with him talking to sir. The
  approaching young men all on a sudden fell on him with choppers. They started
  chopping sir, here and there, especially around his neck. We found sir felling
  down with cry. Instantly the pavement was full of blood. His shirt was full of
  blood.” The police later on discovered a chapatti from the Surwardy Uddan
  ground.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The immediate reason for such violent attack is still
  unknown, as usual the note says. But his family source said that he has always
  been a target of the fundamentalists and the communalists because of his
  anti-fundamentalist stand and government posture. Neither the Madame Zia nor
  Mr. Nizami, two stalwart of fundamentalism in Bangladesh was happy about the
  writings of Dr. Azad. The previous Khaleda government proscribed his book
  entitled “<i>Nari</i>”.</p>
  <h4><font color="#800000">Protests Continuing</font></h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal">All political parties including AL, 11-party alliances,
  cultural and human rights organizations have condemned the event. All leading
  political personalities including Sheikh Hasina, Dr Kamal Hosain decried the
  event as an ample proof of failure of Khaleda_Nizami alliance government in
  dealing with the terrorists.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText3">Spontaneous processions of DU students and some
  teachers were brought out at the campus, whereas the action of the government
  was to deploy huge number combat police force in and around the campus. T</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Today (28. 02. 04) the campus was full of protests
  meetings and protest processions. They demanded immediate arrest of the
  culprits and restoration of law and order in the country. Professor Arefin
  Siddiqui, president of Dhaka University Teachers’ Association condemned the
  event demanding the culprits to bring to justice. Professor Arefin depicted
  him as the symbol secularism, a symbol of anti-communalism and
  anti-fundamentalism, and that is why that symbol was chosen to warn all of us
  who also have faiths in those basic doctrines. Dr. A. K. Azad Chodhury,
  erstwhile VC, DU also expressed his concern on the attack on a writer
  professor and a secular minded thinker. Professor Sirajul Islam Choudhury
  commented that such crime from the fundamentalist is not entirely unexpected,
  as the government is patronizing them. A student said, “This government
  should resign immediately, as it failed to protect a respected teacher of the
  university.” The sammilito Sanskrit jote and Udichi organized a protest
  assembly at the shahid minar in the afternoon.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" color="#800000">Sheikh Hasina intercepted</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Our senabahini claims that they are soldiers for the
  people and of the people, but they care little for people’s representatives
  MPs, non-government party leaders, or even the leader of the opposition,
  Sheikh Hasina. Our senabahini knows only to salute the persons in power. The
  following story illustrates the point.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Today she was driving toward CMH to see the ailing Dr.
  Humayun Azad. Her car was intercepted and was not allowed to pass. She then
  walked down about 3 km path towards CMH, and again she was intercepted and she
  had to come back without seeing Dr. Azad as she was not allowed to go to CMH.
  What kind of rules and regulations our army has framed that even a minimum
  courtesy was not shown to even person like Sheikh Hasina, the leader of the
  opposition. Now let me ask if PM has been in the car, what treatment she would
  have received, would she have been turned back from the CMH not being allowed
  to see Dr. Azad.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <h4><font color="#800000">Latest Position</font></h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal">The CMH source said today that he has been transferred to
  ICU following critical operation and his condition would remain critical for
  not less than 72 hours. He has been taken to Popular diagnostic center,
  Dhanmondi for CAT scan. Doctors conducting the scanning see the sign of blood
  clotting, which is a sign of attack on the brain. How serious is it doctors
  are not sure. But they expressed some concern.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font color="#800000"><b>Where is our interior
  minister</b></font><b> ? </b><O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">It is good to see that our talkative interior minister
  still has not opened his mouth. Perhaps he is busy manufacturing a story with
  intensive consultation with his mentor the PM. His deputy however went to the
  CMH along with City mayor. Both of whom faced volley of questions from the
  daughter of Dr. Azad, and obviously those were not very palatable.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Humayun Azad, as I mentioned is a poet, novelist,
  essayist of no mean caliber. But I admire him for his scholarships. He is
  probably the best linguist and philologist in our country today. I have been
  immensely benefited from reading his excellent works like<i> Pronominalization
  in Bengali, Tulanamulak and Oitihasik Bhasabijnan (The comparative and
  historical Science of Language, Bakyatatwa. </i>In here true talents of
  Humayun are fully exposed. He was known for his controversial approach and one
  is not happy to converse with his unless the talker has the minimum level.
  Humayun make no secret despising a person having poor background of knowledge.
  I am not always in tune with his wavelength on many issues, but surely I had
  seldom difference in opinion in fighting against fundamentalism and
  obscurantism. He is not only a good teacher, but also a man of open and
  liberal mind with freethinking. A liberal mind cannot be a communal, and here
  he has invited enmity from the Jamatis, BNPs and other fundamentalists because
  of his writings against fundamentalism and against oppression against
  women.His Nari and Dwtiya Linga created some comotion in the conservative
  circles.</p>
  <h4>Police Action<span><O>
  </O>
  </span></h4>
  <p class="MsoNormal">While the ministry of internal affairs keeping mum, the
  police is also keeping mum. So far they have recovered two heavy choppers (one
  was however found by a group of students when they went to the place to place
  flower wreaths today, which was handed over to the VC, DU from whom police
  collected it later) from the place of occurrence. The police have arrested one
  Abbas Ali, said to be a student of political science from near the central
  Shahid Minar, but police is not sure if he is really involved. .<span>&nbsp;
  &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4"><u><span>Epilogue</span></u>:</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Let us join together to pray for speedy recovery of Dr.
  Humayun Azad. We need him desperately, yes more than we need Begum Khaleda,
  our great lady of maidan. Yes, if we lose Dr. Azad (God forbid), surely a void
  would be created in our intellectual field and it would be difficult to
  fulfill. But for any reason the pm steps down or voluntarily quits the job, I
  am sure no void would felt in our national life. The country will loose
  nothing. There would be no void even in the political field. Her son will
  immediately step in.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Who is the next target of the golden boys Begum Khaleda
  of whom she is so proud off. Remember our readers, our Prime minister, once
  uttered a stern warning against Sheikh Hasina and her party AL that to tame
  them, BNP is not needed, BNP Cadres belonging to students- and youths-front
  are quite competent to eliminate AL and its leaders. Madam PM, No amount of
  shading crocodile tears on the part of the PM, by pronouncing whatever needed
  for treatment of Dr. Azad would be done, would help the BNP nor help us.
  Better, the PM should control her unruly boys, and free each section of the
  administration from political interference from the lowest to the highest. We
  will feel relieved, but the threatening and thundering warnings radiating from
  the voice of the PM from maidan meetings really frighten us. Amin!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
