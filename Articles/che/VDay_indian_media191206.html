	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Indian media and news recalled the 
	glorious 16th December today. They remembered it as THEIR victory day 
	against Pakistan. They call it their victory in the &quot;Indo-Pak War&quot; and there 
	is no mention of Bangladesh at all! No mention of the enormous struggle and 
	sacrifice -- no mention of the Pakistani genocide or the valiant 9 month 
	liberation war that the people of Bangla had waged against the Jihadi 
	Pakistanis! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On one NEWS channel in India they 
	showed the original footage from Bangladesh with the original revolutionary 
	flag of Bangladesh flying but why do you think they did not even mention 
	Bangladesh? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">WHY IS THE INDIAN MEDIA TRYING TO 
	HIDE THE TRUTH? Is it because they don't have the same glory -- because they 
	did not have to earn their independence at such a high price as Bangladesh! 
	The British may have GIVEN India independence but Bangladesh had to EARN it! 
	Bangalis fought and the Vietnamese fought against militarily superior 
	enemies and they earned their victories. India did not have to do the same. 
	Are they jealous or is it part of a larger scheme? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most Indian Subcontinentals may have 
	forgotten but Mukto-Monas should remember that, in fact, it was the Bangalis 
	who fought for Indian independence too before the polite British handed over 
	power to their friends and cut up the Bangla country and divvied it up 
	between India and Pakistan! What are the Indians trying to hide -- glory of 
	Bangla lest the deculturized Bangalis of both Bengals and elsewhere suddenly 
	wake up and realize they are one nation and recall their glorious roots? 
	Already most Bangalis have forgotten past glory... Do they want Bangalis 
	forget their most recent history too? Do they want to destroy further the 
	nationhood of Bangla? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now here is a bit of history that I 
	am sure many will be unaware of and will be react against. Mukto-Monas 
	should know the following if they are truly Mukto-Monas. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to de-classified files of 
	the US, the Indian ambassador, Singh, had met a US official before India 
	entered into the war. There both had agreed that Bangladesh's independence 
	was a mere eventuality but Bangladesh would be under the control of forces 
	not under their control -- meaning the leftists. Singh had said that they 
	wanted Awami League in power and Mujib was optional. Then India entered the 
	war directly (only in December, a fortnight before victory)... So were their 
	intentions so honourable? According to both the US and India and Ataul Goni 
	Osmani and other real leaders of the liberation war, independence was 
	inevitable even before India entered the war. Why then do you think India 
	entered the war? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And then why do you think Pakistan 
	was not made to surrender to the valiant Bangalis who had fought so hard and 
	was poised for victory without the Indians? Now do not repeat that story of 
	a high ranking officer! The Pakistanis were surrendering -- why should they 
	dictate conditions? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">More History that is forgotten: 
	Indians avoided clashing with the Pakistani forces and were guided safely to 
	Dhaka by freedom fighters. They had one major battle with the Pakistanis and 
	14000 Indian troops died in total. Compare that to the 3 million Bangalis 
	who died! It is very criminal of India to hog all credit for victory. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to Ataul Goni Osmani, the 
	supreme commander of the pro- Awami + allies Muktibahini, Bangladesh was 
	close to victory before the Indians had arrived and that his guerrillas were 
	already entering Dhaka. There were other Mukti guerrilla groups also 
	entering Dhaka at the time. Pakistan was on the defensive by then. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">AND when the Pakistanis surrendered 
	India MADE SURE that they surrender to the Indians and not the Bangladeshis. 
	Osmani said in an interview that he was kept in the dark about the imminent 
	surrender of Pakistan and was deliberately kept away from Dhaka by the 
	Indians. AND HERE IS SOMETHING that not many know: There was an attempt on 
	Osmani's life on the 16th December! AND NO, Osmani does not suspect the 
	Pakistanis for this attempt! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There was a conspiracy... Open your 
	eyes and don't cheat yourselves by rejecting this as another conspiracy 
	theory! Bangladeshis have been lied to long enough. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The world does injustice to 
	Bangladesh's glorious war and Pakistan's henious Jihadi genocide. Go to 
	India and the rest of the world. Their history of Bangladesh's independence 
	avoids recording the liberation war and the genocide. They record it mostly 
	as a war between India and Pakistan and that India gave Bangladesh the gift 
	of independence... that is how the world knows Bangladesh's 1971! The blood 
	and sacrifice of millions won Bangladesh's independence, it was not not a 
	beggarly gift from anyone! </font></p>

	Unfortunately it is not known much beyond the borders of Bangladesh. Even in 
	West Bengal the glory of 1971 is devalued by their belief that India GAVE 
	Bangladesh her independence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Resist this cultural war against

	<p>-Biplab Pal 12/18/06 </p>
	<p>Before I started gulping my first coffee in the morning, I kind of 
	stumbled into this article blaming India once again for not giving due 
	recognition to the freedom fighters from Bangladesh on 16th December. This 
	time allegation is blatant-Indian media never said the word Bangladesh in V 
	day! </p>
	<p>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/38295 </p>
	<p>Author writes: </p>

	Pakistani genocide or the valiant 9 month liberation war that the people of 
	Bangla had waged against the Jihadi Pakistanis! </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>I am surprised that author diatribes such an allegation without any 
	evidence. Truth is quite opposite and I am presenting counter evidence. I am 
	living in US and therefore, I can not speak about TV media but Indian 
	Newspapers always remember the victory day with full glory of new 
	Bangladesh. I am giving this year’s coverage from rediff.com which is having 
	by far the largest readership among Indian eNewspapers ( It is ranked at 69 
	in Alexa as the largest internet based newspaper in India claiming 4million 
	readership a day-10 times more than Hindusthan Times in the net) </p>
	<p>http://www.rediff.com/news/bangla06.html </p>
	<p>Please see its coverage in the appendix- you would find it speaks the 
	stories of both sides more comprehensively and truthfully than many of the 
	Islamic media in Bangaldesh which even does not recognize India’s support 
	during freedom fight of ’71. Forget about that-too much to ask for from a 
	nation plagued by Islamic existentialism, but how many times people of 
	Bangladesh have seen the face of Mujib in TV on 16th Dec during Ershad and 
	BNP rule? </p>
	<p>Making such false allegation makes me sad and upset. More so because in 
	my childhood I have seen during the time of Ershad, BTV [which I could 
	access because I used to live close to Kustiya Border in those days ] never 
	mentioned India’s name or for that matter Sheikh Mujib or Tajuddin or Awami 
	League’s name on 16th Decemeber. What a shame for a country whose official 
	media even can not honor the best sons of the soil ( forget about the 
	friends) ! And now they came to blame India when India always published at 
	least one photo of Sheikh Mujib on 16th ! Bangladesh media even didn’t 
	recognize him for a long time!! Instead of feeling grateful that we have 
	honored their father of nation when the official Bangladesh media sent him 
	out in oblivion, author is charging us back! And the truth is, it is the 
	Government of Bangladesh that does not recognize the valiant effort of their 
	freedom fighters because then people will know what kind of crimes can be 
	committed by their Muslim brotherhood. Shame and more shame! Anyhow, I am 
	not interested in this kind of discussion because truth always takes its own 
	toll. Indeed, it is on roll for Bangaldesh-official media suppressed the 
	history of Islam during the war and it has bitten it back badly. That’s what 
	will always happen if the media can not speak the truth fearing Islamic 
	backlash. </p>
	<p>Unless Bangladeshis get out of this mode of blaming and grousing against 
	India for anything and everything and do not see how religion of Islam has 
	captivated them from truth and prosperity, I see a very a little hope for 
	Bangladesh.</p>

	<p>Dear Biplab: While your potryal of BTV's apathetic attitude in not 
	boradcasting/highlighting Sheikh Mujib during Zia-Ershad-Khaleda regime is 
	very true; I, for one, cannot side with you in defense of Indian newspapers 
	in that they highlight Bangladesh whenever talking or featuring 1971 
	liberation war. During my five years ('93 to '98) stay in India, I was an 
	avid reader of Times of India, Deccan Herald, The Hindu, Indian Express. As 
	I clearly remember, to almost all of those newspapers, 1971 liberatons war 
	is just a &quot;Indo-Pak war&quot; that led to the brith of Bangladesh. All my friends 
	who otherwise loved and enjoyed our stay in India were equally upset over 
	this mentality shown by the Indian newspapers. </p>

	<p align="justify">Well, I would like to agree with Jahed here. To portray 
	liberation war of 71 just as “Indo-Pak war” is just a distortion of facts 
	propagated by Indian media. Now cable TV and internet are within our reach, 
	its clearly visible that India wanted to see the episode as just their 
	victory over Pakistan (by parting Bangladesh out of Pakistan). </p>
	<p align="justify">Again, Bangladesh also failed to recognize the supreme 
	sacrifice of the Indian armies who fought in our land. We failed to build 
	any monument to show our respect and gratitude towards them. Let’s not 
	forget this. </p>

	<p>I agree it is a shame we do not honour india's contributions. It upsets 
	me that we are closer to Pakistan now days than India. Personaliy I think we 
	have so much in common with India while there is very little with Pakistan, 
	most Bangladeshis do not even share Pakistan's version of Islam. I accept 
	there are problems with India, and India should be more generous to its 
	smaller brother. </p>
	<p>I also regret the Islamisation of Bangladesh, I do not want Bangladesh to 
	lose its Hindu heritage. It is part of my childhood, going to Puja the 
	rituals etc...having fun... </p>
	<p>Do you think if Bangladesh was invaded tomorrow by Pakistan they would 
	still curse Bangladeshis for being too Hindu? To me that curse is a source 
	of pride. </p>
