  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><i><font color="#008000">There is
    nothing divine about morality, it is a purely human affair. (Albert
    Einstein, The Religiousness of Science)&nbsp;</font></i><o:p>
    </o:p>
    </span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Morality is not the property of
  religion or religious leaders. Morality is relative, subjective and collective
  notions of right and wrong that develops naturally. It varies from culture to
  culture, society to society and from era to era. It exists in non-human
  societies too, as recent studies on primates show. It varies from culture to
  culture and from one time to another.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The morality of religion is a fixed,
  rigid and a stagnant and absolute set of rules, given by some ancient tyrants
  (preachers and rulers) who wanted to have their way, added to some morality
  peculiar to some culture of a bygone era and fixed place. This is imposed on
  others through time with the bluff of divine authority or other means.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Purely unique religious rules that
  have no relevance to morality such as drinking of alcohol or eating pork or
  beef are pushed as part of morality. This is done either directly by using
  divine authority or indirectly by justifying it using questionable logic,
  which is the modern practice. These and other rules that encourage slavery,
  genocide and degradation of women are the rules added by the tyrants who are
  elevated to demi-gods by followers. It is a piggyback ride. The rules of the
  religious leaders are placed with existing notions of right and wrong, which
  are more generally accepted, and packaged into one divine morality system. It
  is a “take it all or you are immoral” deal.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">This imposition by force or divine
  blackmail is done even if that set of morality is incongruous to the reality
  of the culture and time period on which it is being imposed. For example,
  imposing the hijab on some tribe whose members do not even wear clothes would
  be such a case. Declaring dating to be immoral in a country like the US and
  stoning to death of a girl who goes on a date with a guy she likes would be
  another. (A Muslim cleric while driving by a bar and watching scantily clad
  girls walk around with guys made some scarey remarks.)&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Some society might have a very
  different idea of right and wrong but a conquering religion would oust their
  ideas labeling them as wrong to evil. The divine authoritarians claim to
  “improve” and “civilize” the society of “savage and immoral”
  people by imbuing the people with their “morality”. The only result of the
  imposition, however, is a destruction of an unique culture. Imposition of one
  culture’s morality on another is cultural genocide.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">For example, there is a matriarchal
  tribal society in China, where there are no fixed marriages and women and
  girls have sex with different male partners as per their choice. In fact,
  marriage and fixed relationships are considered immoral there. Their system
  makes sense of ownership and jealousy irrelevant. If Islam, Christianity, or
  some other preachy religion somehow conquered them through missionary work or
  other means, they would surely impose marriage laws on them. They would end
  the no marriage system, which works very well for the tribe by declaring the
  Christian or Muslim morality to be superior and divine. How is that improving
  conditions? Rather once property and jealousy becomes relevant, in will seep
  all other forms of corruption and hatred. It would end the peaceful existence
  of that culture.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">When religious morality is imposed
  upon someone (usually from early childhood), one takes it as an external rule
  and this morality does not come from within. So naturally, it is artificial
  and depends on fear and greed (hell and heaven). Such morality is bound to be
  pretence only as is seen so vividly among many religious and pious people.
  Many such people feel that it is “alright” if they can get away with it.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Religious morality is second hand
  morality; religion itself is second hand opinion. Society has not been
  improved by this second hand morality, religious morality. Even after
  millennia of religious brainwashing we need huge jails and elaborate legal
  systems. This is a testament of the failure of religion and religious
  morality.</span></p>
