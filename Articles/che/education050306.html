	<p align="justify"><br>
	<font face="Verdana">The first thing to notice about education in Bangladesh 
	is the culture of memorisation... and second, the culture of cheating. This 
	is true for all levels of education. From early in life a student has to 
	learn and master the art of memorisation and cheating if s/he wants to do 
	well in the existing discouraging system.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Why do students memorise?</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Just for a quick example: what is 
	the worth of memorizing dates and events in history? A person who memorizes 
	dates probably soon forgets the dates and even if he does not forget them – 
	what positive function does memorization play in our modern world apart from 
	theatre and the like? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In ancient times, memorization was 
	the key method of preserving knowledge, but now? Now we have books that 
	record the history and moreover TODAY, we even have computer databases that 
	stores MUCH more information and makes information more accurately and 
	instantly available. A student memorising the dates and events (Hafez of 
	history) is simply wasting his brain and time. If I need accurate 
	information, I can always go to a database or a book… the hafez is 
	unnecessary and superfluous! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Memorization is not needed in 
	History classes. What is required is the study of events in an analytical 
	way. A teacher and his/her class should analyse the preceding events leading 
	to a certain event and the consequences of that certain event. The class 
	must be allowed to see how this event is placed in the big picture – the 
	myriad of histories of our world. Then the events and the analysis should be 
	correlated to events in the present day. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The same is true in language 
	classes. What purpose does it serve to memorize an essay? None! The purpose 
	of a language class is to enable a student to formulate and express own 
	thoughts clearly and in a well organised form in the language being learned. 
	Note also that a student cannot learn a language by learning grammar. 
	Grammar is an analysis of the structure of a language and a child does not 
	learn his/her parents’ language by learning that structure? Memorisation is 
	the norm for other classes as well and some will surely argue that 
	memorisation is absolutely required for some of these classes. In the world 
	of medicine, students are made to memorise. Doctors will say it is vital 
	that one memorises certain data. However, even here, it is not absolutely 
	necessary. As a person works with medicine, the person will automatically 
	gradually remember a lot without memorising. What s/he cannot remember, s/he 
	can always look up in a database. What a doctor should learn is the 
	principles involved. I suspect some Muktomonas will disagree… </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In all the above cases it is the 
	failure of the teacher to TEACH (explain and make the student understand the 
	subject matter) that results in the culture of memorisation. The failure 
	(the so called teacher) probably himself does not fully understand the 
	principles involved and the implications of the principles (as I have seen 
	in many cases) and so takes the simplest way out and asks students to 
	memorise. Moreover, most of these teachers do not like to entertain 
	questions by students since they do not posses the understanding themselves 
	to be able to answer questions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These so called teachers know no 
	alternative to memorising. Their teachers made them memorise and they are 
	just continuing what they learned. Some teachers who might wish to teach 
	otherwise are rendered helpless by the rules and requirements of the 
	education board and the other teachers who will grade his/her students in 
	future national exams. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Students memorise because they are 
	given no alternative by teachers and the education board. Memorization is 
	the binding force/relationship between dim-witted professors and their 
	dim-witted students. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Why do they cheat?</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the amount of memorisation 
	becomes overwhelming for the student (too many subjects with huge syllabi) 
	the student naturally looks for short cuts. This calls for suggestions and 
	also the leakage (sales) of actual question papers. This also calls for 
	innovative methods of cheating – the same innovativeness of which the 
	teacher and the education board could have made proper use. The cheating 
	ranges from taking pieces of papers with notes and even writing notes on 
	shirts, hands, legs and desktops to copying and discussing. Sometimes even 
	invigilators help (pre-paid or post-paid). It is even rumoured LOUDLY, so 
	loud that it is screamed, that the marks obtained by a student can be 
	increased (manipulated) by certain people in return for monetary 
	compensation. The situation is said to prevail in the public universities 
	too. Students cheat because it is the only alternative (to memorising 
	impossible amounts) left to them. It is the easier way out. The 
	responsibility again falls on the teachers and those who set the syllabi.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus the teacher in the present 
	system teaches very little and the student learns very little other than 
	cheating. So a student who stands (top 20 students) in the S.S.C. or the 
	H.S.C. (National High School Examinations) is not necessarily the most 
	learned/intelligent etc. of the batch but the best at memorising and/or 
	cheating! And a student, however bright s/he may be, may even fail in such a 
	decadent system if s/he is not good at either! Memorisation encourages 
	cheating and discourages thinking. And this system produces unthinking 
	generations of cheating future leaders. (I can already hear fotwas by 
	students who did well under the current system condemning me!) In such a 
	situation, one cannot hope for a lot. The best cheaters of a generation will 
	come to the front and be the leaders of the society in this system. The big 
	heads of the education department and the teachers have created an evil 
	cycle which is detrimental to the society and the students! Their system 
	does not bring out the brightest kids of the country to the front but the 
	best cheaters and memorizers. How can one expect Bangladesh to progress? 
	(The credit of any progress goes to those who despite the system have 
	genuinely learned something and not cheated and may be, the pull from the 
	outside progressing world.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So when a teacher of the University 
	of Dhaka claims that the best and brightest students of the land make it to 
	his class when he is totally aware of the system and also of the rampant 
	cheating going on in his class, I tremble in despair! (I think it should be 
	noted that he is a big adherent of the memorisation school, to be just to 
	other teachers.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>What is the solution?</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A student of the National University 
	said that the education standards of the English medium schools and 
	universities are much better and so the right solution is to make the medium 
	of all education English. Is this a good solution? A Dhaka University 
	Journalism student then disagreed and said that this solution of eliminating 
	Bangla medium was like curing a headache by chopping off the head! I agree!
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The problem is not with the language 
	of instruction! How can it be? I have studied in two different language 
	mediums and it is not the language that is the obstacle but the system. If 
	we change the language but keep every other element in the system the same – 
	the only difference will be that the students will learn English better and 
	not learn Bangla that well. There is also a fear, in making every 
	institution English medium, that there will be greater inferiority complex 
	sweeping the country and Bangla will be considered, by most, inferior to 
	English. (Some English medium students already believe so.) Seeing how 
	advanced western technology and economy is, it is natural that many get an 
	inferiority complex. Some even feel the need to disassociate themselves from 
	the “primitiveness” of Bangla (in all its dimensions, including clothes) and 
	associate more with the west! And since the English speakers dominate the 
	world, naturally English to them is the language of the superiors and thus a 
	superior language. When they see that the students who are better at English 
	have a greater chance at going abroad and get better paying jobs – they see 
	this as a confirmation that the medium of instruction at educational 
	institutions should be English. Anyway, this is sheer inferiority complex 
	and I shall thus ignore it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If students were taught the glory 
	that was Bangla and how it was robbed, may be, there would be less people 
	with the inferiority complex. (Just as a bit of information, the glorious 
	history of Bangla is not a fiction or imagination to satisfy one’s 
	nationalist ego as a Press Institute of Bangladesh officer said but it is 
	factual history. The text books of Bangladesh, for some mysterious reason, 
	may avoid reference to the era when Bangla was great but the history is 
	available for those who are interested. Those who are ignorant of this 
	history need to stop and learn the history of Bangla before making big 
	statements! Just because the US State Department claims that Bangladesh was 
	always a stagnant (backwaters) nation, it does not become true!) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not the language of 
	instruction but the system where we should drive our attack against if we 
	want to improve things! I will make a layman attempt since I am not an 
	expert in educational systems and will leave the serious nitty-gritty to the 
	learned educationist, hoping against hope, that they are not rigid 
	memorizers and cheaters. There are 3 things that I see where change is 
	needed. I am sure many others see them too and if you see any other needs 
	please add them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First, the system in the 
	universities and schools are extremely rigid. A student has little 
	independence in choosing his/her educational path in the current rigid 
	system. A student at the S.S.C. or H.S.C. level can choose their department: 
	Science, Arts or Commerce but after that the choice of subjects is not very 
	flexible. They have to take 10 different subjects all at once, and with very 
	little choice as to what the 10 subjects will be. And the students have to 
	study in great depth and memorise huge amounts of data in subjects in which 
	they have little or no interest or subjects which has little or no relevance 
	to his/her choice of field of future study. Here we can borrow the flexible 
	structure from the Ordinary Level Examination system of the University of 
	London. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the university level, a student 
	at a public university in Bangladesh has no flexibility in choosing courses 
	as in universities around the world. (Probably Shahjalal University is the 
	only exception.). A student should be allowed to choose his own courses 
	(subject to pre-requisites) and the number of courses to take in a SEMESTER. 
	This means that the public universities must introduce a semester system 
	instead of a year system to avoid the session jam that exists. Here the 
	flexibility should be borrowed from universities in other countries. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Second, the format of studying and 
	testing should be changed from memorisation and broad/essay questions to 
	understanding principles and intelligent questions requiring the use of the 
	knowledge of the principles. The system should enable the student to 
	understand the underlying principles and their implications and apply this 
	knowledge in solving problems. Little or no stress should be given on 
	memorisation. This should be done both at school and university levels.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To change the existing format, we 
	need to get rid of the big heads in the education department and the big 
	headed teachers who advocate memorising from the school to the university 
	level. These so called teachers are not teachers… they are cheaters. They 
	cheat the students of learning. So chuck them out! (smile) This, I am sure, 
	won’t be accomplished all that easily. At finally address the fact that 
	there are very few well rounded books in Bangla that are suitable for study 
	at the different levels. If we do not have great intellectuals in a certain 
	field to write books of quality in Bangla, then we need to simply translate 
	books – and there are good translators in Bangladesh who have enough 
	knowledge in English </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The system and teachers force 
	students to memorise in the existing rigid system. Students are overwhelmed 
	and bored and look for an easy way out – they cheat. A culture of cheating 
	is created. And thus the system produces unthinking but clever cheaters as 
	leaders of the future. Changing the language of instruction can not change 
	this situation. Changing the system is required. Books of quality must be 
	made available in Bangla in all subjects. Rigidity should be relaxed in 
	choosing courses. Syllabi and the method of teaching and testing, as said 
	above, both in the high school and the university levels should be changed 
	drastically. And only then can we expect to bring out the brilliance in the 
	brilliant kids of our country.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
	<b>Post Conclusion</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As an afterthought, we have to 
	extend the opportunity of quality education to all in the villages… many of 
	the greatest brains of Bangla are being lost in the villages due to lack of 
	opportunity. If the system is changed and extended, more brilliant minds 
	will come forth increasing the pace of Bangladesh’s progress.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Post Post Conclusion</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Madrasah system is given equal 
	status to the other systems but do not have syllabi at all tailored to the 
	modern world. Students from these systems will have no chance if the other 
	normal system is fixed. May be, only one secular system should prevail where 
	a course on comparative religion is taught and this course should be 
	optional like all other courses. </font><i> <br>
