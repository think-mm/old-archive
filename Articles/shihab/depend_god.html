	power for safe them up, but no God or super power extended its blessings. It 
	is human beings who came to safe another human lives. So, if there is 
	someone to respect, it is almost human being.<br>
	<br>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the modern world those nations 
	are dominated by religion, backwardness is the integral part of their life. 
	The people form society, so people will change and develop everything; there 
	is no need to depend on god or any religions. </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><br>
		1. Although at the beginning of civilization there were no god but at 
		the commencement of middle age some people created the idea of god, the 
		almighty, personally and collectively every people face different 
		problems, some of them can overcome and some problems became difficult 
		for them. It is a general observation that in every era problem is 
		always stronger then solution procedure, at the moment the disease AIDS 
		is more difficult problem than present medication arrangements. On the 
		basis of this issue some religious and missionary of church are trying 
		to mislead the people and trying to convince them in favor of religion 
		by saying AIDS as a curse of almighty. It is mention here that once 
		smallpox, diarrhea, black fever and plague was the great danger for 
		humanity but at the moment this is not a problem at all, we strongly 
		hope that within a short time the medical scientist will invent the 
		medicine of AIDS. The practice of religion is not the solution of that 
		case. But for the time being Government and non-government agencies 
		should create the awareness to combat against AIDS. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Similarly, after independence 
		of our country the government was not enough capable to lead the nation 
		in right direction, people suffer in various ways such as to fulfill 
		their basic needs. Beside this the power occupied by the military, 
		unjust killing, violation of civil and political rights of citizens and 
		imposes autocracy on the nation hampered human living. During the 
		dictatorship our Bangle society fallen on a worst situation. People 
		always waiting for the blessings of god, but god dose not remove the 
		autocrat until the massive movement of students and workers jointly and 
		the glorious death of Dr. Millon. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. While American troops were 
		severely bombing on Afghanistan and Iraq than all Muslim ummah were 
		crying and prayed to Allah for saving them in every mosque. That was 
		also a month of Ramadan, In the Qu’ran Allah said that “Uduni 
		fastajiblahom” that means ‘call me directly and I will response at once’ 
		but no response were got from the almighty. The great prophet of Islam 
		also said any kind of prayer would be accepted to God without delay in 
		the month of Ramadan. But the almighty did not maintain its commitment 
		to protect the Muslims. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4. Some people advice that if we 
		follow the religion our stresses of daily life would be removed and 
		shifted, that would also keep ensure our sanity. Infect this concept is 
		not right but the practice of religion reduces the working spirit of 
		people, lead them idle life, in this idle life they hatching different 
		types of criminal interventions. Which increases more stress among them.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5. Once drought and flood fully 
		destroyed our agricultural sector, in that period people offered 
		different types of religious activities and sacrifices and also cried to 
		Allah for rain, but Allah never help the people to improve their 
		agriculture and irrigation system. There is an angel, named Mikhail of 
		Islam, responsible for rain and storm management. Now a day’s people 
		develop irrigation system for their agriculture, fisheries and 
		livestock, so there is no need to depend on angels, Mikhail. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6.In the modern age 
		industrialization is the important sector for creation of employment, 
		third world are in backward in this sector, lots of men and woman are 
		unemployed, they are suffering from various problems, the unemployed 
		people always prayed to all mighty but a very few people get the job. 
		Those who get job have strong jack to high ups of particular posts or 
		pay a huge of bribe. There is no contribution of god. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">7. In most countries, transports 
		start journey by the name of almighty and the passengers also prayed to 
		God to save them from accidents. Though after conducting of praying to 
		super power, there sometimes happened road accident and lots of people 
		lost their lives. The crying of the victims never hard to the 
		“Sumiumbachir” meaning whom hard all things, people improvising their 
		trafficking system by their own initiative. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">8. Lack of good governance and 
		proper implementation of human rights in the third world countries and 
		absence of role of law people suffer various way, such as terrorism, 
		repression, and torturing and so on, people crying and appeal to god for 
		their emancipation but so far there is no evidence that god help to 
		remove the terror or repressions. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">9. Some curious people often 
		raise question, such as (1) who I m? (2) Who created me? (3) What is my 
		duty? These are not new questions at all, these are very old and already 
		been answered several times. The simple answers of these questions are 
		we are an animal as well as rational being. Rationality is not developed 
		equally in all human being; it is based upon atmosphere, education and 
		culture. Infect we are not created by some one rather we are evaluated 
		from a singled cell living things. And finally we would be agreed that 
		our duty is not predetermined in the world, which determined by the 
		society, people performed their duty according to their own position 
		capacity and social status. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is concluded here that there is 
	no need to depend on god for living in the world. People should develop 
	themselves as demand of time, with education, skills, and culture. </font>
