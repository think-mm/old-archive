  <p>Begum Rokeya, in her article, &quot;In The Maidan of Hajj&quot;, wrote, &quot;During Hajj, 
  men and women have equitable rights. Both are wearing same unstitched two 
  pieces of dress. There is no lace of golden threads, no covered `Burkha' of 
  any new fashion, not even the hooded palanquin. The wives and the daughters of 
  the highborn aristocrats have to run between Safa and Marwa on foot; 
  circumambulate the Qu'aba Sharif. At those moments shoving and jostling with 
  the males are inevitable. Why not the Indian noble aristocrats introduce a 
  separate private day of Hajj for women &quot;living in Purdah&quot;? We could know how 
  heroic they are if they could impose a separate day of Hajj, as they do 
  reserve a separate day for functions or exhibitions etc. in Kolkata for the 
  aristocratic women &quot;living behind the Purdah&quot;. In conclusion, I pray with all 
  my devotion, so that all Muslim women would be able to see the Maidan of Hajj 
  at least for once in their lifetime. &quot; (Published in monthly `Mohammadi' in 
  Bangla Year 1339- Roman Year 1936).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I shall extend my thanks to Mr. S. A. Hannan to post the commentary &quot;The 
  Feminist Debate Over Hijab&quot; authored by Ms. Anne Sofie Roald, Ph.D written on 
  the topic of Hijab,<br>
  </p>
  <p>[<i>Ref: <a href="http://www.messageonline.org/2004febmarch/cover2_opt.pdf">
  http://www.messageonline.org/2004febmarch/cover2_opt.pdf</a> </i>], <br>
  </p>
  <p>in his message of Dahuk Forum </p>
  <p>[<i>Ref:</i> <i><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dahuk/message/3569">
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dahuk/message/3569</a></i>].<br>
  <br>
  I strongly believe that, Mr. S. A. Hannan is aware of Begum Rokeya Sakhawat 
  Hossain, who is regarded as the pioneer of &quot;Muslim Feminism&quot; in our part of 
  the World. Indeed we are indebted to Begum Rokeya alongwith her co-travelers 
  who dedicated their lives during the early part of the Twentieth Century to 
  emancipate the Muslim Women from the claws of &quot;Purdah System&quot; imposed by the 
  aristocratic Muslims leaders of India for centuries to keep the women confined 
  to indoor domestic peripheries. As the result of Feminist movements initiated 
  by Begum Rokeya and others the Muslim Women could gradually begin to break the 
  barrier of &quot;Purdah System&quot; and grab the opportunity to become educated and to 
  seize the opportunity to enter into participating in the Public life.<br>
  </p>
  <p>It is always the trend of the orthodox Islamists to be critical about 
  Feminism be it either Muslim Feminism, when the Muslim Feminists have always 
  strived to point out the discriminating attitude of the patriarchy which 
  originates in the misleading interpretations of the tenets of Islam. Due to 
  their misleading propaganda, the Muslim Feminists always had been subject to 
  undue criticisms. The orthodox Islamists are, out and out patriarchal, as they 
  represent the vested interest and are looking at the World through their 
  distorted lens of patriarchy, where on the other hand Islam has clearly 
  pointed out to set the direction to end it. Also, at a date as early as in the 
  7th Century of the Roman calendar.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this respect indeed which the Muslim orthodoxy further failed to realize 
  that the steps which were necessary to emancipate and empower the women 
  relative to the times of the early Caliphate which were prescribed at those 
  times were not meant to be the end of it, but that only the beginning of it.<br>
  </p>
  <p>Ms. Anne is a Muslim woman, educated, living in Sweden and by profession an 
  Associate professor at Malmo University in Sweden. May be she is not aware of 
  what Begum Rokeya Shakhawat Hossain wrote back in the early twentieth century. 
  Modern Sweden is a country in Western Europe known as to be the freest country 
  as regards to sex, which Muslim Feminist will be critical about. But, it will 
  be difficult to be critical with regard to gender relations in Sweden. 
  Because, not only considering the dignity and respect which prevails in the 
  mutual gender relationships in that country but according to the available 
  statistics also they have been able to establish by far one of the foremost 
  society in which the women enjoy the most equitable opportunity and 
  participation in almost all of the public spheres of life and contributing 
  extensively for the equitable development of the society.<br>
  </p>
  <p><br>
  Ms. Anne in her book, &quot;Women In Islam: The Western Experience.&quot; commented, &quot;A 
  Christian nun wearing a veil might be seen as image of sincerity, religiosity, 
  purity and peace, whereas a Muslim women wearing a veil is likely to be seen 
  as a symbol of the oppression of women and as making a political-religious 
  statement.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>Ms. Anne wears a headscarf as she has informed in her writings and 
  obviously she preferred to practice that. But definitely she is not living the 
  life similar to a &quot;Christian Nun&quot;, and if she did then also she may be 
  questioned on the practice of &quot;Clergy System&quot; which Islam does not encourage. 
  The dress of Christian Nun definitely is making a &quot;religious&quot; statement of its 
  Clergy System in which a Nun has a complete set of code of different life 
  style of living and livelihood from that of an ordinary Christian believing 
  woman. Therefore, her analogy made in this respect is definitely is a case of 
  failed substitution, misplaced as well as misjudged, hence may be termed by 
  some also as a misleading propaganda. I have no reason to defend or criticize 
  the dress of a Christian Nun because they are practicing that out of their own 
  faith of Clergy System, which is rather not present in the religious belief 
  system of Islam.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>Firstly, Ms. Anne has pointed out that, the argument of Muslim Feminists on 
  the question of &quot;Hijab&quot; suffers from &quot;selectivity&quot; in drawing reference from 
  the scriptures. Secondly, she further questions why the practice of 
  &quot;Headscarf&quot; is termed by the Muslim Feminists not applicable for the women in 
  general when; &quot;Khimar&quot; (24:30-31) and &quot;Jilbab&quot; (33:59) are ordained for all 
  women. Thirdly, she also questions: why the Muslim Feminists look at wearing a 
  &quot;Headscarf&quot; as if it was meant for socio-political or religious activism?<br>
  <br>
  We all know, there is no dispute or misunderstanding with practicing a &quot;Khimar' 
  or &quot;Jilbab&quot;, because those do not include any kind of &quot;Headgear&quot; at all and 
  the dresses which are being commonly used by Muslim women are definitely 
  modest attires covering the parts of the body as ordained in those verses of 
  the Holy Quor'an.<br>
  </p>
  <p><br>
  But, the Arabic word &quot;Hijab&quot; (33:53) means physically a &quot;curtain&quot; or &quot;barrier&quot; 
  to be used by the Prophet's wives while meeting with men who were strangers or 
  distantly related. But then why the very word &quot;Hijab&quot; is being used commonly 
  to mean the &quot;Headscarf&quot;? If misnomer of &quot;Headscarf&quot; is created to simile with 
  &quot;Hijab&quot; then it was the &quot;Islamists&quot; rather than the Muslim Feminists created 
  that misnomer. But, was it made inadvertently, or a distortion made 
  intentionally, or there is a plausible intention and explanation behind the 
  creation of this particular misnomer? If there is one plausible intention or 
  explanation in favour of it then I hope such explanation should come from the 
  &quot;Islamists&quot; to corroborate it with the relevant references of scriptures to 
  clear the misunderstanding created by the misnomer, rather than falsely 
  criticizing the Muslim Feminists of being &quot;selective&quot; in making references.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>I believe Ms Anne is fully aware of the fact that the Muslim Feminists in 
  general are concerned about gender relations in the Muslim society, 
  particularly in those respects where the women are oppressed, discriminated or 
  segregated in the society. The objective of a Muslim Feminist is to make the 
  Muslim women aware and conscious about their problems with particular emphasis 
  to the social impediments persisting with respect to freedom for education, 
  marriage, child birth, family planning, mother and child health care, gender 
  violations, employment and any other impediments which put a curb to enjoy 
  their freedom of speech including other socio-political and economic rights 
  necessary to achieve and attain fair and equitable treatment in their private 
  and public life.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>The Muslim Feminists pursue to attain these objectives not as ends by 
  themselves but by far with all fair intentions so that women in general can 
  become able to attain a congenial social environment including at the 
  grassroots of the society to undertake all necessary and appropriate steps by 
  themselves to solve all these problems confronting them. Because only in doing 
  so they shall be able to ensure fair and equitable treatment for them in their 
  private and public life. The Muslim Feminists believe that, it is necessary to 
  create the social environment for the Muslim women which is congenial to 
  provide equal opportunity and justice for women, hence it becomes necessary to 
  emancipate the Muslim women from all kinds of male dominant postures and 
  positions existing in the Muslim societies.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>We also know that, modesty and modest dress are issues and the subjects 
  applicable for both men and women in a Muslim society. Hence the arguments 
  favouring the practice of &quot;Headscarf&quot; by Muslim women offering explanations of 
  complying with Quora'nic injunctions, or in the premises to gain 
  socio-economic advantage are both wrong as seen by the Muslim Feminists. 
  Because, neither it is complying with the Quor'anic injunctions nor it can 
  help to gain any socio-economic or political advantage except deteriorating 
  the situation in generating social tension through segregation in gender 
  relations. As long as the practice of &quot;Headscarf&quot; attributes to &quot;Hijab&quot; which 
  means &quot;Purdah&quot; and definitely &quot;segregation&quot;, which is definitely an imposition 
  of patriarchy.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>We cannot build a coherent society and aspire to make it harmonious, 
  vibrant and strong, with bifurcations created in gender relations in private 
  and public life. Islam and The Holy Prophet of Islam never wished to see a 
  society as a whole with bifurcated and segregated gender relations. And, it is 
  not difficult for one dedicated believer to understand it, if he or she shall 
  try to interpret the Holy Quor'an and the Traditions of Holy Prophet without 
  making any distortion. But, unfortunately, often and historically the 
  distorted interpretations of the Holy scriptures have been made to serve the 
  ill-motive of the vested interest groups who wished to further the male 
  dominant patriarchal Muslim society merely to satisfy themselves by treating 
  women in subjugation with ultimate goal of reducing the sphere of women into 
  the private places of domestic house keeping and sexual objectification.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>The value and sense of moral standard are created in human minds through 
  educative learning and intellectual refinement with humane understanding of a 
  coherent and disciplined social life, but in which both men and women must 
  participate with equal access to education and knowledge for proper learning 
  of these standards. Above all, wisdom is the most important element of human 
  intellectual virtues, which men and women should be able to equally acquire. 
  Wisdom accumulates from the knowledge gathered through perpetual application 
  of physical and mental faculties into the spiritual as well as worldly 
  affairs. Then how women would be able to acquire the virtues of wisdom unless 
  they are allowed to become able to enter freely and exercise their independent 
  minds into their day to day problems which they are confronting in their 
  private and public lives in relation to the society, the nation and the 
  contemporary world in which she is born?<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>Therefore, on the other hand, if one aspires to achieve these goals merely 
  concentrating all her/his mind and exhausting all energy in mere symbolic 
  practice of &quot;Headscarf&quot; for women, in that situation rather one is found to do 
  nothing but exactly that, ignorantly furthering &quot;Hijab&quot; or &quot;Purdah&quot; or 
  &quot;Segregation' in the society. Which is indeed originating from ethos of 
  imagery &quot;Feel Good&quot; attitude of being participant in orthodox patriarchal 
  version of Islamic socio- political and religious activism.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>With improper perspective of learning of worldly affairs as ordained, if 
  the women find them living in the nightmare of this World where Islam gets 
  reduced to closed and captivated state of the mind and the brain, into a mere 
  &quot;piece of cloth&quot; then Muslim Feminists should oppose it by all means and shall 
  continue to do so for the furtherance of the righteous path of Islam. Because, 
  the women are definitely co-traveler of the men in this path at the end of 
  which men and women shall be treated equally for their deeds in the matter of 
  final justice with the equitable verdict of Allah, and because, Allah knows 
  the best!<br>

  <p>Verses From Quor'an referring `Hijab':<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>33:53 O ye who believe! Enter not the Prophet's houses, - until leave is 
  given you, - for a meal, not to wait for its preparation: but when ye are 
  invited, enter; and when ye have taken your meal, disperse, without seeking 
  familiar talk. Such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet: he is ashamed to dismiss 
  you, but Allah is not ashamed (to tell you) the truth. And when ye ask his 
  ladies anything, ask them from behind a HIJAAB: that makes for greater purity 
  for your hearts and for theirs. Nor is it right for you that ye should annoy 
  Allah's Messenger, or that ye should marry his widows after him at any time. 
  Truly such a thing is in Allah's sight an enormity.<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>7:46- between them is a HIJAAB (barrier).<br>
  <br>
  </p>
  <p>17:45-And when you recite the Qur'an, We place between you and those who do 
  not believe in the hereafter a hidden HIJAAB. (Barrier)<br>
  <br>
  19:17-she (Maryam) took a HIJAAB (barrier) apart from them (her women folk)<br>
  </p>
  <p>38:32- and the sun was hidden behind a HIJAAB (barrier)</p>
  <p>41:5- between you and us is a HIJAAB (barrier)</p>
  <p>42:51- God does not speak to anyone except from behind a HIJAAB (barrier)<br>
  <br>
  </p>
