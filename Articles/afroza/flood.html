  <p>Bangladesh with a territory of 7% only of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
  basin taking the burden of flow of 92% of flood water flowing through her when
  it is the result of rainfall occurring outside Bangladesh in an area 15 times
  larger than Bangladesh herself,flood is inevitable<br>
  <br>
  The country is under grip of severe flood inundating about a third of the land
  and affecting or dislocating about 30 Millions. During April-May this year the
  country was experiencing hot and dry spells at a magnitude higher than those
  recorded during few of the previous years—similarly in India and Pakistan,
  too. Hence it was predictable that it will follow with jet stream of huge
  amount of moisture coming from Arab Sea and the Bay of Bengal bringing intense
  rainfalls and monsoon flooding the deltaic plane, the confluence of Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
  basin, that constitutes Bangladesh.<br>
  <br>
  Natural disaster, calamities and catastrophes are cohabiting phenomenon of
  human civilization. Modern science till today can explain the reason of
  earthquakes but could not find ways and means to forecast its occurrences but
  catching people with severe strikes unaware and surprised leading to
  devastating catastrophes of death and destruction. Almost similar phenomenon
  goes with the Tornados.<br>
  <br>
  Although it is predictable which months of the year are prone to these
  occurrences but the whim with which the Twisters choose the route, create
  their width, the speed; striking day, hour or minute of the severe whirlwind
  funneling off objects from the ground—is impossible to predict. The
  destruction is unavoidable and inescapable, but death can be escaped only
  hiding in underground shelters.<br>
  <br>
  But, this is not so in case of floods or cyclones. It is predictable well
  ahead-- looking and monitoring the changes of temperature, barometric
  pressure, humidity and directions of the movement of the air carrying the
  clouds, the movement and melting of the glaciers, rise and fall of water
  levels in the rivers and the seas of a target area.<br>
  <br>
  After just a few years of independence when the people of Bangladesh was still
  in rejoicing mood and dreaming of a vibrant and strong “Sonar Bangla”, the
  sudden flood and famine of 1974 taking lives of thousands, disenchanted and
  demystified the people so bad—the incumbents failure of disaster management
  had to face severe criticism and rage of the people giving all abundant chance
  and ample opportunity to the opposition forces to embarrass and brand the
  liberators of Bangladesh as failed managers incapable of governing the state
  to the point of question of viability of existence of independent Bangladesh.
  We had to swallow with shame, the words of self-assumed diplomatic authorities
  of the World cursing us as a “basket case”.<br>
  <br>
  It was a tremendous blow to our self-esteem, and more to the enthusiasm of
  “Sonar Bangla” facing that brute reality of famine and
  death—demystification of the myth, which we created through years of
  struggle and the liberation war. The British or the Punjabi’s never believed
  that we Bengalis can also be warriors to win a war challenging any force how
  formidable.<br>
  <br>
  The connection between cultural bigotry and political tyranny can also become
  very close. Commenting on the Bengal famine of the 40’s the great Churchill
  said that, “The Bengal famine of 1943 was caused by the tendency of the
  people out there to breed like rabbits.”—profoundly affecting the relief
  efforts during the disastrous famine. Henry Kissinger’s mote claim of
  terming independent Bangladesh as, “basket case”, created similar negative
  affect in the incoming relief efforts of the Government.<br>
  <br>
  In 1970, worst cyclone hit the coastal area of Bangladesh taking lives nearly
  of a million and then the famine of 1974, with all those horrendous pictures
  of starving skeletons of the living humans or the dead swollen bodies caught
  in the trees or the sandy beaches printed in the media-- painted, portrayed
  and flashed to the World the image of a country of cyclones, floods, famines
  and tropical diseases—indeed a “basket case” full of people “breeding
  like rabbits”-- a population of relief mongers –born to live only on pity
  of relief and assistance extended by the international club of the rich
  countries.<br>
  <br>
  However, the inherent will of the people of Bangladesh to combat, survive and
  construct an independent Bangladesh was tremendously underestimated then by
  the international community and even by the neighbours. The trauma of 1974 and
  the introduction of BAKSAL by the leaderships of war of independence confused
  and isolated the people creating favourable ground to hatch the conspiracy for
  the enemies of independence to stage the massacre of 15th August, 3rd and 7th
  November, 1975.<br>
  <br>
  In spite of all these could not altogether take away the resolute inspiration
  of the people to overcome the impediments and forge ahead to build the nation
  to earn the respect of the self-serving pessimists. The later history proves
  that to be true.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The 1974 famine taught us the first lesson—“do not depend on foreign aid
  or assistance for food and essentials to move the relief operation during
  flood or cyclone.” Hence, then on from 1975, the priorities of the
  successive Governments were to construct go-downs for food and relief
  materials and create a buffer stock.<br>
  <br>
  We learnt, for food we could not depend upon the pledges and promises of the
  foreign donors for assistance and wait for those assistances, which may come
  after months or years or may not come at all. So from then on, after each
  crop, the Government purchased rice or paddies and stored in those go-downs
  located at each administrative Police Station –even other relief materials
  at the central relief go-down in Dhaka.<br>
  <br>
  In this way, then on all the successive Governments held stock 2-3 Million
  Metric Tons of foods as buffer stock all along the year which not only made
  the Government capable to combat natural disaster but also gave the Government
  power to intervene into the market in case of regulation of price of food
  items became necessary.<br>
  <br>
  The second lesson we learnt, “Build shelters.” Multistoried cyclone and
  flood shelters were built integrating with school, college, and hospital
  construction programmes. In small towns, the community houses of the local
  Governments also were turned into multistoried multipurpose shelter units.<br>
  <br>
  The third lesson we learned, “Build coastal embankments and green belts.”
  Coastal embankments and forestation programmes were implemented at the coastal
  area to minimize damages occurring due to encroachment of the coast by
  incoming tidal surges at the time of cyclones.<br>
  <br>
  The fourth lesson we learnt, “ build spurs” at the places where the rivers
  are taking horseshoe bends. A number of river training programmes were
  implemented to control severe erosions at the most prone areas along the
  river.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, the flood of 1988 even was more severe than the flood of 1974-the
  cyclone of 1991 was more severe than 1970—but the deaths were insignificant
  reduced to few hundreds not even thousands against prediction of foreign media
  that millions of deaths shall occur.<br>
  <br>
  During 1998 flood BBC was fearing that at least two millions will die out of
  starvation, but there was not a single death going hungry or not having
  received the relief material for food and/or other essentials. The
  Government’s effort to combat the flood was then later was praised by the
  World press with notes of surprise.<br>
  <br>
  On the other hand at the end of 1998, Bangladesh, for the first time claimed
  autarky in food—the country that was plagued with food shortage from its
  birth and each year had to meet the shortage with food aid from foreign
  donors. From then on the food aid from foreign sources dropped to nil, and the
  government held buffer stock for the people to meet any proportion of disaster
  coming out from flood or cyclone.<br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh is no more a “basket case”, now having US $ 6.421 Billion
  annual earnings from export, a GDP growth rate of 5.5 % per annum, a saving
  rate of 24.49% and investment rate of 23.49 % of GDP, Human Development Index
  trend of increase at the rate of 1.76% per annum between
  1975(0.345)-2002(0.509), Gender Related Development Index of 0.499 and Gender
  Related Income Share is 76% which is even higher than India (50%) or Pakistan
  (44%).<br>
  <br>
  Similarly, no more “breeding like rabbits”—with an annual population
  growth of 1.5 % even below the World average of 1.6%. UNDP 2004 report has
  recognized Bangladesh in the list of seven of the best performing list of the
  countries achieving satisfactory rate of poverty reduction towards achieving
  Millennium Development Goal (MDG).<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, now when we are in the grip of severe flood today in 2004, the
  Government can say, “We do not need international relief now, but we shall
  need assistance for rehabilitation and restoration of damages of the
  infrastructures caused by the flood, only after the flood water recedes.”
  There were deaths of a few hundred due to some accidents –but anybody
  looking the Satellite image of the flood would fear death of millions if this
  flood would have occurred decades earlier.<br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh is an active delta at the confluence of three major rivers
  –Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna. Ganges and Brahmaputra have their origin in
  the Himalayas. Flood is inevitable, and severe flood can always occur in those
  monsoons when the all these three rivers rise simultaneously.<br>
  <br>
  Geographically Bangladesh is located in the tropical region at the tip of the
  funnel of Bay of Bengal, one of the largest bays of the Indian Ocean and hence
  cyclones are normal features of changing seasons in this region from long
  history of the past found in record. We have to live with these floods and
  cyclones, and we have to learn how to survive and live with them, with our own
  experience without hampering the pace and efforts of development.<br>
  <br>
  There is no permanent solution of to do away with the floods or cyclones. It
  is not necessary to make false promises. Begum Khaleda Zia should refrain from
  populace lectures when she is falsely promising to the victims of flood that
  her Government would find and implement permanent solution to do away with the
  recurring floods. Also she should refrain from stating that, flood brings
  alluvial soil enhancing fertility of the agricultural lands.<br>
  <br>
  This may be true in seasons of normal monsoons but in seasons of soaring
  flooding which is a case of this year, the tons of alluvial soil brings
  disaster to fill the river beds making the rivers erode their banks. She
  should leave these comments on merits or demerits of flood to be made by the
  scientists –and this is not her job. The responsibility of the Government is
  to save lives and hence to see that the relief materials reach the needy
  smoothly and effectively. For doing this Government should not depend on the
  administration only but also should integrate the elected public
  representatives and inspire people’s initiatives.<br>
  <br>
  In this year’s relief operation –the presence of people’s
  representatives undertaking relief operations and enthusiasm of the various
  political and socio-cultural humanist initiatives including activities of the
  NGOs are at very low ebb. It was the result of Governments policy to assert
  enhanced dependence on Government administration—the reason is unclear.<br>
  <br>
  In any case, this is not a prudent policy, because may be the initiative taken
  through the Government machinery may be enough at this point of time but if
  the situation worsens –since there is possibility of slow receding of flood
  water due to rise of sea level with the effect of full moon and also a second
  spell is being forecasted –and if that come by then the Government’s lone
  effort to raise and distribute relief materials through administrative
  channels only, may not suffice.<br>
  <br>
  Hence, it would be advisable to integrate the elected people’s
  representatives, the NGOs and the socio-cultural organizations and getting
  them engaged by the side of the Government in the task of relief mobilization
  as well as distribution.<br>
  <br>
  Although, it appears there is no scarcity of food items, but it is being
  reported that there are scarcity of Oral Saline, Water Purifying Tablets and
  Antibiotics etc. Immediate action is necessary to increase the production and
  supply of these essential medical items by the pharmaceutical industries,
  voluntary organizations and involvement of paramedics and the doctor’s
  organizations to get those made available to the relief shelters and camps.<br>
  <br>
  Moreover, the most important area where the relief distribution is getting
  hampered is due to lack of necessary numbers of water transports. The
  Government’s initiative is needed to make necessary mobilization of river
  transports from the Public and private sector so that relief reaches also in
  the areas, which are not accessible, by road. In this matter the unwise remark
  of the Finance Minister making discouraging effect on the initiatives of the
  NGOs is not expected at the time of national crisis where sense of cooperation
  should prevail.<br>
  <br>
  It is apparent that 20-30% of funds allocated in the current Fiscal Year’s
  ADP has to get diverted into the programmes for flood damage rehabilitation
  initiatives. At this point of time it is not clear whether the donors are
  offering grants or debts for flood damage rehabilitation. It is most likely
  that the donors are more inclined in the publicity rather than putting their
  pledges on realistic terms.<br>
  <br>
  In reality the donors would propose to divert a portion of the fund already
  pledged under 2004-05 ADP for flood damage rehabilitation schemes making it a
  separate component. Therefore it is not necessary for the Government also to
  give much importance on the additional debts if offered which is most unlikely
  but only consider those which come as Debt Relief Grants or pure grants for
  strengthening of flood disaster management and rehabilitation programmes.
  Without enhancing the size of the debt or the ADP already passed by the
  Parliament it would be rather more prudent to engage all effort to get 100% of
  the ADP implemented without falling short of a single Taka which is actually
  more important considering the past performance of not having got the full
  amount of ADP utilized last year, due to slackness of implementation
  initiatives.<br>
  <br>
  A very important point, and indeed which looks alarming that, the interval
  period of years between two occurrences of severe floods are getting reduced.
  We have normal flooding in each year, but the abnormal flood occurs when heavy
  rainfalls are recorded in the West, North and the East happening
  simultaneously flooding all the three tributaries i.e. Ganges, Brahmaputra and
  Meghna with rise of water levels above danger levels, as well as, when this
  phenomenon gets associated with rise of water level in the bay due to lunar
  cycle or other reason like global warming.<br>
  <br>
  The year lines of occurrences of this particular set of inter-related
  phenomenon with simulated characteristics as recorded in near past that caused
  severe flood are, 1955, 1974, 1988, 1998 and now in 2004. That shows the gaps
  are getting reduced in alarming rate. If this trend continues then in not very
  distant future we may have to experience severe flooding occurring in each of
  the years during monsoon.<br>
  <br>
  This is an issue of environment, which calls for regional and international
  attention. This also calls for finding the reasons and identification of
  remedies alongwith intensification of technology and logistics for early
  warning systems. The research programme and its implementation shall not be
  useful if taken by Bangladesh alone in isolation. Obviously it needs regional
  as well as international consciousness and cooperation.<br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh with a territory of 7% only of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin
  taking the burden of flow of 92% of flood water flowing through her when it is
  the result of rainfall occurring outside Bangladesh in an area 15 times larger
  than Bangladesh herself. Therefore, nonetheless, Bangladesh needs to take the
  initiative calling for regional and international cooperation to identify the
  problems, remedies and steps to cope up with recurrent disaster of flood or
  draught, which is impossible to avoid occurring so frequently due to change in
  climate patterns occurring globally.<br>
  <br>
  A fair water-sharing programme including installation of early warning system
  on regional and international basis would call for construction of various
  infrastructures including storage facilities and modes of transportation for
  regulating the water flow as well for disaster managements.<br>
  <br>
  Rehabilitation programmes against damaged crops, houses, roads, culverts,
  bridges, buildings and health care programmes to minimize risk of getting
  infected by water born diseases etc. following the flood, would be needing
  funds in higher proportion year after year of occurrences of floods,
  particularly if the interval of occurrences of severe flooding gets reduced at
  the rate being observed now from the above data, and then at that instance, it
  may become a recurrent national burden hampering the pace of development,
  hence it requires urgent calling for the need of early awareness seeking
  regional and international cooperation for combating the ill affects of the
  change of global climate.<br>
