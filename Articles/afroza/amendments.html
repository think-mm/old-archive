  <p>This is a matter of great concern and regret that, without taking the
  demands and opinions of all of the Women's, Social, Political, Professional
  and Human Rights Organizations, into consideration, the Government introduced
  the bill today the 17th March, 2004 in the Parliament to move into motion
  under the 14th Amendment Bill, introducing 45 reserved seats for Women in the
  parliament, to be effective for a period of 10 years from the date of adoption
  of the bill in the parliament as an amendment to the legislation for adoption.
  The Speaker however, as normal practice have sent the bill for examination to
  the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Law and Parliamentary affairs, as
  usual but it is however been apprehended since the ruling Government Alliance
  holds more than two-third seats in the Parliament, the bill may very likely
  get adopted as legislation to be effective as a matter of routine within a
  very few days without facing any substantial debate and discussion, in the
  Parliament.</p>
  <p>This may be recalled, on 8th March, 2004 on the eve of the International
  Women's day, the Four party Alliance Government of Bangladesh, adopted a
  resolution in the cabinet of the ministers to agree in principle, to move a
  bill in the current session of the Parliament, bringing 14th amendment of the
  constitution, introducing 45 reserved seats for Women in the parliament, to be
  effective for a period of 10 years from the date of adoption of the bill in
  the parliament as an amendment to the legislation.</p>
  <p>The form and content of the proposal of the amendment met immediately with
  adverse reaction from the Women's Organizations of the country because it was
  totally in contradiction to the concept and perception on which the nation as
  a whole was discussing during the last decade. Statements, rallies,
  demonstrations became a daily affair. Criticism widely mounted in the press
  and public meetings held across the country and those became a growing concern
  of affairs since 8th march, 2004. But, ignoring all those criticisms and
  protests, the Government without taking any heed to those voices to be heard,
  moved ahead with the approval of the draft bill in the cabinet to be moved in
  the Parliament. And then today Government introduced the bill in the
  Parliament as an amendment to the legislation for adoption.</p>
  <p>The situation outside the Parliament however is totally different. The
  movement taking turn to demonstrations of condemnation protests taking the
  shape of token hunger strikes and which may take further stern turns unabated.</p>
  <p>The protests, demands and criticisms on the ground against the proposed
  amendment are directed on three particular aspects. Clarity and unambiguity of
  those justifications firmly demands re- consideration of the amendment by the
  government parties:</p>
  <p>1) Firstly, regarding the proposed number of reserved seats. The government
  did never come up to give any explanation to the citizens of the country, why
  they thought the number 45 to be appropriate. While the relevance of the
  number needed a clarification, the women's organizations political parties,
  social and human rights organizations demanded to make the number looking
  relevant to be proportional to the existing numbers of electoral
  constituencies, or to be proportionate to the administration units. But the
  number chosen by the government appears extremely arbitrary in nature,
  evidently that is the reason why the government could not present any credible
  relevance in choosing this number. Therefore, it is expected that the
  Government must choose a number which embodies a figure proportionate to
  electoral constituency or administrative units of the country, and in line
  with the nationally and internationally accepted proportion of women's
  representation in local government and legislative bodies, which is nearly
  one-third, particularly on the backdrop of the socio-economic perspectives
  where empowerment of women has been identified as an important paradigm and
  effective policy in formulation of policies and strategies for democratic and
  economic development of Bangladesh.</p>
  <p>2) Secondly, it is known by every conscious person with understanding of
  however little sense of parliamentary democracy or democracy at all, that the
  inner meaning of public representation is public accountability. To establish
  public accountability, it is imperative and necessary to define the
  constituent area of the population whom the public representatives are
  representing and unto whom they are accountable. In the proposed amendment no
  such constituency have been defined, on the other hand, it is proposed that
  the number of reserved seats shall be allocated to the political parties
  proportionate to their number strength in the existing parliament of 300
  seats, and then those political parties out of their own choosing shall
  nominate their women members of the parliament to assume the reserved seats
  according to numbers they become entitled to nominate in proportion, so
  determined. This process clearly means that the women members in the reserved
  seats of the parliament will remain accountable to the respective political
  parties in which they belong and not the people. This system totally
  contradicts to the concept of public accountability embedded in the basic
  principles of democratic rights defined in the constitution of the People's
  Republic of Bangladesh, where the inevitability of the public accountability
  of the people's representative is clearly perceived as the fundamental
  principles of the constitution.</p>
  <p>3) Thirdly, the system of nomination kept in the introduced amendment unto
  the existing male dominant parliament with partisan divides can never be
  meaningful at all to serve the cause of empowerment of women mass living
  across the country. The failure of the system of nomination which existed in
  the previous few parliaments have been found through real and practical
  experience for long already to have been ineffective towards the basic cause
  of the empowerment of women; in favour which the nation as a whole has
  reflected unequivocal consensus of public opinion. All the political parties,
  socio-cultural professional and human rights organizations with nobody left
  out including the major ruling parties constituting the present government,
  have voiced their commitment in favour of empowerment of women for the cause
  of socio-political and economic development of the country touching all the
  spheres of the society from rural to urban population. Therefore, to ensure
  the grassroots representation of oppressed women free from elite contacts of
  the government and the political parties, direct election of women's
  representation in the parliament had become the national demand in consensus
  for more than a decade now. Therefore, the demand of direct election advanced
  towards the cause of empowerment of women in the wider perspective needs
  serious consideration by the government.</p>
  <p>Through the united campaign lodged by all of the women's organizations,
  side by side with the opinion voiced by all the political parties, social,
  professional and human rights organizations, it is now more than clear that
  there is absolutely a national consensus for bringing a meaningful amendment
  in the constitution for the cause of empowerment of women: with fully ensuring
  clearly defined adequate number of member for the women's reserved seats in
  the parliament, identifying unambiguously the issue of public accountability
  through establishment of people's constituencies and free from elite contacts
  representing grassroots women hence elected through direct adult franchise.</p>
  <p>BNP, led by Begum Khaleda Zia, in last election manifesto, extended clear
  commitment in favour of 64 reserved seats for women to be elected through
  direct election, and if the government now deviates from the commitment
  already made during the election allowing to doubt that such pledge had been
  made at the time of election to attract women's votes as gimmick only and
  further allowing to let it be termed as a serious breach to the election
  pledge made to the people violating of the principles of public
  accountability; the principles which are an essential component of the country
  constitutionally committed towards democratic development, then it will be
  definitely another disaster to the hopes and aspiration of the people to look
  ahead for a democratically strong Bangladesh, for which the ruling party BNP
  may have to take the blame of the major share of the responsibility, in the
  view of the people.</p>
  <p>Therefore, in conclusion, it is re-iterated if the BNP led government shall
  not now listen to the voices raised on the streets and the press, but go ahead
  adamantly with proposed amendment placed by the Government in the present form
  and contents, then it will not be an overstatement to point out the fact that
  this issue is going to erode the electoral support of BNP very dearly which
  BNP claims to be still holding at needed to stay in power. There is still time
  to give a second thought in the Parliamentary Standing Committee, and it is
  expected that the lawmakers belonging to the ruling parties shall take up this
  issue to introduce necessary reformations giving due respect to the items of
  public consensus particularly touching those in which overwhelm expressions
  are already available on this issue, before placing it to vote for adoption.</p>
