	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although, the advents in mankind of, 
	`God Centric Idealism', `Nature Centric Pragmatism' and `Humanism', have all 
	made great contributions to influence the mindset of the protagonists to 
	undertake reforms or alternative discourses, but never could really free 
	themselves totally from the shackle of status quo with feudalism or other 
	means of exploitation, which captivated Women in the society as commodity of 
	hard labour or commodity of trade for wealth &amp; property, or commodity of 
	sexual abuse. Without undermining the enlightenments and social value of 
	those reforms and discourses, the ontology of the weaknesses impregnated in 
	the inherent contradictions of those Ideals causing failure to overpower 
	feudalism or other means of exploitation, we may still attempt to find 
	within them the right interpretations favouring Women to undertake the 
	social engineering programmes dedicated to the task of the liberation of 
	women from its state of captivation, semi captivation or degraded 
	conditions. But this will definitely lead the society to another form of 
	status quo where Women may find more freedom of opportunity trickled down to 
	them but still remain far away from securing the dignity and rightful 
	partnership in the sphere of the decision or policy making process without 
	having made the appropriate right established irrespective of caste, creed, 
	ethnicity, class and gender in the sphere of economy of the Society and the 
	State, involving appropriate right to access in the process of acquisition 
	of capital, the means of production, marketing and distribution systems in 
	the national, as well into the determination of policy of the state dealing 
	with the formulation of international strategy of economic relations in 
	relation to the modern dimension of globalisation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, the action programme of 
	`Empowerment of Women', in the truthful nature of its commitments, may find 
	its basis in the ideology and partnership that favours the `Empowerment of 
	the Weak', the forces which strive to secure the rightful partnership of all 
	the components of the society in all of the spheres of socio-political and 
	economic policy making process taking place in administrating the affairs of 
	the state, importantly, having made their position clear on the issue of 
	undertaking the task of securing appropriate right established irrespective 
	of caste, creed, ethnicity, class and gender, particularly in the sphere of 
	economy of the society and the state. Because, this is evident from the 
	societies and states where adult franchise i. e. one-person one vote is 
	already recognized, but this right regarding political decision-making has 
	never been found to be able to be meaningfully excercised irrespective of 
	caste, creed, ethnicity, class and gender without having their appropriate 
	rights in the sphere of economy achieved. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have been riddled with arguments 
	and counter arguments on the issue of gender equality. In order to address 
	the issue, first we need to define explicitly, what do we understand by the 
	term of `equality'? Indeed `equality' is a concept founded through 
	representation of imaginary numbers in the school of mathematics. Those 
	imaginary equals are used only to state a particular mode of position, in 
	fact a pre-conceived goal, intending to realize it through implementation of 
	various forces of knowledge. We cannot conceive two different things to be 
	equal unless and until we have set a definite unit of measurement to compare 
	it. Newton said, `All actions have equal and opposite reaction'. There may 
	not be any objection to accept it by its literal meaning, if it is intended 
	to mean that, &quot;All actions `tend' to create an equal and opposite reaction&quot;. 
	Static equilibrium is a concept relative to matters in motion, when `dynamic 
	equilibrium' is the real state of position where forces of action and 
	reaction tending to equalize, sets matter in motion, and continues to be in 
	motion deriving the energy from the process of fusions, thus bringing about 
	the transformations through time and space, the ever-changing universe we 
	are living in. Therefore, the debate of gender equality, although has its 
	premises in the agenda of the empowerment of the weak, but has no premises 
	in the universal meaning of existence since the difference made in the sexes 
	have made them already different and unequal from each other. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religious stasis is a problem and 
	this problem not only being confronted by Women but by the society as a 
	whole, although stasis should not have been the problem inflicting Islam, if 
	Islam would not have been interpreted and mastered by aliens but by the true 
	scholars of Islam and their message would have spread across the Globe and 
	across the Peoples undistorted. I bring this issue here for discussion, 
	because much blame has been unleashed on Islam for bringing about the 
	degraded status of Women prevailing in the present day of Islamic societies, 
	although, much more of degraded position of Women may be as well existing in 
	places where Islam does not prevail but other forms of traditions. In fact 
	Islam is the only religion where the issue of role and status of Women in 
	the society have been addressed to secure at all. All the Semitic religions 
	including Islam are theologically perfect in inducing the ideal of 
	denominating equity of humanity irrespective of caste, creed, ethnicity, 
	class and gender. In Islam the practice followed in the congregation along 
	with its custom and rituals in performing annual Hajj, demonstrates through 
	practice the intention of Islam in considering equality before Allah of all 
	the followers of Islam irrespective of caste, creed, ethnicity, class and 
	gender. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While debating on the issue of 
	gender equality, discussion forums have been found to be gravely inflictive 
	putting Islam as religion in respondent position. I find no reason for doing 
	so. The subject of gender equality may however be discussed in the premises 
	of the various `Islamic Schools of Jurisprudence' which were initially 
	introduced during the 8th century by the `Mujtahid-e-Imams'. The intention 
	of those schools were to formulate and document; law, rules, practice, code 
	of conducts, procedures and guidelines for the various institutions of the 
	machinery of state, the society and the individuals embraced Islam or in 
	future should come to embrace Islam having in them the influences of various 
	backgrounds of socio- cultural and political traditions, and in which the 
	society will also have to contain individuals from other disciplines of 
	faith. Therefore, with unique clarity of vision `Mujtahid-e-Imams' of Islam 
	considered to establish the judiciary to function as the sovereign and 
	independent institution in the state with the dynamics of a definite 
	methodology of working based on the principles of, (a) Exegesis of the 
	`Quo'ran', (b) Exegesis of `Sunnah', (c) Qiyas i.e. analogy, (d) Ijtihad i. 
	e. rational opinion, and (d) Ijma i.e. universal consensus of Ulemas through 
	dialogue. The methodology clearly established a process of dynamic relation 
	among the components for the synthesis of knowledge so considered according 
	to the order of precedence set above for the &quot;School of Jurisprudence&quot; to 
	function. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But, the Muslim rulers due to their 
	ambition to act as the sovereign power of the state shifted their power base 
	to feudalism, and thus usurped the era of political malpractice in the name 
	of Islam. Those forces not only created impediments on the evolutionary 
	process of the Islamic school of Jurisprudence but also distorted the very 
	basis of it to meet their own ends of misappropriation of power and wealth 
	of the state to build their own Empire to lead a coercive life. Eventually, 
	that became the root cause in destruction of the inner cohesion of the 
	societies under the Muslim World as a whole, while on the other hand Islam's 
	real message was to establish and develop a modern society adhering to the 
	principles of social equity and justice, ending the period of pre-Islamic 
	Pagan period of Jehalat. Evidence in this respect is clear from the history 
	that the foremost Mujtahid-e-Imam Abu Hanifa had to die in the dungeon of 
	Khalifa Mansoor when he was forced to take poison for his death. Therefore, 
	the existence of the ` New Jehalat' indeed viewed as tools of oppression 
	unleashed in the name of Islam by the feudal Islamite to continue feudal 
	oppression using the unholy alliance with the dogmatic Islamism propagated 
	in the present day in the so called pseudo Islamic States. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I would like to point out that, in 
	the Holy Quo'ran, references have been made time and again, in the chapters 
	followed by chapters, cautioning mankind from the evils of those brought to 
	human society for not having followed the principles directed by God through 
	His messengers. Exegesis of the Holy Quoran blesses us with the 
	understanding of the divine revelation, for mankind to identify themselves 
	to be though created from the product from nature but uniquely given with 
	the power and insight of the highest level of intelligence, and this 
	position of human being indeed is not a `self- assumed' position but an 
	acquired position attained through exercise of the unique power of the 
	intellectual capabilities and, therefore, in effect, this position of the 
	mankind shall continue to exist until it will be denied by an unequivocal 
	discovery, yet to come. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I find with dismay that, Science has 
	been applied by many to interpret and sometimes to negate the meaning and 
	necessity of the God-centric-idealism and at times, the religion, the belief 
	systems of mankind as a whole. As I see it, the domains of Science and 
	Religion and their premises of working are totally different from each 
	other. In this respect the defensive and at times the pitiful meaningless 
	position taken by the Neu-mod Muslim scholars attempting to interpret Islam 
	as a scientific Religion could not also hold premises because Religion is 
	never Science and Science can never and will never succeed to infringe upon 
	and take the position of metaphysics of Religion founding the basis of 
	ethics and morality of mankind. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I think, we may try to understand 
	that the mankind emphasizes its dual existence, one in the material World 
	through the exercise of the power of Science and the other in the 
	intellectual world curiously intermingled with the belief systems. When 
	Leonardo-da-Vinci made the sketch of the flying machine, he just believed 
	it, but science pursuing the belief brought it into existence in the 
	material world for the benefit of mankind. We may therefore try to realize 
	that, while the Animal Kingdom is victim of nature, the human world 
	qualified, strengthened and driven by the belief systems acquired knowledge 
	from the nature and applied those to upgrade the quality of life dynamically 
	exercising the tools of knowledge acquired through science. Divine 
	injunctions are unequivocal directing mankind to acquire knowledge from the 
	persistent pursuit from within and without one self, to analyze and 
	synthesize those pieces of knowledge to enrich the domain of intelligence 
	incessantly. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The knowledge gathered through study 
	of the animal science may have some useful applications in the field of 
	health and medicine, but application of it in social science involving human 
	beings to depict its nature, cannot give us the real picture to formulate 
	the programmes of the social engineering projects meant towards empowerment 
	of the women, because the science of nature has already given us the 
	knowledge that the laws of nature favours the empowerment of the powerful, 
	the survival of the fittest, and not to the empowerment of the weak. Through 
	the ages of intellectual practices endeavouring unique characteristics 
	derived from the belief systems of religion, doctrines of love and beauty of 
	humanism, through the collective concepts comprising the intellectual 
	properties, mankind arrived in to a position taking the role of the 
	empowerment of the weak, to construct a harmonious and just society living 
	with equity, justice and peace. Hence, in this process of evolution, the 
	ideologies those conceived equity of distribution of power and wealth 
	irrespective of caste, creed, race, class, faith or gender, became the 
	appropriate tools to identify the paradigms of the social engineering 
	projects comprising the empowerment of the weak, in the task of formulating 
	the policy options and strategy for socio- economic development. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Coming back to the agenda, adult 
	franchise in electing people's representatives through votes has been 
	recognized in our society. This right regarding political decision-making is 
	never meaningful or real without appropriate rights in the sphere of 
	economy. If appropriate rights and opportunities are absent regarding 
	resource, employment, education, health, shelter etc., an imbalance in the 
	society is created which puts some curb on the exercise of political rights 
	of the people. If minimum education for all which makes a person conscious 
	about society and economy, and if the weaker forces which comprises vast 
	majority in the World population are not recognized as the important agents 
	in the development programmes by making them able partners in all productive 
	enterprises, organizations, decision and policy making spheres, then the 
	very idea of improving quality of the social life of mankind gets 
	frustrated. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Society, which is controlled and 
	dominated by patriarchal values, recognizing the legitimacy of male 
	domination over social resources, means of production, land and labour etc., 
	turns gender relation into a scenario of domination and sub-ordination, 
	authority and dependence. Such relation determined on the basis of 
	unfounded, false, artificial values, make women suffer from deprivation, 
	oppression, and exploitation. The society which carries the burden of the 
	deprived, oppressed and exploited mass of in-ordinate proportion, fails to 
	bring about an effective combination of land, water, natural and human 
	resources to establish necessary pre-condition for socio- economic 
	development. That is why, in spite of having huge natural resources, 
	countries in Middle-east, Africa, and some other have not been able to 
	ensure any commendable development, on the other hand, having the least per 
	capita land and natural resources, countries like Holland, Japan, China and 
	South Korea undertaking the strategy of combining the available resources 
	and effectively engaging the over all population, could ensure development.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The objective of empowering women in 
	society is to create consciousness about women's problems related to 
	education, health, employment, legal and environmental issues, so that women 
	can improve their position to secure the respect and recognition of the 
	individual personhood and be able to make positive contribution through 
	active participation in the social transformation and decision-making 
	activity. Since, politics and state policies are closely inter-related, 
	women's participation in politics is crucial. The marginal position of 
	women's participation in politics is an over- all indicator of the over-all 
	sub-ordinated position of women in the World. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In context of formulating the 
	development strategy of Bangladesh, sub- ordination of women accepted in all 
	spheres of society, environment of lack of bold and positive attitude to 
	women's problems have been identified as impediments towards potential 
	opportunities for women to get involved in politics, and possibilities for 
	them to ameliorate their position to influence the decision making position 
	in formulating state policies. Therefore, side by side with other policy 
	options considered to formulate the paradigms of strategy for development, 
	the empowerment of women in particular has been identified as one of the 
	several course of programme of action. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It should be mentioned in this 
	regard that, the constitution of Bangladesh in Article 10, embodies the 
	participation of women in all spheres of national life, and in Article 28(2) 
	recognizes equal right for men and women in all spheres of public and state 
	life. The constitution thus implied the possibility of progress through 
	affirmative action by the state in favour of integrating women in the 
	mainstream of development rather than creating a separate channel for them. 
	But, the process of mainstreaming women requires a strong commitment of 
	gender equity supported by careful operational plans to ensure women's 
	participation in all sectors, and reforms of the laws which infringe women's 
	rights to provide the necessary framework of formal equality within which 
	this process can occur. The emphasis on law as a tool for empowerment of 
	women is made in full realization that law reform cannot in itself solve 
	problems of inequality and discrimination, but still the recommendation and 
	demand in this respect for legislative and law reforms are made in 
	recognition that the law as an institution can critically intervene in 
	sectors such as education, employment, health, and most importantly, 
	personal life. Legislation should be passed to at least ensure formal 
	equality in all these spheres, underpinned by procedural reforms 
	particularly aimed at the administrative and enforcement levels to ensure 
	access to justice and the translation of formal to real equality. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The legislative guarantees provided 
	in the constitution of Bangladesh providing equal rights and 
	nondiscrimination of women are further supported by the ratification of the 
	United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination 
	against Women (UNCEDAW). However, a close analysis of the text of the 
	Constitution of Bangladesh and many democratic countries enacting adult 
	franchise reveals a significant omission: the guarantee of equal rights 
	between men and women does not extend to the private sphere, i.e. to matters 
	concerning the family or inheritance to property. The failure to underwrite 
	paper promises of equality is further revealed by the ratification UNCEDAW 
	made by the Government of Bangladesh having been made subject to 
	reservations regarding the Convention provisions dealing with equal rights, 
	particularly within the family, hence such ratification made with 
	reservations would make those Governments liable, within a specified period, 
	to amend its laws in conformity with the Convention. This sharp disjuncture 
	made between paper promises of equality and the reality of legally justified 
	discrimination on the ground of sex is contradiction to the commitment of 
	democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Women's demand for equality before 
	the law is a demand to be recognized as an individual able to determine her 
	own individual physical existences within society, within the community and 
	within the Family, on the basis of equity and nondiscrimination. Individual 
	rights cannot be subsumed within the rights of any group and community. 
	Stasis religious schools of law which could not see the lights of reforms 
	when reforms were sought to happen within them through the methodology 
	established by themselves within those schools of jurisprudences but 
	perpetuating now the discrimination between sexes continued to be justified 
	on the grounds that they are an essential component of a community's self 
	identity, and any encroachment on these laws is an attack on the community 
	or religion, cannot be sustained within a society traditionally committed to 
	reasonable and rational exercise of religious values and politically 
	committed through decades of the people's movements and sacrifice of 
	countless martyrs, to undertake democratic process and protection of right 
	of individual's own religious faith. It is, therefore, intended that, 
	women's rights receive prior protection over undefined &quot;community' rights 
	perpetuating imbalance of power between sexes in the private and family 
	life. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the backdrop of all those social, 
	ideological, political, economical and legal issues, the relevance of 
	undertaking intervention strategy through legislative action to provide 
	reserved seat in the political representative offices on the basis of 
	universal franchise and direct election got its ground in Bangladesh. The 
	socio-economic and political realities dictates the need for special 
	representation of women, but it is necessary to ground such representation 
	on direct contact with grassroots, not on elite contact with party and 
	government. It is therefore necessary to bring about a constitutional 
	amendment of article 65(3) of Bangladesh specifying the number of reserved 
	seats for women and modality of direct election. The area of constituencies 
	under previous provision of 30 nominated reserved seats are too large to 
	serve as direct territorial constituencies, therefore, the number of 
	reserved seats need to be essentially increased from 30 to 64 to correspond 
	with the existing administrative districts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Keeping it in mind that, empowerment 
	of women through legislative action in Bangladesh or a country facing 
	similar situations is not a goal in itself, but is an instrument to set in 
	motion necessary reforms and discourses for a balanced and harmonious 
	process of participation of women in the affairs of the state indeed to 
	bring about the much needed socio-economic and democratic development of the 
	society, and once the balance in the society is achieved liberating women 
	from the abuses of discriminated gender relation and integrating women in to 
	their rightful position within the mainstream of all the activities of the 
	family, society and the state, the necessity of maintaining reserved seats 
	in the political representative offices and the public service sectors 
	should undergo natural process of elimination.</font></p>
