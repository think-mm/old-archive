	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As women comprises about 50% 
	population of Bangladesh, for economic development of the country as a 
	whole, the role of women and their participation in the process of 
	socio-political and economic uplift is imperative. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Bangladesh is carrying the legacy of 
	the backwardness of the women as a suppressed and exploited class which is 
	found to happen during the centuries down in the history due to the 
	evolution of vested interested of a male dominant society although long back 
	in history of Bengal, women had dominant as well as equal social status in 
	the beginning of the agrarian society. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, given the situation of the 
	present, there are several socio- political issues, which need to be 
	addressed step by step to empower the women in Bangladesh to enhance their 
	participation in the socio- political and economic activity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although the constitution of 
	Bangladesh has envisaged equal right of women side by side with men, but the 
	real environment is not up to that which gives women to be able to exercise 
	equal right against men in the present socio-economic conditions. The worse 
	example is that, in some Unions in the country side, due to serious inflict 
	of stigma, even during even the national elections the women are not allowed 
	to visit the polling centers and caste their vote through secret ballot to 
	their chosen candidate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First of all if we look into the 
	statistics, we would find that comparatively the participation of the girl 
	children attending schools to undertake formal education is very poor. The 
	consciousness in the society in this respect is inflicted with several 
	stigmas. Except in a very small section of the society in the urban area, 
	the vast majority of the urban poor and generally in the rural area, a girl 
	child is severely neglected in the family as far as the question of formal 
	education being required as the fundamental right of a citizen as has been 
	inspired in the constitution of Bangladesh, because it is generally 
	considered by the male head of the family that education was not much 
	necessary for the girl child, because, eventually the girl will be confined 
	indoor and essentially be engaged in household work, and only further to the 
	extent of putting her labour in the domestic processing of the agricultural 
	yields on which the vast section the Bangladeshi population is depending 
	economically. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, severe poverty and 
	unemployment has driven quite a considerable section of the rural women in 
	the unskilled and semi- skilled labour market of Bangladesh, as construction 
	labourers, factory or household workers, and lack of education has deprived 
	them even the opportunity to enter into the skilled or of even better fields 
	in the limited labour market of Bangladesh. But, women in the labour market 
	also are facing severe discrimination and exploitation in terms of unequal 
	treatment in considering the wages while compared with her male co-worker.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This situation of discrimination, 
	exploitation and suppression of women as a class cannot be changed up to the 
	spirit of the constitution of Bangladesh, which is the achievement of 
	sacrifice of women too in the war of independence, unless there is an 
	integrated program of the Political Parties, the Government and the NGO's, 
	taken emphatically for the empowerment of the women politically, socially 
	and economically. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The social impediments rest in the 
	low level of consciousness of the vast majority. In this respect the role of 
	the Political Parties and the NGO's are important. Although the role of the 
	NGO's engaged in awareness and micro-credit programs involving the rural 
	women had shown some positive results, but the role of the political parties 
	in creating congenial environment for the smooth functioning and advancement 
	of the NGO's in this respect was never adequate, and in some instances had 
	even been in the negative. The NGO's have been reported to be facing 
	hindrances in some areas of the country where misinterpreted religious 
	sanctions propagated by a bunch of half- educated Mullahs have largely 
	affected the propagation of the awareness programs for the women folk 
	undertook by them. In this conflict, the role of the grass root leaders of 
	the democratic progressive political parties have been found in many 
	occasions to be shy and even the members of the major political parties like 
	AL or BNP in the grass root level particularly BNP being leaned towards 
	attracting support of the so-called dubious religious political forces for 
	the vote also took timid or dubious role. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Although, both AL and BNP have 
	written program for action in their own manifesto, the commitment for the 
	support and implementation of the awareness programs for the empowerment 
	women in the society in all respects but their grass root leaders never had 
	been found to be interested to support and undertake such campaign, 
	understandably for the reason of petty patriarchal interest of male 
	hegemony. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In this respect, an example may be 
	cited that, although the present BNP led Government directed a program of 
	&quot;Food for Education&quot; for the girl children but those allocated food never 
	achieved its desired objective, because the persons mainly male who were 
	responsible to implement the program rarely acted sincerely and honestly.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, in this context the 
	agenda of giving women the reserved and protected number of positions in the 
	Parliament, the central Government, the local Government and in the 
	Government services (specially by increased quota in the education, health &amp; 
	family planning, social welfare and judiciary) through legislative action 
	has its relevance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The women in Bangladesh had been 
	looking forward that a comprehensive bill shall be moved in the coming 
	winter session of the Parliament, to bring about the necessary legislation 
	to help undertake the political steps for the empowerment of women so that 
	we can witness the improvement in participation of women in the 
	socio-political and economic activity. Specially, the Four Party alliance 
	commanding the required two-third majority required to bring about the 
	expected legislations had now this opportunity to prove their sincerity 
	towards their election manifesto consisting their commitments to undertake 
	necessary legislative action for the political empowerment of women in 
	Bangladesh. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But, unfortunately it is reported 
	that, in a meeting held on 14th January, 2004, the leaders of Four Party 
	Alliance chaired by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, agreed to start the process 
	to put forward a bill in the coming winter session of the Parliament 
	expected to be commencing from 18th January, 2004, introducing 50 reserved 
	seats only for women in the Parliament. It was further agreed that, only the 
	Political Parties who have now secured the elected seats in the Parliament 
	and in the numbers proportionate to their existing original numbers should 
	nominate the reserved seats for women. They also agreed that, this amendment 
	of the constitution should be made effective from the same session. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The reaction outside the Four Party 
	Alliance was mixed and faced severe criticism in a few particular aspects, 
	because the Women Organizations for long were demanding for at least 100 
	reserved seats in the Parliament to be secured through direct election.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It obviously caused discontent among 
	the Women Organizations, because they were not discussed by the ruling 
	Alliance before taking of this particular decision on this matter. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The leader of the Coalition of 
	Woman's' Organizations, Mrs. Ayesha Khanam giving her response informed 
	that, last year in a meeting of the Coalition of The Woman's' Organizations 
	with the Law Minister, Barrister Moudud Ahmed, happened to have expressed at 
	that time to agree with the demand for introducing 100 reserved seats for 
	women in the Parliament through direct election, but now the decision taken 
	by the Four Party Alliance, is disappointing. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Barrister Tania Amir commented that, 
	the days for women securing ornamental nominated reserved seats in the 
	Parliament should end. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is strongly felt that, by keeping 
	the system of nomination rather than direct election the expectation of the 
	women to attain their just, proper, dignified, unbiased, independent and 
	unfettered representation will not be ensured, rather the women 
	representative becoming nomination seekers have still to depend greatly on 
	the existing Political Parties and in such a situation obviously as it had 
	been found from experience in the previous occasions that the activity of 
	those nominated MPs mostly became influenced and guided by the partisan 
	agenda of the existing political parties and for whom the agenda for 
	Empowerment of Women had always been a secondary issue. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Unity of the Women Organizations 
	clearly explained during a meeting held today, 15th January, 2004 at the 
	central Sahid Minar that, the above reason for demanding direct election and 
	for at least 64 reserved seats distributed in the manner to be each one from 
	an area of the existing Police Station, and demanded with this view to 
	strongly consider the issue. The Four Party Alliance under the leadership of 
	Begum Khaleda Zia being a woman herself called upon once again to take steps 
	accordingly without shifting her own position committed during her election 
	campaign in 2001. The demonstration and rally of the women pressed their 
	demand to the Government particularly to the Prime Minister to show Begum 
	Khaleda Zia now her sincere intention to keep her commitment and undertake 
	to move the appropriate legislative amendment to open up the real 
	opportunity to get the true representatives of women seeking empowerment 
	getting directly elected as MP with dignity for a change. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Adding much to the disappointment 
	that the legislation for introducing and enhancing the number women as and 
	where applicable through directly elected reserved seats at the local 
	Government level and the other issue for enhancing the reserved quota for 
	employment in the public services, were not discussed at all, at this point 
	of time.</font></p>
