  coffee to cheques and the three-course meal, the Muslim world has given us

  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">1</span> The story goes that an Arab 
  named Khalid was tending his goats in the Kaffa region of southern Ethiopia, 
  when he noticed his animals became livelier after eating a certain berry. He 
  boiled the berries to make the first coffee. Certainly the first record of the 
  drink is of beans exported from Ethiopia to Yemen where Sufis drank it to stay 
  awake all night to pray on special occasions. By the late 15th century it had 
  arrived in Mecca and Turkey from where it made its way to Venice in 1645. It 
  was brought to England in 1650 by a Turk named Pasqua Rosee who opened the 
  first coffee house in Lombard Street in the City of London. The Arabic qahwa 
  became the Turkish kahve then the Italian caffé and then English coffee.

  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">2</span> The ancient Greeks thought 
  our eyes emitted rays, like a laser, which enabled us to see. The first person 
  to realise that light enters the eye, rather than leaving it, was the 
  10th-century Muslim mathematician, astronomer and physicist Ibn al-Haitham. He 
  invented the first pin-hole camera after noticing the way light came through a 
  hole in window shutters. The smaller the hole, the better the picture, he 
  worked out, and set up the first Camera Obscura (from the Arab word qamara for 
  a dark or private room). He is also credited with being the first man to shift 
  physics from a philosophical activity to an experimental one. </font></p>

  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">3</span> A form of chess was played in 
  ancient India but the game was developed into the form we know it today in 
  Persia. From there it spread westward to Europe - where it was introduced by 
  the Moors in Spain in the 10th century - and eastward as far as Japan. The 
  word rook comes from the Persian rukh, which means chariot.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">4</span> A thousand years before the 
  Wright brothers a Muslim poet, astronomer, musician and engineer named Abbas 
  ibn Firnas made several attempts to construct a flying machine. In 852 he 
  jumped from the minaret of the Grand Mosque in Cordoba using a loose cloak 
  stiffened with wooden struts. He hoped to glide like a bird. He didn't. But 
  the cloak slowed his fall, creating what is thought to be the first parachute, 
  and leaving him with only minor injuries. In 875, aged 70, having perfected a 
  machine of silk and eagles' feathers he tried again, jumping from a mountain. 
  He flew to a significant height and stayed aloft for ten minutes but crashed 
  on landing - concluding, correctly, that it was because he had not given his 
  device a tail so it would stall on landing. Baghdad international airport and 
  a crater on the Moon are named after him.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">5</span> Washing and bathing are 
  religious requirements for Muslims, which is perhaps why they perfected the 
  recipe for soap which we still use today. The ancient Egyptians had soap of a 
  kind, as did the Romans who used it more as a pomade. But it was the Arabs who 
  combined vegetable oils with sodium hydroxide and aromatics such as thyme oil. 
  One of the Crusaders' most striking characteristics, to Arab nostrils, was 
  that they did not wash. Shampoo was introduced to England by a Muslim who 
  opened Mahomed's Indian Vapour Baths on Brighton seafront in 1759 and was 
  appointed Shampooing Surgeon to Kings George IV and William IV. </font></p>

  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">6</span> Distillation, the means of 
  separating liquids through differences in their boiling points, was invented 
  around the year 800 by Islam's foremost scientist, Jabir ibn Hayyan, who 
  transformed alchemy into chemistry, inventing many of the basic processes and 
  apparatus still in use today - liquefaction, crystallisation, distillation, 
  purification, oxidisation, evaporation and filtration. As well as discovering 
  sulphuric and nitric acid, he invented the alembic still, giving the world 
  intense rosewater and other perfumes and alcoholic spirits (although drinking 
  them is haram, or forbidden, in Islam). Ibn Hayyan emphasised systematic 
  experimentation and was the founder of modern chemistry. </font></p>

  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">7</span> The crank-shaft is a device 
  which translates rotary into linear motion and is central to much of the 
  machinery in the modern world, not least the internal combustion engine. One 
  of the most important mechanical inventions in the history of humankind, it 
  was created by an ingenious Muslim engineer called al-Jazari to raise water 
  for irrigation. His 1206 Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices 
  shows he also invented or refined the use of valves and pistons, devised some 
  of the first mechanical clocks driven by water and weights, and was the father 
  of robotics. Among his 50 other inventions was the combination lock. </font>

  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">8</span> Quilting is a method of 
  sewing or tying two layers of cloth with a layer of insulating material in 
  between. It is not clear whether it was invented in the Muslim world or 
  whether it was imported there from India or China. But it certainly came to 
  the West via the Crusaders. They saw it used by Saracen warriors, who wore 
  straw-filled quilted canvas shirts instead of armour. As well as a form of 
  protection, it proved an effective guard against the chafing of the Crusaders' 
  metal armour and was an effective form of insulation - so much so that it 
  became a cottage industry back home in colder climates such as Britain and 
  Holland.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">9</span> The pointed arch so 
  characteristic of Europe 's Gothic cathedrals was an invention borrowed from 
  Islamic architecture. It was much stronger than the rounded arch used by the 
  Romans and Normans , thus allowing the building of bigger, higher, more 
  complex and grander buildings. Other borrowings from Muslim genius included 
  ribbed vaulting, rose windows and dome-building techniques. Europe's castles 
  were also adapted to copy the Islamic world's - with arrow slits, battlements, 
  a barbican and parapets. Square towers and keeps gave way to more easily 
  defended round ones. Henry V's castle architect was a Muslim. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">10</span> Many modern surgical 
  instruments are of exactly the same design as those devised in the 10th 
  century by a Muslim surgeon called al-Zahrawi. His scalpels, bone saws, 
  forceps, fine scissors for eye surgery and many of the 200 instruments he 
  devised are recognisable to a modern surgeon. It was he who discovered that 
  catgut used for internal stitches dissolves away naturally (a discovery he 
  made when his monkey ate his lute strings) and that it can be also used to 
  make medicine capsules. In the 13th century, another Muslim medic named Ibn 
  Nafis described the circulation of the blood, 300 years before William Harvey 
  discovered it. Muslims doctors also invented anaesthetics of opium and alcohol 
  mixes and developed hollow needles to suck cataracts from eyes in a technique 
  still used today. </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">11</span> The windmill was invented in 
  634 for a Persian caliph and was used to grind corn and draw up water for 
  irrigation. In the vast deserts of Arabia, when the seasonal streams ran dry, 
  the only source of power was the wind which blew steadily from one direction 
  for months. Mills had six or 12 sails covered in fabric or palm leaves. It was 
  500 years before the first windmill was seen in Europe.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">12</span> The technique of inoculation 
  was not invented by Jenner and Pasteur but was devised in the Muslim world and 
  brought to Europe from Turkey by the wife of the English ambassador to 
  Istanbul in 1724. Children in Turkey were vaccinated with cowpox to fight the 
  deadly smallpox at least 50 years before the West discovered it. </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">13</span> The fountain pen was 
  invented for the Sultan of Egypt in 953 after he demanded a pen which would 
  not stain his hands or clothes. It held ink in a reservoir and, as with modern 
  pens, fed ink to the nib by a combination of gravity and capillary action.

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">14</span> The system of numbering in 
  use all round the world is probably Indian in origin but the style of the 
  numerals is Arabic and first appears in print in the work of the Muslim 
  mathematicians al-Khwarizmi and al-Kindi around 825. Algebra was named after 
  al-Khwarizmi's book, Al-Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah, much of whose contents are still 
  in use. The work of Muslim maths scholars was imported into Europe 300 years 
  later by the Italian mathematician Fibonacci. Algorithms and much of the 
  theory of trigonometry came from the Muslim world. And Al-Kindi's discovery of 
  frequency analysis rendered all the codes of the ancient world soluble and 
  created the basis of modern cryptology. </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">15</span> Ali ibn Nafi, known by his 
  nickname of Ziryab (Blackbird) came from Iraq to Cordoba in the 9th century 
  and brought with him the concept of the three-course meal - soup, followed by 
  fish or meat, then fruit and nuts. He also introduced crystal glasses (which 
  had been invented after experiments with rock crystal by Abbas ibn Firnas - 
  see No 4). </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">16</span> Carpets were regarded as 
  part of Paradise by medieval Muslims, thanks to their advanced weaving 
  techniques, new tinctures from Islamic chemistry and highly developed sense of 
  pattern and arabesque which were the basis of Islam's non-representational 
  art. In contrast, Europe's floors were distinctly earthly, not to say earthy, 
  until Arabian and Persian carpets were introduced. In England, as Erasmus 
  recorded, floors were &quot;covered in rushes, occasionally renewed, but so 
  imperfectly that the bottom layer is left undisturbed, sometimes for 20 years, 
  harbouring expectoration, vomiting, the leakage of dogs and men, ale 
  droppings, scraps of fish, and other abominations not fit to be mentioned&quot;. 
  Carpets, unsurprisingly, caught on quickly. </font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">17</span> The modern cheque comes from 
  the Arabic saqq, a written vow to pay for goods when they were delivered, to 
  avoid money having to be transported across dangerous terrain. In the 9th 
  century, a Muslim businessman could cash a cheque in China drawn on his bank 
  in Baghdad.</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><font face="Verdana">
  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">18</span> By the 9th century, many 
  Muslim scholars took it for granted that the Earth was a sphere. The proof, 
  said astronomer Ibn Hazm, &quot;is that the Sun is always vertical to a particular 
  spot on Earth&quot;. It was 500 years before that realisation dawned on Galileo. 
  The calculations of Muslim astronomers were so accurate that in the 9th 
  century they reckoned the Earth's circumference to be 40, 253.4km - less than 
  200km out. The scholar al-Idrisi took a globe depicting the world to the court 
  of King Roger of Sicily in 1139.</font></p>

  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">19</span> Though the Chinese invented 
  saltpetre gunpowder, and used it in their fireworks, it was the Arabs who 
  worked out that it could be purified using potassium nitrate for military use. 
  Muslim incendiary devices terrified the Crusaders. By the 15th century they 
  had invented both a rocket, which they called a &quot;self-moving and combusting 
  egg&quot;, and a torpedo - a self-propelled pear-shaped bomb with a spear at the 
  front which impaled itself in enemy ships and then blew up. </font></p>

  <span style="background-color: #C0C0C0">20</span> Medieval Europe had kitchen 
  and herb gardens, but it was the Arabs who developed the idea of the garden as 
  a place of beauty and meditation. The first royal pleasure gardens in Europe 
  were opened in 11th-century Muslim Spain. Flowers which originated in Muslim 
  gardens include the carnation and the tulip.</font></p>
