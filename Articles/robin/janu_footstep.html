  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is a piece by Adib Khan one of the best writers of Bangladesh origin 
  (in my opinion) who writes in English. I was recently had the pleasure of 
  reading his first book &quot;Seasonal Adjustments&quot; on the recommendation of a 
  friend and it was terrific. Adib Khan writes very lucidly and with great 
  sarcastic wit and from which he does not spare any one least of all himself.
  </p>
  <p>It was difficult getting a brand new copy but getting an used copy on-line 
  was very easy and inexpensive at least here in the US. A review of Seasonal 
  Adjustments follows the piece. Those who remember 1971, its idealism and 
  Bangladesh of today seen in the eyes of a Bangladeshi who returns after 18 
  years abroad will find the book irrepressible. Some of you may even recognize 
  some of the characters in the book. I hope all of you will pick up a copy and 
  read. Robin </p>

  <p>---------------</p>
  <p><b>In Janus’ Footsteps By Adib Khan </b></p>
  <p>The philosopher, Diogenes, was known to have an undisguised contempt for 
  any distinction between Greeks and foreigners. When asked what his country 
  was, he replied: ‘I am a citizen of the world’, and in so doing he coined the 
  Greek word cosmopolitan to express his thoughts on the matter. I imagine that 
  more than two thousand years later there are many among us who share that 
  view. </p>
  <p>The question of identity has been a complicated issue for me, long before I 
  accidentally stumbled into writing. I have always been wary of any rigid, 
  stereotyped characteristics that may be attributed to the word identity in a 
  way that may compromise my notions of individualism. Undoubtedly my attitude 
  has much to do with cultural fragmentation. </p>
  <p>There are times when I recall an interesting experience during the early 
  1980s, after I became an Australian citizen. It was the singular incident that 
  set me thinking about the multiple dimensions of identity, especially when you 
  transcend boundaries and leap across cultures. On a tram in Melbourne, an 
  elderly lady, whose grandfather had a stint in India as a British 
  administrator, asked me politely if I was an Indian. </p>
  <p>‘No,’ I replied, ‘although India is my ancestral home. My grandparents and 
  my parents were born there, and I have relatives in Calcutta where I spent 
  most of my school holidays.’ </p>
  <p>Was I a Pakistani? </p>
  <p>‘No,’ I responded, ‘I was born in Pakistan, but my Australian passport 
  doesn’t say so.’ </p>
  <p>‘Ah, an Australian!’ </p>
  <p>The enlightened exclamation sounded very definitive in its conclusion. </p>
  <p>‘So, you were born in Pakistan but now you are an Australian citizen. A 
  Pakistani-born Australian!’ </p>
  <p>Her triumph was short-lived. I wanted to be more precise about the 
  confusion I was creating. </p>
  <p>‘Not quite,’ I said, watching her frown. ‘I was born in Pakistan, but 
  officially I can no longer claim that privilege.’ </p>
  <p>There was a perplexed silence. By this time I was rather pleased with the 
  web of mystery I had spun around my national identity. The riddle had rapidly 
  reached a complexity worthy of the Sphinx. It was time for the grand 
  revelation. </p>
  <p>‘I was born in East Pakistan,’ I explained. ‘It is now Bangladesh.’ </p>
  <p>She nodded and smiled, but I sensed that the bewilderment was still there. 
  But I had stated the truth. It really summed me up. I was born in Pakistan, 
  with familial connections in India, had a rebirth in Bangladesh without ever 
  believing in reincarnation, and now I was an Australian in possession of a 
  certificate and an associated document of sixty-four pages, valid for ten 
  years, to prove who I was. If one considers Hamlet’s situation as a parallel, 
  then his dilemma was relatively simple. He was merely crawling between earth 
  and heaven - an uncharted distance, I shall grant him that. But one may well 
  ask, what should such fellows as I do with the claims of four different 
  countries tugging at me for some declaration of who I am? </p>
  <p>At any point in our lives, we can think of ourselves as relating to a 
  number of identities - in terms of gender, age, family status and ethnicity, 
  to name only a few. The conceptual and emotional difficulties that a migrant 
  experiences in coming to a singular understanding of the term identity is akin 
  to standing in the middle of a chamber of mirrors that are in constant, slow 
  rotation. One catches glimpses of transient reflections without ever settling 
  on a fixed image. Those of us who have reluctantly experienced displacement, 
  or willingly shifted our cultural base, find our own private ways of locating 
  and perceiving ourselves beyond the obvious coordinates of a street, a suburb, 
  a town or a passport. I am no exception in this quiet search, and my vehicle 
  of travel is writing fiction. </p>
  <p>But undeniably, as a social being, I am part of a larger scene, and I have 
  to say that looking at the bigger picture makes me uneasy about contemporary 
  communal attitudes regarding identity. The cultural fragmentation with which I 
  must cope merely complicates the issue, but it also alerts me to the pitfalls 
  of excessive and sometimes blind patriotism that is often evident, for 
  example, in such comparatively trivial matters as sports. </p>
  <p>The alarming acceleration in technological evolution and its impact on 
  social and cultural changes has impacted significantly on the ways communities 
  are insisting on defining themselves. It would seem that there is a desperate 
  need to find historical and contemporary markers to construct a framework 
  within which people can feel secure about their perceived values and 
  lifestyles. Across nations there appears to be shift in the way people 
  characterise identity. The identity of the individual is now sometimes 
  subservient to a community’s ideology of what a person should be if he or she 
  is to have a meaningful place in mainstream society. </p>
  <p>Discourse on gender, ethnic and class identity appears to have subsided for 
  the moment and we are caught in a mesh of aggressive nationalism that 
  encourages a somewhat naïve and illusory view of a heroic identity. Guilt and 
  alienation are frequently evoked to lash individuals into an acceptance of an 
  advanced tribal mentality, and these are often achieved by clearly defined 
  characteristics of unacceptable non-conformity. Probably this is a communal 
  reaction to fear, a backlash against globalisation that is perceived to be 
  threat to national identity. </p>
  <p>I am rather uneasy by the resurgence of a myopic nationalism that can 
  escalate into something more than just a chest-beating exercise about a 
  community’s superior virtues. There is a strong and potentially dangerous 
  martial component in such pride. In a recent article in the Australian (April 
  27, 2001), Helen Irving has suggested that blockquote </p>
  <p>The attempt to make the Anzacs stand for all Australians is part of a 
  disturbing cultural process - seeking moral certainties in our lives and our 
  history, and finding them in the imaginary homogeneity of the past. blockquote
  </p>
  <p>Indeed, there is a trend to pinpoint what is considered to be ‘unAustralian’. 
  Complementing Irving’s viewpoint, Rosemary Neill, in the same newspaper on the 
  same day, posited that ‘unAustralian’ was a word ‘whose increasing use and 
  abuse is suggestive of a new jingoism on the loose.’ Thankfully, there is also 
  a growing awareness that a society as diverse as Australia cannot be simply 
  characterised by a set of traits to define us all for the sake of so-called 
  social cohesiveness. As Irving points out, ‘There is no single identity for 
  Australians.’ </p>
  <p>I do not believe that it is possible for me to wear the permanent tag of a 
  cultural stereotype. An unqualified identification with a single, mainstream 
  tradition would be a denial of the composite that I am. It would be futile 
  and, indeed, undesirable to attempt to purge the cultural diversity that has 
  shaped me. My splintered life is not entirely the result of migration. It was 
  a natural consequence of an upbringing that was strongly influenced by 
  history. In the 1950s and ’60s, the postcolonial subcontinent was still 
  strongly affected by the cultural and institutional legacy we had inherited 
  from the British. For my parents it was inconceivable that I would not attend 
  a school where English was not the language of instruction. I was sent to a 
  Catholic school run by Jesuits. The fragmentation took place early in my life.
  </p>
  <p>There were parts of the New Testament to be studied at school in a subject 
  that was absurdly titled Moral Science. We were strictly warned not to wander 
  into the Old Testament. Some friends and I deduced that since anything 
  forbidden had to do with girls and sex, the Old Testament had to be compulsory 
  reading. So I read Genesis and Exodus and learned about creation and Moses, 
  played cricket in the afternoon and returned home to face a Spartan mullah 
  waiting to hear my reading of the Koran and teach me about the only faith he 
  wanted me to know. In retrospect, the exposure to the historical richness of 
  Christianity and Islam saved me from some of the prejudices of ignorance and 
  set me on the path to cultural dualism where it was no longer possible to 
  think about myself in terms of a single tradition. This dualistic cultural 
  pattern was integrated into my life, as I grew older and matured. </p>
  <p>On the one side there were Homer, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare and Milton. On 
  the other there were the influences of The Ramayana, Mahabharata, the Moghul 
  poets, Iqbal and Tagore. The two sides met, not in combat, but in a synthesis 
  of ideas out of which I emerged considerably enriched in thought and feeling 
  but without any clearly defined sense of belonging to a monocultural society. 
  I would not have it any other way. Even at the risk of sounding excessively 
  egotistical, the awareness of my multiplicity makes me curious about myself. 
  What I was, what I am and what I will be are subjective speculations with no 
  definitive answers. </p>
  <p>My writing life has merely intensified my curiosity about identity. Writing 
  fiction was purely accidental during a period of soul searching to know why I 
  was so restless when I turned forty. There was a growing dissatisfaction with 
  my professional life as a teacher and boredom with the predictability of my 
  middle-class existence in a Victorian country town. I had reached that point 
  of lethargic blandness where any desire for intellectual fulfilment was being 
  blunted by an increasing indifference about the wider world. Underneath all of 
  this was a kind of insurgency, a revolution from within that insisted I pay 
  attention to myself. Well I made an effort to meet the real me by recording my 
  reflections in fragmented bits of writing. </p>
  <p>A novel emerged as a residue of this attempt at self-analysis, and with it 
  came the realisation that I was destined to occupy a kind of no-man’s-land, 
  wedged between polarised cultures. My identity is simultaneously plural and 
  mutable. There is no definitive measurement of who I am. My occupancy of a 
  territory between the east and the west does not offer much stability. Here 
  the earth often shakes quite violently to discourage me from developing any 
  sense of permanence or belonging. </p>
  <p>However uncomfortable this position may be, it is by no means an arid 
  ground for the mind to discover a multiplicity of voices and what they have to 
  say. The migrant’s voice tells me what it is like to feel a stranger and yet 
  be at home, to live both inside and outside of one’s immediate situation, to 
  be permanently on the move, to think of one way return journeys but to realise 
  at the same time the impossibility of doing so, since the past is not only 
  another country but also another time, beyond the grasp of the present. It 
  tells me about long-distance journeys and relocations, of losses, changes, 
  conflicts, powerlessness and visions of what might have been. </p>
  <p>And with it comes infinite sadness that severely tests my emotional 
  resolve. But there is another voice, different in tone and articulating 
  entirely different perspectives of another landscape. It speaks about new 
  experiences, of ideas that extend my intellectual and emotional frontiers and 
  recharges the desire to explore unknown territories. It encourages me to 
  celebrate the richness of cultural diversity. In a sense, writing is has 
  become a residence, a place I can call home. </p>
  <p>So the question arises, in this house of writing which room do I occupy and 
  can I be even vaguely characterised by the way I live? </p>
  <p>Well, perhaps that was a possibility until very recently. At the moment, I 
  am in a state of transition, shifting from one room to another, planning a 
  novel set entirely in Australia, not about migrants, but about a white 
  Australian, a Vietnam Veteran, troubled by guilt and concerned by his lack of 
  responsibility during the war, seeking atonement through art and a commitment 
  to a relationship with a partially paralysed woman. And how am I responding to 
  this slightly alien scenario that I have built into the writing landscape? 
  Well, I am still in the same house, merely changing rooms. That sense of 
  familiarity has not deserted me. And I figure that if a Japanese could have 
  written a novel about an English butler, then a Bangladeshi can fictionalise a 
  white Australian’s experience. I don’t have a problem with pulling down 
  artificial barriers. That is one of the supreme advantages of not being 
  weighed down by a single identity. </p>
  <p>Book Name: Seasonal Adjustments Author: Adib Khan Publisher: Allen &amp; Unwin 
  Year: 1994 Pages: 297 Price: $11.95 </p>
  <p>Seasonal Adjustments was the 1994 winner of Australia's NSW Literary Award. 
  Adib Khan, a teacher of English and History at Ballarat, Victoria, migrated to 
  Australia from Bangla Desh in 1973. This first novel is a bittersweet tale 
  about the dislocation and cultural fragmentation of the immigrant from the 
  sub-continent. </p>
  <p>Like his creator, Iqbal Chaudhari, the hero of Seasonal Adjustments, left 
  Bangla Desh for Australia soon after the war with Pakistan. Now, eighteen 
  years later, he has returned to his native land, accompanied by his daughter. 
  He is separated from his Australian wife, who needs time to reflect on their 
  relationship. </p>
  <p>The novel is set in Dhaka and Shopnoganj, Iqbal's ancestral village; but 
  the past whether in Australia, or Dhaka, or Shopnoganj keeps bubbling up. The 
  racism in Australia is humiliating, and the Catholicism of his in-laws leaves 
  him cold, but he is equally ambivalent about Islam. The decisions involved in 
  raising a child of mixed race and the conflict between the two cultures 
  complicate his life. He finds the affluent life of his zamindar family and 
  their friends, corrupt and hypocritical. Behind the faÃ§ade of propriety, 
  Iqbal learns that his physician brother in Dhaka is planning to divorce his 
  wife to marry his mistress. His younger sister confesses that she is a lesbian 
  who considers it best that people don't know this about her. </p>
  <p>His once idealistic journalist friends Iftiqar and Zafar are now embittered 
  and kept under army surveillance. They work under a dangling noose to remind 
  themselves of the murder of their fellow journalist and friend, who had been 
  hanged by the army because he was a Hindu and a communist. Iftiqar himself 
  suffers from post-traumatic stress resulting from his days with the Mukti 
  Bahini. When the ancestral lands are sold to pay off debts and the village of 
  Shopnoganj is to be the site of a refinery, Iqbal realizes that the world of 
  his boyhood is forever altered. </p>
  <p>The contrast between the suburban boredom of Ballarat and the chaos and 
  vitality of Dhaka are wonderfully captured in a scene describing bus travel 
  outside Dhaka, in which a passenger insists that his goat is luggage! &quot;It 
  cannot come inside my bus!&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;It is my luggage!&quot; The farmer insisted. &quot;I do not have a trunk or a 
  suitcase!&quot; He glowered and made another lunge with the umbrella. </p>
  <p>The goat was a sacrosanct barrier. Neither antagonist crossed the divide 
  the animal represented. </p>
  <p>&quot;Luggage?&quot; The conductor screeched beseechingly to the growing crowd. &quot;Eish! 
  This is too much!&quot; He shook in emphatic disbelief before leaping evasively to 
  the left. &quot;How can I admit a dirty animal into the bus as a piece of luggage? 
  I have to think of my passengers!&quot; </p>
  <p>A matter of pressing urgency forced the wretched animal to break the 
  deadlock and humiliate the owner. As if to justify the conductor's stalagmitic 
  stand, the goat surrendered to a bout of enuresis. A trickle of pale yellow 
  liquid splattered the footpath. The onlookers reacted with consternation. The 
  circle widened quickly. People clapped. They whistled and exhorted the goat to 
  greater effort... </p>
  <p>&quot;You see what I mean?&quot; The conductor appealed to a wall of grinning faces. 
  Na! Just think how smelly it would be inside the bus. Eish!&quot; For emphasis he 
  tilted his head upwards and pinched his nostrils with his thumb and index 
  fingers. With the other hand he fanned the air near his face. </p>
  <p>The writing is flawless, switching from a humorously ironic tone to one of 
  lyricism and tenderness. At the end of the novel when Iqbal decides to return 
  to Australia, despite his marginalized existence there, he concludes that for 
  the immigrant there are no easy answers. </p>
  <p>&quot;I shall pine over what might have been. This is the way it must be. I have 
  known too much to live contentedly.&quot; </p>
  <p>This engrossing novel should be popular with all immigrants. </p>
