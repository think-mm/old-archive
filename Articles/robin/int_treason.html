	extraordinary coalition that is undermining science...</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The second-term election victory of 
	George Bush - and India's own experience with Hindu nationalist BJP rule, 
	off and on, through the last decade - captures a dangerous moment in world 
	history. We are witnessing the world's first and the world's largest liberal 
	constitutional democracies, officially committed to secularism, slide toward 
	religious nationalism. By voting out the BJP and its allies in the last 
	election, the Indian voters have halted this slide, at least for now - a 
	heartening development, compared to the virtual take-over of America by 
	Christian evangelicals and fundamentalists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The question that interests me in 
	this electoral route to faith–based governance is how this 
	counter–revolution is actually accomplished, or to put it differently, how 
	the spirit of secularism gets subverted, without any formal abrogation of 
	secular laws. Unless we understand the ideological mechanism of this 
	sacralisation of politics, we will not be able to combat the ongoing coups 
	against secularism under nominally secular democracies. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As a student of the history and 
	philosophy of science, I have been watching with concern how modern science 
	itself — perhaps the single most powerful force for secularisation — is 
	being re–coded as sacred, either as affirming the Bible or the Vedas, or as 
	‘lower knowledge’ of ‘dead matter’, in need of spiritualisation. As an 
	old–time partisan of the Enlightenment and scientific temper, I have been 
	watching with concern as my fellow intellectuals and activists, in the 
	United States and India, who identify themselves with social justice, 
	anti–imperialism, women’s rights and sustainable development, have 
	themselves paved the way for re–enchantment or re–sacralisation of science.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many of the Hindutva arguments for 
	‘Vedic science’ find a resonance with the fashionable theories of 
	alternative sciences and postcolonial studies. Indeed, it is difficult to 
	avoid the impression that postmodernist and multiculturalist critics of 
	modern science are re–discovering and restating many of the arguments Hindu 
	nationalists have long used to assert the superior scientificity of Hindu 
	sacred traditions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">George Orwell’s doublethink bears an 
	uncanny resemblance to the well–known Hindu tendency to eclectically combine 
	contradictory ideas by declaring them to be simply different paths or names 
	of a shared enterprise, as is the case with the amorphous grab–bag of Hindu 
	myths, mysticism and philosophy, known as ‘the Vedas’. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Recall how double–think worked in 
	1984: Words came to mean their opposites: war meant peace, freedom was 
	slavery, and ignorance strength. History was endlessly revised to make the 
	present look like a confirmation of eternal, unchanging truths. Words, 
	representations, facts ceased to mean what they appeared to be saying. Shorn 
	of any definite and contestable meanings, words began to be used 
	interchangeably, hybridised endlessly, without any fear of contradictions.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Under BJP rule, superstitions 
	started getting described as science. Hindu nationalists started invoking 
	science in just about every speech and policy statement. But while they 
	uttered the word ‘science’ — which in today’s world is understood as modern 
	science — they meant astrology, or vastu, or Vedic creationism, or 
	transcendental meditation or ancient humoral theory of disease taught by 
	Ayuerveda. This was not just talk: state universities and colleges got big 
	grants from the government to offer post–graduate degrees, including PhDs in 
	astrology; research in vastu shastra, meditation, faith–healing, cow–urine 
	and priest–craft was promoted with substantial injections of public money. 
	Nearly every important discovery of modern science was read back into Hindu 
	sacred books: explosion of nuclear energy became the awesome appearance of 
	God in the Bhagvat Gita; the indeterminacy at quantum level served as 
	confirmation of Vedanta; atomic charges became equivalent to negative, 
	positive and neutral gunas, or moral qualities; the reliance of experience 
	and reason in science became the same thing as reliance on mystical 
	experience, and so on. Contemporary theories of physics, evolution and 
	biology were wilfully distorted to make it look as if all of modern science 
	was converging to affirm the New Age, mind–over–matter cosmology that 
	follows from Vedantic monism. ‘Evidence’ from fringe sciences was used to 
	support all kinds of superstitions, from vastu, astrology, ‘quantum healing’ 
	to the latest theory of Vedic creationism. Science and ‘Vedas’ were treated 
	as homologues, as just different names of the same thing. Orwell’s Big 
	Brother would’ve felt right at home! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another sign of doublespeak was 
	this: On the one hand, the BJP and its allies presented themselves as great 
	champions of science, as long as it could be absorbed into ‘the Vedas’, of 
	course. On the other hand, they aggressively condemned the secular and 
	naturalistic worldview of science — the disenchantment of nature — as 
	‘reductionist’, ‘Western’ or even ‘Semitic’ and therefore un–Hindu and 
	un–Indian. Science yes, and technology yes, but a rational–materialist 
	critique of Vedic idealism no — that became the mantra of Hindutva. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Why this over–eagerness to claim the 
	support of science? There is a modernising impulse in all religions to make 
	the supposedly timeless truths of theology acceptable to the modern minds 
	raised on a scientific sensibility. ‘Scientific creationism’ among Christian 
	and Islamic fundamentalists is an example of this impulse. But while 
	Christian fundamentalists in America indulge in creationism primarily to get 
	past the constitutional requirement for a separation of church and state, in 
	India it is motivated by ultra–nationalism, Hindu chauvinism and the 
	nationalist urge to declare Hinduism’s superiority as the religion of reason 
	and natural law over Christianity and Islam, which are declared to be 
	irrational and faith–based creeds. Contemporary Hindu nationalists are 
	carrying on with the neo–Hindu tradition of proclaiming Hinduism as the 
	universal religion of the future because of its superior ‘holistic science’ 
	(as compared to the ‘reductionist science’ of the West.) Besides, it is 
	easier to sell traditions and rituals, especially to urban, upwardly mobile 
	men, if they have the blessings of English–speaking ‘scientific’ gurus.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Granted, this business of Vedic 
	science had been going on before anyone had ever heard the word 
	‘postmodern’. But this Hindu nationalist appropriation of science has found 
	new sources of intellectual respectability from the postmodernist, 
	anti–Enlightenment turn taken by intellectuals, most radically in American 
	universities, but also in India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What do I mean by postmodernism and 
	how did it play out in India? Postmodernism encompasses a wide variety of 
	theoretical discourses, touching on everything from literature and history 
	to architecture. What unites them is a suspicion of universal knowledge. 
	Modern science, being the ideal type of such knowledge, naturally became a 
	target of postmodernist critics. Sure, there were many critics of this 
	universal science, including prominent scientists themselves before the 
	advent of postmodernism, but their criticisms were leveled at the abuses of 
	science, not at its logic. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As disillusionment with the 
	military–industrial complex grew in the West in the wake of the Vietnam war 
	and civil rights struggles, the top–down model of development in India led 
	to a radical critique of science, in which its claims to objectivity and 
	universality were questioned. In India well–known public intellectuals Ashis 
	Nandy, Vandana Shiva, Shiv Vishvanathan, Claude Alvares and others condemned 
	modern science as being innately barbaric, violent and even genocidal 
	because of its reductionism and its imposition of western interests and 
	values in collusion with westernised Indian elite. But the critique of 
	science and technology that emerged out of the so–called ‘Delhi school of 
	science studies’ was not limited to uses or abuses of science: it questioned 
	the content and methodology of science as we know it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No one can deny that there are 
	alternative, culture–dependent descriptions of nature: the world is full of 
	a vast variety of such descriptions. Given this diversity, can we not say 
	that modern science provides us a closer, a more approximate representation 
	of nature which is more adequately supported by evidence and logic? Not so, 
	according to its critics, because the standards of truth and falsity are 
	also relative to the ‘form of life’ of a culture. To quote two leading 
	theorists of the ‘social constructivist’ school: “the labels ‘true’ and 
	‘false’ are simply different names for cultural preferences.” The grand 
	conclusion of this school of thought is that all ways of knowing are at par 
	because all are culturally embedded attempts to understand brute reality. 
	There is only one reality, different cultures approach it differently, each 
	of which is rational in its own context. (If you replace culture with caste 
	in this statement, you get the golden rule of Hinduism that all paths to 
	truth are different only in name) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Social constructivists do not deny 
	that modern science has discovered some truths about nature that are 
	universally valid — Newton’s law of gravity for example. But even these 
	universals are seen as products of the Judeo–Christian and masculine 
	assumptions of Western cultures. To paraphrase Sandra Harding, one of the 
	best known proponents of feminist standpoint epistemology, other cultures 
	are capable of producing alternative universals of their own. Which 
	culture’s universals get universalised and which ones are consigned to the 
	status of ethno–sciences, is not decided by superior explanatory power, but 
	by superior political power. Well–known scholars including Andrew Ross and 
	David Hess wrote books arguing that the line between accepted science and 
	heterodox sciences of cultural minorities is an arbitrary construct 
	reflecting cultural and ideological interests of those in power. Dipesh 
	Chakrabarty, a subaltern historian, expressed the sentiment well when he 
	wrote that “reason is but a dialect backed by an army.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Presenting India as source of 
	alternative universals that could heal the reductionism of western science 
	became the major preoccupation of Indian followers of science studies. 
	Vandana Shiva wrote glowingly of Indian views of non–dualism as superior to 
	western reductionism. Ashis Nandy declared astrology to be the science of 
	the poor and the non–westernised masses in India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prayers to smallpox goddesses, 
	menstrual taboos, Hindu nature ethics which derive from orthodox ideas about 
	prakriti or shakti, and even the varna order were defended as rational (even 
	superior) solutions to the cultural and ecological crises of modernity.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All this fitted in very well with 
	western feminist and ecologists’ search for a kinder and gentler science. 
	Prominent feminist theorists (led by Carolyn Merchant and Evelyn Keller) 
	condemned the separation of the subject from the object as a sign of 
	masculine and dualist Judeo–Christian thinking. The history of modern 
	science was rewritten to decry the progressive secularisation or 
	disenchantment of nature as a source of oppression of nature and women. This 
	naturally created an opening for eastern cultures, especially India, where 
	such secularisation of nature is frowned upon by religious doctrines and 
	cultural mores. In the recent literature on Hindu ecology, the most orthodox 
	philosophies of Hinduism, including Advaita Vedanta, where vitalistic ideas 
	of life–force (shakti, Brahman) are embodied in all species through the 
	mechanism of karma and rebirth, began to be presented as more conducive to 
	feminist and ecological politics. The deep investment of these philosophies 
	in perpetuating superstitions and patriarchy in India was forgotten and 
	forgiven. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The critics went further: They 
	argued that if, in the final analysis, all representations of nature are 
	cultural constructions, then different cultures and subcultures should be 
	permitted to construct their own representation of nature. To judge other 
	cultures from the vantage point of modern science, as the Enlightenment 
	tradition demanded, amounted to an act of “epistemic violence” against the 
	other, as Gayatri Spivak called it. This became the foundation of what is 
	called postcolonial theory, which argued that leading lights of the Indian 
	Renaissance such as Nehru, Bankim Chandra and Ram Mohan Roy were mentally 
	colonised because they were seeing India through western conceptual 
	categories. Any change that challenged India’s “unique cultural gestalt”, as 
	Nandy liked to call it, was to be resisted. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All told, preservation of cultural 
	meanings took priority over validity. Objectively false cosmology of the 
	‘other’ was not to be challenged because it gave meaning to people’s lives. 
	Any demand for self–correction of local knowledges was routinely decried as 
	a rationalist ‘witch–hunt’. The alternative to universalism was that of 
	‘critical traditionalism’ or ‘borderland epistemologies’. Cultures should be 
	encouraged to create an eclectic mix of different and even contradictory 
	ways of knowing. One need not reject modern science altogether, but rather 
	selectively absorb it into the Indian gestalt: Contradictions were not to be 
	questioned and removed, but rather celebrated as expressions of difference.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The picture of science that social 
	constructivism offers is tailor–made for the doublespeak of Vedic science. 
	All the major conclusions of science studies — culturally different but 
	equally rational paths to truth, equation of universalism with colonialism 
	and totalitarianism, penchant for eclecticism and hybridity, and the 
	condemnation of disenchantment of nature — end up restating the fundamental 
	assumptions which the nationalist neo–Hindus have always used to assert the 
	superior ‘scientificity’ of Hindu metaphysics and mysticism. Postmodern 
	prophets who promise us a kinder gentler science do indeed face backward to 
	the spirit–soaked metaphysics of orthodox Hinduism, which has, in fact, 
	inhibited the growth of reason, equality and freedom in India. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While the Abrahamic religions are 
	wary of epistemological relativism out of the fear of relativising the Word 
	of God revealed in the Bible or the Koran, Brahminical Hinduism (and Hindu 
	nationalism) thrives on a hierarchical relativism to evade all challenges to 
	its idealistic metaphysics and mystical ways of knowing. Rather than accept 
	the naturalistic and empirical theories of modern science as contradicting 
	the Vedantic philosophy – which they actually do — Hindu nationalists simply 
	declare modern science to be true only within its limited materialistic 
	assumptions. They do not reject modern science (who can?) but ‘merely’ treat 
	it as one among the many different paths to the ultimate truth, which is 
	known only to the Vedic Hinduism. By enshrining relativism as a source of 
	empowerment of the weak, social constructivist theory has unintentionally 
	provided intellectual respectability to the strategy of hierarchical 
	inclusivism which is the time–tested method of Hindu apologetics. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me, very briefly, give some 
	examples of this convergence between supposedly emancipatory postmodernist 
	deconstruction of science and the clearly reactionary, chauvinistic 
	doublespeak of Vedic science. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For starters, take attempts to 
	‘decolonise’ modern science: by viewing nature through local conceptual 
	categories of women, non–western people and other cultural minorities, Hindu 
	nationalists see themselves as a part and parcel of this postcolonial 
	enterprise. They justify developing a science in accord with the Vedic 
	cosmology as an attempt to decolonise the ‘Hindu mind’ of western, 
	Semitic–monotheistic influences. Indeed, scholar–activists sympathetic to 
	the Hindu worldview, including Rajiv Malhotra and Koenard Elst routinely 
	cite the writings of Ashis Nandy, Ronald Inden and even Gayatri Spivak as 
	allies in a shared project of understanding India through Hindu categories.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Like the postmodernist supporters of 
	ethno–sciences, they do not deny that modern science has discovered some 
	truths about nature. But they declare them to be lower–level truths, because 
	they merely deal with dead matter, shorn of consciousness. Notwithstanding 
	all pious declarations of the ‘death’ of the Newtonian world view of matter 
	obeying mechanical laws, the fact is that any number of rigorous, 
	double–blind tests have failed to show any signs of disembodied 
	consciousness or mind–stuff in nature: matter obeying mindless laws of 
	physics is all there is. But in the Vedic science discourse, the 
	overwhelming evidence for adequacy of matter to explain the higher functions 
	of mind and life are set aside as a result of ‘knowledge filtration’ by 
	western–trained scientists. Take the example of the emerging theory of 
	‘Vedic creationism’ (which updates the spiritual evolutionary theories of 
	Sri Aurobindo and Swami Vivekananda). Its chief architects, Michael Cremo 
	and Richard Thompson, claim that Darwinian evolutionary biologists and 
	mainstream biologists, being products of the western ontological 
	assumptions, have been systematically ignoring and hiding evidence that 
	supports the theory of ‘devolution of species’ from the Brahman through the 
	mechanism of karma and rebirth. All knowledge, they claim, parroting social 
	constructivism, is a product of interests and biases. On this account, Vedic 
	creationism, explicitly grounded in Vedic cosmology is as plausible and 
	defensible as Darwinism, grounded on the naturalistic and capitalist 
	assumptions of the western scientists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Vedic creationism is only one 
	example of ‘decolonised science’. More generally, Hindu nationalists 
	routinely insist on the need to develop a science that is organically 
	related to the innate nature, svabhava or chitti of India. India’s chitti, 
	they insist, lies in holistic thought, in keeping matter and spirit, nature 
	and god together (as compared to the ‘Semitic mind’ which separates the 
	two). Hindu nationalists have been using this purported holism of Hinduism 
	as the cornerstone of their argument: any interpretation of modern science 
	that fits in with this spirit–centered holism is declared to be valid Vedic 
	science while naturalistic, mainstream interpretations are discarded as 
	‘western’. The overwhelming enthusiasm for Rupert Sheldrake’s occult biology 
	(which builds upon the failed vitalistic theories of Jagdish Chandra Bose) 
	and the near unanimous recasting of quantum mechanics in mystical terms are 
	examples of the kind of critical traditionalism and hybridity sanctioned by 
	postmodernists. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But it gets worse. As is well known, 
	Hindu nationalists have been keen on proving that the landmass of India was 
	the original homeland of the ‘Aryans’ and therefore the cradle of all 
	civilisation. ‘Vedic Aryans’, on this account, were the authors of all 
	natural sciences which then spread to Greece, Sumeria, China and other major 
	civilisations in antiquity. To substantiate these claims, all kinds of 
	modern scientific discoveries are read back into the Rig Veda, the most 
	ancient of all Vedas. But such boastful claims raise the question of 
	methodology. How did our Vedic forebears figure out the speed of light, the 
	distance between the sun and the earth and why did they code it into the 
	shape and size of fire altars? Similar questions arise for the more general 
	claims that are basic to Hindu metaphysics, namely that there is a higher 
	realm of ultimate reality (Brahman) that cannot be assessed through sensory 
	means. How did our Vedic forbears know it exists and that it actually 
	determines the course of evolution of species, and makes the matter that we 
	all are made of? How can you experience what is beyond all sensory 
	knowledge? But even more important for the claims of scientificity of the 
	Vedas, how do you test the empirical claims based upon that experience?
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Here one finds an incredibly brazen 
	claim for relativism and the culture–boundedness of rationality. Because in 
	Hinduism there are no distinctions between the spirit and matter, one can 
	understand laws that regulate matter by studying the laws of the spirit. And 
	the laws of spirit can be understood by turning inward, through yoga and 
	meditation leading to mystical experiences. Supporters of this 
	mysticism–as–science argue that all science gains its coherence from within 
	its own culturally sanctioned assumptions; modern science puts an artificial 
	limit on knowledge as only that knowledge which can be accessible to senses. 
	Within Hinduism however, it is as rational and scientific to take the 
	non–sensory ‘seeing’ — that is mystical and other meditative practices — as 
	empirical evidence of the spiritual and natural realm. This purported 
	scientificity of the spiritual realm, in turn, paves the way for declaring 
	occult New Age practices like astrology, vastu, and quantum healing and even 
	yagnas as scientific within the Vedic–Hindu universe. This defence of parity 
	(i.e. equal rationality) of the Vedic method of non–sensory, mystical 
	knowing is fundamentally a social constructivist argument: it assumes that 
	all sciences are valid for a given community that shares a fundamental 
	metaphysics. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Long ago, Julien Benda wrote in his 
	La Trahison De Clercs, that when intellectuals betray their calling — that 
	is, when intellectuals begin to exalt the particular over the universal, the 
	passions of the multitude over the moral good — then there is nothing left 
	to prevent a society’s slide into tribalism and violence. Postmodernism 
	represents a treason of the clerks which has given intellectual 
	respectability to reactionary religiosity. With the best intentions of 
	giving marginalised social groups — especially if they were women and if 
	they belonged to the non–western world —the right to their own ways of 
	knowing, western academics, in alliance with populist Third Worldist 
	intellectuals, have succeeded in painting science and modernity as the enemy 
	of the people. Rather than encourage and nurture a critical spirit toward 
	inherited traditions, many of which are authoritarian and patriarchal, 
	postmodernist intellectuals have waged a battle against science and against 
	the spirit of the Enlightenment itself. As the case of Vedic science in the 
	service of Hindu nationalism in India demonstrates, this misguided attack on 
	the Enlightenment has only aided the growth of pseudoscience, superstitions 
	and tribalism.&nbsp; </font></p>
