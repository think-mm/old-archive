	&nbsp;<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">I have been a reader&nbsp; and 
  contributor of&nbsp; mukto-mona.com for many years now. I personally interacted 
  with avijit and jahid vai many times, don’t know if they still remember me. 
  All this time I had this idea that mukto-mona is always 
  progressive.Intellectuals have always been in support for democracy and 
  specially for Bangladesh democrazy(crazy).I think more then a year ago I wrote 
  an article in muktomona forum,stating that, people of Bangladesh are not yet 
  civilized enough to deserve democracy. They love anarchy, they just love to 
  create havoc. Many people protested. Well we have seen 15 years of&nbsp; democrazy 
  and have seen the last of it. I know most of the moderators here live in 
  abroad. Brother Avijit left Singapore for USA.Jahid vai, you are also in usa 
  for long time now.This person,farid hossain , who thinks Bangladesh army is 
  same as Pakistani army(crack),I heard you also left Bd.I ask why? All of you 
  people love democrazy so much, then why didn’t any of you choose to live in 
  democratic Bangladesh? Why is it that, people feel 1000 times more secured in 
  Bangladesh after it is no more democratic.Ask anyone, who lives in Bangladesh. 
  I just came back from Europe yesterday, and in the airport the custom didn’t 
  even check my luggage, cause two military persons were standing by, they knew 
  they had no chance of harassing me and getting money from my pocket. All of us 
  were so stunned by the behavior of customs. Yes we want this Bangladesh. We 
  want Bangladesh to be always under caretaker govt. or army, until it becomes 
  civilized. I am telling it again and I will tell it 1000 times, that the 
  people of Bangladesh are still not civilized, to have to freedom to make his 
  own decision. Can you remember how these same people, these same customs 
  officers, same police officers treated you or me? Cause it was their fathers 
  own property, oh my great democratic Bangladesh. Anybody could anything, just 
  stand in the street and declare that I am from this xyz party and I want 
  tomorrow to be hartal and any car you bring out in the street tomorrow, I will 
  burn it. Its my democratic right. People who write from abroad about 
  Bangladesh politics.Please stop writing.It is really easy for you people to 
  cry for democrazy.I ask all of you to leave usa , Canada&nbsp; and come back to bd 
  and then write for democrazy. I think it has become a fashion now, to support 
  democrazy. Man I live in Gulshan and my office is in uttara. During all those 
  democratic hartal and oborodh, when I had to travel by local bus and my 
  parents spent sleepess times, if I would ever return home in one piece. I 
  don’t know how anyone still justify democrazy in Bangladesh. Yes democracy 
  suits all those nations in Europe,where people has some brain matter in their 
  head. Who knows burning a car, burning a shop, everything you do to hurt your 
  countries economy, will hurt you one day.</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But, I am specially astonished to see 
  the petition here, for the freedom of the Universtiy teachers. I wonder, why 
  most people prefer foreign universities and private universities in Bangladesh 
  now. Because teachers like these, who are actually nothing but dirty political 
  agents of different parties, spoil the lives of our students. Teachers like 
  these are curse for our nation. People like farid hossain, who thinks that 
  Bangladesh army is from mars and they love their country less than the great 
  patriotic leaders of our country, never even consider once about writing 
  something about these teachers. How clinically they are destroying the 
  education backbone of a poor country. These people deserves to be hanged. Why 
  on the earth, students need to be pursued into politics. Look at India and 
  their young generation. Just banking on them, their merit and smartness, India 
  is cruising today. And look at our universities, leave alone a proper standard 
  of education, we can’t even provide them with a safe environment. These 
  teachers, what do they want? Why would they provoke students for &nbsp;rioting? How 
  much money do they get from the politicians? Is that money more important than 
  the future of our country? I don’t know, how can the citizens of a country 
  become so selfish, that they can only worry about their own pocket&nbsp; and their 
  own children. Its known that their children doesn’t have to go to DU or CU, 
  they have USA,Aus,Canada everything available. I guess not many soldirs and 
  even officers of Bangladesh army has enough money to send their kids to these 
  international universities.They must be more worried about the existence of 
  pure education environment of these universities. People should grow up, out 
  of their pak hanadar mentality. These are our own fathers, sons and brothers. 
  You have seen for 15 years, where our country has gone. The number 1 thief&nbsp; in 
  the whole world. What worse can anyone do, what shame can even a general bring 
  now? It would be really difficult to emulate tareq zia or hasina in corruption 
  even if anyone wants to. So please stop crucifying the govt., only because it 
  is supported by army. All of us who live in Bangladesh can feel the change. 
  Like what I felt in zia airport yesterday. This small changes, small small 
  changes can change our life, our attitude. I think many have visited western 
  countries. Dealt with their officials, police. &nbsp;Didn’t you think that , this 
  is really a civilized country?&nbsp; All the businessman , shop owners everyone is 
  soooo angry at the govt. If you want to change a country, from the number 1 
  corrupted nation to something acceptable, we have to accept this phase.If we 
  just let the flow of corruption continue, a day would have come, when there 
  would have been no law and order or administration. Problem is that, we only 
  like to think about the present. A little patience, a little unity, can move 
  us forward as a nation. Not only the people gulshan,banani or dhanmondi. We 
  can keep our head high, only if our whole nation moves forward. Just making 
  money by any means, like we had been doing for the last 35 years, would never 
  help the poor people, and the country would never progress, only the selected 
  few will become zillionaires. We have to sense that and try to help this 
  government. Give them a chance man, what can ssc failed illiterate politicians 
  do better?</span></p>
