	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I was in the school we read a 
	short story of Sanjeeb Chatterji where the writer said, &quot;Manush briddho Na 
	hoiley sundar hoi na&quot;. At that time it was contrast thinking for me. Now I 
	understand what the writer really wanted to mean. In fact life shows it’s 
	real color when we are in a certain age. To fathom the hidden message of 
	life we need experience, a professional experience of life. How this 
	realization comes may differ from person to person. A true perception of 
	life depends on how we take life in our real lives. The day my dear history 
	professor Narayan Chandra Shaha died at the age of 78, I was at his bedside. 
	I was a young man of 22 years and it was my experience to see a man dying. 
	It was around 3 am in the morning I was seating beside his, everything was 
	quiet and serene. Suddenly he raised his right hand and called me closer to 
	him. He came out of his comma and smiling. He told me, don’t call the 
	doctor, my time is almost over. I can see an endless road before me and want 
	to take that journey. Besides that I see everything in a void. All my life, 
	all my efforts to learn more and all my endeavors to make me immortal are 
	just evaporated into the thin air. I am free, I am emancipated’. He closed 
	his eyes. His grip on my hand eased and fell off. Such was the memory of his 
	death and such was the beauty of life I saw in death. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My personal experience of life is 
	that memory plays a great role in solidifying the meaning of life. In fact 
	life is nothing but a bed of memory. Many carry them in their hearts and 
	many share them with others. Life itself is a solitary experience unless we 
	give company to it. There is a speed in life which can be measured in our 
	life spans. The very big questions of life such as to be successful, to 
	achieve fame and gather wealth and above all how to surpass the barrier of 
	time and space are answered by our understanding of life. A time comes when 
	we all realize our limitations and gather enough power to come to terms with 
	the realities. For that we don’t need a chartered accountants help to find 
	out where we have failed and where we have been successful. This is amazing 
	because it’s all about our lives, the most important sensation of being in 
	the world, but still we can come to a conclusion by ourselves. This is what 
	I call the eternal power of life. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Many years before in Singapore I was 
	passing through a house and saw small child seating on the lap of a very old 
	woman. It was a very normal and ordinary scene. Now after so many years I 
	don’t take that scene as an ordinary one. In this scene I saw a rupture and 
	a unity in the endless journey of time. A huge gap of time made peace in a 
	very forceful way. The eternity showed its beauty through this 
	rapprochement. Despite the fact that I am a very devoted fan of Shakespeare, 
	I don’t take everything he said about life. Many people have a tendency to 
	quote Shakespeare to interpret life. They are true if we put them in a 
	personal perspective but I find them too philosophical. I do accept their 
	poetic and emotional beauty but not in the general terms. For example when 
	Macbeth says, ’Out, out, brief candle! Life is but a walking shadow,a poor 
	player. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no 
	more; it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying 
	nothing. This interpretation of life is nothing but a personal one and that 
	also a product of Macbeth’s actions. There is a tremendous mixture of beauty 
	and pain in our lives. The roars, the ups and downs and finally the endless 
	silence, all make life a matter of great importance. There is a message of 
	integrity, a message of reality and among all these variations there is a 
	message of unity.</font></p>
