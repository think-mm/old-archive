	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Britain is known as the cradle of 
	Democracy. The world owes for it to Britain. Now the same country does 
	something which is totally against the very spirit of democracy. Who will 
	save whom? Britain has decided to give Sharia-the Muslim Religion Legal 
	system to have equal status &amp; empowers this system to solve the secular 
	problems of the Muslim society in the nation. The Archbishop of Canterbury 
	Dr. Williams is the man who has provided the ground for its smooth sailing. 
	The logic &amp; objective behind his arguments are that though Britain has its 
	vibrant legal system, but society is governed by its religious customs &amp; 
	conventions. He has gone to the extent of arguing that it is necessary to 
	create the social cohesion in the nation. There are different social 
	immigrants religious groups like Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Christians etc who 
	are wedded to their different religions. Their daily non- economic &amp; non- 
	educational lives are governed by their religious customs &amp; conventions. So 
	why not their social &amp; marital disputes be decided by their religious legal 
	codes? They had been evolved throughout the ages. How by giving Sharia the 
	legal powers the British Muslims will be the part of main western culture? 
	He failed to explain that. On the contrary this action will pave the way for 
	creating the Muslim residents areas as 'no go areas'. Their localities 
	(areas) will be ghettoized. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our discussion is in relation to 
	Muslim Personal Law-particularly the applications of SHARIA- in the life of 
	British Muslim Citizens. Our simple question is; Is there any difference 
	between the Muslim Personal Law Sharia &amp; British Law? What is the difference 
	between the Natural Law or Just Law &amp; Revealed religious law like Sharia? 
	The Natural Law is evolved on the basis of Human needs. Its basic assumption 
	is to create such legal conditions in the society under which the human 
	being can live happily &amp; develop his human potentialities. It provides the 
	congenital climate, atmosphere &amp; the frame of legal structure under which 
	each citizen feels secure, protected &amp; live without any personal whims of 
	the man or the religious dogmas and fatwas. According to Thomas Hobbes 
	the Natural Law is the creation of the people among themselves for their 
	mutual happiness and prosperity. He further argued that the origin and 
	evolution of the natural law by the human beings have brought the human life 
	from the brink of solitary, poor, brutish, short lives to the present human 
	lives. Another important feature of the Natural Law is that it evolves 
	according to the needs of the society. It is dynamic. There are 
	possibilities of changes in the application of Natural Laws. It is impartial 
	and publicly knowable. As for example laws regarding slavery, hours of 
	working for the laborers, voting rights, marriageable age of man and woman, 
	regarding the laws of inheritance, and reformative theory of criminal 
	punishments .we find lot of changes from generations to generations in these 
	laws. Here the law is known as the rule of law not the rule of man. All 
	religious laws are supported by their religious books, customs &amp; 
	conventions. They are considered as sacrosanct and have revealed sanctions. 
	They are the creation of Supernatural authority and or by the prophet 
	himself. So laws like Sharia are not amenable to modifications or 
	amendments. We cannot make any necessary changes according to the needs of 
	the present social order. Sharia had been created by more than one thousand 
	years before according to that age needs. Now if the country like Britain, 
	tries to create conditions favorable for the application of Sharia to its 
	Muslim citizens what will be the future of coming Muslim Generations? Let us 
	see how Sharia punishes its followers for the criminal offences. These 
	crimes are punished by specific penalties, such as death by stoning, lashes, 
	the severing of a hand and head etc. For the crime as adultery the 
	punishment is death by stoning, for the crime as the theft, cutting of the 
	hand, eye for eye, ear for ear, and limb for limb etc. We do not know what 
	compels the liberal country like Britain to go for the Sharia Laws for its 
	Muslim Populations. When the demand or voice comes from the Christian Clergy 
	like the archbishop of Canterbury we smell something serious. There is a 
	world wide demand for the revival of religious faith. Logic of the situation 
	compels us to think that all religious zealots want to reestablish their 
	hegemony over the secular life of their believers. Adoption of the Sharia in 
	Britain will pave the ways for Christians, Hindus and others to demand the 
	same in their democratic nations. Then where they we will lead to the 
	mankind? The legal sanctions to the Sharia Laws will give free way to the 
	Political Islam to do whatever it thinks right. Just like the lesson of our 
	childhood story when the man allows his camel to put its one leg inside the 
	tent because of the shivering outside atmosphere, ultimately the camel 
	throws the man outside the camel takes the possession of the tent. Those who 
	fail to learn the lessons of the history they will commit the same mistake. 
	Let sane voice prevails among the people of the Britain including its Muslim 
	population. </font></p>
