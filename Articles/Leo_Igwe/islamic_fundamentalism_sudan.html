												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												<p align="justify">In November, 
												the world came close to 
												experiencing the kind of 
												insanity, violent protests and 
												riots that engulfed many parts 
												of the globe following the 
												printing of the cartoons of 
												prophet Mohammed by European 
												newspapers in 2006.</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												Gillian Gibbons, a British 
												teacher working in Sudan was 
												arrested and jailed for 15 days 
												for allowing her pupils to name 
												a teddy bear Mohammad. Like the 
												cartoon riots, this incident has 
												once again revealed the illogic, 
												unreason, absurdity and foolery 
												that underline the islamic 
												fundamentalist mindset.</p>
												<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify"><b>What 
												happened?</b></p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												In September, Ms Gibbons asked 
												one of the pupils in her class 
												to bring her teddy bear and 
												asked the class to pick names 
												for it. The children came up 
												with several names including 
												Abdullai, Hassan and Mohammad. 
												Then she asked them to vote on a 
												name. And most of them chose the 
												name Mohammad. </p>
												<p align="justify">Each of the 
												pupils was told to take the bear 
												home at weekends and told to 
												write a diary about what they 
												did with it. The entries of the 
												pupils were collected in a book 
												with a picture of the bear on 
												the cover and a message, which 
												read, “My name is Mohammed”. 
												Some parents of the pupils were 
												irked by this assignment. They 
												complained to Sudan’s Ministry 
												of Education. And the police 
												seized the book, arrested 
												Gillian, charged and sentenced 
												her to 15days in jail with 40 
												lashes. Few days after the court 
												ruling, muslim fanatics marched 
												in Sudan’s capital Khartoum, 
												calling for a tougher sentence. 
												They gathered in Martyrs Square 
												outside the presidential palace 
												in the capital carrying knives 
												and sticks denouncing the United 
												Kingdom (UK) and Europe, and 
												calling for the execution of Ms 
												Gibbons. But eight days into her 
												jail sentence, Ms Gibbons was 
												pardoned and released. She has 
												since returned to the UK.</p>
												<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify"><b>Action and 
												Misinterpretation</b></p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												I want us to take a critical 
												look at what Ms Gillian Gibbons 
												did or was alleged to have done. 
												Particularly, how her action was 
												twisted out of context to serve 
												the bloody interests of fanatics 
												in Sudan.<br>
												First of all, Ms. Gibbons asked 
												her pupils to give the teddy 
												bear any name of their choice. 
												She didn’t tell them the names 
												they should give it. And I 
												wonder which teacher would have 
												done otherwise. The pupils came 
												up with 20 names including 
												Muhammad. Mind you, not prophet 
												Mohammad. And she asked them to 
												choose their most favorite name. 
												And the pupils, not Ms Gibbons, 
												chose to name the bear Mohammad. 
												The decision of the pupils 
												should not be a surprise to 
												anyone as Mohammad is 
												understandably the most popular 
												name in Islamic societies. And 
												Gillian respected the choice of 
												the pupils and the teddy bear 
												was named Mohammad, just as many 
												parents in Islamic societies 
												name their children Mohammad or 
												allow them to bear the name – 
												Mohammad.</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												<b>Questions Arising</b></p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												And if I may ask, in what way 
												does this constitute an insult 
												to Islam? In what sense does 
												this offend the sensibilities of 
												muslims in Sudan? Definitely in 
												the fanatical sense. Islamic 
												fundamentalism prevails in Sudan 
												and forms the basis of its 
												government and state law. It is 
												important to note that the teddy 
												bear was named Mohammad, not 
												prophet Mohammad. And any clear 
												thinking fellow knows -and 
												should know- that there is an 
												ocean of difference between 
												Mohammad and prophet Mohammad. 
												Unfortunately, muslim extremists 
												and theocrats in Sudan could not 
												differentiate between “Mohammad 
												teddy bear” and “Prophet 
												Mohammad teddy bear”. For them, 
												any nomination of Mohammad 
												refers to Prophet Mohammad, and 
												therefore constitutes an insult 
												to Islam.<br>
												Furthermore, how does naming a 
												teddy bear Mohammad or even 
												prophet Mohammad constitute an 
												insult to Islam? Is Mohammad not 
												a name – a combination of 
												letters – formed by human beings 
												prior to the birth of prophet 
												Mohammad? What makes this 
												combination of letters something 
												that cannot be extended to a 
												toy?<br>
												Is Mohammad not a name given to 
												the founder of Islam as it is 
												given to other individuals that 
												exist or have existed in 
												history? I mean, what is wrong 
												in naming a toy Mohammad, Jesus, 
												Abraham, Buddha, Vishnu, Yahweh, 
												God or Allah? And how does that 
												diminish the sacredness, which 
												believers have invested on these 
												vacuous nomenclatures? </p>
												<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify"><b>An Act of 
												Terrorism</b></p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												The conviction of Gullian 
												Gibbons is simply act of Islamic 
												terrorism against human rights, 
												modernity, liberal education and 
												civilized values.</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												Islamic terrorists are not only 
												hijacking planes and bombing 
												train stations, they also 
												control governments and use 
												their powers to impose their 
												dark and retrogressive visions 
												on the society. Islamic 
												terrorists are not only snuffing 
												out innocent lives using bombs, 
												guns and grenades; they also 
												target, convict and victimize 
												innocent persons using warped 
												anachronistic legal systems. So, 
												what transpired at the Unity 
												School in Sudan was indicative 
												of how education and academic 
												freedom are held hostage in the 
												country by Islamic extremists. 
												It is a clear testimony of the 
												extent islamic fanaticism poses 
												a threat to modernity, progress, 
												civilization and development in 
												Sudan. What happened to Ms. 
												Gibbons is a pointer to how 
												corrupt, backward and 
												disconnected a nation is and 
												could become when it allows its 
												public space, its courts, its 
												constitution and conscience to 
												be dominated and directed by 
												religious throwbacks. It is a 
												clear evidence of how much work 
												is needed to bring Africa’s 
												largest country into the 21st 
												century.</p>
												<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify"><b>Politics 
												and Islamic Fundamentalism in 
												Sudan</b></p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												Since independence, Islamic 
												fanaticism has systematically 
												undermined the politics and 
												progress in Sudan. In 1983, 
												Sudan, under Major General 
												Gaafar Mohammed, adopted Islamic 
												law as state law, causing a 
												serious rift between Arab 
												muslims in the North and the 
												black African Christians and 
												animists in the South. The 
												adoption of Sharia led to a 
												bloody civil war between the 
												government of Khartoum under the 
												influence of the National 
												Islamic Front and the Southern 
												rebels led by the Sudan People’s 
												Liberation Army (SPLA)</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												In 2002, a cease-fire was 
												declared between the government 
												in Khartoum and the SPLA And in 
												2004, a deal was signed ending 
												20 years of war and bloodshed. 
												At least 20 million people lost 
												their lives to that war. As the 
												civil war in the South was 
												coming to an end, another war 
												broke out in the Northern 
												western region of Darfur between 
												the government-backed militia – 
												the Janjaweed – and villagers 
												and rebel groups in the region. 
												The massacres by the 
												pro-government militia led to 
												the death of over 200,000 people 
												and the displacement of over a 
												million persons. The Islamic 
												government in Khartoum remains 
												adamant and defiantly opposed to 
												efforts by the UN – and the 
												international community to stop 
												the violence and restore peace 
												and security in the region. Its 
												policies have brought the people 
												of Sudan hatred, division, 
												stagnation, bloodshed, 
												displacement of persons, 
												slavery, human rights abuses and 
												international isolation.</p>
												<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify"><b>
												Envisioning A New Sudan</b></p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												The time has come for the people 
												of Sudan to start envisioning a 
												new country that will be a 
												radical departure from the past, 
												and the present. The people of 
												Sudan need to start working for 
												a revolution that will enthrone 
												a modern, united and progressive 
												state. The new Sudan will be a 
												secular democracy not an Islamic 
												theocracy. It will be racially 
												inclusive and religiously 
												neutral, that is unbiased for or 
												against Arabs or Africans, 
												Muslims or Christians, animists 
												or atheists. The new Sudan will 
												provide a socio-political 
												framework for all Sudanese to 
												live together in peace despite 
												the race, color, religion 
												belief, ethnicity, sex or sexual 
												orientation</p>
												<p align="justify">Like the 
												present day Turkey, the new 
												Sudan will erect a wall 
												separating mosque (church, 
												shrine) and state, and enthrone 
												a government that does not 
												legislate or discriminate 
												against individuals on the basis 
												of Islam or any religious belief 
												or unbelief.</p>
												<p align="justify">The new Sudan 
												will be an impartial arbiter and 
												guarantor of the equal rights of 
												all Sudanese including the 
												rights to profess any religion, 
												to change one’s religion or to 
												entertain no religious beliefs. 
												The new Sudan will not harbor or 
												sponsor terrorists, or undermine 
												international peace and 
												security.</p>
												<p align="justify"><br>
												Instead it will be a bastion of 
												hope, freedom, progress, human 
												rights, enlightenment, 
												secularism and renaissance. It 
												is this new Sudan that will 
												rectify the theocratic 
												dislocation, fanatical 
												corruption and distortion that 
												plague this nation. It is this 
												new Sudan that will heal the 
												wounds of war, tension, division 
												and sanctions that have 
												dominated the history and 
												politics of the country since 
												independence.</p>
