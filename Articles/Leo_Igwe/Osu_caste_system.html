											The Osu caste system is an obnoxious 
											practice among the Igbos -in 
											Nigeria-which has refused to go away 
											despite the impact of Christianity, 
											modern education and civilization, 
											and the human rights culture. In 
											this piece, I will argue that the 
											Osu discrimination is an outdated 
											tradition with no basis for its 
											continued practice and observance in 
											the contemporary Igbo society.</font></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
											<font size="2">Traditionally, there 
											are two classes of people in 
											Igboland – the Nwadiala and the Osu. 
											The Nwadiala literally meaning ‘sons 
											of the soil’ are the freeborn. They 
											are the masters. While the Osu are 
											the slaves, the strangers, the 
											outcasts and the untouchables. <b>
											Chinua Achebe in his well-known 
											book, <i>No Longer At Ease</i> asks: 
											What is this thing called Osu? He 
											answers: “Our fathers in their 
											darkness and ignorance called an 
											innocent man Osu, a thing given to 
											the idols, and thereafter he became 
											an outcast, and his children, and 
											his children’s children forever” </b>
											The Osu are treated as inferior 
											human beings in a state of permanent 
											and irreversible disability. They 
											are subjected to various forms of 
											abuse and discrimination. The Osu 
											are made to live separately from the 
											freeborn. In most cases they reside 
											very close to shrines and 
											marketplaces. The Osu are not 
											allowed to dance, drink, hold hands, 
											associate or have sexual relations 
											with Nwadiala. They are not allowed 
											to break kola nuts at meetings. No 
											Osu can pour libation or pray to God 
											on behalf of a freeborn at any 
											community gathering. It is believed 
											that such prayers will bring 
											calamity and misfortune.</font><span style="color: #333333"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
											<font size="2">A human rights group 
											outlined the atrocities meted out 
											against the Osu in Igboland. They 
											include: ‘parents administering 
											poison to their children, 
											disinheritance, ostracism, organized 
											attack, heaping harvest offering 
											separately in churches, denial 
											membership in social clubs, violent 
											disruption of marriage ceremonies, 
											denial of chieftaincy titles, 
											deprivation of property and 
											expulsion of wives etc.”</font><span style="color: #333333"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
											<font size="2">The Osu caste 
											discrimination is very pronounced in 
											the area of marriage. An Osu cannot 
											marry a freeborn. The belief is that 
											any freeborn that marries an Osu 
											defiles the family. So freeborn 
											families are always up in arms 
											against any of their members who 
											wants to marry an Osu. They go to 
											any length to scuttle the plan. 
											Because of the Osu factor, marriages 
											in Igboland are preceded by 
											investigations-elders on both sides 
											travel to native villages to find 
											out the social status of the other 
											party. And if it is found that one 
											of them is an Osu, the plan would be 
											automatically abandoned. Many 
											marriage plans have been aborted, 
											and in fact some married couples 
											have been forced to divorce because 
											of the Osu factor. Chinua Achebe 
											also noted this in his book. When 
											Okonkwo learns that his son wants to 
											marry Clara, an Osu. Okonkwo says: “ 
											Osu is like a leprosy in the minds 
											of my people. I beg of you my son 
											not to bring the mark of shame and 
											leprosy into your family. If you do, 
											your children and your children’s 
											children will curse you and your 
											memory… You will bring sorrow on 
											your head and on the heads of your 
											children.” </font>
											<span style="color: #333333">
											<font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
											<font size="2">But there have been 
											several efforts and initiatives to 
											eradicate this harmful tradition. In 
											1956, the government of the then 
											Eastern Nigeria passed a law 
											abolishing the Osu caste system. The 
											law freed and discharged anybody 
											called Osu including the children 
											born to such a person. It declared 
											the practice unlawful – and a crime 
											punishable by law. But 
											unfortunately, 50 years after the 
											enactment of this legislation, 
											nobody has been prosecuted or 
											convicted for breaking the law. At 
											best what the legislation has 
											achieved is to drive the practice 
											underground. Also many religious 
											leaders and traditional rulers have 
											spoken out against the practice. 
											Recently Eze Enyeribe Onuoha, the 
											traditional ruler of Umuchieze 
											autonomous community in Imo State 
											urged his community members to 
											abandon the practice. He said: 
											“discrimination against Osus is 
											irrational, illegal, unjust and 
											archaic and opposed to human rights. 
											It is one Umuchieze(Igbo) tradition 
											that should immediately be 
											abolished.” </font>
											<span style="color: #333333">
											<font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
											<font size="2">But statements and 
											declarations like this are not 
											uncommon. But they have always 
											fallen on deaf ears among the Igbo 
											people most of whom think that 
											cultural norms are sacrosanct and 
											should not be tampered with. So the 
											belief in and practice of Osu caste 
											system continue to wax strong in 
											Igboland. In 1997, a person alleged 
											to be an Osu was made a chief in a 
											community in Imo State. But six 
											months later, the community was 
											engulfed in a crisis. And when the 
											case was brought to the court, the 
											presiding judge noted that though 
											the abolition of Osu caste system 
											was in the statute, it was an 
											unenforceable law. The chief was 
											dethroned so that peace would reign 
											in the community.<br>
											<br>
											And not too long ago I met a lady in 
											a friend’s house in Lagos. I was 
											told that she was engaged to a young 
											man from Imo State. And months later 
											I learnt that the marriage plan had 
											been abandoned because the lady was 
											said to be an Osu. There have been 
											several instances like that where 
											young men and women of Igbo 
											extraction have suffered heartbreaks 
											and emotional traumas as a result of 
											this cultural disease. And now the 
											question is, why is it that this 
											cultural practice has refused to go 
											away even among educated Igbos. The 
											reason is not far fetched. The 
											practice of Osu caste system is 
											hinged on religion, supernaturalism 
											and theism. And Igbos are deeply 
											religious and theistic people. Osu 
											are regarded as unclean or 
											untouchable because they are 
											(alleged to be) dedicated to the 
											gods. So it is the dedication to the 
											gods that makes the Osu status a 
											condition of permanent and 
											irreversible disability and stigma.
											</font><span style="color: #333333">
											<font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
											<font size="2">So this cruel custom 
											will not be eradicated until Igbos 
											begin to realize that gods are 
											imaginary beings, not objective 
											entities. Igbos need to understand 
											that deities and spirits are mental 
											constructs used to control and 
											organize the society at the infancy 
											of the human race. And today that 
											humanity has come of age. Because if 
											one does not believe that the gods 
											and spirits are real, then the idea 
											of treating someone as unclean or 
											untouchable because the person is 
											dedicated to any deity does not make 
											sense at all. Even for the 
											god-believing Igbos, the practice is 
											out rightly baseless. Because most 
											Igbos are Christians and do not 
											profess any belief in the 
											traditional gods to which the Osu 
											were (alleged to be) dedicated. So, 
											it is both sensible and appropriate 
											that all Igbos - believers and 
											non-believers alike renounce and 
											abandon this abhorrent, inhuman and 
											despicable practice. Politically, 
											state authorities must get Igbo 
											communities and associations to 
											remove provisions in their 
											constitution that bar Osu from 
											contesting elections or receiving 
											traditional titles. Legally, the 
											courts must begin to enforce the law 
											abolishing the Osu caste system. And 
											the Nigerian state must rise up to 
											its duty of protecting and defending 
											the humanity, dignity and equal 
											rights of all citizens irrespective 
											of their sex, ethnic origin, 
											religion, belief or birth status.</font><span style="color: #333333"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
											<font size="2">Most importantly 
											Igbos must begin to envision a new 
											society where people can live and 
											interact, marry and be married, 
											elect and be elected, without 
											division, distinction, 
											discrimination on the basis of Osu 
											or Nwadiala. Hence I want to use 
											this opportunity to appeal to my 
											people-<i>ndi Igbo</i>: <b>Please 
											let’s strive to remove this mark of 
											leprosy and shame from the face of 
											our culture and society.</b></font></font></p>
