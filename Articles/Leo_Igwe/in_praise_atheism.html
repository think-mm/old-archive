												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												<p align="justify">As an 
												atheist, sometimes, I wonder why 
												it has taken human beings so 
												long to realize that there is no 
												god and that the so-called 
												creator, almighty, all merciful, 
												all knowing, and all-what-again 
												god that humans have worshiped 
												for ages is a fantasy, a figment 
												of human mind and imagination, 
												without any real instance, 
												essence, existence or 
												significance. </p>
												<p align="justify">Because I 
												think the non existence of god 
												is so commonsensical a fact and 
												really does not require any 
												mental rigor to understand. God 
												by definition has properties and 
												attributes that make him/her/it 
												unknowable, tenable, and an 
												existential impossibility. They 
												include attributes like 
												infinity, omniscience, 
												omnipotence, omnipresence etc. 
												Just observe nature and you will 
												know that it has no god. And 
												that this city of humanity is a 
												self regulating entity. So, I 
												regard the idea of god‚Äôs 
												existence as the most 
												nonsensical of all nonsense. 
												Yes, the god idea is a lie, 
												complete absurdity. The whole 
												concept of god‚Äôs existence is 
												total, absolute and arrant 
												nonsense. The ‚Äòfather figure 
												in the sky‚Äô is a mental block 
												to proper understanding of life 
												nature and reality. My only 
												concern is this: why has it 
												taken the world so long to know 
												this. Why are many people still 
												holding on to this illusion in 
												spite of modern civilization, 
												renaissance and enlightenment? 
												Why have most human beings on 
												earth yet to acknowledge this 
												simple fact. That god has no 
												real existence. </p>
												<p align="justify">The god-idea 
												may have served some good for 
												some people in the past and in 
												the present. There is no doubt 
												about that. But that does not 
												change its epistemic value or 
												character. Does it? That a 
												superstitious belief is 
												comforting doesn‚Äôt make it 
												science. Does it? That most 
												people in the world today 
												believe in god does not negate 
												the fact that god is a concept 
												without content. Or better a 
												concept that contains whatever 
												we ‚Äìhumans-invest on it. </p>
												<p align="justify">So when I 
												consider the amount of energy, 
												time, money and other resources 
												that believers invest or better 
												waste revering this non entity 
												called god or the number of 
												lives snuffed out over the ages 
												by religious militants, 
												jihadists, suicide bombers and 
												other that kill in the name of 
												one god or the other, I cannot 
												but shudder at the depth and 
												profundity of human stupidity 
												and foolery. On the other hand I 
												cannot but appreciate the 
												wisdom, insight, excellence ad 
												beneficence in the atheistic 
												worldview. The psalmist was 
												wrong for saying that ‚ÄòThe 
												Fool has said in his heart, 
												there is no god‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure 
												that the author of the Psalms, 
												like other ancient writers of 
												the holy books, got something 
												wrong somewhere. What the Fool 
												really said in his heart is 
												‚ÄòThere is god‚Äô. Because it 
												requires the suspension of 
												one‚Äôs reason and intelligence 
												to believe in the existence of a 
												deity and to spend one‚Äôs life 
												time worshiping this 
												transcendental illusion. </p>
												<p align="justify">By saying 
												this I don‚Äôt mean to insult 
												any body or hurt anyone‚Äôs 
												sentiments. Far from it. I just 
												want to state what I think are 
												very bitter and brutal facts-
												</p>
												<p align="justify">There is no 
												god(Allah). There is no devil. 
												There is no heaven. There is no 
												hell. There are no spirits, no 
												angels, no demons, no witches or 
												wizards. There is no life after 
												death. Human beings have no 
												immortal soul. The Bible is not 
												the word of god. The Koran was 
												not revealed by Allah. The holy 
												books were written by human 
												beings. Jesus is not the son of 
												god. Jesus is not the saviour of 
												the world. Jesus did not rise 
												from the dead. Jesus did not 
												ascend into heaven. Jesus is not 
												coming again. Rapture is not 
												taking place. Mohammed was not 
												sent by Allah. Mohammed did not 
												ascend into heaven in a flaming 
												horse. Praying is like talking 
												to somebody who is not there. 
												Jerusalem is not a holy land. 
												Mecca is not a holy land. 
												Eternal bliss is an illusion. 
												Religion is superstition. </p>
												<p align="justify">These are 
												truths. These are truths every 
												human being should know. These 
												are truths that should guide us. 
												There are truths that should 
												government the world. </p>
												<p align="justify">But I know 
												some people will not accept 
												them. Some people will not want 
												to hear them at all. Some people 
												will find them offensive. Some 
												people will regard as 
												blasphemies. But offence or no 
												offence, these are truths that 
												are critical to the liberation 
												and emancipation of human beings 
												in this 21st century. These are 
												truths that will enlighten and 
												civilize the world. These truths 
												will surely awaken human beings 
												especially those of us in Africa 
												from our religious and 
												supernatural slumber. Because 
												the god idea and the religious 
												nonsense that goes with it have 
												caused darkness and made human 
												beings to fall asleep. And 
												humans have slept to the point 
												of forgetfulness, crass 
												gullibility, and foolery. Humans 
												have slept to the point of 
												stupor. And now is the time to 
												wake up to a dawn, a life and a 
												world without god. </p>
												<p align="justify">Human beings 
												need to wake up because the day 
												break of a new Enlightenment is 
												here. Unfortunately, some 
												religious apologists continue to 
												maintain that the realization of 
												god‚Äôs non-existence will lead 
												to social chaos or anomie in the 
												world. They propagate this 
												falsehood to make the whole idea 
												of a god-free world undesirable. 
												Sadly they are greatly mistaken. 
												The global acceptance of god‚Äôs 
												non existence will pave the way 
												for the realization of universal 
												humanism. In fact global atheism 
												will usher in a new world, a new 
												life and a new hope. Global 
												atheism will help bring a 
												lasting solution to 
												Israeli-Palestinian conflict and 
												other faith based conflicts that 
												are ravaging the world. Global 
												atheism will help rein in 
												Islamic militants, suicide 
												bombers and other religious 
												warriors that are threatening 
												and terrorizing the world. Most 
												importantly global atheism will 
												make humans to live better and 
												to become fully human. Because 
												it is when human beings know 
												that there is no deity to help 
												or save them that they will sit 
												up and without reservations, 
												help and save themselves. No one 
												will waste precious time praying 
												to the imaginary Father in 
												Heaven for ‚Äúthy kingdom come‚Äô 
												Instead every body will work 
												diligently and conscientiously 
												to protect and preserve the 
												earthly kingdom. Human beings 
												will take their destinies fully 
												in their hands and make the best 
												out of this one life we have by 
												striving to realize heaven here 
												on earth</p>
