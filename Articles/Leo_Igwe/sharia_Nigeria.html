											<font face="Arial Narrow">On October 
											9, 2007 a court in Kaduna-Northern
											<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1192632782_4" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">
											Nigeria</span> heard a case brought 
											against Shehu Sani- a well-known 
											human rights activist, social critic 
											and author. Mr. Sani-a practicing 
											Muslim- was sued by a group called 
											Concerned Sharia Forum over a play- 
											Phantom Crescent- he wrote exposing 
											the abuses and double standards by 
											those implementing Sharia law in 12 
											states in Northern Nigeria. Northern 
											Nigeria is predominantly Muslim but 
											has a sizeable Christian population 
											including those from the South who 
											reside there. The court has ordered 
											Mr. Sani to cancel a planned 
											performance of the play and to stop 
											printing and distributing copies of 
											the play. This court case has a lot 
											of implications for human rights, 
											democracy and civilization in
											<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1192632782_5" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">
											Nigeria</span>. It is the first time 
											such a case is brought against a 
											Muslim who is critical of this 
											anachronistic legal system since 
											sharia was imposed on Islamic 
											majority States some years ago. This 
											court case is coming up at a time 
											Islamic fundamentalism is on the 
											rise in Nigeria-and around the world 
											-with Sharia as one of its most 
											deadly and oppressive weapons.<br>
											<br>
											<b>Allegory of the Cave Replayed</b><br>
											<br>
											Shehu Sani said he wants to use the 
											play to enlighten the local 
											population on how Sharia is being 
											used to oppress them. And 
											practically speaking, this is a tall 
											order, which is likely get him into 
											trouble with the Islamic theocrats 
											and jihadists who do not tolerate 
											any form of 'enlightenment' that is 
											critical of Islam. Again 
											educationally, the Islamic majority 
											States are the most backward in
											<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1192632782_6" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">
											Nigeria</span>. This is because the 
											only form of education most people 
											are exposed to is Quranic recitation 
											and indoctrination, which numbs and 
											dumbs their minds making them 
											impervious to critical thinking 
											especially in matters concerning 
											Islamic creeds and traditions.&nbsp; 
											Quranic indoctrination has 
											imprisoned and corrupted the minds 
											and conscience of the local islamic 
											population, making them easy tools 
											for manipulation and exploitation by 
											Islamic Jihadists and theocrats. 
											Unfortunately most Muslims in 
											Northern Nigeria are in the dark as 
											to how Islam has been used to 
											oppress, exploit and tyrannize over 
											their lives. And a few of them who 
											have realized the unjust nature of 
											the system are too afraid to speak 
											out against it. Hence the task of 
											enlightenment in Northern Nigeria is 
											a dangerous undertaking because most 
											Muslims cannot reason outside the 
											Quran and Islam. They take Islamic 
											darkness as light, and violently 
											oppose any form of enlightenment 
											outside Islam, opposed to Islam or 
											critical of Islam. <br>
											<br>
											Muslims in Northern Nigeria are 
											living in an Islamic Cave manned, 
											managed and guarded by the armies 
											and bigots of Allah. And as in 
											Plato’s Allegory of the Cave, Shehu 
											Sani in like one who was once in the 
											cave, and who went outside, saw the 
											light, and has come back to 
											enlighten his people.&nbsp; And this case 
											brought against him by Sharia 
											proponents is like a resistance 
											staged against him and his 
											enlightenment agenda by lieutenants 
											guarding the cave of Islamic 
											ignorance, fanaticism and foolery in 
											Northen

											<br>
											<b>Human Rights Abuses </b><br>
											&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
											One of the ways Islamic 
											fundamentalists have demonstrated 
											their moral backwardness, bankruptcy 
											and ignorance is through gross human 
											rights violations. Islam is 
											inherently opposed to human dignity 
											and equality, gender equity and 
											justice. According to Mr. Sani, the 
											play dramatizes the human rights 
											violations perpetrated against women 
											and poor people by the Hisbah. 
											Hisbah&nbsp;&nbsp; is a bunch of jihadists 
											masquerading as Sharia police or 
											enforcers, funded with state money. 
											Human rights abuses did not start 
											with Hisbah. It has been there since 
											the introduction of Islam to
											<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1192632782_8" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">
											Nigeria</span>. Particularly since 
											the Jihad of Sheikh Uthman Dan Fodio. 
											The 1804 Jihad sanctified militant 
											Islam-that is spread and propagated 
											by human rights violations-killing, 
											maiming, torture, oppression of 
											women, children and poor people. 
											Since independence, thousands- tens 
											of thousands- of Nigerians have lost 
											their live to religious bloodletting 
											in
											<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1192632782_9" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">
											Nigeria</span>. In March this year, 
											a Christian School teacher from 
											Southern Nigeria was lynched by 
											Muslim pupils for allegedly 
											desecrating the Koran. And last 
											month, Islamic Jihadists attacked 
											and killed at least 9 Christians and 
											burnt several churches in
											<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1192632782_10" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">
											Kano</span>- a Sharia implementing 
											state and an Islamic stronghold. In 
											2000, sharia riots across
											<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1192632782_11" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">
											Nigeria</span> claimed thousands of 
											lives.<br>
											<br>
											Indeed, the blood of “unbelievers”, 
											the oppression of the poor, the 
											exploitation of the weak and 
											ignorant, the discrimination against 
											women, the persecution of sexual 
											minorities and the abuse of children 
											have watered the tree of Islam in 
											Northern Nigeria. <b>And today, 
											Sharia has become a potent tool in 
											the hands of Islamic Jihadists for 
											human rights violation, oppression 
											and exploitation in the name of 
											Allah.Sharia has become a weapon for 
											islamic inquisition in
											<span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1192632782_12" style="CURSOR: hand; BORDER-BOTTOM: #0066cc 1px dashed">
											Nigeria</span>. There are no women 
											among the Sharia court judges. 
											Sharia does not recognize the rights 
											of all individuals to freedom of 
											thought, conscience and religion. It 
											has no place for equal rights of all 
											human beings regardless of religion 
											or belief. Sharia accords 
											second-class status to non-Muslims. 
											Some Sharia States in Nigeria have 
											carried out amputations, and have 
											flogged convicted offenders 
											including Christians. Some years 
											ago, international outcry saved the 
											lives of Safiatu Hussein and Amina 
											Lawal who were sentenced to death by 
											stoning for adultery. Many people 
											convicted under Sharia law- to be 
											stoned or amputated – are 
											languishing in jails across Northern 
											Nigeria.<br>
											</b><br>
											So, this case brought against Shehu 
											Sani in going to be a landmark case. 
											It is going to determine the 
											direction Sharia States want to go 
											–whether they want to come into the 
											21st century or remain in the Dark 
											Age with their moral and legal 
											anachronisms. This trial is going to 
											serve as a litmus test of Nigeria's 
											commitment to human rights and 
											civilized values. It is going to 
											provide an opportunity for the 
											Sharia states to tell the world if 
											they want to embrace Enlightenment, 
											secular and open society or remain 
											in the cave of darkness, ignorance, 
											hypocrisy, hatred, violence, 
											oppression, exploitation, and human 
											rights abuses. So in this very case, 
											it is not just Shehu Sani that is on 
											trial, the Sharia states are on 
											trial. The Nigerian constitution is 
											on trial. The Nigerian democracy is 
											on trial.
