												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												Traditional African Value System</font></h3>
												</font>
												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												<p align="justify">Africa is a 
												deeply patriarchal society. Men 
												dominate the socio-economic and 
												political machinery and 
												organizations. Men are regarded 
												as natural leaders, who are 
												superior and born to rule over 
												women. Women are considered 
												weaker vessels-extensions of men 
												and secondary human beings. The 
												pride and dignity of women are 
												derived from and dependent on 
												men.</p>
												<p align="justify">Hence, 
												African societies attach more 
												value and importance to a male 
												child than to a female child. 
												Ten daughters are not worth a 
												son. No woman is regarded as 
												complete or real until she gives 
												birth to a male. Delivering a 
												son gives a woman pride and a 
												place at her husband's home. It 
												is said that every married woman 
												stands with one leg in her 
												husband's house until she gives 
												birth to a male child.</p>
												</font>
												<font face="Verdana" size="2">
												<h3 align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												Traditional African Practices</font></h3>
												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												<p align="justify">Like the 
												traditional African value 
												system, most traditional African 
												practices are fundamentally 
												biased against women and 
												gender-insensitive. Little 
												wonder, then, it is upheld as a 
												traditional practice in many 
												parts of Africa for girls as 
												young as seven to be married to 
												men old enough to be their 
												fathers, and in some cases, 
												grandfathers. Parents determine 
												who marries their daughters 
												before they are old enough to 
												decide for themselves. Moreover, 
												with the payment of the dowry, a 
												girl is bought and automatically 
												becomes the property of the man, 
												who uses, mistreats, and dumps 
												her when he deems fit.</p>
												<p align="justify">Polygamy is 
												another traditional custom that 
												prevails in Africa. Men are 
												licensed to marry as many wives 
												as possible. In fact, in many 
												communities, men measure their 
												wealth and influence by the 
												numbers of women they have and 
												control. It is regarded as a 
												taboo, however, for a woman to 
												have more than one husband. In 
												the event of the husband's 
												death, the woman is subjected to 
												several gory and excruciating 
												traditional funeral rites 
												popularly known as widowhood.</p>
												<p align="justify">This is a 
												period of mourning, which lasts 
												one, two, or more years 
												commencing with the death of a 
												woman's spouse. During this 
												period, a woman is made to walk 
												and move barefoot, haggard, 
												unkempt, and wearing rags or 
												black clothes. She is not 
												allowed to wear earrings, cover 
												her hair, or even smile.</p>
												<p align="justify">In some 
												communities, the widow pours 
												ashes on her body and is made to 
												sleep with the husband's corpse 
												for a night, or drink the water 
												used in washing the corpse if 
												she is suspectedas is often the 
												caseof causing her husband's 
												death. As part of the tradition, 
												the eldest man in the family 
												inherits the woman. Otherwise, 
												she is evicted from the 
												husband's house with her 
												children, and her property is 
												confiscated.</p>
												<p align="justify">The practice 
												of female genital mutilation (fgm)-otherwise 
												known as female 
												circumcision-prevails as a 
												tradition in Africa. This 
												process entails the partial or 
												total cutting away of the 
												external female genitalia. 
												Traditional healers, birth 
												attendants, or elderly women 
												usually carry out the practice. 
												The procedure is often carried 
												out in a septic environment with 
												crude instruments such as 
												knives, razor blades, and broken 
												glasses, without anesthetics, 
												or, at best, herbal medication 
												to check bleeding and lessen 
												pain. This crude and hazardous 
												procedure is grounded in and 
												surrounded by various myths, 
												misconceptions, and 
												superstitious nonsense. For 
												instance, the ritual is 
												performed as a rite of passage, 
												for preparing young girls for 
												womanhood and marriage. Many 
												also believe that it prevents a 
												woman from giving birth to a 
												stillborn child. In some parts 
												of western Nigeria, it is 
												regarded as a taboo for the head 
												of the child to touch the 
												mother's clitoris during 
												delivery. Some of the proverbs 
												that support and underscore 
												these mythical postulations 
												include:&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify">&quot;The clitoris 
												is a cap of prostitution which 
												the vagina wears from heaven.&quot;</p>
												<p align="justify">&quot;If we don't 
												clip the clitoris, it is going 
												to be asking great sacrifices 
												from the penis when it grows.&quot;</p>
												<p align="justify">&quot;The fortune 
												gathered by the penis is taken 
												up by the vagina.&quot;</p>
												<p align="justify">Even though 
												they predate the coming and 
												spread of Islam, traditional 
												African practices are closely 
												related and allied with Islamic 
												teachings, traditions, and 
												customs.</p>
												</font>
												<h3 align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												Relationship with Islam</font></h3>
												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												<p align="justify">Islam is a 
												male-made religion, founded on 
												masculinity, patriarchy, and 
												male domination. It is notorious 
												for its repression, subjugation, 
												and discrimination against 
												women. Islamic religion portrays 
												women as inferior to men in 
												every respect-spiritually, 
												physically, mentally, and even 
												intellectually. Islam's holy 
												book, the Koran, divinely 
												sanctions and decrees this 
												negative impression. The Koran 
												has been corroborated by the 
												Hadiths (traditions of 
												Muhammad's sayings and deeds) 
												and perpetuated by the 
												interpretation of the mullahs, 
												the sheiks, and the imams.&nbsp;</p>
												<p align="justify">As in the 
												traditional African context, men 
												are regarded as superior to 
												women. &quot;Men are in charge of 
												women because Allah hath made 
												one to excel the other&quot; (Sura 
												4:34). Male children are 
												preferred to females that bring 
												gloom and despair. As Sura 43:15 
												relates: &quot;yet when a new-born 
												girl is announced to one of them 
												his countenance darkens and he 
												is filled with gloom.&quot;</p>
												<p align="justify">As a 
												religious norm, Muslim women and 
												girls are subjected to various 
												forms of victimization and 
												discrimination. They are not 
												allowed to move about unveiled, 
												nor are they allowed to vote, 
												hold public office, or have 
												social, political, or economic 
												power. They are not given the 
												freedom to choose their marriage 
												partners. Their parents betroth 
												them to the Mallams and the 
												Alhajis in order to cultivate 
												friendship, and to extend and 
												cement bonds between families. 
												For instance, in 
												Muslim-dominated northern 
												Nigeria, child marriages and 
												arranged marriages are still 
												commonplace. Consequently, the 
												dreadful disease called 
												vesico-vaginal fistula (VVF) is 
												widespread and endemic.</p>
												<p align="justify">Islam also 
												endorses polygamy. Though Muslim 
												men are allowed to marry more 
												than one wife, their women are 
												forbidden to keep more than one 
												husband. If the woman loses her 
												husband, she is subjected to all 
												sorts of deprivations and 
												humiliation akin to the widow's 
												plight in the traditional 
												African setting. She is entitled 
												to only a quarter of the legacy, 
												and if the deceased has more 
												than one wife, the wives are 
												obliged to share a quarter or 
												one-eighth of the legacy.</p>
												<p align="justify">Traditional 
												African practices are closely 
												related to Islam where fgm is 
												concerned. This vicious ritual 
												has been defended and justified 
												by many Muslim scholars and 
												jurists as an Islamic custom. 
												They have argued that it is 
												consistent with Islamic piety 
												and purity. Muslim women and 
												girls are therefore excised and 
												infibulated in the name of Allah 
												and Muhammad, his prophet.</p>
												<p align="justify">Here is a 
												short description by a Muslim, 
												M.A.S. Mustafa, of the process 
												of infibulation in a Muslim 
												community in Djibouti:</p>
												<p align="justify">&quot;The little 
												girl, entirely nude, is 
												immobilized in the sitting 
												position on a low stool, by at 
												least three women. One of them 
												has her arms tightly around the 
												little girl's chest. Two others 
												forcibly hold the child's thighs 
												apart, in order to open wide the 
												vulva. The child's arms are tied 
												behind her back or immobilized 
												by two other women. The 
												traditional operator says a 
												short prayer: 'Allah is the 
												greatest and Muhammad is his 
												prophet. May Allah keep away all 
												evils.' She then spreads some 
												offerings on the floor to Allah 
												(split maize, or, in urban 
												areas, eggs). Then the old woman 
												takes her razor from top to 
												bottom of the small lip, and 
												scrapes the flesh from inside 
												the large lip. This nymphectomy 
												and scraping are repeated on the 
												other side of the vulva.&quot;</p>
												<p align="justify">Moreover, the 
												Islamic faith is associated with 
												the use of Juju, charms, and 
												amulets-another practice very 
												common in Africa. Muslims and 
												Africans believe these fetishes 
												and concoctions scare away evils 
												and misfortune, to kill one's 
												enemies, and to enhance one's 
												progress and success in life. In 
												Nigeria, Muslim spiritualists 
												are reputed for their 
												extraordinary feats in Juju and 
												the production of talismans.</p>
												<p align="justify">By 
												sanctioning many traditional 
												African practices, Islam, unlike 
												other alien religions, has been 
												very instrumental in the 
												continuation of these customs. 
												Islam is one of the greatest 
												obstacles to the efforts to 
												eradicate harmful and inhumane 
												traditional practices in Africa.</p>
												</font>
												<h3 align="justify">
												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												Changes and Challenges</font></h3>
												<font face="Verdana" size="3">
												<p align="justify">One of the 
												most interesting and challenging 
												experiences I have had as a 
												humanist in the past couple of 
												years has been trying to 
												persuade my people to abandon 
												these horrible and primitive 
												customs. I have tried to 
												persuade them to see the need 
												for progress and improvement in 
												our attitudes, value and 
												society. We must openly examine 
												the traditions we have held and 
												accepted as sacrosanct. Many of 
												these traditions are founded on 
												traditional dogma, ignorance, 
												and superstition.</p>
												<p align="justify">I am glad to 
												say that the momentum is 
												building, and the changes are 
												coming. Increasing numbers of 
												individuals and groups are 
												rising up against traditional 
												practices that cannot withstand 
												logical and/or scientific 
												scrutiny. Those beliefs, 
												customs, and rituals are founded 
												on myths, pseudoscience, or 
												fringe science.</p>
												<p align="justify">Today Africa 
												is witnessing enormous and 
												appreciable changes in the 
												perception and status of women. 
												Many African women have been 
												consistent and courageous in 
												their demand for justice and 
												equality with men. They want 
												recognition and respect for 
												their right to marry the mates 
												of their choice, whenever and 
												wherever they wish. They want 
												their rights to reproductive 
												health and integrity respected. 
												They want the right to divorce 
												and to own property.</p>
												<p align="justify">In spite of 
												the threats of Islamic 
												fundamentalism, many Muslim 
												institutions, individuals, and 
												groups have been very supportive 
												of and solidly behind the 
												process of change and moral 
												progress. In December, 1997 we 
												witnessed a landmark and 
												unprecedented judgment when an 
												Egyptian court upheld the ban of 
												female genital mutilation and 
												rejected the claim of Islamic 
												religious justification. This 
												timely verdict sent a very clear 
												message to the Islamic world. 
												Islam cannot stop the process of 
												eradicating female genital 
												mutilation and harmful 
												traditional practices. Islam 
												cannot subvert or obstruct 
												enlightenment, progress, 
												socio-economic reforms, and 
												moral improvement in Africa.</p>
												<p align="justify">Nevertheless, 
												I must say that it is not yet &quot;uhuru.&quot; 
												Africa is still under the hard 
												and harsh grip of poverty, 
												illiteracy, superstition, and 
												religious fundamentalism. So 
												long as these social and mental 
												cankerworms are at work, the 
												struggle continues.</p>
