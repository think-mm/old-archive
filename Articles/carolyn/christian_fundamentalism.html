	<p class="MsoNormal" align="center">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;“I’ve never 
	been to a Bible study like this!” Dorothy Jones burst out—Sister Jones, she 
	was called at Tabernacle Baptist, the church where her husband Reverend 
	Loren Jones was the minister. Silence fell on the small room at the back of 
	the tiny, rundown church. “I’ve never heard anyone ask these kinds of 
	questions like you’re asking. If the Bible says it, I believe it, and that’s 
	all I need to know!” She spit the words at me, her eyes glittering with 
	hatred and suspicion. “I don’t think you are of God, that’s all I have to 
	say. I think you’re of the devil, and I’m not having anything more to do 
	with you!” The church matriarch, called Mother Louis Parker, nodded 
	emphatically in agreement and said “Amen!” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This was one of my first encounters 
	with the phenomenon called Christian fundamentalism. It left me stunned and 
	bewildered. It took me fourteen more years of living in Oklahoma, in the 
	midst of pervasive right-wing Christianity, to understand why Dorothy 
	reacted as she did, and what the wider implications of her reaction might be 
	for this country. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Enid, Oklahoma</b> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">My husband Roy and I, and our then 
	one-year-old daughter Phoebe, moved from Chicago, where I grew up, to Enid, 
	Oklahoma, a town of about 40,000, in 1986. We were Christian, and Roy had 
	taken a position at a seminary as an Assistant Professor. Phillips 
	Theological Seminary, on the campus of Phillips University, with a second 
	branch in Tulsa, was the only mainline Protestant seminary within hundreds 
	of miles. All the others were conservative and evangelical. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Roy and I had been members of a 
	socially active, liberal church in the neighborhood surrounding the 
	University of Chicago. Shortly before we moved, I developed the notion that 
	when Jesus said, “Feed the hungry, visit the sick, clothe the naked, visit 
	those in prison,” he didn’t just mean “Drop checks into the offering plate.” 
	I began to think he meant that the poor—marginalized people, people 
	oppressed by an unjust society—and the non-poor, should know one another as 
	fellow members of communities. I began to want to somehow meet as friends 
	with the sorts of people who were the invisible recipients of the funds the 
	church collected for various beneficent causes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This impulse of mine led us in many 
	directions, including to Tabernacle Baptist Church. Enid, the fourth-largest 
	city in largely rural Oklahoma, rises like an outpost from the plains in the 
	middle of the state. Wheat is its only industry, and poverty and its 
	attendant ills are widespread. At the time we lived there, Enid was sharply 
	segregated racially—it probably still is. African Americans lived in a 
	section of the town people referred to as Southern Heights, which was 
	separated from the rest of the town by a wide road. Its inhabitants rarely 
	ventured outside its borders. The area was a desolate landscape of tiny, 
	run-down clapboard houses, dirt streets, vacant lots, and humble churches 
	with names </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">like First Missionary Baptist (one 
	of many African American churches mysteriously set on fire in the region in 
	1996) and Tabernacle Baptist. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Soon after we moved to the town, my 
	family and I began attending University Place Christian Church, or UP, the 
	white, liberal church associated with Phillips University. I was surprised 
	at how much emphasis UP gave to “evangelism,” or telling people about 
	Christianity and asking them to join the church—much more than liberal 
	churches we knew of in Chicago. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even so, it was not unusual to hear 
	UP members express contempt for Christian evangelicals and fundamentalists. 
	I remember feeling that such comments seemed harsh and unfair. Sometimes I 
	asked people why they felt such antipathy. I suggested maybe we should build 
	bridges with these fellow Christians. I found that my responses led people 
	to assume I was fundamentalist, and to be suspicious of me. I found this 
	funny at the time. Me, a fundamentalist! What a thought! I’d grown up in the 
	liberal neighborhood of Hyde Park in Chicago. I didn’t even really know what 
	fundamentalism was. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In our adult Sunday school class, I 
	talked about my impulse to get to know those we usually only clucked our 
	tongues over and sent charity to. Partly because of my input, the class 
	decided to address the issue of segregation in the town. We decided to 
	invite African Americans to visit our class and join our discussion. The 
	delegates who came were Dorothy Jones and Louise Parker. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When, after discussing the problem, 
	we asked Mrs. Jones what, in her opinion, we should do about Enid’s racial 
	segregation, her answer was swift and direct: “Come to our church,” she 
	said. So Roy and I did. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tabernacle Baptist’s members greeted 
	us at first with an enthusiasm so great that it bordered on adulation. 
	Reverend and Mrs. Jones praised us to the congregation for the courage we 
	showed in taking Mrs. Jones up on her invitation, and the congregation 
	responded with shouted “Amen”s. Reverend Jones’s sermon that day was typical 
	of African American preaching, building to a fever pitch and eliciting 
	shouts of “Hallelujah,” “Amen,” and “Thank you, Jesus!” from the tiny 
	congregation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Frankly, the fervor of the 
	congregation’s welcome and style of worship embarrassed us. We came to them 
	out of our liberal guilt, feeling our visit was a woefully inadequate 
	attempt to address the vast wrong of racism, yet it seemed they were 
	deferring to us because we were white. We really didn’t feel we were doing 
	anything impressive, by simply attending a service at their church. I also 
	sensed dimly then what I have since come to know with painful clarity, that 
	the flip side of idealization is hatred and rejection. I sensed that what 
	underlay the “over-the-top” adulation for us by these poor (as in 
	low-income) African Americans was fear and loathing for us as whites in a 
	racist culture. I couldn’t help believing that they felt we expected them to 
	treat us the way they did, that they feared that if they did not, there 
	would be repercussions. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Their embrace, literal and 
	figurative, perplexed us, but at the same time, I couldn’t help soaking it 
	in. It assuaged the alienation I felt out on the Oklahoma plains in general, 
	and it was so different—so much warmer—than the reception I received at 
	University Place. When I took baby Phoebe to the UP nursery for the first 
	time, another mother stared at me coldly without answering when I introduced 
	myself to her. I later learned that she was one of the church’s most 
	right-wing members. I guess she recognized my liberal stripes by instinct on 
	first sight. So Roy and I put aside our discomfort at the loud intensity of 
	the Tabernacle congregation’s services, and their strange and 
	disproportionate admiration for us, and began dividing our attendance 
	between there and University Place. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I was perplexed when Mrs. Jones and 
	others spoke, as they often did, of their admiration for such people as Pat 
	Robertson and Jerry Falwell. Dorothy expressed outrage about the accusations 
	against the Bakkers, founders of the PTL (Praise the Lord) Club and the 
	Heritage USA Christian theme park. When Jim and Tammi Faye were indicted for 
	stealing $3,700,000 in offerings and using the money to pay for sexual 
	services, private jets and other personal extravagances, Dorothy (whose 
	money was probably included in the Bakker’s illegal nest egg) said it was 
	one more example of how our nation unjustly persecuted Christians. At the 
	time, I saw her anger as well-intentioned, even poignant, naivete. I felt 
	our friendship gave me the chance to satisfy my curiosity about 
	fundamentalism, a worldview so mysterious to me, so different from my own.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Roy and I became more involved at 
	Tabernacle, we discussed with Dorothy and others ways we could continue to 
	address the problem of racial segregation in Enid. We agreed we should 
	encourage more white people to visit. We formed a Bible study on Wednesday 
	evenings, to which we invited members of our UP Sunday school class. A few 
	actually came. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One Wednesday, we were discussing 
	the Psalm that says God has laid out our future for us before we are 
	conceived. One of the UP member said it seemed to him the Psalm contradicted 
	the message of free will he saw at the heart of Jesus’ sayings. How could we 
	choose whether to love or not love our neighbor, and be judged for our 
	decision, if our life was already laid out for us? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This was when we received the 
	response from Dorothy Jones that begins this account. By this time, Roy and 
	I had been attending Tabernacle Baptist for more than a year. We were 
	actively involved in the church, and considered Dorothy and Loren Jones to 
	be close friends. Reverend Jones had even appointed Roy as an Associate 
	Pastor, in keeping with the church’s informal, ad hoc style. Even so, after 
	this Bible study, Dorothy Jones never spoke to us again. We understood that, 
	if the minister’s wife and the matriarch agreed that we were “of the devil,” 
	we were effectively barred from services. When I phoned Dorothy, she hung up 
	on me. I sent her several letters and cards asking if we could discuss the 
	matter, but she did not answer them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the year or so we attended 
	Tabernacle, we met and got to know other African American ministers and 
	church members. A conversation I had with one minister sticks in my mind. It 
	was imperative, he said, that we (Christians) convert as many people 
	(“sinners”) as possible. He said that was the only task that was important 
	in our lives. I responded that, for me as a Christian, the most important 
	task was to love one another, as Jesus stated. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Yes, exactly,” the minister 
	answered. “We must reach out to Jews, Buddhists, Catholics, and all 
	heathens, to bring them to Christ. How can I say I love them, if I don’t try 
	to save them from hell?” I protested that I didn’t think it was legitimate 
	to call Buddhists, Jews and Catholics heathens, that it was important to 
	respect other people’s different beliefs. “I respect them, and it’s my job 
	as a Christian to do all I can to bring them to the Lord,” he answered.
	</font></p>

	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">The Liberal Response </font></b>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Roy and I kept feeling our longings 
	to meet and get to know marginalized people. In addition to our forays into 
	South Enid and Tabernacle Baptist, we formed a community at UP that met 
	weekly for a potluck evening meal in a seldom-used dining room. We invited 
	UP members, as well as people we had met in South Enid. It was a chance for 
	poor and middle-class people to eat and pray together, and to pool our 
	resources—of knowledge, money, skills, insights, our presence—toward meeting 
	one another’s needs—for friendship, the support of a community, and 
	materials. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The community made what seemed like 
	miraculous differences in the lives of many of its members, including ours. 
	Roy and I were invigorated and enlivened by our participation in ways we had 
	never known before. Acceptance by the community meant that one man, who was 
	schizophrenic, and homeless, found the symptoms of his illness diminished. 
	This meant he was able to apply for and receive Social Security disability 
	benefits, and move off the street into his own apartment. The father of a 
	family of four had become disabled and could not work. The community 
	provided support for the two children and purchased a washer and dryer for 
	the family. The community helped an older member who was blind and 
	alcoholic, who lived in an abandoned chicken coop, to stop drinking and move 
	into a nursing home, where he worked in the laundry room. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The community, while it was 
	enlivening to its members, caused suspicion and discomfort in the UP 
	congregation. One deacon—deacons are laypeople who contribute money, perform 
	rituals, and exert influence—told me I was “a crazy dreamer” for thinking 
	poor and nonpoor people could be friends. Another prominent member 
	complained to us that we were enabling laziness on the part of the family 
	for whom we bought the washer and dryer. The minister did not talk about the 
	community in services or any other church forums, so it remained more or 
	less invisible. Only one middle-class UP member, besides Roy and me, 
	attended the weekly meetings on a regular basis. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The man who was blind and had been 
	alcoholic, Bobby Ray Peterson, decided to join the church. He was standing 
	with the minister after the service in which he became a member, as was the 
	custom, so congregants could file by and welcome him. I was in line behind 
	one of the deacons, who was white. When the deacon reached Bobby Ray, 
	instead of shaking his hand, he said to him angrily, “Why did you join this 
	church? You have your own churches over there! Why don’t you stay on your 
	own side of town?” </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A hushed silence came and went. The 
	minister said nothing. Others filed by and greeted Bobby Ray, who now looked 
	crushed and terrified. Later, I asked the minister if she was going to say 
	anything to the deacon about his comment. “What would I say?” she asked me.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Maybe that such racist comments are 
	offensive, and that he should apologize to Mr. Peterson,” I suggested. The 
	minister said that the deacon was entitled to his opinion, even if we 
	disagreed with him. Mr. Peterson never attended another service at UP.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am no longer Christian, or 
	religious, and I don’t consider myself liberal. Many I know, however, who 
	are liberal Christians today, express negative sentiments about 
	fundamentalists similar to those I heard at University Place Church years 
	ago. Liberals claim that fundamentalists and evangelicals distort 
	Christianity by focusing only on Jesus’ crucifixion, and on heaven and hell, 
	sinners and the saved. Many liberals claim, as I once did, that they believe 
	in and practice what they call “the social gospel,” which focuses on Jesus’ 
	love for the poor, and that this sharply divides them from fundamentalists. 
	But the longer I lived in Oklahoma, the more overlaps I saw between these 
	two seemingly separate versions of Christianity. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After five years, Phillips 
	Theological Seminary moved its center from Enid to Tulsa, and we moved with 
	it. As for fundamentalism, we left the town of Tabernacle Baptist for the 
	city of Oral Roberts University and Rhema Bible Institute, one of the 
	largest of numerous evangelical institutions there. Fundamentalism and 
	extreme conservatism were alive and well in that city of 400,000. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In a city of highways, with no 
	sidewalks and virtually no public transportation, every other car had some 
	visible homage to Jesus on it. If it wasn’t the ubiquitous fish symbol, it 
	was a bumper sticker. These slogans said things like, “Caution: When the 
	Rapture Comes, This Car Will Have No Driver,” “Got Jesus? It’s Hell Without 
	Him,” “Atheists are Beyond Belief,” “For All You Do—His Blood’s For You,” 
	and “God Says It—I Believe It—That Settles It,” (echoes of Sister Jones!). 
	Billboards along the highways exhibited crudely drawn, bloody images of 
	Jesus on the cross and called for sinners’ repentance, advertised numerous 
	fundamentalist megachurches and Christian groups, and inveighed against 
	abortion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At first, the bumper stickers and 
	even the billboards seemed benign to me. People have a right to believe as 
	they wish, I felt. Fundamentalism may have had caused the painful rift 
	between Roy and me, and our former friends at Tabernacle Baptist, but 
	otherwise, I and my family had no personal involvement with it, no reason to 
	view it as negative. After all, weren’t we free to believe and practice as 
	we wished? My own version of faith even caused me to continue to look for 
	aspects of belief I could share with these fellow Christians. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I continued to encounter people, 
	though, who agreed with Sister Jones’s assessment of me, that I somehow 
	represented evil. When, for example, I reported a co-worker in a childcare 
	center where I worked, because she threw a child against a shelf, she told 
	me she had seen right away on meeting me that I was of the devil. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I taught poetry as a 
	writer-in-residence in a class at an “alternative” high school (for students 
	with difficulties such as drug addiction), the teacher supported students in 
	their constant harassment of a girl they considered a Satan-worshipper. (She 
	wore long skirts, and earrings shaped like pentagrams, which fundamentalists 
	consider a symbol of the devil, I later learned, and she wrote in runic 
	script in her journal.) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During class, in the teacher’s 
	presence, students including some boys with shaved heads, who wore spiked 
	dog collars, metal-studded leather, and skull tattoos, taunted her every day 
	with statements such as “What are you writing, messages to Satan?” or “You 
	don’t like us? Why don’t you get your buddy Satan to beat us up?” The 
	teacher smiled at these taunts and said nothing. I asked the teacher what 
	she thought about the situation, and she said she felt the girl provoked the 
	treatment she received by the way she dressed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I once asked the girl what her 
	religious beliefs were. “I have my own religion,” she answered. “I take some 
	ideas from old Celtic beliefs, and some from Christianity. I’m studying this 
	ancient runic script that comes from Ireland,” she said, showing me her 
	journal. I asked her why the other students taunted her. “They make my life 
	miserable,” she answered. “They hate me because of how I dress. I’m going 
	crazy here, it’s just unbearable. They just think everyone is either 
	Christian or a Satan-worshipper. Those are the only categories they 
	understand,” she said. The teacher told me the girl had attempted suicide.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One day the teacher brought a copy 
	of People Magazine, the cover of which featured a photo of a popular singer 
	who had come out as a lesbian. She held up the magazine in front of the 
	class, and said in a disgusted tone, “This is what our culture is coming to, 
	boys and girls.” A chorus of hostile remarks and jeers rose from the class, 
	at which the teacher smiled. The students also ridiculed me, and the teacher 
	supported them in this as she did in their taunting of the girl, by smiling 
	and remaining silent. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Beyond these personal encounters, 
	right-wing politics merged with fundamentalist Christianity pervaded 
	everything. When I shopped at Tulsa’s only health food store, before the 
	Wild Oats chain found its way there, the voice of Rush Limbaugh blared from 
	the radio, and there were often petitions opposing abortion available for 
	signing. (Organics and health food, along with home schooling, were mainly 
	the province of the Christian right in Tulsa, since they provided refuge 
	from what adherents viewed as a fallen, secular society.) At WalMart, Newt 
	Gingrich played over the sound system. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A controversy at an elementary 
	school became public and was widely written about and discussed. A teacher 
	used a New-Age-oriented book, which included poems from Native American 
	culture about earth and wind spirits. Opponents viewed the book as Satanic, 
	and demanded that the teacher be fired. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A friend of ours, a musician, taught 
	at the right-wing Christian Oral Roberts University, or ORU, though she was 
	not a fundamentalist. She also taught piano lessons privately. When parents 
	of her students learned that she had moved in with her fiancé, they withdrew 
	their children from lessons and wrote letters of complaint about her to the 
	ORU newsletter, saying she shouldn’t be allowed to teach at the school 
	because she was “unChristian.” Needless to say, this hurt her career. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At my younger daughter Chloe’s 
	Suzuki violin group, several parents objected to the fiddle tune “Devil’s 
	Dream” because of its title, and to the theme song from Pocahontas, because 
	the Walt Disney company that made the movie employed gays. Not only would 
	these parents not allow their children to play the songs, they were also 
	vocal in their insistence that the teacher eliminate them from the group’s 
	repertoire. The teacher privately disagreed with them, but kept her feelings 
	to herself and acquiesced to their demands, to avoid a conflict. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Chloe wanted to attend a 
	Christian summer camp with one of her friends, I had to fill out a form 
	asking if I was saved, if Chloe was saved, and what we would like the camp 
	to pray for while Chloe was there. I wrote, “Pray that people’s right to 
	believe as they wish, or not to believe, will be respected, and that no one 
	will pressure my daughter or anyone in any way to accept religious beliefs 
	or practices.” </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">We Don’t Want Those People Here
	</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some who viewed me as suspicious or 
	even evil were fundamentalist; some were not. Roy and I began attending 
	Fellowship Congregational, the most liberal Protestant church in Tulsa. We 
	chose the church because we were still committed to our quest for a 
	class-diverse community, and the minister allowed us to organize a weekly 
	meeting with a meal similar to the one we were part of in Enid. Most of its 
	members were homeless men, and many were gay. These men told us of many 
	instances of discrimination they encountered. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">From time to time, they said, groups 
	of young people approached them in public parks, saying, “We’re asking you 
	to leave this park. This is a Christian park, and you’re not allowed here.” 
	An article about this in a local paper explained that ministers of 
	fundamentalist churches organized the groups as missionary projects for 
	youth. Two friends were severely beaten, under a bridge where they were 
	sleeping, by skinheads who called them “f—ing faggots” as they stamped on 
	their heads with their heavy, cleated boots. The attack was reported on, but 
	was not prosecuted as a hate crime. Tulsa was a center for gay people in 
	Oklahoma, and it held a yearly gay pride parade. Every year, protesters 
	would line the parade route, holding signs saying, “God Hates Fags,” “Sodomy 
	is a Sin,” “Burn in Hell, Sodomites,” “AIDS is Your Punishment from God,” 
	and other slogans of hate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The reception our friends received 
	at Fellowship was less warm even than that UP members gave the poor in Enid. 
	Everyone who wanted to helped prepare the food, set tables, and clean up. 
	Some Fellowship members provided some support, most notably by lending a van 
	we used to give people rides to the church. Other prominent members 
	complained, however, at the presence of “those people” in ”our” kitchen and 
	at church events. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally some prominent members met 
	with Roy and me. They told us the meals had to end. The men were bringing 
	down the quality of the church, they asserted. We protested, but they were 
	adamant. “We don’t want those people here,” they told us emphatically. When 
	we asked the minister about this, he supported them. I felt that, if they 
	didn’t want “those people” there, they didn’t want me either. In fact, this 
	event was one of the experiences that most strongly influenced my decision 
	ultimately to withdraw from Christianity, and religion, altogether. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Our last try at Christianity was 
	with a small Society of Friends—Quaker meeting. (Quakers often call their 
	communities “meetings” rather than “churches.”) In that community, a 
	controversy erupted when a group from the East Coast, called Friends of 
	African Descent, presented a complaint to the meetings of the 
	Oklahoma-Louisiana-Texas-Arkansas region. The African American Quakers said 
	they were offended that, when local meetings in the region met together 
	yearly, they played a capture-the-flag type of family game called “The 
	Underground Railroad Game.” Meeting members ran around outside, some 
	pretending to be slaves, some slave-catchers, and some abolitionists. The 
	African Americans considered the game racist, feeling it trivialized the 
	injustice and immense suffering slavery represented. “Would you play a game 
	called ‘The Holocaust Game’?” they asked. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In formal discussions of the African 
	Americans’ complaint, Roy and I supported them, and agreed that the regional 
	meeting should stop playing the game. Members of our local Tulsa meeting, 
	like the others in the region, wanted to continue with the game. The African 
	Americans’ complaint angered them, and they were furious with us for 
	supporting it. They felt we were unjustly accusing them of being racist. 
	They were so angry at us that they decided to formally eject us from their 
	meeting. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana">Fundamentalist Culture </font>
	</b></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These experiences with liberal 
	Christianity in a fundamentalist milieu radically altered my perceptions. 
	What I came to believe, by the end of our fifteen years in Oklahoma, was 
	that right-wing Christian fundamentalism promotes a culture that supports 
	extremism, hate and violence. We heard and saw many people in Tulsa express 
	their belief in the nearness of the rapture, or end-time, as had Dorothy and 
	Loren Jones, Tabernacle members, and most others in South Enid. This is the 
	belief that Jesus will return and God will lift him and the saved (ie. 
	fundamentalists and evangelicals) to heaven and throw all others into the 
	eternal fire of hell. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ironically, though African Americans 
	in Enid embraced all who espoused beliefs like their own, racism was closely 
	connected to the fundamentalist mindset. We heard on local radio stations, 
	and read articles, about the phenomenon called the Christian Identity 
	movement. The movement held that God long ago formed people of color, 
	especially African Americans, of different material than whites. Whites, 
	they believed, were formed of flesh, while Africans were formed of mud. This 
	meant, they believed, that God wanted white Christians to dominate all other 
	races. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Ku Klux Klan, who identify 
	themselves as Christian, were known to be active in Tulsa, and at least once 
	held a rally downtown. In fact, when we checked with the police station 
	about the crime rate in an area we were thinking of moving into, they told 
	us the Klan was the main problem in the neighborhood. The Ku Klux Klan 
	overlapped with the Christian Identity movement, and I believe that the 
	absolutist, dualistic exclusivity central to fundamentalism, which worships 
	a God who gave his son to be tortured and executed, and who throws 
	unbelievers into eternal torture, is of a piece with the absolute racial 
	divisions the Klan pursues. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I first heard of fundamentalism 
	in Oklahoma, I looked for commonalities among the different versions of 
	Christianity. Now that I’ve found them, I believe they are there, but they 
	are pernicious, not positive as I had assumed they would be. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have come to believe that, not 
	only does liberal Christianity fail to counteract fundamentalism, it ends up 
	playing into its problems, for two reasons. One is that it shares a 
	characteristic central to all brands of Christianity. Exclusivism—based on 
	important statements in the Bible, such as the one attributed to Jesus, that 
	“no man can come to the Father except through me,” and John 3:16, the verse 
	fundamentalists often repeat, &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his 
	one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have 
	eternal life”—is central in Christian doctrine. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The central Christian doctrine of 
	evangelism, based on these and many other passages, supports an assumption 
	almost all Christians share in one way or another, that the Christian group 
	with which they identify is superior to all other people and groups. 
	Fundamentalists and evangelicals simply believe non-believers are evil and 
	deserve God’s punishment. Even when particular liberal Christian 
	congregations eschew fundamentalist tenets such as a belief in the rapture, 
	the cultural climate pervasive fundamentalism creates makes exclusivism the 
	norm. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The more a culture is dominated by 
	fundamentalism, the less room there is in it for wide-ranging variances in 
	beliefs and points of view. Fundamentalism in inherently dualistic and 
	exclusive, and it exerts pressure on culture, including on other strains of 
	Christianity, to also emphasize exclusivism. Once fundamentalism sets up and 
	spreads an absolute dualism between saved and unsaved, it becomes difficult 
	for anyone not to see the world in terms of simple divisions, whether the 
	categories are saved/unsaved, open-minded/closed-minded, 
	fundamentalist/liberal, red/blue, rich/poor, or black/white. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The three liberal Christian churches 
	we were part of unquestioningly embraced the pervasive class- and race-based 
	exclusivism of the national culture in which they were embedded. Many other 
	liberal congregations across the nation struggle with whether to include gay 
	people, as members or as ministers. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The second reason liberal 
	Christianity does not make much of a dent is that even those who do maintain 
	and live out a commitment to inclusivism face an equal and opposite reaction 
	in a culture pervaded with fundamentalism. When an inclusive approach meets 
	an exclusive one, the inclusive approach cannot prevail. An inclusive person 
	or group cannot engage in dialogue with a group who believes the inclusive 
	people are evil. Inclusivism simply provides the exclusive with an opening 
	by which they can dominate those who are inclusive. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As Roy and I found out, the 
	exclusive group will inevitably judge the inclusive group negatively. The 
	exclusive group unifies around designating outsiders as evil, and so its 
	members feel justified, indeed righteous, in inflicting whatever punishment 
	they see fit on the outsiders. While believers in inclusivity are 
	celebrating the differences of those who practice exclusive religions, 
	exclusive religions are planning the ejection and ultimate demise of the 
	evil Others. The wider the perception of differences as evil and 
	threatening, the harsher and more brutal the society becomes. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Living in New York as I do now, I 
	feel as though I carry around secret knowledge of a ticking bomb, and that I 
	can’t figure out how to tell the people around me about it. Those who are 
	fundamentalist know about the bomb, but they support its detonation. In 
	their view, its detonation will mean a world converted to their brand of 
	Christianity, ultimately expressed in the rapture. In my view, it will mean 
	the explosion of our constitutional democracy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What I came to understand was that 
	Dorothy Jones’s defensiveness about the Bakkers was of a piece with her 
	hostility towards us, and her banishment of us, because of our questions 
	about the Bible. I came to understand that the conviction that it is evil to 
	question or criticize fellow fundamentalists is essential to fundamentalism. 
	The way fundamentalists recognize one another is not through discussions 
	about tenets of the faith, it is by attitude, language, and style of life 
	and worship. If a person prays right, says the right words about Jesus and 
	God, and has the right manner and voice, that’s all that matters. One does 
	not need to know the Bible, one does not need to obey the law. One does not 
	need to be honest, just, compassionate, kind, or even display common 
	decency. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I now understand that fundamentalist 
	belief trumps all other beliefs and values. It trumps customs, friendship 
	and reason. It trumps the United States Constitution and the laws of our 
	land. What it demands of its adherents is loyalty, and that is all. It 
	eschews differences, however subtle, in beliefs, interpretations, practice 
	and language people use to talk about their faith. As such, it is inherently 
	incompatible with democracy. In fact many fundamentalists openly express 
	contempt for democracy, advocating instead for a “Christian republic,” as at 
	http://groups.msn.com/TheChristianRepublic. Ironically, fundamentalism can 
	flourish in our nation because we support freedom of religion. 
	Fundamentalism takes advantage of this bedrock of our Constitution to 
	encourage contempt for the Constitution. Fundamentalism takes advantage of 
	those who believe in tolerance, to aggressively promote its agenda of 
	non-tolerance. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Non-tolerance is also a strong 
	strain in American culture, expressing itself in myriad ways. Exclusivist 
	feelings and assumptions make many Americans readily able to live with 
	fundamentalism, even if they don’t explicitly embrace it. Exclusivist 
	feelings and practices in those who explicitly repudiate fundamentalism, 
	such as liberal Christians, also make America fertile ground for the growth 
	of right-wing Christian fundamentalism. It is crucial that Americans first 
	learn about and face the realities of what the Christian fundamentalist 
	worldview entails, and then that we examine our hearts and minds, to locate 
	the exclusivism that resides in us and commit ourselves to letting it go. 
	Otherwise, fundamentalist extremism will continue to spread through our 
	culture and society at every level. This is not good news for our nation, 
	and, because of the influence we exert across the globe, it is not good news 
	for the world. </font></p>
