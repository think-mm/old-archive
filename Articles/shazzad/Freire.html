				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Over the last 30 
				years, the definitions of “development” and “participation” have 
				changed radically. In the 1960s “development” was viewed 
				primarily as a process of industrialisation and economic 
				expansion within the “Third World”. Rural development was 
				understood only in relation to agricultural development and was 
				largely perceived as an interim step on the way to urban 
				industrialisation.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">In the rural 
				context, the objective of initial development efforts was to 
				“modernise” the values of the peasants and to make them more 
				oriented to urbanisation and industrialisation. Most 
				unfortunately, rural poor were viewed as passive receivers of 
				development inputs. The solution to the problem of 
				underdevelopment, therefore, seemed simply to be providing them 
				with the right measures and prescriptions as considered suitable 
				by the development planners. But these one-way development 
				efforts which were in other words “top-down” did not really 
				work. This was because of the fact that the roles and needs of 
				the people who really needed the development were ignored and as 
				such this top-down development efforts did not have any effect 
				on the poor to be self-reliant. Virtually, the poor silently 
				considered these external development initiatives as foreign 
				bodies and with unwillingness, gradually became dependent on and 
				enchained by them.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Fortunately, the 
				reasons for such failures could be recognised and the importance 
				of involving people in all aspects of development 
				decision-making was also widely acknowledged. Development was 
				redefined as a process of “education” and “empowerment” which 
				devotes to strengthen and support the indigenous skills and 
				knowledge of rural people by supplementing or reinforcing the 
				existing wisdoms with the scientific knowledge, based on sharing 
				of learning. Development was also seen as a process which 
				involves increased access to resources (eg land, capital, 
				credit, institutions, knowledge and information) by rural 
				people.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">The invaluable 
				contribution to such a shift from top-down to bottom-up approach 
				was made among others by one of the renowned political 
				pedagogues named Paulo Freire of Brazil. In the 1960s and 1970s, 
				he initiated debates about the meaning of “participation” with a 
				growing body of theory and practice about grassroots 
				development. Freire devised radical learning programmes with 
				people living on the margins of the society. He introduced a 
				novel method of radical and liberal education to encourage poor 
				people to think critically about the reasons for their 
				under-development, oppression, exploitation and exclusion. 
				Freire put forward the notion of critical learning as a process 
				that could lead to social transformation.</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
				<p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Freire’s objections 
				to a top-down mode of learning in which marginalised and poor 
				people are treated as passive recipients of knowledge were 
				reflected in a move among development agencies in the 1970s and 
				1980s to devise methods of working with poor communities, which 
				would actively involve them in identifying and solving their own 
				problems. Rural people’s resilience and ability to survive in 
				harsh climatic, social and economic conditions was argued as a 
				case to reassess and respect local knowledge and expertise. Also 
				it was emphasised that the people should be the sole authority 
				to decide what kind of initiatives they really need for their 
				development and well-being. This implicit logic was based on the 
				fact that both societies and individuals have innate biological, 
				psychological and sociological capacities which can be utilised 
				by themselves to analyse their own reality and needs and to take 
				necessary measures for socio-economic development. For doing 
				this the development practitioners definitely have roles to 
				play, but not as deciders, rather as facilitators – to put them 
				through the process of “conscientisation”. Let’s see how Paulo 
				Freire developed his theory and practice for giving a new 
				dimension to the realm of education and development.</span></font></p>

				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Paulo Freire was 
				born in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil on September 19, 1921. He 
				died on May 2, 1997 of heart attack. Freire’s catholic family 
				was not very rich with his father doing the job of a petty 
				officer in the military service. Although not well-off, his 
				father had great interest in his children’s education, which 
				practically paved the way for Freire to go for schooling.</span></font></p>

				<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Due to financial 
				problems caused by the economic depression in 1929 and onwards, 
				Freire’s family was forced to leave Recife, settling in nearby 
				Jaboatao where Paulo spent part of his childhood and 
				adolescence. In Jaboatao, he began to be aware of the world 
				around him and that all was not well, since many of his friends 
				lived in extreme poverty. He described himself as a “connective 
				boy” because, among his day to day companions, were some who ate 
				less and some who hardly ever ate. He said, “In Jaboatao, when I 
				was ten, I began to think that there were a lot of things in the 
				world that were not going well.” During this time Freire found 
				himself among the ‘wretched of the earth’. This gnawing pang of 
				hunger had profound influence on his young life, and just at 
				that time he made a vow to dedicate his life for the struggle 
				against poverty. Perhaps this was the beginning for Freire to 
				perceive that ‘reality of life has some link with politics’. To 
				share his feeling he mentioned that this firsthand struggle 
				brought forth a fundamental change in his life and thus the 
				horizon of his world expanded further.</span></font></p>

				<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: windowtext">Freire returned to 
				Recife to attend high school a couple of years later. His mother 
				managed to convince the director of the Oswaldo Cruz private 
				high school to accept Paulo as a scholarship student. Later, he 
				returned to the school as a teacher of Portuguese. As a student 
				Freire was full of potential. All aspects of life he learnt to 
				view critically. Nothing was ‘as simple as anything’ to him. 
				Many a time he attempted to uncover the problems of life, and 
				for this his parents had to receive the ironic comment from his 
				teacher that he had ‘mild mental retardation’. But this 
				evaluation was later proved to be starkly immaterial as he 
				smoothly grew up as a pleader, a profession he never liked for 
				himself though. In fact from a very early age he already had 
				developed a great passion in social reform and the rights of the 
				minorities. As a result this indomitable desire led him to brush 
				aside law as a career and to become an educationist.</span></font></p>

				<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: windowtext">He began his 
				education in a law school at the University of Recife in 1943. 
				In 1944 he married Elza Maia Costa Oliveira, a primary school 
				teacher. He began to practice law but stoped before defending 
				his first client, a young dentist. Freire observed, “I said to 
				Elza: “You know what, I’m not going to be a lawyer.” Elza said, 
				“I was hoping for that. You’re an educator.” </span></font></p>

				got married I began to be interested in the problems of 
				education in a systematic way,” said Freire. From 1940 to 1950,

				taking voluminous notes, to understand the problems of life and 
				their links with education.</span></font></p>

				discrimination. By the same token, I could never reconcile the

				of our tasks as progressive educators, today and yesterday, is 
				to use the past that influences the present. The past was not 
				only a time of authoritarianism and imposed silence, but also a 
				time that generated a culture of resistance as an answer to the 
				violence of power.”</span></font></p>

				thesis, “Education and Present-Day Brazil,” which I defended in

				In 1957, Freire was appointed Director of SESI’s Pernambuco 
				Regional Chapter’s Division of Research and Planning and began 
				to travel widely throughout the Northeast as a consultant to 
				other SESI programmes. He was also one of the founders of the 
				Capibaribe Institute in Recife which remains a (private) school 
				well-known for its commitment to a high-level scientific, 
				ethical and moral education and democratic stance. He also sat 
				on Recife’s Educational Consulting Board. In 1959, his thesis 
				was accepted and he was appointed Professor of the History and 
				Philosophy of Education at the School of Fine Arts. In 1961, he 
				was made Director of the Division of Culture and Recreation of 
				the City of Recife’s Department of Archives and Culture. In 
				1963, he became one of fifteen “Pioneer Council Members” chosen

				the chief writer and creator of the ideas contained in Theme III 
				of the Pernambuco Regional Commission’s report to the Second 
				National Conference on Adult Education, in Rio de Janeiro in 
				1958. Entitled the “Education of Adults and Marginal 
				Populations: the Mocambos Problem,” the paper proposed that 
				adult education in the Pernambuco Mocambos had to have its 
				foundation in the consciousness of the day-to-day situations 
				lived by the learners; educational work towards democracy would 
				only be achieved if the literacy process was not about or for 
				man, but with man. This attitude heralded that a more 
				progressive segment of Brazilian society was ready to break with 
				the archaic, authoritarian, discriminatory, elitist traditions 
				which had for centuries enslaved the Brazilian poor.</span></font></p>

				<span lang="EN-GB" style="color: windowtext">Apart from his 
				academic and institutional life, Freire participated in 
				movements for popular education in the early 1960s. The most 
				important of these were the Movement for Popular Culture (MCP) 
				in Recife, the Cultural Extension Service (SEC) at the 
				University of Recife (now the Federal University of Pernambuco: 
				UFPE) and the “Bare Feet Can Also Learn to Read” campaign in the 
				neighbouring state of Rio Grande do Norte where Freire got his 
				first chance to try out his method with three hundred sugarcane 
				sharecroppers in the interior village of Angicos in 1963. When 
				that experiment proved successful, he was invited by President 
				Joao Belchior Goulart to implement a national literacy campaign. 
				The programme was intended to make five million adults literate 
				and politically progressive within the first year. According to 
				the national law at the time, adults could only vote if they 
				were functionally literate to some degree. For years this 
				limiting of the Brazilian electoral college had worked in favour 
				of the hegemonic oligarchy. Now the landowners were threatened 
				by the possibility that the peasants would organise into 
				leagues, become literate and swell the ranks of the voters. The 
				American backed coup of March 31, 1964 deposed the popular 
				Goulart government and imposed military rule which lasted for 
				over twenty years. Freire was arrested twice and imprisoned in 
				Olinda and Recife for over two months before receiving political 
				asylum in the Bolivian embassy in Rio and proceeding to La Paz 
				where he found the altitude and uncertain politics contrary to 
				his health and left for Santiago, Chile within a month.</span></font></p>

				for two organisations having to do with agricultural improvement 
				and land reform, Cambridge, Massachusetts (1969-70) where he 
				taught for ten months at Harvard and Geneva, Switzerland 
				(1970-79) where he worked and travelled under the auspices of 
				the World Council of Churches as a kind of roving ambassador of 
				literacy to the Third World. In this capacity, he travelled the

				actively involved in politics with Workers’ Party of Brazil.

				model revolves around certain basic principles. These include 
				subject to subject relation among human beings, democratisation

				humanity, dialogical praxis and contextualisation of educational

				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">It goes without 
				saying that Freirean education model has immense potential for 
				spreading non-formal (also formal) education in Bangladesh. 
				Freire viewed literacy and continuing education as a means for 
				democratisation of culture among the rural and urban 
				non-literate people. This undoubtedly has profound implications 
				for sustainable democracy in Bangladesh against the backdrop 
				that over 70 million people are non-literate (not illiterate) 
				and the government is determined to eradicate illiteracy through 
				popular education movement. If the popular education model of 
				Paulo Freire is adopted and adapted in the literacy campaign, 
				the future literate people of the country will develop capacity 
				for critical thought to work democratically within popular 
				organisations. More importantly, practice of three ethical 
				values in the education arena, viz. freedom and human rights, 
				critical dialogue (not polemics), and respect for creativity can 
				make up a democratic culture in the organisations that are 
				promoting and want to promote non-formal participatory education 
				in Bangladesh. In this regard, both government and NGOs can do 
				in-depth study on Paulo Freire’s life and work, and 
				contextualise his education model for Bangladesh situation. For 
				experience sharing they can even take support from those 
				implementing Freire’s education theories and model for their 
				literacy and sustainable development programme. Organisations 
				having adopted Freirean approach in Bangladesh so far are: BRAC, 
				FIVDB, Proshika, ActionAid’s REFLECT, CARE, etc.</span></font></p>

				<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">As a political 
				pedagogue, Paulo Freire was the main proponent of liberation 
				theory. He basically took humanistic and liberating approach to 
				the questions of development. The underlying assumption was that 
				the members of the underdeveloped societies are oppressed by the 
				power-holders of their own societies, who control the relevant 
				economic resources such as agriculture, land, industry, capital, 
				service and wealth. Freire argued that the main remedy for 
				overcoming this oppression lies in the education of the 
				oppressed to be aware of their condition and position through 
				critical learning and taking pragmatic actions. His theoretical 
				focus tends to be on the role of education in the liberation and 
				development process. “Indeed, for Freire, liberation <i>is</i> 
				development, and for those espousing the liberation approach, 
				development is more a question of justice rather than wealth” 
				(Curle, 1973).</span></font></p>

				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Although Freire is 
				no more with us he is still an inspiration to the practitioners 
				and academics world-wide, not only those involved in literacy, 
				but also those working with wider education, community work, 
				development work, cultural movement and even with politics. He 
				is adored because all through his life he lived with those 
				realities existing with the oppressed class. He preached for a 
				‘subject to subject relationship’ so that the oppressed could 
				break the culture of silence renouncing the oppressors’ 
				worldview and establish their own worldview from their own 
				perceptive, for a democratic culture for all people living free. 
				He inspired to generate firm hope which is indispensable for 
				acquiring democratic culture, liberating education and for 
				social change: “Without hope there is little we can do. Without 
				a minimum of hope, we cannot so much as start the struggle. To 
				attempt to do without hope, which is based on the need for truth 
				as an ethical quality of the struggle, is tantamount to denying 
				that struggle one of its mainstays.”</span></font></p>

				<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt">Freire talked about 
				feeling of love, hope and attachment for liberation and 
				humanisation. He pointed out that love is instrumental in 
				humanising the self and humanising the world which could be 
				achieved through a participatory, modest and empowering learning 
				process. This articulation of Freire was, is and will continue 
				to be a source of inspiration to human being across the world.</span></font></p>
