      <!-- #BeginEditable "Body" --><i>This is an edited extract from the 2004 
      Sydney Peace Prize lecture delivered by Arundhati Roy at the Seymour 
      Center last night.</i><p>Sometimes there's truth in old cliches. There can 
      be no real peace without justice. And without resistance there will be no 
      justice. Today, it is not merely justice itself, but the idea of justice 
      that is under attack.</p>
      <p>The assault on vulnerable, fragile sections of society is so complete, 
      so cruel and so clever that its sheer audacity has eroded our definition 
      of justice. It has forced us to lower our sights, and curtail our 
      expectations. Even among the well-intentioned, the magnificent concept of 
      justice is gradually being substituted with the reduced, far more fragile 
      discourse of &quot;human rights&quot;.</p>
      <p>This is an alarming shift. The difference is that notions of equality, 
      of parity, have been pried loose and eased out of the equation. It's a 
      process of attrition. Almost unconsciously, we begin to think of justice 
      for the rich and human rights for the poor. Justice for the corporate 
      world, human rights for its victims. Justice for Americans, human rights 
      for Afghans and Iraqis. Justice for the Indian upper castes, human rights 
      for Dalits and Adivasis (if that.) Justice for white Australians, human 
      rights for Aborigines and immigrants (most times, not even that.)</p>
      <div class="islandad" id="adSpotIsland">
&nbsp;</div>
      <p>It is becoming more than clear that violating human rights is an 
      inherent and necessary part of the process of implementing a coercive and 
      unjust political and economic structure on the world. Increasingly, human 
      rights violations are being portrayed as the unfortunate, almost 
      accidental, fallout of an otherwise acceptable political and economic 
      system. As though they are a small problem that can be mopped up with a 
      little extra attention from some non-government organisation.</p>
      <p>This is why in areas of heightened conflict - in Kashmir and in Iraq 
      for example - human rights professionals are regarded with a degree of 
      suspicion. Many resistance movements in poor countries which are fighting 
      huge injustice and questioning the underlying principles of what 
      constitutes &quot;liberation&quot; and &quot;development&quot; view human rights 
      non-government organisations as modern-day missionaries who have come to 
      take the ugly edge off imperialism - to defuse political anger and to 
      maintain the status quo.</p>
      <p>It has been only a few weeks since Australia re-elected John Howard, 
      who, among other things, led the nation to participate in the illegal 
      invasion and occupation of Iraq.</p>
      <p>That invasion will surely go down in history as one of the most 
      cowardly wars ever. It was a war in which a band of rich nations, armed 
      with enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world several times over, 
      rounded on a poor nation, falsely accused it of having nuclear weapons, 
      used the United Nations to force it to disarm, then invaded it, occupied 
      it and are now in the process of selling it.</p>
      <p>I speak of Iraq, not because everybody is talking about it, but because 
      it is a sign of things to come. Iraq marks the beginning of a new cycle. 
      It offers us an opportunity to watch the corporate-military cabal that has 
      come to be known as &quot;empire&quot; at work. In the new Iraq, the gloves are off.</p>
      <p>As the battle to control the world's resources intensifies, economic 
      colonialism through formal military aggression is staging a comeback. Iraq 
      is the logical culmination of the process of corporate globalisation in 
      which neo-colonialism and neo-liberalism have fused. If we can find it in 
      ourselves to peep behind the curtain of blood, we would glimpse the 
      pitiless transactions taking place backstage.</p>
      <p>Invaded and occupied Iraq has been made to pay out $US200 million ($270 
      million) in &quot;reparations&quot; for lost profits to corporations such as 
      Halliburton, Shell, Mobil, Nestle, Pepsi, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Toys 
      R Us. That's apart from its $US125 billion sovereign debt forcing it to 
      turn to the IMF, waiting in the wings like the angel of death, with its 
      structural adjustment program. (Though in Iraq there don't seem to be many 
      structures left to adjust.)</p>
      <p>So what does peace mean in this savage, corporatised, militarised 
      world? What does peace mean to people in occupied Iraq, Palestine, 
      Kashmir, Tibet and Chechnya? Or to the Aboriginal people of Australia? Or 
      the Kurds in Turkey? Or the Dalits and Adivasis of India? What does peace 
      mean to non-Muslims in Islamic countries, or to women in Iran, Saudi 
      Arabia and Afghanistan? What does it mean to the millions who are being 
      uprooted from their lands by dams and development projects? What does 
      peace mean to the poor who are being actively robbed of their resources? 
      For them, peace is war.</p>
      <p>We know very well who benefits from war in the age of empire. But we 
      must also ask ourselves honestly who benefits from peace in the age of 
      empire? War mongering is criminal. But talking of peace without talking of 
      justice could easily become advocacy for a kind of capitulation. And 
      talking of justice without unmasking the institutions and the systems that 
      perpetrate injustice is beyond hypocritical.</p>
      <p>It's easy to blame the poor for being poor. It's easy to believe that 
      the world is being caught up in an escalating spiral of terrorism and war. 
      That's what allows George Bush to say, &quot;You're either with us or with the 
      terrorists.&quot; But that's a spurious choice. Terrorism is only the 
      privatisation of war. Terrorists are the free marketeers of war. They 
      believe that the legitimate use of violence is not the sole prerogative of 
      the state.</p>
      <p>It is mendacious to make moral distinction between the unspeakable 
      brutality of terrorism and the indiscriminate carnage of war and 
      occupation. Both kinds of violence are unacceptable. We cannot support one 
      and condemn the other.</p>
