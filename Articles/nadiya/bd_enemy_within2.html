  <div>
    <div id="ftn4">
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">What Bangladesh has begun to realize, alongside
      other South Asian nations, is that in the era of globalization,
      Bangladesh, as well as the other countries in the region, cannot progress
      much further on their own. The establishment of trading blocs throughout
      the globe is a signal that to remain competitive in terms of international
      trade, South Asia needs to counter the segmentation of the global market
      with a regional grouping of its own.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">The South Asian Association for Regional
      Cooperation (SAARC) seemed to be the appropriate platform from which to
      launch the bid for regional cooperation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bangladesh, in
      the person of the late President Ziaur Rahman played a major role in the
      establishment of SAARC.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, established in
      1985, disappointingly enough, SAARC has under performed in terms of
      producing specific outcomes for regional growth.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Regional economic cooperation was a fairly late
      element in SAARC; the issues of trade, investment, finance, etc were
      deliberately left out of SAARC’s purview to avoid possible areas of
      conflict. Initiated in 1993, the South Asian Preferential Trading
      Agreement (SAPTA) was enforced only in 1995. The success of other regional
      economic entities brought forth the realisation that it was not possible
      to achieve the envisaged development without going into the contentious
      issue of regionalism in terms of economics. However, with most of the
      countries of this region entering the World Trade Agreement (WTO)<a title name="_ftnref1" href="#[1]"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[1]</span></a>
      – Bangladesh being among the first to join WTO – the first step
      towards economic integration has already been taken.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Following the success of a number of sub-regional
      economic zones involving the South East Asian nations<a title name="_ftnref2" href="#[2]"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>,
      especially the members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN),
      the establishment of a Free Trade Area in South Asia was conceptualized in
      the latter part of the 1990s. The South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) is
      scheduled to go into enforcement in 2001.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was
      supposed that the pace of regional cooperation would be accelerated by the
      establishment of the South Asian Growth Quadrangle (SAGQ) – an envisaged
      growth zone covering Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and several North Eastern
      Provinces of India.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">However, the creation of sub-regional alliances was
      not a measure wholeheartedly accepted by all South Asian nations.<span>&nbsp;
      </span>Non-participating member countries have voiced strong concerns over
      the necessity for such measures.<span>&nbsp; </span>The argument has been
      that the creation of other multilateral economic associations while SAARC
      exists is merely a waste of time and resources.<span>&nbsp; </span>In
      addition, the very existence of such entities may undermine the concept of
      SAARC, as <i>sub-</i>regional cooperation will damage the very concept of <i>regional
      cooperation</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Acceptance of the concept of sub
      regional growth zones has not been smooth within the participating
      countries either. In fact, the idea has given rise to serious debate and
      controversy in Bangladesh, fueling the ever-present fear of Indian
      expansionism. Consequently, sub-regionalism has not evolved into economic
      interaction across the board but has been limited to “specific projects
      relevant to the special individual needs of three or more Member States”<a title name="_ftnref3" href="#[3]"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">One reason that South Asia is not succeeding in
      coalescing as a region may be that India could not be matched by the other
      member countries economically, politically or even geographically. The
      enormous influence that India has in the region makes the smaller
      countries fear of being overwhelmed by India (anti-Indian rhetoric is one
      of the main strategies that one of the major political parties in
      Bangladesh uses to garner public sympathy) – and not only in terms of
      trade.<span>&nbsp; </span>The nations smaller in terms of size and wealth
      fear that any gains will be asymmetrically distributed, falling in favor
      of India.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">However, even the sternest critics of SAARC have to
      admit that the association has had a moderating influence on the region.<span>&nbsp;
      </span>It has succeeded in acting as a platform for the highest level
      political interaction between nations – in a region where face to face
      interaction between heads of state is hardly the norm.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
      difficult relationship between India and Pakistan, the two largest nations
      in South Asia, has always had a negative impact on the other countries of
      the region. The SAARC dialogues allow these countries to interact
      peacefully with each other without loss of face thereby opening the way
      towards further understanding.<span>&nbsp; </span>SAARC has shown the
      potential to act as a forum for dialogue, negotiations and peace building
      – aspects of the organisation that need to be tapped further.<span>&nbsp;
      </span>It has to be remembered that the effectiveness of such an
      association is always dependent on the geo-political reality of the
      region.<span>&nbsp; </span>As in any association, SAARC can only be as
      successful as its member countries want it to be – or will allow it to
      be.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The process of the SAARC ‘talk-shows’ – where
      the heads of states as well as ministers meet for face to face dialogue
      – needs to be made independent of anything that may be happening in the
      member countries. In the past, summit meets have been adjourned as a
      result of conflicts within or between member countries.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead
      of allowing the postponement of such meetings, it should be ensured that
      they be used as the chance to resolve national differences.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Non-governmental initiatives seem to be
      increasingly effective in a number of areas. Despite certain misgivings
      regarding sustainability, the unique role that NGOs have played in
      Bangladesh is a case in point. In other countries, civil society groups
      including NGOs are taking on substantial amounts of state obligations –
      with or without the support of the state.<span>&nbsp; </span>Within South
      Asia, social movements to further human and civil rights and social
      justice have been initiated.<span>&nbsp; </span>The same can be done to
      further the cause of regional cooperation – within and across national
      boundaries.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">The increase in popular support for religious
      fundamentalist political parties in Bangladesh (as well as in Pakistan and
      India) may be considered to be indicative of the people’s frustration
      with the mainstream political parties and their failure to resolve any of
      the national or regional problems.<span>&nbsp; </span>In a country beset
      by illiteracy and acute poverty, the inclination to try for a “divine”
      answer to all that troubles the region is perhaps natural.<span>&nbsp; </span>It
      is up to the ‘privileged’ few – privileged in terms of education as
      well as wealth – among the masses to identify and lead the way towards a
      better tomorrow.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The root of many of Bangladesh’s problems today lie
      in the past.<span>&nbsp; </span>The relationships between Bangladesh and
      its neighbours are to a large extent defined by their histories together;
      and an inability to overcome that past. Keeping past enmities alive by
      focussing on the “menace” – whether real or imagined – that India
      and Pakistan constitute is a strategy used by almost all politicians to
      occupy the minds of the people, which might otherwise begin to dwell on
      the increasingly worsening domestic situation.<span>&nbsp; </span>However,
      in an age when instant access to information is a reality, how much longer
      the politicians continue to try to “fool all of the people all of the
      time” is a point to be pondered.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Throughout its short history, the political
      parties of Bangladesh have failed miserably in cooperating and
      collaborating with each other – a practice that has ultimately resulted
      in compromising the economic future of the country.<span>&nbsp; </span>Progress
      in any sector of the country is slowed down or halted because of political
      unrest and corruption.<span>&nbsp; </span>The steadily declining law and
      order situation may be perceived as a byproduct of political corruption.<span>&nbsp;
      </span>Attempts at reform rarely succeed because of the interference of
      the political element in every aspect of society.<span>&nbsp; </span>What
      is frightening is that corruption, in the form of kickbacks, informal
      payments and threats of “persuasion”, has become the norm.<span>&nbsp;
      </span>Politically powerful persons remain “untouchable” without the
      threat of prosecution or punishment despite allegations of corruption.<span>&nbsp;
      </span>The present situation is one where a corrupt political system is
      breeding corruption into every aspect of society.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">&nbsp;<O>
      </O>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">With the fall of the dictatorship in 1990,
      Bangladesh entered a new era when the implementation of democracy had the
      chance to be more than just a dream.<span>&nbsp; </span>A decade later,
      for the first time in the history of Bangladesh, a government has
      succeeded in completing its term of office.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
      present, after a peaceful hand over of power to a caretaker government,
      the country is awaiting elections in October.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bangladesh
      has now reached a point in its existence when perhaps it is time to
      explore a different way – a way that will enable us to perceive
      ourselves not as a people forever separated by political beliefs, destined
      to tread upon the well-worn paths of political dissension and disharmony,
      but as a united people who can only help each other to move forward to a
      future of growth and prosperity.</p>
