  <p align="center"><font color="maroon" size="3"><strong><a href="index.html">Shabnam

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">Most of the people I have spoken to in
  Bangladesh express their anger at the American attack on Afghanistan
  vehemently. To the extent that some of them will say that people like Bin
  Laden are perhaps the only answer to American arrogance and callousness. Yet
  when I ask them how they feel about the muslims who died on September 11 and
  how they feel about the deaths of the Bangladeshis working in the World Trade
  Centre – because there were many who died that day – and how they
  rationalize those deaths, they fall silent. And when, after asking this
  question, I ask them again, do they really support what Laden and the Taliban
  stand for, they become unsure how to respond.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">The US, with its long and abysmal track
  record of pet dictators and fundamentalist groups it has taken under its wing
  to further its own economic and political spheres of influence will not get a
  lot of sympathy anywhere in the developing world. Add to this, the Western
  world’s famous fear of the Islamic bugaboo further whipped up by a Western
  media initially throwing the concept of responsible journalism to the winds
  (i.e. the now famous repetitive broadcast of a few Palestinians celebrating
  the attack on America), and the US government’s initial attitude of
  &quot;line ‘em up for lynchin’, pardner!&quot; – and you have a very
  potent mixture. Resulting in innocent people in the US being harassed (and
  even killed) and a virulent anti-Americanism spreading everywhere.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">In the face of all this, it is perhaps
  natural for muslims everywhere – including Bangladeshi muslims – to need
  to feel a sense of solidarity among themselves, to want to present to
  &quot;them&quot; a common front united under the banner of a common faith. Yet
  does that and – more to the point – <i>should</i> that solidarity extend
  to including the Taliban regime?</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">It is important for the muslim community at
  this point to make a very important distinction – that it is the Afghan
  people who can be considered as fellow muslims, a people who are <i>not</i>
  represented by the Taliban. <strong>The Taliban came to power through force,
  not popular mandate. </strong>And the people who are suffering most under the
  Taliban regime are the Afghanis themselves. America has come under attack of
  the Bin Laden/Taliban brand of Islam on September 11, 2001; Afghanistan has
  been under Taliban attack since 1996.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3"><strong>The people of Afghanistan are faring
  badly under the Taliban regime, but the worst off are the women. </strong>Every
  amenity that a society has to offer its inhabitants is denied them. Schools
  have been shut down; the next generation of Afghan women will only have
  distant memories of a remote past where even &quot;lowly&quot; women were
  allowed to be educated. Women have no access to healthcare; having a male
  doctor examine a female patient would be &quot;indecent&quot;, and since even
  professionally trained women are not allowed to work, the possibilities of a
  woman being able to get to a qualified physician is effectively nil. Even girl
  children (as young as four or five) at death’s door are being turned away by
  hospitals because they are female and there are no female doctors available to
  treat them. Women are not allowed to work; if a woman is not fortunate enough
  to have a man in her family to provide for her (and in a country ravaged by
  conflict for decades now, there are without doubt a large number of families
  without able-bodied men), she must starve or beg. But for women it is safer
  not to go out in public unless accompanied by a male family member. Women can
  be and have been stoned to death for the slightest infraction of the purdah.
  Windows of houses with women have to be painted over or totally covered so
  that even the shadow of a woman cannot be seen from outside.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">Information is hard to come by, but what
  meagre information does come out of that god-forsaken country shows us a
  regime that is effectively murdering its female population. Intense depression
  is widespread among women and while there are no accurate estimates, suicide
  rates among the female population have risen frighteningly. We are allowed
  terrifying glimpses of the women of a whole nation slowly being driven to
  either insanity or death.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3"><strong>The question demands to be asked: Is
  the Taliban way the true way of Islam? </strong>Is the depraved destruction
  that the Taliban is carrying out on Afghani women what Islamic societies are
  supposed to do to their women? These women are human beings……and they are
  muslims. While there is so much talk of the muslim Ummah and solidarity and
  fellowship, let us not forget that. Incidentally, let us also not forget that
  the Taliban regime is a major player in both the regional and the global
  illicit drug trade.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3"><strong>No morally sane person can
  truthfully say that the American attacks on Afghanistan are <u>defensible </u>or
  <u>justified</u> </strong>(except perhaps the American government and its
  allies). <font color="red"><strong>But can any morally sane person defend the
  Taliban regime?</strong></font> Why, then, are the muslims throughout the
  world not condemning the Taliban as strongly and as vocally as they are
  condemning the US? Is this what muslim solidarity is all about – supporting
  the unsupportable, defending the indefensible? Is this what the Muslim ummah
  stands for – that crimes committed by non-muslims should receive loud
  condemnation while muslim perpetrators, no matter how inhuman or how terrible
  their crimes, must be embraced? From where does this concept emanate from that
  because the Taliban speak so persistently and so noisily about Islam that they
  are more Islamic than the common Afghani or that anti-Talibanism is equal to
  anti-Islamism?</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">I read in the papers that US government has
  stated that it is &quot;perverse&quot; to focus on civilian casualties as
  there are many &quot;terrorists&quot; among those that are being killed in
  Afghanistan. Although they have no official state department form which to
  issue memos from, the majority of muslims appear to have come to the
  conclusion (probably by applying the same type of moral logic used by the US
  government) that it would be &quot;perverse&quot; to dwell on the failings of
  the Taliban, or to dwell on the fact that the people who suffered under the
  Taliban regime are also part of the greater muslim community as well. Today
  the muslim world weeps for muslim brothers and sisters being killed in
  Afghanistan, where were their tears when their brothers and sisters were being
  tortured and killed by the Taliban? Muslim hearts break as they watch images
  of starving Afghani children scrabble for food, why was that tenderness absent
  in their hearts when these children suffered the ravages of famine under the
  rule of a &quot;muslim&quot; government? Both the US government and the muslim
  community seem to share a common policy of ignoring or glossing over
  unpalatable facts.</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3">Is the Taliban then the people that the
  majority of muslims here can identify with? There are many who will say that
  the majority of muslims are peace loving people and do not support the
  Taliban. That protest against the American attacks on Afghanistan is meant not
  in support of the Taliban regime or of Bin Laden but in support of the
  defenseless, already half destroyed Afghani people. Perhaps that is true. But
  how will the world know that unless that distinction is made loud and clear
  for all to hear? If it is the common people of Afghanistan that muslim hearts
  go out to – people who are living between the oppression of the Taliban and
  the assault of America – then by all means condemn the attacks on
  Afghanistan. <font color="red"><strong>But let the support of the muslim world
  be given to organizations (like RAWA) and people who are working in the face
  of immense and immediate danger for the common Afghani, not to the Taliban.</strong></font></font></p>
