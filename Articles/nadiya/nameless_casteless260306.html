		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The man got off the evening 
		train. For the first time that winter he was wearing a coarse tweed 
		coat. The fox colour of the coat went quite well with the dirty bronze 
		colour of his skin. He was sporting an old but expensive tie, knotted 
		carelessly. His trousers had faded and, near his thigh, a tear had been 
		repaired hastily with a few large stitches. He had not taken the morning 
		train, but the evening one. The afternoon was fading fast. The man cast 
		a brief glance towards the southern edge of the platform where the 
		shadows were gradually lengthening with the descending evening darkness. 
		The reddish evening light was slowly fading from the rooftops of the big 
		houses and the tall trees of the east.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The man stared straight ahead at 
		the dusty road leading westward from the station. The tar on the road 
		had become worn out in places and its whole length was covered with 
		white dust. On both sides of it stood empty warehouses made of 
		corrugated iron. Dark alleys turned off from the sides of these enormous 
		warehouses. As far as he could see, there were no people on the broad 
		road.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The engines hissed as they 
		moved. Were the engines moving around by themselves in this solitary 
		place? It seemed as if none of them was busy or had any destination. The 
		low-roofed houses on the east side of the railway station were slowly 
		being swallowed up by the darkness-only the brick-coloured chimneys 
		could be seen vaguely.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He came out past the station 
		gate, carelessly swinging the leather folio bag he held in his hand. He 
		hadn't seen anyone on the platform or nearby, but when he was coming out 
		he saw some soldiers jammed into a small room by the gate. They were 
		chatting with their rifles resting on their knees, their caps lowered. 
		They looked at him with ice-cold eyes, but said nothing. They kept on 
		talking among themselves in low, harsh voices. A soldier raised his 
		rifle as the man passed the gate with his long strides.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;No, no, not now,&quot; said the 
		soldier next to him and reached out and lowered the muzzle of the rifle. 
		The soldier who had raised the rifle laughed like a fool, showing his 
		big teeth.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The man passed through the gate 
		and onto the road encircling a small, empty patch of dust-covered grass. 
		He kept on walking, his shoes sounding loud on the hard road. He 
		followed the road round the circle once. But he didn't see anyone. He 
		stood still and looked around him. There were several roads going in 
		different directions. Some were made of brick chips, covered with tar, 
		others were gravel roads, filled with dust. A few roads led towards the 
		city, the earthen road went towards the village. There were no houses on 
		either side-yet whitish, dilapidated houses could be seen quite clearly.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After going around the circle 
		outside the station once, his eyes fell on the corrugated iron 
		restaurant on the left. He entered it, realizing he was hungry. The room 
		was very cold inside, and the bulb shone dully in the haze of smoke. The 
		dirty chairs and tables in the room could barely be seen in the dim 
		light. He couldn't see any people at first. Then he saw the reddish 
		light of the restaurant stove and the manager sitting next to the door 
		with his chin resting on the table.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When the manager lifted his 
		eyes, the man stroked the golden bristle on his cheeks in an apologetic 
		manner and said, &quot;Can I have something to eat?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;There's nothing,&quot; the manager 
		replied in an irritated tone from behind the table.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&quot;No food at all?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;No, there's nothing,&quot; the 
		manager waved his hand in the manner of one brushing away flies.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The man ran his cracked 
		fingertips over the sloppy, different coloured stitching on the left 
		breast of the tweed coat and said, &quot;Can I get a cup of tea?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Nothing doing. Go on then, hit 
		the road.&quot; The manager stared at the man's retreating back as he left.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Outside he saw that deep 
		darkness had descended. There was no light on the road. He moved forward 
		along the large, broad road, his shoes raising the dust. As far as he 
		could remember, the road had never been this treeless. There used to be 
		a shop which painted signboards on the southern side of the road. A 
		homeopath used to sit there. Bright lights would blaze in the 
		evening-the doctor with the dried-up face would sit facing north. A few 
		old men would sit on the chairs and read the newspapers holding them 
		close to their noses. He tried to remember why he had come here. There 
		was some unfinished business. It seemed to him as if he owed someone 
		money or perhaps he was owed something by someone. Small memories 
		glinted inside his head, like fitful lightning in a stormy sky, such as 
		getting up in the morning and shaving or reading the papers. He had 
		cried when he had read that-Patrick Lumumba had been murdered. One 
		afternoon he had read poetry by Ho Chi Minh, &quot;The bells ring ding dong 
		at the foot of the mountains/ Robust young women come down from the 
		valley with small steps.&quot; In his childhood he had dug the earth with his 
		long fingers and found large potatoes-the seed potato in the middle had 
		rotted and dried up.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No one came from any direction. 
		He moved along the narrow, dark alley on the left by the storehouses. 
		His feet sometimes sank into the thick grass on both sides of the path. 
		He touched the corrugated iron wall of the storehouse and found it wet 
		with dew and extremely cold. He soon reached the river bank. He could 
		recognize the place now. The shops were lined up on either side of the 
		road.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He saw that all the shops were 
		closed. The cemented river bank itself was the road, with shops on both 
		sides. None of the shops on the riverside had earth underneath. The 
		river had eaten through so that all the huts on that side hung in space 
		on thick bamboo or wooden plinths. Twice he pricked up his ears and 
		listened to the slapping of water in the darkness. The river seemed to 
		be genuflecting at his feet. He could see the river still when he looked 
		to the left through the shops-flowing, dark and enormous. Thick fog had 
		settled on the river and only the scattered lights revealed the presence 
		of boats on the water.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Someone had paved this road with 
		black stones for fear of the river. The stones had become uneven now. In 
		some places they had disappeared. He stumbled suddenly. But it didn't 
		upset him. He was only surprised. No one was coming towards him or 
		speaking to him. There were no lights burning anywhere. The large doors 
		of the houses on both sides were closed tight. Someone somewhere had 
		fainted, their jaws clenched in fear. Some iron should be placed between 
		their jaws to separate them, he thought. Through immense curiosity, he 
		left the road and, climbing onto a low veranda, tried to peek through a 
		closed door. He could see nothing. He couldn't open the door even a 
		slit, after trying with all his might to pull the doors apart with his 
		hands. The strong odour of hot spice assailed his nose. He would return. 
		In the darkness he tripped on a black goat and scrambled back to the 
		road. The concrete road made a terrible sound.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then, for the first time, he 
		heard the tread of heavy boots. They shattered the silent darkness. Then 
		a shout rang out, &quot;Who's there?&quot; Almost simultaneously, a rifle cracked. 
		He stood awhile and listened. The sound of boots receded. Again a rifle 
		cracked. He tucked his folio bag under his arm and started walking 
		carefully, creeping like a centipede through the lines of closed shops, 
		along the empty, vacant road, past the countless alleys and side 
		streets, which kept on winding through the darkness like a labyrinth, 
		one after another, solitary and silent.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Sometime later he came upon the 
		wide roads of the city. One after another he passed along these avenues. 
		He saw that these roads too were submerged in darkness. Then he was 
		climbing up a circular staircase. Light fell on him from a bare bulb. He 
		stood in the red glow and stared at the damp wall from which the plaster 
		had peeled. A dank and clammy odour made him choke. The circular 
		stairwell was like a tunnel, drawing in cold air, and he started 
		shivering in the intense cold. When he placed his hand on the uneven 
		wall, the cold seemed to crawl up his fingers. A woman's face was 
		pencilled on the dirty, damp wall; next to it red bricks bared their 
		teeth. He couldn't tell exactly where the light was coming from. Again 
		he was climbing the stairs-to the first, the second, the third, the 
		fourth floors. He climbed right to the top of the stairs and banged on 
		the closed door.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He shouted, &quot;Asit, are you 
		there? Are you there, Asit? Asit, are you home?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The whole house quivered at the 
		sound of the clanging doorknocker. As in an earthquake, the very 
		foundation of the house shuddered. He kept on banging the door with his 
		fist and shouting, &quot;Asit, are you home? Asit, where are you?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;There was a small noise at the 
		other side of the door. The frightened voice of a woman asked, &quot;Who is 
		it? Who is it? Who's there?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He kept on calling &quot;Asit, Asit&quot; 
		without paying any attention. He stopped shouting when a panel of the 
		door opened. A face peered out from behind the panel. He was ashamed as 
		he looked at the pale, thin face of the woman. He saw that her large 
		eyes were dilated with fear. Holding onto the door for all her life, the 
		woman whispered in a voice filled with terror, &quot;Who do you want?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&quot;Isn't Asit here? Doesn't Asit 
		live in this house?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;No, we don't know anyone called 
		Asit. Who are you?&quot; &quot;Did anyone called Asit ever live in this house?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I don't know. We're new here,&quot; 
		saying this, the woman quickly closed the door.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Suddenly, the red light seemed 
		to have disappeared as well. He stood at the top of the stairs in the 
		cold. Leaning on the railing, he glanced at the well-like, dark hole of 
		the stairwell. Then he prepared to jump. Just as a cat jumps on cotton 
		wool, he tried to jump and drown in the empty darkness. But then he 
		started descending the stairs which echoed with the heavy tread of his 
		feet. He climbed down for a long time like an enraged phantom, circling 
		around, holding onto the wall, rubbing his nose lightly on the moss. 
		Outside on the road he sat down on a low culvert, his chin on his knees.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He heard the sound of a rifle 
		far away-but couldn't hear the sound of the wind even if he pricked up 
		his ears. He raised his face and looked up at the sky once. There were 
		no stars and no clouds. He seemed to be awaiting some terrible sound. 
		But, irritated when nothing happened, he started walking again. The 
		squarish houses were distributed on either side of the road, the low 
		roofs shining in the indistinct darkness. Small dusty paths and 
		black-tarred roads wound off from the houses and snaked their way 
		towards the inner rooms of terror.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now he could hear the sound of a 
		heavy vehicle from some road behind him. Within a short while the solemn 
		grumbling of the engine rang in his ears. The sound grew, but, as the 
		car tWisted round the innumerable bends, the sound sometimes grew and 
		diminished, but did not disappear. Then it returned and entered his 
		chest. The sound couldn't be forced out in any way. It seemed to be 
		spiraling its way down to the nether earth like a screw and then coming 
		up again in the same way.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He was feeling cold. He pulled 
		up the collar of his coat as much as he could to try and cover his ears. 
		Then he rubbed his hands together very hard. The houses on either side 
		were silent. Not a chink of light could be seen, no one was calling out 
		to anyone else, no one had spoken, no one had pushed at the door. All 
		the doors were shut tight.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A jeep screeched to a stop in 
		the middle of the main road. He turned into the road on the right and 
		hid in the dark shadows of a big house. He heard the moaning of a woman 
		from where he stood and felt a strong ache inside his chest. Once he had 
		been buried under an earthen wall that had fallen down, bits of earth 
		had entered his nostrils, and he hadn't been able to breathe. It was 
		like that now. He stepped forward to go to the jeep. But then he grew 
		confused. Where was he? Was this a dream within a dream or reality? 
		Someone struck a match. In the brief light he saw a fair, sharp-featured 
		man and the silhouette of a gagged woman. He started moving forward. At 
		that moment somebody leaped on to the jeep and it sped away.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;The man turned his face and saw 
		with surprise that the moon had arisen. He was standing at the turn of 
		the widest road in the city. The moon climbed quickly. He could see far 
		down the straight and broad road. The houses on both sides of the road 
		looked like ancient, solitary edifices in the middle of a desert. Broken 
		down old houses and buildings dug up in the dead light of the afternoon, 
		with the roofs not all at the same height, broad avenues and a superb 
		sewage system, narrow pathways-it had it all, this city. The bright 
		white houses cast deep, dark shadows on the other houses, on the road. 
		There were long walls fronting some of the houses. There were flowering 
		plants on the other side of the walls, untended thorny plants, moss 
		covered bricks. Notices hung beside some of the gates, &quot;Beware of Dog.&quot; 
		But no dog barked. Some of the houses were high, some low, some new, 
		recently painted, some were old and dank smelling, damp and dark with 
		grapefruit trees, thick patabahar plants. There was some fallow land 
		nearby. Through the streets, past the alleys, sometimes through the 
		shadows, sometimes with head held high in the moonlight, he walked on, 
		very tall, straight, clad in a thick coat, dragging his dusty boots. He 
		moved like a machine, his speed neither fast nor slow, but continuous 
		and relentless like the hands of a watch. He felt bad and, sitting down 
		on the ground, he took off his boots. Yanking his socks off, he freed 
		his feet and sighed in relief, &quot;Ahh.&quot; He shook out his socks with a 
		crackly noise and banged his boots on the tarred road. Then, with his 
		shoes and socks in hand, he walked into a dark alley.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When he was halfway through the 
		alley, he heard the sound of feet and voices from the main road. &quot;Speak 
		you bugger, are you Joy BangIa?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;No,&quot; someone answered.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Of course you're Joy BangIa.&quot; A 
		blunt thud followed. With a strange feeling, with his shoes in his hand, 
		his folio bag tucked under his arm, he crawled towards the street. He 
		saw some people in the moonlight.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Are you Hindu?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; someone said again.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&quot;Of course you're Hindu&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the moonlight he saw eight to 
		ten people surrounding one man. The man in the middle was bare-chested, 
		clad only in a pair of black shorts.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Where is your home?&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;There was no response. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Where is Joy Bangia?&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;The man said not a word.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One of the captors threw a 
		tremendous punch at the man in the black shorts who fell on his face.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;You bugger, we'll shoot you.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Go ahead do it,&quot; he said 
		sitting up and wiping his face.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;You Bengali dog, you're not the 
		Mukti Fouj? You bugger, you Mujib worshipper.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;No&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;You're not a Hindu?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;No&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Come, brother, shoot him.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;No, no, I won't shoot him-just 
		see what I do.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some minutes later, from his 
		hiding place in the alley, he saw the man in the black shorts sailing 
		feet foremost towards the roof of the single-storeyed house in front. 
		His head was pointed down towards the earth. Some soldiers pulled on a 
		rope like a pulley. The man's feet were tied to an iron rod. When the 
		head of the man in the black shorts had gone about five feet up in the 
		air, a voice said, &quot;That's it, stop. What, you're not Joy BangIa?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;No&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The voice said, &quot;Go ahead, 
		brothers, let go of the rope.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the man in the black 
		shorts banged the t~rred road with the whole weight of his body from 
		five feet up. From deep within his chest he said, &quot;Ahh.&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His head left the earth again.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Are you or aren't you Joy 
		BangIa?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A rumbling sound came from the 
		throat of the man in the black shorts. He turned the rumble into words, 
		&quot;The Bangalis are going to finish you off. You'd better get out of 
		Bangladesh &quot; Before he had finished speaking, the sound of raw flesh 
		slapped the earth.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;Standing up in the alley, the 
		pedestrian swayed. Weaving like a drunkard, he pushed on through the 
		darkness and along the side street, by the roads, past the alleys, till 
		he came and stood in the compound of a single-storeyed house. The 
		compound was surrounded by a low wall, with a hibiscus plant in one 
		corner. He quietly climbed onto the red broad veranda and, standing in 
		front of the closed door, called in a tender voice, &quot;Mamata, are you 
		there? Mamata?&quot;</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">No one responded. He called many 
		times. Finally, as he placed his hand on the door, the door swung open. 
		It was dark inside the room. He went inside the room and called, &quot;Mamata 
		are you there? Mamata?&quot; Once or tWice he called &quot;Shobhon.&quot; He left the 
		room and went to the inner veranda-there was no one there. He went into 
		the rooms on that side, went to the kitchen, the toilet. He called 
		Mamata with such concentration that he stumbled on the mattress. &quot;Where 
		is Mamata?&quot; he kept on asking himself as he walked to the closet, 
		brushing his hand against a tabletop.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Then he came and stood in the 
		inner courtyard and looked at the house. With the high buildings all 
		around, the house looked like a well. The black shadows of the 
		surrounding houses fell on the low house. Almost three-quarters of the 
		yard, covered with dead leaves, was shrouded in darkness. He walked 
		about, his feet crushing the leaves. He went to the dead tree, his legs 
		covered in dead leaves up to his ankles. He peeked into the filled up 
		well once. He hurt his knee badly on an old rusty spade.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The man took his shoes off and 
		tossed them to one side. Then he flung away his folio bag. He took off 
		his coat, tie and shirt one by one. His hairy chest swelled through his 
		undershirt. His slightly mad eyes grew more confused. He picked the 
		spade up with his veined, muscled arm. Twice or thrice he made a kind of 
		hacking noise through his nose and mouth as he dug the yard. Then he 
		stooped down and picked up a rib bone, curved like a scimitar. He held 
		it to his nose and smelled it. Then he caressed it. He again commenced 
		digging the yard. One by one emerged arm bones, the long bones of a leg, 
		the arid white bones of a foot.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He dug forcefully. Sometimes he 
		put the spade down and scratched at the earth with his nails like an 
		animal. Sweat poured down his body. He licked the salt drops off his 
		lips. He finally found a small hand. Picking it up, he said, as if to 
		himself, &quot;Shobhon, good job.&quot; Then he threw up a swathe of long hair, 
		the soft bone of the throat, small rib bones, broad hip bones and, 
		finally, a skull. Holding the skull in his hand, he stared at the empty 
		eye sockets. He placed his own eyes close to the empty eyes of the skull 
		and gazed steadily at the rows of teeth. The skull laughed a terrible 
		laugh from within the hollow cavity of its mouth.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Mamata,&quot; the man said. He 
		placed the skull beside him on the earth and started digging again with 
		renewedardour. He will dig out the very innards of the earth.</font></p>
