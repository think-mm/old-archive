	<font face="Verdana">Early in
  my teens, I began to lose my faith. It was a gradual process of asking myself
  questions until one day I realized that religion simply did not make sense
  to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">I was a
  child, and religion – or God – was not something I had thought much about.
  Till then, my experience of religion was to a large extent similar to other
  people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was something that was
  just there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew that I was
  muslim, that this involved learning Arabic as it was the language of the Quran,
  namaz (which everyone should do, but was mostly just performed by the elder
  relatives, my grandparents, and especially for men, was enough once a week at
  Jumma), and being muslim also meant eid and shab-e-barat. Gorgeous food, the
  brightness of mehndi on my palms, shiny new clothes and the crackle of new
  shoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were other things of
  course, the bits and pieces we learnt at school, the suras and hadiths, the
  anecdotes of the Prophet’s life, learning good and evil – guna and sowab,
  halal and haram, pak and napak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
  was just the way things were – just as I knew that I was a child who would
  grow up one day and that parents knew everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I just knew that Allah was there and would remain so until I was good
  and ready to deal with him. Except that when the time came, he was not there.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">But all
  that came later – the doubt, the self doubt, the compromises I made with
  myself and within myself to retain a semblance of faith, so that I did not
  feel too lost and too alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  whole process of not accepting without question all that I am told, or given
  began with what happened one spring morning when I was 11 or 12 years old.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">I was a
  maktab student then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My parents,
  in an attempt to educate us in more ways than one, enrolled my brother and
  myself in the maktab nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
  would wake up intolerably early and trudge to the maktab with our Kaidas.
  Still at the frock wearing age, I would put on a shalwar and an orna for the
  occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One morning I was late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>To hurry things along mom sent me off to the maktab in my nightie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>She didn’t forget my orna though. It was a long dress reaching down
  to my toes. Which is why mother thought it was ok for me to wear it without a
  shalwar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I mean the point was
  that my body be covered neck down to my ankles and that my head be covered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>My dress and my orna did that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
  I got to the maktab, our Hujoor called me and asked (in front of all my
  friends), ‘Tomar jamar niche ki?’ (What’s under your dress?)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Then he went on to yell about the various improprieties carried out by
  university teachers and their children and that I should get out of his maktab
  and only dare come back when I was properly clothed. I could feel my ears
  burning in shame and rage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  could hear all the children sniggering and I remember running straight home.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The shame
  I felt was two-fold – there was the fact that I had been humiliated in front
  of the other children; and then there was the fact that though I wasn’t sure
  why, there was a niggling feeling in my mind that there was something almost
  indecent in the way Hujoor had asked what I had under my dress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I cried my eyes out and being very stubborn told mom that I would never
  go back . She, being more understanding than I gave her credit for, never
  forced me back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">I recount
  this episode for two reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First,
  because it set me thinking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
  far as I could learn through careful questioning, the idea was to cover my
  body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That had been accomplished.
  Then why did Hujoor embarrass me like that? This question nobody logically
  answered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then overcoming my
  initial embarrassment I asked father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
  father, a teacher, has long inculcated the habit of producing a lengthy
  lecture on being asked a question – it’s become a reflex action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">He told me
  that it was hard for people to look beyond the immediate facts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>To the Hujoor’s mind, I was a girl and should be wearing a shalwar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>He probably didn’t intend to make any indecent innuendo, it was only
  that he was a man of limited education, and his choice of words was
  unfortunate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To his mind if I was
  not wearing a shalwar I was inappropriately dressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>That was all he was attempting to ascertain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>But my legs were covered with my dress, I argued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">was </i>appropriately dressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Theoretically, I was correct, my father replied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>But the Hujoor wasn’t thinking rationally, most people didn’t. To
  him I was a girl and should be dressed in a specific way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If I wasn’t, then whether whatever else I was wearing was
  accomplishing the same purpose did not matter to him – I would still be
  inappropriately dressed. It was as if with that incident, a lot of things that
  had been bothering me crystallized and began a process.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">If my
  wearing a long dress was inappropriate then wasn’t my wearing a frock (which
  left my legs uncovered) even more so? But all the other girls of my age wore
  frocks and that didn’t seem to bother anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Yet my wearing pants (like boys) seemed to bother everyone – yet
  pants kept my legs totally covered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How
  could I possibly make sense of that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  began to see the illogicality of religion <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">as
  practiced by most people</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
  notice that I made that distinction – religion <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">as
  practiced</i>, religion itself had still not lost its place in my eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The second
  process that the maktab incident set off was that I began to realise what
  small men these “Teachers of Faith” were. Of the Hujoors I had known till
  then, one I have mentioned. Among the others there was a wife beater,
  otherwise a kindly man, and another who excelled in devising punishments for
  children especially young boys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  now realize that there is more than one way of “beating” a woman (as the
  saying goes in Bangla, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Hate Na mere
  Bhate Mara</i>) and that probably other men were no better husbands than he
  was and that the propensity for bullying the weak is not the domain of
  religious teachers – but at that time these sins seemed the lowest of the
  low.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">These, I
  questioned myself, were people we were supposed to respect? Because they
  carried the word of God to us? These men of limited understanding, these men
  of tarnished souls who reduced the glory of this god-given life to a set of
  blind rules and customs to be observed without understanding.&nbsp;<O:P>
  </O:P>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">I suppose
  I should feel grateful to that Hujoor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
  it was his short sightedness and his failure to distinguish between decency
  and indecency (for it seemed to me then that his words were a hundred times
  more indecent than even if I had been wearing nothing at all) that made me
  begin to ask questions; that made me become an agnostic at the ripe old age of
  14.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But I still retained my
  faith in the essence of my religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<O:P>

  </O:P>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">The path
  from doubting what people told me to doubting the very existence of god was
  quite short in terms of time – but it was not an easy path.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I found out that supposedly rational, and otherwise sensible people
  could not react with equanimity when questioned closely about Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>There was the type that would not tolerate questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Then there was the type that would tolerate questions, but the
  questions. alongside the answers. they would formulate themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Then there was the type that would allow you any question at all (these
  were the liberated, modern-thinking muslims) <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">
	but only up to a certain </i>point.&nbsp; There
  would always be some point when the answer would be Faith was simply a matter
  of believing not logic.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">By then I
  was hanging on to my faith by the slenderest of threads.&nbsp;
  I had come to the conclusion – and in this conclusion a lot of those
  from the third type agreed – that the inconsistencies and a lot of what
  seemed barbaric in Islam stemmed from the fact that this was a religion over a
  thousand years old.&nbsp; A lot of
  Muhammad’s actions and words (polygamy, child marriages, declaring women as
  the spoils of war) could be explained by the fact that as all human beings, he
  was a child of his time. This I made myself believe until one day the
  glaring inconsistency hit me – if certain Islamic practices seemed barbaric
  in the light of today, that meant that Islam and the Prophet were
  appropriate only for that particular time in human history.&nbsp;
  Yet the Quran was said to be a book of divine origin for all time and
  for all people and the Prophet’s life was supposed to be emulated by all
  good Muslims.&nbsp; It was a shock to
  my whole system.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">How could
  I reconcile what I perceived as good (ironically a lot of which I had gleaned
  from religion itself) with the other things that I found in religion? After
  seeing the words that relegated all women to being second best all our lives,
  how could I retain my sense of self, my pride in who I was?&nbsp; I rejected religion at first simply because if I continued to
  believe in what was written in that book, I no longer had the vast spaces of
  my mind to move through; because it limited and constrained my world instead
  of making it the place of the unlimited possibilities of my imaginings.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">That
  book told me that no matter how much I read, how much I knew, no matter what
  love and compassion for people I held in my breast, no matter my intelligence,
  my talents, my love of laughter, I would never ever be as good as even the
  lowliest of men. Because I was a woman.&nbsp; I
  was a field for a man to sow his seed, I was part of the spoils of war for a
  warrior, I was impure at times because I had the power to breed children, my
  word was not to be trusted against that of a man, I was the gateway to hell
  because men would desire me.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">How could
  I live my life with that? I stopped believing at all. But then what was the
  alternative?&nbsp; What did non-belief
  have to offer me that belief did not?&nbsp; Let
  me tell you.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Atheism
  treats human beings as adults – religion does not. Atheism believes that
  humans are capable of living a good life, and are capable of doing good
  because it is in our nature to do good. That humans need no stick
  of eternal and divine punishment or carrot of eternal and divine bliss to
  achieve goodness.&nbsp; Religion
  limits our capacity to be human. Religion believes that a man will not treat
  his wife, children, family or friends as he should, or that a woman will
  disgrace herself and betray her family if he or she is not afraid of burning
  in hellfire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;How could
  any system of belief compete with the dignity and the respect that non-belief
  had to offer to me?&nbsp; If I was a
  religious being I was relegated to the status of second class citizen as a
  woman.&nbsp; If I was a religious
  creature I was merely created by a divine being to sing His glory to the
  stars.&nbsp; Instead I decided that I
  was human, the highest in the order of life, I was infinite possibility, I was
  the limitless sky, I was the sun’s laughter.&nbsp;
  I would be captain of my own ship.&nbsp;
  I would do good and not evil, not because I would be allowed a good
  time when I died, but because good was worth doing because
  it was good.&nbsp; Because I, as a
  human, among all the creatures, had the unique capacity to distinguish between
  good and evil; and the will to choose between them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">I have
  talked with many believers on the manner and the nature of belief during my
  short span of life.&nbsp; At one point
  they all seem to feel affronted by my lack of faith. Most of them go on to
  tell me how transient and fruitless is the earthly life that I live no matter
  what base pleasure it might give me.&nbsp; What
  every single one of them fail to understand is how intensely and for how long
  I had yearned to be a believer.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">Faith
  meant that I had an all powerful all knowing all loving father figure watching
  over me.&nbsp; Anything bad that
  happened to me – he’d take care of me one way or another, if not in this
  earthly life then in the next.&nbsp; Was
  there anything more comforting than that?&nbsp;
  To know that evil would not triumph, that the anguish of the innocent
  in this world would not go unavenged – that “God’s in his heaven,
  all’s right with the world”.&nbsp; The
  temptation to leave everything in the hands of a deity was immense.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 125%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">
	<font face="Verdana">I would
  give a lot to be able to believe. But in the end I had to tread the rocky and
  non-comforting path of atheism.&nbsp; I
  gave up the shelter of a divine shadow – but I gained a life that could
  question and explore every nook and cranny of existence.&nbsp;
  I questioned and rejected religion and became
  an atheist because I could not answer the inconsistencies of religion to
  myself, and because religion limited me as a human being – I remain an
  atheist because I have discovered that I do not need religion to tell me who I
  am.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
