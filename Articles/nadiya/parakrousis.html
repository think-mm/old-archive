	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><span class="bd">She stood calmly as 
	she watched the child burn. The lighter fluid she had poured onto the girl’s 
	dress had caught fire with the swiftness and ease of a kingfisher plucking a 
	fish from water in mid-flight. It delighted her – the sudden and brilliant 
	violence with which the fire blossomed on the girl’s body, like some unholy 
	flower with an indelicate scent. The sharply distinct and ugly odor of 
	charred flesh attacked her nostrils. She breathed in deeply, inhaling the 
	stench. The child was screaming of course. And writhing around on the floor, 
	trying to put out the flames eating into her flesh. She was calling for her 
	ma, her grandma, anyone to help her. But she had been doused well with the 
	fluid and the synthetic material of the child’s bright red dress, instead of 
	burning, simply melted into a sickly sludge, sizzling and sticking to her 
	skin. The look of utter disbelief the child had thrown at her when she had 
	lighted the match and dropped it in her lap was satisfying in itself. The 
	child was making less and less noise now, indistinguishable moans were all. 
	The melody of pure pain. She wondered whether the flames would manage to eat 
	through her skull and jaws, and how long it would take for her tongue and 
	vocal chords to burn. That would shut her up for good. The Hindus burned 
	their dead, didn’t they, and she had heard that it was very difficult to 
	actually burn the skull or the belly button. They had to crack open the 
	skull to make it burn properly. But why the bellybutton, she wondered? What 
	was so special about that? She watched with interest as the smooth taut skin 
	on the child’s torso split, oozing a pinkish juice. There were faint 
	crackles as the girl’s hair erupted, crowning her briefly with incandescent 
	orange petals. She watched for several moments more, then walked away. 
	Someone else would do the cleaning up today.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Mami,’ called the girl in the bright red dress, ‘why did you make 
	noodles again today? I had noodles for tea yesterday AND the day before. I 
	hate having the same thing everyday, I hate it!’ She smiled and tried to 
	calm her sister-in-law’s child in a soft voice, ‘I’m sorry, I just didn’t 
	have time today to make something different.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You mean, this is yesterday’s?’ The child’s whine turned into a screech, 
	pitched exactly to reach the ears of her grandmother in the next room. ‘You 
	know my mommy never lets me eat old food, it’s bad for my health!’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With perfect timing the old woman emerged. ‘What is it? Drink up your 
	milk dear, like a good girl…’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘She gave me yesterday’s noodles…’ the child screamed.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘No, no,’ the old woman shook her head with a cross look and turned to 
	her daughter-in-law. ‘She has a delicate stomach. We must be careful with 
	her. What have you given her?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Ma,’ she tried to explain, ‘You know we are having to prepare for 
	Shab-e-Barat next week. Both the maid and I have been busy all day. We have 
	to make all that halwa, you know. I simply didn’t have time to make 
	something new today, and I cooked a lot of noodles on purpose yesterday, so 
	it could be eaten today as well.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘So why don’t you give her some halwa that you’ve made?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Yes yes yes yes yes I want halwa’, screeched the spoilt little brat.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Well, I haven’t finished making the halwa yet, it took the whole day 
	just to boil and make a paste of the chick peas. Actually we still haven’t 
	finished grinding it. I just came out to serve her milk and snacks.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I want halwa,’ wailed the girl.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Well!’ sniffed her mother-in-law, ‘This is your house now, since you’ve 
	married my son, but in my time things were run differently in this 
	household.’ The old women twisted her lips in disdain.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh how she hated that! ‘Ma, she tried explaining again, Tomorrow I’ll…’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Do whatever you want, girl, none of this is my concern. After all, how 
	can I expect too much from you? It might have been different if she had been 
	the child of your own sister. And I understand, you perhaps resent the fact 
	that her mother has a big job, while you couldn’t even finish your studies. 
	Just don’t take it out on the child, not while I’m alive.’ The old woman 
	went off towards the kitchen, leaving the child with, ‘If your aunt feels 
	like it, then you’ll get some halwa…maybe tomorrow…’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child looked at her with such unrelenting venom that she cringed 
	inside like a whipped dog. The girl was only seven years old. How could a 
	seven-year-old look at someone like that? What knowledge did the child have 
	that she lacked?<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman lay helpless in the bed, unable to move because of her bad 
	back and also because of the strips of cloth binding her to the bedposts. 
	The old woman watched the steady certain movements of her daughter-in-law 
	with such abject fear in her eyes that it made up for everything – 
	everything.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up the skewer she had brought from the kitchen when she had 
	gone for the mustard oil to massage on her mother-in-law’s back. She placed 
	it delicately against the dry withered skin of the old woman, rolling it a 
	little, letting the coldness of the iron make itself known to her senses.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman was praying in a low voice, tears running down her face as 
	if the floodgates somewhere had burst open in high monsoon. But they weren’t 
	tears of apology or understanding, were they? Or remorse? They were fear, 
	and loathing and who knows what else. But that would do, that was good 
	enough for today.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She removed the skewer and looked at it for a moment, admiring how black 
	it had turned with age and the blood and the juice of the mounds and mounds 
	of kebabs that had been impaled on it. She placed it between the middle of 
	her index and thumb and thrust it in and out, up and down like an instrument 
	of forbidden pleasure, feeling the cool smoothness, the sheen and the 
	inflexibility of the metal against her own flesh, marveling at how certain 
	it was in its purpose, how utterly and unchangeably beautiful. The chanting 
	rhythm of Arabic verses rang in her ears, broken now and then by desperate 
	sobs; the beauty and holiness of the sounds moving her to tears. The old 
	woman never asked for mercy not once; was it sheer stubbornness and pride or 
	was it that her mother-in-law had finally come to see the black iron she had 
	had in her soul all along?<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She poured a little mustard oil in her palm, and closed her palm around 
	the thin rod, massaging the oil onto the skewer. Shiny and darkly bright it 
	became in the blink of an eye. She leaned over her mother-in-law, waiting 
	for her to break, certain in the knowledge that she would. The old woman was 
	sniveling now, the snot running out of the raggedy nostrils infuriated her, 
	disgusted her. She placed the tip of the skewer on the old bag’s right 
	eyelid, gently forcing it to close. The pathetic body lying helpless in the 
	bed was trembling now. She waited a moment, unable to decide whether the 
	left eye or the right one, left brain or right? Should she just run it 
	straight in or should she try and cut the eyelid off first? Maybe shave off 
	her eyebrow? She laughed in a low voice imagining how the old woman would 
	look with one eyebrow gone. Slowly she increased the pressure on the skewer 
	enjoying the slight resistance from the flesh underneath.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muted praying of the old woman became high pitched with the constant 
	plea of Allah Oh Allah breaking up the rhythm. Fear had such a readily 
	identifiable sound. Then she looked at her with her other eye and said in a 
	ragged voice, ‘No….please…’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and with a sudden deft thrust, plunged the skewer into the 
	eyeball, going straight to the unresisting brain so hard and so fast that 
	the iron tip banged off against the back of the skull. Crimson warm liquid 
	spurted out (as did a single very brief terrified scream) and hit her 
	straight in her face as she hovered over the old woman trying to determine 
	to the second the exact moment that the spark left the eyes. She breathed 
	silently, tasting the lingering saltiness of blood that had splattered on 
	her tongue.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘A little lower,’ instructed the old woman. She dripped some more mustard 
	oil on her palms and moved her hands to her mother-in-law’s lower back. Ma 
	sighed in pleasure. ‘You have magic hands, Daughter,’ she blessed her 
	daughter-in-law. You are the only one who can make my back better when it is 
	this bad.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dutiful daughter-in-law smiled at the compliment. Her arms were 
	aching, the massage had been going on for over an hour now. ‘You’re feeling 
	a little better, Ma? She couldn’t help asking.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Yes, dear, I know you must be tired, but could you continue just a while 
	longer? Please?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Of course, Ma,’ she smiled again. ‘As long as you want. It hasn’t been 
	that long.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman smiled at her, ‘Ah, you have young arms, young hands, time 
	is not the same for you and me.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled again, ‘Ma, why don’t you try and get some rest? I won’t leave 
	until you’re fast asleep, you know.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother-in-law smiled at the gentle scolding and the indulgent smile 
	of the daughter- in-law. She lay back with a long sigh and closed her eyes 
	like an obedient little girl, submitting herself to the loving caresses.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bruise on her sister-in-law’s forehead changed colour as she watched 
	– turning a deep red bordering almost on purple. The young woman lay on the 
	floor just as she had fallen when hit on the head with the heavy bluntness 
	of the solid stone sheel.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knelt down and eased out her right arm from the uncomfortable 
	position under the body. No reason to make the young woman uncomfortable 
	yet, was there? She sat down beside her sister-in- law, with her head on her 
	haunches, and gently tucked the few untidy wisps of hair behind her ear. She 
	touched the bruised skin on her temple. The blood coagulating just beneath 
	the surface of the skin felt hot and smooth somehow, skin like white satin. 
	Her sister-in-law had a beautiful complexion, flawless skin. She gently 
	stroked her forehead, luxuriating in the creamy softness of her skin. She 
	increased the pressure of her fingers on the bruise, watching to see whether 
	the renewed pain woke her up. But she just lay there as lifeless as a body 
	that was already dead. She moved her finger slightly left and pressed deep 
	and hard to see whether she could raise a welt on the skin without the aid 
	of any other implement. She felt the resistance of the skull behind the skin 
	with slick satisfaction. She picked up the heavy sheel again. The stone 
	implement still retained the comfortable scent of the spices it had ground 
	throughout its lifetime. Pretty soon that aroma would be overtaken by the 
	warm stench of blood and other matter. Anything to do with flesh always had 
	such a distinctive, unmistakable odour.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp crack of the sheel hitting her sister-in-law’s skull jolted 
	her. She held the sheel in both hands and stared at the head as it lay 
	before her. A soft, drawn-out moan escaped her slightly parted lips as if in 
	lieu of the sounds the face on the floor should be making. She raised her 
	arms high above her head and brought the sheel determinedly down again with 
	a vicious sound to connect with the forehead. This time she managed to bash 
	in the skull. Chips of white bone flew out like fragile shrapnel stinging 
	her cheeks and clinging to her hair. The blood that oozed out was darker 
	than she’d imagined and somehow thicker. The viscous membrane with its 
	delicate network of darker veins that covered the brain was visible through 
	the opening she had made. The brain had been pushed back a bit with the 
	force of the blow but it appeared that the sac was unbroken. She settled 
	herself down on the floor beside her sister-in-law’s prone body and 
	cautiously poked a finger in the brain. To her astonishment, the hitherto 
	inert body shuddered once accompanied by a low moan. She felt a cold anger 
	pervade her senses, clouding her mind and even her eyes. She thrust her 
	finger into the squishiness of the brain, tearing through the fragile 
	membrane as if raping the virgin skull of the woman who had almost been her 
	friend. The body quivered briefly. She picked up the now reddened sheel and 
	brought it down bluntly upon the cracked skull. Pieces of pinkish white 
	brain matter were stuck to it when she lifted it again. She stood up and 
	almost slipped on the clotted blood on the floor. There was something white 
	lodged in the congealing blood. Bone or brain? She poked at the white mass 
	with her big toe, and it smeared onto the floor. Okay, it had been brain.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had hated this set of sheel-pata ever since she had come to this 
	house. Too heavy, her arms always ached as she spent hours hunched over it, 
	moving her waist and her ass back and forth rhythmically as she ground the 
	coarse spices into paste.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Bhabi,’ her sister-in-law said in an exasperated tone, ‘Why don’t you 
	please tell the maid to do that? Why do we keep her if we have to do all the 
	work?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat back, all sweaty and aching and flexed the muscles of her arms. 
	‘Because, madam, the maid never does it properly, she always leaves it 
	coarse and I like my spices to be perfect.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sister-in-law laughed. ‘Well, madam, if you insist on being such a 
	perfectionist…Really, Bhabi, can anyone tell the difference once the cooking 
	is done?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Yes, dear, they can, she began to laugh. Which is why there are such 
	varied reactions to your cooking and mine.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sister-in- law burst out laughing.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a family joke; her sister-in-law was a terrible cook. The sounds 
	of their mingled laughter cut through the air sharp and clear like diamonds.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband had come home late today. He walked into the bedroom tired, 
	sweaty and irritable.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You look tired,’ she said.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snapped, ‘What do you expect? Sorry I can’t look like Prince Charming 
	after a ten-hour work day.’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled at him and said soothingly, ‘That’s not what I meant at all. I 
	just thought you might feel fresh after a hot bath. Want me to heat up some 
	water?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at her with scrunched up brows then his eyes cleared. He smiled 
	at her and said, ‘Why are you so nice to me when I behave so badly with 
	you?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled back. ‘Because I’m such a good wife. She laughed. Now do you 
	want some hot water or not?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head. ‘Maybe later.’ He took his shirt off and sat down on 
	the bed with his lungi in hand, ‘I just want to take a short nap. Call me 
	when dinner is ready?’<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watched his fleshy thighs become exposed as he took off his formal 
	trousers and changed into his lungi. He had gained some weight in the past 
	few months, developing a small paunch instead of the tight, flat stomach he 
	used to have. She looked at the sparse hair on his belly that gave his skin 
	a slightly rougher texture, remembering the feel of it under her palm when 
	she caressed him. He scratched his belly lazily and yawned. She felt the 
	tension in her fingertips, the fragility of her mind delicately poised in 
	flight, moving with ease towards the familiar tautness like a tightly coiled 
	spring; it would be difficult to disembowel him…slicing through the skin, 
	dermis, epidermis, the layers of fat, flesh, the network of veins, 
	viscera…blood sluicing off and pooling by her feet on the clean shiny 
	floor... </span><!-- table 07 column3 --></font></p>
