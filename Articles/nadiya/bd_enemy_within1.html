  Enemy Within</strong></font></p>

  <h2 align="center">I</h2>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">At its birth in 1971, Bangladesh inherited a political
  culture of deep division and distrust from its past with Pakistan and the
  British Raj.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the post Liberation period, Bangladeshi
  politics seems to have followed the same path where party politics becomes
  more important than the good of the people and where sacrificing individual
  good for the common good has been relegated to mere rhetoric. <span>&nbsp;</span>It
  is time now to consider whether we have been able to achieve anything for
  ourselves within this legacy.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Although officially a “People’s Republic”, in
  reality Bangladesh has alternated between periods when shaky democratic
  governments have been in place only to be usurped by military regimes.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>The inability of the nation to evolve into a stable democratic system
  only points to the fact that two decades into its existence, Bangladesh has
  yet to recover from a system characterized by mistrust, mutual threats,
  hostilities and confrontations between the various political parties. The
  resurgence in religious fundamentalism in politics has only added to the
  country’s problems.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">In keeping with the majority of South Asian nations, the
  Bangladeshi political system may be characterised as being intolerant of
  dissension – within the party as well as without.<span>&nbsp; </span>Inner
  party democracy is practically non-existent in most cases, further vitiated by
  the dynastic political culture that has evolved. Another entrenched
  characteristic seems to be the role and effects of political assassinations.
  The heads of the two major political parties have both “inherited” their
  positions as leaders, one from her father, the other from her husband, both of
  whom were heads of state. Sheikh Mujib’s legacy in Bangladesh is continued
  by his daughter the present Prime Minister after his assassination in 1975 and
  Ziaur Rahman’s (assassinated in 1981) political leadership is carried on by
  his widow, the opposition leader during the previous government.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Historically, the relationship between Bangladesh and its
  neighbours has been determined by political imperatives rather than economic
  ones.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bangladesh’s relationship with Pakistan has been
  fraught with difficulties – the hurt and the anger that both sides felt over
  the birth of an independent Bangladesh is yet to be resolved.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although
  throughout its history, Bangladesh has regarded India an ally, differences
  over water sharing and intermittent border clashes have marred the
  relationship<a title name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[2]</span></a>.
  The long tradition of mutual political suspicion between the two largest
  countries of the region – India and Pakistan – (for reasons of ideological
  hatred as well as the issue of the independence of Kashmir) also has an
  influence on Bangladesh’s foreign policy.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>The sheer size of India (spreading over almost 72
  percent of South Asia’s geography) gives it a clout in the region unmatched
  by any other country in the region, even Pakistan.&nbsp; Consequently, India
  is the most important factor in determining the nature of inter-nation
  relationships within the region, especially for Bangladesh as most of
  Bangladesh’s borders are with India.&nbsp; For instance, Bhutan Bangladesh
  trade relations was hindered for a long time because of India’s intransigent
  attitude regarding overland transit for Bhutan. However, at present India has
  given transit facilities to both Nepal and Bhutan.&nbsp; <O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><span>It may also be said that India’s past
  insistence on bi-lateralism in dealing with Bangladesh instead of dealing from
  a regional perspective has, to a certain extent, impeded the process of
  integration. A case in point is the water sharing issue between the two
  countries. Bangladesh wanted to treat the Ganges and the Brahmaputra river
  basins as international water sources, especially in view of the fact that the
  water sharing issue was also relevant to Nepal; India disagreed.&nbsp; The
  water problem is yet to be resolved.<O>
  </O>
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Bangladesh and Indian bilateral trade may be seen to
  mirror the broader context of regional and sub-regional cooperation.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>Any move towards cooperation on a regional level will, to a certain
  extent, correspond with the relationship that the most powerful economy in the
  region has with its neighbours.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Bangladesh – India
  relationship therefore is important as testing ground for the economic future
  of the region.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">India plays a major role in Bangladesh’s trade sector.
  In 1996, about 25 percent (approximately) of total imports (both legal and
  illegal) in Bangladesh came from India. Bangladeshi products constituted only
  0.5 percent (approximately) of total Indian imports<a title name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[3]</span></a>.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>The economic relationship between Bangladesh and India has the
  potential of being mutually beneficial and rewarding.<span>&nbsp; </span>However,
  at present the situation is not one of interdependence but of one-sided
  dependence on the part of Bangladesh. The large bilateral trade deficit that
  exists in favour of India needs to be reduced before this scenario can be
  changed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Similar to India’s denial of transit facilities
  to Nepal and Bhutan, Bangladesh has long denied India overland transit
  facilities, which would significantly reduce costs of transporting goods to
  India’s North Eastern states.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, now that India has
  acceded transit to Nepal and Bhutan, it is time to rethink – alongside a
  number of other issues – the issue of comprehensive transit for and through
  other nations as well. The recent initiation of a direct bus service linking
  the capital of Bangladesh and the capital of West Bengal as well as the
  introduction of a train service is also indicative of the change in attitude
  of both India and Bangladesh.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<O>
  </O>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText2">Bangladesh’s relationship with Pakistan has never
  really recovered from the 1971 war.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite an officially
  friendly relationship, Bangladesh’s claims for war damages as well as a
  national apology is ill received in Pakistan and remain unresolved.<span>&nbsp;
  </span>However, the real unresolved issue between Bangladesh and Pakistan is
  regarding the repatriation of Bihari Mohajirs (refugees)<a title name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4"><span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[4]</span></a>
  stranded in Bangladesh since 1971.<span>&nbsp; </span>A significant number of
  Bihari refugees continue to live out their lives in refugee camps (which have
  effectively become urban slums) in the outskirts of Bangladesh’s capital
  with almost no hope of repatriation.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
