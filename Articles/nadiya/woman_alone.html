	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">The first 
	time I was sexually molested I was about six. I remember the incident 
	precisely; I can even smell the petrol fumes in the air. It was by the 
	filling station at Nilkhet, beside the row of lep-toshok shops, where we 
	used to wait for our Jahangirnagar University bus. Most of the shopkeepers 
	knew us and would even offer us stools to sit on if the wait got too long. I 
	was with my father that particular day. We had just crossed the road from 
	New Market where I'd had a cupcake slathered with purplish-pink frosting 
	from Lite Bakery. The crossing and then the petrol pump were a bit 
	traffic-mad as only Nilkhet can be and my dad had to be careful negotiating 
	them with a child. We had just climbed onto the slightly raised pavement 
	when it happened. It wasn't much of a molestation actually as these things 
	go, just an intrusive hand that forced itself into the crack of my butt over 
	my printed-denim skirt very briefly and was gone. I did not tell my father 
	what had happened. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">The 
	second time was years later, on the Jahangirnagar bus. I was with my mother. 
	It was the 8 o'clock trip from Dhaka. It was probably a “community bus”, 
	because there were both students and teachers on the bus and it was very 
	crowded. Usually students weren't allowed on the “teacher buses”. My mother 
	found a seat for me at the end of a three-seater and then went to the back 
	of the bus, certain that as she was a teacher someone would vacate a seat 
	for her. On my right sat a female student. The drivers habitually turned out 
	the lights during the nighttime trips as the light inside bothered their 
	vision, so it was almost dark in the bus. It was very hot, I remember -- the 
	warmth of too many bodies in too small a space. There was hardly room to 
	stand for those unluckies who had no seats -- students naturally. They stood 
	bent over the seats, grabbing onto the seatbacks to maintain balance. At 
	some point I felt a hand on my left breast. A skinny little runt, I hardly 
	had any breasts at 14, but the hand seemed to be satisfied with what it 
	found since it decided to remain. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">The trip 
	was usually around 70 minutes. The long, mostly uninhabited stretch of road 
	between Dhaka and Jahangirnagar was the darkest. The hand explored my breast 
	for about half an hour in that darkness, possibly more. It seemed an 
	eternity. Several times I tried twisting away my torso, to shield myself 
	with my shoulder or my back, but that didn't work. My movements made my 
	adult seatmate turn to me with a warm smile, “It's so crowded, are you 
	uncomfortable?” Like a fool, I blurted out, “That guy's touching me.” The 
	swiftness with which she whipped her head away would've made Muhammad Ali 
	proud. I realize now that she herself was barely an adult then, that back 
	then one didn't acknowledge in public that these things happened -- to 
	oneself or to others. For the rest of the trip she didn't turn to look at me 
	once. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">I don't 
	remember how I felt at six, but that evening I remember taking a l-o-n-g 
	shower when I got home. </font></p>

	Before I read Taslima Nasrin, I read bits and pieces of Beauvoir, Millet, 
	Friedan and Greer. A compilation of excerpts from their work was one among 
	the hundreds of books in our household. The book also included 
	Wollstonecraft, Mill, Woolf. My version of Feminism 101 came from a 
	secondhand bookstore in a cheap, slightly soiled, old-fashioned green 
	paperback. It would be years before I would actually manage to get hold of 
	copies of The Second Sex, The Feminine Mystique, Sexual Politics. Added to 
	all this was the deceptively gentle subversion of our own Rokeya. But before 
	I got to those classic tomes, blessedly I discovered Taslima's 
	NirbachitoKolum. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">I was a 
	teenager when Nirbachito Kolum first came out in book form. I'd heard of her 
	of course, and even read a few pieces here and there. But to me, back then 
	-- rabidly in love with words -- Taslima was more the radical poet Rudra's 
	ex-wife than a feminist writer. It was the book that exploded her into my 
	life. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">As much 
	as I had tried to absorb the Western feminists, the history of the 
	suffragettes, second wave feminism, even Rokeya's words -- their writing was 
	consumed, judged and digested at some intellectual level, connected to but 
	not truly part of what it meant being woman in Jahangirnagar, in Dhaka, on 
	the bus, in rickshaws, in school, at home everyday. But Taslima! Taslima was 
	the real thing, she was the ashol chini for me and countless others of my 
	generation. We might not have agreed with everything she said, but that she 
	said those things at all was, for then, enough. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">There 
	were those of us who stood hours waiting at Boi Mela to get a glimpse of 
	her. And not just girls either -- there were the Notre Dame boys who 
	searched out her house to knock on her door on a winter's morning to say, 
	“Apa, we read your book, we wanted to see you, just once.” Boys who admitted 
	that if Taslima had asked they would cheerfully have jumped off a building. 
	We would have done the same. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">I wept 
	when I read Taslima describing a young man burning her arm with a cigarette 
	in public. Or when I read, “Women who emerge from the home to set foot in 
	the street; those women -- not only me -- are all prepared to bear silently 
	any obscene remark in the streets.” This was the first time I realized that 
	what had happened to me on that bus and later as well, happened to others, 
	and was NOT MY FAULT. I cannot begin to describe what that meant to a 
	guilt-ridden teen, who lacked the knowledge that sexual harassment or 
	molestation was not an isolated incident, that it happened everywhere 
	everyday, that it could happen to anyone. Twenty years ago -- these were not 
	things discussed in bhodro society. </font></p>
	<p align="center">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333"><strong>
	***</strong><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">The 
	literary quality of Taslima Nasrin's oeuvre has been discussed and 
	questioned by many. For me, as a reader, Taslima's strength has always been 
	her non-fiction: her topical columns intertwined with her personal 
	experience is what granted her writing such visceral power. Her discussions 
	on religion -- apart from several choice quotes from a number of religious 
	texts -- lacked the depth and reflection necessary to germinate impetus 
	towards interrogation and examination. However, when she writes about the 
	soon-to-be-abandoned young wife made infertile because her husband had her 
	first pregnancy terminated, or the poetry-quoting friend of her youth lost 
	to a bad marriage, or when she speaks of her aunt (one of the countless 
	women raped by the Pakistani soldiers) who committed suicide, for her return 
	from war was a matter of shame and sorrow unlike the triumphant return of 
	Taslima's guerilla uncles -- it is our hearts she holds in the palms of her 
	hands.</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">These 
	days it seems that a lot of her non-fiction is over-generalized, catering to 
	certain audiences. She remains strangely silent on certain issues that 
	should arouse a writer worth the calling, and then overly and needlessly 
	voluble over others. Some of the choices she has made over the years remain 
	open to question.</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">I met 
	Taslima last year at a colloquium of women writers, in Delhi. I was 
	disappointed. The self-preoccupation, the endless recounting of the same 
	saga (which most of us knew anyway), the insipid regurgitation of her 
	victimhood was not what I wanted to come back with. Where was the 
	belly-cleansing fire? Where the searing empathy for our bee-stung hearts? I 
	wanted that other Taslima, the Taslima of the Nirbachito Kolum. The one who 
	could make the radical proposal that all men be tested for syphilis prior to 
	marriage, who knew that the “kick of manmade laws” descended on both the 
	women of the slums as on the women “empowered” through education, who called 
	upon women to become “hungry” enough to attack their aggressors, who 
	declared that she had thickened the soles of her shoes because she would 
	have to traverse the long path of this life by herself, who questioned an 
	actor who had committed suicide when her husband divorced her, “Why should 
	this rough terrain assail you so, when the rest of us women are used to this 
	roughness, grow speedy and lively upon it?”</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">But that 
	Taslima seemed to have disappeared in a confused welter of self-pity, the 
	essence of her words consumed by a careful crafting of columns and essays 
	redolent of repetitious expediency, a simplification of issues that are 
	complex and intertwined. The machinations of a fearful government bent on 
	placating ultraconservative forces in the trash-pile of Bangladeshi politics 
	led to her exile; Taslima's dismissal of what she derisively calls “tactics” 
	isolated her further, not only from the land of her birth, but from the 
	heartland from which her writing emerged. Not for her the full flowering of 
	her intellect, the free flow of thought and ideas that contain the 
	possibility of rebirthing known reality on alien soil. The resulting 
	disconnection from language, culture and community has muted the thunder of 
	Taslima's eloquent rhetoric. I find it tragically ironic that she had once 
	written, “…I am not growing. Sometimes I feel so suffocated within these 
	tiny confines that even if I make the rounds of this city seven times, this 
	city, this country seem as miniscule as a matchbox.” The exiled Taslima 
	traveled to distant and vast metropolises, but what borders were crossed in 
	the landscape of her imagination? </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">Exile for 
	an artist can be soul-sapping in many ways. To the extent that Taslima's 
	writing seems to be a rollercoaster ride spiraling inwards, it seems that 
	the mollas have, unfortunately, won after all. The sharp blade of her 
	rhetoric has transformed into a blunt weapon of intent; where she had 
	stormed onto our consciousness, the enforced cloister of exile has snapped 
	the thread of continuity with her land and her people. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">Taslima 
	opened a lot of doors for the likes of us. It's a pity that she has become a 
	travesty of who she used to be. </font></p>
	<p align="center">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333"><strong>
	***</strong></font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333"><br>
	As I reread Nirbachito Kolum today, I am struck by the datedness of some 
	passages and this, I think, is a good thing for a book of its kind. It 
	indicates that some areas that she wrote about have progressed, moved ahead; 
	that these issues demand a reappraisal in the altered landscape of our 
	social, political and cultural reality. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">At the 
	same time it's true that the revolutionary way of looking at ourselves, our 
	bodies, that we learnt from her, the exigencies of the good girl-bad girl 
	divide, is still, I think, as appropriate and needed in today's Bangladesh 
	as it was two decades ago when I was a teenager. Women still chat on shallow 
	shangsharik issues, girls still judge each other, themselves and boys at 
	levels superficial such as clothes, appearance, money -- and men continue to 
	remain boys (too) late into life. But here, perhaps, I over-generalize.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">Yet those 
	are the kinds of over-the-top statements which made me both adore and 
	disagree with Taslima Nasrin so strongly. Taslima's writing then and now is 
	not the place to seek sociological analysis, intellectual conceptualization, 
	a true representation of the state of things or the state of womanhood in 
	Bangladesh or South Asia. Her value resides in how jubilantly she flung open 
	doors that had been shuttered by genteel conservatism, by niceness, by 
	ignorance and denial, to clear the way for understanding and discussion of 
	issues that so desperately needed to be addressed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">Yet the 
	question begs to be asked: is that enough anymore? For someone who has 
	gained Taslima's stature, someone who had come to represent a certain face 
	of Bangladesh, she seems curiously oblivious to the nuances or the politics 
	of her situation. Her pop-shot remarks, “Before me, women would write love 
	stories or advice on childcare and cooking.” (interview with Irshad Manji, 
	2002); “I don't find any difference between Islam and Islamic 
	fundamentalists.” (interview with 'Free Enquiry' magazine), her not 
	acknowledging how her warped upbringing in a severely dysfunctional family 
	shaped her as a person, her discounting the efforts of countless men and 
	women within Bangladesh who hid and spirited her out of the country during 
	volatile times, who protested at the mindless injustice of her exile -- none 
	of these attributes serve to heighten our sense of her dependability and 
	veracity either as a writer or as a social reformer. Not to mention the 
	allegations of pandering to certain tastes in the marketing of her books 
	(can one not think of Amar Meyebela being translated/re-titled as Meyebela: 
	My Bengali Girlhood: A Memoir of Growing Up Female in a Muslim World by her 
	Western publisher?), a charge which she dismisses offhand. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">Are these 
	instances of naiveté or artifice? The banalities with which she faced Karan 
	Thapar in last year's Devil's Advocate interview, especially in her evasion 
	of his succinct questioning of her personal ethics in “compromising third 
	parties” gives one pause. In this interview -- as well as in others -- this 
	woman who is so soft-spoken in person bulldozes her way through discussion 
	and debate through simply stating a monosyllabic positive or negative, or a 
	single sentence that is essentially no more than sloganeering and sticking 
	to it no matter what. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">In some 
	respects Taslima seems as uncompromising and rigid as the mollas she 
	opposes. But does this ideological inflexibility come across as strength of 
	purpose? Or as a stubborn refusal to take into consideration a viewpoint 
	that differs even slightly than her own version of truth? Her truth seems to 
	have lost it's Bengali small town beginnings in recent years; despite her 
	claims to the contrary, her truth seems to have acquired a capital T, 
	transforming itself into an inalienable, transfixed Truth. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">
	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">Taslima's 
	discounting of her writerly lineage, of collectivity in the context of 
	Bangladeshi feminism and -- more hurtful perhaps to women not directly 
	related to either academia or the writing community -- the impassive denial 
	of any experience that belies her own diminishes her. Yes, abusive, 
	transgressive sexual practices are often the lot of girl children, 
	brutalizing fathers/father figures are not rare, nor are women who find 
	aberrant religious practices the only recourse to the crises of life. But 
	are these the only norms of Bangladeshi society? I myself grew up in a 
	fairly liberal family, my mother a professional woman, my father not given 
	to deciding our lives for us. Yet if I extrapolate my own experiences to 
	pronounce on the “normal” lives of all middle-class Bangladeshi families, I 
	do a disservice not only to myself but to others as well. And if my stated 
	aim of writing is to “change society,” I place myself in an even more 
	contentious position. </font></p>

	And yet I cannot help but remember. I remember walking through the Boi Mela 
	gate arm in arm with other young girls so would-be molesters got no chance 
	to jostle and molest us at the overcrowded gates. I remember the anger 
	shaking me as I held a college friend weeping as she described how her old 
	chacha had raped her for years and her parents had refused to believe her 
	when she told. I remember marching in rallies at Dhaka University to support 
	the anti-rape movement in Jahangirnagar. I remember walking into Boi Mela, 
	Gausia market, Gulistan with opened up large-size safety pins to stick into 
	male hands daring to come near our breasts, our buttocks. I remember staying 
	up late munching chanachur-makha, trading stories and laughter on how we had 
	and how we could deal with remarks, leers, invasive hands in public and 
	private places. </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">There 
	were others who helped, other writers, other activists, other women -- women 
	who worked, walked the streets, who cooked, cleaned, and taught us what it 
	meant to be female, what potential that word had. And there was Taslima. Who 
	stormed the barricades of bhodro feminist discourse, with her graphic 
	detailing of abuse, her unflinching depiction of the eternal exile of being 
	an articulate, affirmative woman, who suffered no injustice gladly. Taslima 
	was right when she said “woman has no country” -- this was true for her 
	perhaps even before she was forced into exile; at some level, true for the 
	rest of us as well. </font></p>

	This essay is not just about Taslima Nasrin. This essay is about me. This 
	essay is also about Farah, who I am honored to call my friend because she 
	once grabbed and displayed a male hand in a crowded London tube to ask, 
	“Does anyone know who this hand belongs to? Because I just found it on my 
	tit!”; about the tiny but wonderfully feisty Shilpi from Bangladesh-Kuwait 
	Maitree Hall who once took her shoe off and jumped up repeatedly to smack 
	the cheek of the tall old man who had touched her butt on the New Market 
	overbridge; and the young women who organized the “stoning” of a man who 
	would come to stand on the boundary wall at the back of Bangladesh-Kuwait 
	Maitree Hall to flash the residents. This essay is about the beginnings of 
	courage, the glimmerings of hope, of understanding that although for some of 
	us gender is destiny, gender need not be all of destiny. </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#333333">Books 
	have always been very important to me -- too important some would say. There 
	were books that I read and reread simply for the beauty of what they had to 
	say, for the sheer joy of the words; books that opened my mind and my heart 
	to new ideas, different ways of thinking, to the very process of thinking 
	itself. I felt such admiration for these, that they spawned within me a 
	lifelong ambition to be a writer myself. And there were books that impacted 
	me so deeply as a person that what they aroused within me was simply a sense 
	of abiding personal gratitude. </font></p>

	Nirbachito Kolum set off fireworks at various levels, in spaces both public 
	and intensely private. For me it was a connection between my reading and my 
	everyday lived life -- a bridge spanning the wild waters of tradition, 
	culture and community and the relatively rational shores of a mind that 
	rejected unexamined acceptance of conventionalities. It was from that book 
	that I -- and so many others my age -- first learnt in terms that we could 
	relate to that our bodies and our urges were not things to be ashamed of, 
	that the words we spoke, how we related to the world and the world to us 
	were gendered down to the minutest detail. Taslima Nasrin wrote in 
	Nirbachito Kolum, “I know that my path is not smooth. I have to walk 
	removing stones in the way. Not only me, so does every woman.” Despite our 
	disenchantment, disappointment and dashed hopes, there are those of us who 
	forever hold close to our hearts the moments when Taslima helped us remove 
	some of the stones littering our paths.</font></p>
