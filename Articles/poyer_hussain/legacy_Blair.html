											<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">
											It is well known that during his 
											first months in office, in 1997, 
											Tony Blair’s approval ratings were 
											higher than any other former Prime 
											Minister, but also that during the 
											latter stages of his premiership 
											Blair had the misfortune of having 
											the lowest approval ratings. Why 
											such a dramatic change in public 
											opinion?<br>
											<br>
											Here is how the story began…</span></i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">It is hard 
	to believe Blair ever considered himself a socialist, supporting the 
	campaign for unilateral nuclear disarmament, fighting against the threat to 
	civil liberties, opposing capital punishment. In all honesty I always had a 
	sneaking suspicion that he was in actual fact an undercover agent for the 
	conservatives to ruin the Labour party from within! If that is the case his 
	mission may be deemed a success by his superiors, job well done. Anyway this 
	was in fact the case for the early part of his career, and it is most likely 
	this so-called enthusiasm and the abhorrent word that many used to describe 
	Blair, <b>CHARISMA</b>,<b><span style="color:fuchsia"> </span></b>that 
	ensured his rapid rise in the hierarchy of the Labour Party. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:28.35pt">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">After the 
	death of John Smith in 1994, a race for the leadership ensued, and 
	subsequently Tony Blair won the leadership election in a three way battle, 
	and later went on to win the general election. While it is true that Labour 
	love to revel in past glories of the 1997 election which was won in such a 
	dramatic fashion, the famous image of the labour members dancing bizarrely 
	on stage to their campaign song ‘things can only get better,’ have they? I 
	don’t think anyone else has noticed. Anyway the reason for there 
	overwhelming victory was more to do with the Conservatives and Major’s sheer 
	incompetence, then Labours ridiculous attempt to reinvent themselves in the 
	new media era. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:28.35pt">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Following 
	this famous landslide victory there was an appearance of great fervour in 
	undoing the fundamental mistakes of the previous government, and there 
	seemed to be a real intent for change and modernisation to the old ways of 
	politics. Such as in the case for Constitutional reform and in particular 
	reforming the House of Lords which in recent years came to the forefront of 
	British politics. But even as these promises in the manifesto started its 
	initial stages there was often an uncertainty as to its approach, and more 
	specifically a lack of direction and end goal. After the House of Lords Act 
	was passed in 1999, the quantity of hereditary peers was dramatically 
	reduced by 90%. But as to its ultimate goal, there was a sense of 
	indecisiveness as to whether the members of the House would be elected or 
	nominated and other such detail. The end result came to a compromise that 
	was far from the radical proposals initially set out by the Labour Party.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:28.35pt">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Looking at a 
	positive aspect of Blair’s premiership is his role in assisting the Northern 
	Ireland Peace Process by helping to negotiate The Good Friday Agreement, 
	which he is commonly attributed and commended for. This was an immense 
	achievement for there was a deep and intertwining history of violence which 
	back dated to the 1800s.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:28.35pt">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;After 
	Labour’s second success in the General Election, in 2001, Tony Blair made 
	yet more promises that he could not fulfil, promising a revolutionary I.T 
	system for the NHS. The reality of the situation is that the entire cost of 
	the project was under-quoted, and overspent on a useless system that does 
	not even fulfil basic requirements, let alone meet expectations of increased 
	efficiency within the NHS. In fact the project insists on providing 
	continuous headaches for the government, one official even claiming that 
	‘the National Programme for IT in the NHS is currently sleepwalking towards 
	disaster<sup>1</sup>.’ Tony Blair’s greatest mistake was his eagerness to 
	get this system up and running, rather than listening to informed advisers 
	as to the possible problems that could arise. The question that Tony Blair 
	eagerly asked was <b>when</b> this system could be implemented, not <b>if</b> 
	it could be implemented, and <b>what</b> may be the problems faced whilst 
	implementing the system, this was his ultimate undoing.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:28.35pt">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">The 
	notorious relationship with George W. Bush was most likely an immense 
	contributor to Tony Blair’s downfall. Blair had a very good relationship 
	with the previous president, Clinton, which many thought could not be 
	equalled let alone surpassed, although America and Britain would always have 
	a good working relationship. But Blair’s loyalty became such that he was 
	often criticised for allowing Bush to be his puppet master. This personal 
	alliance came to the public’s eye when the so-called ‘War on Terror’ began 
	with the War in Afghanistan. Blair showed his support in America’s foreign 
	policy, sending troops into Afghanistan in 2001, who are still continuing to 
	fight a battle that they thought they had previously won. As there could be 
	some justification and argument for invading Afghanistan, there was no such 
	clear excuse that could be used for Iraq; this became abundantly clear with 
	the series of information that seeped through after the War began. The 
	‘Dodgy Dossier’ was subjected to spin and in fact plagiarised from a number 
	of sources or changed somewhat to present a more extreme view of 
	circumstances. &nbsp;This damming evidence that came to light was naturally 
	destructive for Blair’s career as a PM, which was the real starting point of 
	declining approval ratings, and mistrust within the general public, as it 
	was an example of a PM blatantly caught in the act. &nbsp;Later when the Hutton 
	Report came out this did not help matters, but was not an out and out 
	criticism of the government as some might have hoped. After this supposed 
	crookedness from the&nbsp; Labour Party they never seemed to really get away from 
	scandal. Who said politics was ever tedious, well certainly not during those 
	few years of British politics.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:28.35pt">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">In February 
	2004 Labour disassociated themselves with the RMT (National Union of Rail, 
	Maritime and Transport Workers),<b> </b>who were in part the founder of the 
	Labour Party. It was traditionally a working mans party and was founded for 
	the specific reason of representation in parliament for the working class 
	which was previously non existent, but certain policies which seemed ever 
	from the right wing such as privatisation of the healthcare sector and 
	education were the reason for growing hostility between the two parties. 
	Consequently ‘New’ Labour had been made more accessible to the masses and as 
	a result severely compromising its ideological integrity.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:28.35pt">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">In the 
	latter stages of Blair’s premiership the ‘cash for honours’ scandal did not 
	help his already declining public image, which was already a somewhat steep 
	drop, and which threatened to take a vertical turn further downwards. Labour 
	was accused of accepting donations that were not on the books by certain 
	members of the business community, who then were rewarded by nominations for 
	a peerage. It must be noted that no one was formally charged, but the fact 
	that even the PM was questioned regarding the matter reflects the 
	seriousness of the accusations, as this was a precedence in British 
	Politics.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:28.35pt">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">It is said 
	by his close friends that during the latter stages in office Blair became 
	obsessed with his legacy. So he may be glad to know that he will be a figure 
	that stands the test of time historically, but not quite as he intended. On 
	the other hand looking at Blair’s statistics some of his amazing 
	achievements must be mentioned, however grudgingly, leading Labour to 
	victory on three consecutive elections, and the longest running PM in recent 
	years are no achievements to be overlooked. He was a very successful orator 
	and flourished during PMQs (Prime Minister Questions that are held in 
	parliament every Wednesday), particularly during the early years of his 
	premiership. Blair stood by his policies and decisions no matter how 
	unpopular they may have been with the general public or how miserably they 
	failed. Famous decisions include the Iraq and Afghanistan War, and the not 
	so famous include Top Up fees (Regarding University Tuition Fees). &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">So in 
	conclusion, my findings suggest and my gut instinct tells me that deep down 
	he may possibly perhaps be a decent enough human being, and may have been 
	delusional enough to actually believe that morally, he carried out the 
	correct actions. As to his legacy, it is a shame for Blair that history 
	tends to look at the defining events of a PM’s premiership, which in his 
	case will undoubtedly be the Iraq War. Someone once said that <b><i>
	“Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it, misdiagnosing it, 
	and then misapplying the wrong remedies,”</i></b> this may just be Blair’s 
	philosophy, at least unconsciously. </span></p>
