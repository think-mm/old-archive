											[First I would like to tell the 
											reader somewhat about myself, in 
											order to comprehend my views and 
											perspective of this book. Normally I 
											would not do this, but I thought it 
											was required for this specific book 
											due to its topic. I am currently a 
											university student, and although my 
											parents are both Bangladeshi, I was 
											born and raised in London my entire 
											life. So when I found a novel 
											regarding the 1971 war in English an 
											intrigue immediately grew, about a 
											subject that is close to the heart, 
											I simply had to find out more. 
											Obviously I have never experienced 
											this event first hand, so all my 
											knowledge of it is through oral 
											stories and articles. -P.H.A.]</span></font></p>
											<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none">
											<font face="Verdana"><font size="4">
											<span style="color: black">T</span></font><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">he 
											story is about a family consisting 
											of a mother and her two children, 
											their father dying when they were 
											relatively small. The story 
											primarily concentrates on how, for 
											all intents and purposes an everyday 
											mother performs remarkable acts of 
											heroics during the war for the sake 
											of her children. This story is an 
											example of the countless daring acts 
											carried out during the war by those 
											who had previously lived a routine 
											life.<br>
											<br>
											Simply attempting to write a novel 
											concerning this subject is 
											ambitious, and although I’m still 
											not quite sure what to make of the 
											end result, there were certainly 
											aspects of the novel that I truly 
											admired.<br>
											<br>
											The story told is by no means an 
											epic but this was not the intent, I 
											think its intended purpose and 
											something that immediately 
											reverberated after reading the book, 
											was the sense that this was not a 
											fabricated story but we as a reader 
											were being told a tragic piece of 
											history, actual fact, about the 
											accounts of this family in 1971.<br>
											<br>
											Something that may have slightly 
											distracted the English reader but 
											which I revelled in was the 
											occasional dropping of Bangla words, 
											which in a sense validated the 
											entire novel for me. This technique 
											was done in such an implicit way, in 
											places where the reader could assume 
											the meaning of words with a little 
											common sense. What was really 
											apparent was the extent and sheer 
											volume of research that went behind 
											the creation of the novel; this was 
											partly the reason for such a 
											realistic picture of the war and the 
											country.<br>
											<br>
											</span><b>
											<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">
											As I picked up the novel each time 
											to read I had a sense of being 
											transported to Bangladesh, 
											particularly when the characters 
											traveled through well known places, 
											such as Mirpur Road, Danmondi Road, 
											Neelkhet Road etc.</span></b><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black"> 
											A small technique that was used but 
											that was extremely effective was the 
											Radio Broadcastings; I particularly 
											loved the inclusion of the renowned 
											speech broadcasted on the night of 
											the 26</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt; color: black">th
											</span>
											<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black">
											of March by Major Zia on behalf of 
											Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the national 
											leader, which gave the story a real 
											gravity, immediacy for action, and 
											so a rationale for the events that 
											followed.<br>
											<br>
											The infrequent inclusion of BBC 
											radio reminded me of a story told to 
											me with reference something that 
											became a ritual for families at 
											night during these uncertain times. 
											They would gather together huddled 
											up with the radio on, and the sound 
											as low as possible, listening 
											intently to any information provided 
											regarding the progression of the 
											war. Such as the previous example I 
											was often reminded of various 
											stories told to me concerning the 
											events of the war while reading this 
											book. Again it is clear to see the 
											research carried out for the book as 
											it is an accurate portrayal of the 
											events.<br>
											<br>
											The book gives the impression of 
											trying to include as much as 
											possible to inform the reader of 
											what took place, such as the ethnic 
											cleansing of Hindus, the rape of 
											countless women by the Pakistani 
											army, the massacre of Dhaka 
											University, the collaboration of 
											Jamaat and a small number of other 
											Islamic groups with the Pakistani 
											army. Even the conditions of the 
											camp in India where many 
											Bangladeshi’s came to reside to 
											escape the atrocities of the war 
											were integrated into the story. So 
											for this reason it is certainly an 
											excellent starting point for those 
											who wish to know and are totally 
											ignorant on the 1971 war, but do not 
											have the patience for a factual 
											book.<br>
											<br>
											In today’s examples of modern 
											literature it’s certainly satisfying 
											to find an author worth looking out 
											for, as I’m curious to see what the 
											style and subject of Tahmima Anams 
											next novel will be.</span></font></p>
