	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
	Dear Ms Nondini Hussain,&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I am highly impressed 
	by your brave and well documented Bengali article named
	<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/nondini/bikolangoNari.html">
	Purush Rochita Dharme Bikalanga Nari</a>, published in the 
	www.mukto-mona.com. You have correctly identified the most vulnerable and 
	dehumanized position of women in Islam. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">It is true that in 
	every religion the position of women is more or less degraded. But in Islam 
	it is worst and most wretched. In fact, since its inception Islam has been 
	waging a relentless Jihad against women. And it is extremely cruel, 
	deceptive and hypocritical in this regard.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In this respect, 
	Hinduism may be compared to Islam. But Hinduism is more a social system 
	based on traditions than a religious faith or doctrine. And most 
	importantly, it is not monotheistic and thereby monolithic. Divers and 
	conflicting ideas and systems are incorporated in it. So it may be 
	difficult, but may not be that much difficult to bring change or reform 
	there. But the same is not true for Islam.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Islam is absolutely a 
	monotheistic religion and thereby it has created a monolithic mind and 
	society. The religious commandments are clearly stated and unchangeable. It 
	is not a religion like Christianity which is not absolutely monotheistic 
	like Islam, because there is division of power between God and Jesus Christ, 
	the founder of the religion. According to the faith of Christianity till the 
	Day of Judgment the entire authority over heaven and earth is bestowed upon 
	Christ, and in the Day of Judgment not God but Christ himself will judge 
	human beings for their sins and virtues. And Islam is not a religion like 
	Buddhism which has no place for the idea of God, heaven and hell. So the 
	problems of women in Islam deserve special consideration, as they are unique 
	in many respects. &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Your article has 
	special significance to me, since I believe that the liberation of women is 
	the key to the liberation of human mind in any Muslim society and thereby 
	liberation of the Muslim society as well.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">However, we should 
	look at the problems of women in Islam from not only religious or 
	philosophical perspective, but also from political one. And it is easily 
	understandable that Islam is not only a social, but also at the same time a 
	political religion, and Mohammad used religion to establish his political 
	authority as well as a state that the Arabs lacked during the time. In order 
	to achieve his goal he organized the fanatic armed nomadic barbarians as the 
	striking force. Thus came aggressive wars, plunder, rape, slaves, concubines 
	– all justified by the commandments of religion. Since its birth ocean of 
	tears and blood has flowed to appease hunger and wrath of Allah, the idea 
	about the omnipotent, the most magnificent and merciful one.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The legacy continues 
	in a changed world with changed conditions. However, the world may change, 
	but the degradation and humiliation of woman remain unchanged, because the 
	religion demands so.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Thus the politics 
	against woman introduced by Mohammad still continues. Why this politics was 
	introduced, what is its effect and what is its role in perpetuating the all 
	pervasive despotism in a society under the faith of Islam is of extreme 
	importance to understand. Without having answers to these questions it is 
	impossible to pave the way for the uninterrupted development of any Muslim 
	country. Since under Islam no society can generate rational, independent and 
	creative mind, it fails to develop any new thing from within or 
	independently. So, the western countries easily dominate over the Muslim 
	world. That is why the western world and especially the U.S. are so much 
	interested to preserve religion here. They may dislike militant Islam, which 
	is directed against them with destructive power, but they are very much fond 
	of the moderate Islam, which externally may not dare to challenge their 
	domination and exploitation due to its impotency, but internally is no less 
	ferocious and offensive against woman and free thinking. So, in this respect 
	we must realize the politics of the West also.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Since the problem of 
	woman in Islam is essentially a political problem, the problem must also be 
	understood in political terms i.e., from the context of power and must also 
	be solved politically. According to me, the solution lies in the 
	establishment of separate and equal political power for women in every 
	respect of the state and society. So, women will exercise power over the 
	state and society as a separate entity from men, but with equal rights and 
	status.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">We should realize that 
	the thought process that leads women to the utterly degraded and enslaved 
	position originates from the concept of absolute oneness, and thereby 
	absolute unity of society. It decries any kind of division of power. 
	Absolute concentration of power in one centre i.e., in one hand is its goal. 
	As it is the only way to attain absolute unification. In Islam the absolute 
	unifying element is a man with sword and whip. A single man must be the 
	absolute authority over all others. This concept is philosophically 
	manifested in Islam in the declaration of the absolute oneness and supremacy 
	of Allah, the idea of a single creator and ruler of the universe i.e., the 
	supreme power.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The very concept of La 
	Shareek Allah is compatible with the absolute subjugation and powerlessness 
	of women in society. Allah is the creation of man’s mind. So, through the 
	idea of Allah man sees his own supremacy and singularity. In fact, the very 
	idea of an absolute and supreme One derives from his (in this case 
	Mohammad’s) desire to place woman, his primary counter-part, and then all 
	others under his absolute subjugation. But the existence of woman as a 
	separate entity exposes the hollowness of the idea. It reminds him of the 
	fact that singularity is not the whole truth and duality is another truth of 
	nature. Man is only one half of the total and woman is another half. So, 
	truth also may be equally divided or separated.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Thus recognition of 
	woman as a separate and equal entity shatters the idea of absolute 
	singularity or oneness. The existence of woman always shows the 
	incompleteness of man as a human being. So, the solution to him becomes the 
	expulsion of women from social life.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">But not only for 
	philosophical or ideological reason women had to be expelled. There was 
	another reason that was practical in nature. Women are basically a pacifying 
	force. But Islam chose mainly the path of war or violence to expand. So, it 
	had to give highest emphasis on inspiring violent instincts of men so that 
	they could fight with all vigor for establishing Mohammad’s temporal and 
	religious domain. When war and coercion decide everything, what can women do 
	there? They no longer remain subjects, but become objects to satisfy the 
	appetite of the aggressive, armed, plundering, violent, and rapist males. In 
	this situation women must retreat from social life as far away as possible 
	and take shelter within the walls of the house.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On the other hand, the 
	culture of systematic and permanent war and violence demands expulsion of 
	women from social life as women are not suitable for nurturing physical 
	violence like men. Their physiology and nature do not allow them generally 
	to be as violent and warlike as men. So, their active and effective role in 
	the society hinders the growth of any perpetual and all pervasive system of 
	warfare and violence. Since the expansion of Islam was based mainly on 
	continuous warfare in the name of Jihad, women had to be expelled from the 
	visible social life and pushed into the dark chamber of society where they 
	remained invisible from outside.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In Islam the 
	relationship between Allah and Satan, in fact, reflects its conceived 
	relationship between man and woman in the life process. So, Allah represents 
	the idea of man and Satan represents the idea of woman. A careful study of 
	the Qur-an and Hadith clearly leads us to this conclusion. In some Hadiths 
	women have been equated with Satan in terms. So, the idea of man represents 
	goodness and that of woman represents badness. However, woman in Islam is a 
	necessary evil, without whom the existence of man would have been 
	impossible. Similarly, Satan is also indispensable to Allah to play His 
	despotic game with mankind. Thus duality and thereby multiplicity of nature 
	are recognized in religion also, but in a wrong and perverted form. So all 
	qualities bestowed upon God i.e. upon one entity and all vices bestowed upon 
	Satan i.e. upon another entity. This kind of judgment forgets or denies the 
	argument that since God is the creator of Satan, so it itself becomes the 
	creator or the supreme and ultimate source of all vices or sins of Satan. So 
	what difference remains between God and Satan? Do not they represent the two 
	sides of a single entity? But religion denies rationality.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In this thought 
	process truth is absolute and indivisible one. So, in the absolute sense, 
	one is either good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, right or wrong, black 
	or white. So any difference with the authority is Satanic. No comparative or 
	relative judgment works here. In the thought process there is no separation 
	or division of power. Everything is unipolar, unilineal, unicentric. So, 
	there is no reasoning, no tolerance and no dialectic. In this context, 
	Islamic mind cannot operate freely. That is why the entire Islamic world is 
	mentally obstructed.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Islamic mind is an 
	aggressive and absolutist man’s mind. Islamic world is an aggressive and 
	absolutist man’s world. As women are the most destructive elements for this 
	mind and world order, they cannot have honorable and visible place here. So, 
	in order to crush this mind and world order men will have to be forced to 
	accept the position of women with the separate entity and equal status in 
	every sphere of life. Thus the emancipation of the mind under Islam lies in 
	the recognition of the fact that despite belonging to the same species women 
	constitute a separate entity from men. Women and men may have equal role in 
	building society and civilization, but nature has made them different in 
	many respects. So, their role is also not the same in all respects. But both 
	are equally indispensable for the survival of the human species as well as 
	building civilization. Furthermore, we must realize that the relation 
	between man and woman is the most basic or primary social relation. So, it 
	has formidable role in shaping the mind and body of any society.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In order to make the 
	mind under Islam rational the establishment of women’s political power is 
	essential. It is the only way to make the society tolerant. Women are 
	inherently more tolerant than men. Nature has made them so. So, society will 
	learn tolerance from them more easily. Besides, man will learn that he is 
	not the sole proprietor of this universe and there is an independent 
	counterpart to co-operate and compete with him with equal status in every 
	sphere of life. This material or social ground by the division of power 
	between man and woman will pave the way for the development of mental 
	faculties.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Philosophical or 
	ideological struggle is, of course, necessary. Some people should do it. But 
	how many people will become truly secular or atheist in this society, where 
	everybody is supposed to be the slave or Banda of Allah? Practically, it is 
	a slave society. By the commandments of religion everybody is a slave of the 
	system which is opposed to any form of freedom, not to speak of free 
	thinking, and based upon extreme form of tyranny or despotism.&nbsp; Where the 
	vast majority of the people cannot think even and do not tolerate different 
	ideas and are extremely fatalist and fearful of the imaginative supernatural 
	supreme authority, how can we expect them to fight against superstition and 
	religion? Who cares for free thinking here? Those who actually care, what is 
	their number? To speak against religion may be dangerous here. After so many 
	years how many educated people even know the name of Araj Ali Matubbar, the 
	great philosopher of this soil? Under the pressure of the vast masses of the 
	people no free thinking can thrive here. No progressive force can penetrate 
	roots deep under the surface of the social soil.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">So, the only way I see 
	is to establish a political system where women will exercise their own power 
	over the state and society as equal partners of men. Thus the very 
	foundation of the unicentric thought process manifested through the 
	declaration of La Shareek Allah (God has no partner) will collapse.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">That is why western 
	type of democracy and electoral system can give no solution to our problems. 
	In the statecraft men and women are in a simple way equally treated there. 
	So, in the power structure of the West women have no special rights and 
	privileges in recognition of their special and unique role in the 
	procreative and rearing process of the human species. But their conditions 
	are different from ours. Even many aspects of their religion and culture are 
	vastly different from ours. So our problems deserve different solutions.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Without realizing this 
	reality the imitation of the western democracy and electoral system has 
	failed not only to uplift the conditions of women to any considerable 
	extent, but also to establish a truly secular and democratic society and 
	state in any Muslim country. The rule with the support of the majority 
	voters has only led to the gradual deterioration of the conditions of the 
	people, in general, and women, in particular, almost everywhere in the 
	Muslim world. And most miserable remain or become the conditions of women. 
	Since they are the mothers of humanity, no society with human values can 
	thrive here. Their subhuman conditions compel them to give birth only to a 
	subhuman or dehumanized society. So we are in need of the establishment of 
	women’s own power in the statecraft.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
	<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Thus only women’s 
	power, the establishment of women in the realm of state and society as a 
	separate and equal entity can liberate the mind from the shackle of 
	religion, create the space for reasoning and free the society from mental 
	retardation. The old world of male domination, supported by religion and all 
	other arrangements, will collapse. So this will be a new kind of social 
	revolution in the history of mankind. Let us fight for that. </span></p>
