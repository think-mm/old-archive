<p>Dear Dr. Ajit P. Yoganathan </p>
<p>I saw your ad in the Net for the open&nbsp; Post-Doctoral Positions in 
Cardiovascular Biomechanics Laboratory in Whitaker Department of Biomedical 
Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. I am at the very last stage of 
my Phd program in Mechanical Engineering with the concentration in Bio-medical 
engineering in National University of Singapore. I have a very strong 
professional and academic background in Biomedical research with Mechanical and 
IT experience. I have been working with Prof. Wieslaw.L Nowinski, the director 
of Biomedical imaging lab at the Institute for Infocomm Research. By getting an 
opportunity to work in his Lab, I obtained an extensive R &amp; D experience in 
neuroinformetics, construction of anatomic and functional brain atlases, 
development of atlas based applications, FEM modelling, segmentation, 
visualization, registration etc. among others. </p>
<p>I was planning to move to Atlanta after finishing my PhD this year. I think 
my experience in Biomedical Engineering can greatly contribute to the 
Post-Doctoral positions you are offering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. I 
am attaching my resume for your kind consideration. Please let me know <b>
whether you would process H1 Work Visa</b> for any of the candidates. I will 
send you the references and other necessary documents if you think I would be 
eligible to apply for this position. </p>
<p>thanking&nbsp; you </p>
<p>Avijit Roy</p>
