<p>Dear Professor Farrokh Mistree </p>
<p>I saw your ad in the Net for the open positions in Savannah Campus Mechanical 
Engineering Department. I am at the very last stage of my Phd program in 
Mechanical Engineering with the concentration in Bio-medical engineering in 
National University of Singapore. I have a very strong professional and academic 
background in Information Technology as well as Mechanical/ Bio Engineering. I 
have a great passion for combining my engineering academic knowledge with the 
innovative Information technology experience I have gathered through my 
professional life. </p>
<p>I was planning to move to Atlanta after finishing my PhD this year. I think 
my experience in both IT and Mechanical Engineering can greatly contribute to 
the new signature program you are trying to build in Savannah campus. I am 
attaching my resume for your kind consideration. Please let me know whether you 
would process H1 Work Visa for any of the candidates. I will send you the 
references and other necessary documents if you think I would be eligible to 
apply for this position. </p>
<p>thank you </p>

have a very strong professional and academic background in Bioengineering, 
Mechanical Engineering as well as Information Technology. I have a great passion 
for combining my mechanical engineering academic knowledge with the innovative 
fields of Bioengineering that I have gathered through my professional life. In 
my latest project, I was engaged in conducting experimental and numerical 
analysis of various biological tissues and other porous media. Thus, I think I 
do meet the required skills mentioned in the job description. </p>
<p>I was planning to move to Atlanta after finishing my PhD this year. I think 
my experience in both Bioengineering and Mechanical Engineering can greatly
