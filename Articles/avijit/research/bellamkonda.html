<title>Hi Dr</title>

<p>Hi Dr. Bellamkonda</p>
<p>Your research in&nbsp; the area of&nbsp; brain, its mechanical properties and 
characterize the mechanical effect on neural tissue (for e.g&nbsp; 
micro-electrodes by using FEM) compelled me to write few lines to you. </p>
<p>I am currently pursuing PhD in National University of Singapore and almost at 
the end of my period.&nbsp; I have developed a fine finite element human brain 
model (3D) with detailed anatomical information based on Cerefy Brain Atlas 
(which is arguably one of the best atlases available in the market). A nonlinear 
hyper-viscoelastic mechanical property typically suited for neurosurgery 
simulation has been incorporated thereafter and it is able to simulate the 
deformation for the entire brain and individual sub-cortical structures as well. 
I have also&nbsp; incorporated a visualization tool using Java 3D to deploy the 
model.</p>
<p>I have been working with Prof. Wieslaw.L Nowinski,&nbsp; the director of 
Biomedical imaging lab at the Institute for Infocomm Research. Having got an 
opportunity to working in his Lab, I obtained an extensive R &amp; D experience in 
neuroinformetics, construction of anatomic and functional brain atlases, 
developing atlas based applications, FEM modelling, segmentation, visualization, 
registration&nbsp; among others. Besides this I have several publication and 3 
years working experience as software engineer and production engineer. </p>
<p>I will be obliged if you kindly tell me whether I have any scope to apply in 
your Lab for Post Doc position or any other suitable position (next year). My CV&nbsp; 
can be sent later based on your kind response and your prior interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Avijit</p>
