<p>Dear Professor Mistree:</p>
<p>I was not sure whether I was really fit for the open faculty positions 
(mentioned in the advertisement), hence I asked for the suggestion before I was 
going to apply. Thanks for your kind advice. I have also gone through the 
attachments you sent. The reason why I was so interested to apply was it looked 
like a very exciting mission where I thought I could contribute a lot with my 
diverse experience in IT and ME. I am summarizing my expertise below: </p>
<p>Please see the following reasons why I think I can help this new program to a 
great extent: </p>
<p>- I have a rare combination of practical and academic experience in 
Information Technology, Mechanical Engineering and Bio-engineering which can 
help the students prepare for the real life industry challenges. </p>
<p>- I also posses a strong background in JAVA which is a key programming tool 
for software design, mechanical engineering &amp; manufacturing product design, and 
various applications involving data security. </p>
<p>- With my academic and industry experience, I believe I can help the new 
faculty establish a strong Information technology system for the Mechanical 
Engineering department as well as create a advanced course syllabus by combining 
latest IT innovations in Bio engineering, and Mechanical Engineering field. </p>
<p>- With my Bio-engineering research background I can bring the touch of 
bio-engineering aspects to the ME program which seems to be a very demanding 
field in engineering now a days. </p>
<p>- I am also capable of building virtual design platforms needed for the 
students for distant learning, when required. </p>
<p>- I am very interested to pursue my career in teaching and research and work 
through a challenging environment to accomplish my goal which will help me grow.
</p>
<p>If you think my experiences and expertise will not be good enough for the 
current open faculty positions, please feel free to advise me for any other 
positions [if any], such as, post doctoral positions, etc in Georgia Tech. I 
would be honored to pursue my career with such a prestigious school like Georgia 
Tech. <br>
</p>
<p>Thanks for your support and advice. Hoping to hear back from you.</p>
