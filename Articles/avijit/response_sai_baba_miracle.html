<p>Ok, I am trying to put some rational thoughts on so-called &quot;miracle&quot; of ash 
formation from Sai-baba's picture etc. There are three kinds of explanation 
available in the market. Firstly, it is entirely possible that some followers 
are faking it (i.e spreading the story) to make themselves and their Saibaba 
&quot;great&quot; to the public (this glorification occasionally happens for the 
celebrities and religious gurus). Second explanation is - the top of the photo 
frame is made intentionally hollow and filled with vibhuti or ash, so vibhuti 
falls down time to time from the framed photographs of Satya Sai Baba.&nbsp; But 
third explanation is most logical. It says that Sai baba or their followers&nbsp; 
sprays lactic acid (crystal) on the glass frame of the picture prior to 
marketing. Lactic acid forms ash-like particles from the glass being exposed to 
air. If common people are not aware of&nbsp; the mystery (just chemical 
reaction) behind ash formation, they may get astonished. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Sai baba does another &quot;miracle&quot; quite often where he supposedly produce 
Vibhuti (or anything) from air or nowhere. Satya Sai Baba claim to create ash or 
anything from nothing by his divine power.&nbsp; In magical terms such trick is 
called as &quot;Palming&quot;. PC. Sarkar/ Jewel Aich frequently show such magic on 
stages, without claiming any supernatural divinity/miracle behind.&nbsp; I read 
a funny story in Sunday Times.&nbsp; P C Sarkar (junior) once visited Sai Baba's 
place in disguise, and Sai baba without recognizing him properly, created 
Bibhuti for him (as he do for other followers). P C Sarkar in return created a &quot;Roshgolla&quot; 
for Baba thru his magical tricks. Sai baba almost freaked out! Prabir Ghosh 
demystefied Sai baba in his &quot;Aloukik noy Loukik&quot; (1st part). There he wrote that 
Saibaba, most presumably hides a pouch under his armpit. A thin tube is attached 
to the pouch and travels all the way up to his palm. He produces ash by pressing 
the pouch for his followers which comes thru the tube to his hand. Mr. Ghosh 
also provided a detailed pencil sketch of the trick in the book.&nbsp; He also 
challenged Sai baba to perform the miracle in front of him, but quite expectedly 
- could not get any response from baba's part. Please go to the following link 
too to know how Sai baba was once caught faking on video :</p>
