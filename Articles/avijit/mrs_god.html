<p>Dear M RS: </p>
<p>The author (whoever it is) made some serious flaws from scientific point of 
view. Let me point out some those. But before that I would like to read last 
part of my &quot;Alo-Hate choliyachey Adharer Jatree&quot; in details. Most of the pints 
of the author raised I discussed&nbsp; in that part. You can find it here:</p>

<p>I have discussed the interesting topic more in detail in the printed version. 
The book will be published in next year &quot;ekushe-boi mela&quot; (February Book Fair), 
if everything goes in a right direction. I am not sure whether there are any 
other Bangla book&nbsp; right now in the market on this topic. If I find any, I 
will let you know. There are some books of Dr. Ali Asghar, Dr. M Akhtaruzzaman, 
but those are written from academic point of view ignoring the essential 
philosophical&nbsp; discussion.&nbsp; Anyways, let me point out the two 
erroneous notion of the author in brief. The rest you will find in the above 
link of my article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author states:</p>
<p>&gt; If we do exist, there are only two possible<br>
&gt; explanations as to how our existence came to be.<br>
&gt; Either we had a beginning or we did not have a<br>
&gt; beginning. The Bible says, &quot;In the beginning God<br>
&gt; created the heaven and the earth&quot; (Genesis 1 :1). The<br>
&gt; atheist has always maintained that there was no<br>
&gt; beginning.</p>
<p>The assumption is wrong. Atheism by definition,&nbsp; is characterized by an 
absence of belief in the existence of gods, it has nothing to do with beginning 
of universe, they way the author quoted. The theological significance of 
inflationary cosmology (which has been accepted by renowned physicists)&nbsp; is 
this: It shows how the universe can have formed from nothing, in complete chaos 
(maximum entropy), and have order form spontaneously, without violating any 
known principles of physics. That is, it provides an economical explanation of 
the origin of the universe without creation or design. A true&nbsp; scientist 
does not investigate the origin of universe&nbsp; to prove &quot;atheism&quot; or 
&quot;theism&quot;, rather he will go whatever way the data lead him. Currently, a 
Biblical creator (as the author insisted&nbsp; quoting Biblical verse) is not 
required by any scientific data.&nbsp; The author quoted selectively a verse 
from Bible, however entirely forgot that the biblical creation took six days, 
and has the sun and stars created after the earth, which has not been supported 
by any scientific facts or evidences. </p>
<p>Let me clarify more precisely. Universe had a beginning thru a Hot Big Bang 
which has been supported by current cosmological data. But that &quot;beginning&quot; does 
not require God. We have no miraculous &quot;beginning&quot; to time or the universe that 
needs God's intervention. It will take some space to discuss what scientists 
mean &quot;beginning&quot;, as no absolute point in time exists in the equations of 
physics suggested by the physicists. If you want to proceed I will discuss, 
however, be assured that it is quite different than those religious myths and 
propaganda. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; If we know the creation has a beginning, we are faced<br>
&gt; with another logical question_was the creation caused<br>
&gt; or was it not caused? The Bible states, &quot;In the<br>
&gt; beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&quot; Not<br>
&gt; only does the Bible maintain that there was a cause_a<br>
&gt; creation_but it also tells us what the cause was. It<br>
&gt; was God. The atheist tells us that &quot;matter is<br>
&gt; self-existing and not created.&quot; If matter had a<br>
&gt; beginning and yet was uncaused, one must logically<br>
&gt; maintain that something would have had to come into<br>
&gt; existence out of nothing. From empty space with no<br>
&gt; force, no matter, no energy, and no intelligence,<br>
&gt; matter would have to become existent. Even if this<br>
&gt; could happen by some strange new process unknown to<br>
&gt; science today, there is a logical problem.</p>
<p>The statement has several flaws. Firstly,&nbsp; he is using the famous
<font face="Palatino, Latin"><i>Kaläm Cosmological Argument</i>:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<dl>
  <dd>(1) Whatever begins has a cause.</dd>
  <dd>(2) The universe began to exist.</dd>
  <dd>(3) Therefore, the universe has a cause.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) The cause is 
  God. </dt>
</dl>
<p>The first kaläm premise has been disputed long time ago on the basis of the 
non-causal nature of quantum phenomena. &quot;Whatever begins has a cause&quot; is not 
true for Quantum fluctuation. Physical bodies begin to exist all the time 
without cause. In the radioactive decay of an atomic nucleus, an alpha, beta, or 
gamma particle begins to exist spontaneously, without a cause. So,&nbsp; Not 
everything that begins has to have a Cause. The uncertainty principle allows 
energy (which is equivalent to mass by E=mc^2) to appear spontaneously&nbsp; as 
it disappears in a short-enough time. It is a proven fact. These evidences are 
enough to refute the authors claim. </p>
<p>The universe at the beginning of the big bang was a subatomic particle, so 
universe can be created with an uncaused quantum fluctuation that led to 
inflation which afterwards proceeded the appearance of matter and structure. 
Edward Tryon was the first to publish this idea in major journals in 1973.&nbsp; 
With appearance of the inflationary cosmology in 80's, several physicists 
developed models in which inflation is triggered by an initial quantum event.&nbsp; 
Here are some: David Atkatz and Heinz Pagels, &quot;Origin of universe as Quantum 
Tunneling effect&quot; Physical review D25 (1982): 2065-73; S.W. Hawking and I.G.Moss 
&quot;Supercolled Phase Transitions in the very early Universe&quot;, Physics letters 
B110(1982):35-38; Alexander Vilenkin, &quot;Creation of Universe from Nothing&quot; 
Physics letters 117B (1982) 25-28, Andre Linde, &quot;Quantum creation of the 
inflamatory Universe,&quot; Letter Al Nuovo Cimento 39(1984): 401-405 etc. I am not 
asking you read those technical papers right now, however, they should serve to 
illustrate here that serious attention to the possibility of an uncaused origin 
of the universe has been given by reputable physicists and published in major 
scientific journals. If the notion is non-sense, as claimed by the author of 
your article, or violated any laws of physics these paper would not have been 
published in scientific journals. </p>
<p>Final objection of such argument is that the argument concludes that a “god”&nbsp; 
(Biblical or whatever) exists, but if so, this god must have a cause (according 
to the same argument). This leads to an infinite regress of causes (gods) 
unacceptable to the theist, so most believers make an exception for their god, 
asserting that it doesn’t need a cause — but there is no obvious reason why this 
exception cannot be applied to the universe, too. If a god “just is,” why can’t 
the universe “just be?”</p>
<p>I am a bit short of time at this moment. I will respond to other portions 
later if deemed necessary. In the mean time You might want to read my above 
piece in Bangla. A chapter from Vic Stenger's book will also might helpful. He 
discussed more elaborately :</p>

<p>You might also check some of his other articles in MM author list. They are 
really illuminating. </p>
