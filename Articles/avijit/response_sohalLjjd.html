<p>Dear Sohal,</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback on my article. I will try to answer your enquiries.
</p>
<p><i>You said, &quot;in my case when i calss 9 student.. when our teacher teach us x 
or Y cromogom.. i feel some thing different,, my thing going up.. so if u make 
some more fee this sex for them,, they will be feel more about that,,,than they 
can do some thing wrong also.. &quot;</i></p>
<p>I think your experience clearly reveals the pathetic situation of the 
education system of our country. Your thing arose just by reading X-Y chromosome 
at class 9,&nbsp; just because, our childhood orientation is not habituated with 
such education. From class&nbsp; one to class eight we are kept in the dark 
about sex, and suddenly while we start reading such stuff in school at class 9, 
many of us get an erotic pleasure that they are reading &quot;pornography&quot;. Our 
teachers also feel ashamed to teach these stuff. But am sure, if you were taught 
properly about human anatomy, sex and psychology, you would not be bothered 
much! Please think, if proper &quot;education&quot; makes a student's stuff uplifted, then 
what about all the medical students? They even have to deal with naked dead body 
and need to learn every details of human anatomy, sexual behavior etc. Does it 
make them sexually offensive? No. So you see systematic education does not make 
a person pervert, but wrong-education does!</p>
<p><i>You said, &quot;do you thinnk proper education about sex can prevent sextual 
hargment. ?? u told about singapore,, here have proper aducation for sex,, thats 
why here don have ..molested or some thing... but i feel here have police..for 
that here girls very safe,, But one thing if you go orchard road on X-mass night 
then u will see, 50,000 police force also cannot prevent molesting... &quot;</i></p>
<p>Before making any conclusion, we need to know why sex harassments occur in 
the first place. Male chauvinistic ego, sexual superiority&nbsp; complex, 
thinking women as commodity, frustration in young generation, mental sickness 
and disorder, law and order situation and many other things are involved. Not 
all the things can be handled by proper sex education, however some can. 
Actually I went to Orchard in X-mas nights and 31st night many times. I don't 
think the molestation was such alarming&nbsp; compared to BD situation. Forget 
about Boi-mela, Pahela-Boishak, Rock concert etc, even in normal daily life, 
girls are being molested in market place, Universities every where. </p>
<p>You enquired what type of sex education is needed. Though there are some 
dispute on this issue, here is an imprtant link you may want to check :</p>

<p>You said, &quot;in america or some other country they teaching there childen about 
proper sex... how many rap case is happening there??? why??&quot;</p>
<p>True there are incidents on child molestation, rape case etc, however 
normally people do not get afraid to report against those crimes. &quot;Raper kotha 
janle meyer aar biye hobe na&quot; - such situation never arises. Each and every 
country has its own problem. Anmerica is a capitalist country. Many thinks rape 
is an integral part of the capitalist system. Profits over people, aggression 
rather than compassion, and establishing control are the main tenets of 
capitalism. Of course capitalist society has some advantages which freedom 
loving US people enjoys;&nbsp; however, compared to socialist countries, women 
oppression, rape, molestation etc are high due to the very reason they created 
for themselves. The issue needs a socio-political explanation which will take 
time and space. we can discuss this some other time.</p>
