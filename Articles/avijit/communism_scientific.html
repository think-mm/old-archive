  <p>My intention was to engage in a debate with Ms. Hashem in a scholarly
  manner, not to respond a personal attack in any form. I read her last response
  which was targeted solely towards me, not my writing. Please check the word
  she used against me ..&quot;Capitalist&quot;, &quot;known Islam basher&quot;
  etc.</p>
  <p>I never said that I am a capitalist, neither I supported US atrocities for
  which I was blamed. In fact, I was one of the lonely voices among this group
  who did not support US invasion in Iraq and recently raised the issue of
  prisoner abuse by US soldier in MM. Please also read my Bangla article for
  reference:</p>
  <p><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/Disgusting_photos.pdf">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/Disgusting_photos.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Setara Hashem called me 'Capitalist', 'Islam basher' etc. for no/irrelevant
  reasons. The topic under discussion was not Islam, hence &quot;Islam
  bashing&quot; is misplaced. Again, It is a common misleading tendency among
  some (from among both apologists and those who regard themselves
  freethinkers:-)) to polarize critical views etc as being influenced by
  propaganda of vested quarters opposed to their dogma or party. Hence we have
  seen in the past critics of communism being portrayed as capitalists, critics
  of Islam dismissed as agents of Jewis/Christian/Hindu fanatic groups, critics
  of AL party as being Jamatis, critics of BNP/Jamat as Awamee-Bakshalee,
  critics of BJP as &quot;pseudo-secular&quot; etc. This naive simplistic
  bipolar frame of mind is not becoming of a freethinker with a rational and
  independent judgment of things. Perhaps, Ms. Hashem got agitated because I
  claimed Marxism as unscientific.</p>
  <p>There are a lot of reasons I raised in my article why I do think <b>Marxism
  is <font color="#FF0000">un</font>scientific</b>. I pointed those in some of my <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/16810">previous
  posts</a>. Whatever I
  write, I do not think I deserve any personal attack from her or anyone, for holding a
  different philosophy. It is really tough for me to continue a debate on such
  interesting topic if I am being attacked by name calling etc. If I am wrong,
  just show my flaws, that would be sufficient, I think. I would argue her (and
  others) to stick to the topic I raised. I was discussing about the atrocities
  made by communists, so pointing US atrocities in response does not invalidate
  my accusations. I am pretty aware of US atrocities, and I specified my
  position many times. Suppose America is bad, how you conclude that I am proven
  wrong in accusing communists? Your argument seems - &quot;See he (US) lies, so
  I (communist) will also lie&quot;. This is not an intelligent response, by any
  means. You have to prove your position right, rather than pointing to others.
  Anyways, Let's go to our discussion on Marxism directly.</p>
  <p>The essence of Marxist economics consists of showing that worker does not
  get a return in pay equal to the full 'value' which his labor contributes to
  the product, since part of the profit is retained by the capitalist. This had
  been pointed out by all the great economists. Marx's new point was to declare
  this retention of 'surplus value' illegitimate. The novelty was, therefore
  emotional (ethical) and social rather than economic/scientific.</p>
  <p>Marx's made some conclusion which he (and later his followers) thought to
  be scientific. For example, in first volume of <i>Das Kapital</i>, he argues
  that since profit accrues solely from the surplus value extracted from labor,
  the rate of profit will depend upon the proportion of the labor to fixed
  capital in the form of machinery and will therefore tend to fall as
  technological improvements lead to the employment of proportionately less
  labor. This was plainly untrue even at that time, and Marx himself finally
  noted the difficulty but set in aside for later treatment, which he never gave
  it.</p>
  <p>Again let's focus on the second 'law' Marx deduced. Marx concluded that the
  number of capitalists would contract, and as a country advanced economically
  under capitalism, it would increasingly polarize the into fewer and fewer
  capitalists and more and more proletarians. This too, fails completely as
  recognizable account of real evolution of the west and east Europe. It is
  obvious that Marx deduced his famous &quot;<i>law of increasing misery</i>&quot;
  emotionally (hypothetically), not scientifically - in which the more the
  capital invested and the greater the production the less will be the wages
  paid for labor. This has also proven to be false.</p>
  <p>The idea of his so-called 'scientific' theory of social change is central
  to Marx's whole system. He thought Capitalism is bound to collapse, not
  because it was undesirable but because the 'iron laws' of economic development
  proved that it was already - over century ago - a brake on the productive
  forces, so that under it the economy would be unable to expand. But facts
  proved other wise despite Marx thought it right. And his basic failure has
  naturally involved those Shetara Hasems who still call themselves Marxists in
  a cycle of errors.</p>
  <p>Ms. Shetara Hasem is claiming Marx's political theory as
  &quot;scientific&quot;. However, even the 'official' versions of Marxism now
  held, it contradicts one another in important ways. There are Leninists,
  Maoists, Trotskyists etc. and every communist thinks he is the
  &quot;true&quot; Marxist, and his version of communism is scientific. I have
  met some members of Ultra Marxist Group (underground) in BD, and they do not
  even consider the members of CPB, NAP etc are communists at all. Like the
  &quot;True Muslims/Jehadis&quot; there are some &quot;True Communists&quot;
  who still hold the spirit of violent revolution and justify their killing,
  crucifying of class enemies, while other &quot;moderate&quot; communists
  disagree with this extreme approach. This is a peculiar circumstances, and we
  need to examine the sense, if any, in which the Marxist thought can really be
  regarded as being on a level of scientific theory proper.</p>
  <p>Lets analyze Marxism in light of science, not 'scienticism'. A physicist
  would not call himself as a believer in &quot;Newtonism&quot; or &quot;Enstienism&quot;.
  This is simply because Newton's law of gravitation or Einstein's general and
  special theory of relativity etc. are already a part of science. In so far as
  these theories held, almost every physicist is indeed bound to accept those,
  no need to call them a believer of specific &quot;ism&quot;. Same goes to
  Biologists who accepts Darwinism as a theory as well as fact as long as they
  are all evolutionists. Any &quot;ism&quot; which is proven wrong has been
  rejected, so we know the fate of &quot;Lamarckism&quot;. Now, calling Marxism
  is scientific, leads us to&nbsp; bizarre extreme, because not all the leading
  Economists view it as scientific, not all prominent philosopher accepts this
  philosophy as scientific. I mentioned abut Bertrand Russell previously. In
  fact their are lot of other examples too. It can be scarcely maintained that
  Molotov and Aragon had deeper intelligences and stronger understandings of
  society and the universe than the great Western historians and philosophers
  who were their contemporaries. They were not Marxists. The inevitable answer
  is that they were temperamentally predisposed to accepting the teaching of
  Marx.</p>
  <p>Again, leading Marxist and Communist leaders had mostly been of bourgeois
  origin. Marx here admits that their motivations are not those normally
  provided for by Marxism. But what is it that determines that some bourgeois
  intellectuals should become Marxists while others do not? Shetara Hasem might
  want to come with a scientific explanation, perhaps?</p>
  <p>In fact, Marx's idea of a society which would ensure for everyone fair
  shares of the goods produced has not a &quot;new&quot; one, and had long been
  a unfulfilled dream in human insight. In some country, particularly Britain,
  has produced a large socialist party without much reference to special
  doctrine of Marx. Even, Dialectic Materialism, for which Marx will be
  remembered, is not his own creation. Ancient Greek Philosopher, Hiraclitas
  preached the same philosophy long time ago. Marx describes his system as
  arising from three sources - the philosophy of German Hegel, the economics of
  Richardo, ando other British economists, and the social theories of French
  Socialists like Saint-Simon.</p>
  <p>Ms. Hashem sees only few atrocities in Stalin's regime and she thinks those
  killings are well-justified. This is entirely dogmatic. All Stalin's massacres
  and oppressions were justified, in her mind because she believes them
  necessary in the long run to produce 'good society'. Thus a ruthless man's
  conscience may be at peace while he commits abominable crimes. But simple
  answer is that future 'good society' is hypothetical, and killing and
  sufferings are real.</p>
  <p>Hitler like many other dictator, spoke of himself as 'representing' the
  German people. In the same way, In Soviet Union, the communist Party and its
  leaders claimed to represent the working class, but there was no longer any
  freedom of election. At the Soviet elections only one candidate is presented.
  In fact the Russian Communist leaders did not represent the voters or the
  people except in the sense claimed to do so. To speak former Soviet Union as a
  Workers' state is not correct; it was in fact a Party leaders' state.</p>
  <p>For the socialists, 'socialism' means control by society of state, which in
  turn controls the means of production. But control of the state by society can
  be real only if it is maintained by the freely - elected representatives of
  society. It is just a commonsense - however, communists use to dismiss the
  idea, even though claiming their dogma as &quot;scientific&quot;.</p>
  <p>Ms. Shetara Hashem should read the history of communism before calling the
  dogma 'scientific'. In fact, in many cases the communists, I can point out-
  were opposed to science or scientific skepticism. For Example, in former
  soviet Union, the Soviet Ministry of higher education made her doctrine of the
  spontaneous generation of cells from raw albumen and so forth official through
  out the country, even though Pasteur proved it wrong long time ago. In sixties
  we had a same sort of things - for example, 'Kachugin metod' of curing cancer,
  long supported by the president Leningrad leadership. But the worst and most
  damaging of course, Lysenkoite biology. From 1948 to 1964, the former Soviet
  Union suppressed all genetic research and caused damage to agriculture as well
  as to science. You know why? Because communists thought genetic theory was not
  in agreement with Marxist dogma.</p>
  <p>In my view, attraction of Marxist views among his followers is not because
  it is scientific but for the belief that western capitalist society is either
  inherently evil, or at least incapable of satisfying human needs.</p>
  <p>I will again request Ms. Hashem to refute me without being personal. I am
  always eager to welcome you for a friendly debate and discussion. But no
  personal attack and name-calling, please.</p>
