<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. ~ Aesops Fables</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my idea of “blue” may differ from another person’s concept of “blue.” This 
does not mean that John’s shirt changes at all, just my perspective of it is 
different. In a nutshell, relative truths change with time and perspective. They 
are useful in experiencing the world around us, but are different for each 
individual.</p>
<p>Beauty and truth are impossible to define, and must be understood largely on 
the basis of personal experience. As a result, beauty as a criterion for 
scientific truth has largely been rejected in the scientific community. However, 
when the elements that constitute a beautiful theory are examined, they are not 
so different from the logico-empirical criterion for the evaluation of a theory.</p>
