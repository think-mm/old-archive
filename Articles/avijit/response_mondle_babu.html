<p>Hasan bhai,</p>
<p>For the quotation of Bible I was dependent on the following Book :</p>
<p><b>Pobitro Bible (Puraton O notun Niyom) : Bangladesh Bible Society, Dhaka, 
2000</b></p>
<p><b>ISBN 9841703335</b></p>
<p><b>The Bangladesh Bible society<br>
390, New Eskaton Road<br>
Dhaka 1217<br>
Bangladesh.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used some Biblical verse in my &quot;<b>Odharmiker Dhormokothon</b>&quot; which can 
be find here:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/odharmiker_dhormokotha221005.pdf">
https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/odharmiker_dhormokotha221005.pdf</a></p>
<p>So if this is the article that concerns Mondle babu most, let me clarify the 
verses that the article dealt with. </p>
<p>So let's start with the first verse that&nbsp; I quoted&nbsp; in my article:</p>
<p><u><b>&nbsp;First Verse</b></u></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #66FFCC"><font size="4">1. 
&quot;ekhon tomra ei shob cheleder ebong jara Kumari noy emon shob streeder mere felo; 
kintu jara kumari tader tomra nijer jonno bachiye rakho&quot;&nbsp; (Gonona Pustok 
31: 17-18)&nbsp; --- <font color="#FF0000">Page-209, Pobitro Bible, puraton 
niyom</font></font></span></p>
<p>The verse and historical perspective can be found in the following link :</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible3.htm#moses-mass-murder">
http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible3.htm#moses-mass-murder</a> </p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Moses' Mass Murder</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000099">&quot;Behold, these caused the 
children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against 
the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of 
the LORD. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF0000">Now therefore 
kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man 
by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by 
lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000099">&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica"> 
(<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Num/Num031.html#16">Numbers 
31:16-18</a>)</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Comment</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Moses commands the murder of approximately 
100,000 young males and, roughly, 68,000 helpless women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Consider women and children of your own family: 
No matter how sick they may lay, or how they may go against a religion, how 
would you feel if a man named Moses, claiming to speak for God, sent men into 
your house and hacked to pieces the women and male children? Also, how would you 
react if they spotted a female child, dragged her off with them to do as they 
please with her? Note that these innocent virgins served for their own sexual 
pleasures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Midian, the land of the Midianites, did not 
reside in an area regarded as a natural enemy of Israel for centuries, and in 
fact lay hundreds of miles away from the Israelite encampment. Moses, himself, 
had lived in Midian as fugitive after committing his first murder. In short, 
Midian presented no threat to God's &quot;Chosen People.&quot;</font></p>
<p>You can find the specific verse in the following site too:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/">http://www.blueletterbible.org/</a>
</p>
<p>==================================</p>
<p><u>2nd Verse</u></p>
<p>many Christians would dismiss these as anachronisms that were eliminated with 
the coming of Jesus. However, in the New Testament Jesus frequently reaffirms 
the laws of the prophets, which I quoted in Bangla :&nbsp; </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #66FFCC"><font size="4">
ekotha Mone koro na, aami Moshir (Musar) aain-kanun aar nobider lekha baatil 
korte eshechi. aami shegulo baatil korte ashini, borong purno korte eshechi (Mothi 
: 5:17) ---&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Page-6, Pobitro Bible, Notun niyom</font>
</font></span></p>
<p>Again, You can find the specific verse in the following site:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/">http://www.blueletterbible.org/</a>
</p>
<p><b>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not 
come to destroy, but to fulfill. </b></p>
<p>Please take a look that my Bangla book specifically mentioned about Musa (Moshi), 
but the above cited English verse does not have the name mentioned. However, I 
found other translations where they mentioned Musa's name specifically. Here it 
goes :</p>
<p><font color="#880000">&quot;Don't misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to 
abolish the law of<b> Moses</b> or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to 
fulfill them.</font><br>

<p>So Bangla verse was not misquoted at all. I am not sure which version 
(translation) is Modlebabu reading, I can send the scanned copy of the page of 
Bangla Bible if anybody wants. </p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p><u>3rd verse:</u></p>
<p>Now come to the most controversial (?) verse that caused irritation to Mondle 
babu. Christians like to pride themselves on their &quot;family values&quot; and portray 
Jesus as the &quot;Prince of Peace&quot; in the world.&nbsp; But they fail to remember 
that Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send 
	peace, but a sword.(<nobr><b><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/popup.pl?book=Mat&chapter=10&verse=34&version=kjv">Mat 
	10:34</a></b></nobr>) For I am come to set a man at variance against his 
	father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against 
	her mother in law. ( <nobr><b>
	<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/popup.pl?book=Mat&chapter=10&verse=35&version=kjv">
	Mat 10:35</a>)</b></nobr></p>
</blockquote>

<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Comment</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">These words of Jesus confirm the unbelievable 
notion that Jesus did not come to establish peace, but rather to send the sword 
and to put man against his family. So much for family values.</font></p>

<p>==============================</p>
<p><u>4th verse:</u></p>
<p>Now come to the last verse that I quoted from thousands of similar verses of 
Bible. Here Jesus directly said that he would&nbsp; Kill Children</p>
<p><font size="4"><span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #66FFCC">&quot;Shei

<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Jesus Will Kill Children</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000099">&quot;Behold, I will cast her into a 
bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they 
repent of their deeds. And I will kill her children with death; and all the 
churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I

(<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Rev/Rev002.html#22">Revelation 
2:22-23</a>)</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Comment</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">If anyone thinks Jesus represents only a 
peaceful loving soul, then think again. For an act of adultery, Jesus would kill 
innocent children for the adultery of others; hardly fair justice, love, or the 
concern for human beings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Some apologists claim that &quot;children&quot; refers to 
the followers of a cult of Jezebel and not to children birthed from Jezebel. 
However, if this proved the case, the situation would appear even more horrific, 
for a cult of believers could number in the dozens, hundreds, thousands, or 
more. The deaths of these multitude of cult believers (which would include 
children within its membership) would only make the moralistic problem far more 
atrocious.</font></p>

<p>Hassan bhai, there are hundred and thousands of violent verses in Bible which 
can be cited:&nbsp; <font face="Arial, Helvetica">

Mark 3:29, Matthew 12:31&nbsp; and many other places.&nbsp; But lets not go that 
far. Lets concentrate what I wrote and let me know where I misquoted Bible. I 
again challenge that I am ready to send the&nbsp; of scanned copy of the 
specific pages of&nbsp; my Bangla book anytime.</p>
<p>You can send this to Mandle babu or anyone, if you want.</p>
