<p>I disagree. Basically critical thinking which we are trying to promote thru 
Mukto-Mona,&nbsp; involves a critical look at widely held views and beliefs on 
personalities [be it Tagore, Sheikh Mujib, Mother Teresa, Farhad Mazhar, Russel, 
Humayun Azad, Tolstoy, Stalin or anyone] and offer factual data that debunks 
popular myths in parallel to oppose religious dogma etc. This is an integral 
part of critical thinking, to those who apotheosize such personalities it may 
seem as nit picking, cynical thing to do. But it really does not have to be. </p>
<p>Some super-humanlike image has always surrounded most of&nbsp; subcontinent's 
revered philosophical and religious figures. It has been almost a taboo not to 
question or criticize the great icons of our philosophy, culture and religion. 
Utsho manush a rationalist paper from India once published an article 
-&quot;Vivekananda- Onnyo Chokhe&quot; to demystify the myths surrounding Vivekananda. 
Prabir Ghosh, the premier rationalist of India and founder of Indian Science and 
Rationalist Association, is one of the few to break the taboo and has taken an 
irreverent but realistic look at these venerable figures, exposing their 
fallibility and limitations, and in the process debunking the aura of sublimity 
that the popular view hold in regard to their mystical sayings, reducing them to 
human level. Ghosh cited many contrary facts of Swami Vivekananda, Ram Mohan, 
Rishi Aravinda, Ramkrishna, Gandhiji, Radha Krishnan et al. He recently 
demystified Mother Terasa's miracle incident too and protested late popes 
beatification of Teresa.&nbsp; Demystifying is part and parcel of critical 
thinking. Their effort should not be taken as &quot;bashing&quot;, &quot;mud slinging&quot;, or 
&quot;character assassination&quot; or readily overturned by attributing &quot;Radical 
feminism&quot; etc. Any one can dispute anybody's claim by portraying him/her 
radical, for e.g, an Bengali atheist like JP can be disputed by calling him a&nbsp; 
&quot;radical atheist&quot; in some argument. Just because a women can't show his breast 
[the reason is cultural, not physical]&nbsp; does not mean she is inferior or 
she has to be deprived from equal rights.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Tagore is a great figure, all critics in MM seem to agree on this and 
mentioned his huge contribution. But that does not mean he (or anyone) is above 
criticism. Members of MM, may be for first time showed courage to debate the 
issue openly breaking the taboo. Let's appreciate this. </p>
<p>Lastly, aparthib has summed up very nicely in his recent article, members in 
this forum might have read it :</p>
