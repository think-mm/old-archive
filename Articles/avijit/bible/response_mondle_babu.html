<h1 align="center">Response to the allegation of misquoting from Bible : I 
defend my position once again.</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hasan bhai,</p>
<p>Thanks for your email. I think I responded to these (common) allegations 
previously. I am not sure whether you sent my response to the person concerned; 
in case you didn't, I am writing it once again with more clarification.&nbsp; 
Let me state one one thing very clearly. I did not invent those &quot;holy&quot; verses 
myself, neither misinterpreted/misquoted those. I directly (literally) quoted 
from holy books. If someone gets ashamed or offended of quoting these verses, 
he/she might ask himself why his merciful God has quoted so much unholy 
treasures in his most sacred books that even His devout followers get offended 
time to time for quoting those.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, for the quotation of Bible I was dependent on the following Book :</p>
<p><b>Pobitro Bible (Puraton O notun Niyom) : Bangladesh Bible Society, Dhaka, 
2000</b></p>
<p><b>ISBN 9841703335</b></p>
<p><b>The Bangladesh Bible society<br>
390, New Eskaton Road<br>
Dhaka 1217<br>
Bangladesh.</b></p>
<p><b>Here is the link of scanned cover page of the book :</b></p>
<p><b><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/bible/bible1.gif">
https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/bible/bible1.gif</a> </b></p>
<p>I used some Biblical verses (though Bible was not my sole topic of interest 
of the article)&nbsp; in my &quot;<b>Odharmiker Dhormokothon</b>&quot; which can 
be found here:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/odharmiker_dhormokotha221005.pdf">
https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/odharmiker_dhormokotha221005.pdf</a></p>
<p>If this is the article that concerns Mondle babu most, let me clarify the 
verses that the article dealt with. </p>
<p>Let's start with the first verse that&nbsp; I quoted&nbsp; in my article:</p>
<p><u><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">&nbsp;First Verse</span></b></u></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 700; "><font size="4">1. 
&quot;ekhon tomra ei shob cheleder ebong jara Kumari noy emon shob streeder mere felo; 
kintu jara kumari tader tomra nijer jonno bachiye rakho&quot;&nbsp; (Gonona Pustok 
31: 17-18)&nbsp; --- <font color="#FF0000">Page-209, Pobitro Bible, puraton 
niyom</font></font></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse and historical perspective can be found in the following link :</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible3.htm#moses-mass-murder">
http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible3.htm#moses-mass-murder</a> </p>
<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Moses' Mass Murder</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000099">&quot;Behold, these caused the 
children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against 
the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of 
the LORD. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF0000">Now therefore 
kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man 
by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by 
lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#000099">&quot;</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica"> 
(<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Num/Num031.html#16">Numbers 
31:16-18</a>)</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Comment</font></h3>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Moses commands the murder of approximately 
100,000 young males and, roughly, 68,000 helpless women.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Consider women and children of your own family: 
No matter how sick they may lay, or how they may go against a religion, how 
would you feel if a man named Moses, claiming to speak for God, sent men into 
your house and hacked to pieces the women and male children? Also, how would you 
react if they spotted a female child, dragged her off with them to do as they 
please with her? Note that these innocent virgins served for their own sexual 
pleasures.</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Midian, the land of the Midianites, did not 
reside in an area regarded as a natural enemy of Israel for centuries, and in 
fact lay hundreds of miles away from the Israelite encampment. Moses, himself, 
had lived in Midian as fugitive after committing his first murder. In short, 
Midian presented no threat to God's &quot;Chosen People.&quot;</font></p>

<p>You can find the specific verse in the following site too:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/">http://www.blueletterbible.org/</a>
</p>
<p>==================================</p>
<p><u><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">2nd Verse</span></b></u></p>
<p>Many Christians would dismiss these as anachronisms that were eliminated with 
the coming of Jesus. However, in the New Testament Jesus frequently reaffirms 
the laws of the prophets, which I quoted in Bangla :&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><span style="font-weight: 700; "><font size="4">ekotha Mone koro na, aami Moshir (Musar) aain-kanun aar nobider lekha baatil 
korte eshechi. aami shegulo baatil korte ashini, borong purno korte eshechi (Mothi 
: 5:17) ---&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Page-6, Pobitro Bible, Notun niyom</font>
	</font></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, You can find the specific verse in the following site:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/">http://www.blueletterbible.org/</a>
</p>
<p><b>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not 
come to destroy, but to fulfill. </b></p>
<p>Please take a look that my Bangla book specifically mentioned the name of Musa (Moshi), 
but the above cited English verse does not have the name mentioned. However, I 
found other translations where they mentioned Musa's name very specifically. Here it 
goes :</p>
<p><font color="#880000">&quot;Don't misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to 
abolish the law of<b> Moses</b> or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to 
fulfill them.</font><br>
<a class="versionNote" target="_blank" href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/nlt_full_copyright.html">
New Living Translation © 1996 Tyndale Charitable Trust</a></p>
<p>So Bangla verse was not misquoted at all. I am not sure which version 
(translation) is Modlebabu reading, I can send the scanned copy of the page of 
Bangla Bible if anybody wants. </p>
<p>==============================</p>
<p><u><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">3rd verse:</span></b></u></p>
<p>Now come to the most controversial (?) verse that caused irritation to Mondle 
babu. Christians like to pride themselves on their &quot;family values&quot; and portray 
Jesus as the &quot;Prince of Peace&quot; in the world.&nbsp; But they fail to remember 
that Jesus said:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send 
	peace, but a sword.(<nobr><b><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/popup.pl?book=Mat&chapter=10&verse=34&version=kjv">Mat 
	10:34</a></b></nobr>) For I am come to set a man at variance against his 
	father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against 
	her mother in law. ( <nobr><b>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">If anyone thinks Jesus represents only a 
peaceful loving soul, then think again. For an act of adultery, Jesus would kill 
innocent children for the adultery of others; hardly fair justice, love, or the 
concern for human beings. Mondle Babu said , &quot;Mondo Kaaj hote mon firaibar jonno 
shokol dhormei ei rokom prescription dewa hoy&quot;. If killing of innocent child for 
the adultery of others, and if this is what serves &quot;justice&quot; in Mondle babu's 
word, I have nothing much to say about. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Some apologists claim that &quot;children&quot; refers to 
the followers of a cult of Jezebel and not to children birthed from Jezebel. 
However, if this proved the case, the situation would appear even more horrific, 
for a cult of believers could number in the dozens, hundreds, thousands, or 
more. The deaths of these multitude of cult believers (which would include 
children within its membership) would only make the moralistic problem far more 
atrocious.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hassan bhai, there are hundred and thousands of violent verses in Bible which 
can be cited ver easily:&nbsp; <font face="Arial, Helvetica">
<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Exd/Exd022.html#18">Exodus 22:18-20</a>,
<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Deu/Deu022.html#22">Deuteronomy 
22:22</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Jdg/Jdg019.html#24">
Judges 19:24-25</a>,
<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1Ti/1Ti002.html#11">I Timothy 
2:11-14</a>, <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Lev/Lev012.html#top">
Leviticus 12:2</a>,
<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/Deu/Deu025.html#11">Deuteronomy 
25:11-12</a>, </font>Matthew 10:34, Luke 22:36, Matthew. 24:6-7, Exodus 12:29, 
Mark 3:29, Matthew 12:31&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; <span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">It always 
amazes me how many times this Biblical God orders the killing of innocent people 
even after the Ten Commandments said <i>Thou shall not kill</i>.&nbsp; For example, 
God kills 70,000 innocent people because David ordered a census of the people (<a href="http://www.evilbible.com/July.htm#July 9">1 
Chronicles 21</a>).&nbsp; God also orders the destruction of 60 cities so that the 
Israelites can live there.&nbsp; He orders the killing of all the men, women, and 
children of each city, and the looting of all of value (<a href="http://www.evilbible.com/July.htm#July 8">Deuteronomy 
3</a>).&nbsp; He orders another attack and the killing of <i>all the living 
creatures of the city: men and women, young, and old, as well as oxen sheep, and 
asses</i> (<a href="http://www.evilbible.com/March.htm#March 31">Joshua 6</a>).&nbsp; 
In <a href="http://www.evilbible.com/January.htm#Jan 24">Judges 21</a>, He 
orders the murder of all the people of Jabesh-gilead, except for the virgin 
girls who were taken to be forcibly raped and married.&nbsp; When they wanted more 
virgins, God told them to hide alongside the road and when they saw a girl they 
liked, kidnap her and forcibly rape her and make her your wife!....</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span> But lets not go that 
far. Lets concentrate what I wrote in my article (&quot;<b>Odharmiker Dhormokothon</b>) and let me know where I misquoted Bible. 
I quoted only 4 verses from hundreds of cruel verses of Bible. These are meant 
to identify possible problems in the Bible (and other religious books too), 
especially problems which are inherent in a literalist or fundamentalist 
interpretation. Indeed, Some selections may be resolvable on certain 
interpretations (as per Mondle Babu's claim) --after all, almost any problem can 
be eliminated with suitable rationalizations (don't forget hardcore Islamists 
also try to rationalize their cruel Jehadi verses)--but it is the reader's 
obligation to test this possibility and to decide whether it really makes 
appropriate sense to do this. I again challenge that please prove that I 
misquoted anything.. I am ready to send any documents you want. </p>
<p>If you don't believe my word (and you don't have to for sure), you can check 
the following links for details. These links are no hocus pocus. Most of them 
are ex-Christian freethinkers with high profile academic backgrounds. Many of 
them are even University Professors teaching&nbsp; for many years. Many of them 
argue that many Christians havent really read the Bible, or perhaps just read 
certain passages (good or neutral verses) in church. This is understandable, as 
the Bible is hard to read due to its archaic language and obscure references. 
Also many priests and preachers dont like to read certain passages in the Bible 
because they present a message of hate not love. Anyway here are the links 
(kindly read, do not just throw):</p>

<p>&nbsp;Lastly Hasan bhai, just like you I am also not at all concerned with 
who will type-set the book. I did not even want to publish anything in the first 
place. I am no &quot;Shahityik&quot;, neither I want to be. I have lot more things to do 
in my life. I agreed to publish this as you guys requested me for this. I am 
sure Mondle babu would not have found any problem if I concentrated on Quran, 
Hadith, Gita and restricted myself&nbsp; from quoting his &quot;Holy Bible&quot; in my 
writing.&nbsp; Indeed, some may find greatness quoting cruel verses from other 
people's religious books (for example Quran) but keeping complete silence in 
pointing atrocities lying within his own faith. I am not sure about others, but 
I don't see any &quot;greatness&quot; here.&nbsp; It's merely hypocrisy, if not the act is&nbsp; 
termed as &quot;communal&quot;.&nbsp; I think we Mukto-Monas are beyond that level.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>I don't think any other further communication is necessary unless somebody 
wants any document from me.&nbsp; Please do not hesitate if you have any 
confusion in this regard. I sincerely appreciate the effort you and Saadi bhai 
made for the book. I also thank Mondle Babu for agreeing to typeset initially. 
It was unfortunate that we could not come to the point of agreement. But I hope 
we would keep our mutual respect for each other in future. If there is any due 
left from any side, I would request Hasan Bhai to take a look and inform me 
later. </p>
<p>Wishing everyone a happy life.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
