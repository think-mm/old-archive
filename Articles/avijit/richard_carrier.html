  <p>&nbsp;
  <p>In our 2004 Michigan debate, where Dan Barker and I debated Michael Corey
  and Hassanain Rajabali, our opponents claimed the Koran miraculously predicted
  certain claims now established by modern science (an audio recording of the
  debate can be heard at <a href="http://shiasource.com/Events.asp?TitleText=Events">ShiaSource</a>).
  I made the observation that nonprophetic humans had made similarly prescient
  'predictions,' such as Thales first having the idea that all life came from
  water, and that the Koran can't claim to be prophetic if its ideas come from a
  previous nondivine source (or if someone else could clearly come up with the
  same idea without divine help). Dan added that if you make enough claims, some
  will be true even by accident, while any opportunity for a real miracle of
  scientific prophecy in the Koran was evidently squandered. For example, who
  needs to know about the Hubble expansion? Wouldn't hearing about the germ
  theory of disease be far more useful?</p>
  <p>This is not new, of course. I have written on this kind of argument before.
  On the failure of the Koran to get science right, see my essay &quot;<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/islam.html">Cosmology
  and the Koran: A Response to Muslim Fundamentalists</a>&quot; (2001) and the
  resources linked there. But several others have written on this who have
  first-hand expertise in the subject of Islam: Taner Edis, &quot;<a href="http://www2.truman.edu/~edis/writings/articles/quran-science.html">'Quran-science':
  Scientific miracles from the 7th century?</a>&quot;; Avijit Roy, &quot;<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/super_scientific_scriptures.html">Super-Scientific
  Religious Scriptures!</a>&quot;; Denis Giron, &quot;<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/denis_giron/islamsci.html">Islamic
  Science: Does Islamic literature contain scientific miracles?</a>&quot;; Paul
  Martin, &quot;<a href="http://www.bibleandscience.com/science/quran.htm">The
  Qur'an and Science: Do They Agree?</a>&quot;; Syed Kamran Mirza, &quot;<a href="http://www.secularislam.org/guide/embryology.htm">Ambiguity
  of Human Embryology: Science in Quran</a>&quot;; and the resources at <a href="http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Science/">Answering-Islam.org</a>.</p>
  <p>The central point at issue in the debate was Michael Corey's claim that the
  Koran predicted the expanding universe. I was unfamiliar with the relevant
  verse so could not respond directly. But now that I have investigated the
  claim, I can honestly say it is inaccurate in two respects: it is actually the
  Hebrew Bible, not the Koran, that 'predicted' this--the Koran is effectively
  paraphrasing Isaiah 51:13 and 42:5; and I think the verses in question, in
  Isaiah and the Koran, are too ambiguous to be taken as any sort of prediction.
  Denis Giron has addressed this claim in expert detail in &quot;<a href="http://geocities.com/denis_giron/zaariyaat-isaiah.html">Expansion
  of the Universe in the Bible and the Qur'an: Comparing Isaiah to <i>Soorat
  az-Zaariyaat</i></a>,&quot; and so has Dr. Abdul-Kalaam Pangloss in &quot;<a href="http://www.geocities.com/freethoughtmecca/bigbang.html">The
  Qur'an and the Big Bang</a>.&quot; In short, the relevant word also means
  'enrich' and in fact the only other time it is used in the Koran it means
  'wealthy,' hence most translations of the Koran in print translate the verse
  in just that way:</p>
  <blockquote>
    From <a href="http://www.universalunity.net/quran4/051.qmt.html">Translations
    of the Qur'an</a>:<br>
    <br>
    <b>Yusufali:</b> &quot;create the vastness of space&quot;<br>
    <b>Pickthal:</b> &quot;make the vast extent&quot; of heaven<br>
    <b>Shakir:</b> &quot;makers of things ample&quot;<br>
    <b>Khalifa:</b> &quot;we will continue to expand it&quot;
  </blockquote>
  <p>Only Khalifa renders it as &quot;we will continue to expand it,&quot; even
  though there is no future tense in the verse, nor the word 'continue.'</p>
  <p>In both Isaiah and the Koran it is most likely the reference is to Genesis,
  when God 'separated' the heavens by placing the firmament between the waters
  of heaven and the waters of earth (and then expanded the heavens into seven,
  per Koran 41.12, and Jewish legend, e.g. 2 Corinthians 12). Certainly, no one
  ever understood it in any other way until after the Hubble expansion was
  discovered. And since, in my observation, the Koran otherwise gets cosmology
  entirely wrong, we have no reason to believe it was saying anything miraculous
  here. In the same fashion, the following verse (51.48) says, in parallel
  structure, that the same God who 'expands' the heavens also 'spreads out' the
  earth. So to interpret 51.47 as meaning God is even now expanding the universe
  entails interpreting that he is even now spreading out the earth, too, which
  of course is not happening (the earth, even the continents and continental
  plates, remain, on average, the same size).</p>
  <p>By the same trick, I can make almost any lengthy ancient text predict
  something amazing. Michael Corey said he would be &quot;amazed&quot; if
  someone thousands of years ago had predicted scientific facts that would not
  be proven until today--implying this would be evidence to him of divine
  inspiration. Well, let's test that principle. Are there any nondivine texts in
  antiquity that make amazingly prescient predictions of scientific facts, facts
  that would not be proved until the modern age? Certainly. The best example is
  a famous Latin poem summarizing Epicurean philosophy, which far outdoes the
  Koran in both clarity and quantity of marvelous scientific predictions.</p>
  <p>Epicurus predicted (as reported by Lucretius in his poetic summary <i>De
  Rerum Natura</i>) the existence of the atom and the molecule (the binding of
  two atoms to produce a different chemical); the law of inertia (unless
  retarded by a blow, objects are in constant motion--not proved until Galileo);
  the principal of universal natural law (the same principles of behavior that
  apply on earth apply the same everywhere in the universe--a theory denied by
  Aristotle, and by the Christian Church until Galileo challenged the Church's
  view and Newton proved him right); the rain cycle (that rain comes from water
  that has evaporated from seas and lakes, due to the heat of the sun and the
  motion of the air, and is stored in clouds, then falls when those clouds are
  heated or saturated); that sound is a pressure wave of air molecules whose
  shape determines the sound; that light is comprised of particles; that the
  sense of smell is caused by the shape of molecules fitting the shape of
  receptors in the nose; that lightning is caused by friction between storm
  fronts and consists of rapidly-moving particles (which we now call electrons)
  that are smaller than the atoms that comprise visible matter; that earthquakes
  are caused by slipping fault lines; that the Nile rises every year because of
  snow melting at its source; that animals, including humans, evolved by natural
  selection; that matter is mostly empty space; that magnetism is the result of
  a constant discharge and absorption of particles between magnetic objects;
  that fire is not an element; that there is no center of the universe but many
  different solar systems with their own planets; and that the speed of light is
  finite. He also predicted relativity, arguing that motion is relative, and
  time does not exist except as the relation of objects and events to each
  other, and hence time is also relative to the observer.</p>

  <p>I don't think the Koran comes anywhere near such a long list of dead-on
  predictions. And Epicurus declared them in far less ambiguous terms than
  anything purportedly prescient in the Koran. So the conclusion must be that
  mere human reason is better than divine inspiration at predicting the truth
  about the world. Epicurus beats Mohammed. Man beats God. Epicurus wasn't
  divinely inspired. He was just a clever man. After all, like the Koran, he got
  a lot wrong, too. But he got a heck of a lot more right--in part by using the
  same trick: if you make enough guesses, some will turn out right just by
  chance, and if you ignore all the misses, you can make Epicurus look
  miraculously prescient. Likewise, just as proponents of the Koran do, we are
  liberally &quot;interpreting&quot; things he said in a manner more in
  agreement with modern facts than Epicurus may have intended. But in the main,
  we need no tricks: Epicurus really did get many things right, by making some
  intelligent guesses, and reasoning things out from there. Very much unlike the
  Koran.</p>
  <p>Let's take one other example for our concluding point. Epicurus predicted
  quantum indeterminism: he said atoms will sometimes randomly swerve, which is
  the same thing as saying that they sometimes randomly change their momentum or
  location, which has been confirmed. Was Epicurus therefore inspired by God?
  No. He just got lucky. He knew nothing of Wave Mechanics, the Compton Radius,
  or Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. He was simply trying to solve what he
  perceived to be the problem of free will, drawing on the empirical observation
  that particles suspended in a medium appear to move at random (which would
  also later become a proven scientific theory called Brownian Motion). So, too,
  Isaiah was simply trying to state what was obvious to him: that God is the one
  who made both the earth and the heavens so vast, and separated them from each
  other, and he alone keeps them that way.</p>
  <p>This is quite probable, since neither Isaiah nor Mohammed knew anything
  about the difference between stars and galaxies, for example, and yet only the
  latter are expanding away from each other. The stars within our galaxy, which
  comprise by far most of what Mohammed and Isaiah would have imagined as the
  visible 'heavens' (and hence what they would have understood by that word),
  are not expanding, but are held in place by gravity. Just imagine the lost
  opportunity here: Allah could have given Mohammed the most incredible proof of
  scientific prescience by having him describe the difference between star
  systems and galaxies, or even stating Hubble's Law of expansion, perhaps with
  exact figures or at least the added point that this rate of expansion is
  accelerating. But no, all he gave him was the incredibly vague 'we are the
  ones who make it vast.' There is nothing scientific about that.</p>
