<p>Quite funny. You disputed a reputed social scientist's ( who is a 
professor emeritus from the Department of Sociology of the University of 
Southern California and former director of the Marriage and Family Therapy 
Doctoral Training Program) work by calling it &quot;pop&quot; however, quite amusingly he 
is quoting from some websites like www.hispeace.org, www.divorceresourcecenter, 
contemporaryfamilies.org&nbsp; and one &quot;email&quot; from university etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Of course Prf. Ahron's work has been peer reviewed. For example, please 
check&nbsp; the following paper of&nbsp; Ahron (published in Journal) :</p>
<p>What grown children have to say about their parents’ divorce.. Children’s 
Legal Rights Journal 24, 48-56.</p>
<p>Adult children’s relationships with their fathers twenty years after divorce. 
Family Relations, 52, 340-351.</p>
<p>It’s never too late to have a good divorce, Divorce Magazine, Toronto, 
Chicago, New York, California editions. etc. </p>
<p>Also note that she received Outstanding Achievement Award, Wisconsin Library 
Association Literary Award (WLA),1995 for her related book, The Good Divorce.</p>
<p>Our conflict started while Biplab asked for counter evidences against his oversimplified conclusion - &quot;Shontan 
Dharoner por Divorce kono motei kamyo noy&quot; and I provided, but at the same 
timeI clearly 
said, &quot;I am not arguing that Dr. Constance Ahrons (and other) research is right 
and yours is wrong (or vise versa). What I am saying that the issue is still 
very much complex and conflicting in many ways. Each and every family has their 
own problem and they have right to solve it in their own ways (what they find 
right for them, staying together or being apart). Let's not impose any 
&quot;oversimplified sermon&quot; (in that case you are jumping into a political movement, 
I am not) in the name scientism or whatever.&quot;. Dr. Pal does not seem to listen.
</p>
<p>Now lets formulate an interesting hypothetical scenario (there are lot of 
such cases in real life). Let's think of a couple who have a kid. The husband 
regularly torture his wife for dowry. He also maintains a relationship with 
another lady besides his marriage life. He regularly&nbsp; comes late at night 
and starts beating his wife which wakes his kid up from the slip. The kid has to 
watch&nbsp; their quarrel each and every day and gets mentally sick. Now 
question to Biplab Pal. How a&nbsp; Bigganbadi rule will solve the issue? Do you 
suggest that the wife should all along stay with her husband just for your 
universal rule - &quot;Divorce is not desirable once we have kid&quot;?&nbsp; Pls let me 
know.</p>

&gt; Postmodern views often sound wonderful unless analyzed in depth. Then 
oversimplification and irrationality of glib talk will be quite obvious.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately this is exactly happend to your case. :) That's whay you are 
taking our discussion to a different direction by bringing irrelavant issues. 
Following are the examples: <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; A. Divorce is being settled by Talaq in Muslim community in their own ways..<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; B. In India parents are forcing their daughters to stay in a marriage where 
they are being tortured--mind you this is not 'bad' marriage, this is criminally 
offensive situation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Response : We are now debating on totally differnt topics such as talak or 
indian hindu law of marriage. Anywyas, Quite amusingly both the examples (stated 
above) &quot;agrees&quot; with Biblab's revolutionary &quot;scientific&quot; conclusion : &quot;Divorce 
is not dallowed once a couple gets kid&quot;. See, &quot;For the sake of children&quot;, &quot;for 
the sake of society&quot;, &quot;familly presure&quot;, &quot;religious laws&quot;, &quot;social 
discrimination&quot;, &quot;family honor&quot; etc. has not given any room to the oppresed 
women in our subcontinent to take individual decision for divorce right 
(traditional hindu law in particular). Now, Biplab is suggesting another 
&quot;Bigganbadi&quot; strict rule like a sharia - &quot;You do not have any right to divorce 
your omnipotent husband, BECAUSE you have kids, no matter how oppressive 
situation you are in.&quot;. You are NOT allowed, as long as &quot;SCIENTISM&quot; says this! 
Amen!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;My view was, this law should be based on social research-that is <br>
&gt;what I call Bigganbad. Put your rationality in perspective and let <br>
&gt;me know whether you have any objection to my statement.<br>
<br>
Response : Good too see that you are not in power to implement such &quot;scientific 
sharia law&quot; -- &quot;Divorce is not allowed for those who have kids&quot; :). Seriously, 
it's a good blessing for many. <br>
<br>
BTW, social resarchers also conclude that religious people lead a happier life 
compared to non-believers. Hope this will be a good incentive for you to take 
away the &quot;atheist right&quot; from the people-- of course &quot;scientifically&quot;. Also this 
will be a good &quot;scientific&quot; motivation for you to implement religious laws in 
states, because, law should be based on your social research, right!<br>
<br>
Perhaps, Indian Prime minister Vajpayee will also not feel very happy if someone 
wants to take away his &quot;bachelor right&quot; as some social study shows married 
people are more happier. <br>
<br>
What do ya think?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In order to stand by feminism, Avijit seems to have lost ALL OF his thinking 
process completely and liquidated his own rationality!<br>
<br>
<br>
Response: Ha ha. Be happy with your &quot;Biggan badi&quot; conclusion. I think you are 
too desperate now. I will let you say your last word in this case :).<br>
<br>
It's really tragic episode that I have to respond such meaning less comments - 
&quot;his thinking process completely and liquidated his own rationality&quot;. What else 
I can do other than accept - after all Must have been another Bigganbadi 
deduction! <br>
<br>
Time to wrap up guys and come to conclusion as the thread is going newer and 
newer dimension, completely seperate from where the debate started. If one 
thinks like a tabloid reader &quot;who will say the last word he will will&quot; to judge 
the outcome of a debate, then be with it! Biplab has won ! Dont get surprise if 
you dont get any comment in this thread hereafter. :) <br>
