  <p><span style="color: #003300">It has been quite some time we all are being
  bombarded&nbsp; in myriad e-forums, web-sites, videos and books to show as to
  how Islam is a very scientific religion and uncompromising Islamic scholars
  are eager to prove that many modern day scientific discoveries were accurately
  predicted in the Qur'an. In the recent few years, in fact soon after <a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/article/western_scientists_.htm" target="_blank">Dr.
  Maurice Bucaille and Keith Moore's (in)famous book&nbsp;</a> came into
  lime-light, a number of &quot;Islamic scientists&quot; have claimed that there
  is credible scientific evidence for the existence of modern science in Islam
  as revealed in their miraculous holy book, Qur'an. My two-part article has
  been written to expose the fallacy of that claim. In the first part of my
  article,&nbsp; I provided a critique of&nbsp; five contemporary claims that Qur'an
  miraculously supports the recent development of science. In this part, I will
  go much further with five more claims and argue that science makes a strong
  case against &quot;Islamic Science&quot; and &quot;miraculous nature&quot; of
  holy Qur'an.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="color: #003300">I'd like to start this part with&nbsp; an excerpt from
  a book written by famous Bangladeshi religious scientist Professor Shamsher Ali, the Chairman of the Committee on 
  Science in Al-Qur'an, Islamic Foundation Bangladesh, who use to teach in
  Physics department of Dhaka University as well -</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">Anybody having the faith in this absolute truth is welcome to use the 
    Qur'an as a test for our scientific principle and not vice versa. 
    Incidentally it may be mentioned that Maurice Bucaillie in his book, 'The 
    Qur'an, the Bible and Science' already asserted : &quot;There is not a single 
    verse in Holy Qur'an which is assailable from scientific point of view&quot;. Our 
    present work fully support this assertion&quot;&nbsp; [<a href="#1">1</a>]&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="color: #003300">This is a real irony, an extraordinary claim
  from a scientist I must say! The author, even being one of the renowned
  celebrity in&nbsp; scientific community in Bangladesh, puts Qur'an as an authentic tool to 
  test science, and NOT vice versa! A true scientist will never follow this
  approach as he should know, science is not faith; it accepts a theory as a
  tentative truth, only if it explains observations of reality better then any
  other one based on logic and evidence. For example if a new scientific
  hypothesis or theory is put forward, it is rigorously scrutinized, experiments
  done, observations made and if all the results correspond to the theory, it is
  accepted, till it is denied by later observations and experiments. All the
  method lie well-within the strict domain of science, no sane person can claim
  to test science against a religious holy book.&nbsp; A religious book, on the
  other hand,&nbsp; preaches absoluteness and infallibility of its claim to the
  truth, thus it is nothing but a dogma. Dogma does not admit of any possibility
  of its being wrong, therefore ruling out any revision. How can it be a tool to
  test science? I wonder what will our students learn if such malicious
  definition of science, formulated by Dr. Shamsher Ali is being in our
  universities.&nbsp; This is one of the many examples to show where&nbsp; our education system
  is mounting! Recently another author of&nbsp; Islamic-scientific book
  proclaimed that&nbsp; Qur'an itself is enough to reveal the scientific mysteries
  of nature; rest are all redundant and superfluous [<a href="#2">2</a>].&nbsp;</span>
  <span style="color: #003300">If we really have such a super-scientific book in our hand who 
  needs Brian Greene's <i>The Elegant Universe</i>, Stephen Hawking's&nbsp; <i>A
  Brief History of Time</i> or Steven Weinberg's <i>The First Three Minutes </i>to
  explore mystery to common people? Why did Newton wrote his famous <i>Principia</i>
  then, I cant comprehend. Every single scientific invention is supposed to be
  in Qur'an as claimed, and&nbsp; rest are redundant. Indeed; If the entire room is illuminated 
  by 1000 watts of light, who will look for a candle?</span></p>

    YUSUFALI: It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory 
    and the moon to be a light (of beauty), and measured out stages for her; 
    that ye might know the number of years and the count (of time). Nowise did 
    Allah create this but in truth and righteousness. (Thus) doth He explain His

    detaileth the revelations for people who have knowledge.<br>
    <br>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span style="color: #003300">If a reader reads the above verse carefully,
  he will know that there is no 
  &quot;source of light&quot; or &quot;deflector&quot; in that verse. It is simply said: the
  sun 
  a shining brightness ( &quot;splendor and glory of brightness&quot;) and the moon 
  a light!!<br>
  &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="color: #003300">From the ancient period&nbsp; from their daily observation people
  came to know that the 
  sun had strong and bright light and moon had cool and softer light that illuminates and 
  helps in the darkness of the night. In Bangla we&nbsp; commonly say <img border="0" src="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/roudro_topto.gif" width="66" height="21">and
  <img border="0" src="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/chondralokito_rat.gif" width="86" height="21"> in the same way in&nbsp; English we use &quot;Sunshine&quot; 
  and&nbsp; &quot;Moonlight&quot;. This means, ancient Bengali/Englishmen also
  realized that 
  the sun is more shinning/bright/hot&nbsp;than the appealing moon, in the same 
	way an ancient Arab could observe. In fact, it is so simple that even an 
  infant could notice. Here I quote the two words that Qur'an uses [<a href="#3">3</a>]:</span></p>

  </font>Moon light.<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  </font></font>
  </font>
  <p><span style="color: #003300">Dr. Bucaille, however,&nbsp; in his book 
	proclaimed loudly [<a href="#7">7</a>]:</span></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">The Sun is a shining glory (<i>diya'</i>) and the 
		Moon a light (<i>nur</i>). This translation would appear to be more 
		correct than those given by others, where the two terms are inverted. In 
		fact there is little difference in meaning since <i>diya'</i> belongs to 
		a root (<i>dw'</i>) which, according to Kazimirski's authoritative 
		Arabic/French dictionary, means 'to be bright, to shine' (e.g. like a 
		fire). The same author attributes to the substantive in question the 
		meaning of 'light'.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><span style="color: #003300">The above explanation of Bucaille may be 
	correct, however any rational person can perceive that such explanation need 
	not any extraordinary miraculous claim, if we consider the historical 
	context of ancient Arab. The next part of the verse is quoted&nbsp; for readers'&nbsp; interest:</span><font face="Arial, Helvetica" color="#003300"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#003300"><font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times"><br>

  <i>and the moon a light, and ordained for it mansions that you might know the 
  computation of years and the reckoning.<br>
  &nbsp;</i></p>
  </font>
  </font></font>
  </font>
  <p><span style="color: #003300">This portion is not miraculous at all. The ancient Arabs&nbsp; used sun and moon to 
  measure location and time. The lunar months and lunar years are quite commonly
  used by pastoral people. Interestingly, science has advanced so much nowadays
  that we do not need to use the moon for measuring time. Obviously
  &quot;miraculous&quot; Qur'an could not give any slightest </span>indication
  beforehand on this recent development<span style="color: #003300">.</span></p>

  <p><span style="color: #003300">The scientific Atomic&nbsp; theory have nothing to do with this Qur'anic Atom. 
  This atom is used in Qur'an to denote small particle. When Arabs tried to talk 
  about small particle, they could not find a suitable word to describe the 
  atom; only appropriate the word they imagined was &quot;zarah&quot; (</span><span class="postbody"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">dharra</span></span><span style="color: #003300">)

  [<a href="#3">3</a>]<br>
  &nbsp;</span></p>
	<p><span style="color: #003300">Particularly,
	<a href="http://www.tafsir.com/default.asp?sid=10&tid=22950">Ibn Kathir's 
	tafsir</a> on &quot;zarah&quot; (Q10:61) can be our interest : </span></p>

		<p>Neither you do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur'an, nor you

		speck of dust</b></i><span style="COLOR: red"> </span>on the earth or in 
		the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but 
		is (written) in a Clear Record.</p>
	</blockquote>
  <p><span style="color: #003300">If&nbsp; Qur'an really talked scientifically about atom and molecules, then we 
  should have some indication about electrons, protons neutrons. But there is no 
  real indication of it in the whole Qur'an. If any scientist claim that Qur'an 
  really talk about Atomic physics, then he must show us where we may get the 
  scientific idea of Nuclear structure, how can one observe Rutherford 
  scattering. How can one acquire the knowledge of Static properties of nucleus 
  such as angular momentum, parity, size shape, magnetic multiple moments, 
  electric multiple moments etc. and&nbsp; Dynamic properties such as nuclear 
  reaction etc. Neither we can get any idea from Qur'an about Strong interaction 
  model and weak interaction model, nor can we develop any well established 
  model such as Fermi degenerate gas model, Alpha particle model, Liquid drop 
  model, Shell model, Optical model, Collective model or compound nucleus model 
  using Qur'anic principle.&nbsp; Qur'an can only imagine very ambiguously small 
  particle as dust and the small ants. While Islamic scientists try to prove 
  Qur'an super-scientific, they usually try to get the words <i> out from it
  context</i> [<a href="#5">5</a>].</span></p>
	<p><span style="color: #003300">Again,&nbsp; if someone's prediction 
	on something implying this would be evidence of divine inspiration and 
	sounds supernatural then, Epicurus (341-270 BC) 
	predicted&nbsp; in his poetic summary De Rerum Natura the existence of the 
	atom and the molecule (the binding of two atoms to produce a different 
	chemical) far less ambiguous terms than anything purportedly prescient in 
	the Qur'an [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Following the same principle given by 
	Islamic scholars, should we consider Epicurus as a prophet or his book as 
	divine from now on? Even before Epicurus, around 440 BC, Leucippus of 
	Miletus originated the concept of atom. He and his pupil, Democritus (460-371 
	BC) of Abdera, refined and extended it in future years. There were five 
	major points to their atomic idea at that time. Epicurus, to be precise, 
	developed the work of Leucippus and Democritus and made the ideas more 
	generally known.&nbsp; Again, from ancient Indian philosophy we came to know about some 
	significant contributions that have been made by Indian philosophers as 
	well. Kanada, the founder of the <i>Vaisesika system of philosophy</i>, 
	expounded that the entire matter in this world consists of atoms long before 
	Muhammad came to the earth. The Tamil word for <i>atom</i> is “anu” (in 
	Bangla we also use the same) which is an ancient word, mentioned in Tamil 
	literatures in 600 AD and even earlier [<a href="#24">24</a>]! So, there is no reason to believe that Qur'an 
	written in later period of time was miraculously predicted certain claims on 
	atom now established by modern science. </span></p>

  must be much bigger and the Sun and the Moon are to be much smaller. They are 
  “lamps” hanging from the ceiling of the sky that is being supported by 
  invisible columns. Allah also described the heaven (sky) made of seven layers 
	and placed (wrongly) the stars in the lowest layer, i.e, lower than the

	<p>The universe as was envisioned by Muhammad/Allah, belongs to nothing but

	rebellious evil spirit', as being referred to in sura 21: 32 and sura 41:12, 
	etc. while writing his famous book <i>The Bible, the Qu'ran and Science</i>,&nbsp; 
	however he cleverly tried to avoid the topic saying, &quot;All these observations 
	seem to lie outside the subject of this study&quot; [<a href="#9">9</a>]&nbsp; 
	for obvious reason. The author also said that scientific data were unable to cast any

	but forgot to tell us what scientific data satisfied him when Qur'an said 
	that sun also must rose from muddy waters and entered in the murky waters 
  just as Jul Qaranain had witnessed (Q<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/018.qmt.html#018.086">18:86</a>,

	<p><span style="color: #003300">There&nbsp;is also a position for the throne of Allah

	Bukhari Volume 4, Book 54, Number 414</a><span style="color: #003300">) and the Sun has to prostrate in front of the throne

	<p>In his book, Bucaille repeatedly claimed, &quot;there is nothing in the text 
	of the Qur'an that contradicts what we know today&quot;, but above analysis with 
	authentic references from&nbsp; Qur'an and Hadith about modern cosmology 
	reveals that are nothing short of scientific heresies. Despite the desperate 
	attempt of Bucaille and some Muslim apologists [<a href="#14">14</a>] to 
	reinterpret and find some esoteric meaning hidden within these vague verse, 
	their obvious contrast with science, logic and common sense is enough to 
	realize that Qur'an cannot be founded by any divine inspiration. </p>

  </p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Let's see how Dr. William Campbell refuted the Qur'anic science of&nbsp; Bucaille 
	[<a href="#15">15</a>] 
  :</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dr. Bucaille declares that until the late sixteenth century &quot;man held 
    totally inaccurate views on the water cycle'', and considers that several 
    statements in the Qur'an which reflect a knowledge of the water cycle could 
    not therefore have come from any human source.</p>
    <p>He quotes Suras 50:9-11, 35:9, 30:48, 7:57, 25:48-49, and 45:5, as verses 
    which include steps (2), (3), and (4a). As an example 
    we will look at the Late Meccan Sura of the Heights (Al-A`rúf) 7:57,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>''(God) is the One Who sends forth the winds like heralds of His Mercy. 
      When they have carried (2) the heavy-laden clouds, We drive them to 
      a dead land. Then We cause (3) water to descend and thereby (4a) 
      bring forth fruits of every kind. Thus We will bring forth the dead. Maybe 
      you will remember.''</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To demonstrate step (4b) he brings verses from Suras 23:18-19, 
    15:22, and the Late Meccan Sura of The Crowds (Al-Zumar) 39:21 which reads,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>''Have you not seen that God sent water down from the sky and led it 
      through (4b) sources into the ground? Then he caused sown fields of 
      different colors to grow.''</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These verses are accurate, of course, but 
    the question is do they show special foreknowledge and thereby prove Divine 
    Revelation? The answer must surely be &quot;no''. Every man or woman, even those 
    living in a city, could describe steps (2), (3), and (4a). 
    And every person in contact with farmers during a drought will hear them say 
    that their wells and springs have dried up, thus showing common knowledge of 
    step (4b) that rain is the source and origin of underground water.</p>
    <p>But what of step (1) - evaporation as the source of rain clouds? This 
	would be much more difficult to understand by observation and it is 
	obviously could not be known by ancient people when Qur'an is revealed. But 
	Does Qur'an have any verse to clarify&nbsp; the evaporation process? 
	Unfortunately there is not a single verse to support the claim.&nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It can be pointed out that there is no end to the strange miracles Muslim 
	scholars are claiming. If one visits the prominent Islamic sites [<a href="#14">14</a>], 
	he will find hundreds of such bogus arguments.&nbsp; I guess it might not be 
	possible for me to rebut so many wild claims for shear lack of time and 
	interest and claim victory.&nbsp; However, many of my skeptic friends, in 
	parallel,&nbsp; are doing wonderful job in the Net. For example, Richard 
	Carrier debunked Dr. Mansour Hassab-Elnaby's claim on speed of light [<a href="#16">16</a>],&nbsp; 
	Ali Sina refuted Harun Yahya's claim on atmospheric layer [<a href="#17">17</a>], 
	Abul Kasem and Syed Kamran Mirza debunked the claim on mountains [<a href="#18">18</a>,
	<a href="#19">19</a>] etc. I will rest my case analyzing another miracle 
	which has been frequently quoted in Islamic web-sites in recent days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Islamic websites [<a href="#20">20</a>] have been propagating in
          recent years one particular example of the miraculous scientific

          Hubble Space Telescope on <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/1995/01/">January
          11, 1995</a>, but having reached the attention of the Muslims
          apparently when it was the featured image at <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap991031.html">the
          NASA web site</a> on October 31, 1999. Starting from that date, some
          Muslim discovered that this is may make a good miracle, spread the
          news tagged with the following verse of Qur'an:</p>

    the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide.” &nbsp;<O:P>

  </blockquote>
  <p>This verse, unfortunately&nbsp; has nothing to do with any Red Star Nebula. 
  Actually in this verse Islamic Allah (through his obedient prophet) was just trying to scare people with tales of 
  blazing fires and dreadful things. The above verse is therefore another one of Prophet's 
  scare mongering verses, when sky opens and becomes red (with fire), not any
  scientific miracles.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <p>A closer observation of the verses of the same sura chronologically from 55:26 to
  55:38&nbsp; gives us an impression that the author of Qur'an is trying to frighten
  people putting in mind about so-called <i>Judgment Day</i> [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Let's
  quote from Qur'an :</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Everyone that is thereon will pass away; There remaineth but the
  Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. Which is it, of the favours of
  your Lord, that ye deny? All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat
  Him. Every day He exerciseth (universal) power. Which is it, of the favours of
  your Lord, that ye deny? We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man and
  jinn). Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? O company of
  jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and
  the earth, then penetrate (them)! Ye will never penetrate them save with (Our)
  sanction. Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? There will
  be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye will not
  escape. Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? And when the
  heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide -Which is it, of the
  favours of your Lord, that ye deny? -On that day neither man nor jinni will be
  questioned of his sin.<br>
  <br>
  From the chunk stated above, these two particular verse could be our interest 
	where Allah clearly declares his future motivation settle our affairs (on Judgment 
	Day):
  <br>
  <br>
  <em><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/055.qmt.html#055.031">055.031</a></em><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> Soon shall We settle your affairs, O both ye
  worlds!<br>
  <strong>PICKTHAL:</strong> We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man
  and jinn).<br>
  <strong>SHAKIR:</strong> Soon will We apply Ourselves to you, O you two
  armies.</p>
  <p><em><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/055.qmt.html#055.039">055.039</a></em><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> On that Day no question will be asked of man or
  Jinn as to his sin.<br>
  <strong>PICKTHAL:</strong> On that day neither man nor jinni will be
  questioned of his sin.<br>
  <strong>SHAKIR:</strong> So on that day neither man nor jinni shall be asked
  about his sin.

  <p>Thus any rational person can conclude that there is no relation with red
  star nebula if we consider the context, however, Muslim scholars&nbsp;
  wishfully matched this up with the area of astrophysics.&nbsp; We all know that there are many Nebulas far&nbsp; far away from our planet.&nbsp;
  If we look at them with powerful telescopes, they will appear to be red 
  because it is going away from us. All stars are going away from us because the 
  universe is expanding and therefore they are red. This is famous Red shift
  that Hubble discovered. We, however,&nbsp; cannot see it in our 
  plain eyes; we only can see it through the most powerful telescopes. The reddish
  color of this particular Nebula of above picture, however is not the cause of
  expansion of space as explained; this particular picture was taken by the NASA
  Hubble Space Telescope of the &quot;Cat's Eye Nebula&quot;, an explosion of a
  supernova that took place 3,000 years ago. This is a glass hour explosion seen
  from the top. The photographs are taken by NASA actually in infrared or X-ray spectrum.
  Here in this particular picture, false colors are added applying
  color algorithm by NASA at the time of releasing. NASA has given this color to the picture
  red, but they
  virtually could have given any color. So whole argument of relating with
  Qur'anic dicta -&quot;rosy like red hide&quot; becomes meaningless&nbsp; [<a href="#22">22</a>].</p>
  <p>Aparthib [<a href="#23">23</a>] also has written quite a number of articles
  so far refuting such Islamic&nbsp; pseudo-scientific claims i.e on attempting to
  relate vague verses of Qur'an with modern scientific 
  inventions. I remember in one particular response to an apologist claiming such vague &quot;miracle&quot;, Aparthib once wrote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I see an attempt here to link planetary nebulae with a religious verse. 
    This is a flawed attempt that is often made by apologetics of all religions, 
    some more than others. If one likes to see science in anything they can see 
    it anywhere. Some Joe may have said &quot;All is relative&quot; before Einstein's 
    theory of relativity. By this stretch of imagination that Joe can 
    legitimately claim that he already knew about relativity and claim 
    originality. Any vague phrase, pun, quote etc. by humans, scriptures etc. can 
    be customized and made to fit any scientific principle which also have been 
    phrased in a very general way for popular consumption hiding the underlying 
    precise sense of these principles. Its an insult to science and the 
    scientists whose painstaking research has helped unravel the complex 
    workings of the laws of nature and reality. None of these scientific 
    revelations were inspired from, dependent on, or utilized any of the 
    religious revelations. If religious revelations could not and did not lead 
    to any of these scientific truths in a stand alone way then by any criterion 
    and logic they cannot be used to corroborate science. There are many 
    unanswered questions in the basic understanding of the universe. Why can't 
    the verses of scripture throw any light on them? For example we don't at 
    this time know for sure if the universe is closed, open or flat. No body 
    dares to make a prediction based on any revelation. But if it is ever found 
    out by science I am sure one can dig out some vague words of a verse from 
    some book of some religion and claim to &quot;see&quot; the answer that science has 
    finally managed to find. Its always AFTER the fact that 
    these semblances are found. It has never been found BEFORE the scientific 
    discovery. Is that a 
    coincidence?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Then Aparthib went on saying&nbsp; 
  -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Nobel laureate Physicist 
    Dr. Abdus Salam warned against people trying to explain Big Bang using 
    verses from Koran, saying that the current version of Big Bang is the best 
    known scientific explanation for the creation of the universe. What if a 
    better scientific explanation than Big Bang is found tomorrow? Should the 
    verses be changed to accommodate the new scientific view? Religion can never 
    vindicate or falsify science. The truth or falsity of a scientific principle 
    lies within science itself. Religious scriptures cannot 
    speak of any scientific principle. Religious revelations are absolute 
    directives and narratives for humans to follow as faith unquestioningly. 
    Many revelations clearly contradict many accepted scientific principles. 
    No scientist of any repute have ever tried to substantiate scientific 
    principles by religious beliefs. Most scientists and theologians would 
    rather not mix faith with objective and rational field of science. 
    Koran/Bible/Gita etc are not books of science. Any coincidental vague 
    semblance between a verse and a popular phrasing of a complex scientific 
    principle is solely due to the very general and vague wordings admitting of 
    any interpretation that one chooses to impose on it. All one needs is some 
    vague reverse fitting argument to connect the two. One can find Quantum 
    Mechanics in Tagore's poems, or relativity in the Buddhist Monk Nagarjun's 
    writing. Just seeing what one likes to see because of a preset belief in a favored
    belief system doesn't make it so by any objective criterion. My 
    purpose is not to disrespect religion or its revelation, but to question the 
    attempt to reconcile the two in an illogical way. They can be irreconcilable 
    and yet can continue and thrive as separate ways as long as one does not get 
    in the way of the pursuit of the other.</p>

  <p>While debating in many Bangladeshi internet forums, I have seen Modern
  educated Muslims love to cite many of such alleged scientific miracles in the Qur'an to
  give a divine origin of their faith. In this two-part essay, top ten of these claims have been debunked.
  I hope my attempt will give a better understanding that no supernatural supreme
  being&nbsp; gave any kind of&nbsp; scientific information to Muhammad. Those
  alleged miracles in Qur'an simply fail as any sort of reasonable or rational
  argument in favor of any kind of divine source. No sensible person or
  freethinker should&nbsp; be swayed by such divine claims.</p>
