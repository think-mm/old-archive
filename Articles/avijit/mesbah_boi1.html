<p>Dear Mesbah Uncle:</p>
<p>Yes it is possible to send your newsletter to the recipients. I emailed you 
earlier showing how to do. This is quite simple you have to keep the page in any 
we-site and then cut and paste the whole thing in your email while you send. For 
example,&nbsp; I kept the stuff I sent to you in the following link :</p>
<p><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/alo_hate/book/ankur_add.html">
https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/alo_hate/book/ankur_add.htm</a></p>
<p>Let me know whether you could view properly in your mailbox.</p>
<p>Thanks for including my book in Frankfurt Book Catalog.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, of 
course you can announce the news in MM. Please send me the message (within 1000 
words or so) mentioning everything you want to get published.</p>
<p>&nbsp;No I have not started translating Vinci Code. I am in the last phase of 
my phd program. I cant find time for writing. However, there are some members of 
mukto-mona who can take charge, if I request. But&nbsp; let me know your 
remuneration plan w/ the translator(s). I will let them know...</p>
<p>Its nice to know that 300 copies of my book have almost sold-out within a 
short time. Please start concentrating on 2nd edition as soon as possible, 
because this time I wish the book will be ready long before the February book 
fair. Please show the manuscript to my father in advance to ensure that each and 
every figures and footnotes are in the appropriate places. I changed/modified 
many portions. Hence some footnotes/pictures might get displaced. Also please 
get in touch with&nbsp; a professional proof reader after everything has been 
finalized. Sometimes our inexperienced eyes overlook some silly mistakes.</p>
<p>I am giving a CC to my father as well.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Avijit</p>
