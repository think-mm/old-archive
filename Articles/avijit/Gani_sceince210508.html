	<font face="Verdana">Discussion on science and religion is a central topic 
	in MM for a while. MM has provided a unique platform so that variant views 
	on Science and religion can seek common ground through ongoing dialogue. 
	Such dialogue has become so popular that we are planning to publish a Bangla 
	Book named, &quot;<a style="color: #247CD4; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/call_for_article030408.html">Biggan 
	O Dhormo: Shonghat, Naki Shomonnoy?</a>&quot; which is expected to get published

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
14.4pt"><font face="Verdana">For a long time, the dominant viewpoint at least 
	among scientists and skeptics has been that science and religion are 
	incompatible. &nbsp;Like many other mukto-mona members, I belong to this group. 
	In recent years the opposite viewpoint has tended to be more popular (and 
	not surprisingly, there have been quite a lot of money and media attentions 
	available for scholars interested in arguing in favor of the 
	pro-compatibility position as well). &nbsp;Mr. Gani&#39;s thought is inline with the 
	second group. &nbsp;Nevertheless, I would like to thank Mr. Gani for penning his 
	thought on this issue to maintain the ongoing dialogue. I would also like to 
	thank him for participating in MM forum, even though just few days ago he 
	accused MM for following the &quot;dumping practice&quot;.&nbsp; It is quite pleasing and 
	perhaps amusing to see his articles are continuously being published in that 
	forum, for which he posses so much hate that he compared that with &quot;KKK&quot;. I 
	would be interested to know that while this &quot;KKK forum&quot; and the moderators 
	having &quot;racial attitude&quot; is publishing his article on regular basis, how 
	many Islamic newspaper and sites he has seen that have the courage to 
	publish the opposing views. Anyway, after my clarification, I am sure he 
	realized that he was wrong on his assumption on Mukto-Mona. Today, I will 
	show his recent article &quot;<a style="color: #247CD4; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none; text-line-through: none" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/48208">Science

	Mr. Gani&#39;s article</a> and many similar articles such as this. Such

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><b>In the first step</b>, the authors start with 
	typical `God in Gaps&#39; argument – i.e., try to poke holes in science and then 
	stuff their God into them. Their typical argument is - &quot;Science cannot 
	explain that, cannot do this&quot;, and then conclude, &quot;God did this&quot; or if put 
	in a more humble way, &quot;There must be a place for God in science&quot;. Thus, they 
	think they have accomplished a first step of the mission of reconciling 
	science with supernatural. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
14.4pt"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><b>As a second step</b>, these “premise keepers” 
	will try to reconcile their particular faith with recent scientific 
	advancements. If one is brought up in an Islamic faith, he will find Big 
	Bang in Quran, if he is a Christian, he will find Black holes in Biblical 
	verses, and if the person is Hindu, he will find `time dilation&#39; in Vedic 
	slokes etc. After doing such `eminent research&#39; in reconciling, he would 
	eventually conclude that it was indeed a miracle to have the advanced 
	scientific information in such so-and so-ancient holly books; it must be the 
	act of God. Here he attempts to reconcile his particular brand of religious 
	faith with science. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
14.4pt"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
14.4pt"><font face="Verdana"><b>Lastly</b>, they will find eminent design and 
	creation in every place he goes or whatever verses he reads from scripture; 
	he would therefore justify his faith, not only on God, but also his personal 
	brand of religion at the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>

	many others, this is not an argument; this is actually an argument from 
	ignorance: &quot;Since we don&#39;t know how this happened, it must mean God did it.&quot; 
	Yet ignorance is never an argument and cannot be considered evidence in any 
	meaningful sense. I will show that most of the arguments that he formulated 
	in his piece, is nothing but ‘argument from Ignorance’. This is what Mr.

	<font face="Verdana">&quot;Science has no room for creating something from 
	nothing and our theory of &quot;Infinite Density Mass and Zero Volume&quot; theory 
	(known as Singularity) as science describes; has many fundamental flaws….. 
	This is not the end of the puzzle; our cosmology also has its own problem; 
	like where does &quot;mass&quot; come from, at the most fundamental level?.... Science 
	cannot answer these questions, because in the first moments of its existence 
	the universe was probably compressed to such an extraordinary degree and 
	consumed by the heat of a fire beyond human imagination!&quot;</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
14.4pt"><font face="Verdana">First of all, if science cannot answer &quot;these 
	questions&quot;, then please admit that no theology, no religion can claim to 
	give any better or perfect answer either. If anything we can predict coming 
	out with the proper answer, it will be ‘science’. In fact in the past we 
	have seen how science falsified various religious claims (six days creation, 
	earth-centric solar system, age of earth, various fancy creation stories 
	etc) and came out with correct answers. The old creationists take the Bible 
	literally and are forced to conclude that much of science is wrong. Even 
	today many religionists put &quot;Adam Eve&quot; story or some religious holy verse as 
	an evidence to oppose evolution. However, needless to say, scientific 
	evidences are going entirely opposite direction refuting all such fancy 
	religious claims. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt;text-align:justify;line-height:
14.4pt"><font face="Verdana">If any rational person look at the past 100 years 
	of scientific advancement and he will notice that scientists were indeed 
	able to solve many such puzzles which were thought to be impossible. Down 
	through the centuries, science has eliminated a great many of its gaps. 
	People who had used the Gap argument were embarrassed, since their God 
	shrank in power with each new scientific advance. For anything cold not be 
	explained by science was thought to be guided by supernatural causes indeed. 
	For example it was not known before Newton how earth hangs upon nothing in 
	space circling around the sun. Many people must have thought of a mysterious 
	&quot;supernatural force&quot; behind it. </font></p>

14.4pt"><font face="Verdana">Anyway, origin of matter and universe is not as 
	`divine&#39; as Mr. Gani suggests, at least if we consider the results coming 
	from current cosmological researches.&nbsp; The origin of matter has been well 
	explained through current &#39;cosmic inflation&#39; theory, suggested by Alan Guth 
	and Linde. It shows how the universe can have formed from nothing, in 
	complete chaos (maximum entropy), and have order form spontaneously, without 
	violating any known principles of physics. That is, it provides an 
	economical explanation of the origin of the universe without creation or 
	design. A creator is not required by the data. Alan Guth has also written a 
	book for general readers: &quot;The inflationary Universe&quot; which is highly 
	recommended from my side. If anyone wants to go into deeper level, here are 
	some other papers from scientific journal that have explained the topic in 
	detail:</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">The universe currently contains a large amount of 
	matter that is characterized by the physical quantity we define as mass. 
	Prior to the twentieth century, it was believed that matter could neither be 
	created nor destroyed, just changed from one type to another. So the very 
	existence of matter seemed to be a miracle, a violation of the assumed law 
	of conservation of mass that occurred just once—at the creation.</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">However, in his special theory of relativity published 
	in 1905, Albert Einstein showed that matter can be created out of energy and 
	can disappear into energy. ….So, the existence of mass in the universe 
	violates no law of nature. It can come from energy. But, where does the 
	energy come from? One of the most important principles of physics is the law 
	of conservation of energy, also known as the first law of thermodynamics, 
	which requires that energy come from somewhere. In principle, the creation 
	hypothesis could be confirmed by the direct observation or theoretical 
	requirement that conservation of energy was violated 13.7 billion years ago 
	at the start of the big bang. </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">However, neither observations nor theory indicate this 
	to have been the case. The first law allows energy to convert from one type 
	to another as long as the total for a closed system remains fixed. 
	Remarkably, the sum of the rest kinetic energies of the bodies in the early 
	universe seems to have been exactly cancelled by the negative potential

	substance of universe and nothing interpreted as a state of &quot;zero&quot; energy, 
	then modern physics has precisely shown that the total kinetic energy of 
	motion for universe is exactly balanced by the negative energy of gravity. 
	This has also been very clearly explained in the following passage of 
	Stephen Hawking&#39;s famous book &quot;The Brief History of Time&quot; (1988, p 129):</font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">There are something like ten million million million 
	million million million million million million million million million 
	million million (1 with eighty [five] zeroes after it) particles in the 
	region of the universe that we can observe. Where did they all come from? 
	The answer is that, in quantum theory, particles can be created out of 
	energy in the form of particle/antiparticle pairs. But that just raises the 
	question of where the energy came from. The answer is that the total energy 
	of the universe is exactly zero. The matter in the universe is made out of 
	positive energy. However, the matter is all attracting itself by gravity. 
	Two pieces of matter that are close to each other have less energy than the 
	same two pieces a long way apart, because you have to expend energy to 
	separate them against the gravitational force that is pulling them together. 
	Thus, in a sense, the gravitational field has negative energy. In the case 
	of a universe that is approximately uniform in space, one can show that this 
	negative gravitational energy exactly cancels the positive energy 
	represented by the matter. So the total energy of the universe is zero”.

	universe; as according to Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity, the energy of a 
	gravitational field is negative. The energy of matter, however, is positive. 
	So the entire universe-creation scenario could unfold without breaking 
	conservation-of-energy laws. The positive energy of all matter in the 
	universe could be precisely counterbalanced by the negative energy of all 
	the gravity in the universe. Again, speaking in physicists’ simpler &nbsp;terms, 
	if the net energy cost of inflating universe is zero, then nothing needs to 
	be added from outside. The energy accounting books that are internal to the 
	system balance. In these terms, it takes no energy at all to get a universe, 
	and no thermodynamic work needs to be done (see Guth and Steinhardt, 1989, 
	The Inflationary Universe, New Physics etc.). &nbsp;And, the zero total energy is 
	now an observational fact. This is also the prediction of inflationary 
	cosmology, which is strongly supported by observation too. </font></p>

	Inflation</i> holds that in its very early infancy the universe underwent a 
	brief but stupendous growth spurt before settling down and in the same basic 
	mechanism spawned not only the observable universe--the galaxy-emblazoned 
	realm we ponder through our telescopes--but also countless other universes 
	being branched off from our own, universes that we are not able to see, and 
	possibly we’ll never see. Besides this multiverse theory (through chaotic 
	inflation) two other theories are competing with each other to focus the 
	origin of the Universe. One is the latest elaboration of Steinhardt and 
	Turok&#39;s cyclic cosmology spearheaded by Evgeny Buchbinder of Perimeter 
	Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, and was published 
	last December. In their popular level book for general readers, - ‘Endless 
	Universe: Beyond the Big Bang’ (Doubleday, 2007) Steinhardt and Turok 
	explained their proposal of a “cyclic universe” model, in which our Big Bang 
	is just one act in an eternal cycle of expansion and contraction. A trillion 
	years from now, by their calculations, space, time, and matter will crunch 
	down into another fireball and reemerge as another Big Bang. For eternity, 
	the universe will swing between Big Bang and Big Crunch, a cosmic pendulum 
	clock that never winds down. The latest version of the cyclic model even 
	matches key pieces of observational evidence supporting the view. The 
	another theory and the most radical one off course, rebel physicist Julian 
	Barbour&#39;s &nbsp;publication - The End of Time—a manifesto suggesting that 
	attempts to address what came before the Big Bang were based on a 
	fundamental mistake. There is no need to find a solution to time&#39;s 
	beginning, Barbour insisted, because time does not actually exist.&nbsp; While we 
	have to wait for the next generation of ground-based observatories and space 
	missions, that is expected to provide more clues about the correct theory 
	that will prevail in the long run, nevertheless, one thing is clear - no 
	theory needs any supernatural intervention for justification of our origin 
	and the physical reality of our universe. </font></p>

	<b>SPACE-TIME SINGULARITY</b> (not matter). Matter was not even created when 
	Big Bang happened. Earth was formed billions of years after the Big Bang. 
	The above verses are clearly referring to earth and sky being &quot;joined&quot; 
	(which doesn&#39;t even have a common sense or scientific meaning) together and 
	then being split apart (again no scientific or common sense meaning), forget

	<span lang="EN-GB">A scientifically and common sensually meaningless

	separated&quot;</i>&nbsp; cannot be suggested as hinting to the scientific facts of 
	Big Bang!&nbsp;In fact, why the idea is put in such form in Qur&#39;an can be easily 
	guessed. Such kind of idea that the heavens and earth were once joined and 
	then separated by the activity of Gods and Goddesses was actually quite 
	common among pagans of the Middle East. Among the Egyptians for example, it 
	was the involuntary separation of Geb (the earth god) from his wife and 
	sister Nut (the sky goddess) that was responsible for the division of the 
	earth from the sky. The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh likewise describes the 
	moment &quot;when the heavens had been separated from the earth, when the earth 
	had been delimited from the heavens&quot; as a result of the separation of a sky 
	God (An) from a earth Goddess (Ki). If you remove the pagan references, you

	<span lang="EN-GB">Again, from Quantum theory we know that moments after the

	electromagnetic and gravity were combined as a single &quot;super force&quot; (Wald). 
	Where are those indications in those verses of Qur&#39;an? How can someone 
	derive Hubble&#39;s Constant from those verses ? How can some one calculate red

	add, Nobel laureate Physicist Dr. Abdus Salam once warned us against people 
	trying to explain Big Bang using verses from </span>Qur&#39;an<span lang="EN-GB">, 
	saying that the current version of Big Bang is the best known scientific 
	explanation for the creation of the universe. Same concern was shown by 
	astronomer/priest Georges-Henri Lemaître, who first proposed the idea of a 
	big bang, wisely advised the Pope not to make this statement &quot;infallible&quot;, 
	when Pope Pius XII tried to relate Big-bang with Bible. Both Salam and 
	Lemaître understood the problem -what if a better scientific explanation 
	than Big Bang is found tomorrow? Should the verses be changed to accommodate 
	the new scientific view? Certainly it is not possible; thus it shows the 
	inherent contradiction such attempt leads to. Religious revelations can 
	never vindicate or falsify science. The truth or falsity of a scientific

14.4pt"><font face="Verdana">In fact, if you read the creation story depicted in 
	Quran or Bible carefully, you will see it looks nothing like Big Bang 
	cosmology—no matter how one spins it. In the Quran, the universe is a 
	firmament and Earth is fixed and immovable (not to mention flat). In 
	reality, the universe is expanding and Earth rotates about the sun. Both 
	Quran and Bible claim that everything has been created in six days. From 
	Biblical Genesis, Earth is created in the first &quot;day,&quot; before the sun, moon, 
	and stars. In reality, Earth did not form until nine billion years after the 
	Big Bang and after the sun and many other stars. Allah also described the 
	heaven (sky) made of seven layers and placed (wrongly) the stars in the 
	lowest layer i.e., lower than the Moon. Qur&#39;an said that the Sun also must 
	arise from the muddy waters and must enter the murky waters just as Zul 
	Qaranain had witnessed. The Qur&#39;anic solar system also contains the 
	invisible Jinns. These Jinns, according to Qur&#39;an are made of fire and they 
	climb over each other’s shoulders and reach the heaven to eavesdrop the 
	conversation of the “Exalted Assembly”. But the most interesting part is 
	that Allah believed that the shooting stars and the meteors are the missiles 
	thrown at the eavesdropping Jinns. These ancient fairy-tales depicted in 
	Quran is far from common sense or reality, let alone be related with modern 
	cosmology. </font></p>

	<font face="Verdana">&quot;I believe in God not to rescue myself just from the 
	misery of death; not to justify my hedonistic desires or to triumph over the 
	evil. I believe in a Creator (God) because I see the creation around me 
	everyday. I see all its order, I see the existence and I see the creativity. 
	What could create orders those are not ordered? What could create existence 
	that does not exist? The overall philosophy of science has given me the 
	understanding to believe that it is not within sciences realm to prove or to 
	disprove God and also that it is wholly unscientific to believe that science 
	in any measure discounts God and His divinity. To the contrary, science 
	suggests the implementation of all elements of our knowledge and wisdom more 
	advanced and forcefully than our own mind in explaining our existence. Thus 
	it would be a brutal scientific irresponsibility if we conveniently use 
	(abuse) philosophy of science to disprove the existence of creator (God).&quot;</font></p>

	naturally, so it must be an act of God. He cannot see how the universe 
	became orderly by natural processes, so order must have come about by 
	supernatural processes. He cannot see how the physical laws can be 
	originated, so it must be divine. &nbsp;In each of these cases&nbsp;I can give a 
	plausible natural explanation that requires no divine actions. None can show 
	in proving these natural explanations wrong. </font></p>

	beyond childhood. We no longer need to depend on imaginary fairy-tales or a 
	mythical sky-father to provide for our explanations or needs. We can take

	with the universe revealed to us by reason and science.</font></p>

	Gani believes in a Creator (God) because he ‘sees the creation around’ him 
	everyday. Unfortunately, I do not. If an all-good, all-powerful, and 
	all-knowing God existed, he could posses the power to comfort a child dying 
	an excruciating death from leukemia or cancer. He chooses not to do so. 
	Moreover, humans cannot be held responsible for a massive flood, earthquake, 
	plague or Tsunami. In fact, we can explain such calamities only by 
	concluding that God is malevolent, because he knew of terrible destructive 
	events to occur. It suggests that God is impotent to prevent evil. Needless 
	to say, this would also suggest an unintelligent, deficient, faulty or evil 
	designer, no doubt. The most logical position for me- such evil God does not 
	exist at all. </font></p>
