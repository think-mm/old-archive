The Quran is largely a book of theological poetry, and these ideas about 
physiology are, should we say poetic. This article might be better suited for a 
journal concerned with the history of medicine. Some of this article’s claims 
are still preposterous. </font></p>

focus is more on technology. Some argue that the lost island of Atlantis had 
technology more advanced than ours, and some say similar things about ancient 
Egypt. Often it's extra-terrestrials who are given credit for giving these 
ancient civilizations their advanced technologies. There's a kind of Golden Age 
mythology that seems to run through these notions. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Dear Editor; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I just read an essay The heart and cardiovascular system in the Qur'an and 
Hadeeth written by Marios Loukas, Yousuf Saad, R. Shane Tubbs and Mohamadali M. 
Shojawhich. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Your decision to publish such a “voodoo Science” is bound to affect your 
reputation. My conjecture is very soon, the Christians, the Jews, the Hindus and 
the Voodoo practitioners in Africa and the charm and amulet dealers in all parts 
of the world may submit their claims of modern medical science in their trades.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The author of the above essay has cited a few verses from the Qur’an and 
ahadith to demonstrate scientific materials related to human heart in those 
verses. I will say this simply is not true. Anyone who reads these verses will 
have no doubt that the verses almost invariably refer to the stubbornness of the 
infidels who do not to open their hearts to Islam or to demonstrate the peace 
and tranquillity that descends when a person embraces Islam. I urge you to read 
the referred verses to judge for yourself the veracity of my statement. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Now, here are a few examples from the Qur’an:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Allah sealed the hearts of the non&#8209;believers, and put veils on their eyes; 
there is a great penalty for the non&#8209;believers. (Qur'an 2:7). </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">One of the most eminent scholars of the Qur'an, ibn Kathir writes that the 
seal is placed on the heart and the hearing; Allah has sealed their hearts 
because of their unbelief. Another eminent scholar of the Qur'an, ibn Abbas 
says: This refers in particular to the Jews Ka'b Ibn al&#8209;Ashraf, Huyayy Ibn 
Akhtab and Judayy Ibn Akhtab. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The hypocrites have disease in their hearts, Allah has increased the disease, 
and there is a grievous punishment for them. (Qur'an 2:10). Ibn Kathir writes 
disease means doubt. Ibn Abbas says: the reference is to the hypocrites: 
Abdullah ibn Ubayy, Jadd Ibn Qays and Mu'attib Ibn Qushay. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The Muslims should muster all their power and might, including steeds of war 
(tanks, planes, missiles…etc.) to strike terror in the hearts of the unbelievers 
(Qur'an 8:6). Ibn Abbas says this means killing them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Where is the modern medical condition of the heart in these verses? Mind you, 
I just cited only three verses from the Qur’an to demonstrate the utter 
untruthfulness of the author of the essay. The Qur'an is littered with hundreds 
of such hateful verses. How can we relate these hateful verses to modern medical 
science? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Many such similar passages are found in the Ahadith as well. For example, in 
a hadith we note that Muhammad had used “camel’s urine” as a medicine. Do you 
think we should now resort to drinking camels’ urine just because Islamic texts 
recommend it? Will you allow an essay extolling the virtues of drinking camels’ 
urine in your journal? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Your decision to publish such a misleading and completely unscientific essay 
is utterly imprudent and highly regrettable. It will simply embolden religious 
bigotry and encourage the Islamist terrorists. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Dear Sir, </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I am a Ph.D. in biological science and worked many years in the U.S. with 
research animals and I am quite familiar with the anatomy, physiology and 
pathology of humans and most research animals. I have recently came across an 
amazingly controversial paper: 'The heart and cardiovascular system in the 
Qur'an and Hadeeth' (Marios Loukas, Yousuf Saad, R. Shane Tubbs and Mohamadali 
M. Shojawhich) and surprisingly this fraudulently crafted article claimed to be 
peer reviewed and accepted for publication by the Editorial Board of your well 
reputed journal. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I am surprised as well as appalled to see how a reputed journal like yours is 
going to publishing or even accepting a deceitfully crafted article which has 
been written based on 100% false claims of science in Quran or Hadiths. This 
article is an absolutely illusionary dream by some cunning Islamists only to 
fool westerners. I can bet million dollars that nothing can be proven true about 
their claims by an impartial scrutiny of Quran and hadiths, if you desire to 
conduct any such independent investigation. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I have thoroughly read Islamic religious book of Quran and also Islamic 
tradition called Hadiths for the last 20 years. I have found this Quran and 
Hadiths are really silly books loaded with plenty of mumbo-jumbos of utterly 
superstitious crap. I have found Quran and hadiths are full of contradictions 
and errors in scientific, historical, ethical, moral, and political matters. 
These books are also full with utter hateful scriptural verses against all non-muslims. 
I have written many full size articles with Quran and hadiths depicting 
monumental errors and contradictions in the Quran. You can read one such article 
here: </font></p>

	<a href="https://enblog.mukto-mona.com/?p=54">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/wordpress/?p=54</a>&nbsp; 
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I am quite positive that the peer-reviewers of your journal either never read 
and checked the authenticity of any Quranic verse that authors claimed, or they 
have simply believed by the utter deceptively and fraudulently distortions of 
Quranic verses or hadith by their (authors) wishful manipulations. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">These wishful Islamists (authors) have deceived you by selective (pick &amp; 
choose) verses, taking part of the verse, sometimes by changing the actual 
words, adding non-existing words etc, they intentionally twist or manipulate the 
commonly accepted meanings of verses—to prove science in Quran. Who has ever 
heard about scientific theory in any religious book? Is any religion really 
compatible with the modern science? I thought, religion and science are like oil 
and water which never mix together! Please read this article here: http://www.islam-watch.org/SyedKamranMirza/Nostalgia-of-Islamic-Golden-Age.htm 
only to learn that, ancient luminaries of Islamic kingdom did not get their 
scientific ideas from Koran or Hadiths at all; instead they all got it from the 
ancient Indian, Greek and Chinese sources. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Their claims about Quranic embryology is a pure joke and full of 
superstitious craps. Please read this article about Quranic embryology here:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">
	<a href="http://www.islam-watch.org/SyedKamranMirza/Quran-Human-Embryology.htm">http://www.islam-watch.org/SyedKamranMirza/Quran-Human-Embryology.htm</a>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I urge you to investigate the real source the so called Holy Quran and 
hadiths for accuracies of their claims. I wonder why your “cutting age” journal 
could accept such fraudulently written article without any proper investigation 
of the source. While I understand that accepting or publishing any article in 
your reputed journal is purely your prerogative but I fervently request you to 
do your peer-review investigation one more time. Please ask them to submit all 
the Quranic verses and hadiths ( in original) and make an independent 
investigations by non-muslim scientists (not by Mullahs) and find the truth 
about this article. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Quran is replete with hateful harsh and unethical cruel verses against non-muslims. 
You can read some samples here: <br>

	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">This utterly fraudulent article if you publish will surely give a giant leap 
of propaganda tool in the hands of cunning Islamists. Also please consider 
that—by publishing such fraudulent article in your reputed journal will only 
embolden the religious zeal of Islamic terrorists further to destroy our 
civilization. And of course, your journal will surely lose its prestige in the 
international scientific community. Thanks for your understanding.<br><br>

		<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Publishing such a 
		tale-tell has definitely raised the question of the quality (reliability 
		&amp; validity) of this journal. Trying to save face of the diminishing 
		respect of Islam and Muslims to the present-day world of reasons has 
		simply added more mockery to it. The article contradicts how the science 
		is done. The very statement 'revelation' is a misrepresentation of the 
		fact that Islam is one of the three religions that came into being from 
		the same feudal family to compete each other. Also the practices and so 
		called science of the prophet Muhammad described in this article can be 
		transparently considered as plagiarism for it has been described in many 
		early texts for example, 'Manisanghita' about 5 thousand years ago 
		practiced by Aryan monks before the doctrine of Islam came to Middle 
		East. Nevertheless, the authors desecrated the holy books by aligning 
		them with science. Science is the claim from evidence and so a rational 
		domain of human being. I would respect Al-Brunni as the then front line 
		member of scientists from Middle East. Advising with no observations and 
		facts garnered is not a science itself rather than authoritarian views. 
		Science never spews hatred against the nature but just read the comments 
		of a real devout Muslim professor from Australia who has simply cited a 
		few verses to support the terrorism against non-believers. How the 
		authors claim the Quoran and Hadith as per with science? Science is not 
		an absolute but dynamic and skeptical that changes with new findings. Do 
		'Quoran' and 'Hadith' mandate this nature of science? Dreaded it might 
		be if that is so as we have seen in many incidents that almost knocked 
		the very world peace. take for man example, Taslima Nasreen -- a female 
		medical doctor and rational scientist herself is facing the Islamic 
		sword on her neck because she asked for change of 'Quoran' &amp; Islamic 
		practices in view of the present day needs. How then these authors 
		mischievously try to describe the statements from an authoritarian 
		scriptures as science. To me they themselves are complete ignorant of 
		what it is that is called science. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">My advice with these 
		authors would be to avoid this pseudo-science and rather stand strongly 
		against the heinous terrorists to wash the smeared hands of Islam with 
		dignity. </font></p>

		appearing online in the International Journal of Cardiology , published 
		by Elsevier, caught my attention. I request that you retract these two 
		papers from both online and print versions of your prestigious journal.&nbsp;
		</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
		<font face="Garamond" size="4">I am a biomedical scientist with a PhD 
		working in a prestigious research institute, and having had published 
		over 80 scientific papers, mostly in peer reviewed, international 
		scientific journals. These journals include such reputable ones as the 
		Journal of Biological Chemistry, PLoS Pathogens, Biochemistry, and the 
		Journal of Molecular Biology. My most recent paper appeared in the 
		Elsevier journal, Analytical Biochemistry. </font></p>
	<p align="justify">
		<font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;As the name International Journal of 
		Cardiology suggests, I found all the articles, as can be found in the 
		current ‘free sample copy’, deal with scientific research related to the 
		heart, except the two articles cited above. These two articles address 
		neither science nor scientific investigation, but quotes religious 
		scriptures and practices to glorify the religion. Being born to the 
		faith, I am pretty well educated in both Quran and Hadeeth, and find no 
		science in them except self-contradictions, but will refrain to 
		elaborate since that is not my field of research. The two articles may 
		be more suited for one of many other journals including Religion and 
		History of European Ideas both published by Elsevier. I found no 
		theology experts in the list of your editorial staff nor did I find a 
		scope of religious discussion in this prestigious journal. Unless you 
		expanded the stated scope, “both basic research and clinical papers”, of 
		the journal to include non-scientific literature, I am surprised that 
		these two papers passed the peer review process. &nbsp;<br>
		As in the middle and dark ages, religion has always been an impediment 
		to scientific progress. Even in today’s world of religious ‘tolerance’, 
		clergies are found to deliver hateful sermons against those engaged in 
		scientific research, and being publicized in the electronic media. The 
		problem is so acute, that I do not wish to expose my identity in writing 
		this comment because of fear of my life! I believe publishing these two 
		articles in your journal will do a great disservice to the scientific 
		community and science. Must the above religious articles appear in your 
		journal, I will reconsider submitting any of my scientific papers in any 
		of the Elsevier journals. I am sure many of my colleagues in my renowned 
		biomedical research institute of 700-plus strength and my peers 
		elsewhere, will follow me.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">
		<font face="Garamond" size="4">I therefore respectfully request that you 
		reconsider publishing these papers in your journal. &nbsp;I also request that 
		you do not make my email address public.<br>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I was quite disappointed 
	to know that the manuscript entitled “The heart and cardiovascular system in 
	the Qur&#39;an and Hadeeth” by Marios Loukas et al was e-published in the 
	International Journal of Cardiology. This pseudoscience paper describes the 
	cardiovascular system in the Qur&#39;an and Hadeeth. One can however find this 
	sort of trivial description of human body or the cardiovascular system 
	available in almost all ancient cultures and civilizations (Hindu, Muslim, 
	Chinese, Mayan, African etc). I, myself being an editor of several journals 
	in clinical and health sciences, failed to understand as to how this sort of 
	pseudoscience could survive the scientific peer review process in your 
	esteemed journal. I therefore wonder whether we will see more of such papers 
	in your journal. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I question your journal’s 
	ethical standing on the pseudoscience like this one as your journal is 
	committed to publish papers on basic and clinical research in cardiology and 
	serve the interest of both practicing clinicians and research workers. I was 
	therefore shocked to see the pseudoscience paper published in your journal. 
	In my opinion, by publishing this sort of paper you have compromised the 
	reputation of your journal very badly. Most importantly you have given the 
	opportunity to the religious fanatics to exploit this to strengthen their 
	propaganda machinery. <br>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Hi<br>
	We know that your journal is being read hundreds of thousands of medical 
	students, engineering students, heart specialists all over the world. You 
	had placed yourself in a very high peak of popularity among the readers but 
	after going through your published article Ref. 2, I am surprised that how 
	an internationally renowned journal like yours can publish unscientific 
	article which is without any hard core scientific analysis. It seems that, ” 
	The heart and cardiovascular system in the Qur’an and Hadeeth “, was written 
	by some Madrasa teachers. It describes poorly about heart, blood system, 
	etc. but preaches Koran, Hadeeth and Mohammad(PBUH). It seems to be a more 
	religious article rather than a medical article.<br>
	So you have started publishing religious article in your medical journal 
	where we expect articles based on experiment, research and with innovative 
	thoughts.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4"><br>
	<i>The heart is mentioned numerous times in both the Qur’an and<br>
	Hadeeth and is used in many different contexts, such as “in the<br>
	heart” or “from the heart.” The repetitive use of the concept of the<br>
	heart illustrates its centrality to the core of every individual. Firstly,<br>
	the importance of the heart is demonstrated in the fact that we find<br>
	different states of the heart in the three groups of people that the<br>
	Qur’an describes; the mu’minun (Believers) have hearts that are<br>
	alive, the kafirun (the rejecters of faith) have hearts that are dead, and 
	the munafiqun (the hypocrites) have hearts that are diseased. The two 
	general types of heart that are described are the extensively described 
	spiritual heart and the physical heart</i></font></p>

	Editor-in-Chief<br>
	The International Journal of Cardiology </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Dear Sir, Greetings </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I hold a PhD degree in 
	Psychometrics/Statistics and work at a major university in the US. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The “subject” heading of my email is a 
	title for an article that your journal is publishing. I had just started 
	writing a submission to respond to this fallacious article that your journal 
	published. This article will give credibility to voodo science and lies a la 
	Qur’anic style. I stopped writing my article because other researchers did 
	enough on the aforementioned article to show how erroneous that article is (Syed 
	Kamran Mirza and M. A. Khan did enough, not to mention Abul Kasem). I would 
	like to draw your attention that those authors are researchers on Islam for 
	many many years. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I am writing to you for two reasons:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">1. For the sake of scientific and academic 
	integrity, if your Journal is going to keep that fallacious article in the 
	Journal, then it is a moral imperative that you publish the responses to 
	this article that you received from Abul Kasem, Dr. Syed kamran Mirza, and 
	M. A. Khan. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">2. I have published many articles. Some in 
	refereed Journals. Two of them are in top tier Journals. The usual process 
	is that you do the research and write the article and submit it. The article 
	is then sent by the journal to three or more reviewers. In about 3 to 6 
	months, the Journal hears from the reviewers and their comments. The 
	comments and requests of changes are sent to the researcher(s) to fix 
	his/her article. This process takes another 3 to 6 months (and may be 
	repeated for a second round if needed). The article is sent to the reviewers 
	again to make sure that the authors have satisfied their requirements. 
	Finally, the article is accepted for publication (in 6 to 12 months as a 
	minimum) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Now, my question is this: How in the world 
	you receive an article and get it accepted in five days? Can you see what is 
	wrong here. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">In any case, you are free to do with your 
	journal as you please. The moral obligation on your Journal is either to 
	withdraw that “voodo” article from your accepted articles. Or publish it 
	along with the responses from Abul Kasem, Mirza, and Khan. In this manner, 
	the article is discredited right away. My own view is that if you want to 
	keep your journal at a scientifically reputed level, take out that 
	fallacious article and never look back. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Dear Sir, </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Though late, I am 
	horrified to see the article entitled “The heart and cardiovascular system 
	in the Qur’an and Hadith” by a group of authors- Marios Loukas et al on line 
	published in your journal recently. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I am a medical physicist 
	by profession now engaged in teaching and research in the department of 
	medical physics and biomedical engineering in a private university in Dhaka, 
	Bangladesh. My first reaction is this: it is neither a research article nor 
	a good review article on the subject. The authors have willfully tried to 
	mislead the readers using a catchy title with the intention of preaching the 
	greatness of the holy book even as a book of biological science dealing with 
	human system to impress upon the western readers having little or no 
	knowledge of Islam in general and on Qur’an in particular. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">I have studied important 
	holy books of all major religions including the Qur’an since my boyhood when 
	I was exposed to Qur’anic study at class eight in our Arabic class and 
	continued for 2-years. I still read, whenever I need, the holy Qur’an and 
	other religious scriptures as I find them quite interesting from the 
	sociological point of view. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Let me clearly state, Mr. 
	Editor, that I have no prejudice against Islam or for that matter against 
	any other religion(s) including animism. Any individual has the basic right 
	to hold and practice any religion of his likings, but that does not mean 
	those people have the right to intermingle their religion with science as we 
	understand today. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>What is Qur’an? </b>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">The Qur’an, as I 
	understand is devoutly a religious book prescribing as if it is a complete 
	code of life for its followers. The author of the holy book never meant or 
	attempted to show that it were a book on science or of other specialized 
	discipline like history, economics, geography, anthropology etc. The Qur’an 
	was meant, and still is meant for common mass with average intelligence to 
	follow it so that they can achieve the jannat after the worldly life. That 
	is why it covers, like many other religious books, many aspects of day to 
	day life including the creation of the universe and the earth, rudimentary 
	information on health and hygiene, birth of children, marriage, and 
	inheritance etc. on the basis of the knowledge available to the Qur’anic 
	authors at that time. The Qur’an is full of ‘Dos and not Dos’ for its 
	followers and boring repetition of things again again including the stories 
	of Musa, Jesus, Ibrahim, Daud and Solomon and Pharaohs of Egypt etc. It 
	treats those don’t have faith in Qur’an as kafirs (non believers) and 
	prescribed for them severe punishment afterworld. The Qur’an shows very poor 
	knowledge of world history and geography- its limit is within Semitic Asia. 
	The greatness of Egyptian, Chinese, Greek and Indian civilization is poorly 
	reflected, although its followers in the later period (9th-11th century AD), 
	especially the intelligentsia of the Arab world profusely used the store 
	house of knowledge of these countries to create new world of knowledge in 
	the Islamic world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Garamond" size="4">Although I would not call 
	the article as ‘voodoo science’, nor even a ‘pseudo science’, but surely not 
	call it a research scientific paper by modern standard set out by scientific 
	journal. In a scientific journal, neither place of miracle nor words of God 
	or goddesses find place as authoritative source or reference. This reminds 
	me a story about .... ( <b>Read the complete letter of Prof Ajoy Roy</b>
