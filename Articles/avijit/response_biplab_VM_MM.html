<p><b>Response: </b>Biplab, some of your statements are factually incorrect. 
First of all, I did not write any article &quot;criticizing Americans brutally&quot;.&nbsp; 
If you are aware the chronological advancement you must have noticed that I 
initially wrote a Bangla article named &quot;Olosh Dinner Bhabna&quot; which was mainly on 
the review of my book &quot;Alo Hate choliyache Adharer Jaatree&quot;. Major part of the&nbsp; 
article focused on Rabindranth and his conception on science and his small 
involvement in writing popular science etc. In my other part of writing,&nbsp; 
based on Dr. Shahidul Islam's work I made some socio-political analysis of 
current events. My article was selected for Bangla newspapers lately. I do not 
know why Quddus Khan, the editor of Vinnomot&nbsp; jumped over me (this is not 
the first time though) with an article with an irritating Title - &quot;Jatishongher 
Aloke MuktoMona bondhutir koshto&quot;, where he used equally provocative and 
irritating adjectives such as &quot;adha communist&quot;, &quot;bhong-dhora manobota baadi&quot;, &quot;mukto-mona 
theke memebr ra chole jawyay monokhunno&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;Singapore e Doctorate kora ba 
korchey emon..&quot; bla bla.. Knowing the nature, I did not even bother to respond 
any of his articles lately. I know some of MM members have responded though. For 
example Ananta from Sylhet wrote a very strong rebuttal, later on Nondini and 
Ms. Shetara Hashem wrote&nbsp; on the same topic. All the writers expressed 
their personal opinion here, just as you did.&nbsp; Even though I kept myself 
away from this debate,&nbsp; I found in his second response (to Ananta) Quddus 
Khan irrelevantly brought my name once again. Nevertheless, I did not bother to 
respond. Still then - very interestingly, today I found another &quot;author&quot; in 
vinnomot named &quot;Dhakaiya&quot; accusing me for personal attack in response to Khan. I 
am not sure, how I could do the &quot;personal attack&quot; while I carefully took myself 
away from any kind of debate/mud-slinging? </p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to make the record straight, that's why I wrote this, 
though I know there will be always some Dhakaiyas to make the water muddy. We 
have to live with this. </p>
<p>=================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Ms Hashem, I am travelling and therefore do not have much time for 
reply. Once I find time I will write in Bengali. </p>
<p>Firstly, I have not attacked you personally and still you are attacking me 
personally. Isn't true in all time of the history and society that younger 
people learn from the older? </p>
<p>I willl not reply to personal attack except one which I need to clarify </p>
<p>[1] Both Kuddus and Avijit have been doing a great job for Bengali community. 
What Kuddus is writing , is not illogical. It is mostly the common feelings 
among common Americans which you will never learn unless you have all American 
collegues like me! Their ideas might be strange and parochial but it is their 
feeling because they have not been born and brought up like Americans! </p>
<p>Kuddus didn't make mistake in logic but in presentation. If he would have 
said that he was also shocked to find out the way Americans think, all problems 
would have been solved. Instead, he commented Avijit can not underderstand 
American mentality! Truely even I was shocked to find the way American thinks 
after I find them in US soil! Kuddus needs to keep his emotion in control! </p>
<p>[2] Avijit criticized American brutality. Rightfully we all must do that. But 
then he was frustrated that Vinnomot is not taking a note of it. And out of 
frustration, he forced the issue that America should be equated with Islamic 
terrorist. Which is unacceptable because US believe in democracy (except for 
countercommunism, making profits etc..) and Islamists do not (under any 
condition). </p>
<p>Even Stalins had to shake the hand with USA in 2nd world war to stop 
Nazis-Nazis are like Islamists who do not care for other's opinian and thought.
</p>
<p>I saw a beutiful writing in Fresno farm today--Fruit grows where water flows. 
Fruits are like thoughts where as water is like freedom. Without freedom our 
thoughts will die. </p>
<p>Stalins and Mao might be ruthless,but they knew socialism unlike you. </p>
<p>From dialectic standpoint Nazis/Islamism is feudalism where as US bears 
capitalism. When socialists are forced with a choice between two, the are 
supposed to choose Capitalism over feudalism. That's whay Mao and Stalin fought 
hand in hand with USA to stop feudalist Nazis and Japanease. Because Socialism 
can only be realized after full development of capitals--capitals are still 
being developed. </p>
<p>Who knows socialism better Ms Hashem..Mao or you? Stalin or you? </p>
<p>[3] During 1927-1933, communists and liberals fought with each others in 
Germany instead of being united against Hitler. As a result Hitler came in power 
even with 24% supports and eliminated both. </p>
<p>Situation is same in Bangladesh. Islamists had only 14% support. But 
opposition to them are not united and therefore, they will come to power. Then 
they will eliminate both Avi and Kuddus like liberals. </p>
<p>[4] Liberals like me, Kuddus, Avijit have a problem. We think if our logics 
are defeated we are defeated. We have existence as human being and as a group. 
We are placing our own ego before our group's interest. This is why in Marxism, 
or in Marxist strategy, they always emphasize that you or your friends or your 
ideals are not greater than the ineterest of the group. </p>
<p>If we can not win over small triffle ego, sacrifice our pleasure of wining 
before the interest of common people, what is the use of being vinnomot or 
mukto-mona? </p>
<p>Anyhow, do not fuel division. </p>
<p>[5] Now to my personal attack: I am developing instruments for better quality 
of medicine and water. Yes to bring more capitals. And to serve the society. 
That's why Capitalism is great to bring laboratoiry research to common people. 
Had I have been doing this in India or Russia, it would have been in the 
laboratoty. </p>
<p>I understand capitals more than what Marx wrote in Das Capital. Because Marx 
never created any capital and neve been in the loop! -Thanks Biplab</p>
