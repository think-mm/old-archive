&gt; Dear members,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Assalamu Alaikum.I am sending this item on Answering Atheists Concerning God 
from islamonline.net.I do not know how far it will be useful. Still it is better 
for believers to know these points.These may also help those with open mind 
among atheists to re-think. <br>
<br>
<br>
Response: Walaikum Salam! Atheist like me are always open-minded. if you can 
provide evidences on behalf of existance of so-called God or whatever. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; Name of Counsellor Nabil Haroun <br>
&gt; Answer <br>
&gt; Salam, Muhammad.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thank you very much for your question.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Let us first differentiate between theories and scientific facts. While the 
former are based on human assumptions (and often prejudices), the latter should 
be based on tangible evidence and rational proofs.<br>
<br>
Response: The theory in part constructs the reality. Reality exists independent 
of the observer, of course, but our perceptions of reality are influenced by the 
theories framing our examination of it. Thus, philosophers call science theory 
laden. Generally speaking, Scientific theories are to be testifiable and 
falsifiable. If the theory contradicts with any scientific fact, the theory 
becomes void. Kindly let me know whether the assumption of god is testifiable or 
falsifiable in this regard. How such assumption of God is any better than 
believing in unicorn or fairies, is beyond my understanding. I am sure you will 
not proclaim that believing in Unicorn is also scientific. Again, burden of 
proof resides to the shoulder of the proponent who believes in something, not to 
his opponents.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Modern science has brought an end to the atheist dogma that influenced the 
minds, souls, and societies in the 19th and most of the 20th centuries. Many 
assumptive theories were falsely cloaked in the robes of science, and brought 
forward to replace the sound faith in God with atheist dogmas.<br>
&gt; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response: Really? From where you got the idea that science had brought to an 
end of &quot;atheist dogma&quot;? Surveys, however, do not confirm your claim. A recent 
poll of&nbsp; renowned world scientists [U.S. National Academy of Science 
members] indicated only 7% believe in a personal creator, down from 15% in 1933 
and 29% in 1914. If anything, most scientists seem to be moving towards 
so-called &quot;atheist dogma&quot; rather than moving away from it.</p>
<p>BTW, science itself does not preach atheism or theism. The purpose of science 
is not to &quot;find God&quot; or &quot;disprove&quot; it. In plain word, the purpose of science is 
to solve or explain any unsolved mystery, without bringing the supernatural 
terms.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Yet such dogmas as Darwinism, Marxism, and Freudianism - among others - have 
all collapsed and faded away, when subjected to the true test of scientific 
evidence and reasoning. The weakness of these atheist theories lies in their 
being based on the atheist precepts and inclinations of their founders, rather 
on any true evidence.<br>
&gt; <br>
Response: I think Dr. Jaffor Ullah has already covered the part with a great 
detail. I do not need to repeat it. The origin of new species proposed by Darwin 
thru natural selection&nbsp; has been observed, both in the laboratory and in 
the nature. See, for example, (Weinberg, J.R., V.R. Starczak, and D. Jorg, 1992, 
&quot;Evidence for rapid speciation following a founder event in the laboratory.&quot; 
Evolution 46: 1214-1220). Equating evolution with Marxism and calling the theory 
a dogma shows author's dogmatic mindset. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Extra confidence in one's own assumptions have led the founders of such 
theories to ignore a basic axiom of real science: to build conclusions on 
tangible proofs, not on assumptions and conjectures.<br>
&gt; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response: So, your own assumption on existence of god has&nbsp; &quot;tangible 
proofs&quot;, I presume!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In fact, human perception and physical knowledge are limited, due to the 
narrow range of our senses. The scope of the unseen, the unheard, the unsmelled, 
and the unfelt is much more wider than what our senses allow. Besides, the 
capacity of human intellect is limited to the ability to observe, analyze, 
correlate, and understand the relations and laws governing the physical, 
chemical, and biological phenomena.<br>
&gt; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Yet human perception is totally unfit to answer the big question: WHY any 
component or system of this world, or our own body or soul, acts or behaves the 
way it does. Any human can never change, influence, or force anything in nature 
to act differently or to deviate from its predestined course.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Nonetheless, it is crucial to pay attention to what a reasonable and honest 
reading of the physical world tells us about God. Read through the &quot;book of 
nature&quot; at any level - from the smallest subatomic particles to the single 
living cells, to the complex biological systems of plant, animal, or human life. 
You may also observe the universe at large: from our planet earth, to the solar 
and the galactic systems! God is always there, everywhere: the Creator and 
Fashioner God, Who is Ever-Knowing and Wise, and is Ever-Living and Sustainer.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; He is manifest everywhere through His unique capacity to:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1.. Initiate: to create matter from nothingness <br>
&gt; 2.. Determine: to determine such unlimited diversity of matter, species, and 
systems <br>
&gt; 3.. Design: to let each of His creations have its own features and to follow 
exactly His predestined laws <br>
&gt; 4.. Harmonize: to operate all systems - physical, chemical, and biological - 
and balance them in a harmoniously integrated fashion <br>
&gt; 5.. Sustain: to maintain, all the time, all matter existing and functioning in 
the same predesigned way <br>
&gt; Now, back to your question; how to prove these manifest attributes? In fact, a 
negative answer to each of the following queries would give the proof!<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; You can follow these arguments:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; a.. Initiation: Could one argue with the ability of God alone to initiate 
every bit of matter? Or could matter create itself from nothing, or come to 
existence by an infinitesimally probable chance? <br>
&gt; b.. Determination: Could chance alone produce such overwhelming diversity of 
chemical structures, biological species, and humankind? Could the diversity of 
the chemical elements in the periodic table, composed of the same subatomic 
particles, be the result of electrons, protons, and neutrons deciding for 
themselves to arrange these ways? From these elements, could the vast chemical 
and biochemical ones emerge by chaotic hits of chance? <br>
&gt; c.. Design: Could one believe that each and every of the multitude of life 
systems would decide to function the unique and complex fashions they do, 
fashions that are much more complex and more precise than huge modern chemical 
plants? Could the unique genetic &quot;software&quot; implanted in each living cell be 
self-invented by the components of their DNAs? <br>
&gt; d.. Harmony: Could the overall ecological balance between the biota, 
atmosphere, earth, and sea - which maintains biological diversity and 
environmental sustainability - be the product of nature's global &quot;self-accord&quot;?
<br>
&gt; e.. Sustenance: Could physical matter, at any level of complexity, deviate 
from the laws governing and maintaining its existence, properties, and behavior?
<br>
&gt; As the rational answer to each of these five questions is a definite NO, then 
the inevitable clear truth emerges: This universe could only be the creation of 
One Initiator God, by His determination, according to His super design, such as 
to follow His laws, and to collectively function in harmony according to a 
single sustained pattern, with no single deviation or disparity.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; This same rationale that tells about the One Ever-Living Creator, Who is 
Ever-Sustainer and Hegemonic over all creation, similarly refutes those baseless 
illusions regarding polytheistic gods, whether they were imagined by primitive 
man or invented by philosophers, all alike.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Throughout history, polytheism took several forms: from the primitive idol 
gods of ancient Egypt and Greece, to the present Christian and Hindu trinities, 
which are regarded as polytheism by Islam. They all fell into the same problem. 
In other words, the transcendental nature of the Divine in Islam does not accept 
any other nature of this Divine. Monotheism in Islam means the One and Only God. 
He is not only one in number, but also in nature. And it is against His 
monotheistic entity to have Him reflected through different or variable natures, 
as takes place with other religions.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; In his renowned 2001 book, The Hidden Face of God - How Science Reveals the 
Ultimate Truth, Gerald Schroeder admits that &quot;a single consciousness, a 
universal wisdom, pervades the universe. . All existence is the experience of 
this wisdom.&quot; He adds that &quot;every particle, every being, from atom to human, 
appears to represent a level of information, of wisdom.&quot; To find an answer to 
the puzzle from where this information arises, Schroeder concludes that &quot;wisdom, 
information, and an idea, is the link between the metaphysical creating force 
and the physical creation. It is the 'hidden' face of God.&quot;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; It took the atheists 14 centuries to rediscover (not discover) these basic 
facts - facts that the Qur'an, the eternal word of God, has so repeatedly 
declared and manifestly expounded. Please go back to the Noble Qur'an and read 
it. You will find endless verses explaining and emphasizing what was mentioned 
above.<br>
&gt; <br>

&gt; I hope this answer satisfies you. If you have any other queries, please don't 
hesitate to write to us again. Thank you and keep in touch.<br>
