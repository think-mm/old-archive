<p>While I appreciate Raman Shah's very informative concise response, I however 
request him to consider following points as well :</p>
<p>[1] Initially Ho Chi Minh had written numerous letters to President Trumen 
and state department asking for US help in wining Vietnamese independence from 
French and finding peaceful solution of the country. All his entreaties were 
ignored. </p>
<p>[2] Ho chi Minh modeled the new Vietnamese declaration of independence 
similar to American constitution. like &quot;in god we trust&quot;, their declaration also 
mentioned -&quot;All men are created equal. They are endowed by the creator with...&quot; 
But To US those words count nothing, as Ho Chi Minh was some kind of &quot;communist&quot; 
( this is enough bad-for-you label warning)</p>
<p>[3] US forced not only killed million of people there, but also poisoned the 
earth, the water and the gene pools for generations.</p>
<p>[4] US promised for postwar contribution of 3.25 billion of grant aid 
(President Nixon sent a message to PM of north Vietnam), however nothing of the 
promised reconstruction aid was ever paid. Not a single penny.</p>
<p>[5] Surprisingly, it is Vietnam has been compensating US. In 1997 it began to 
pay off about $145 million in debts left by the defeated south Vietnamese govt 
for American food and infrastructure aid. Thus Hanoi is reimbursing the US for 
part of the cost of the war waged against it.</p>
<p>[6] The First secretary of Press Affairs, Mr. Le Dzung, at Vietnamese embassy 
in Washington clearly showed anger and frustration for Nixon's&nbsp; unpaid 
billions. </p>
<p>[6] For Laos pls consider how CIA agents stuffed ballot boxes to help&nbsp; a 
hand picked strongman, Phoumi Nosavan to set up a pro US govt. Also consider the 
numerous incidents of bombing between 1964-73. </p>
<p>[7] In case of Cambodia various assassination plots have been made to remove 
Prince Shihanouk. Also consider Nixon/Kissinger's secret carpet bombing in 
1969-70. The years of US bombing had caused Cambodia's traditional economy to 
vanish. </p>
<p>[8] Us supported Polpot who is considered &quot;worst then Hitler&quot; and responsible 
for killing about 2 million Cambodians. Hypocrisy is, &quot;anticommunist&quot; US here 
supporting the Maoist, the terrible Khemar Rouge. </p>
