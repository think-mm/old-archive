<p>Mr. Gibbons:</p>
<p>I am afraid that your thinking is so jumbled and confused it is really hard 
to know from where to start. At least you have to be a bit more sophisticated, 
otherwise you argue on the basis of things I find to be of little value. I will 
say that the following you wrote indicates something: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>Firstly, If there truly is a Creator or Supreme Being Who created 
	everything out a a sheer act of creative will, what does it matter if the 
	order of each act of creation does not conform to our finite human 
	understanding? </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clearly indicates your contempt for the reasoning faculties we have. 
After all in the end our ability to ask questions and to seek answers is about 
all we really have. I think that arguing with you is totally useless as I found 
your mind is clearly ossified into a strict Biblically literalist form. </p>
<p>I suspect that when folks that have little or no knowledge of paleontology 
listen to&nbsp; you that they are impressed with his apparent knowledge. Perhaps 
you know the terms and is familiar with the names of various organisms. But most 
of your logic is both mistaken and bizarre. You mention the problem of a mammal 
eating a dinosaur, not seeming to realize that mammals and dinosaurs first 
appear in the fossil record in the Carnian of the Upper Triassic - about 220 mya. 
Being surprised at a mammal eating a dinsosaur egg during the Cretaceous should 
not be particularly strange. You also wants to linearize the evolutionary 
record, rather than seeing it more as a bush. You think that organisms like 
sharks -- who evolved during the late Devonian -- shouldn't still be here if 
evolution were true. Where does he get these ideas? You read Dawkins and Miller 
apparently - but did not get the point. Everything is colored by his need to 
have the Bible as literally true.</p>
<p>Here I will try to give a response to you till I get tired. I will do the 
rest when I will find free time again.</p>
<p>You said : <i>&quot;I thought we were going to discuss science. But you have 
decided to focus on the creation account of Genesis. Why? Is it perhaps easier 
for you to ridicule the Holy Bible, rather than defend Darwinism?&quot;</i></p>
<p>Response : No Not at all. You mentioned some Christian organization's name 
whom you think are providing alternative solution proposed. If you would not 
have done so, it would not be needed. </p>
<p>You said : <i>&quot;So, Bible believing Christians and orthodox Jews are not 
INTELLIGENT? Of course, you have made a life long study of Judaism and 
Christianity before arriving at this conclusion? You didn't mention Islam. Is 
that perhaps because you are a member of that particular religion?&quot;</i></p>
<p>Response: Wrong assumption. I am not Muslim. Just because I did not mention 
anything about Quran (the reason i stated above already) you assumed that I 
belong to a particular (Islamic) faith. It's just &quot;black and white&quot; fallacy (Falacy 
of Bifurcation) and &quot;false dichotomy&quot; bifurcation; it occurs if someone presents 
a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives 
exist or can exist.&nbsp; [For example i can be a Buddist, Hindu, Atheist, 
deist..etc... that you did not consider].</p>
<p>You said : <i>&quot;Islam teaches that there is also a Creator (Allah). Most 
Muslims reject evolution and a naturalistic beginning to the creation of the 
universe. Indeed, in the Middle Ages Muslim countries were at the forefront of 
scientific and medical advances, but they didn't need to fall back on naturalism 
to make that kind of progress. Your rejection of the the Bible and the Torah but 
not the Koran is intriguing.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Response: Your lecture has been delivered in a wrong place. I am no Muslim, 
so entire paragraph is just irrelevant for me. Again, here you committed a 
fallacy named Circulus in demonstrando as you assume as a premise the conclusion 
which you wish to reach. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;You said : <i>&quot;Which area of &quot;science&quot; are you referring to? Not the 
jumbled fossil record I hope, or the fictitious geologic column where only five 
of the ten alleged 'geologic ages' are are known to exist anywhere in the world. 
The fossil record shows reveals a number of surprises that contradict the &quot;true 
order&quot; that you claim. See more on this below in answer to your fifth point.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Response: So fossil record is &quot;mumbled jumbled&quot; for you? Are you 
really gonna make me believe 
that earth was created first and then God created rest of the stuffs in 
universe? We do not need to check the fossil record for this. In fact, the 
creation story in Genesis, (not the fossil record) is mumbo-jumbo —no matter how 
you spin it. In the Bible, the universe is a firmament and Earth is fixed and 
immovable (not to mention flat). In reality, the universe is expanding and Earth 
rotates about the sun. In the Bible, Earth is created in the first “day,” before 
the sun, moon, and stars. In reality, Earth did not form until nine billion 
years after the Big Bang and after the sun and many other stars. </p>
<p>You said, &quot;Firstly, If there truly is a Creator or Supreme Being Who created 
everything out a a sheer act of creative will, what does it matter if the order 
of each act of creation does not conform to our finite human understanding?&quot;</p>
<p>I replied it before.&nbsp; After hearing such sermon, whole purpose of debate 
becomes meaning less. If you think God can do everything out a a sheer act of 
creative will, then why not evolution? He can perform the evolution too. Why we 
are debating for then? Here are the responses I got on some of your valid 
points:</p>
