Correct interpretation of secularism? Am I hearing the declaration of a Fatwa, 
or a Vatican Bull? Measured by whose standards? I thought any rationalist is 
supposed to maintain a degree of scepticism before pronouncing occludent 
judgment on what is CORRECT or incorrect.<br>
<br>
How is this gesture any different than a Bible-thumping, fatwa-spewing, trishul-waving 
fundamentalist? &quot;My view (my God, or my denial of God) is right -- all others 
are heathens, kaffirs, Hindu fanatics, dirty Muslim terrorists, zombies, idiots, 
brain-deads, etc. !&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
[Response:] Actually I did not claim my view is right. I claimed your view 
‘equal respect to all religions and cultures’ is no secularism, as per 
definition. I provided dictionary meaning as well as sufficient references of 
scholars. But instead of refuting the arguments, an attack against the character 
of person such as &quot;he is no expert&quot;, &quot;Vatican Bull&quot;, or attack thru 
&quot;Bible-thumping, fatwa-spewing, trishul-waving fundamentalist&quot; is made. Ms Majid 
thought this attack is to be taken to be evidence against the claim or argument 
the person in question is making (or presenting). Ms. Majid's &quot;rebuttal&quot; has the 
following form: <br>
<br>
<br>
Person A makes claim X. <br>
Person B makes an attack on person A. <br>
Therefore A's claim is false. <br>
<br>
<br>
So Ms. Majid thinks she is right.<br>

Evidently, The subject of secularism is not this author's subject of expertise. 
He does not know where to begin -- or where to end, for that matter.<br>
<br>
[Response] <br>
Such &quot;shcholarly&quot; statement does not deserve any rebuttal. I would be greatful 
to know how Ms. Majid considers herself as &quot;shcholar&quot; and &quot;expert&quot; in the 
&quot;subject of secularism&quot;, whreas her oponents are not? Forget about me, I used 
quote of Prof. Jayanti Patel who is specialized in collective social violence 
studies and politics. Here is the exact quote of Jayanti Patel on Secularism :<br>
<br>
&quot;Our interpretation of secular as SARVADHARMA-SAMABHAV, protecting every 
religion and their diverse mode of belief structure, their separate social and 
civil code, varied customs, mores and faiths, and even education system is not 
conducive in building an integrated national society or human identity. Our 
identity is basically communal and has proved to be an obstruction in building a 
nation- state. It is clear that in interpreting the meaning of the word secular 
we have disregarded the spirit of the enlightenment and renaissance which was 
instrumental in building a modern state and the civic society in the west. It 
seems that we have to interpret the correct meaning of the word secular in our 
law enforcement. The connotation of the word secular should mean negation of all 
religions (SARVADHARMA-ABHAV).&quot; <br>
<br>
I will be glad to know how Ms. Majid is more &quot;expert&quot; compared to Prof. Patel 
and what is the criterion to become &quot;expert&quot; in the &quot;subject of secularism&quot;. Any 
special degree? <br>

Of what practical use is this view of &quot;secularism,&quot; defined as the denouncement 
of all religion? How exactly is this, the &quot;correct&quot; version of secularism, help 
us fight communalism, fundamentalism, rabid and covert misogyny, and casteism 
(the deshi form of racism)? How is it compatible with the democratic principle 
of &quot;freedom of religion&quot; which every form of secularism must absolutely mean if 
it is to be the basis of a democracy?<br>
<br>
[Response] <br>
Read my article without being hyperactive :). I did not put any hinder in taking 
demoratic principle of &quot;freedom of religion&quot; by the collective mass or in 
personal level, what I claimed that a 'secular state' means denial of 
involvement in religious activities from the state and govt. That means, 
religion should be essentially distinct from Government and state activites. The 
dictionary definition of secularism is: it is a concept which postulates that 
policies, such as state, education etc should be free from religious 
injunctions. I did not say anything about what mass population or one Farida 
majid or one Munir Islam will do with religion. He or she has every right to 
choose a religion or reject it. Is it very hard to understand? Prove me if I 
quoted anything wrongly instead to putting yourself as a &quot;victim&quot;!<br>

Please spare us from this form of schoolyard squabble, please. <br>
<br>
<br>
[Response] <br>
Ha ha:). I understand your frustration :) Again Attack --&quot;form of schoolyard 
squabble&quot; ? You thought you got enough points by saying so? Well, mere fact is, 
delivering such abusive words has nothing to do with the truth or falsity of the 
proposition being defended. <br>
