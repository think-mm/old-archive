	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">
	Science and religion, no doubt are two great manifestations of human 
	culture. To what degree are they complementary and to what degree are they 
	in opposition? &nbsp;Recently, Mohammad Gani from Cambridge, Massachusetts has 
	written series of articles claiming that religion and science are 
	cooperating to explore the nature of reality. This article is written as a 
	reply to Mr. Gani’s last article published in Mukto-Mona on Jun 3, 2008.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">I 
	should start thanking Mr. Gani
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/48545">
	for his response</a> to my previous response of the same thread to continue 
	our ongoing dialogue on science and religion. I have read his ‘last 
	response’ carefully. I thought his initial article was targeted to show us 
	the reality – interrelationship between science and religion – without being 
	emotional. Hence, he named his article ‘Science and Religion: Reality vs. 
	Emotion!’&nbsp; But after reading his last response, I could not decipher much 
	other than his emotional verbiages. He cut some amusing jokes with a punch 
	line (chair table, student, teacher or bear God etc.) which might have some 
	literary value; but I am afraid to say that none of these jokes posses any 
	scientific merit at all. On a lighter part, a joke can be taken for laughter 
	or amusement but it does not provide any conclusion on the debate on such 
	serious matter.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Now 
	let’s go straight to the point. My initial attempt was to refute Mr. Gani’s 
	claim who tried to mix science with supernatural. He cited a verse from 
	Quran and found resemblance with Big bang. &nbsp;I have shown in my response that 
	it was a flawed attempt. Any vague phrase or metaphor can be customized and 
	made to fit any scientific principle when the scientific invention is made. 
	By claiming these scientific principles were already contained in the 
	ancient holy books are a way of ignoring the painstaking research that has 
	helped us to formulate the reality of worldview. Any Ram, Shyam Jadu Madhu 
	might have vaguely said “Everything is relative” before Einstein came into 
	the picture; but to relate such comment of Jadu Madu with Einstein’s later 
	invention and take away all the credit from the reputed scientist is not 
	only mere extreme, but an attack and insult on reputed scientists’ ongoing 
	painstaking research. I hope Mr. Gani would understand the severity while he 
	would claim for “scientific miracles” in the particular ancient holy book(s). 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly Mr. Gani tried to put forward “God in Gaps” argument as an 
	evidence of God’s existence in our discussion. For instance, Mr. Gani could 
	not see how the universe (or matter) came about naturally, so he thought it 
	must have come about supernaturally. He could not see how the universe 
	became orderly by natural processes, so he assumed that order must have come 
	about by supernatural processes. He could not see how physical laws could 
	originate naturally, so it must be God’s creation.&nbsp;&nbsp; He could not see how 
	objective morality came from humanity, so it must have come from God. In 
	each of these cases I have given plausible natural explanation(s) from 
	science that violates no known principles of science and requires no divine 
	actions. Mr. Gani could not succeed in proving these natural explanations 
	wrong, and so could not succeed in proving that we need God or any sort of 
	supernatural explanation for these. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Now 
	the question is, why rely on natural explanation? It is because, Naturalism 
	is a better explanation than supernaturalism, and it has been proven 
	repeatedly in the past. In many cases, such as the mystery of rain fall or 
	motion of earth etc which ancient people could not solve and invoked 
	supernatural intervention for events unnecessarily, Natural explanations 
	through water cycle or laws of Gravity etc provided simpler but sound 
	explanations later which are based on objective observations, and are fully 
	consistent with all we know about the world. In fact this is the basic 
	principle of science – we should seek natural explanation for the phenomena, 
	testing these phenomena by the rigorous methods of science. In fact, the 
	scientific naturalism does not count the non-evidential postulation of 
	occult metaphor or any sort of divine intervention – and to be frank, it 
	tries to deal with materialistic, physical –chemical or non-reductive 
	natural explanations. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">This 
	is why, origin of universe or origins of life - even though they are 
	supposed to be hard problems, the scientists rely on scientific naturalism 
	for obvious reasons. In fact we already have a sound theory of how universe 
	can be originated thru vacuum fluctuation and how life has evolved through 
	Darwinian evolution in earth. On the other hand, relying on supernatural or 
	‘God did it’ hypothesis does not add any extra value of knowledge in our 
	ongoing journey. &nbsp;‘God did it’ is just another way showing people the 
	intrinsic ignorance. &nbsp;In our schooldays we all used to provide answer of the 
	simple questions of physics in our exam – “Why the sky is blue?” or “How the 
	snowflakes are formed?” etc. I would like to ask Mr Gani - what grade or 
	mark a student will expect if he writes “God made the sky blue for us” or 
	“snowflakes are formed by the grace of Almighty” in his answer sheet?&nbsp; Zero! 
	The teacher will assume that the student does not know the answer and 
	expressing his ignorance in verbiage. So, invoking God to explain a 
	scientific phenomenon, no mater whether it is sky, snowflake or the 
	universe, is nothing but adding just another form of ignorance. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">There 
	are other problems as well in invoking “God” term in a rational and 
	scientific discussion. Before coming to the question whether God can be 
	proven or disproven by science, it is important to know whether the term God 
	can be defined in a consistent way i.e. that a clear definition without 
	having any logical contradiction. The fact is it cant be as all definitions 
	or all sort of attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, all-loving, 
	perfect etc. inevitably gets into circularity, mutual contradictions and all 
	sorts of fallacies. &nbsp;For example, it has not been escaped from the logicians 
	that omniscience and omnipotence are mutually incompatible.&nbsp; Keren Owens has 
	captured this witty little paradox in the following composition:</span></p>

	<span style="font-family:Verdana">Change His future mind?</span></i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">The 
	point is, if God is Omniscient, he must already know how he’s going to 
	intervene to change the course of history using his omnipotence. But that 
	means he can’t change his mind about his intervention, which means he’s not 
	omnipotent.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">In 
	fact, the attribute of ‘omnipotent’ can easily be nullified by raising the 
	following question:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:

	<span style="font-family:Verdana">Can God create such a heavy stone that He 
	himself cannot lift?</span></i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">If 
	the answer of the above question is YES, then it shows his impotency in 
	lifting the stone, which means He’s NOT all-powerful or Omnipotent. Again, 
	if the answer of the above question is No, that means he is not capable of 
	creating such stone, which again showing his incapability. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Now - 
	the famous ‘argument of evil’. In my previous response, I argued that humans 
	cannot be held responsible for a massive flood, earthquake, plague or 
	Tsunami. In fact, we can explain such calamities only by concluding that God 
	is malevolent, because he knew of terrible destructive events to occur. It 
	suggests that God is impotent to prevent evil. In fact, authoritative 
	‘Oxford companion to Philosophy’ admitted that the problem of evil as the 
	most powerful objection to the traditional theism, which no one could 
	counter comprehensively. To be precise, the existence of evil solely capable 
	to nullify the claim of omnipotence, benevolence and other attributes that 
	are popularly assigned to God.&nbsp; This has been shown by ancient Greek 
	philosopher Epicurus (341 BCE, Samos – 270 BCE, Athens) beautifully-&nbsp; </span>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt" align="justify"><i>
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">Is God willing to prevent evil, but not 
	able? Then he is not omnipotent.</span></i></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Our 
	Mukto-Mona member Aparthib also once discussed about the logical 
	inconsistencies between evil, free will and omniscience etc. in one of his 
	Bangla Articles (“Swadhin Iccha, Mondo O Iswarer Ostittyo”) which can be 
	accessed from the following link :</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">The 
	argument of evil also raises some other philosophical problems as well. In 
	his Book Shotter Shondhane (The Quest for truth) our peasant philosopher 
	Aroj Ali Matubbar asked whether anything happen without the permission of 
	God? If yes, his omnipotence will be in question; again If no, then what is 
	our fault when we commit sin?. This is what Matubbar exactly argued -</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt" align="justify"><i>
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">It is said that nothing happens without 
	the permission of Allah. Not even the leaf of a tree can tremble without his 
	consent. Indeed, if something can happen against His will or without His 
	consent His omnipotence will be called in question. But if everything 
	happens according to His will what is the fault or sin of the offender?</span></i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">In 
	the same book Matubbar also argued that God cannot be ‘just’ and ‘merciful’ 
	at the same time without having logical inconsistency. He said, </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-right:36.0pt;margin-bottom:
0pt;margin-left:36.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt" align="justify"><i>
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">“Other fields apart, it is impossible to 
	bring justice and mercy together in the field of trial in a law-court. In 
	order to show mercy to the offender, justice will have to be ignored and in 
	order to uphold justice, mercy will have to be sacrificed. It is said that 
	Allah is just and merciful. How is it possible? Is He just in one case and 
	merciful in another?”</span></i></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">While 
	the above discussion may seem to be juvenile for some, these issues have 
	serious philosophical implication. Science deals with well-defined concepts 
	about reality that is amenable to theoretical or observational study, 
	whereas the concept and definition of ‘God’ suffers from logical 
	absurdities. This can be a sole good argument for not to invoke God in any 
	scientific discussion. For the serious readers, I will argue to go through 
	the following article of Theodore M. Drange:</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">

		Incompatible-Properties Arguments</a> (originally published in Philo 
		1998 (2), pp. 49-60)&nbsp;</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">I 
	will also recommend physicist Prof Victor Stenger’s best selling book “God- 
	the failed hypothesis” where he showed that “3O”s – the primary attributes 
	of God staring with “O” (Omnibenevolence, Omnipotence and Omniscience) are 
	logically inconsistent.&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Mr 
	Gani is wondering whether science has disproved God. Well, I would say, 
	science does not need to do that. Science deals with well-defined concepts 
	about reality, not in a business of proving or disproving Zeus, Kali, 
	Unicorn, Medusa, Santa clause etc. In his book “Is there a God?” Bertrand 
	Russell argued that if someone suggest that between earth and Mars there is 
	a china teapot revolving, and nobody would be able to disprove that 
	assertion&nbsp; provided that teapot is too small to be revealed by our most 
	powerful telescopes and other cosmic devices.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">But 
	the fact is the obligations of disproving of an orbiting tea pot or tooth 
	fairy etc. are not felt by science. None of us feels an obligation to 
	disprove any of the million far-fetched things that a fertile or facetious 
	imagination can dream up.&nbsp; Who bears the “burden of proof” anyways? If Mr. 
	Gani believes that the God exists, it is he who has to bring the scientific 
	proof, cause, it is his duty to establish his concept or proposal, not my 
	duty to disprove it first. The burden of proof is always resides on the 
	person making an extraordinary assertion or proposition (for e.g existence 
	of god, angel, devil, alien etc.). It is obviously a fallacy to push the 
	burden of proof on the person who denies or questions such an assertion. On 
	a lighter note, while Mr. Gani considers Zeus, Apallo, Kali, Durga, Amon Ra, 
	Mithras, Thor or Flying-spaghetti-monster etc. are just myths, and not 
	needed to be disproved by science, I just go one more deity (i.e. his God) 
	further. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">Mr. 
	Gani in his article also argued that - </span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt" align="justify">
	<span style="font-family:Verdana">“Zero volume and infinite density mass (or 
	energy, you mentioned) concept: Indeed zero volume is dimensionless (say 
	&quot;nothing&quot; here) but infinite &quot;density&quot; is NOT dimensionless, thus physically 
	did exist before the Big Bang. You are obviously correct that &quot;mass/matter&quot; 
	came out from energy after Big Bang but the energy itself did not came out 
	from nothing, just violating law of science only ONCE 13 billions years ago; 
	energy has always been there all the way to the &quot;end&quot; or to the &quot;no end&quot; .”</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">To 
	refute this, I will cite the examples from the latest development of modern 
	physics. At least two solutions have been proposed. A solution proposed by 
	Alexander Vilenkin of Tufts University has the universe tunneling out the 
	chaos described above and thus &quot;coming from nothing.&quot; In 1982 he showed in 
	one of papers that this space which has a finite volume, can be decreased to 
	the volume of zero. In other wards, Vilenkin showed the concept of absolute 
	nothingness is at least mathematically defined (not matter how impossible to 
	imagine for us) and can be used as a starting point for the theories of 
	creation.&nbsp; The paper was titled, &quot;Creation of Universe from Nothing&quot; and was 
	published in reputed journal, Physics letters 117B&nbsp; (1982) 25-28. The paper 
	can be accessed from here:</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">
	&nbsp;There are other existing solutions (Hawking-Hartle proposal for instance) 
	as well without invoking such absolute nothingness. This solution proposed 
	by James Hartle and Stephen Hawking has no boundary conditions but describes 
	a universe existing before the chaos those tunnels through that chaos to 
	produce our universe. From our point of view that prior universe undergoes a 
	contraction and deflation that is the opposite of our inflation and 
	expansion. And also it is to be noted, many prominent physicists and 
	cosmologists have published papers in reputable scientific journals 
	proposing various scenarios by which the big bang appeared naturally out of 
	a preexisting universe that itself need not have had a beginning. Once such 
	recent scenario is called &quot;The Cyclic Universe&quot; (Steinhardt and Turok). If 
	this scenario sustains by the future observation, it will eventually prove 
	that universe may not have any beginning. &nbsp;</span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">But 
	let’s assume universe has a beginning. Mr. Gani argued that to begin, 
	universe did not come from zero sate of energy. I will ask him to read the 
	passage of Stephen Hawking&#39;s famous book &quot;The Brief History of Time&quot; (1988, 
	p 129) again that I provided him in my previous response –</span></p>

	<span style="font-family:Verdana">&nbsp;“There are something like ten million 
	million million million million million million million million million 
	million million million million (1 with eighty [five] zeroes after it) 
	particles in the region of the universe that we can observe. Where did they 
	all come from? The answer is that, in quantum theory, particles can be 
	created out of energy in the form of particle/antiparticle pairs. But that 
	just raises the question of where the energy came from. The answer is that 
	the total energy of the universe is exactly zero. <b>The matter in the 
	universe is made out of positive energy.</b> However, the matter is all 
	attracting itself by gravity. Two pieces of matter that are close to each 
	other have less energy than the same two pieces a long way apart, because 
	you have to expend energy to separate them against the gravitational force 
	that is pulling them together. Thus, in a sense, the gravitational field has 
	negative energy. In the case of a universe that is approximately uniform in 
	space, <b>one can</b> <b>show that this negative gravitational energy 
	exactly cancels the positive energy represented by the matter.</b> <b>So the 
	total energy of the universe is zero</b>”. </span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">In F. 
	I. Cooperstock’s “On the Total&nbsp; Energy of Open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker 
	Universes” paper which was published in Astrophysical Journal 587 (2003), pp 
	483-86 it has been shown that the total energy of the universe can be 
	defined for the most common type of cosmologies and the calculation is zero. 
	Prof. Victor Stenger also mentioned in his book “God- the failed hypothesis”

	<span style="font-family:Verdana">“The first law allows energy to convert 
	from one type to another as long as the total for a closed system remains 
	fixed. Remarkably, the sum of the rest kinetic energies of the bodies in the 
	early universe seems to have been exactly cancelled by the negative 
	potential energy that results from their mutual gravitational interactions. 
	Within small measurement errors and quantum uncertainties, the mean energy 
	density of the universe is exactly what it should be for <b><u>a universe

	Mr. Gani thinks the universe cannot be appeared from zero sate of energy he 
	is welcome to publish his claim in those reputed journals refuting Stephen

	so far. </span></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana">But 
	again, Mr. Gani would not accept these findings from famous physicists, 
	because God and religion probably provides some ‘emotional value’ for him. I 
	have, however no problem with it. But I only argue not to mix his emotions 
	with science.&nbsp; Science is based on plausible explanation commencing 
	scientific naturalism or foremost on scientific evidence, not authority or 
	revelation. In science, nothing is taken on faith, whereas in religion faith 
	is at the heart of belief. In science, all knowledge is tentative, 
	continually subject to revision, when better explanation based on evidence 
	are acquired; religion asserts the presence of unchanging and 
	unchallengeable eternal truths. Science proposes explanations about the 
	natural world and then puts those hypothesis for repeated testing using 
	experiments, observations and a creative and diverse array of other methods 
	and strategies. Many religions, on the other hand discourage skepticism or 
	critical examination of cherished precepts. This commitment to test the idea 
	and claims separates science from religion as a whole. </span></p>
