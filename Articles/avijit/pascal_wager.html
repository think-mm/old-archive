  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/19543">forwarded a letter</a> to my personal account yesterday stating the following 
  lines :
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">&quot;Recently, the writer of a famous Bengali 
  movie “Shabuz-Shathi” asked me a question, which as follows, “There is a 50% 
  chance that there exists a God. Is it not? Our propensity is to go for the 
  “good” when we are given a chance of 50%, and in every case we do go for the 
  “good”; but why in the case of God some of us go for the “bad”?” That was 
  basically the main question he asked me;...&quot;
  </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">The author of the above letter requested 
  me to respond to the topic from a rational point of view. Though, I remember 
  that I have already&nbsp;
  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/eshomabesh/message/2563">addressed the 
  issue about four years ago</a>&nbsp; while debating in other e-forum, and I 
  also remember, Aparthib shed some light on the same topic at that time in the 
  corresponding thread, still 
  such arguments demand&nbsp; &quot;Immediate attention&quot;&nbsp; time to time.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <div>
    <p align="justify"><strong style="font-weight: 400">The statement comes from 
    a believer mind is typically as follows----</strong></div>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><strong><font face="Arial" size="-1">Ok, there is a 
      50-50 chance for existence of God. If God does not exist then we will not 
      face any problem after death<b>. But if God exists you atheist people will go to 
      hell. So safe and most rational choice is believing, isn't it?</b></font></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Arguments generally 
    float in 
    myriad Bangladeshi-e-forums in above mentioned style is called &quot;Pascal's Wager&quot; 
    (or Pascal's Gambit). Blaise Pascal 
    (June 19, 1623 – August 19, 1662) was the seventeenth-century French 
    mathematician and physicist, who once formulated 
    this pragmatic argument in philosophy. Pascal, inspired by profound 
    religious belief,&nbsp; constructed the argument aiming especially at such 
    persons who were not convinced by traditional arguments for the existence of 
    God. This Pascal's wager having been 
    debunked centuries ago by the Skeptics and Rationalists, it, however still 
    serves good incentive among some faithful minds. &quot;Pascal's gamble&quot;, in a nutshell,&nbsp; 
    says that to believe in God is the best bet because if God exists, you'll go 
    to heaven and avoid hell. If you don't believe in God, you might lose all 
    this. If God does not exist, you'll have nothing to lose. So it's better to 
    believe in God than not to. In Pascal's word :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><strong><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;If you believe in 
      God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you 
      don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. 
      Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.&quot; </font></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The flaws in this argument 
    are legion - it is actually a rather poor piece of reasoning and not at all 
    appropriate for a thinker of Pascal's standing who is arguably considered as 
    the father of modern probability theory. </font></p>

    <span style="background-color: #99FFCC">Which religion is &quot;True Religion&quot;?</span></font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">The first problem lies in 
      defining &quot;True Religion&quot; and &quot;True God&quot; which Pascals' implicit yet 
      unstated assumption votes for Roman Catholicism. It is interesting to note 
      the fact that he used it as an argument for being a part of the Catholic 
      doctrine, but it is nevertheless used so often today by Protestants, 
      Islamists, Buddhists, Hindus-all, without recognizing the inherent fallacy 
      of the argument. <b>The argument itself does not explain which religion a 
      person should follow.</b> <b>This can be described as the &quot;avoiding the 
      wrong hell&quot; dilemma. If you happen to follow the right religion, you may 
      indeed &quot;...go to heaven and avoid hell.&quot; However, if you choose the wrong 
      religion, you will by no means be able to avoid hell.</b></font></p>
      <p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Un</i>fortunately, 
      most Believers are like Pascal and others simply assume that their own religion 
      is the right one, so it never occurs to them that they could be avoiding 
      the wrong hell.</font></b><font face="Arial" size="-1"> Pointing them from 
      this angle sometimes makes them stop and think, but it has been 
      experienced that they usually deny that the problem exists because they 
      firmly believe that the &quot;right God&quot; is &quot;obvious&quot; for all to see. It should 
      be clear from such statements that there are none as blind as those who 
      won't see. There are hundreds of religion&nbsp; in the market all 
      dogmatically claiming as the 
      true candidate of God; never mind what self-contradictory, unscientific strange 
      beliefs they hold. Many religions are offensive and totally antithetical 
      to each other. For example, Islam says that Christ was a man, but 
      Christianity says that he was a god. Christians generally believe in the 
      Trinity of God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy Spirit. But <b>if 
      Christianity is wrong, and Islam is correct, then it is expected that 
      Allah will punish all  Christian believers</b> with dreadful tortures. 
      He clearly specified it in the following Sura in Quran :</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><em><a name="003.085">003.085</a> </em><br>
        <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> If anyone desires a religion other than Islam 
        (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the 
        Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual 
        good).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">So if Allah is the true 
      god, all the Christians and the people of other faith except Islam will go 
      to hell&nbsp; not because of rejecting the God, but just for picking only 
      a wrong God. Again, Muslims believe in the single, indivisible deity 
      Allah, who is very different from the Christian concept of Holy Trinity.
      <b>If Islam is wrong, and Christianity turns out to be a correct religion, 
      then the Christian God will eventually torture all Muslims for eternity 
      without any hope of mercy</b>.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">According to Christian 
      belief, the person who rejects Jesus Christ not only dishonors the Son of 
      God, but he also dishonors God the Father; therefore, he does not receive 
      forgiveness of sin and he must stand before the Judge who is none other 
      than Jesus Christ, the One he rejected. Let me quote from Bible: </font>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><b>John 12:47-48</b> And if any man hear my words, and 
        believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to 
        save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath 
        one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge 
        him in the last day.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify">Now, <font face="Arial" size="-1">some religions like 
      Judo-Christianity and Islam are based on Monotheism; thus those thrust the 
      devoted followers believing in One God but Hindus, on the contrary, 
      believe in thousands of god and goddess. Muslims generally consider 
      idol-worship as a great sin (<i>shirak</i>) whereas Hindus perform that 
      ritual as a fundamental part of the religion They consider the idol is a 
      support for the neophyte. Muslims slaughter cows in 
      their religious festival whereas Hindus worship cows just as holy deities. 
      Hinduism, even having many self-contradictory bizarre beliefs within,&nbsp; 
      also proclaims that it is a true religion just as Islam or 
      Christianity demand:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><i>&quot;Sho-dhormo Nidhonong Sreyo, Poro dhormo Bhoyaboho&quot;
        </i></p>
        <p align="justify"><i>(It is better to die in own religion, other 
        religions are just&nbsp; horrendous)</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">So if, by any chance, 
      Hindu God is the true god, then all the Muslim brothers, with no offence,&nbsp; 
      will be pushed to hellfire on the judgment of the voluminous track records 
      of slaughtering cows in their religious festivals.&nbsp; Thus, it can be 
      easily comprehend that&nbsp; many devoted believers and god-loving people 
      will go to hell <b>not</b> because they are Atheists but because of their&nbsp; 
      unfortunate devotion in wrong God. This clearly depicts the vagueness of 
      Pascal's Wager. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">Aparthib refuted Pascal's 
      wager logically in his piece (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/eshomabesh/message/2587">eshomabesh 
      : message/2587</a> ) about four years ago: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">&quot;What does the construct &quot;us&quot; have 50-50 probability 
        of the &quot;fact&quot; that there might be life after death really mean? First of 
        all, for a believer the probability is a certainty, 100%. For the 
        non-believer it is 0%. For agnostics, mild believers it is anywhere from 
        0-100%. Whatever the percentage, these percentages indicate the various 
        levels of BELIEF among various humans in life after death, NOT THE 
        ACTUAL PROBABILITY OF LIFE AFTER DEATH, because the probability 
        [calculated as such] itself 
        is a faith, which cannot be objectively proven or calculated. So any 
        logic or argument that presupposes 50-50 (Or any other breakup) 
        probability of Life after death is a fallacious one, as arguments should 
        only be based on objective truths or evidences as premises.</p>
        <p align="justify">It assumes a 50-50 probability of life after death 
        (an invalid premise as I pointed out) and then advises one of the merit 
        of believing in it and the danger of not believing in it. It is amusing 
        that this Pascal's wager having been debunked centuries ago still 
        survives among some in the dawn of the third millennium. The other 
        aspect of the fallacy of Pascal's wager is that even if it turns out 
        that there is indeed life after death, it does not make religion-X true, 
        since there are other religions (Y,Z..etc) which also postulate life 
        after death. So using this &quot;logic&quot; to scare someone into one's favored 
        religion-X is nothing but a naive attempt to attract gullible souls 
        suffering from indecision.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">A believer does not wish 
      to fathom the inconsistency of the Pascal's argument as described above, 
      rather tends to believe blindly in &quot;uniqueness&quot; of his/her own&nbsp; dogma 
      just imperiously considering it as &quot;True&quot;. Pascal's wager thus 
      can be said to suffer from the logical fallacy of false dilemma/false 
      dichotomy/bifurcation, as it relies on only two alternatives: &quot;My own God&quot; 
      or &quot;No God&quot; scenario, where in fact other alternatives can exist. Both Pascal (whose implicit 
      belief was in Roman Catholicism) and a Muslim faithful (described in the 
      top), even following two self-contradictory and opposite ideologies, claim 
      to win the bet (i.e. achieve heaven and avoid hell) ignoring the 
      severe incongruities of&nbsp; the bet. </font></p>

      Theism is just a broad construct which includes all possible and 
      self-contradictory beliefs and is not at all meaningful in the sense of 
      logic. If you are going to really bet on something, you must define that 
      criterion - which means picking of something. If you pick nothing or 
      something that is vaguely defined, then your &quot;belief&quot; is literally empty 
      and your status remains no more than an atheist. So, a person who picks risks picking the wrong 
      god and avoiding the wrong hell.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">This leads to a second

      Wager: Is It Safer To Believe In God Even If There Is No Proof That One 
      Exists?</a>&quot; : </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&quot;Many Agnostics, for example, have evaluated 
        all the &quot;proofs&quot; for God's existence, and all of the &quot;proofs&quot; of God's 
        non-existence. They conclude that neither belief can be substantiated. 
        They feel that they can not rationally believe in the existence or 
        non-existence of God; they must remain Agnostic. Under these conditions, 
        a person can only believe in God if they violate their honesty. And God 
        might punish a lack of honestly more severely than not being able to 
        believe in God.</p>
        <p align="justify">It can also be argued that if people believe 
        something on insufficient evidence, that the result is the promoting of 
        credulity -- something that harms society. Again, that could be a sin 
        that God is particularly concerned about punishing.&quot;</p>

    <span style="background-color: #99FFCC">Test of God?</span></font></b></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">One might also argue that a 
    false, evil image of God has been forced to trust where God engages to test 
    the blind obedience or faith, and&nbsp; justifies His Gödel acts thru 
    threats, coerce and/or promises of heavenly reward. Aroj Ali Matubbar in his 
    book Shotter Shondhaney (<a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/aroj_ali/">Quest 
    for truth</a>) uttered -</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&quot;It is said that nothing happens without the 
      permission of Allah. Not even the leaf of a tree can tremble without his 
      consent. Indeed, if something can happen against His will or without His 
      consent His omnipotence will be called in question. But if everything 
      happens according to His will what is the fault or sin of the offender?&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">From the above point of 
    view, some might argue that an insincere wager is worthless. God, being 
    omniscient and omnipotent, knows all our motivations. If a person decides to 
    be atheist or non-believer, he is somehow fulfilling God's plan and wish, 
    one may argue. Obviously, no one can go against his will otherwise&nbsp; His 
    omnipotence will be in question. So the tests and bets all becomes 
    meaningless on this point of singularity! </font></p>

    <span style="background-color: #99FFCC">Should such &quot;Racist God&quot; be 
    worshipped?</span></font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">One final issue needs to 
      be mentioned: the conclusion of the argument is supposed to be for the 
      person to believe in a god because it is the choice that offers the most 
      benefits and least dangers. However, this requires that <strong>the god in 
      question not mind that you believe in it merely in order to gain entrance 
      to heaven and/or to avoid punishment in hell. But this means that this god 
      isn't actually a just or fair god since a person's eternal fate is not 
      being decided upon based on their actions, but merely on their decision to 
      make a pragmatic and selfish choice of religion. </strong>I don't know 
      about the believers, but that certainly isn't the sort of god a rational 
      person would ever consider for worshiping. </font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">If we believe in such 
      &quot;Racist God&quot; what actually we got to lose, one might ask. Pascal will 
      obviously assure you with heavenly bliss - &quot;You lose nothing&quot;. However,&nbsp; 
      this is a questionable premise whether such parochial view is acceptable 
      on the basis of sound ethics and morality. In his book&nbsp;
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/087975124X/InternetInfidels/">
      Atheism: The Case Against God</a>, George H. Smith exposed the fallacies 
      by saying&nbsp; this: </font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify">What have we got to lose? Intellectual integrity, 
        self-esteem, and a passionate, rewarding life for starters. In short, 
        everything that makes life worth living. Far from being a safe bet, 
        Pascal's wager requires the wager of one's life and happiness 
        (Prometheus Books, 1979, p. 184).</p>

    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="-1">In conclusion, it should 
    have become abundantly clear over the course of this essay that
    <strong style="font-weight: 400"><em style="font-style: normal">Pascal's
