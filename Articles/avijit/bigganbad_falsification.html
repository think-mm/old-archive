	<font face="Verdana">I don’t want to take our debate to typical cyber “<i>Bangali 
	Jhogra</i>” that is very much evident in all typical Bengali forums. 
	Normally most of the cases, a thread starts with innocent disagreement but 
	ultimately ends with personal attack. I thought ours will be different. But, 
	unfortunately, after reading your last response I had to think whether it’s 
	really worthy to continue the debate. I seriously do not want to take our 
	discussion in a heated nasty clash as we both know each others’ position 
	pretty well. Your last response shows perhaps you’ve become frustrated 
	dealing with the issue over and over, hence to much irrelevant comment was 
	made. For example:&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">a) Though you have written a book on science … it is 
	clear, deep down in your mind, you also understand a set of a laws as 
	science! Which is common among students of subcontinents,..</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">b) I am surprised a logical person like you is bringing 
	this point…. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">c) Why Muslims hate non-muslims and love their 
	brotherhood? Biologically intrinsic? kidding me! Poor you!</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">d) Your statement is a proof of your ignorance in 
	statistical method. Etc..</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">This kind of <i>Ad Hominem</i> attack is a general 
	category of fallacy because irrelevant attack against the character of 
	person making the claim, his/her circumstances, or his/her actions cannot 
	give any lift logically, in any debate. If you think making personal attack 
	will lead you to winning situation, then I have nothing much to say. 
	However, I will try one more time (may be this is the last time) to clarify 
	my position. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">I gave enough evidences in my previous write-ups that 
	beauty is a relative thing. My idea of beauty may differ from another 
	person’s concept of beauty. This does not mean that the concept of beauty 
	changes at all, just my perspective of it is different. In a nutshell, 
	relative truths (there is a scientific definition of this term; for ref. see
	<b><i>sokal’s book</i></b>) change with time and perspective. They are 
	useful in experiencing the world around us, but are different for each 
	individual. Some criterion like beauty, poetic artwork, literary values are 
	sometimes impossible to define, and must be understood largely on the basis 
	of personal experience, not by any strict scientific laws. It seems you do 
	not want to agree, even though you are aware of the facts. You used 
	“statistical methods” to calculate majority people’s taste and called the 
	process scientific. I agree that you maintained a scientific process here. 
	However, just following a scientific process in any matter does not 
	necessarily lead to scientific reality. Astrologers also sometimes uses 
	statistics or mathematics to calculate individual’s fate (I have seen some 
	astrologers even uses computer to generate the result), but that undoubtedly 
	does not make astrology scientific. Willium Dembski is also using lot of 
	statistical theory for formulating thesis on ID (he even claims that his 
	mathematics have replaced Darwinism), which also does not make it 
	‘scientific’ to the scientific community. Just Scientific Language or some 
	statistics does not Make a topic Scientific [For details pls. check : How 
	Thinking Goes Wrong Twenty-five Fallacies that Lead Us to Believe Weird 
	Things, by Michael Shermer]. This is a danger that Sokal and Bricmont 
	pointed in their “<b><i>Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' 
	Abuse of Science</i></b>” explaining why they feel that each is misusing 
	specific scientific concepts without understanding their scientific meaning. 
	Even if we want to use “statistics” here we should not debate anymore; as 
	all of the members (at least 4 out of 5) responded to the thread disagreed 
	with your view. So will you accept that your theory was wrong based on this 
	statistical result?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">You said, “Your statement is a proof of your ignorance 
	in statistical method.” I am afraid it’s you who are not aware how 
	scientific method works. Science is no politics, it’s rarely any matter how 
	much vote one can obtain like a political leader in a competition. Also 
	please think that if Aishwaria did not appear in world beauty contest &nbsp;(he 
	could have made that decision) and did not come to the world of hindi 
	movies, only few people would be aware of her “beauty”. Certainly she would 
	not be in the top list in such popularity vote. However, not attaining a 
	competition does not mean that the beauty of Aishwaria can be changed at 
	all, only truth is people would not be aware of her “beauty”. You so called 
	“scientific” analysis completely missed this point. And you are suggesting 
	me to learn statistics! &nbsp;Same goes to your citation of “Algorithmic 
	evolution of subjective prose” or kind of “poetic software” which cannot 
	produce a Lalon, Tagore or Shakespeare (or Picasso in the world of art). 
	Artistic/poetic genius is more than your stated poor algorithm, and of 
	course still in the area of subjective judgment. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Again, arguing with you it gave me impression that you 
	are also not aware of the logical fallacies like – “<i>Argumentum ad numerum</i>” 
	and “<i>Argumentum ad populum</i>” while you propose majority vote as a 
	criterion in a scientific analysis. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">You have some other important flaws in your analogy. 
	Let me remind you from where the main conflict started. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">[1] You used a term “scientism” in one of your messages 
	(message # 27919) and wrote a Bangla piece on “bigganbad”. However some 
	members showed the definition (dogmatic form) of scientism and you shifted 
	your position saying, you did not mean it rather you meant scientific 
	methodology (which is already an established term, why we need Biggan baad 
	then, is still beyond my understanding!).<i> Scientism</i> is a century old 
	term which has already been rejected by many sociologists, economists and 
	even the scientists again and again for it’s own self-annihilating view. And 
	any ‘ism’, I clarified many times, represents just a specific doctrine, 
	cannot be a representative of complete&nbsp; science. You are somehow 
	overlooking the important aspect, Biplab. Let’s see how you fell in your own 
	loop-hole while preaching ‘scientism’. You criticized Marxism for being 
	dogmatic/unscientific for using it in political aspect (check your <i>
	Marxism ki biggan?</i>), however it is you who argued that you want to make 
	use of science politically (scientism) to fight against Mullahs. How much 
	different is this approach? Please check :This is what you wrote in 
	“Bigganbad ekti purnango dorshon” :&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">“.. Birodhider kono rajnoitik Dorshon nei, Nana Munir 
	nana Mot. Nanan Dol. Moulobadider biruddhe ebhabe ki lorai shombhob? …chai 
	shoktishali dorshon. Ekmatro Bigganei pawa shombhob”&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">This is purely self-contradictory. Again, you accused 
	Marx and Lenin for not to be skeptical about their own theories or 
	conclusions, however, I also find the same attitude in your writing too :) &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">[2] Your Bangla article started defining <i>scientism</i> 
	by formulating hypothesis. However conclusions you drawn many times are 
	oversimplified and self contradictory. For example, to formulate the root 
	cause of Islamic terrorism you have pointed two mutually exclusive factors – 
	Islam’s teaching vs US policy; this is a typical example of &quot;black and 
	white&quot; / &quot;false dichotomy&quot; or bifurcation as it presents a situation as 
	having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can 
	exist (For example, socio-political reasons for raising of Islamism 
	basically in ‘80s: example : decolonization such as Ba'athism, Arab 
	Nationalism, vigor in the Iran-Iraq War, conflict against the Soviet Union 
	in Afghanistan, Zia-ul-Haq’s exploitation Islamist sentiments, Khomeini’s 
	revolution etc. ). Your “Bigganbaadi” conclusion (especially for mukto-mona) 
	came from a wrong hypothesis, which I think, is inevitable if one follows 
	the philosophy of scientism dogmatically. See, this is what you argued :&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">“Abar Keo Keo bolchen Koran ebong America ubhoyi shoman

	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Mukto-Mona did not preach Koran and/or US – such silly 
	bifurcation, let alone be it “equally” (another intentional mistake of 
	yours) responsible. I wonder what let you take such silly conclusion. 
	Scientism?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">[3] Your “Bigganbaadi” conclusion on divorce is also a 
	classic example how Bigganbad can be promoted as a dogma. &nbsp;This is what you 
	exactly argued :&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">“Shontan Dharoner por Divorce kono motei kammyo noy.

	na”&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">See how desperate you are in preaching your own biased 
	conclusion in the name of “Bigganbaad”. It can be argued that divorce is 
	very closely associated with women’s liberation and women’s rights issue. 
	All these centuries, religion and society did not let us fight against the 
	oppression on women; they were forced to stay in a marriage because they had 
	no other choice. It is really interesting and entertaining to see that you 
	are also coming to the same conclusion with your ‘bigganbaad’. So, an abused 
	woman has to stay in an abusive marriage only because of bigganbaad; at 
	least your theory suggests so. If it’s not dogmatic, what it is!&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">In the same respect I wish to remind you how by 
	implementing Darwin's theory of evolution in social context with a hidden 
	agenda, some “scientists” once tried to associate in the public mind with 
	racism, imperialism, eugenics etc. Hope your enthusiasm for scientism would 
	not be of this kind.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">[4] In general I agree the method of falsifiability in 
	the case of strict scientific (experimental) research at least; however we 
	must also know even in those scientific realm many “real” physicists, 
	including Nobel Prize winner Steven Weinberg (in case of string theory he 
	rejected Popper) and Alan Sokal, have criticized falsifiability on the 
	grounds that it does not accurately describe the way science really works. 
	For e.g, Sokal writes,&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&quot;When a theory successfully withstands an attempt at 
	falsification, a scientist will, quite naturally, consider the theory to be 
	partially confirmed and will accord it a greater likelihood or a higher 
	subjective probability. ... But Popper will have none of this: throughout 
	his life he was a stubborn opponent of any idea of 'confirmation' of a 
	theory, or even of its 'probability'. ... [but] the history of science 
	teaches us that scientific theories come to be accepted above all because of 
	their successes.&quot; [Ref :
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability">
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability</a> &nbsp;]&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Let me give some precise examples to show the 
	limitation of falsifiability: &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">a) Astrology is an example which most rational people 
	would agree is not science. However, if we follow Popper’s theory, it has to 
	be a part of science, cause, astrology constantly makes falsifiable 
	predictions -- a new set is printed every day in the newspapers -- yet only 
	few dogmatics would argue this makes it scientific.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Now lets focus on the opposite scenario. Most most 
	rational people would agree that <u>psychology</u> is a branch of science 
	whereas <u>parapsychology</u> is pseudoscience. However, Popper's theory 
	cannot distinguish between these two. Popper in fact denounced 
	psychoanalytic theory as nonscientific (and useless), as its difficult to 
	falsify. It was indeed a shock to the psychoanalytic community. Karl 
	Svozil's paper &quot;The dangerous misconceptions of Karl Popper&quot; addressed the 
	issue in detail.&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">b) The proposition that the patient is homosexual is 
	not falsifiable as according to Popper’s theory, there is no way the patient 
	could convincingly demonstrate his heterosexuality to the analyst ( check
	<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_circle">
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_circle</a> &nbsp;for details). This 
	eventfully can lead to another dangerous proposition; some may argue 
	supporting homosexuality right is not scientific (your “scientism” would 
	surely lead to this conclusion). Now check your very simplified conclusion 
	on divorce etc, you will get your answer where you were wrong. I do not 
	consider that your wrong conclusion is just a lack of hypothesis, rather 
	inevitable loop of holes for following “scientism” dogmatically. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">c) Another good example can be cited from laws of 
	physics: remember - Isaac Newton's laws of motion in their original form 
	were falsified by experiments in the twentieth century (eg, the anomaly of 
	the motion of Mercury, the behavior of light passing sufficiently close to a 
	star, the behavior of particle being accelerated in a cyclotron, etc), and 
	replaced by a theory which predicted those phenomena, General Relativity, 
	though Newton's account of motion is still a good enough approximation for 
	most human needs. It’s not still “entirely” rejected. Now I give exactly 
	opposite examples in the following passages:&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Consider “Super String” theory where string is 
	considered as one dimensional object which is yet to be verified 
	experimentally. Many scientists think it’s really impossible to 
	experimentally verify this theory, even though they accept the theory as 
	scientific. But, it is not a falsifiable theory in the sense of Popper. Now 
	please let me know your opinion - whether it’s really a scientific theory 
	(Please do not argue that String models have mathematical formulations etc. 
	Astrology or Ptolemy’s geocentric models also had mathematical 
	formulations). &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Another good example in physics is <i>Higgs field</i>, 
	which has not experimentally verified (Check the book <b><i>The Fabric of 
	Cosmos</i></b> by Brian Green, pp 269) in a sense that observations do not 
	prove that Higgs field exist. It’s kind a like (but not exactly) a concept 
	of Eather. Obviously, these concepts are not falsifiable in the strict sense 
	of Popper, but still considered as scientific to almost all physicists. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">d) Thomas Kuhn’s influential book <b><i>The Structure 
	of Scientific Revolutions</i></b> argued that scientists work in a series of 
	paradigms, and found little evidence of scientists actually following a 
	falsificationist methodology. His argument was totally opposite of what 
	popper’s theory. Personally I think scientific research proceeds accepting 
	delicate balance of both Khun and Popper. &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Perhaps you know that &nbsp;Popper's student Imre Lakatos 
	(later an influential philosopher) attempted to reconcile Kuhn’s work with 
	falsificationism by arguing that science &nbsp;progresses by the falsification of 
	research programs rather than the more specific universal statements of 
	naïve falsificationism (this is where I argue). Stefania Jha, in his paper, 
	“Popper transcended – the Lakatos – Polanyi connection” commented :</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
		<font face="Verdana">Popper opposed Lakatos’s several attempts to 
		improve his doctrines instead of promoting Popperism. Lakatos saw that 
		Popper’s formulation of the logic of scientific discovery and the logic 
		of research, although had the merit of simplicity, was not based on 
		fact. No significant scientific discovery in history was made by 
		Popper’s method.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Another of Popper’s students Paul Feyerabend (another 
	influential philosopher) ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology, 
	and argued that the only universal method characterizing scientific progress 
	was anything goes.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">Another good argument was put forward by Martin Gardner 
	(</font><a class="external text" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20040212023313/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/gardner popper.html" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040212023313/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/gardner_popper.html"><i>A 
	Skeptical Look at Karl Popper</i></a> <font face="Verdana">) where he 
	pointed out that&nbsp; Falsifications can be as fuzzy and elusive as 
	confirmations. He provided a very good example. &quot;Einstein's first 
	cosmological model was a universe as static and unchanging as Aristotle's. 
	Unfortunately, the gravity of suns would make such a universe unstable. It 
	would collapse. To prevent this, Einstein, out of thin air, proposed the 
	bold conjecture that the universe, on its pre-atomic level, harbored a 
	mysterious, undetected repulsive force he called the &quot;cosmological 
	constant.&quot; When it was discovered that the universe is expanding, Einstein 
	considered his conjecture falsified. Indeed, he called it &quot;the greatest 
	blunder of my life.&quot; Today, his conjecture is back in favor as a way of 
	explaining why the universe seems to be expanding faster than it should. 
	Astronomers are not trying to falsify it; they are looking for 
	confirmations&quot;.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">e) Popper himself argued that Marxism was not science. 
	Again, this does not mean, that any of these types of theories are 
	necessarily invalid or unacceptable (just as gay rights/divorce rights etc.) 
	in the society. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories 
	are scientific, not of whether theories are valid. Many sociologist today 
	argue that social theory does not needed to be falsifiable always (I am not 
	arguing for Marxism here, just giving a thought whether falsifiability can 
	be taken seriously as a sole criterion for social/political/cultural 
	acceptance). &nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
	<font face="Verdana">f) Many argues that falsificationism in its various 
	forms is an interesting idea but insufficient either to characterize science 
	or solve the demarcation problem. It suffers from a series of logical and 
	philosophical difficulties that should perhaps give us pause if hoping to 
	find a single answer to what makes good science and what does not. Please

	&nbsp;Again Biplab, my intention is not to make you frustrated and put you in an 
	attacking or defensive mode. I thought we can both learn and grow from our 
	friendly interchange. If you keep on attacking me on silly issue without 
	understanding my points, then please consider this as my last response in
