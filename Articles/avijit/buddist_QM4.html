	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Response: </b>Hmm. Ksanika 
	philosophy can explain quantum mechanics better than existing quantum 
	theories? I wonder why physics students are studying plank hypothesis, wave 
	particle duality, uncertainty principle, photo electric effect, Schrodinger 
	Equation, Bose-Einstein distribution etc by attending physics courses. 
	ksanika itself should be enough. It's a shame that west did not include, or 
	not even mentioned the great Buddhist contribution in physics! Must be some 
	conspiracy of the west! Readers might get some similarity with those 
	Bangladeshi Muslim apologists also claim that the Qur'an predicted the 
	expanding universe, long before Hubble discovered it in twentieth century. 
	Who needs to know about the Hubble expansion through Einstein's theory, if 
	Qur'an had made such prescient 'predictions,' one should seriously ponder.

	Paul Dirac, Richard Feynman and others. If Vir is right, then they all did a 
	redundant and senseless job! You know what, Vir? If you start looking in any 
	ancient history of human civilization, I am sure you can find some &quot;Joe&quot;'s 
	who in some perspective somewhere might have said &quot;all are relative&quot; long 
	before Einstein formulated his theory of relativity in physics. You are not 
	suggesting that &quot;Joe&quot; knew better physics that Einstein and that Joe should 
	be given all the credit for inventing that theory of relativity, do you? No

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Response: </b>It is not clear to 
	me what you are trying to infer. Electron does spin; I will touch on the 
	topic in later part of my response. Let me state few words on Gama radiation 
	for time being. Gamma rays are indirectly ionising radiation (i.e it carries 
	enough energy to ionize an atom or molecule), whereas our visible light is 
	not. When a gamma ray passes through matter it undergoes an interaction with 
	an atomic particle, usually an electron. During this interaction, energy is 
	transferred from the gamma ray to the electron, which is a directly ionising 
	particle. As a result of this energy transfer, the electron is liberated 
	from the atom and proceeds to ionize matter by colliding with other 
	electrons along its path. This is a very common phenomenon in physics. I 
	don't see anything wrong or any contradiction in such interpretation, what 
	your Ksanika philosophy is trying to infer? </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Response:</b> No, not true. 
	Electrons do spin. An electron spin, normally represented by s = 1/2 
	(electrons have intrinsic angular momentum characterized by quantum number 
	1/2) is an intrinsic property of electrons. Two types of experimental 
	evidence arose in the 1920s that clearly suggested this property of the 
	electron. In 1921, Otto Stern and Walter Gerlach performed an experiment 
	which showed the quantization of electron spin into two orientations. This 
	was in fact a major contribution to the development of the quantum theory of 
	the atom. Another evidence of electron spin is the closely spaced splitting 
	of the hydrogen spectral lines, called fine structure. When the spectral 
	lines of the hydrogen spectrum are examined at very high resolution, they 
	are found to be closely-spaced doublets. This splitting is called fine 
	structure and was one of the first experimental evidences for electron spin. 
	If Buddhist philosophy really suggests that electrons do not spin, the 
	philosophy is wrong. One should try to accept this reality. Your attitude is 
	like those Muslims who rejects the theory of evolution just because Quran 
	does not support. Absolute belief in scripture is no science per se as it is 
	not subject to experimentation, prediction, revision or falsification. To 
	the believer, these scientific process or experimental evidences are 
	irrelevant though, because they believe they possess the &quot;truth&quot; as set 
	forth by the biblical, Quranic or Buddhist scripture. </font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Response:</b> I have no problem 
	if one keep on propagating pseudo-science in the name of Islam, Hinduism, 
	Buddhism or whatever, as long as internet is free:-), however sometimes a 
	strong rebuttal would be owed as a debt. Many apologists originated form 
	Islam, Hinduism, or Christian faith are nowadays quite desperate to &quot;prove&quot; 
	that their respective scriptures are much advanced in describing modern 
	scientific facts and discoveries. They can now easily find Big bang, 
	Embryology, Quantum physics, astrophysics, human genome -every single stuff 
	of modern science in those vague pun, quote, allegories of century old 
	religious scriptures. We have seen Mauris Bucaille's dire attempt in his 
	&quot;Bible Quran and Science&quot;, we also have R R. Mohan Roy's &quot;Vedic physics&quot;, we 
	did not forget Gerald L. Schroeder's &quot;Genesis and the Big Bang&quot; and many 
	others of such kind. Now we've got Buddha-physics in our list in addition to 
	to those which has been emphatically claimed 1100/1200 years ahead of modern 
	science! Nonetheless the truth is, none of the modern scientific discoveries 
	were inspired from, dependent on, any of the religious revelations and 
	interestingly enough, its always AFTER the scientific fact that these 
	&quot;miraculous advancement&quot; in scriptures are found; it has never been found 
	BEFORE the modern scientific discovery. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In my previous post I asked Vir 
	Gupta to enlighten me how Lord Buddha solved theory of noncommuting 
	operators, or Hamilton-Jaccobi equation of motion to infer wave equation. 
	Also I asked him to cite the name of scientific journals (Nature, Science, 
	Physical review, Physics Letters etc...) that used Buddha's mathematical 
	derivation. Vir wrote a lengthy piece in response, just avoiding my 
	questions which I exactly called for in last reply.</font></p>
