	of the regular contributors of Mukto-Mona forum has recently accused us for 
	propagating hate.&nbsp; I have read
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/47775">Mr. Gani’s 
	lengthy piece</a> and I
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/47776">responded

	<O>The Accusation </O></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Gani accused 
	MM for spreading especially racially motivated (on Muslims) and aggressive 
	comment. In his words-<i> “MM moderators have freely been disseminating 
	those views of expressive harms without any remorse.”</i></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Such Accusation of 
	Mr. Gani is not new. &nbsp;He wrote similar lengthy piece on NFB - 01 Sept. 2006 
	and accused MM for hurting billion Muslims in Bangladesh and beyond. Our 
	moderator </font>
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mukto-mona/message/36096">
	<font face="Verdana" color="#606420">Jahed Ahmed instantly refuted such 
	allegation</font></a><font face="Verdana"> &nbsp;by saying –</font><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">“Mr. Gani 
		thinks, mukto-mona is hurting the sentiments of millions of people in
		<ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>, destroying family values, and we are forcing 
		people into recanting ancestor&#39;s beliefs/religions. So flattering for us 
		to learn, we exert so much influence on peoples&#39; mind! Yet I need to 
		make a point here. At mukto-mona, we mainly deal with issues that we 
		believe are dogmatic, irrational and unscientific. If any such issues 
		coincides with some one&#39;s own definition of a &quot;family value&quot;, 
		&quot;religion&quot;, &quot;religious ritual&quot; etc, we simply won&#39;t stop from doing it. 
		We know, even icons like Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, Ram Mohan Roy, Kazi 
		Nazrul Islam were once accused of having &quot;destroyed religions/cultures&quot;, 
		etc. What if they stopped? Would the necessary reformation/change have 
		taken place? Or take the example of Mary Wollstonecraft&#39;s &quot;A Vindication 
		of the Rights of Women.&quot; Didn&#39;t many say she was putting whole order of 
		the society up side down by espousing equal rights for women? Same holds 
		true for late Quazi Abdul Wadud, Quazi Motahar Hossain, Prof. Ahmed 
		Shariff, Aroj Ali Matubbor et al of
		<ST1>Bangladesh</ST1>.” (MM Message #36096)</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I found Mr. Gani&#39;s 
	new article nothing but the old, unpalatable, empiricist wine in a new 
	bottle, which we had refuted many times. I would like to respond to this 
	accusation one more time perhaps.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have seen time 
	to time that Muslim fundamentalists certainly think of mukto-mona just as a 
	creation of some &quot;anti-Muslim&quot; gang with vested interest. &nbsp;Mr. Gani’s view 
	is in-line of that notion. However, Had Mr. Gani been smart enough, he would 
	have noticed that Hindu and other fanatics also curse Mukto-Mona, but 
	completely for opposite reason - i.e, for 
	favoring the Muslims. Just few days ago, one devout hindu was accusing MM 
	writers for becoming “Al-Mahmud” and “Anwar Zahid”, the reason was, MM core 
	members and moderators were very vocal against unjustified <ST1>Iraq</ST1> 
	war and racial approach against Muslims. If we were so racist against 
	Muslims then why did we protest at that time? You cannot have both ways, Mr. 
	Gani. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The matter should 
	be clear by now. We were against all kinds of social injustices, religious 
	and oppressive dogmas, doctrines, and discriminations.&nbsp; We critiqued 
	everything that hindered people&#39;s access to civil liberty, freedom, 
	democracy and secularism.&nbsp; We took a strong stand against all kinds of human 
	rights violations such as oppression of ethnic/religious minority community 
	and gender-based discriminations against women, homosexuals and others, and 
	we have proven it time to time. &nbsp;Our project, our past petitions and the 
	articles are the proof. We had written petition when hindu fanatics 
	destroyed the Babri mosque, &nbsp;appealed for Gujarat Genocide Trials, against 
	Hindutva Vandalism on Renowned Artist M F Hussain’s Paintings etc. &nbsp;What 
	type of racism is Mr. Gani talking about? </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana">Undeserved Respect</font></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mr. Gani is ‘so 
	anxious’ for hurting religious sentiment of the Muslims that he even 
	bothered to compare us with &#39;KKK&#39;.&nbsp; I understand from where his anxiety 
	is coming. It is a widespread assumption, or more precisely an universal 
	truth for them - that religious feelings is vulnerable to offence and should 
	be protected by an abnormally thick wall of &#39;respect&#39;, in a different 
	category from the respect that any human being should pay to any other.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	&nbsp;But before tackling such argument, let me site few quotes from past 
	history. Thomas Paine, one of the greatest humanists of his time once 
	uttered about Bible -</font><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
	<blockquote dir="ltr">

		has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy or 
		whatever. That&#39;s an idea we&#39;re so familiar with, whether we subscribe to 
		it or not, that it&#39;s kind of odd to think what it actually means, 
		because really what it means is &#39;Here is an idea or a notion that you&#39;re 
		not allowed to say anything bad about; you&#39;re just not. Why not? - 
		because you&#39;re not!&#39; If somebody votes for a party that you don&#39;t agree 
		with, you&#39;re free to argue about it as much as you like; everybody will 
		have an argument but nobody feels aggrieved by it. If somebody thinks 
		taxes should go up or down you are free to have an argument about it,

		about who created the Universe, no, that&#39;s holy? What does that mean? 
		Why do we ring-fence that for any other reason other than that we&#39;ve 
		just got used to doing so? There&#39;s no other reason at all, it&#39;s just one 
		of those things that crept into being and once that loop gets going it&#39;s 
		very, very powerful. So, we are used to not challenging religious ideas 
		but it&#39;s very interesting how much of a furore Richard creates when he 
		does it! Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it because you&#39;re not 
		allowed to say these things. Yet when you look at it rationally there is 
		no reason why those ideas shouldn&#39;t be as open to debate as any other,

	<p class="MsoNormal"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Religion is so 
	entrenched in the mind of the people like Mohammad Gani &nbsp;that they &nbsp;have 
	been able to foist off onto popular culture the notion that religion should 
	always deserve a kid glove treatment. What an irony! &nbsp;Republicans can 
	criticize the political philosophy of Democrats and vice versa. BNP can 
	criticize the political ideology of AL, Jamat can criticize ‘equal right for 
	women’ when they think it anti-islamic. Socialists and capitalists can 
	criticize each other&#39;s basic worldview. However, to the people like Mr. Gani, 
	religious beliefs must be above from any kind piercing criticism. If you 
	criticize, you will be a hatemonger -a “KKK”. This is a typical example of 
	our society&#39;s overweening respect for religion.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">If his religious 
	sentiment is being hurt by the criticism of MM writers, then be with it! If 
	he cant get rid of his ambiguous hysterical &#39;hurt&#39; thingee- then 
	please do not blame us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not in a favor of offending or 
	hurting anyone just for the sake of it. However, we think, there is 
	definitely a time and place to make religion look as ridiculous as it 
	actually is. When I am writing the 
	article, the hundreds of mullahs clashing with police the city&#39;s Baitul 
	Mukarram National Mosque area.&nbsp; They are aggressively opposing the 
	equal rights for women. The reason is quite clear. Allah preaches the 
	superiority of men by confirming that men have an advantage over the women 
	(Q. <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.228">2:228</a>). 
	Quran not only denies women&#39;s equal right to their inheritance (Q.
	<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/004.qmt.html#004.011">4:11-12</a>), 
	it also regards them as imbeciles and decrees that their testimony is not 
	admissible in the court of law unless it is accompanied with the testimony 
	of a man (Q.
	<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.282">2:282</a>). 
	Mullahs are abiding by Quran, the holy book. </font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Will it be a hate, if 
	we point out this? There is definitely a time and place to emphasize the 
	opportunities awaiting a person who lives a life free of superstition. Mukto-Mona 
	has been awarded prestigious Jahanara Imam Memorial Medal recently for 
	making significant contribution in the movement for establishing humanism, 
	rationalism and scientific mindset among the people. Many popular media 
	including Daily star or German Bangla Radio have taken interviews and 
	published those with due importance. MM books have already made a quick land 
	marks Mr. Gani should ask himself &nbsp;who is preaching real hate – is this 
	Mukto-Mona or he himself - taking this onerous duty on himself to propagate 
	name calling among Bangalee readers?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><O><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></O></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I would also like 
	to point out that while criticizing a particular dogma, it is also important 
	to make the proper distinction between Muslims and Islam. Muslims are 
	people, human beings like you and I and that’s why many of our members voice 
	for the rights of <ST1>oppressed people of Palestine</ST1> or Kashmiris or 
	stood against Iraq war, even though they criticize Islam as a dogma. I 
	wonder whether Mr. Gani will ever realize that!</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Apparently, I have not seen Mr. Gani 
	raising his voice when an atheist Professor Humayun Azad&#39;s&nbsp; neck had been 
	chopped off by religious fanatics, neither had he been noticed to do 
	anything when&nbsp; religious fundamentalists issuing fatwas against the 
	freethinkers of Bangladesh or calling&nbsp; them Murtad and seeking death 
	penalty. He does not think that anybody like us has any right of getting hurt when&nbsp; Shamsher Ali&nbsp; spreads 
	sleazy lies to make his religion &#39;super-scientific&#39; by 
	capturing all the news and government media, and to our surprise, the state promotes 
	him 
	disgracefully. Mr. Gani probably&nbsp; will not find anything wrong when he sees 
	that&nbsp; the non-believers like us have to start our day listening so-called 
	Quran-Telwat or other religious recitation, which many of us do not want to, but 
	forced to by state-patronization!&nbsp; He does not find anything wrong when 
	state also patronizes Baitul Mukram&#39;s Khatib to spread Jihad against the 
	infidels on each Khutba on Jumma. For him, so called &#39;sentiment&#39; and 
	a &#39;ground for getting hurt&#39; should lie only in the domain of a believer like him, and not 
	to any infidel community. Indeed their &#39;religious sentiment&#39; is 
	quite precious!</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The list can go 
	on.&nbsp; The history of religion is indeed a horror story. Mind it, the 
	above list documents only few incidents of killing, raping, and mass murder 
	from religious hatred - the real horror story is far beyond imagination. If Mr. Gani doubts 
	it, just review this chronicle of religion&#39;s gore during the last 1,000 
	years or so. I would like to recommend ‘<i>Holy Horrors: An Illustrated History 
	of Religious Murder and Madness</i>’ by James A. Haught and <i>&#39;God Is Not Great: How 
	Religion Poisons Everything&#39;</i> by Christopher Hitchens to him. &nbsp;In 
	another book, &#39;<i>Is religion killing us?</i>&#39; Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer explores the 
	relationship between religion and violence in Christianity, Judaism and 
	Islam. He concluded, &quot;Violence is widely embraced because it is embedded and 
	sanctified in sacred texts and because its use seems logical in a violent 
	world&quot;. Mukto-Monas are not to kill each other but instead, to warn against 
	such real hate and persecution that really killed the ‘real people’.</font></p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now the important

	cover-up the incidents of holy-hate time to time by name-calling Bengali 
	freethinkers? Readers are here to judge.&nbsp; </font></p>
