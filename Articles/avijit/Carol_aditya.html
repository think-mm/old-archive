<p>Dear Aditya:</p>
<p>I have posted my response to Atheist-talk news group, however, I did not see 
my stuff got posted there. Rationally I am assuming that &quot;Human Carol&quot; is so 
disturbed&nbsp; that he has to censor my message. Not quite surprising from 
&quot;liberal atheists&quot;!</p>
<p>==========================</p>
<p>My apology if MM has subscribed any of the members without their permission. 
It could be because I have forwared some message to our enthusiastic moderator 
from this newsgroup and he added them in the list. whatever the reason, A 
sincere apology on my behalf. I already unsubscribed from&nbsp; those (including 
&quot;Human Carol&quot;) long time ago I got complain. </p>
<p>I also found myself in this group &quot;Atheist-talk&quot; as somebody added me in the 
list, and I did not mind!&nbsp; Again, It is not possible for me to participate 
each and every group in the net that I have been added/invited. If someone think 
just for my lack of participation in any group,&nbsp; I am spamming, I have 
nothing much to say. I have respect in his/her judgment. No hard feelings. I am 
unsubscribing from the renowned and prestigious &quot;Atheist list&quot;. </p>
<p>Sorry any kind of inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>Avijit. </p>
<p>P.S. Human carol found peculiarity in MM's message. Since when he/she became 
the judge of another forum with diverse/different culture which is completely 
unknown to him? What if I also accuse the same &quot;peculiarity&quot; about his/her forum 
too while some poster posted&nbsp; his nonsense with a title, &quot;Tsunami was a 
good thing&quot;??????</p>
<p>You might want to forward my message to the group as i have been censored!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can vouch for Avjit Roy and his group and it is<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not a spam.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I didn't suggest it was &quot;a spam.&quot; (did you mean &quot;a scam&quot;)<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I suggested that Avjit Roy, by posting that message all over the<br>
&gt; place--in multiple groups where he doesn't personally participate, is<br>
&gt; spamming, and the posts that he deposits in a hit-and-run fashion<br>
&gt; qualify as spam, as far as I am concerned.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have met him personally in Singapore where he<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lives now.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He is a genuine atheist activist and although his group caters<br>
&gt; mostly to Bangladeshi atheists and agnostics, I can recommend it to<br>
&gt; any one interested in current issues.<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not aware of any one who has been subscribed to<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; his list against his wish.&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; You are aware of such a thing now.</p>
