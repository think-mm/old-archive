<p>Exactly my point, Biplab! I have no problem considering Vivekananda as a 
&quot;good diplomat&quot;, but making him the incarnation of a Hindu deity with heavenly 
halo is ridiculous, if not stupid!</p>
<p>Indeed Swami Vivekananda was a good diplomat, and that's why he advised the 
editor of Bhrammabadin to praise Bhrahmins in one issue, and then praise 
Khatrias in the next issue, and then praise Baisyas (Ref. Potraboli, Potro 
number 476). </p>
<p>BTW, I don't think I exaggerated anything in my piece. The quotes I used in 
my article are all from authentic sources including Vivekananda Rachanaboli and 
the related books (&quot;Vaani O rochona&quot;, &quot;Potraboli&quot; of Vivekananda and &quot;Swamiji k 
jerup dekhechhi&quot; by Nibedita, and &quot;Vivekananda O Shomokalin Bharatbarsha&quot; by 
Sankariprasad Basu) I mentioned in my last piece. Besides my previous 
enumerations, I can cite many other examples in support of his casteism. For 
example, he once wrote to Indumoti to write &quot;Dev&quot; or &quot;Devi&quot; before Bhrahmins but 
&quot;Dash&quot; or &quot;Dashi&quot; before Shudra. (Bani O rochona, pp 392). He also mentioned&nbsp; 
in one place - &quot;Jonnmonmesh holew Kumor Kumori thakbe...&quot;. But ofcourse, He did 
not support castiesm each and everywhere, in fact in many cases he opposed it. 
You may call it diplomacy, but I see it as a clear contradiction. Vivekananda is 
a figuret person no doubt, but in many cases I found him self-contradictory. </p>
<p>Most amusing remark of Vivekananda is&nbsp; &quot;Books did more evil than good to 
the society&quot;. Here is the exact quote&nbsp; (Bani O Rochona, 4th part, Page : 
113, 131, 144):</p>
<p>&quot;Grontho dara Jogote bhalo opekkha mondo Odhik Hoiyachhe&quot;. </p>
<p>&quot;Joto Kom Porbe toto tomader mongol&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Jotota janile Tomader pokkhe kollyan tomra taha opekkha beshee jano-- ihaai 
tomader mushkil&quot;</p>
