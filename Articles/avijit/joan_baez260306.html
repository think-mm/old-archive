	Bangladesh, Bangladesh<br>
	When the sun sinks in the west<br>
	Die a million people of the Bangladesh ... (~Joan Baez)</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">It was a dreadful midnight 
	of 25th March, 1971. Most of the students of Iqbal Hall (one of the 
	allocated residence&nbsp; for the students of Dhaka University) were in sound 
	sleep. Some were taking preparation to go to bed after their 
	laborious daily routine work. All of a sudden, led by American supplied M-24 
	World War II tanks, &quot;the most civilized&quot; Pakistan Army&nbsp; cracked down on&nbsp; 
	those unarmed sleeping Bengali students of Dhaka University area. It's just 
	a beginning of the story. A melancholic prologue - a bloody preamble of the 
	most cruel genocidal epic&nbsp; in the world's history....</font></p>
	<p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#008000">&quot;..And the 
	students at the university<br>
	Asleep at night quite peacefully<br>
	The soldiers came and shot them in their beds<br>
	And terror took the dorm awakening shrieks of dread<br>
	And silent frozen forms and pillows drenched in red...&quot;&nbsp; (~Joan Baez)<br>
&nbsp;</font></b></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">Pakistani armed troops 
	took over the British Council Library and used it as fire base from which to 
	shell at the Iqbal Hall and its nearby dormitory areas. Since Iqbal Hall 
	was&nbsp; then known as the headquarters of the Free Bengal Students Action 
	Committee, a major portion of the Pakistani Army fury was directed at Iqbal 
	Hall. Just after midnight Iqbal Hall came under a barrage of heavy mortar 
	and machine-gun attack from near the pond in front and the police barracks 
	behind it. In plain words, Pak soldiers created a havoc at that night in 
	that area -&nbsp; they crucified, slaughtered the innocent students&nbsp; like 
	animals, killed indiscriminately&nbsp; to execute the systematic and planned 
	extermination of an entire national, racial, political, an ethnic 
	culture--the entire &quot;Bangalee Nation&quot;.</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#008000"><b>The story 
	of Bangladesh<br>

	Which flow out of the laws upon which nation stands<br>
	Which is to sacrifice a people for a land ... (Joan Baez)</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">On that eventful horrible 
	night, instantly at least 200 students were killed in Iqbal Hall. &quot;What 
	transpired around Iqbal Hall, I saw with my own eyes. Raging infernos 
	everywhere; the slum was burning, the cars parked around the residences were 
	burning. The heaped bodies of the dead from the slum were also set on fire 
	near the Nilkhet rail gate petrol pump. The sound of shells bursting and 
	guns firing, the smoke and fire, the smell of gun-powder and the stench of 
	the burning corpses all transformed the area into a fiery hell. Every so 
	often our building was being peppered with bullets. In the midst of this, 
	we, our families, the students and bearers from the Halls, the 
	slum-dwellers, had given up all hope for life, and were waiting for the hour 
	of death.&quot;, said Professor Rafiqul Islam of Dhaka University, who was 
	one of the 
	unfortunate witnesses of the cruel massacre of that night.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">Even after two days, 
	visitors still found scattered bodies smoldering in burnt-out rooms, others 
	were scattered outside, more floated in a nearby lake, an art student lay 
	sprawled across his easel. Though the civilized military tried to hide all 
	the facts&nbsp; from the outer world, many bodies were still there and could never 
	have accounted for all the blood in the corridors of Iqbal Hall.&nbsp; Mr. 
	Abul Kasem, one of our Mukto-Mona comrade 
	quotes in his article &quot;Reminiscing this bloody day after three decades&quot;-</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;... The scene I saw in 
		Iqbal Hall was beyond any description. The whole area was like a 
		battlefield. I knew that DUCSU VP Tofail Ahmed used to live there. There 
		were holes on the walls created by mortar shells. Those holes were 
		visible from afar. When I arrived at the playground of the hall, I saw 
		about 30 dead bodies all lined up for display to the public. Many of the 
		dead bodies were beyond any recognition due to innumerable bullet holes 
		on their faces. That was a gruesome sight. Many people started crying. 
		My friend Jafar used to live in Iqbal hall. I did not see his dead body. 
		Later, I learnt that his dead body was found in his bed. Needless to 
		say, the displayed corpses were merely a small fraction of the students 
		when Pak army had murdered in Iqbal Hall on that dreadful night.&quot;</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">... that night...blood, 
	flesh....dead bodies were scattered...everywhere. Crystal clear example of 
	homicide; Mass&nbsp; massacre.&nbsp; Burned faces, sign of torture on innocent

	...what a pain, agony and distress...what a mournful, grievous and

	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">This is just a part of 
	bloody Arabian night story, dear reader .. which led us a&nbsp; nine-month long 
	war of liberation ensued, culminating in the emergence of an independent 
	Bangladesh on 16 December 1971. The Liberation War was not , however, you 
	know- fought in the battlefield alone. Thousands of unarmed people including 
	women and children provided support to the Freedom Fighters - in running 
	errands, hiding or transporting arms and ammunition, providing shelter and 
	food, nursing the sick and the wounded and in myriad other ways.</font></p>

	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">During that time the 
	international media gave vivid and horrifying accounts that a systematic 
	genocide of Bangladesh was perpetrated by the Pakistan Army. Numerous books 
	and films have also documented the genocide. Many artists, performer and 
	singer around the world came for the support of Bangladesh. One of the 
	glorified names is <b>Joan Chandos Baez</b>, widely known as <b>Joan Baez</b> 
	in thousands of musical fans' hearts. This creative performer and peace 
	activist was born in Staten Island, New York, near the line of her Secondary 
	Transcendental, Neptune. Her album Joan Baez (1960) marked the beginning of 
	a successful recording career which included strong record sales in the 
	early '60s and devoted fans who followed her progress into the 1970s. At 
	that time Baez emerged at the forefront of the American roots revival, where 
	she introduced her audiences to the less prominent (at that time) Bob Dylan, 
	who in later years became a legendary figure in American music. Baez toured 
	with Bob Dylan in 1964 and 1965, 1975 and 1976 Rolling Thunder Revue tours, 
	and, abortively, in Europe in 1984 and performed renowned songs including, 
	<i>Blowing in the Wind</i> and <i>We shall overcome someday</i>.</font></p>

	<p align="center"><b>Picture :</b> Joan Baez with Bob Dylan, September 1963</p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">In 1971 Baez was just 30. 
	Having heard the news of the cruel massacre by Pakistani Na-Pak soldiers on 
	25th March, Joan felt so agitated and anguished for the unfortunate death of 
	the students of Dhaka University...that she took her guitar in hand and 
	stated to compose a new song, named - &quot;The Song of Bangladesh&quot;. [Some of the 
	invaluable lines (lyrics) of that song I have put in this article in 
	green color]. From that day, she started giving free performances and free 
	concerts for raising fund for Bangladesh with various anti-war 
	organizations. She started traveling many countries all over the world to 
	disclose the cruel genocide done by&nbsp; Pakistani soldiers in&nbsp; the world's 
	history.&nbsp; Her activities went on till we achieved our arduous freedom.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">This is Joan Baez - the 
	rewound singer and musician of 60's who felt for Bangali&nbsp; people, felt for 
	our beloved motherland . Besides her successful musical career, Baez applied 
	her &quot;creative imagination / and artistry&quot; (Neptune / Venus) towards the goal 
	of &quot;peace&quot; (Venus) in the 1960s, she established the Institute for the Study 
	of Nonviolence (1965) and became active in protests against the Vietnam War, 
	giving free performances for various anti-war organizations and peace 
	rallies. The acclaimed &quot;Peace Queen&quot; was jailed twice for participating 
	in &quot;anti-war&quot; (Venus) demonstrations, and in 1964 she refused to pay her 
	taxes. Her disagreement with the U.S. war in Vietnam forced her sending a letter to the Internal Revenue Service, 
	where Joan Baez wrote -</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial" color="#800080">&quot;<b>I do not believe in war. I do not 
	believe in the weapons of war ... and I am not going to volunteer 60% of my 
	year's income tax that goes to armaments.&quot;</b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">Later her disquiet at the 
	human rights violations of communist Vietnam also made her equally 
	increasingly critical of its government and therefore she composed&nbsp; some 
	publications in late 70s for four major U.S. newspapers, in which the 
	communists were accused for&nbsp; having created a nightmare to common 
	people. This experience ultimately led Baez to found her own human rights 
	group, <i>Humanitas International</i>, whose focus was to target oppression 
	wherever it occurred, criticizing right and left wing regimes equally.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font size="+0" face="Verdana">Till today Joan Baez 
	continues to speak and sing for peaceful solutions to violence in the Middle 
	East and Latin America. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="+0">Joan Baez. The 
	great ever-green freedom fighter of the history. She fought for Bangladesh,

	I listened&nbsp; the Song of Bangladesh for the very first time - I could not 
	hold my tears. I was really touched by the composition and its&nbsp; melancholic
