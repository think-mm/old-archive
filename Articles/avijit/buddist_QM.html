	<p><font face="Verdana">Dear M RS: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The author of the article you sent 
	made some seriously flawed assertions from scientific point of view. I'll 
	point out some of them. But before that I suggest- you please read last part 
	of my &quot;Alo-Hate choliyachey Adharer Jatree&quot; (in Bangla) carefully. Most of 
	the points author made I did discuss in that series article of mine. Here is

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have discussed the interesting 
	topic in a more detailed manner in the printed version. The book is expected 
	to be published next year at &quot;ekushe-boi mela&quot; (February Book Fair). I am 
	not sure if there are any other Bangla books at present in the market on 
	this topic. If I find any, I will let you know. There are some books by Dr. 
	Ali Asghar, Dr. M Akhtaruzzaman, but those are written from academic point 
	of view ignoring the essential philosophical discussion. Anyways, let me 
	point out just two erroneous assertions of the author briefly. The rest you 
	will find in the above link of my article. </font></p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The assumption is wrong. Atheism, by 
	definition, is the absence of belief in the existence of God(s); it has 
	nothing to do with beginning of universe, unlike the author's above 
	assertion. If we look at latest findings of astrophysics, the beginning of 
	the universe can be explained through the theological significance of 
	Inflationary Cosmology (which has been accepted by many renowned physicists 
	at this time) and it is as follows: it shows- how the universe might have 
	formed out of nothing, in complete chaos (maximum entropy), and have order 
	formed spontaneously without violating any known laws of physics. That is to 
	say- it provides an economical explanation about the origin of the universe 
	without creation or design hypothesis. A scientist does not investigate the 
	origin of universe to prove &quot;atheism&quot; or &quot;theism&quot;, rather he/she abides by 
	whatever conclusions the experimental data/observations lead him to. 
	Moreover, a Biblical God (as the author insisted quoting Biblical verse) is 
	not required by any contemporary scientific laws/data. The author, however, 
	while quoting a selective verse from Bible, entirely ignored that such 
	Biblical claims as &quot;the earth was created in just six days&quot;, and 
	then&nbsp; 
	&quot;the creation of sun and stars&quot;, are not supported by any scientific facts 
	or evidences [ In genesis, (1:3-5, 14-19) God creates light and separates 
	light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day. Yet he didn't 
	make the light producing objects such as the sun and the stars until the fourth 
	day (1:14-19). For more details:</font></p>

	http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/gen/1.html</a> ]&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me clarify more precisely. That 
	universe had a beginning through a Hot Big Bang has been supported by 
	current cosmological data, however, such &quot;beginning&quot; does not require any 
	&quot;God&quot;. We have no miraculous &quot;beginning&quot; to time or the universe that 
	requires &quot;God's intervention&quot;. It will take some space to discuss what 
	scientists mean by &quot;beginning&quot; since no absolute point in time exists in the 
	equations of physics of Big bang. If you want to proceed, I will, however, 
	discuss later. For now be assured that it is quite different from those 
	religious myths and paranormal hypothesis. </font></p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The author also states in his article: </font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font color="#008000"><span style="font-family: Arial">... 
				If we know the creation has a beginning, we are faced&nbsp; with 
				another logical question was the creation caused&nbsp; or was it 
				not caused? The Bible states, &quot;In the&nbsp; beginning God 
				created the heaven and the earth.&quot; Not&nbsp; only does the Bible 
				maintain that there was a cause -a&nbsp; creation-but it also 
				tells us what the cause was. It&nbsp; was God. The atheist tells 
				us that &quot;matter is&nbsp; self-existing and not created.&quot; If 
				matter had a&nbsp; beginning and yet was uncaused, one must 
				logically&nbsp; maintain that something would have had to come 
				into&nbsp; existence out of nothing. From empty space with no&nbsp; 
				force, no matter, no energy, and no intelligence,&nbsp; matter 
				would have to become existent. Even if this&nbsp; could happen 
				by some strange new process unknown to&nbsp; science today, 
				there is a logical problem. . . ... </span></font></td>

	</div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><font face="Verdana">The statement contains several flaws. First, the 
	author here is using the famous Kaläm Cosmological Argument, which is 
	normally stated as the following form: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><font face="Verdana">(1) Whatever begins has a cause. <br>
		(2) The universe began to exist. <br>
		(3) Therefore, the universe has a cause. <br>
		(4) The cause is God. </font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The first premise had been refuted 
	long time ago on the basis of the <i>non-causal nature of quantum phenomena</i>. 
	&quot;Whatever begins has a cause&quot; is not true for Quantum fluctuation. Physical 
	bodies begin to exist all the time without cause. In the radioactive decay 
	of an atomic nucleus, an alpha, beta, or gamma particle begins to exist 
	spontaneously, without a cause. So, Not everything that begins has to have a 
	cause. The uncertainty principle allows energy (which is equivalent to mass 
	by E=mc^2) to appear spontaneously as it disappears in a short-enough time. 
	It is a proven fact. These evidences are enough to refute author's claim.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Since the universe at the beginning 
	of the Big Bang was as tiny as a subatomic particle (at singularity point), 
	it could have been created with an uncaused quantum fluctuation that led to 
	inflation which afterwards proceeded through the appearance of matter and 
	structure. Edward Tryon was first to publish this idea in major journals in 
	1973. With appearance of the inflationary cosmology in 80s, several 
	physicists developed models in which inflation is triggered by an initial 
	quantum event. Here are some: David Atkatz and Heinz Pagels, &quot;Origin of 
	universe as Quantum Tunneling effect&quot; Physical review D25 (1982): 2065-73; 
	S.W. Hawking and I.G.Moss &quot;Supercolled Phase Transitions in the very early 
	Universe&quot;, Physics letters B110(1982):35-38; Alexander Vilenkin, &quot;Creation 
	of Universe from Nothing&quot; Physics letters 117B (1982) 25-28, Andre Linde, 
	&quot;Quantum creation of the inflamatory Universe,&quot; Letter Al Nuovo Cimento 
	39(1984): 401-405 etc. I am not asking you to read these technical papers 
	right now. However, they illustrate the point that serious attentions to the 
	possibility of an uncaused origin of the universe have been paid by quite a 
	big chunk of reputable physicists with results being published in major 
	scientific journals. If the concept of arising universe from out of nothing, 
	be such non-sense ,or unscientific, as alleged by the author of your 
	article, or if they violated any laws of physics, these papers would not 
	have been published in scientific journals. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Final objection to such argument is 
	that it finally concludes- a “God” exists; however, if it is so, same &quot;God&quot; 
	must have an origin (cause) using the rationale of the premise of such 
	argument. This leads to an infinite regress of causes (&quot;Gods&quot;) unacceptable 
	to the theist, so most believers take an exception to their &quot;God&quot; 
	hypothesis, saying that a &quot;God&quot; doesn’t need a cause. Problem is theists 
	cannot explain why this exception rule cannot be applied to the universe 
	itself. If a God “just is,” why can’t the universe “just be?”, as pointed 
	out by Philosopher B. Russel and D. Hume quite long time ago. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am a bit short of time at this 
	moment. I will respond to other portions of the argument later if needed. In 
	the mean time, in addition to my Bangla article, you might also want to look 
	at a particular chapter (Chapter 6: The Uncreated Universe) from Vic 
	Stenger's book named,&nbsp; <i>&quot;Has Science Found God? : The Latest Results 
	in the Search for Purpose in the Universe&quot;</i>&nbsp; in which he discussed 
	the issue somewhat more elaborately. Below is the link: </font></p>
