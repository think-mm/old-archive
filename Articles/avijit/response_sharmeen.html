<p><font color="#0000FF">Thanks again for mailing me again Sharmeen. Shubo 
Noboborsho to you. Let me tell my feelings once again.&nbsp; I dont think any 
one of us just &quot;wasting&quot; our time, instead we are both learning from each other.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said,</p>
<p><i>&quot;You can't define obscene but it's not relative either, nothing is 
relative for that matter, there has to be a line, for example,...&quot;</i></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">I disagree with you when you say &quot;it's not relative&quot;. 
However I will discuss this&nbsp; later. Let me ponder on with some other 
arguments.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said,</p>
<p><i>&quot;Bangladesh has it's own<b> cultural and religious values</b> and we 
should try to preserve it, not &quot;improving&quot; it by borrowing stuff from other 
culture that doesn't go with us. Here in America, parents don't mind taking 
their children to the beach with scanty swimsuit, babies as young as 2yrs have 
their play-date, they don't mind it coz that's how they grew up, that's what 
their culture...&quot;</i></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">What is culture? Culture can be defined as the general 
characteristic of a community. The community is made of the individuals. 
Individuals have values and act according to those values. Those vales are often 
given to them at their childhood in their families. Values drive from beliefs. 
If my beliefs subconsciously make me a misogynist, it is very probable that I 
will end up as a woman hater and abuser. </font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">You seem to have very negative stereotyping attitude 
towards the culture of west while you say that parents don't mind taking their 
children to the beach with scanty swimsuit, babies as young as 2yrs have their 
play-date, etc etc. Let's for sake of argument agree that west sucks.&nbsp; 
Then, what values religious culture gives to its followers in our countries? How 
it is better than west? Our culture allows bribing, cheating, deceiving, or 
beating our wives, Bangladesh already made Hattric in corruption. Where is our 
&quot;cultural values&quot; if we are so moral compared to west? And for religious values, 
perhaps you know that abuse in those theocratic states&nbsp; towards the women 
is far more than the abuse of women in the West. One example of that is honor 
killing. In many Islamic countries honor killing is not a bad thing at all. In 
fact the killers regain their honor by killing a female member of their own 
family. Often these victims have done nothing wrong. They have been raped 
forcefully and now they have to be killed by their own brothers or fathers. In 
Jordan a brother killed his own sister after another brother had raped her. In 
india because of &quot;hindu culture&quot; thousands of widows were once burned, still 
cast problem there is a major issue, Joutuk protha, Pon Protha all can still 
play in the society because of so-called &quot;religious values&quot;.&nbsp; Therefore 
there can be no denial that religion has an important effect on our culture, 
that it shapes our individual as well as our collective behavior. But the 
question is how good are they?</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">We have brought up in such a &quot;great&quot; religious culture, 
that bribing, cheating, child-marriage, multiple wives, wife-beating, 
honor-killing is not considered as sin, whereas wearing &quot;scanty swimsuit&quot;,&nbsp; 
or dating etc does. How logical it is? If someone wear swimsuit or kisses his 
girlfriend in the beach or even practice homosexuality in his personal life, 
does not virtually harm you, does it? He/she has every right to practice 
whatever he/she things right unless it physically harms you. This is the golden 
rule. </font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Unfortunately we have not brought up in a culture where 
The term freedom of speech can be exercised.&nbsp; The purpose of freedom of 
speech is to allow everyone to express their views without being persecuted or 
lose their lives over it. In fact the freedom of speech is to avoid that evil 
that you are referring to, that where this freedom does not exist takes roots. 
When a group assumes to have the absolute truth, it abolishes the freedom of 
speech because it assumes that there is nothing that anyone else could teach 
them. It is because they feel threatened by opposition and want to eliminate it. 
Where every one is free to express his views, different ideas collide and from 
this collision the spark of the truth is kindred.</font></p>
<p><i>You said,</i></p>
<p><i>if women would choose their outfit more carefully, you just can't 
tantalize an ignorant hooligan and then say... hey I'm like ur sis or mom, show 
some respect dude!!!! that's pathetic!!!! </i></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">This again shows how great our &quot;religious culture&quot;. 
It's kind a &quot;women raped, women blamed&quot; stuff. And you are advocating this even 
being an women! If &quot;choose outfit&quot; is the main issue then why not the women is 
Singapore gets raped who wears skirts, bikinis, shorts even in late nights? Did&nbsp; 
they come from outer planet? No, only thing is that they exercise human rights 
and freedom of speech which is absent in our so-glorified culture.&nbsp; Even 
though they dates months after moths before marriage, wears swimming suits in 
sea beach, or drink alcohol or wine, crime rate in Singapore is less. They do 
not steal other peoples' property or cheat others which is very common in our 
country. Not that Singapore people are very religious. In fact totally opposite. 
Most of them do not follow any religion. What they do is that they follow a 
golden rule -&nbsp; One should do what he says and say what he does in social 
relations. Otherwise common understanding is not possible. Hence morality is a 
social necessity and not a passport to heaven. As promoters of religious culture 
do not understand the social significance of morality, all kind of ignorance and 
human rights violations have prevailed in theistic civilization, despite ages of 
belief in god. </font></p>
<p>You said,</p>
<p><i>Anyways, I'm sure it was a waste of words and time as bangladesh is going 
to be a huge mess of confused people with nothing to hang on to as everything is 
going to be relative anyways. With no one to show them what's right, what's 
wrong, how far is too far and where to draw the line.</i></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">I am not sure whether your angry response was being 
targeted towards me! If its really waste of time, this will certainly be my last 
response.&nbsp; I did not wanted to make you irritated, rather just to raise 
some alternative points which our &quot;culture&quot; do not allow. The style of the 
writing of a person is his or her own business. The point is that anyone must be 
free to write whatever he wishes. Compose any style of music, paint in any 
color, form or theme. This is freedom. You are also free not to buy his books, 
music or paintings if you dislike them. But you cannot prohibit another person 
to express himself the way he or she wishes or suppress his message nor deprive 
me from listening to the message that I like. If you allow yourself such 
prerogative, then I should do the same. There is no confusion here. One should 
remove his/her own confusion first before pointing to others. Now lets go to the 
topic which I thought that I would discuss later.</font></p>
<p><i>You said</i></p>
<p><i>You see my point? Hence all these ratings, pg-13 or or R as in movies. 
And, that's why everything is catagorized as classic, comedy, or plain porno, 
otherwise it would be under one name and that is &quot; motion picture or movies&quot;.
</i></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Only here I seem to agree with you. I did not mean in 
my write-up that a school going kid would read porno martial. Yes there should 
be some restrictions for them. Even &quot;perverted&quot; west do follow this. But again, 
You are also free not to buy his books, music or paintings if you dislike them 
or find detrimental to your younger sister. But you cannot prohibit another 
person to express himself the way he or she wishes or suppress his message nor 
deprive me from listening to the message that I like.</font></p>
