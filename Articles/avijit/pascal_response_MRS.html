<p>Your purpose is OK, and conclusion may also be valid, however I think the
method you applied&nbsp; to calculate the probability is not entirely correct. I
will explain it later why.&nbsp; It is obviously not to disappoint you; i hope
our discussion will make the analysis interesting and fruitful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, before arguing to seek proof from &quot;either side&quot; we must be
careful to understand to whom &quot;BURDEN PROOF&quot; resides. For me, it's
more logical to say,&nbsp; if someone believe that the god exists, it is him who
should bring the proof, cause, it is his duty to establish his concept, not vise versa.
The burden of proof is always resides on the person making an extraordinary
assertion or proposition (for e.g existence of god, Unicorn, Zeus, Kali, Bromma,
angel, Santa Clause, devil, alien etc.). It is a fallacy to push the burden of
proof on the person who denies or questions such an assertion. What do you
think?</p>

<p>No exactly. Coin and dice are real physical entity. We can see it, can check
it. For e.g, a coin has two sides. So, probability of get either side by
flipping a perfect coin is exactly 1/2.&nbsp; For the dice the probability 1/6,
as it has six sides. But we do not know the property of God, just like we do not
know the property of soul, unicorn, ghost, fairy etc. But will be fair to say
there is 50% chance that unicorn (or Ponkhiraj ghora) exists? If not then why
for God? Probability does not work in this way scientifically.&nbsp; let me give
you a basic meaning what probability means mathematically.&nbsp;</p>
In general, probability of an event occurring is given by: = (number of desired
outcome) / (total number of outcomes possible)
<p>Suppose we have a box which contains four balls, colored red [R], blue [B],
green [G], and yellow [Y].</p>
<p>If we draw two balls at random from the box, what is the chance that one is
yellow and the other red ? i.e [YR]</p>
<p>To solve this problem you have&nbsp; to do is to make a list of the possible
outcomes of a draw, such as :</p>
<p>[YR, GY, RB, GB, YB, GR]</p>
<p>here, number of desired outcome = 1</p>
<p>and total number of possible outcome =6</p>
<p>So probability here = 1/6. You cannot carry on this in case of God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> But in God's existence (or non-existence) case,&nbsp;<br>
> somebody can also assume it as 40-60 or 60-40 etc. Its just a guess based on&nbsp;<br>
> NO prior info. To be fair, I have assumed it as 50-50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>well,&nbsp; I think we need to specify what kind of information we are
seeking. If God is considered &quot;just&quot; as the creator of universe and
responsible for the formation of life, there are ample of evidences that
scientists can explain from evolutionary point of view. That's why most of the
scientists who were creationists (and religious) are convinced to accept
evolution as a fact by observing those evidences,&nbsp; and overwhelming
majorities are now evolutionists. In fact we can safely say, that there are
hundreds of evidences that evolution had happened, whereas there is NOT a single
solid evidences/proof in favor of creationism other than blind faith.&nbsp;
Anybody can still claim that there are 50-50 chance that God created life with
his own mechanism and evolution did not happen, but I dont think the probability
is as high as 50% though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again survey on recent scientists reveal that we&nbsp; have 72.2% of
scientists that are atheist. 20.8% of scientists that are agnostic. Biologists
had the lowest rate of belief at 5.5% and mathematicians had the highest rate of
belief at 14.3%. (check : <a href="http://www.physicsforums.com/archive/t-24879_Leading_Scientists_Reject_God.html">http://www.physicsforums.com/archive/t-24879_Leading_Scientists_Reject_God.html</a>
and <a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html">http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/news/file002.html</a>
). I am, BTW&nbsp; not suggesting that 72% chance is that there is no God, what
I am pointing that about 200 years ago most of the scientists believed in God,
whereas now most of them are pretty convinced&nbsp; that natural laws and
natural phenomena is sufficient to explain the ultimate mystery, no need to
invoke a supernatural deity. If someone pursue for such entity, it is he who
will carry the burden of proof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I gave the above example to point out that there are many events whose
possible outcome may be 2, but probability may not be 50% (i.e. 1/2).&nbsp; Lottery
is one, even though there is two outcome- either you win, or not. Again, if
someone asks you what is the probability that our earth will be destroyed
tomorrow? Do you think it is 50% ( either it will be destroyed or not)? What is
the probability that I may die tomorrow? Here is also two outcome - either I
die, or not. Do you think the probability is 1/2 ? I don't think so. :-)</p>
<p>Strict atheists may insist on the rationality of a probability assignment of
0, as Oppy 1990 among others points out. For example, they may contend that
reason alone can settle that God does not exist, perhaps by arguing that the
very notion of an omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent being is contradictory.
I have pointed some contradiction in one of my article :</p>
<p><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/nastikota_astikota_re.pdf">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/nastikota_astikota_re.pdf</a></p>

<p>Many of them might consider existence of God is a very low-probable event
just as the existence of Unicorn. We just do not know. Again, you cannot rule
out the possibility of having multiple God either (how do you know there is only
one God?). The situation will be indeed more complex this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>let me give you some examples to understand how expectation value works.
Suppose in a casino in Genting Island&nbsp; you have the option of paying a
dollar to play a game in which there is an equal chance of returning nothing,
and returning three dollars. The expectation of the game itself is</p>
<blockquote>
  0*(1/2) + 3*(1/2) = 1.5,
</blockquote>
so the expectation of paying a dollar (-1)&nbsp; for certain, then playing, is
<blockquote>
  -1 + 1.5 = 0.5.
</blockquote>
This exceeds the expectation of not playing (namely 0), so you should play. 
<p>On the other hand, if the game gave an equal chance of returning nothing, and
returning two dollars, then its expectation would be:</p>
<blockquote>
  0*(1/2) + 2*(1/2) = 1.
</blockquote>
Then consistent with decision theory, you could either pay the dollar to play,
or refuse to play, for either way your overall expectation would be -1+1 = 0.
<p>Pascal considered f as a heavenly reward = infinity. </p>
<blockquote>

      <tr vAlign="top">
        <td align="left">&nbsp;</td>

      </tr>
      <tr vAlign="top">

        <td align="middle">f<sub>1 (finite value)</sub></td>
      </tr>
      <tr vAlign="top">
        <td align="left"><strong><em>Wager against God</em></strong></td>
        <td align="middle">f<sub>2 (finitevalue)</sub></td>
        <td align="middle">f<sub>3 (finite value)</sub></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E(wager for God) = &#8734;*p + f<sub>1</sub>*(1 &#8722; p) = &#8734;</p>
That is, your expected utility of belief in God is infinite — as Pascal puts
it, &quot;our proposition is of infinite force&quot;. 
<p>On the other hand, your expected utility of wagering against God is</p>
<blockquote>
  E(wager against God) = f<sub>2</sub>*p + f<sub>3</sub>*(1 &#8722; p)
</blockquote>
<p>This is finite. Rationality requires you to perform the act of maximum
expected utility. Therefore, rationality requires you to wager for God. This is
what Pascal concluded. </p>
