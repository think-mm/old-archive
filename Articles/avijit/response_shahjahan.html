<title>Dear Mr</title>

<body>

<p>Dear Mr. Shajahan:</p>
<p>This is the third time you sent your scribble to my account. I wonder why you 
are sending to me. My artcile(s) have been published in JaiJaiDin. You could 
have sent it there, or they denied to publish it in that magazine? If so, you 
may&nbsp; check your writing style especially they way you committed &quot;ad hominem&quot; 
falacies throughout your writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I glanced your first write-up that you sent to my account, which 
appears to me written from a typical apologetic mindset. I may be wrong, however 
when you said you knew the evidences of &quot;nogno Deb-Debi&quot;, but no &quot;oshlilota&quot; in 
Islam, it reveals your typical mind set. Perhaps you do not know, that your 
prophet's&nbsp; <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/SKM/zeinab.htm">
lust for sex</a>, his affairs with
<a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina/mariyah.htm">his maids</a> 
and <a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina/safiyah.htm">slave girls</a>, 
his pedophilic relationship at age 54 with
<a href="http://www.faithfreedom.org/Articles/sina/ayesha.htm">Aisha, </a>a 
9-year-old child, or his
<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/071.sbt.html#007.071.660">
hallucinations</a> or daydreams&nbsp; of having imaginary sex with his wives 
clearly destroys your argument. Please check the links I provided and also do 
not forget about Mutaa mariage and Hila marriage, which reside in Islam from its 
ancient period. Please do not think I am attacking Islam or writing having any 
hatered. I stated facts.&nbsp; In my writeup I wrote both on Hindu purans as 
well as Moksodul Momenin (I did not say a word abou Quran or Hadith though), 
whereas you only saw obscenity in Hinduism, but Islam remains pure to you. 
That's why I said your mindset was typical, though you attributed your own 
write-up as &quot;insightful&quot;!</p>
<p>You just abandoned Richard Dawkin's scientific theory by attributing &quot;Bhin-deshi&quot; 
biggani. I am afraid you do not know the definition of science. Scientific truth 
does not depend on whether someone is shodeshi or Bideshi. 2+2 =4, or 
pythagorus's theorum remains same whether you reside in USA or Bangladesh. Is it 
not pragmatic to read his books or know his theories first then refute? It seems 
you have not done so. </p>
<p>You talked a lot about sex harassment occurred in the west in ur writeup. 
Before making any conclusion, we need to know why sex harassments occur in the 
first place. Male chauvinistic ego, sexual superiority&nbsp; complex, thinking 
women as commodity, frustration among young generation, mental sickness and 
disorder, law and order situation and many other things are involved. Not all 
the things can be handled by proper sex education, however some can. </p>
<p>True,&nbsp; there are incidents on child molestation, rape case etc in US, however 
normally people do not get afraid to report against those crimes. &quot;Raper kotha 
janle meyer aar biye hobe na&quot; - such situation never arises in such 
countries compared to ours. Each and every 
country has its own problem. America is a capitalist country. Many scholars think rape 
molestation etc are an integral part of the capitalist system where Profits over people, 
viewing women just as commodities, aggression 
rather than compassion, and establishing control are the main tenets of the 
system. Of course capitalist society has some advantages which freedom 
loving US people enjoys;&nbsp; however, compared to socialist countries, women 
oppression, rape, molestation etc are high due to the very reason they created 
for themselves. The issue needs a socio-political explanation which will take 
time and space. we can discuss this some other time.</p>
<p>Statistics of rape incidents in one particular country does not invalidate the 
necessity of sex-education either.&nbsp; I have seen one statistics where it 
claimed that most of the road accidents occurs due to some other reason, not due 
to driver's alertness or abiding rules. But does this simple statistics nullify 
the necessity of&nbsp; being alert and abiding rules while driving? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>Now two questions for you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) In the Victorian Era, English ladies hardly showed their flesh to 
strangers. They even wore gloves to hid their fingers from their view. Today, 
English ladies use much less fabrics than men to cover their bodies. Does this 
mean that the English ladies have become indecent these days? Are English men 
taking advantage of them? What about those women we see on beaches and around 
swimming pools in bikinis? Do they get harassed or raped for what they wear? </p>
<p>2) In the African continents, there are tribes whose women do not cover the 
upper part of their bodies. In the jungle of Amazon, there live some tribes 
whose women do not wear any cloth. Despite moving around with their tops 
uncovered or without any cloth on their bodies, men do not rape their half 
dressed or fully naked women. This is due to the reason that &quot;decency&quot; carries a 
different meaning for those so-called uncivilized people.&nbsp; Interestingly 
those tribal girls use to get afraid to come our &quot;civilized&quot; world for being 
afraid of molestation. Would you kindly explain what restricts the tribal guys 
to molest their half-naked ladies, where you guys cannot do?</p>
<p>Lastly, I hope you will send your write-up (or whatever it is) directly to 
JaiJaiDin from now on, not to my or other reader's personal account. I know you 
are very critical about west. However, I do not find anything wrong to learn 
some basic &quot;decency&quot; which I presume is absent in Arab desert, perhaps?</p>
