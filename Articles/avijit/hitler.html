<p>I found some&nbsp; self proclaimed &quot;patriot writers&quot; in NFB was trying to 
deny the influence of Christianity on Hitler's life. They probably do not know 
that Hitler indeed was a devout believer and believed in Christianity or they 
are acting like those Holocaust Denials. Whatever the reason may be, I here 
wish to provide few evidences from authentic sources. Lets start quoting first what Hitler 
said about himself:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his 
	own denomination, of making <b><i>people stop just talking superficially of 
	God's will, and actually fulfil God's will, and not let God's word be 
	desecrated.</i></b></p>
	<p>For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their abilities. 
	Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation, the 
	divine will. Therefore, let every man be active, each in his own 
	denomination if you please, and let every man take it as his first and most 
	sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps 
	outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the 
	other.</p>
	<p>[...]</p>
	<p>Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the 
	Almighty Creator: <b><i>by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting 
	for the work of the Lord.</i></b> &quot;</p>
	<div class="citation" align="right">
		[Adolf Hitler, from &quot;<cite>Mein Kampf</cite>&quot;, translation by Ralph 
		Mannheim.]</div>
</blockquote>
<p>BTW, for those who does not know, Mein Kampf is actually the written words of Adolf 
Hitler. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>So, It is quite clear from his own statement that Hitler was not only 
	believed in God, but also wanted to&nbsp; justify his fight for the German 
	people and against Jews by using Godly and Biblical reasoning :</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>&quot;Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will 
		of the Almighty Creator: <i>by defending myself against the Jew, I am 
		fighting for the work of the Lord</i>.&quot;</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also many evidences (refer to Hitler's own speeches, proclamations, 
biography, books etc) that proves that Hitler was deeply influenced by Martin 
Luther infamous book &quot;<a href="http://www.nobeliefs.com/luther.htm">On the Jews 
and their Lies</a>,&quot; where Luthar spread profound hatred for Jews and their 
Jewish religion. Many historians and scholars opined that Hitler's Nazi plan to 
create a German Reich Church laid its bases on the &quot;Spirit of Martin 
Luther.&quot; </p>
<p>Hitler certainly many times appeared publicly as a theist, and claimed to be 
a Christian. Here is another evidence:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The Führer made it known to those entrusted with the Final Solution that 
	the killings should be done as humanely as possible. This was in line with 
	his conviction that he was observing God's injunction to cleanse the world 
	of vermin. Still a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite 
	detestation of its hierarchy (&quot;<u>I am now as before a Catholic and will 
	always remain so</u>&quot; [quoting Hitler]), he carried within him its teaching 
	that the Jew was the killer of God. The extermination, therefore, could be 
	done without a twinge of conscience since he was merely acting as the 
	avenging hand of God -- so long as it was done impersonally, without 
	cruelty.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;I am now as before a Catholic...&quot; quotation from Hitler was recorded in 
the diary of Gerhard Engel, an SS Adjutant, in October 1941. What has the 
writers who deny the influence of Christianity on Hitler&nbsp; to say about it? 
Perhaps Hitler was lying, right? </p>
<p>Again, Adolf Hitler, in a speech delivered April 12, 1922, uttered [published 
in &quot;<cite>My New Order</cite>&quot;]:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. 
	It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few 
	followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to 
	fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but 
	as a fighter.</p>
	<p>In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage 
	which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge 
	to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was 
	his fight against the Jewish poison.</p>
	<p>Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more 
	profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to 
	shed his blood upon the Cross.</p>
	<p>As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have 
	the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice...</p>
	<p>And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting 
	rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also 
	a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work and 
	work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only for their 
	wages wretchedness and misery.</p>
	<p>When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues 
	and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, 
	but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord 
	two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people 
	are plundered and exploited&quot;<br>

		[Quoted in &quot;<cite><a href="http://www.infidels.org/news/atheism/media.html#fttoday">Freethought 
		Today</a></cite>&quot; April 1990.]<p align="left">Indeed,&nbsp; &quot;My feeling 
		as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. ...&quot;&nbsp; 
		or &quot;In boundless love as a Christian and as a man&quot; or, &quot;As a Christian I 
		have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, ..&quot; (etc.) such kind of 
		statements clearly depict Hitler's deep faith in Christianity, no matter 
		what some religious-apologists thinks about it today. It is true that in 
		later stage of life, while Hitler had gained more power and start 
		threatening the west and also being threatened, he began to see 
		Christianity as a threat to the National Socialists' domination of 
		Germany. After 1935 his speeches and writings became more and more 
		virulently anti-Christian; he argued that Christian worship was a sign 
		of weakness. Same strategy was taken by Saddam Hussein in our age.&nbsp; 
		While he waged war against Iran and Quiet few decades ago he said it was 
		a secular progressive war against Islamic fundamentalism, but later 
		while he was attacked by western Kaffirs, he shifted his position to 
		stay under &quot;Islamic Umbrella&quot; and became a &quot;true Islamic leader&quot;.&nbsp; But does it prove anything other 
		than cheap political poly of Saddam, even though most gullible faithfuls were 
		being fooled? Anyway, readers might want to see the following link for 
		details to know about Hitler's Christianity :

		books on the topic written by Ralph Manheim, Scholder and others
