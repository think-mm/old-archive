  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
  When will be <i>the Keyamot</i></font></b><font size="4"><b>?</b></font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">The one all-encompassing theme of the Qur'an 
  is the inevitability of Judgment Day/Kiyamat/Doomsday. Muslims believe that 
  this world, created by Allah, will eventually be brought to an end by Him, and 
  that it will be followed by a new world (so called &quot;Roj Hashorer Moydan&quot;) in 
  which all people will be resurrected and brought to account for their deeds. 
  The precise timing of the end of the world is known only to Allah; not even 
  any of the prophets sent by Allah, nor any of the angels closest to Him, know 
  when it is to occur.&nbsp; I cite an verse from Quran :</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">&quot;They ask you about the hour, when will be 
    its taking place? Say: The knowledge of it is only with my Lord; none but He 
    shall manifest it at its time; it will be momentous in the heavens and the 
    earth; it will not come on you but of a sudden. They ask you as if you were 
    solicitous about it. Say: Its knowledge is only with Allah, but most people 
    do not know.&quot; [Qur’an,
    <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/007.qmt.html#007.187">7:187</a>]</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">Also from another verse which tells us that 
  Kiyamat will come all on a sudden: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">Nay, it shall come on them all of a sudden 
    and cause them to become confounded, so they shall not have the power to 
    avert it, nor shall they be respited. [Qur'an,
    <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/021.qmt.html#021.040">021.040</a>]</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">It is said an angel named Israfil&nbsp; is 
  standing -only Allah knows where- with a trumpet in his hand. When he will 
  blow the trumpet at the command of Allah the great cataclysm ('Kiamat'-Doomsday) 
  will occur. And when he will blow it again at the command of Allah the plains 
  of 'Hashar' etc. will be recreated.&nbsp; Our Great Guru Aroj Ali Matubbar 
  uttered in his book, Shotter Shondan: </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="4">In the beginning the universe was 
    created simply by order of Allah. Why then can't it be destroyed only by His 
    order? What need is there for Israfil to blow his trumpet? Then again the 
    command of Allah was enough for the creation of the universe on the first 
    occasion but after the great cataclysm a second blowing of the trumpet would 
    be necessary for the recreation of the plains of Hashar etc. Why ? and what 
    for? We hear that angel Israfil has been standing erect with the trumpet in 
    his&nbsp; hand from time immemorial and will remain in that position till 
    Doomsday. Yet during this incalculable time he will blow the trumpet only 
    twice. Does not Allah know the exact date of Doomsday? If He does what is 
    the point in keeping Israfil standing there for such an eternity?</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
  What will be destroyed and what will be not:</font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">It is mentioned earlier that when angel 
  israfil will blow his trumpet at the command of allah, the almighty, there 
  will be a total cataclysm in which the entire universe will disappear. With 
  the single exception of Allah, everything including Israfil, the trumpet 
  blower will loose its existence.&nbsp; <b>Forty days </b>(in another opinion 
  forty years) after this, Allah will recreate Israfil to blow the trumpet once 
  again as a result of which the world and all its animals will be resurrected . 
  Aroj Ali Matubbar said, </font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="4">&quot; Immediately after the cataclysm (Kiyamat) 
    there will be no sun nor any light transmitting object. How then will forty 
    days or forty years be counted during the interval between this disastrous 
    event and the resurrection?</font></i></p>
    <p align="justify"><i><font size="4">Besides, will there be night, too, with 
    those days? if there be what will they be like without the sun? And if there 
    be no nights with the days how will the number of those uninterrupted 
    prolonged days be forty?&quot;</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">However from a different version of Islamic 
  story,&nbsp; 8 things will somehow be able to survive from Allah's cataclysm:</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">1) Allah and his throne<br>
  2) Kursi (!!)<br>
  3) Laoh (???)<br>
  4) Pen<br>
  5) Heaven<br>
  6) Hell<br>
  7) Trumpet<br>
  8) Soul</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">Currently I have no authentic sources 
  (verses from Koran and Hadith) in hand&nbsp; to verify the above claim.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
  Signs of Keyamot:</font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">Although we have been repeatedly told that 
  none in the world knows when exactly the world is going to end, Allah and the 
  Prophet&nbsp; also have told us of some of the signs which indicate that the 
  Hour is approaching, drawing nearer. </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">In the Gabriel Hadith, wherein the angel 
  Gabriel took on the form of a man with extremely dark hair and extremely white 
  clothing, and then came and asked the Prophet&nbsp; about the levels of the 
  religion (Islam, Iman and Ihsan), he asked after that, &quot;Tell me about the 
  Hour.&quot; The Prophet (may Allah bless him and his Household and grant them 
  peace) replied, &quot;The questioned one is not more knowledgeable about it than 
  the questioner,&quot; whereupon Gabriel (peace be upon him) said, &quot;Then tell me 
  about its signs.&quot; He replied, &quot;<b>That the slave girl shall give birth to her 
  mistress, and that you see barefoot, naked, poor shepherds building tall 
  buildings.</b>&quot; [Shahi Muslim]</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">So, there are certain events and signs which 
  will occur on the earth prior to it. These signs are categorized into two :</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4"><b>Minor sign </b>(Alamot-e Chugra)<br>
  <b>Major sign</b> (Alamot-e Kubra)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">The minor signs are those which start 
  occurring well before the Day of Judgement, and which in themselves are not 
  strikingly extraordinary. It starts from the day of Prophet's death to 
  appearance of Imam Mahdi (some time in future)</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">The major signs are those which will occur 
  closer to the Day of Judgment, and they are bizarre and remarkable. It starts 
  from the day of arrival of Imam Mahadi&nbsp; and will end when Israfil will 
  blow his trumpet. Quran says that at the Day of Judgment, the heaven is split 
  asunder (Q.84:1) and it will heave with (awful) heaving (Q.52:9), the sun is 
  overthrown (Q.81:1), the Earth is shaken with her (final) earthquake (Q. 
  99:1), the moon is eclipsed (Q.75:8) and “the angel Israfil will sound the 
  trumpet and all living creatures, mankind, angels and jinn then living, will 
  die. Another blast and all will be raised to life. Allah's throne will appear 
  in the clouds, carried by 8 angels. Believers will receive a book of their 
  deeds in their right hand, and unbelievers in their left hand. The books will 
  be opened and men's works weighed on scales (mizan). In fear, men will look 
  for someone to plead with Allah. They will go to Adam, Abraham, Moses and 
  Jesus, but find no help. At last they will turn to Muhammad”</font></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">
  Some Hadith Regarding the sign of Keyamot:</font></b></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">Narrated Anas: &quot;I will narrate to you a 
  Hadith I heard from Allah's Apostle and none other than I will tell you of it. 
  I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'From among the portents of the Hour are the 
  following: <b>Religious knowledge will be taken away</b>; <b>General ignorance 
  (in religious matters) will increase</b>; <b>illegal Sexual intercourse will 
  prevail</b>: <b>Drinking of alcoholic drinks will prevail</b>. <b>Men will 
  decrease in number, and women will increase in number</b>, <b>so much so that 
  fifty women will be looked after by one man</b>.' (Translation of Sahih 
  Bukhari, Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah), Volume 7, Book 62, Number 158)&quot; <br>
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">Narrated Abu Huraira: &quot;The Prophet said, 
  'The Hour (Last Day) will not be established until (religious) <b>knowledge 
  will be taken away</b> (by the death of religious learned men), <b>earthquakes 
  will be very frequent</b>, <b>time will pass quickly</b>,<b> afflictions will 
  appear</b>, <b>murders will increase and money will overflow amongst you</b>.' 
  (Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Invoking Allah for Rain (Istisqaa), Volume 2, 
  Book 17, Number 146)&quot; <br>
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">Narrated Abu Huraira: &quot;The Prophet said, 
  'The Hour will not be established till you fight with <b>people wearing shoes 
  made of hair</b>. And the Hour will not be established till you fight with <b>
  people whose faces look like shields coated with leather</b>.' (Abu Huraira 
  added, 'They will be) small-eyed, flat nosed, and their faces will look like 
  shields coated with leather.') (Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Fighting for the 
  Cause of Allah (Jihaad), Volume 4, Book 52, Number 180)&quot; <br>
  <br>
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">Narrated Abu Huraira: &quot;The Prophet said, 
  'The Hour will not be established till <b>there is a war between two groups</b> 
  among whom there will be a great number of casualties, though the claims (or 
  religion) of both of them will be one and the same. And the Hour will not be 
  established till there appear about <b>thirty liars, all of whom will be 
  claiming to be the messengers of Allah</b>.' (Translation of Sahih Bukhari, 
  Virtues and Merits of the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions, Volume 4, Book 
  56, Number 806)&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Narrated Abu Huraira: &quot;Allah's Apostle said, 'The Hour will not be established 
  till two (huge) groups fight against each other, their claim (i.e, religion) 
  being one and the same.' (Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Dealing with 
  Apostates, Volume 9, Book 84, Number 69)&quot; <br>
  <br>
  </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font size="4">Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may 
  peace be upon him) as saying: &quot;The Last Hour will not come till wealth is 
  abundant and overflowing, so much so that the owner of the property will think 
  as to who will accept Sadaqa from him, and a person would be called to accept 
  Sadaqa and he would say: I do not need it. (Translation of Sahih Muslim, The 
  Book of Zakat (Kitab Al-Zakat), Book 005, Number 2209)&quot; <br>

    <p align="justify"><font size="4">Al-Mahdi, whom the muslim community

  <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Dajjal will appear and will be killed by 
  Jesus:</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">A lengthy hadith narrated by Ibn Majah, 
    Ibn Khuzaimah, and ad-Dhiyaa’, attributed to Abu Umamah, reports that the 
    Prophet of Allah, said, <br>
    <br>
    “There will be three hard years before the Dajjal (appears). During them, 
    people will be stricken by a great famine. In the first year, Allah will 
    command the sky to withhold a third of its rain, and the earth to withhold a 
    third a third of its produce. In the second year, Allah will command the sky 
    to withhold two thirds of its rain, and the earth to withhold two thirds of 
    its produce. In the third year, Allah will command the sky to withhold all 
    of its rain, and it will not rain a single drop of rain. He will command the 
    earth to withhold all of its produce, and no plant will grow. All hoofed 
    animals will perish, except that which Allah wills.” He (sallallahu `alaihi 
    wa sallam) was asked, ‘What sustains people during that time?’ He said, 
    “Tahlil, takbir and tahmid (Saying, la ilaha ill Allah, Allahu Akbar and al-hamdulillah). 
    This will sustain them just as food does.” [Sahih Al-Jami` as-Saghir, no. 
    7875] </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">Dajjal is considered as the embodiment of 
    evil. He will kill a lot of muslims. Dajjal will be blind in the right eye. 
    He will have thick hair on his body and he will also have Paradise and Hell 
    with him. Though his Paradise will appear as Jannah, in reality it will be 
    Hell, and likewise, though his Hell will appear like Jahannnam, in reality 
    it will be Paradise.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">He will remain on the Earth for a period 
    of forty days, of which the first day will be as long as a year, the second 
    day as long as a month, the third as a week and the rest will be normal in 
    length. He will try to gain entry to the two holy cities Makkah and Madinah, 
    but the angels who guard them will bar him from them. From there, he will 
    flee to Syria, where he will meet resistance from the forces of Imam Mahdi, 
    the leader of the then Muslim community. Then shall the battle between Good 
    and Evil begin in earnest.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">As was narrated in the Hadith by An-Nawwas 
    bin Sam`an, the Dajjal will be killed at the hand of Jesus son of Mary.</font></p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">The rising of the sun from the west:</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">The rising of the sun from the west is 
    also a major sign of Keyamot proven by the Qur'an and Sunnah. Allah says in 
    the Qur'an, &quot;The day when some signs of your Lord will come, no good will it 
    do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good 
    (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith.&quot; (Surah Al-An'aam)</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">The verse is referring to the rising of 
    the sun from the west, as is the opinion of the majority of the 
    commentators. (Tabari/Ibne Kathir) Imam Tabari, after mentioning the 
    different opinions of the commentators writes, &quot;The most correct opinion in 
    regards to the meaning of this verse is that what is apparent from the 
    reports narrated from the Prophet that he said, &quot;(lmaan will be of no 
    benefit) when the sun rises from the west.&quot; (Tabari)</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4"><br>

  <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">The emergence of the Beast from the 
  Earth:</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">The Beast named <i>Dabbatul Arad</i> is 
    also a major sign of Keyamot. Allah says in the Qur'an, &quot;And when the word 
    is fulfilled concerning them. We shall bring forth a Beast of the Earth to 
    speak unto them because mankind had no faith in our revelation.&quot; (Surah An-Naml, 
    ayat:82)</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">Abdullah-b-Umar said, &quot;I memorised a 
    Hadith from the Messenger of Allah which I have not forgotten. I heard the 
    Messenger of Allah saying, 'The first of the signs that will come is the 
    rising of the sun from the place of its setting and the emergence of the 
    Beast upon the people. Whichever of these two occurs before the other then 
    the other is right behind it.&quot; (Muslim) </font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4"><br>
    Commentating on the above verse Ibne Kathir has said that the beast will 
    appear very near the end of time. When disintegration, corruption, kufr and 
    evil prevail, commands of Allah are ignored, the Deen changed and made a 
    mockery of, it is then Allah will take out the Beast from the earth. (Ibne 
    Kathir) </font></p>

  <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Fire in the Hijaz:</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">The last major sign to appear before the 
    Day of Judgment is the fire which will come out from the Yemen and gather 
    the people in the place of their assembly.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font size="4">In the Hadith of Hudaifa-b-Usaid regarding 
    the Major signs the Prophet said, &quot;At the end of which a fire would burn out 
    from Yemen and would drive people to the place of their assembly.&quot; (Muslim)</font></p>
