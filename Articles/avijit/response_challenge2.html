<p>If someone says in some article that each Bangladeshi is intelligent; then it 
implies Mr. Avijit Roy, as a Bangladeshi, is also intelligent. Mr. Avijit can 
not argue himself that since his name is not mentioned he is not intelligent, he 
is foolish. Or he can not say that the article is inaccurate.</p>

	<p>What&nbsp; &quot;Avijit Roy&quot; or &quot;Bangladeshi intelligence&quot; has to do here is 
	beyond my understanding. The author has genuinely committed Red Herring. 
	Author's analogy is also false in this respect. &quot;...since his name is not

<p>To prove the Quran as inaccurate or non-scientific you have to prove some 
verse in the Quran as inaccurate and non-scientific. The Quran came 1400 years 
ago to the Arab first; most of whom were illiterate and far away from the light 
of civilization. No scientists of modern age could prove a single verse of the 
Quran as inaccurate or non-scientific.</p>

	<p>There are tons of articles available refuting the above claims. The 
	author is either unaware of the facts or just trying to misguide. According 
	to Qur’an our Earth is flat (read verses 15:19, 20:53, 43.10, 50: 7, 51:48, 
	etc.., check the <i>Arabic words</i> Madda, Madadnaha, Firasha, Mahdan, 
	Farashnaha, Bisata, Mihada, Dahaha, Tahaha and Sutehat; and the late sheikh 
	Abdul Aziz Bin Baz,&nbsp; the highest Islamic authority in Saudi Arabia at 
	his time issued a&nbsp; fatwa that earth is flat and those Muslims who say 
	otherwise contradict the Quranic teachings) and both the sun and the moon 
	run across it. They are “lamps” hanging from the ceiling of the sky that is 
	being supported by invisible columns. The Quranic solar system also contains 
	invisible genies. They climb over each other’s shoulders and reach the 
	heaven to eavesdrop the conversation of the “Exalted Assembly”. The stars 
	are used as missiles (shooting stars) to hit them (genies) [see Q67.5] . The 
	moon is supposed to be above the stars. Then sun also must rise from muddy 
	waters and enter in the murky waters just as Zul Qaranain witnessed (Q 
	18:86, 18:90). There is also a position for

	the throne of Allah</a> (see Q<b> <span lang="EN-AU">2:255<O:P>, 13:2, 
	25:59, 32:4, 57:4 etc.) </span></b>. But the throne is over the waters and

	to rise ( see:

<p>See, the lack of our knowledge. Still the human being does not know the solar 
system completely. Recently the scientists presented another hypothesis: the 
Uranus has 27 natural satellites and 13 rings; instead of 23 natural satellites 
and 11 rings hypothesized before using the Hubble Telescope.</p>
<p>[Response]</p>
<p>So what it has to do with Quran? Yes I know human knowledge is limited. 
That's why we are dependent on science and scientific advancement. See how much 
advancement we have already made in last century, and we are still advancing. 
Science gives us scope and opportunity to raise question, whereas religious 
dogma does not. How can these two are comparable? If sun must rise and set in 
muddy waters, or Allah sits on a throne according to Quran, you cant change or 
even question no matter how absurd it looks. A believer's job is to obey and 
follow the way what the scripture&nbsp; reveals.</p>
<p>[mohammad awrangjeb ]</p>
<p>the Quran is full of wisdom. It only contains the sayings of the almighty 
Allah SWT. He has created us and everything around us. He knows what we do not 
know. He knows the absolute truth. <b>He needs no hypothesis to test. </b></p>
<p>[Response]</p>
<p>Then it is NO science. The scientific method or scientific process is 
fundamental to scientific investigation and to the acquisition of new knowledge 
based upon physical evidence by the scientific community. Scientists use 
observations and reasoning to propose tentative explanations for natural 
phenomena, termed hypotheses. Under the working assumption of methodological 
materialism, observable events in nature are explained only by natural causes 
without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural. Predictions 
from these hypotheses are tested by various experiments, which should be 
reproducible. An important aspect of a hypothesis is that it must be 
falsifiable, in other words, it must be conceivable to prove the hypothesis to 
be false (which Religion does not allow BTW). If a proposition is not 
falsifiable, then it is not a hypothesis, and instead an opinion or statement 
outside of the scope of scientific inquiry. It should also be noted that a 
hypothesis cannot be proven, rather, the data from a given experiment designed 
to test a hypothesis can either support or disprove that hypothesis. If quran 
does not allow this, it is no science. Please make it very clear.&nbsp; If its 
not science, We do not need any more argument on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mohammad Awrangajeb]</p>
<p>If you are in doubt as to that which We have revealed to Our servant, then 
produce a chapter like it (Without any mistake, total in agreement with true 
scientific facts, which describes history in great details, and it also predict 
the future events and it should be most comprehensive: in short, it produces the 
same results as Quran produces after implement) and call on your witnesses 
besides Allah if you are truthful. But if you do (it) not and never shall you do 
(it), then be on your guard against the fire of which men and stones are the 
fuel; it is prepared for the unbelievers. ..</p>
