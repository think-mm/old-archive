  <p>For quite some time we are bombarded in myriad e-forums, web-sites, videos 
	and books with the assertion that Islam is a very scientific religion. 
	Diehard Islamic scholars are eager to prove that many modern-day scientific 
	discoveries were accurately predicted in the Qur'an. In fact, in recent 
	years, soon after<span style="color: #003300"><a href="http://humanists.net/avijit/article/western_scientists_.htm" target="_blank"> Dr.
  Maurice Bucaille and Keith Moore's (in)famous book&nbsp;</a> </span>came into 
	limelight a number of &quot;Islamic Scientists&quot; have claimed that there is 
	credible evidence of modern science in Islam as revealed in their miraculous 
	Holy book, the Qur'an. My two-part article has been written to expose the 
	fallacy of that claim. In the first part of my article I provided a critique 
	of five contemporary claims that the Qur'an miraculously supports the recent 
	developments in science. In this part, I will refute five more such claims 
	and argue that science makes a strong case against &quot;Islamic Science&quot; and 
	&quot;miraculous nature&quot; of the Holy Qur'an.</p>
  <p>I shall start this part with an excerpt from a book written by a famous 
	Bangladeshi religious scientist, Professor Shamsher Ali, the Chairman of the 
	Committee on Science in Al-Qur'an, Islamic Foundation, Bangladesh. He also 
	teaches in the Physics Department of the Dhaka University. This is what this 
	Bangladeshi scientist says:</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">
	&quot;Anybody having the faith in this absolute truth is welcome to use the 
    Qur'an as a test for our scientific principle and not vice versa. 
    Incidentally it may be mentioned that Maurice Bucaille in his book, <i>The 
    Qur'an, the Bible and Science</i> already asserted : There is not a single 
    verse in Holy Qur'an which is assailable from scientific point of view&quot;. Our 
    present work fully support this assertion&quot;&nbsp; [<a href="#1">1</a>]&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is a real irony--an extraordinary claim from a scientist I must say! 
	The author, even being one of the renowned celebrities in scientific 
	community in Bangladesh, puts the Qur'an as an authentic tool to test 
	science, and NOT vice versa! A true scientist will never follow this 
	approach, as he should know, science is not faith; it accepts a theory as a 
	tentative truth--only if it explains the observations of reality better 
	compared to the elucidation based on logic and evidence. For example, if a 
	new scientific hypothesis or theory is put forward it is rigorously 
	scrutinized, experiments done, observations made and if all the results 
	correspond to the theory, it is accepted until it is refuted by later 
	observations and tests. All the methods lay well within the strict domain of 
	science. No sane person can legitimately claim to test science against a 
	religious holy book. A religious book, to be precise, preaches absoluteness 
	and infallibility of its claim of the perceived truth, which is nothing but 
	a dogma. Dogma does not admit any possibility of its being wrong—thus ruling 
	out any revision or correction. Then, how can a dogma be a tool to test 
	science? I wonder what our students will learn if such a capricious 
	definition of science, formulated by Dr. Shamsher Ali is taught in our 
	Universities. This is one of many examples to show how our education system 
	is faltering. Recently, another author of Islami-scientific book proclaimed 
	that the Qur'an itself is enough to reveal the scientific mysteries of 
	nature; rest are all redundant and superfluous<span style="color: #003300"> [<a href="#2">2</a>].&nbsp;</span>If 
	we really have such a super-scientific book in our hand who needs Brian 
	Greene's <i>The Elegant Universe</i>, Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History 
	of Time</i> or Steven Weinberg's <i>The First Three Minutes</i> to explore 
	mystery to common people? Forget about popular science series, why did 
	Newton wrote his famous <i>Principia</i>?—this I can’t comprehend either. 
	Indeed, this claim means every single scientific invention is supposed to be 
	as claimed in the Qur'an--and the rest are redundant. Does not this mean if 
	the entire room is illuminated by 1000 watts of light who will look for a 
	candle?</p>

	<p>Nowhere in the Qur'an it is mentioned that the Sun is a source of light

  <p>If a reader reads the above verse carefully he will notice that there is no 
	allusion of &quot;source of light&quot; or &quot;deflector&quot; in this verse. It simply says: 
	the Sun is a shining brightness (&quot;splendor and glory of brightness&quot;) and the 
	Moon a light!<span style="color: #003300"><br>
  &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>From their daily observation right from the ancient period people knew that 
	the Sun had strong and bright light and the Moon had cool and softer light 
	that illuminates and helps in the darkness of the night. In Bangla we 
	commonly say<span style="color: #003300"> <img border="0" src="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/roudro_topto.gif" width="66" height="21">and
  <img border="0" src="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/avijit/chondralokito_rat.gif" width="86" height="21"> in 
	the same manner in English we use &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Moonlight&quot;. This means 
	ancient Bengali/Englishmen also realized that the Sun is more 
	shinning/bright/hot than the appealing Moon just the way an ancient Arab 
	could observe the same phenomena. In fact, it is so simple even to an 
	infant. Here I quote the two words that Qur'an uses [<a href="#3">3</a>]:</span></p>

  </font>
  <p>Dr<span style="color: #003300"> Bucaille, however,&nbsp; in his book 
	proclaimed loudly [<a href="#7">7</a>]:</span></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">The Sun is a shining glory (<i>diya'</i>) and the 
		Moon a light (<i>nur</i>). This translation would appear to be more 
		correct than those given by others, where the two terms are inverted. In 
		fact there is little difference in meaning since <i>diya'</i> belongs to 
		a root (<i>dw'</i>) which, according to Kazimirski's authoritative 
		Arabic/French dictionary, means 'to be bright, to shine' (e.g. like a 
		fire). The same author attributes to the substantive in question the 
		meaning of 'light'.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p><span style="color: #003300">The above explanation of Dr Bucaille may be 
	correct. However, any rational person can perceive that such an explanation 
	need not pertain to any extraordinary miraculous claim when we consider the 
	historical context of the ancient Arabs. For readers’ interest the next part 
	of the verse is quoted below:<br>
  &nbsp;</span></p>
  <font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times" color="#003300">
  <p>

  <i>and the moon a light, and ordained for it mansions that you might know the 
  computation of years and the reckoning.<br>
  &nbsp;</i></p>
  </font>
  <p>This portion is not miraculous at all. The ancient Arabs used the Sun and 
	the Moon to measure location and time. The lunar months and the lunar years 
	are quite commonly used by pastoral people. Interestingly, now-a-days, 
	science has advanced so far that we do not need to use the Moon to measure 
	time. Curiously, on this recent development, the &quot;miraculous&quot; Qur'an could 
	not provide the slightest indication beforehand.</p>

  <p>The scientific Atomic theory has nothing to do with this Qur'anic Atom. 
	This atom is used in the Qur'an to denote small particles. When the Arabs 
	tried to talk about small particles they could not find a suitable word to 
	describe them; the only appropriate word they could use was<span style="color: #003300"> &quot;zarah&quot; (</span><span class="postbody"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">dharra</span></span><span style="color: #003300">)

  <p>If the Qur'an really talked scientifically about atoms and molecules we 
	should have some indication about electrons, protons and neutrons. But there 
	is no real indication of them in the whole Qur'an. If any scientist claims 
	that the Qur'an really talks about Atomic physics then he must show us where 
	we may get the scientific idea of Nuclear structure, how can one observe 
	Rutherford scattering, how can one acquire the knowledge of Static 
	properties of nucleus, such as angular momentum, parity, size shape, 
	magnetic multiple moments, electric multiple moments etc., and how about the 
	Dynamic properties; such as nuclear reaction etc.? Neither do we get any 
	idea from the Qur'an about the Strong Interaction model and the Weak 
	Interaction model, nor can we develop, using the Qur'anic principle, any 
	well-established model: such as Fermi degenerate gas model, Alpha particle 
	model, Liquid drop model, Shell model, Optical model, Collective model or 
	compound nucleus model. The Qur'an could only imagine, very ambiguously, 
	small particles as <i>speck of dust</i> and <i>small ants</i>. While the 
	Islamic scientists try to prove that the Qur'an is super-scientific they 
	usually try to explicate the words<i> out of its context</i>
	<span style="color: #003300">&nbsp;[<a href="#5">5</a>].</span></p>
	<p><span style="color: #003300">Again, if someone's prediction on something 
	implying that that would be an evidence of divine inspiration and an aura of 
	supernaturalism then we must bestow that credit to Epicurus (341-270 BC), 
	who predicted, in his poetic summary ‘<i>De Rerum Natura</i>’, in far less 
	ambiguous terms than anything purportedly present in the Qur'an, the 
	existence of atoms and the molecules (the binding of two atoms to produce a 
	different chemical) [<a href="#6">6</a>]. Following the principles of the 
	Islamic scholars should we then consider Epicurus a Prophet or his book a 
	divine scripture? Even before Epicurus, around 440 BC, Leucippus of Miletus 
	originated the concept of atom. Later, he and his pupil, Democritus (460-371 
	BC) of Abdera, refined and extended this idea. There were five major points 
	to their atomic theory at that time. Epicurus, to be precise, developed the 
	work of Leucippus and Democritus and had made their ideas widely known. From 
	ancient history we also learn that significant contributions were made by 
	Indian philosophers. Long before Muhammad was born, Kanada, the founder of 
	the Vaisesika system of philosophy expounded that all matters in this 
	universe consists of atoms. The Tamil word for <i>atom</i> is “anu” (in 
	Bangla we also use the same) which is an ancient word, mentioned in Tamil 
	literatures in 600 AD or even earlier [<a href="#24">24</a>]! So there is 
	absolutely no valid reason to claim that the Qur'an, written in later 
	period, solely and miraculously predicted certain assertions on atom now 
	established by modern science.</span></p>

	bigger and the Sun and the Moon are to be much smaller. As per the Qur’an 
	they are “lamps” hanging from the ceiling of the sky supported in turn by 
	invisible columns. Allah also described the heaven (sky) made of seven 
	layers and placed (wrongly) the stars in the lowest layer i.e., lower than 
	the Moon:</span></p>
	<blockquote>

	</blockquote>
	<p><span style="color: #003300">The Qur'anic solar system also contains the invisible 
	<i>Jinns</i>. </span>These <i>Jinns</i>, according to Qur'an are made of 
	fire and <span style="color: #003300">they climb over each other’s shoulders 
	and reach the heaven to eavesdrop the conversation of the “Exalted 
	Assembly”. Let us read the following verses from the Qur'an:</span></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p><i><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/037.qmt.html#037.008">

		</i>
		<span style="color: #003300">“And (the Jinn who had listened to the

		strong warders and meteors. And we used to sit on places (high) therein 
		to listen. But he who listeneth now findeth a flame in wait for him;&quot;</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>But the most interesting part is that Allah believed that the shooting 
	stars and the meteors are the missiles thrown at the eavesdropping <i>Jinns</i>. 
	Here is what the Qur’an says:&nbsp;</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		<i>

	<p>The universe, as envisioned by Muhammad/Allah belongs to nothing but on 
	the realm of fairy tales. It is not that Mr. Bucaille, while writing his 
	famous book <i>The Bible, the Qu'ran and Science</i> was unaware of such 
	nonsensical stories as 'projectiles for the stoning of ‘demons’ (5: 67), or 
	'guard against every rebellious evil spirit' referred in verse 21: 32 and 
	verse 41:12, etc.; however, he cleverly tried to avoid the topic saying, 
	&quot;All these observations seem to lay outside the subject of this study&quot;&nbsp; [<a href="#9">9</a>]
	<span style="color: #003300"> 
	for obvious reason. The author also said that scientific data were unable to 
	cast any light on a subject that went beyond human understanding but 
	conveniently forgot to tell us which scientific data satisfied him when the 
	Qur'an said that the Sun also must arise from the muddy waters and must 
	enter the murky waters just as Dzul Qaranain had witnessed <i>(Q<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/018.qmt.html#018.086">18:86</a>,

	<p><span style="color: #003300">There is also a location in sky for the

	that Dr Bucaille seems to forget. The throne, according to Hadith, is over 
	the waters <i>(</i></span><i><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/054.sbt.html#004.054.414">Sahih

	<p>In his book, Bucaille repeatedly claimed, &quot;there is nothing in the text 
	of the Qur'an that contradicts what we know today,&quot; but the above citations 
	from the Qur'an and Hadith about modern cosmology reveals the truth which 
	are nothing short of scientific heresies. Despite the desperate attempt of 
	Bucaille and some Muslim apologists [<a href="#14">14</a>] to re-interpret 
	and find some esoteric meaning hidden within these vague verses, their 
	obvious contrast with science, logic and common sense is enough to realize 
	that Qur'an is not founded by any divine inspiration. </p>

	anyone who has the slightest idea what scientific knowledge is all about.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>Let's see how Dr William Campbell refuted the Qur'anic science of Bucaille 
	[<a href="#15">15</a>] 
  :</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dr Bucaille declares that until the late sixteenth century &quot;man held 
    totally inaccurate views on the water cycle'', and considers that several 
    statements in the Qur'an which reflect a knowledge of the water cycle could 
    not therefore have come from any human source.</p>
    <p>He quotes verses 50:9-11, 35:9, 30:48, 7:57, 25:48-49, and 45:5, as the 
	verses which include steps (2), (3), and (4a) above. As an example, we shall 
	look at the late Meccan Sura of the <i>Heights</i> (Al-A`rúf) 7:57,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>''(God) is the One Who sends forth the winds like heralds of His Mercy. 
      When they have carried (2) the heavy-laden clouds, We drive them to 
      a dead land. Then We cause (3) water to descend and thereby (4a) 
      bring forth fruits of every kind. Thus We will bring forth the dead. Maybe 
      you will remember.''</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To demonstrate step (4b) above he brings verses from Suras 23:18-19, 
    15:22, and the <i>late Meccan Sura</i> of <i>The Crowds</i> (Al-Zumar) 39:21 
	which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>''Have you not seen that God sent water down from the sky and led it 
      through (4b) sources into the ground? Then he caused sown fields of 
      different colors to grow.''</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These verses are accurate, of course, but 
    the question is do they show any special foreknowledge and thereby prove Divine 
    Revelation? The answer must surely be &quot;no.&quot; Every man or woman, even those 
    living in a city, could describe steps (2), (3), and (4a). 
    And every person in contact with farmers during a drought will hear them say 
    that their wells and springs have dried up, thus showing common knowledge of 
    step (4b) that rain is the source and origin of underground water.</p>
    <p>But what of step (1)? – the evaporation as the source of rain clouds. 
	This will be more difficult to understand by simple observation only, and, 
	it could not be evident to the ancient people when the Qur'an was revealed. 
	But does the Qur'an has any verse to clarify the evaporation process? 
	Unfortunately, there is not a single verse to support such claim.&nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It can be pointed out that there is no end to the strange miracles Muslim 
	scholars are claiming. If one visits the prominent Islamic sites [<a href="#14">14</a>], 
	one will find hundreds of such inane arguments. Currently, I have no time to 
	rebut all those wild claims and declare myself a victory. The good news is 
	that many of my skeptic friends, working in parallel are doing a wonderful 
	job in the Net. For example, Richard Carrier debunked Dr Mansour 
	Hassab-Elnaby's claim on the speed of light [<a href="#16">16</a>];&nbsp; 
	Ali Sina refuted Harun Yahya's claim on atmospheric layers [<a href="#17">17</a>], 
	Abul Kasem and Syed Kamran Mirza debunked the claim on mountains [<a href="#18">18</a>,
	<a href="#19">19</a>],&nbsp; Dr. Alamgir Hussain refuted the Qur'anic 
	prophecies on Pharaohs [<a href="#25">25</a>]….etc. I will rest my case analyzing another miracle 
	which has been frequently quoted in Islamic web-sites in recent days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	Actually, in this verse Islamic Allah (through his obedient Prophet) was 
	just trying to scare people with tales of blazing fires and dreadful 
	actions. The above verse is, therefore, another example of Prophet's 
	scare-mongering verses, when we realize that the sentence ‘sky opens and 
	becomes red (with fire)’ does not connote to any scientific miracle 
	whatsoever.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <p>A closer chronological observation of the verses from 55:26 to 55:38 gives 
	us an impression that the author is trying to frighten people about the 
	so-called <i>Judgment Day</i> [<a href="#21">21</a>]. Let's quote from the 
	Qur'an:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Everyone that is thereon will pass away; There remaineth but the
  Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. Which is it, of the favours of
  your Lord, that ye deny? All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat
  Him. Every day He exerciseth (universal) power. Which is it, of the favours of
  your Lord, that ye deny? We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man and
  jinn). Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? O company of
  jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and
  the earth, then penetrate (them)! Ye will never penetrate them save with (Our)
  sanction. Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? There will
  be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye will not
  escape. Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? And when the
  heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide -Which is it, of the
  favours of your Lord, that ye deny? -On that day neither man nor jinni will be
  questioned of his sin.<br>&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
	<p>From the citations above, these two particular verses could be our 
	interest because Allah clearly declares his future motivation to settle our 
	affairs (on the <i>Judgment Day</i>):</p>
	<blockquote>
  <p><br><em><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/055.qmt.html#055.031">055.031</a></em><br>
	<strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> Soon shall We settle your affairs, O both ye
  worlds!<br><strong>PICKTHAL:</strong> We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man
  and jinn).<br><strong>SHAKIR:</strong> Soon will We apply Ourselves to you, O you two
  armies.</p>
  <p><em><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/055.qmt.html#055.039">055.039</a></em><br>
  <strong>YUSUFALI:</strong> On that Day no question will be asked of man or
  Jinn as to his sin.<br>
  <strong>PICKTHAL:</strong> On that day neither man nor jinni will be
  questioned of his sin.<br>
  <strong>SHAKIR:</strong> So on that day neither man nor jinni shall be asked
  about his sin.
  <br>
  <br>

  <p>Thus any rational person can conclude that there is no relation with red 
	star nebula if we consider the context. However, Muslim scholars wishfully 
	matched this up with the subject of astrophysics. We all know that there are 
	many Nebulae very far away from our planet. If we look at them with powerful 
	telescopes they will appear to be red because it is going away from us. All 
	stars are going away from us because the universe is expanding and therefore 
	they are red. This is the famous Red Shift that Hubble discovered. We, 
	however, cannot see this with our plain eyes; we can only see it through the 
	most powerful telescopes. The reddish color of this particular Nebula shown 
	in the picture above, however, is not the cause of expansion of space as 
	explained previously. This particular picture was taken by the NASA Hubble 
	Space Telescope of the &quot;Cat's Eye Nebula&quot;, an explosion of a supernova that 
	took place 3,000 years ago. This is a glass-hour explosion seen from the 
	top. Actually, these photographs were taken by NASA in infrared or X-ray 
	spectrum. In this particular picture false colors were added using color 
	algorithm by NASA at the time of releasing. NASA allotted the red color to 
	this picture, but they could virtually had given any color they liked. So 
	the whole argument of relating this with Qur’anic dicta -&quot;rosy like red 
	hide&quot; becomes completely meaningless [<a href="#22">22</a>].</p>
  <p>Aparthib [<a href="#23">23</a>] also has written quite a number of articles 
	refuting such Islamic pseudo-scientific claims i.e., the attempt to relate 
	vague verses of the Qur'an with scientific inventions. I remember in 
	response to an apologist’s claim of such vague &quot;miracle&quot;, Aparthib once 
	wrote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;I see an attempt here to link planetary nebulae with a religious verse. 
    This is a flawed attempt that is often made by apologetics of all religions, 
    some more than others. If one likes to see science in anything they can see 
    it anywhere. Some Joe may have said &quot;All is relative&quot; before Einstein's 
    theory of relativity. By this stretch of imagination that Joe can 
    legitimately claim that he already knew about relativity and claim 
    originality. Any vague phrase, pun, quote etc. by humans, scriptures etc. can 
    be customized and made to fit any scientific principle which also have been 
    phrased in a very general way for popular consumption hiding the underlying 
    precise sense of these principles. Its an insult to science and the 
    scientists whose painstaking research has helped unravel the complex 
    workings of the laws of nature and reality. None of these scientific 
    revelations were inspired from, dependent on, or utilized any of the 
    religious revelations. If religious revelations could not and did not lead 
    to any of these scientific truths in a stand alone way then by any criterion 
    and logic they cannot be used to corroborate science. There are many 
    unanswered questions in the basic understanding of the universe. Why can't 
    the verses of scripture throw any light on them? For example we don't at 
    this time know for sure if the universe is closed, open or flat. No body 
    dares to make a prediction based on any revelation. But if it is ever found 
    out by science I am sure one can dig out some vague words of a verse from 
    some book of some religion and claim to &quot;see&quot; the answer that science has 
    finally managed to find. <b>Its always AFTER the fact that 
    these semblances are found. It has never been found BEFORE the scientific 
    discovery. Is that a 
    coincidence?</b>&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Then Aparthib went on, saying&nbsp; 
  -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Nobel laureate Physicist 
    Dr. Abdus Salam warned against people trying to explain Big Bang using 
    verses from Koran, saying that the current version of Big Bang is the best 
    known scientific explanation for the creation of the universe. What if a 
    better scientific explanation than Big Bang is found tomorrow? Should the 
    verses be changed to accommodate the new scientific view? Religion can never 
    vindicate or falsify science. The truth or falsity of a scientific principle 
    lies within science itself. Religious scriptures cannot 
    speak of any scientific principle. Religious revelations are absolute 
    directives and narratives for humans to follow as faith unquestioningly. 
    Many revelations clearly contradict many accepted scientific principles. 
    No scientist of any repute have ever tried to substantiate scientific 
    principles by religious beliefs. Most scientists and theologians would 
    rather not mix faith with objective and rational field of science. 
    Koran/Bible/Gita etc are not books of science. Any coincidental vague 
    semblance between a verse and a popular phrasing of a complex scientific 
    principle is solely due to the very general and vague wordings admitting of 
    any interpretation that one chooses to impose on it. All one needs is some 
    vague reverse fitting argument to connect the two. One can find Quantum 
    Mechanics in Tagore's poems, or relativity in the Buddhist Monk Nagarjun's 
    writing. Just seeing what one likes to see because of a preset belief in a favored
    belief system doesn't make it so by any objective criterion. My 
    purpose is not to disrespect religion or its revelation, but to question the 
    attempt to reconcile the two in an illogical way. They can be irreconcilable 
    and yet can continue and thrive as separate ways as long as one does not get 
    in the way of the pursuit of the other.&quot;</p>

  <p>While debating in many <i>Bangladeshi Internet forums</i> [<a href="#26">26</a>] 
	I have noted that the modern educated Muslims love to cite many such fuzzy 
	scientific miracles from the <i>holy Qur'an</i> to promote the divine origin 
	of their faith. In this two-part essay I have debunked top ten of these 
	claims. I hope my attempt will provide a better understanding that no 
	supernatural supreme being handed any kind of scientific information to 
	Muhammad. Those alleged miracles in the Qur'an simply fail to offer any 
	reasonable rational argument to support any claim of divine source for the 
	Qur’an. No sensible person or freethinker should be swayed by such phony 
	divine assertion.</p>
