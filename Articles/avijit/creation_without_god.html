<h1 align="center">Creation Without God or <i>ex-Nihilo</i> : Some quotes from 
Scientific Literature for the support</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many are aware of the fact that physicists are generally comming to the 
conclusion that things - perhaps even the entire universe - <i>can</i> indeed 
arise from nothing via natural processes.&nbsp; Alan Guth, the father of 
Inflation theory, pointed out&nbsp; in his book &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201328402/002-2464239-0391212?v=glance&n=283155">The 
Inflationary Universe: The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins</a>&quot; (1997),
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify">&quot;The question of the origin of the matter in the Universe 
	is no longer thought to be beyond science. After two thousand years of 
	scientific research, it now seems that Lucretius was wrong. Conceivably, 
	everything can be created from nothing. And 'everything' might include a lot 
	more than what we can see. In the context of inflationary cosmology, it is 
	fair to say that universe is the ultimate free lunch.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;This short document is an attempt to compile quotes that explain how 
all of this &quot;free lunch&quot; was possible following laws of physics. </p>
<p>Eventually, I would like to write an article assessing the value of quantum 
vacuum fluctuations as a means of producing universes, but for the time being, I 
will just let the scientists speak for themselves and leave evaluation to the 
reader. The work is an extension of

<b>Vacuum Fluctuations and Virtual Particles</b> 
<ul>
	<hr>
	<li>In the everyday world, energy is always unalterably fixed; the law of 
	energy conservation is a cornerstone of classical physics. But in the 
	quantum microworld, energy can appear and disappear out of nowhere in a 
	spontaneous and unpredictable fashion. (Davies, 1983, 162)<hr></li>
	<li>The uncertainty principle implies that particles can come into existence 
	for short periods of time even when there is not enough energy to create 
	them. In effect, they are created from uncertainties in energy. One could 
	say that they briefly &quot;borrow&quot; the energy required for their creation, and 
	then, a short time later, they pay the &quot;debt&quot; back and disappear again. 
	Since these particles do not have a permanent existence, they are called 
	virtual particles. (Morris, 1990, 24)<hr></li>
	<li>Even though we can't see them, we know that these virtual particles are 
	&quot;really there&quot; in empty space because they leave a detectable trace of their 
	activities. One effect of virtual photons, for example, is to produce a tiny 
	shift in the energy levels of atoms. They also cause an equally tiny change 
	in the magnetic moment of electrons. These minute but significant 
	alterations have been very accurately measured using spectroscopic 
	techniques. (Davies, 1994, 32)<hr></li>
	<li>[Virtual particle pairs] are predicted to have a calculable effect upon 
	the energy levels of atoms. The effect expected is minute - only a change of 
	one part in a billion, but it has been confirmed by experimenters.<p>In 1953 
	Willis Lamb measured this excited energy state for a hydrogen atom. This is 
	now called the Lamb shift. The energy difference predicted by the effects of 
	the vacuum on atoms is so small that it is only detectable as a transition 
	at microwave frequencies. The precision of microwave measurements is so 
	great that Lamb was able to measure the shift to five significant figures. 
	He subsequently received the Nobel Prize for his work. No doubt remains that 
	virtual particles are really there. (Barrow &amp; Silk, 1993, 65-66)</p>
	<hr></li>
	<li>In modern physics, there is no such thing as &quot;nothing.&quot; Even in a 
	perfect vacuum, pairs of virtual particles are constantly being created and 
	destroyed. The existence of these particles is no mathematical fiction. 
	Though they cannot be directly observed, the effects they create are quite 
	real. The assumption that they exist leads to predictions that have been 
	confirmed by experiment to a high degree of accuracy. (Morris, 1990, 25)<hr>
	</li>
</ul>
<b>Vacuum Fluctuations, the Origin of the Universe and Inflation</b><ul>
	<hr>
	<li>There are something like ten million million million million million 
	million million million million million million million million million (1 
	with eighty [five] zeroes after it) particles in the region of the universe 
	that we can observe. Where did they all come from? The answer is that, in 
	quantum theory, particles can be created out of energy in the form of 
	particle/antiparticle pairs. But that just raises the question of where the 
	energy came from. The answer is that the total energy of the universe is 
	exactly zero. The matter in the universe is made out of positive energy. 
	However, the matter is all attracting itself by gravity. Two pieces of 
	matter that are close to each other have less energy than the same two 
	pieces a long way apart, because you have to expend energy to separate them 
	against the gravitational force that is pulling them together. Thus, in a 
	sense, the gravitational field has negative energy. In the case of a 
	universe that is approximately uniform in space, one can show that this 
	negative gravitational energy exactly cancels the positive energy 
	represented by the matter. So the total energy of the universe is zero. 
	(Hawking, 1988, 129) [thanks to Ross King for this quote]<hr></li>
	<li>There is a still more remarkable possibility, which is the creation of 
	matter from a state of zero energy. This possibility arises because energy 
	can be both positive and negative. The energy of motion or the energy of 
	mass is always positive, but the energy of attraction, such as that due to 
	certain types of gravitational or electromagnetic field, is negative. 
	Circumstances can arise in which the positive energy that goes to make up 
	the mass of newly-created particles of matter is exactly offset by the 
	negative energy of gravity of electromagnetism. For example, in the vicinity 
	of an atomic nucleus the electric field is intense. If a nucleus containing 
	200 protons could be made (possible but difficult), then the system becomes 
	unstable against the spontaneous production of electron-positron pairs, 
	without any energy input at all. The reason is that the negative electric 
	energy can exactly offset the energy of their masses.<p>In the gravitational 
	case the situation is still more bizarre, for the gravitational field is 
	only a spacewarp - curved space. The energy locked up in a spacewarp can be 
	converted into particles of matter and antimatter. This occurs, for example, 
	near a black hole, and was probably also the most important source of 
	particles in the big bang. Thus, matter appears spontaneously out of empty 
	space. The question then arises, did the primeval bang possess energy, or is 
	the entire universe a state of zero energy, with the energy of all the 
	material offset by negative energy of gravitational attraction?</p>
	<p>It is possible to settle the issue by a simple calculation. Astronomers 
	can measure the masses of galaxies, their average separation, and their 
	speeds of recession. Putting these numbers into a formula yields a quantity 
	which some physicists have interpreted as the total energy of the universe. 
	The answer does indeed come out to be zero wihin the observational accuracy. 
	The reason for this distinctive result has long been a source of puzzlement 
	to cosmologists. Some have suggested that there is a deep cosmic principle 
	at work which requires the universe to have exactly zero energy. If that is 
	so the cosmos can follow the path of least resistance, coming into existence 
	without requiring any input of matter or energy at all. (Davies, 1983, 
	31-32)</p>
	<hr></li>
	<li>Once our minds accept the mutability of matter and the new idea of the 
	vacuum, we can speculate on the origin of the biggest thing we know - the 
	universe. Maybe the universe itself sprang into existence out of nothingness 
	- a gigantic vacuum fluctuation which we know today as the big bang. 
	Remarkably, the laws of modern physics allow for this possibility. (Pagels, 
	1982, 247)<hr></li>
	<li>In general relativity, spacetime can be empty of matter or radiation and 
	still contain energy stored in its curvature. Uncaused, random quantum 
	fluctuations in a flat, empty, featureless spacetime can produce local 
	regions with positive or negative curvature. This is called the &quot;spacetime 
	foam&quot; and the regions are called &quot;bubbles of false vacuum.&quot; Wherever the 
	curvature is positive a bubble of false vacuum will, according to Einstein's 
	equations, exponentially inflate. In 10<sup>-42</sup> seconds the bubble 
	will expand to the size of a proton and the energy within will be sufficient 
	to produce all the mass of the universe.<p>The bubbles start out with no 
	matter, radiation, or force fields and maximum entropy. They contain energy 
	in their curvature, and so are a &quot;false vacuum.&quot; As they expand, the energy 
	within increases exponentially. This does not violate energy conservation 
	since the false vacuum has a negative pressure (believe me, this is all 
	follows from the equations that Einstein wrote down in 1916) so the 
	expanding bubble does work on itself.</p>
	<p>As the bubble universe expands, a kind of friction occurs in which energy 
	is converted into particles. The temperature then drops and a series of 
	spontaneous symmetry breaking processes occurs, as in a magnet cooled below 
	the Curie point and a essentially random structure of the particles and 
	forces appears. Inflation stops and we move into the more familiar big bang.</p>
	<p>The forces and particles that appear are more-or-less random, governed 
	only by symmetry principles (like the conservation principles of energy and 
	momentum) that are also not the product of design but exactly what one has 
	in the absence of design.</p>
	<p>The so-called &quot;anthropic coincidences,&quot; in which the particles and forces 
	of physics seem to be &quot;fine-tuned&quot; for the production of Carbon-based life 
	are explained by the fact that the spacetime foam has an infinite number of 
	universes popping off, each different. We just happen to be in the one where 
	the forces and particles lent themselves to the generation of carbon and 
	other atoms with the complexity necessary to evolve living and thinking 
	organisms. (Stenger, 1996)</p>
	<hr></li>
	<li>Where did all the matter and radiation in the universe come from in the 
	first place? Recent intriguing theoretical research by physicists such as 
	Steven Weinberg of Harvard and Ya. B. Zel'dovich in Moscow suggest that the 
	universe began as a perfect vacuum and that all the particles of the 
	material world were created from the expansion of space...<p>Think about the 
	universe immediately after the Big Bang. Space is violently expanding with 
	explosive vigor. Yet, as we have seen, all space is seething with virtual 
	pairs of particles and antiparticles. Normally, a particle and anti-particle 
	have no trouble getting back together in a time interval...short enough so 
	that the conservation of mass is satisfied under the uncertainty principle. 
	During the Big Bang, however, space was expanding so fast that particles 
	were rapidly pulled away from their corresponding antiparticles. Deprived of 
	the opportunity to recombine, these virtual particles had to become real 
	particles in the real world. Where did the energy come from to achieve this 
	materialization?</p>
	<p>Recall that the Big Bang was like the center of a black hole. A vast 
	supply of gravitational energy was therefore associated with the intense 
	gravity of this cosmic singularity. This resource provided ample energy to 
	completely fill the universe with all conceivable kinds of particles and 
	antiparticles. Thus, immediately after the Planck time, the universe was 
	flooded with particles and antiparticles created by the violent expansion of 
	space. (Kaufmann, 1985, 529-532)</p>
	<hr></li>
	<li>...the idea of a First Cause sounds somewhat fishy in light of the 
	modern theory of quantum mechanics. According to the most commonly accepted 
	interpretation of quantum mechanics, individual subatomic particles can 
	behave in unpredictable ways and there are numerous random, uncaused events. 
	(Morris, 1997, 19)<hr></li>
