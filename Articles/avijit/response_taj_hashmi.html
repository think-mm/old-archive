&gt; This is really unfortunate that the Mukto-Mona moderators have again <br>
&gt; violated their own code of conduct by publishing Sukhamaya Bain’s uncivil <br>
&gt; and objectionable posting, full of communal slur and personal attacks <br>
&gt; against me. <br>

Response : With due respect I would humbly disagree with your above statements. 
In fact, Mehul and other moderators are publishing both sides' view without 
being prejudicial. Indeed, there were some sarcasm (calling you &quot;islamic 
scholar&quot; etc.), but that hardly can be taken as &quot;personal attack&quot;, if you 
compare those shallow scribbles of NFB. Also mind that, your related articles 
also contain some words which some of the members found objectionable. MM did 
not restrict your view, rather published your view with due importance. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Mukto-Mona has also violated another avowed principle, set <br>
&gt; by its learned moderators, by publishing a posting, which is contextual to <br>
&gt; my recent posting in the NFB. Does Mukto-Mona mean what it asserts as its <br>
&gt; code of conduct? Anyway, this is none of my business.<br>
<br>
<br>
Response: Yes I agree with your point here, but rather partially. MM's guideline 
says, MM MAY not publish messages written primarily in response to articles 
posted in other forum (s). Recheck the word &quot;May&quot;, it does not say &quot;MUST&quot;. 
Infact the guideline also mentions that the moderation team has the final 
authority in deciding which messages would be posted and which wouldn't. So you 
most probably cannot blame moderator for violation of guideline. I am not sure 
why moderator decided to post it, but one thing I must point out. You also 
brought MM into NFB [rather irrelevantly]. Instead of refuting the author in our 
forum, you wrote in NFB...<br>
<br>
Quote [&quot;We have Tagore apologists everywhere, in every forum, print and 
electronic media both in South Asia and beyond. One of them (Mesbahuddin Jowher) 
in a recent posting to the Mukto-Mona on May 8, 2006 wrote an apologia for 
Tagore in Bengali, “Was Tagore a Communalist?” According to him, Tagore only 
toyed with Hindutva and anti-Muslim expressions up to the early 20th century and 
afterwards he was a changed man. This is not at all true.&quot;] Unquote<br>
<br>
I am not sure how much is relevant is reading an article from MM and refuting 
the author in NFB, especially when you know Mr. Jowher does not write in NFB. Of 
course you may also point out that your opponents also did the same. I think 
moderator would give a second thought before approving those posts forwarded 
from (or related to) other forums. Again, had the moderators restricted those 
posts, we would have missed the excellent debate. This is also true. <br>
Moderarors are human being. They make mistakes though they try to moderate the 
forum with sincerity. See, even today we've received a personal attack with 
irrelevant comment against our respected member Farida Majid. Moderators decided 
not to post that. As these things are not visible to everyone, moderators seldom 
receive any appreciation. <br>
<br>
For the rest of your message (which is mainly directed to Mr. Bain), I do not 
have any comment. <br>
