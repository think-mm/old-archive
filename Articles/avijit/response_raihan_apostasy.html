<p>Thanks Mehul for your information. I would like to add my 2 cents here!</p>
<p>I am a bit disappointed to read some of Raihan's latest pieces (especially 
his desperate attempts of defending Quran etc.), though in general I do not have 
any disrespect for him. Raihan is a concerned person for society which I very 
much appreciate, but sadly I found most of his write-ups are basically driven by 
emotion, instead of being logical or driven by hard facts. He also tries to draw 
his conclusion from a very limited number existing samples. Sometimes deep 
historical study is essential to come out such conclusion. Hope Raihan would not 
take my criticism personally. </p>
<p>Pardon me if I am looked a bit&nbsp; cynical here, his argument for seeking 
&quot;responsibility&quot; from the fellow apostates is kind a like similar to the voice 
of self-appointed male chauvinistic guardians, police officers or Matubbars of 
rural BD who virtually starts blaming an unfortunate woman after she got raped 
by local gundas. Their arguments are typical. - why not that woman wear decent 
dress, why she did not wear hijab, why she have to walk alone in late night 
coming from work, why she did not show more decency or politeness while the 
goondas approached to her etc. etc. Such &quot;responsibility&quot; argument is basically 
nothing but advising in a crude way - &quot;Hey, when rape is inevitable, lets enjoy 
it rather than protest!&quot; Raihan's argument is also kind a similar (though he did 
not say it directly)-- &quot;Hey, when you leave Islam keep your filthy mouth shut!&quot;
</p>
<p>Raihan's advice for apostates is against the basic human rights and freedom 
of expression. Amnesty International points out clearly that -</p>
<p>The right to freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed by international 
and regional treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19 of ICCPR says :</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>1. Everyone have rights to hold opinions without interference. </i></p>
  <p><i>Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
  include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all 
  kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the 
  form of art, or any other media of his choice. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Raihan's inane statement - &quot;I have hardly heard any Ulema has ever 
issued any Fatwa on any apostate who leaves Islam and leads a normal life&nbsp; 
Afghani Abdur Rahman’s case might be an exception, who knows.&quot;&nbsp; clearly 
shows his ignorance (sorry if I sounded harsh) in the topic being discussed. 
That is the reason I pointed&nbsp; out in the beginning a thorough historical 
study is required to draw such conclusion. Indeed there are many evidences 
besides&nbsp; that Afghani Abdur Rahman in Islamic history.&nbsp; One recent 
example is Mohammad Omer Haji of Yemen who was converted to Christianity and 
adopted a name &quot;George&quot; around 1994. [<a href="http://www.rim.org/muslim/yemen.htm">http://www.rim.org/muslim/yemen.htm</a> 
] He did not abuse anyone, but just for his &quot;crime&quot; of conversion, he was 
imprisoned in January 2000 and reportedly beaten and threatened for two months 
by Yemeni Govt officials. After his arrest, he was formally put into trial in 
June for apostasy under Article 259 of Yemen criminal law. Raihan probably is 
not realizing the impact that&nbsp; apostasy is a capital offence under muslim 
laws enforced in Yemen and some other countries. </p>
<p>Such cases are many. I can also site well-known Egyptian feminist&nbsp; Nawal 
al Saadawi's example. Just because of her criticism of Islamic law of 
inheritance (which sates women should receive only half of the property of what 
a man does) in a newspaper <i>al-Miidan</i>, she was branded as &quot;apostate&quot;, and 
a fatwa was issued that her divorce should be taken place. </p>
<p>Apparently Raihan is disturbed by Apostate's &quot;harsh criticism&quot; of Allah 
Muhammad etc. This is what he says - &quot;However, what some people are doing is 
that they not only leave Islam but also they try their utmost to abuse Muhammad, 
Muslims, Allah, etc! It is still OKAY!&quot;</p>
<p>So does Raihan think its NOT OK and who will decide about the standard 
whether the criticism is &quot;utmost abuse&quot; or not? He should have read&nbsp; The 
great Humanist Thomas Paine's utterance about Bible - &quot;...The Bible is a book 
lies, wickedness and Blasphemy. As for the book called Bible, it is actually 
blasphemy to call it the word of god. ...This book is too ridiculous even for 
criticism&quot; ( Ref. The age of reason; Thomas Paine, p 88). Raihan should also 
read Bertrand Russel's &quot;Why I am not a Christian&quot; or James Harvey Johnson's 
criticism about Jesus or Bible. Many scholars even portrayed Jesus as Gay, 
pervert, rapist or maniac etc. No body had saught head for Russell, Harvey or 
Pane. Nobody said that they cant criticize Jesus or Bible as long as they do not 
belong to Christianity. Nobody tried to put any self-defined &quot;standard&quot; of 
&quot;utmost abuse&quot; or &quot;criticism&quot;.&nbsp; Such judgment is obviously relative.&nbsp; 
We think society got benefited from their criticism (or abasement whatever you 
say), no matter whether they belong to Christianity or not.&nbsp; Apostasy is no 
&quot;quantum jump&quot;, in most of the cases it a gradual realization about the 
hypocrisy of religious faith.&nbsp; Muslim apostates should not be alienated, 
rather rational people should stand by them.&nbsp; </p>
