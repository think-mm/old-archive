<p>Here is my response to Raihan :</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>Raihan [&gt;Thanks, Avijit, for your comments.<br>
<br>
&gt;I DO agree that the description in religious scriptures on any issue CANNOT be 
called scientific (I have already said the <br>
&gt;same in some of my write-ups), as the 
scriptures were not written based on any sort of scientific experiment, neither 
can <br>
&gt;they be verified by scientific experiments now. However, I am not so SURE 
about what ID'istic view on evolution or <br>
&gt;anything else in that matter.] </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Response : Thanks for the agreement. <br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p>[Raihan : &gt;But the thing is that, because of the ongoing conflict between 
Atheistic and ID'istic evolutionists, they carefully <br>
&gt;select some &quot;terms&quot; to suit 
their own belief! It sounds like they are more prone to their personal belief 
than investigating <br>
&gt;the FACT!]</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Response : One can judge the above statement as the poster's own 
belief too. And most importantly there is no term called 'ID'istic evolutionists'. The conflict I 
know is between 'evolution' and 'intelligent design' (or creationism).<br>
</font><br>
[Raihan :&gt;On one hand, Atheistic evolutionists select some terms like &quot;emerged&quot;, &quot;evolve&quot;, 
etc to avoid the term &quot;creation&quot; <br>
&gt;as they are in conflict with the creationists! 
On the other hand, the ID'istic evolutionists are also choosing some terms like 
<br>
&gt;&quot;creation&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot;, &quot;design&quot;, etc to suit their own agenda. Most of the 
people believe what they say! Therefore, it is <br>
&gt;very difficult to separate the FCAT from fiction from this kind of conflict.]</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Response: For the fact you have to read scientific journals and 
scientific books, you just don't have to depend on your own intuition. Just show me one 
scientific journal paper deals with 'creation' (of life) and 'creation myths'. 
It has been repeatedly stated that science 
depends on natural explanation, not supernatural, probably you are not getting 
the message.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge Overton in 1981 Akansas trial very precisely 
summarized why 'creation science' is NOT a science by explaining what science is 
:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">1. It is guided by natural law.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">2. It has to be explanatory by reference of natural law</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">3. It is testable against empirical world</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">4. Its conclusions are tentative</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">5. It is falsifiable.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Did you find one single exception in anyone's 
scientific research? Kindly check your own research. Did you give any 
&quot;supernatural reference&quot; in your PhD thesis? Did you quote any &quot;holy verse&quot; from 
any scripture in literature study that has strengthen&nbsp; your academic 
research? Do you know anybody who does and gets his academic degree? </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Forget about science, even in everyday life we depend 
on natural explanations. For example, for investigating a plane crash, federal 
agencies should consider the possibility of mechanical failure, or a bomb 
carried by a terrorist on board, or a missile impact etc, not supernatural 
intervention. If our hose is robbed we go to police to investigate and find out 
the criminal, not the supernatural &quot;jeen bhut&quot; etc. </font></p>
<p><br>
[Raihan : &gt;Now the basic questions are: Where did something emerge from? Where did 
something evolve from? Atheistic <br>
&gt;evolutionists have NO answer of these 
questions.]</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Response: Where (should be how?) did something emerge [out of 
nothing] is not a biological question, it belong to the realm of physics. Do you 
have any slightest idea where modern physics has gone these days? The origin of matter has been well 
explained thru current 'cosmic inflation' theory. suggested by Alan Guth and Linde.&nbsp; Alan 
Guth has also written a book for general readers : &quot;The inflationary Universe&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
once referred the book to Raihan once, but it looks he did not care at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Here are some other papers from sceintific journal that has explained the&nbsp; 
topic in detail:</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;E.P. Tryon, &quot;Is the Universe as 
Qunatum Fluctuation?&quot;, Nature 246 (1973): 396-97. David Atkatz and Heinz Pagels, 
&quot;Origin of universe as Quantum Tunneling effect&quot; Physical review D25 (1982): 
2065-73; S.W. Hawking and I.G.Moss &quot;Supercolled Phase Transitions in the very 
early Universe&quot;, Physics letters B110(1982):35-38; Alexander Vilenkin, &quot;Creation 
of Universe from Nothing&quot; Physics letters 117B (1982) 25-28, Andre Linde, 
&quot;Quantum creation of the inflamatory Universe,&quot; Letter Al Nuovo Cimento 
39(1984): 401-405 etc.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Origin of matter and origin of life is two different 
thing. Nobody denies that the origin of life is an extremely difficult problem 
for today's scientists. 
That it has not been fully solved, though, does not mean it is impossible in future. 
In fact, there has been much work in this area, leading to several possible 
origins for life on earth. One of the first scientists to suggest that life 
originated from inanimate chemicals was the Russian biochemist A. I Operin whose 
pioneering work with coacervate droplets was done in early 20's.&nbsp; In 1953 
in a very simple test Stanle Miller and Harold Urey validated Oparin's 
hypothesis 
by forming aminoacid, urea, and several fatty acid from non-organic molecule in 
prebiotic environment. Since his first experiment, Miller and others have 
experimented with other atmospheric compositions, too (Chang et al. 1983; Miller 
1987; Schlesinger and Miller 1983; Stribling and Miller 1987). Complex organic 
molecules form under a wide range of periodic conditions. Later another 
researcher Sydney Fox was able to plymerize the amino acids in a sun warmed 
surface. When those polymers later came to contact with water they form 
protonoid microsphere. They can &quot;grow&quot;, by absorbing more protinoid material. 
They can also move and form buds like those east and bacteria. These protinoid 
microspheres show osmotic and selective diffusion properties that shared with 
living cells. Not only this, the fossilized microspheres are indistinguishable 
from the earliest known microfossils that date back to about 3.5 BYA (Ref. 
Evolution and creationism myth, Prof. Tim Berra, p 75-76). These protinoids are called as &quot;proto-cells&quot;.&nbsp; Basically they 
fill the role of the most primitive type of cell having properties of life (Ref. 
The emergence of life, Sydney Fox). Many scientists suggested pre-RNA world too 
for replication and these RNA led to more complicated DNA replicator today. ULCA 
paleobiologist Willium Scope uttered, &quot;We know the overall sequence of life's 
origin from CHONSP [carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus]&nbsp; 
to monomers, polymers to cells; we know that the origin of life was early, 
microbial and unicelluler; and we know that an RNA world preceded today's 
DNA-protein world.&quot; Besides this 'theory of chemical evolution' of life, 
scientists also did not rule out another possibility - Panspermia, which says 
life came from someplace other than earth. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Raihan, have you read any of the scientific papers or 
related books dealing with origin of life or just vaguely throwing your comments 
like &quot;Atheistic evolutionists have NO answer of these questions&quot;? Kindly read 
the research papers instead of trying to 'poke hole' in science' and putting your 
&quot;God&quot; in it.&nbsp; Scientist are aware that there are some 'gaps' (for example 
they do not know precisely about the environment of early earth, or not sure 
about what is the origin of complex life or still arguing on if DNA comes from 
RNA, what is the first replicator that become RNA etc.) in solving the puzzle but at least they are 
trying to solve the puzzle in a scientific way without invoking any 
&quot;supernatural deity&quot;. Just look at the past 100 years of scientific 
advancement and you will see that scientists 
were indeed able to solve many such puzzles which were thought to be impossible. For 
anything explained by&nbsp; science was&nbsp; thought to be guided by supernatural causes indeed. 
For example it was not known before Newton how earth hangs upon nothing in space 
circling around the sun. Many people must have thought of a mysterious 
&quot;supernatural force&quot; behind it. However, Newton's gravitational law explained it 
very clearly. Ancient people even did not know the mechanism behind rainfall 
too. They 'created' the deity like 'Mikayel Feresta' or 'Indra' to explain it. 
However scientists now are able to explain the event through water cycle.&nbsp; 
The 'mystery' behind origin of life will be indeed solved by scientists no doubt 
without invoking supernatural, and this is what science always does. We depend 
on scientific research and explanations, and we know science has proven it's 
ability in the past - because it works!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;[Raihan : &gt;But science doesn't deal with these kinds of &quot;NO answer&quot; events. 
Science deals with matter and energy. <br>
&gt;Where there is NOTHING, there is NO 
scientific research at all. Therefore, from scientific point of view itself, 
evolution <br>
&gt;MUST be started from &quot;something&quot;. What is that &quot;something&quot;? Well, 
people may call it &quot;creation&quot; (please do not mis-<br>
&gt;understand) if they wish; 
because scientists CANNOT create anything from NOTHINGNESS and something <br>
&gt;CANNOT 
be emerged/evolved from NOTHINGNESS either! But the point is that the Atheistic 
evolutionists are trying <br>
&gt;to avoid this important issue because of their personal 
belief, although it should have NO relation with theism or atheism <br>
&gt;in TRUE sense 
(NOT based on scriptures).] </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Response: Kindly see the answer above.&nbsp; We were 
talking about the theory of evolution only. The theory of evolution applies as 
long as life exists. How that life came to exist is not relevant to evolution. 
So evolution does not work on &quot;nothingness&quot;, but on genetic varieties of 
existing species. Claiming that evolution does not apply &quot;where there is 
nothing&quot; makes as much sense as saying that umbrellas do not work without a 
theory of meteorology. Kindly check the misconception :</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">This is not true that scientists cannot answer the 
questions of origin of life, but what I am saying is that it falls under 
different branch of science. </font></p>
<p> <br>
<br>
[Raihan : Another point is that how do the scientists make sure that the natural 
selection is INDEED blind? Is it just a <br>
&gt;belief? Why can't it be driven by 
“something”? If everything is running blindly and randomly without any prior 
decision <br>
&gt;then how do people make plan for years and work accordingly!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Response : Natural selection is the process by which individual 
organisms with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce than 
those with unfavorable traits. In each generation, only some individuals will 
produce offspring themselves, and of those that reproduce, some will leave more 
offspring than others. We can think of this as the &quot;natural” process of 
selection of individuals to reproduce. Individuals with beneficial traits are 
more likely to be 'selected' than individuals with other traits. When those 
traits have a heritable component, they tend to become more common in the next 
generation. The mechanism of selection of individuals in a population does not 
&quot;know&quot; which traits are heritable; in this sense, the mechanisms of selection 
are &quot;blind&quot;.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">There are many good examples of &quot;blindness&quot; of natural 
selection. One example is evolution of feather in early bird. Dylan Evans and 
Howard Selina in their basic book &quot;Introducing Evolution&quot;&nbsp; (Icon books, UK) 
wrote :</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">&quot;Natural selection has no foresight. When feathers 
first evolved, this was not in order to prepare the way for the evolution of 
wings. Feathers just happened to evolve for one reason, and it so happened that 
this provided the material for the evolution of wings.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">There are lot other examples. One good example is 
Sickle cell anemia which is a nearly lethal condition in humans, responsible for 
about 100, 000 deaths a year. About 80% of individuals with this condition die 
before reproducing. Yet despite such apparently strong selection against the 
gene responsible for sickle cell hemoglobin, it is maintained at frequencies of 
10% or even more in Africa. This is because &quot;this disease&quot; is proven 
to be more resistant to 
malaria than normal person (without Sickle cell anemia) there. In Africa malaria 
is very dominating, and thus Sickle cell anemia survives in those African&nbsp; 
sates, because &quot;blind natural selection&quot; played a vital role. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Richard Dawkins wrote a nice basic book &quot;Blind 
Watchmaker&quot; on Natural selection and&nbsp; there this is what he defines Natural 
selection : </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">&quot;Natural selection, the unconscious, automatic, blind 
process that Darwin discovered, has no purpose in 
mind. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the 
blind watchmaker.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Kindly do not think Richard Dawkin wrote just a &quot;unproven&quot; story book. 
In developing the argument that blind natural selection can explain the complex 
adaptations of organisms, he demonstrated by the example of the Weasel program. 
Dawkins then describes his experiences with a more sophisticated computer model 
of artificial selection implemented in a program also called The Blind 
Watchmaker.&nbsp; Read the book&nbsp; 
you will find all the answer. </font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">There is no relation with 'how do people make plan for 
years and work accordingly' with biological natural selection. How people will 
plan or work will not depend on 'natural selection'.&nbsp;&nbsp;His statement 
shows Raihan has no idea on the subject that he is throwing his 'opinion'.&nbsp; 
Natural selection does not intervenes in social life, just like Einstein's 
theory of relativity has anything to do to chose my color of shoes that I wear.&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected the 
poster should have primary knowledge on the topic. Unfortunately Raihan is 
arguing without reading any basic books on evolution. I am afraid that he does 
not hold any clear idea about the terms 'creation', 'purpose', 'design', 
'evolution', 'natural selection' etc. His whole motive is to argue with his 'intuition' and 'common sense'. We 
know what common sense is. It's the human faculty and 'common sense' that tells 
us that Earth is flat. objective observation, on the other hand, tells us that 
earth is round. Rihan must study the subject before coming to debate on 
scientific topic in this forum.</font>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&gt;Raihan : [Moreover, there are lots of processes in the universe that are 
running deterministically for millions of years the <br>
&gt;way they started...] </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Response: There are many random process in nature too. One 
example is non-causal nature of quantum phenomena in atomic particles. Another 
example is the 
radioactive decay of an atomic nucleus by which an alpha, beta, or gamma particle begins 
to exist spontaneously, and randomly. Quantum fluctuation is also a known 
phenomenon which is not 'deterministic'.&nbsp;Ever heard the 'random mutation'?&nbsp;This 
is also not deterministic.&nbsp; These are all scientifically 
proven facts.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Many of the members advised Raihan to read basic books 
on the very technical subjects (like evolution, astrophysics) etc. before making 
comments. At least latest issues of Scientific American and National Geographics 
would have helped him a lot to understand modern research in physics and biology. But unfortunately he is very dependent on creationist 
web-site, popular myths and own flawed intuition, which has been refuted by 
scientists many times. &nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
