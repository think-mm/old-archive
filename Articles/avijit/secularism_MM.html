	<p><span style="font-family: Arial">In response, I </span>
	<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">
	<O:P>&nbsp;sent&nbsp; a short message to the forum; here elaborating in 
	details:&nbsp;</O:P> </span></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I don't think the word &quot;secularism&quot; 
	or &quot;secular&quot; has been wrongly used on the MM site. SECULARISM, in my 
	opinion, in dealing with the social problems of the day, relies upon human 
	reason, not upon &quot;divine&quot; faith; upon fact, not upon fiction; upon 
	experience, not upon a supposed supernatural revelation. It can discover no 
	value in what are termed spiritual proposals as a remedy for existing evils. 
	Hence, Secularists can recognize only that as being socially useful which 
	tends to the physical, mental, moral, and political improvement of mankind 
	as members of the general commonwealth. Thus, The dictionary definition &quot;not 
	religious: not religious or spiritual in nature&quot; does not seem to contradict 
	with the mission that MM has taken. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You may feel that some articles in 
	our site perhaps do not fall under a &quot;strict&quot; definition of &quot;secularism&quot;, 
	but to me they are not &quot;anti- secular&quot; either. Many progressive sites are 
	using the word &quot;secular&quot;, though they mainly support as leading 
	organizations for non- religious people i.e. freethinkers. For e.g, </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i><b>The Internet Infidels</b></i>, 
	a widely popular organization who are using the Internet exclusively to 
	promote agnosticism, atheism, freethought, and metaphysical naturalism. The 
	name of their web-site is &quot;Secular Web&quot;. Check : </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><a href="http://www.infidels.org">
	http://www.infidels.org</a>&nbsp; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Also check : Paul Kurtz's web site -
	<i><b>Council for Secular Humanism</b></i> that promotes rational, 
	human-based viewpoints on important social and ethical issues. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
	<a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/">http://www.secularhumanism.org/</a>&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above two sites deal with a lot 
	of religious articles and eventually promote naturalistic or more 
	specifically, &quot;anti-religious&quot; view-points. But that does not restrict them 
	for being secular, hence the name of their sites, i.e, <i>secular web</i> or
	<i>secularhumanism.org</i> should be quite self-explanatory to all.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, in Bangladesh, (to be 
	precise in sub-continent) we use the word quite differently (read wrongly) 
	if its original (root) meaning is to be considered. The &quot;secular&quot; leaders of 
	our country contradict the essential motto of &quot;secularism&quot; in each and every 
	action. I will cite some examples for the erudite readers in this article. 
	But before going there, let's discuss some necessary aspects of politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Politics, according to my opinion, 
	should be wholly secular i.e non-religious by nature. Politics means solving 
	people's problems through a government. The institution of government is 
	maintained by the taxes which people pay and by the co-operation which 
	people give. If a government functions properly, people can have their 
	problems of food, comfort or security solved easily. Indeed that is the 
	purpose which a government should fulfill. A government would discharge its 
	duties well if it were allowed to be secular. But the interference of 
	religious belief and spiritual considerations with the functions of a 
	government, foils the purpose. When people's attention is divided between 
	god and government, they are more habituated to raise their hands in prayer 
	to god for food and peace than to hold the ways of their government 
	responsible for unemployment and insecurity. Our politicians need the thrust 
	of &quot;religious sentiment&quot; to fool people, as they know faith in politics 
	provides easy explanations for all phenomena and can be used as a weapon to 
	silence the restless inquisitiveness of &quot;ignorant people&quot;; clever 
	politicians are therefore, interested to transfer the demand of common mass 
	towards heaven, rather than putting in an effort to solve those in this 
	mundane world. We frequently hear sermons like &quot;Allar Mal Allay Niye gechey&quot; 
	(Allah has taken back his own creation) from the mouths of our reputed 
	ministers either on the incident of killing of a kid by stray bullet or 
	after a massive accident that carries hundreds of human lives. Our 
	politicians are greedy; they are motivated towards money, power and use the 
	vote of the ignorant masses, and hence they try to establish a wrong 
	interpretation of secularism. Even the so-called &quot;secular&quot; party, Awami 
	Leage put &quot;Allah Sharbo-shoktimaan&quot; (Allah is all-powerful) in the top of 
	any of their leaflets, web-sites etc. [<a href="http://www.albd.org/">http://www.albd.org/</a>]. 
	Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, first President of Bangladesh who was popularly 
	recognized as Bangabandhu (Friend of Bengal) and father of the nation 
	revived the Islamic Academy (which was banned in 1972 due to their 
	collaboration with Pakistani army during liberation war) and upgraded it to 
	a Foundation (in March 1975) and increasingly attended many of the Islamic 
	gatherings. It can be mentioned that in its early days especially at the 
	party's third council meeting held in Dhaka on 21-23 October 1955, the same 
	Awami League showed the courage to drop out the word 'Muslim' from the name 
	of the party to make it sound secular. However, the sprit of secularism and 
	courage was not maintained by later Awami leaders. Towards the end of his 
	rule, Mujib made frequent references to Islam in his speeches and public 
	utterances by using terms and idioms which were peculiar mainly to the 
	Islam-oriented Bangladeshi - like Allah (the Almighty God), Insha Allah (God 
	willing), Bismillah (in the name of God), Tawaba (Penitence) and Imam 
	(religious leader). As the days passed, Sheikh Mujib even dropped his 
	symbolic valedictory expression Joy Bangla and ended his speeches with Khuda 
	Hafez, the traditional Indo-Islamic phrase for bidding farewell. The process 
	of using Islam to uproot secularism gathered huge momentum during the 
	military regimes of General Ziaur Rahman (1975-1981) and General H.M. Ershad 
	(1982-1990). During the regime of Zia, his party, BNP scraped secularism 
	from the four state principles and inserted &quot;Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim&quot; (in 
	the name of Allah, the beneficent, the merciful) in our constitution. The 
	principle of secularism was replaced by the words, &quot;Absolute trust and faith 
	in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all action.&quot; Between 1982 and 
	1990, General Ershad made systematic efforts to continue the policy of Zia, 
	rehabilitating anti-liberation elements and the parallel Islamisation 
	culminating in the disputable Eighth amendment to the Constitution declaring 
	&quot;Islam&quot; as a state religion. Our current prime minister Khaleda Zia and 
	former Prime minister Sheikh Hasina both used religion as a tool to 
	consolidate their power base following their forefathers.</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In India we see the same thing. The 
	42<sup>nd</sup> amendment to the Constitution introduced by Mrs. Indira 
	Gandhi, the then Prime Minister, reiterated the secular character declaring 
	India as a &quot;socialist, secular, democratic state&quot;. The Fundamental Duties 
	incorporated into the Constitution through the same Amendment make it the 
	responsibility of every citizen to strive for the promotion of &quot;the spirit 
	of enquiry&quot;, scientific outlook, humanism and reform. The constitution of 
	India, also abolished untouchability and its practice in any form was 
	prohibited. Special preferences in the name of religion do not exist as per 
	their constitution. However, in practice, such a spirit has never been 
	followed. The controversies of <i>Ram Janma-Bhoomi</i> and <i>Babri Masjid</i>, 
	religious clashes in different parts of the country including Gujarat, 
	Casteism, communalism, discrimination against dalits revealed the 
	hypocritical view of &quot;equal respect&quot; type secularism that is being practiced 
	in India with &quot;utmost sincerity&quot;. The fundamentalist forces fan the passion 
	and emotion of the masses and distract attention from the real issues of 
	economic and social development. Evil character Narendra Modi increased his 
	popularity through religious riots - it’s an open secret for quite sometime 
	now. Recently Kanchan Gupta, wrote an article in Rediff - May 09, 2005, 
	&quot;Secular? That's a laugh&quot; :</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">&quot;Every time secular India has demanded that the 
		system of personal laws based on religious injunctions should be done 
		away with, that Article 44 of the Constitution of India which enjoins 
		upon the government to adopt a Uniform Civil Code should be taken for 
		what it was meant to be, a cornerstone of State policy in a modern 
		nation state, a countervailing cry has gone up, alleging that it is an 
		assault on the identity of minority communities. That, of course, is a 
		misnomer; what those opposed to a Uniform Civil Code mean is that the 
		State should not interfere with retrograde personal laws that 
		discriminate on grounds of gender, laws which are not in tune with the 
		social realities of the 21st century. The best example of such laws is 
		the Muslim personal law that remains unaltered in sum and substance 
		despite vacuous words of assurance by leading lights of the ulema....</p>
		<p align="justify">The(ir) logic is simple: Secular courts do not have 
		the authority to either interpret or apply sharia, which is based on the 
		Quran and the Hadith. That right belongs to 'sharia courts' alone. As 
		much was stated at the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board's conference 
		in Bhopal when the members encouraged Muslims to take their differences 
		to 'sharia courts' -- as distinct from going to the local ulema or alim 
		as was the practice till now. <font face="Verdana">&nbsp;....</font></p>
		<p align="justify">So, we have a fast-unfolding situation where the 
		All-India Muslim Personal Law Board is setting up sharia courts as a 
		parallel system of justice. By the time authority in secular India wakes 
		up to this reality, the government will be presented with a <i>fait 
		accompli</i>-- accept it, or be damned as anti-Muslim. And let there be 
		no doubt: Government will accept the sharia courts lest it upsets 
		India's progressive, secular activists. &quot;</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Kanchan Gupta is right. Its a farce 
	to call a country secular if it allows a Sharia Court as a parallel system 
	of justice. Hence we understand that true spirit of secularism has never 
	been realized nor followed in India. However, we think proper interpretation 
	of &quot;secularism&quot; is not only a desired goal but it is the very breath of a 
	nation. But what is that &quot;true spirit of secularism&quot; that we are talking 
	about?</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A secular state is not supposed to 
	have its own religion. It could not discriminate between its citizens on the 
	basis of religion. State authorities would keep themselves off from 
	attending religious functions. It would not favor any one religion. This 
	concept goes on and on adding many ‘nots’. These values of 'nots' are the 
	main spirit of Secularism that paraded by Western scholars as a magnificent 
	gift to our civilization. However, the meaning had been changed by the 
	Morarji Desai government, while he implemented &quot;secularism&quot; in India - 
	changing its original content to ambiguous - ‘equal respect to all 
	religions’. This view has been popularized among people in sub-continent 
	lately. Our renowned scholar Ms Farida Majid feels proud in preserving such 
	an ‘<b>equal respect to all religions and cultures</b>’ kind of secularism 
	in her breath. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Farida Majid should not be 
	considered as an isolated case here. Many of &quot;non-communal&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; 
	thinkers like her nowadays erroneously think that just being equally 
	respectful towards all the religion (<i>SARVADHARMA-SAMABHAV</i>) makes a 
	person &quot;secular&quot;. Look at the politics in Bangladesh and India. Our prime 
	Minster, oppsition leaders and MPs are all proud of portraying themselves as 
	&quot;secular&quot; to make use of the involvement of the state into politics quite 
	frequently, by performing religious rituals such as taking Jumma Prayer or 
	Mazar Jiyarat (of course with TV cameras in the back), taking part 
	ininauguration ceremonies of mosques or temples, conducting recitations from 
	the Quran on the eve of several cultural and even state activities, donating 
	funds for Durga puja, Eid and other religious activities, taking blessing 
	from Atroshi, Saidabadi, Shai Baba on the eve of election - all eventually 
	violates the ethos of a secular nation. Such &quot;secularism&quot; has played havoc 
	in the polity. The word is misused for Vote Bank Politics. Further the 
	misuse of the word has been propagated by our famous politicians - &quot;Dhormo-niropekkhota 
	maney dhormo-heenota noy&quot; (Being secular does not mean anti-Religious). 
	True, secularism does not encourage you to be an &quot;atheist&quot;, however, it does 
	not encourage you to be &quot;religious&quot; either; rather what secularism demands 
	is complete indifference in religious activities. The bottom line is, 
	religion should be essentially distinct from Government, and exempt from its 
	cognizance; that &quot;a connection between them is injurious to both&quot; [quotation 
	taken from Robert S. Alley, ed., James Madision on Religious Liberty, pp. 
	37-94.]. This is what our political leaders will never utter, nor follow. 
	Only few writers, I have found from the subcontinent are able to come out 
	with clear view on &quot;Secularism&quot; so far. Prabir Ghosh, Bhabani Prashad Sahu, 
	Prof. Jayanti Patel are some of them. Let me quote few paragraphs from 
	Prabir Ghosh's monumental work, &quot;Shongshkriti - Shonghorsho O Nirman&quot; (Page 
	228), - one of my favorites:</font></p>
	<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="dhormoniropekkhota.jpg" width="549" height="468"></font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">[Translation (<i>by Abul Kasem</i>):
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify">Thanks to the massive media propaganda, the common 
		people are now fully familiar with the word ‘secularism’. They are 
		currently aware that secularism means ‘equal rights to all religions’. 
		Our government spends enormous sums of money to propagate this import of 
		secularism. In connection with this policy of the government, our 
		ministers, bureaucrats and politicians are roaming around Hindu temples 
		offering worship, prostrating at Gurduwaras (Sikh temples) and 
		demonstrating full devotion at mosques and churches. Statesmen are on 
		the air and television to offer good-will on the occasions of Diwali, 
		Eid, Christmas….etc. Money is made available to the religious 
		organizations in the form of exemption from income tax. </p>
		<p align="justify">The laity likes this. They are satisfied that, in 
		accordance with the principle of 'equal rights for all religions' the 
		ministers, the bureaucrats and the politicians kneel down to the power 
		of religion. As well, they are happy to have the feelings of liberality 
		and tolerance. Their attitude is: “Look, how secular our country is. 
		Here all religions enjoy equal right and respect with our ministers and 
		bureaucrats” Taking advantage of this mindset of the common people, our 
		ministers are exhorting to keep aloft the torch of secularism. </p>
		<p align="justify">Words fail to describe how amazingly the lay people 
		are brain washed by this terrible misinterpretation of the concept of 
		secularism. The true meaning of neutrality is: having no bias for any 
		side. Thus, the connotation of secularism is not to be on the side of 
		any religion at all; that is, abandonment of any relation with religion. 
		The dictionary definition of secularism is: it is a concept which 
		postulates that policies, such as state, education etc should be free 
		from religious injunctions. </p>
		<p align="justify">But lo! What a surprise when we behold the affairs 
		that are going on in the name of secularism. Even during secular state 
		ceremonies religious rites are observed. Come the inauguration of a 
		venture, or the laying of foundation of a project, we note the 
		incantation of verses, lighting of lamps, oblation of flower wreaths or 
		the rendering of coconuts. This is how the businessmen of politics are 
		upholding their trade, by extolling the slogan of harmony and integrity 
		with all religions, peddling this as secularism.]</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Prof. Jayanti Patel, touching on 
	&quot;Indian version&quot; of Secularism 
	in his piece, &quot;<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/human_rights/gujarat/gujrat_riot_patel.html">India: Gujarat 
	riots - communalization of state and civic society</a>&quot; wrote the following:
	</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">&quot;Our interpretation of 
		secular as SARVADHARMA-SAMABHAV, protecting every religion and their 
		diverse mode of belief structure, their separate social and civil code, 
		varied customs, mores and faiths, and even education system is not 
		conducive in building an integrated national society or human identity. 
		Our identity is basically communal and has proved to be an obstruction 
		in building a nation- state. It is clear that in interpreting the 
		meaning of the word secular we have disregarded the spirit of the 
		enlightenment and renaissance which was instrumental in building a 
		modern state and the civic society in the west. It seems that we have to 
		interpret the correct meaning of the word secular in our law 
		enforcement. <b>The connotation of the word secular should mean negation

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;The connotation of the word secular 
	should mean negation of all religions&quot; - I personally feel that his opinion 
	of secularism fits with the view that MM tries to uphold. We have to be 
	strong in our mission stating clearly that &quot;secularism&quot;, by its own 
	definition, is <b>neither &quot;tolerance&quot; nor &quot;respect&quot;</b> towards all 
	religions (the way it has been practiced in subcontinent), but it is the <b>
	total denial </b>of involvement in religious activities from the state, a 
	complete, not partial: it is the emergence of homogeneous human outlook 
	which is based upon verifiable facts of life, not fiction. Such a correct 
	outlook is an urgent need in our society. </font></p>
