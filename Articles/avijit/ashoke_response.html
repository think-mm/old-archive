<p>Nowadays I try to avoid responding to such useless thread on religion, however, Mr Ashok Kumawat's 
very 
superficial response to the scholarly write-up of Mr. Narandra Nath compelled me 
to write something on this issue.&nbsp; Here is my point by point rebuttal.</p>
<p>[Ashok]</p>
<p>The fundamental and serious mistake done by the writer of this article is 
Understanding of scriptures in Illogical way.</p>
<p>[Response]</p>
<p>Amusingly, I found quite opposite. I found plain honesty and accuracy in Ramendra Nath's 
arguments while he targeted&nbsp; not just Hindu fundamentalism vaguely, but 
questions boldly against the oppressive verses of the dogma (Hinduism) itself. 
No doubt his write-up is the honest, rational and analytical criticism of 
Hinduism and its tenets. We can cite numerous incidents from the past like widow burning, cast 
problem, discrimination towards women in traditional hindu law or even very 
recent example of Babri Masjid demolition along with Gujarat riot that served as the 
eye-opener for exposing the real face of Vedic fanaticism time to time. Like 
many of the islamists, the apologists of Hinduism also dishonestly&nbsp; put a 
blame-game on `Hindu fundamentalists' like Advani, Bajpeyee, or RSS by insisting 
that the those radical extremism had nothing to do with real Hinduism - 
&quot;Hinduism is tolerant&quot; they always claimed, &quot;Hinduism is all-encompassing, etc.&quot;&nbsp; 
[ see ... Islamists also claim in the similar tone that Bin Laden, Al-Quaeda or 
Jamat has nothing to do with their &quot;peaceful Islam&quot;]. How hollow these claims 
while an honest scrutiny of hateful Hindu scriptures (Vedas, Manushanghita etc.) 
or Islamic scriptures (Quran and Hadith etc) with a rational mind exposes 
nakedly the real source of fundamentalism to all. How can one be silent and 
blame solely the fundamentalists while &quot;holy scripture&quot; itself suggests that Shudras are not entitled to philosophical knowledge or&nbsp; Shudras as well as 
women of dwija varnas are denied the right to study Vedas? Ramadranath has done 
a splendid job in scrutinizing the hateful dogma and pointing his finger, no 
doubt!</p>
<p>[Ashok]</p>
<p>Take one example- He defines the Varna-Vyavastha as Birth-Based. But that si 
totally against what said in Scriptures. The Varna-Vyavastha was TOTALLY based 
on Virtue and qualities (Gun-Karma-Swabhav). </p>
<p>[Response]</p>
<p>Really? Then please clarify why the hell &quot;all-loving&quot; Hindu God had to create 
Brahmins from mouth, Kshatriyas from hands, Vaishyas from thighs and Shudras 
from feet respectively? Why not creating Shudras from mouth and Bhrahmins from 
feet instead? Please note that apart than Manushanghita, the 
first reference to varna (class based on birth or caste) is to be found in the 
Purusha-Sukta of the Rig Veda too, and it was solely birth-based. Manusmriti 
states quite clearly that having originated from the mouth of Brahma, being 
elder and being the repository of the Vedas; Brahmins are the masters of the 
entire universe [MS I: 93,]. Please do not misinterpret the plain facts. </p>
<p>Again, If it is not birth-based, then, take this example - In Ramayana, Ram kills 
Shambuka, a Shudra simply because he was performing ascetic exercises which he 
was not supposed to do as he was a Shudra by birth. How funny! Where is your 
gun, karma, quality?</p>
<p>In Mahabharata, Dronacharya refuses to teach archery to Eklavya, because he 
was not a Kshatriya by birth. What a noble deed!</p>
<p>Quite expectedly you ignored these facts.</p>

<p>[Ashok]</p>
<p>I am giving here direct Proof and evidence to prove my statements above- 
According to- MANU 2: 28 &quot;A man does not become a Braahman because his body was 
the product of the reproductive .... these things go make a Braahman&quot; MANU 2: 
28.</p>
<p>One can see how the Varna-Vyvastha was based on (on birth or Qualities/Karma. 
And also he sanctions all four VARNAs to read VEDas and other scriptures 
equally. </p>
<p>[response]</p>
<p>Again apologetic interpretation. The verse you quoted is nothing but a lesson 
- &quot;how to be a good brahmin&quot; [and nothing else], however,&nbsp; despite your 
hard effort, you could not deny the facts - as per scripture, a Sudra has no 
right even to listen to the Veda. Recitation of or listening to this sacred book 
is exclusively a privilege of the Aryan Hindus, you know this right?&nbsp; You 
also know that a Brahman should never be the guru of a Sudra. A Sudra is 
debarred from marrying a woman of the higher castes. These are all explicitly 
stated in those &quot;holy scriptures&quot;. Any one who is concerned knows that Dalits 
(Untouchables), even today are the most pitiable victims of hindu society. 
According to Manu Smriti, 'Outcasted persons have no share in inheritance.' The 
orthodox Brahmans still believe, if the shadow of a Dalit falls on them, they 
are polluted and will have to purify them by sprinkling over themse1ves water 
from the holy river, the Ganges. These are just plain facts, don't just try to 
ignore bluntly. </p>
<p>[Ashoke]</p>
<p>The Four Varnas were totally Rational- to denote one's DUTY of life as per 
qualities. </p>
<p>[response] In this &quot;kali Jug&quot; even the most irrational people are allowed to&nbsp; 
use the prestigious word &quot;rational&quot; to defend their blind faith, eh?</p>
<p>[Ashoke]</p>
<p>Dear members, Even in practical life this is totally logical- If some person 
is more Qualified in trade/merchantship, let him call 'Vaishya' and let him him 
do that work as one of prime duty.</p>
<p>[Response] Hmm... I found the answer from Ramanda's original write-up. Take 
the example of Gandhi himself. He was a &quot;bania&quot; by caste. Yet, in spite of some 
serious aberrations such as supporting varna-vyavastha based on birth and 
linking politics with religion, he performed fairly well in the role of a 
national leader. It would have been a great loss for the nation if he literally 
followed your advise - &quot;let him call 'Vaishya' and let him him do that work as 
one of prime duty.&quot;. If Gandhi followed your advise, he would have been confined 
to running a grocery shop. </p>
