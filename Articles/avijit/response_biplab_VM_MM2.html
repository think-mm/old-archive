<p>BP&gt;&gt; How do I evaluate your statements in page5 &amp; 6 of the articles? What is 
the best description of these two page other than a criticism on American war 
crimes? </p>
<p>End of page 5 and beginning of page 6 is the clear indication that you think 
supporters of American Imperialism will be thrown into oblivion. You are not 
distinguishing among the supporters, cause of supports etc. Besides, it also 
means all the wars waged by the Americans are wrongful wars! </p>
<p>[Response]&nbsp; In Iraq,&nbsp; Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, Cambodia, 
Vietnam, Nicaragua, Columbia, El Salvador,&nbsp; Grenada countless civilians 
were indiscriminately killed by US invasion, bombing etc. Whatever &quot;cause of 
support&quot; you provide, truth remains just same. </p>
<p>[BP] I am repeatedly telling you that I am not criticizing what you wrote. I 
am no lover of American Foreign policy either. But it supports my statement that 
I made no factual error. We attribute an article based on its content and not on 
its tittle. </p>
<p>[Response] Unfortunately you did. You said in the previous post that he (Avijit) 
forced the issue that America should be equated with Islamic terrorist, which I 
actually did not. You are putting words in my mouth. What I suggested based on 
the gory details of US invasion, she should not be considered as &quot;the world's 
greatest force for peace&quot; or our &quot;savior&quot;. </p>
<p>[BP] End of page 5 and beginning of page 6, your statement is clearly against 
the people who are supporting the US war against terrorism ( or we may call it 
imperialism). Kuddus is admittedly one of those. What made you think that he 
will not react in his self-defense? </p>
<p>[Response] Just see :&nbsp; what made you think that Mohiuddin will not 
react in his self-defense when you defame his country's image? or&nbsp;&nbsp; 
what made you think that an Islamist will not react in his self-defense when you 
defame his &quot;religion of peace&quot;? You will find the answer here. Apologetic 
defense is emotional, not logical.&nbsp; </p>
<p>[BP] Kuddus was out of emotion as usual--I am condemning that too. But you 
never condemned the personal attack by Ananta and cheered him in support. </p>
<p>[Response] Your condemnation came only when Ananta's article has been 
published. Before that you kept silent. As if nothing happened then. To be 
frank,&nbsp; compared to Khan's, I did not find much personal attack in Ananta's 
piece, though I admit he used some strong language. I am not supporting it, but 
I also don't find any reason to condemn it as well, as his write-up came as a 
reaction. </p>
<p>[BP] I personally think Ananta's article was against the spirit of Mukto-mona.
</p>
<p>[Response]&nbsp; That's what is your opinion. Many members may not agree with 
this view. In fact many of the members of our forum thinks just opposite. They found Ananta's write-up 
as 
informative and highly accurate. They already expressed this view. You may 
differ. We have to live with that. </p>
<p>[BP] Kuddus did provide some numbers and economic theory which would have 
been refuted scientifically. Ananta took a humanist turn--which is not a proper 
rebuttal to the point. </p>
<p>[Response] Situation was just opposite. There was no &quot;economic theory&quot; in my 
write-up. It was Kuddus Khan who took a twisted turn, and tried to take us to 
economics as he thinks he is a &quot;specialist&quot; in this area. Ananta pulled him back 
to our original discussion of US aggression and interventionism towards the 
weaker counterparts. </p>
<p>[BP] He wanted to show how blind is Kuddus against American agrression with 
some events. He did that and then started a personal attack. </p>
<p>[Response] I disagree. Ananta just responded boldly to Mr. Khan's attack.</p>
<p>[BP] I expected that you would protest against Ananta' personal attack! Then 
Titu instead of providing any logic against my rebuttal sent a cartoon as if we 
are on American Payroll! How is that with true spirit of Mukto-mona? </p>
<p>[Response]&nbsp; Titu's opinion is entirely his. I did not follow his post.&nbsp; 
If he did any personal attack, he should have condemned.&nbsp; And many Cartoon 
was published in MM before, ridiculing Muhammad, Quran, Gita etc. Objection is 
being raised when only America is involved. </p>
<p>[BP] Under no condition personal attack on any writer should be tolerated. 
That should be the spirit. </p>
<p>[Response]&nbsp; I agree. However, personal attack has always been in MM, no 
matter how small it is. It sometimes goes beyond control. You may check your 
previous posts too. Remember,&nbsp; how 
you attacked Tushar Sarkar once mentioning his old age etc, and suggested that he 
has no place in future world. Your response was rude and I did not see you condemned 
though. Ananta's writeup is much milder in current context. </p>
<p>[BP] Anyhow, by unity I meant that activities of personal attacks against each 
other must be stopped! </p>
<p>[Response] Amen to Biplab at last!</p>
