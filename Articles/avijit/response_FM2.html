<p>Thanks Ms. Majid. I appreciate your comment. </p>
<p>As we both agree that policies, such as state, education etc should be free 
from religious injunctions,&nbsp; as per definition of secularism, we reached a 
common point here. I have no disagreement with your view at this level. Now I 
will elaborate my other point. </p>
<p>What I call&nbsp; &quot;preserving every form of faith and show respect&quot; is no 
secularism as&nbsp; I think that a compelling case may be made in support of the 
proposition that secularism is not a by-product of Christianity, Islam or any 
other religious faith as some have suggested, but remains instead very much the 
result of the Enlightenment Agenda. Secularism in its best sense is closely 
linked with other Enlightenment notions such as restraints on the power of 
autocratic and authoritarian states, and an affirmation of the value of the 
scientific enterprise, reason, logic, and the Idea of Progress. These are very 
general concepts, of course, and they can mean different things in different 
communities. But today especially, this pillar of Enlightenment thought which 
emphasizes the worth of science and reason as tools in making human life better, 
more productive, more worthwhile and fulfilling, is under serious debate and 
attack. The popular culture is increasingly captivated by irrationality in the 
form of new-age faddism, pseudoscience, the emergence of a sort of postmodernist 
“belief bazaar,” as well as by the revitalization of fundamentalist or hard-line 
religious movements. According to your view, one can say Sri Ramkrshna's &quot;Jato 
mot Tato path&quot; should be considered as &quot;secular view&quot; as he indeed showed 
respect and tried to find truth by protecting every religion and their diverse 
mode of belief structure. you can call it &quot;sharbo-dhormo-shomonnoy&quot; or &quot;communal 
harmony&quot; or whatever you like, but this is no secularism; though this perverted 
or distorted view has been popularized recently in subcontinent in the name of 
secularism. However, if you consider the pillar of Enlightenment thought as the 
base of secularism, you would know that ramkrishna's view was merely religious 
or spiritual one. Spirituality is a belief, but secularism is real and tangible 
as this involves the institution of government is maintained by the taxes which 
people pay and by the co-operation which people give in this mundane world. I 
however understand your concern on pluralism and religious harmony:&nbsp; While 
political secularism, which allows religious belief to be treated as a personal 
affair, can serve as a&nbsp; formula for immediate peace and order, straight 
denial of religious activities or&nbsp; injunctions from state and govt, will 
make secularism secure at all levels.&nbsp; It may sound a bit harsh, but that 
is the right interpretation of &quot;Dhormoniropekkhota&quot;, at least I think.</p>
<p>I wish to convey my thanks again for your remark conveying that I follow the 
secular principle. Regarding my book &quot;Alo Hate choliyachey Adharer Jaatree&quot;,&nbsp; 
yes the line was indeed taken from a famous song of Tagore &quot;Tumee ki keboli 
chobi...&quot; which was composed by Rabi Thakur&nbsp; in memory of Kadambari debi. I 
wrote few lines about the song in the preface of my book.</p>
<p>take care</p>
