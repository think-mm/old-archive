&gt; Dear Avijit,<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Thanks for the nice article.<br>
&gt; ]<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response: Thanks your compliment. I just hurriedly put into the web and my 
initial writeup contained a lot of spelling mistakes. I corrected some, and 
still some mistakes might be there. Please bear with this. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[&gt; I have some questions, however. Lets suppose that there is NO material in 
the universe (just keep aside for a moment). Just think about the SPACE (a vast 
emptyness). Big Bang theory says that the universe is expanding and it is an 
absolutely empirical theory now. My questions are:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. How did the SPACE created. ]</p>
<p>Response: Let me speak about something on space in layman terms. In classical 
physics, space is defined as a three-dimensional Euclidean space where any 
position can be described using three coordinates. However the idea of &quot;space&quot; 
has dramatically changed after Einstien's revolutionary paper on General Theory 
of relativity. Einstien's theory of relativity which agrees with a large number 
of experiments shows that time and space are inextricably interconnected. 
General relativity basically combines&nbsp; the &quot;time&quot; dimension with three 
other dimension of Euclidean space to form what is called &quot;spacetime&quot;. So it's 
useless to talk about space only as current Relativistic physics examines 
spacetime rather than space; spacetime is modeled as a four-dimensional 
manifold, and currently, there are theories (for example string theory) that can 
support even up to eleven-dimensional spaces.</p>
<p>Einstein's basic equation on relativity tells us how the space has been 
created and how it expands. </p>
<p><br>
[&gt; <br>
&gt; 2. Lets assume that the volume of the SPACE at a particular moment is 'X' 
(suppose it is a Sphere). What is outside of this Sphere at that moment? Also 
SPACE or solid or what? It cannot be solid, because the universe could not be 
expanded in this case, right? If it is also SPACE, then what does the 
'expanding' mean?<br>
&gt;]</p>
<p>Response: In our everyday experience we usually equate empty space with 
&quot;nothingness&quot;. Empty space has no mass, no color, no opacity, no texture, no 
hardness, no temperature etc, but yet it's not nothing. According to general 
relativity space is not a &quot;passive background&quot;, but instead a flexible mediam 
that can bend, twist and flex. The bending of space is the way gravitational 
field (which has a negative emery) described in the equation. So space is not 
&quot;solid&quot;, rather you can crudely imagine space as an &quot;invisible piece of rubber&quot;&nbsp; 
that can be easily bend or expand.&nbsp; I explained it it my Alo Hate adharer 
Jaatree, 3rd Part. Kindly take a look agin:</p>

<p>In 1982 Alexander Vilenkin of Tufts University showed in one of papers that 
this &quot;invisible piece of rubber&quot; which has a finite volume, can be decreased to 
the volume of zero. In other wards, Vilenkin showed the concept of absolute 
nothingness is at least mathematically defined&nbsp; (not matter how impossible 
to imagine for us) and can be used as a starting point for the theories of 
creation. There are other existing solutions (Hawking-Hartle proposal for 
instance) as well without invoking such absolute nothingness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
[&gt; 3. Big Bang theory also says that the universe was at a state of zero volume 
with infinite energy. What does it mean? How about the SPACE at that time? If 
the space was zero then how the SPACE was created and how it is getting bigger 
and bigger?]<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response I gave an idea of&nbsp; &quot;invisible piece of rubber&quot; which can be 
expanded. Imagine the whole space scenario as a balloon which is being inflated 
time to time after bigbang. I gave a picture in&nbsp; Alo Hate 4th Part, Kindly 
take a look :</p>

<p>The expansion of Universe was predicted by Einstein's equation, however 
Einstein himself could not understand the impact at that time. He introduced a 
term which is known as &quot;cosmological constant&quot; to prevent the expansion and made 
the Universe as &quot;static&quot;. Later Hubbles observation proved that Einstein was 
wrong and universe was expanding. Meanwhile, Friedmann published some correct 
solution of Einstein's equation, however his work were widely ignored until 
Hubble's observation pointed out the fact. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; <br>
&gt; Hope you got my point what I really wanted to mean. I am simply talking about 
the SPACE, nothing else. How did it create, how is it expanding, what is outside 
of the current SPACE, etc.</p>
<p>We are not sure what is in outside space, cause our universe have no 
reflection, no memory and current technology cannot give the observational data 
of outer world/space/matter, if there is any. </p>
