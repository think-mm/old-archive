<p><i>You said Sex Education means education for making safer sex. </i>In 
traditional sense, Yes. However I do not want to restrict such education in such 
&quot;narrow domain&quot;. Here is an important link you may want to check, which may 
clarify what actually I was referring&nbsp;&nbsp; :</p>

<p>Please let me know whether our children get such education and also let me 
know whether such education is useless at all.</p>
<p><i>&quot;America is a free-sex country and there is a proper Sex Education, but 
thousands of women are rapped there each year. ..So, there should be a single 
Code of Conduct to make our society peaceful.&quot;</i></p>
<p>Response: Before making any conclusion, we need to know why sex harassments occur in 
the first place. Male chauvinistic ego, sexual superiority&nbsp; complex, 
thinking women as commodity, frustration among young generation, mental sickness 
and disorder, law and order situation and many other things are involved. Not 
all the things can be handled by proper sex education, however some can. </p>
<p>True,&nbsp; there are incidents on child molestation, rape case etc in US, however 
normally people do not get afraid to report against those crimes. &quot;Raper kotha 
janle meyer aar biye hobe na&quot; - such situation never arises in such 
countries compared to ours. Each and every 
country has its own problem. America is a capitalist country. Many scholars think rape 
molestation etc are an integral part of the capitalist system where Profits over people, 
viewing women just as commodities, aggression 
rather than compassion, and establishing control are the main tenets of the 
system. Of course capitalist society has some advantages which freedom 
loving US people enjoys;&nbsp; however, compared to socialist countries, women 
oppression, rape, molestation etc are high due to the very reason they created 
for themselves. The issue needs a socio-political explanation which will take 
time and space. we can discuss this some other time.</p>
<p>Statistics of rape in one particular country does not invalidate the 
necessity of sex-education either.&nbsp; I have seen one statistics where it 
claimed that most of the road accidents occurs due to some other reason, not due 
to driver's alertness or abiding rules. But does this simple statistics nullify 
the necessity of&nbsp; being alert and abiding rules while driving? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>Now two questions for you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) In the Victorian Era, English ladies hardly showed their flesh to 
strangers. They even wore gloves to hid their fingers from their view. Today, 
English ladies use much less fabrics than men to cover their bodies. Does this 
mean that the English ladies have become indecent these days? Are English men 
taking advantage of them? What about those women we see on beaches and around 
swimming pools in bikinis? Do they get harassed or raped for what they wear? </p>
<p>2) In the African continents, there are tribes whose women do not cover the 
upper part of their bodies. In the jungle of Amazon, there live some tribes 
whose women do not wear any cloth. Despite moving around with their tops 
uncovered or without any cloth on their bodies, men do not rape their half 
dressed or fully naked women. This is due to the reason that &quot;decency&quot; carries a 
different meaning for those so-called uncivilized people.&nbsp; Interestingly 
those tribal girls use to get afraid to come our &quot;civilized&quot; world for being 
afraid of molestation. Would you kindly explain what restricts the tribal guys 
to molest their half-naked ladies, where you guys cannot do?</p>
