<p>Hi Sharmeen,</p>
<p>Our discussion is being shifted from JaiJaidin to religious discussion which 
I am not at all comfortable. Our original&nbsp; focus different. In most of the 
cases people &quot;gets hurt&quot;&nbsp; in such religious discussion, as they are very 
sensitive issues. I am trying to respond to the points you raised, though I am a 
bit worried how you will react in future. If you find troubling, please let me 
know, I will not continue to proceed further.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font color="#0000FF"><i>You said, First of all, you were not my target, 
	if my words made you feel that way- I'm sorry. I don't care what they wear 
	in Singapore or any other city for that matter. I was expressing my feelings 
	as a muslim, so far I know, less women are raped or assaulted( I consider 
	staring as one one of them) in mid-eastern countries, I think a muslim woman 
	should dress according to her religion, what I abhor is double-standard, 
	either you call yourself a muslim and beahave accordingly or part from 
	it...&quot;</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You said, &quot;I don't care what they wear in Singapore or any other city for 
that matter...&quot;. Actually you don't have to care. Nobody is insisting&nbsp; you 
wear dress like them. You can wear your dress according to your choice, just as 
a Singaporean can wear according to his/her wish. There is no &quot;greatness&quot; in it, 
there is no &quot;vulgarness&quot; either. Did I tell you to wear a dress like a 
Singaporean? No, I never did. You can wear whatever you like. What I said was 
that just because they dressed differently compared to our &quot;great culture&quot;, 
rape, molestation&nbsp; in Singapore did not increase at all. Or more 
specifically, just because a Singaporean lady wear a bikini in a sea-beach,&nbsp; 
does not mean all other Singaporean male is jumping on her and starting 
molestation. In fact, people understand human rights and freedom to choose, the 
concept is seem to be missing in our &quot;culture&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You said, &quot;I think a muslim woman should dress according to her religion&quot;. 
You may be right. But Bangladesh is a place where Muslims, Hindus, Buddists, 
Christian all live. A Bangladeshi Christian may say, &quot;I don't care what a Muslim 
dresses according to her religion, I wish to follow western style&quot;. You just 
cant blame. He is a Bangladeshi too. Again, if you want to talk about Muslims 
only, even many muslims in BD are not seem to agree among themselves on the 
matter of&nbsp; what you said, &quot;dress according to religion&quot;. For example, a 
fundamentalist Muslim may believe wearing Shari and blouse is unislamic, and may 
suggest that as per islamic doctrine, it is necessary to cover-up the whole body 
in a burkha.&nbsp; This is what Delwar Hossain Saidi, the Jamat leader believes 
in :</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;God sends these fruits to us in 'packets' to save them from flies and 
	insects, that is why they taste so good. All good things in life are 
	shrouded with covers and mystery. This is why a woman should be covered from 
	head to toe&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am sure many muslim women will not agree with such stupid male-chauvinistic 
comment of Delwar H. Saidi where he compared women with &quot;tasty fruits&quot; and 
follow the logic of wearing burkha. Bangladeshi women have a good tradition of 
wearing Sharis etc. not just only in Pahela Boishakh, but also in their daily 
lives and all other functions, no matter what mullahs like Saidi, Golam rahman, 
Maulavi Samsul Huda etc. preaches from Islamic doctrine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font color="#0000FF"><i>You said, what I abhor is <b>double-standard</b>, 
	either you call yourself a muslim and beahave accordingly or part from it, 
	...</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me clarify who is in double-standard as per Islam. Take your own example. 
Let us see what Quran say about non-belivers: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>3:28, Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers 
	rather than believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from 
	Allah </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this how you think about your Christian, Hindu or atheist neighbors? Do 
you really reject the friendship of good people just because they are not 
Muslims? If you answer in negative then you are not really following the 
teachings of Quran even though you call yourself a Muslim.&nbsp; This is what 
double standard is. </p>
<p>How about this teaching: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>2:216, Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is 
	possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you say about this? Did you pack to go to Afghanistan to fight in the 
Jihad called by the Taliban? Do you think those who did that were wrong? Don’t 
you think teachings such as these motivate some people to become Jihadis and 
kill innocent kafirs? How can you reconcile your love for humanity with 
teachings these teachings?&nbsp; Many terrorists are thinking that they are in 
right path as per Quran &quot;Fighting is prescribed&quot; and many of them are inspired 
by the violent verses. </p>
<p>Its good that most of the muslims do not think like Bin Laden, and they are 
peaceful, just because they do not follow Quran literally, rather they are 
following common sense. Now you tell me whether &quot;common sense&quot; should be taken 
as &quot;double standard&quot;?</p>
<p>Please note that I am not preaching any hate toward your religion or any 
other. I have read Quran in detail from my childhood. I know Quran has a lot of 
good verses too. A tolerant good-hearted&nbsp; Muslim may be attracted to the 
earlier verses of Quran when Muhammad had no power and spoke good words like: 
&quot;Speak good to men...&quot; (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.083">2: 
83</a>) &quot;To you be your religion, and to me my religion&quot; (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/109.qmt.html#109.006">109: 
6</a>) and &quot;There is no compulsion in religion&quot;(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.256">2:256</a>). 
But a bigot who has a sadistic predisposition will give emphasis to the violent 
verses of Quran that were revealed when the Prophet became powerful and need no 
more “speak good to men” or ask them to be tolerant to him letting him practice 
his religion. So his tone changed and he revealed violent verses like these:&nbsp; 
“Fight them on until there is no more tumult and religion becomes that of Allah” 
(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/02.qmt.html#02.193">2: 193</a>),&nbsp; 
&quot;Whoso desires another religion than Islam, it shall not be accepted of him; in 
the next world he shall be among the losers.&quot;(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/003.qmt.html#003.085">3: 
85</a>) etc. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left">Such contradictions are also existed in Bible 
or Hindu scriptures. In fact all holy books are full of these contradictions and 
discrepancies. Each person can pick and choose what he wishes. A pious person 
will lead a pious life and will see the good things in Quran, while a terrorist 
can also find justification of his killings in that holy book.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><i><font color="#0000FF">You said, &quot;Qur-an doesn't support revenge or 
	honor-killing, something done by a Saudi brother doesn't make it right nor 
	they represent Islam&quot;</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;How do you know that it is you who are representing Islam, not Saudis? 
May be it is you who is not aware of the violent verses that justify honor 
killing or stoning to death etc? May be they are the one who literally following 
the holy instruction? For e.g, one hindu may &quot;believe&quot; from his ignorance that 
there is no justification of burning widows. I am bring the issue because, we 
have a precise record that about 8135 widows were burned cruelly between the 
year 1815- 1828 in ancient India. Not that the people who promoted &quot;Sati&quot; were 
all fundamentalists, rather they merely inspired to implement the &quot;holy&quot; 
instructions of scripture such as: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&quot;A sati who dies on the funeral pyre of her husband enjoys an eternal 
	bliss in heaven&quot; [ Daksa Smrti IV.18-19 ] [ Sm.Samu p.30 ] [ 1200, p.65 ]
	</p>
	<p>&quot;A woman must, on the death of her husband, allow herself to be burnt 
	alive on the same funeral pyre&quot; [Vasishta's Padma-Purana, DuB.345 ]. etc.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whom should you blame! If we look the history of Christianity we will also 
find the same. Around 1 crore innocent women were burned during 14th to 18th 
century from the Biblical belief that justified the burning of women in Europe 
judged as witches: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Kill The Witches! &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. Whoever lieth 
	with a beast shall surely be put to death. He that sacrificeth unto any god, 
	save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.&quot; (Exodus 22:18-20) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>History reveals that the consequences of &quot;absolute faith&quot; and &quot;beliefs&quot; have 
created mental barriers to understanding and has caused ignorance, misery, 
violence and war. In fact many rational persons are convinced that beliefs 
create more social problems than they solve and that beliefs, and especially 
those elevated to faith, produce the most destructive potential to the of 
humankind. I wrote several Bangla articles on this. Here is one: </p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts on this first, and we will discuss later on this 
more if time permits.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font color="#0000FF"><i>You said:</i></font></p>
	<p><i><font color="#0000FF">I found it intersting that you said I shouldn't 
	be bothered as long as it doesn't hurt me physically. It's true practising 
	homosexuality don't do that, neither raping my sister or wife, killing my 
	husband or brother, nor adultery, faraohs used to sleep with their siblings- 
	it's not really harmful for me as long as I'm not a part of it, ... we are

</blockquote>
<p>Practicing Homosexuality or whatever does not really bother to me as long as 
it impacts my personal life. I am not a gay, but Infact many a times I found a 
gay person is gentle, friendly and well-behaved. Just because his sexual 
orientation is different I would not call him evil or &quot;polluting next 
generation&quot; etc. The scientists are now convinced that cause of homosexuality is 
rooted in biology. Evidences of homosexuality were found in

dolphin</a>, <a href="http://www.sensualism.com/gay/">penguin</a>,

monkeys</a> too.

Many Report Suggests Homosexuality is Linked to Biological Genes</a>, if this is 
true very little we can do; just spreading hate to gays and lesbians will not 
solve the issue. This may be the reason we still find &quot;Gay Muslims&quot; in every 
country despite the fact Islam does not permit it:</p>

<p>Let me give a touchy story of Bangali gay :</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/sajal/homosexuality.pdf">https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/sajal/homosexuality.pdf</a>
</p>
<p>To me it is more polluting and destructing if someone follows the following 
holy instruction literally :</p>
<p>The holy book tells believers to kill the disbelievers wherever they find 
them (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.191">2:191</a>), 
murder them and treat them harshly (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/073.qmt.html#073.010">9</a><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/009.qmt.html#009.123">:123</a>), 
slay them&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/009.qmt.html#009.005">9:5</a>), 
fight with them (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/008.qmt.html#008.065">8:65
</a>), strive against them with great endeavor (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/025.qmt.html#025.052">25:52</a>), 
be stern with them because they belong to hell (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/066.qmt.html#066.009">66:9</a>), 
to strike off their heads; then after making a “wide slaughter among them, 
carefully tie up the remaining captives” for ransom (Q;<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/047.qmt.html#047.004">47:4</a>) 
etc. It relegates those who disbelieve to hell&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/073.qmt.html#073.010">5</a><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.010">:10</a>), 
calls the disbelievers as najis (filthy, untouchable, impure) (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/073.qmt.html#073.010">9</a><a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/009.qmt.html#009.028">:28</a>), 
orders the believers to fight them until no other religion except the specific 
one is left (<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/02.qmt.html#02.193">2:193</a>) 
etc.</p>
<p>what do you think? what is more troubling towards humanity and future 
generation? </p>
<p>Let me stop here for today . But before ending, I will be glad if you comment
