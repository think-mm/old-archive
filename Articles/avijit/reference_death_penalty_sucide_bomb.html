<p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Here are my comments on the use of 
suicide as a tool of fighting: </span></b></p>
<p>The Qur'an prohibits suicide for personal reasons only, for example: under 
depression, poverty, pain from suffering of disease...etc. </p>
<p>However, there is no verse which specifically prohibits suicide as a mean of 
jihad strategy. In fact there are verses which tersely stipulates that it is the 
duty of Muslims to go ahed to kill and be killed. Here is are some samples: </p>
<p><b>Those killed for Islam (in Jihad) are not dead, they are alive...2:154</b>
</p>
<p><b>It is better to receive Allah's mercy and forgiveness by getting killed in 
the cause of God…3:157 </b></p>
<p><b>The true believers forsake his world in favor of hereafter; a jihadist, 
whether martyred or not gains victory and will be sent to paradise (it is a 
bargain from Allah, it motivates the suicide bombers)...4:74 </b></p>
<p><b>God tests the believers through a game of trials and fight whoever fails 
the test will receive a painful punishment from Him (suicide bombers use this 
verse to justify their act)...5:94 </b></p>
<p><b>God's offer (Islam) is a bargain (this is a motivation for the suicide 
bombers)...61:10 </b></p>
<p><b>In return for fighting for God, He forgives sins and guarantees beautiful 
mansions in the gardens of eternity (fighting and dying for Islam is a bargain 
from Allah; suicide bombers use this verse for motivation)...61:12 </b></p>
<p><b>The believers fight in the cause of Allah; they kill and get killed; this 
is the doctrine of Allah; He has purchased the lives and goods of the believers 
in exchange for booty and paradise; their obligation is the willingness to kill 
and get killed in a fight; this is the pledge of God in the Torah, Gospel and 
the Qur’an (these verses motivate the suicide bombers)…9:111-112 </b></p>
<p>Please use the Qur'an link to quote the complete verse/s. </p>
<p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Hadis: </span></p>
<p><b>Sahih Bukhari. </b></p>
<p>Muhammad eulogized a person (Amir b. al-Akwa) for committing suicide for 
Allah's cause; suicde attack is the best method to kill infidels (Amir died of 
injury? Condradictory hadis; see 5.59.509)...9.83.29 </p>
<p>Volume 9, Book 83, Number 29: Narrated Salama: We went out with the Prophet 
to Khaibar. A man (from the companions) said, &quot;O 'Amir! Let us hear some of your 
Huda (camel-driving songs.)&quot; So he sang some of them (i.e. a lyric in harmony 
with the camels walk). The Prophet said, &quot;Who is the driver (of these camels)?&quot; 
They said, &quot;Amir.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;May Allah bestow His Mercy on him !&quot; The 
people said, &quot;O Allah's Apostle! Would that you let us enjoy his company 
longer!&quot; Then 'Amir was killed the following morning. The people said, &quot;The good 
deeds of 'Amir are lost as he has killed himself.&quot; I returned at the time while 
they were talking about that. I went to the Prophet and said, &quot;O Allah's 
Prophet! Let my father be sacrificed for you! The people claim that 'Amir's good 
deeds are lost.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever says so is a liar, for 'Amir will 
have a double reward as he exerted himself to obey Allah and fought in Allah's 
Cause. No other way of killing would have granted him greater reward.&quot; </p>
<p>Please note that there is another Hadis which seemingly contradicts this 
hadis. I use the previous hadis, i.e., 9.83.29 because the permission of suicide 
killing is also found in Sunaan Abu Dawud. Here is the contradictory hadis. </p>
<p>Muhammad praised the poems of Amir b. al-Akwa; later, Amir b.al-Akwa, when he 
threw his knife to kill a Jew at Khaybar, the knife returned back to him, 
injured him and later he died of the injury; Muhammad pomised a reward if killed 
by a Jew (Amir b.al-Akwa committed suicide? See 9.83.29) ...5.59.509 </p>
<p>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 509: Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: We went out to 
Khaibar in the company of the Prophet. While we were proceeding at night, a man 
from the group said to 'Amir, &quot;O 'Amir! Won't you let us hear your poetry?&quot; 'Amir 
was a poet, so he got down and started reciting for the people poetry that kept 
pace with the camels' footsteps, saying:-- &quot;O Allah! Without You we Would not 
have been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In charity, nor 
would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed (i.e. our 
defects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina (i.e. 
calmness) Upon us to make our feet firm When we meet our enemy, and If they will 
call us towards An unjust thing, We will refuse. The infidels have made a hue 
and Cry to ask others' help Against us.&quot; The Prophet on that, asked, &quot;Who is 
that (camel) driver (reciting poetry)?&quot; The people said, &quot;He is 'Amir bin Al-Akwa'.&quot; 
Then the Prophet said, &quot;May Allah bestow His Mercy on him.&quot; A man amongst the 
people said, &quot;O Allah's Prophet! has (martyrdom) been granted to him. Would that 
you let us enjoy his company longer.&quot; Then we reached and besieged Khaibar till 
we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Allah helped the Muslims conquer it 
(i.e. Khaibar). In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the 
Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet said, &quot;What are these fires? For cooking 
what, are you making the fire?&quot; The people replied, &quot;(For cooking) meat.&quot; He 
asked, &quot;What kind of meat?&quot; They (i.e. people) said, &quot;The meat of donkeys.&quot; The 
Prophet said, &quot;Throw away the meat and break the pots!&quot; Some man said, &quot;O 
Allah's Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots instead?&quot; He 
said, &quot;(Yes, you can do) that too.&quot; So when the army files were arranged in rows 
(for the clash), 'Amir's sword was short and he aimed at the leg of a Jew to 
strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own 
knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Allah's 
Apostle saw me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, &quot;What is bothering 
you?&quot; I replied, &quot;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say 
that the deeds of 'Amir are lost.&quot; The Prophet said, &quot;Whoever says so, is 
mistaken, for 'Amir has got a double reward.&quot; The Prophet raised two fingers and 
added, &quot;He (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and 
there are few 'Arabs who achieved the like of (good deeds) 'Amir had done.&quot; </p>

<p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Death sentences in Islam </span>
</b></p>
<p>As far as I could recall: </p>
<p>Death sentences are proclaimed for the following Islamic crimes: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>1. Murder (only when Muslim kills another Muslim without a good reason). 
	Killing a non-Muslim by a Muslim is not punishable by death, alternative 
	punishment could be life imprisonment, blood money. </p>
	<p>2. Adultery by a married man or a married woman. </p>
	<p>3. Apostasy. Leaving Islam is punishable by death. </p>
	<p>4. Blasphemy. Criticising Muhammad is punishable by death. </p>
