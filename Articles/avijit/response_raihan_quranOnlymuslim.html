<p class="MsoNormal">Dear Raihan,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I read all your write-up with interest. I am disappointed 
in a sense that it was you once wrote a very logical essay “Khelicho e Biswo 
Loye”, “oboyob kolpona chara ki prarothona shombhob”, “pathor Pathor khela ar 
kotokaal” &nbsp;or debated with MC with logic etc., and then it is you for some 
unknown reason gradually transformed to one of those “Quran Defending guy”. &nbsp;You 
even try to portray nowadays that Bin Laden is a terrorist, not because of Quran 
but just because of Hadiths and Sharia. You perhaps seem to either forget or 
ignore the violent verses in Quran (see: 2:191, 2:193, 3:28, 4:84, 4:89 , 4:141, 
8:12, &nbsp;8:60, 8:65, 9:14, 9:29, 9:73, 25:52, 48:29, &nbsp;3:151 etc.) that could be 
solely sufficient to wage war against infidels and non believer and murder them 
(of course both of us are not forgetting the impact of &nbsp;US policy and other 
geo-political reasons) . Not to mention about the&nbsp; drastic &nbsp;errors in Quran such 
as flat earth (15:19, 20:53, 43.10, 50: 7, 51:48), &nbsp;immovable earth (27:61, 
30:25, 35:41, 31:10, 2:22, 16:15 etc.), existence of invisible genies who climb 
over each other’s shoulders and reach the heaven to eavesdrop the conversation 
of the “Exalted Assembly”, the stars are used as missiles (shooting stars) to 
hit the genies (Q67.5), Mary (Miriam) the sister of Moses (19:28) and many 
others. Recently, you also seem to defend the legend of Noah’s flood the way it 
has been depicted in Quran (see your letter to Ananta). You tried to put a 
flavor of “local” flood even though nowhere in your submitted sura &nbsp;I found the 
word &nbsp;“local”. You perhaps do not realize that all the Quranic fables (six day’s 
creation, Adam-Eve story, Noah’s flood or even some customs like Hajj etc.) were 
taken from the Old and New Testaments and the pagan lore of the Arabs.&nbsp; Even 
though the verses have Noah’s name (11:36), his building of ship (11:37) or 
taking species in the ship with pairs (11:40) etc. you found Quran’s description 
is “somewhat different”. &nbsp;The worst case is, many of your recent write-ups have 
indirect support of unfortunate the status of women described in Quran (in one 
of your message you compared with Bible etc. and gave sermon &nbsp;that Muslim women 
get superior status), never realizing the way women are being treated in Islamic 
world compared to secular country, nor the meaning of tilt (2:223) that Quran 
offers to treat wives; &nbsp;or never realizing how the apostates are being treated 
in Islamic world. No wonder, you found that Afghani Abdur Rahman as an 
exceptional case, even though there were many similar examples even in recent 
times. The problem is you did not study properly. Had you studied proper 
history, sociology or anthropology ( especially how the concept of God, soul or 
religion evolved in human mind &nbsp;starting from Neanderthal peoples’ time etc.), I 
am sure you would not have confined to silly “interpretation” of Quranic flood 
etc. &nbsp;This is the basic lacking (i.e. proper education on social science etc.) 
for which most of the BUET / BIT students in BD, even though with brilliant 
academic record &nbsp;are found religious and often engaged in tabling party etc; and 
science faculty especially mathematics and physics department of &nbsp;Dhaka 
University produces so many Islamists and Razakars as well as pseudo Islamic 
scholars like Shamsher Ali who engage his time and energy finding miracles and 
modern scientific facts &nbsp;in ancient holy books; &nbsp;whereas English, Bangla or 
various liberal arts dept of DU continuously produce freethinkers like Ahmed 
Sharif, Humayun Azad, Kbair Chowdhury, Wahid Reza, Sirajul Islam Chowdhury et al 
time to time. Have you ever wondered why!</p>
