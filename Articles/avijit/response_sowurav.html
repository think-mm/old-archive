<p>Thanks to fatemolla bhai for his valuable suggestion and comment. I would 
like to thank Jahed too for his successful campaign in NY book fair! Responses 
are quite encouraging here - in Singapore, too.&nbsp; Ankur delivered 15 copies 
of the book and many NUS students have ordered several copies. </p>
<p>Lastly thanks to Bonna and especially Dr. Ajoy Roy without him nothing would 
go in the right direction. </p>

<p>Dear Dr. Sowurav,</p>
<p>Its a pleasure to read your encouraging comments about my book. I am an 
engineer by profession not a writer, never imagined that I would become an 
&quot;author&quot; (in Jahed's term) one day. I formed mukto-mona with some of my 
like-minded friends to stress the need to eradicate ignorance, superstition, 
belief in super- natural phenomena, illiteracy, social evils, and to promote 
rationalism, humanism, secularism and concrete measures to help those affected 
by natural and man-made calamities. I started writing Bangla articles just few 
years ago while Bornosoft came into market and fortunately internet Bengali 
community accepted my write-ups cordially ; I got some positive feedback. That 
inspired me a lot to formulate one of my series into book format, though my own 
publisher initially a bit skeptic (They said, &quot;ei boi cholbe na!&quot;). Upon 
receiving positive feedback from general readers each and every day, i am pretty 
convinced that they were wrong!&nbsp; Apart than my nearest and dearest friends,
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">the monumental work of Aroj Ali Matubbar 
and Prabir Ghosh inspired me a lot in my childhood. These lovable real &quot;science 
teachers&quot; literally asked me&nbsp; not to accept anything without questioning. 
This is the key issue&nbsp; that can inspire one to acquire knowledge and lead 
his life for Spirit of humanity. Yet we have to travel a long way. </font> </p>
<p>The book you are reading is a result of real team work. All of my friends in 
Mukto-Mona gave valuable suggestions, many of my well-wishers voluntarily worked 
(and still working) for its successful marketing, and above all my father worked 
literally in day and night for publishing this book from Bangladesh.&nbsp; 
Without their help the book would not come into light.</p>
<p>I am giving a CC to mukto-mona publication group. You can subscribe to our 
forum, if you haven't already.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Avijit</p>
