  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="color: #003300">Richard Carrier’s recent essay “<a href="http://www.secweb.org/asset.asp?AssetID=362" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">Predicting 
  Modern Science: Epicurus vs. Mohammed</a>” in Secular Web inspired me to reform 
  this treatise.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the founding moderator of
  <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
  Mukto-mona</a> (an internet congregation of secularists, atheists, agnostics, 
  freethinkers, rationalists, skeptics and humanists of Bengali origin) for more 
  than three years, I had to engage in argument by discussing with indefinite 
  numbers of Bangladeshi apologists; multitudinous are from highly educated of 
  Islamic origin (mentioned as “Islamic scholars” hereafter). &nbsp;I have examined 
  all the arguments (scientific-hermeneutic approach) the Islamic scholars 
  commonly put forward in favor of the divine origin for the text of their holy 
  scripture. I have also gone through many&nbsp;web-pages, books and videos that have 
  been produced by both Bengali and non-Bengali Islamic sources proclaiming&nbsp;that 
  some verses in their scriptures contain super-scientific facts. This essay is 
  an attempt to examine critically and carefully some, if not all, of those 
  “miraculous scientific facts”, and to point out some fallacies, myths and 
  “clever reinterpretation” of the vague verses that appear in the debates with 
  an intent to convince others about the pseudo-scientific claims. I have 
  written previously a lot in some online newspapers, progressive web-sites and 
  forums, both in Bengali and English, touching the issues (Richard Carrier also 
  referred to one of my essays in his above-mentioned piece). Also I have found 
  Jochen Katz' </span>
  <a href="http://www.answering-islam.org" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
  Answering-Islam</a><span style="color: #003300"> site serves as a great 
  resource for possible answers to such popular claims, nevertheless, they have 
  not touched all the considerable topics, for e.g, Big Bang, the expansion of 
  Universe to mention few. &nbsp;Again, Answering-Islam team always responds the 
  issues from a Christian perspective. Approaches to this polemic from a secular 
  non-theist (atheist/agnostic/skeptic) perspective are somewhat slim on the net 
  [</span><span style="color: blue"><a href="#12">12</a></span><span style="color: #003300">]. 
  This is also one of my motivations to formulate this article especially for 
  secular web (by mentioning my personal inclination towards secular philosophy, 
  I am not disregarding the comprehensive wealth of material criticizing Islam 
  and Qur’an in Answering-Islam though). </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="color: #003300">The fundamentalist Islamic scholars always claim 
  that Qur’an miraculously predicted many invention of modern science and all of 
  those Qur’anic predictions and myths are flawless. &nbsp;Their plan of action 
  lifted to a newer dimension serving euphoria to a great extent when they have 
  found Dr. Maurice Bucaille, a French physician started talking in favor of 
  their faith in his famous book &quot;The Bible, The Qur’an and Science.” [</span><span style="color: blue"><a href="#4">4</a></span><span style="color: #003300">]. 
  They suddenly started finding Big Bang theory, expansion of universe, atom, 
  molecules, shooting stars, embryologic facts, cosmology, genetics and many 
  other theories of modern science in Qur’an! Although, I found Bucaille's 
  intentions of relating modern science with Islam are somewhat wishful, shady, 
  ambiguous and doubtful; the dearth of &quot;well-written&quot; books by occidental 
  non-Muslim scholars available in English necessitates the use this particular 
  book to propagate various form of pro-Islamic apologia. The objective of this 
  article is not to focus on the arguments of Dr. Bucaille in general, as two of 
  my Mukto-Mona collogues have already done a splendid job in their respective 
  articles [</span><span style="color: blue"><a href="#4">4</a></span><span style="color: #003300">,
  </span><span style="color: blue"><a href="#13">13</a></span><span style="color: #003300">] 
  by exposing some of the dishonest tricks taken by Dr. Bucaille. Also, there 
  are some other books from Christian perspective available which categorically 
  refuted Dr. Bucaille’s numerous pseudo-scientific claims [</span><span style="color: blue"><a href="#14">14</a></span><span style="color: #003300">]. 
  The purpose of my article is mainly to show the flawed nature of Islamic 
  apologists who use to link science with ambiguous religious verses and 
  subsequently claim transcendental nature of holy verses on the discovery of 
  many scientific truths. Before dwelling on it further, I wish to put here 
  three of my important objections to such claims, in my later part of 
  discussion I will refute the specific claims of those famous scientific myths.

  1:</span></b><span style="color: #003300"> If it was indeed the case those 
  scriptures contain scientific facts and principles then we wouldn't need 
  popular science books to explain scientific facts to common people. Instead 
  the verses of the scriptures which are claimed to represent scientific facts 
  and principles could be compiled and published as an &quot;Introduction to 
  Science&quot;. There is no doubt&nbsp;that if those vague verses are indeed compiled and 
  edited (omitting God or prophets and other holy references) and then published 
  as a&nbsp;science book, these books will not even be published, even if it is, no 
  one will buy it. It is a sure failure, that's why it has never been attempted 
  by the apologists. These verses cannot stand on their own merit as anything 
  close to even a popular exposition of scientific facts and principles, let 
  alone as accurate scientific statements. </span></p>

  <span style="color: #003300">If Qur’an is a book of science, then what branch 
  of science is this? Physics ? Chemistry ? Biology ? Social science? Library 
  science? Political science? No answer.&nbsp; </span>[<a href="#1">1</a>]<span style="color: #003300">&nbsp; 
  Islamic scholars can only&nbsp; give the answer in the line of 
  technological/medical science relating blurry wordings of the book with 
  practical examples of embryology, astronomy, Big-Bang etc. Moreover, if one 
  considers Qur’an as a scientific book then, they should be able to show us <b>
  at least one scientific principle</b> that is disclosed in the Qur'an without 
  using any mumbo jumbo words and hocus pocus&nbsp;boring tricks of difficulty with 
  confusing translation of&nbsp; the Qur'an. They should be able to tell us&nbsp;where in the 
  Qur'an one can find the laws of gravitation, laws of planetary rotation, 
  principle of atomic structure of matters, the periodic table of elements, 
  theory of relativity, geological science and which chapter of Qur’an deals 
  with the modern science of aerodynamics, genetics engineering and 
  inter-planetary travel, and elucidation of genetic code etc [<a href="#2">2</a>]. 
  We fail to ascertain any meaningful direction. Moreover, If a perfect book 
  written by a perfect God having intention to reveal a scientific idea, it 
  should not have been so vague and metaphoric, but accurate and scientific 
  enough that it can be put in a physics /chemistry/biology textbook without the 
  need of any change. Not a single verse in the Holy Books contain even one 
  scientific term, like atom, electron, cloning, Theory of relativity, 
  Uncertainty principle etc. A &quot;perfect&quot; book cannot be lacking in precision so 
  much [<a href="#3">3</a>]. &nbsp;In fact, the term “Islamic Science” popularly 
  quoted in Islamic web-sites and articles by the Islamic scholars is also 
  flawed in nature, if we consider the basic definition of science, not 
  <i>scienticism </i>per se. Pakistani Nobel laureate Physicist Dr. Abdus Salam, wrote in 
  forwarding letter of Dr. Parvez Hoodboy’s book [</span><span style="color: blue"><a href="#16">16</a></span><span style="color: #003300">]:
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">
  “There is only one Universal Science; its problems and modalities are 
  international and there is no such thing as Islamic Science just as there is 
  no Hindu Science, nor Jewish Science, no Confucian Science, nor Christian 
  Science&quot;. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="color: #003300">This is the inherent beauty of science - the 
  scientists can speak the same language irrespective to their races, religion 
  or nations, and the language is science itself.&nbsp; Nobel laureate Physicist 
  Steven Weinberg also remarked in the same manner [</span><span style="color: blue"><a href="#17">17</a></span><span style="color: #003300">]:
  </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">
  &quot;The experience of listening to a discussion of Quantum field theory or weak 
  interactions in a seminar room in Tsukuba or Bombay gives me a powerful 
  impression that the laws of physics have an existence of their own.” &nbsp;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span style="color: #003300">The concept of <i>Islamic science</i> is 
  therefore faulty in light of science. </span></p>

  If one insists that the verses of scriptures are literally word of Allah 
  (God)&nbsp;who is <u>omnipotent</u> and <u>omniscient</u> then one is forced to 
  conclude that Allah as a perfect being is even a worse science writer than 
  humans and if Allah really wanted to communicate scientific facts and 
  principles to his mortal creations, humans He failed miserably. Nobody 
  discovered or understood those scientific facts and principles until humans 
  discovered them on their own with no help from the verses. And as the words of 
  a perfect being, the scientific accuracy of the verses should have been of 
  such magnitude and objectivity that their could not be any scope of any 
  dispute about them among humans and all would accept them like they do all the 
  scientific principles discussed in science text books. </span></p>

  such form in Qur’an can be easily guessed. Such kind of idea that the heavens 
  and earth were once joined and then separated by the activity of Gods and 
  Goddesses was actually quite common among pagans of the Middle East. Among the 
  Egyptians for example, it was the involuntary separation of Geb (the earth 
  god) from his wife and sister Nut (the sky goddess) that was responsible for 
  the division of the earth from the sky. The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh 
  likewise describes the moment “when the heavens had been separated from the 
  earth, when the earth had been delimited from the heavens” as a result of the 
  separation of a sky God (An) from a earth Goddess (Ki). If you remove the 
  pagan references, you have the same story as found in the Qur’an [</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: blue"><a href="#10">10</a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">].&nbsp;

  that I explained previously. Denish Giron also explained in one of his 
  wonderfully written pieces that the verb from which the Arabic word (<i>moosi'oon</i>) 
  is derived cannot mean ‘expand’ [</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: blue"><a href="#19">19</a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">].&nbsp;

  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">Also, according
  to Dr. Ali Sina the word used here is <i>moosiAAoona</i> which drives from
  word <i>vaseun</i>. [<a href="#24">24</a>] It means vast. It has nothing to do
  with expanding. When one says <i>al rezwano vaseun</i>&nbsp; it refers, 'the
  garden is vast'. It does not mean that the garden is expanding. Any Arab
  standing in the clear nights of the desert could lookup at the sky and see
  that it was vast. Muhammad is stating the obvious. There is no scientific
  miracle or prophecy&nbsp; in this.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">The 
  cause of the expansion of the universe is scientifically known from Modern 
  High Energy Astrophysics, known as the theory of inflation. The theory is 
  guided by Einstein's mathematical theory of general relativity about the 
  physical universe.&nbsp; These are all characterized, at any instant in 
  cosmological history, by mathematically- infinite space-like surfaces (3-d 
  space in other words). In this (open) model of the universe, everything is 
  expanding in the same sense that the points on a balloon's surface move away 
  from all other points as the balloon is inflated. General Relativity says that 
  for infinite universes, the same kind of expansion occurs. Inflationary 
  cosmology adds to this by saying that we live in a small pocket of some vaster 
  space-time. This pocked emerged from a tiny patch in the primordial space-time 
  and inflated to a vast size (I have
  <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/alo_hate/jatree.pdf" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">

  all, the universe did not begin as a gas or any gaseous material. From current 
  Big Bang theory we know, the universe began before any matter of any kind 
  existed--it began as pure energy. It took several moments for any matter to 
  form, and then it was a <b><i>plasma</i></b>, not a gas. Gases only came 
  later, after the plasma cooled, and yet gasses were still not the only 
  constituent--much of the mass-energy at even that point, as before, was 
  comprised of electromagnetic radiation--light. The fact that the Qur’an fails 
  to mention any of this or any other crucial scientific information is 
  precisely why its claim to &quot;scientific accuracy&quot; is to be dismissed. It is 
  making vague metaphysical statements, and that is not science [<a href="#7">7</a>]

  Secondly</span></u></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">, 
  Even, for the shake of arguments, if we take &quot;gaseous material&quot; as plasma, 
  then also the problem remains unsolved. The main problem is that the 
  above-mentioned verse actually does <i>not</i> say about any&nbsp; &quot;gaseous 
  material,&quot; which Islamic scholars are continuously claiming.&nbsp; The Arabic word 
  used in this verse&nbsp; is <i>dukhan</i>, -&nbsp; &quot;smoke&quot;&nbsp; [<a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/article/#[7]" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">7</a>].&nbsp;Trying 
  to relate smoke with gaseous material is nothing but a hide and seek wordy 
  games played by Islamic scholars. Moreover, Smoke is made of ash, 
  predominantly carbon, and is produced from burning (oxidation), not plasma 
  condensation. Smoke looks nothing like heated hydrogen or helium, does not 
  share its elemental mass or other properties, and does not even possess many 
  of the general properties of a gas. Thus, Allah chose the wrong word. He could 
  have used &quot;hot gases&quot; or &quot;hot gases expanding in a vacuum&quot; or anything which 
  is much closer to the truth.&nbsp; If we critically examine this verse, it becomes 
  very clear to us that this verse is far from being scientific to define 
  initial condition of the universe, that verse is really hoax.</span></p>

  <b><u>Thirdly</u></b>, Let's check the chronological order of the above verse 
  from Qur’an.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">

  41:9</a> </i>we find that that the earth is made &quot;in two days,&quot; and this is the 
  first two days in the list. After the creation of earth, Allah&nbsp; describes the 
  next two days of creation, completing the first &quot;four days equal,&quot; in which 
  mountains and plants are made in verse <i>
  <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/041.qmt.html#041.010" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
  41:10</a>.</i> Thus, we find a gradual order of the Qur'anic creation ie. Allah first 
  created the earth and then filled the earth with mountains and plants (It is 
  quite understandable that mountains and plants could not be made before the 
  earth was made, thus 41:10 follows 41:9 in a quite reasonable order).&nbsp; But 
  then we see that verse
  <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/041.qmt.html#041.011" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single; font-style:italic">
  41:11</a> establishes an undeniable context in which the <b>universe exists as 
  smoke</b> at the same time that <b>the earth already exists</b>, since God 
  &quot;rose over towards the heaven when it was smoke&quot; and spoke to it and to the 
  earth, therefore no Muslim can rationally deny that this verse clearly says 
  the earth existed at the same time as the smoke which is totally irrational 
  and absurd.</span></p>

  Man is not a product of any wet earth. Moreover, Qur’an ambiguously asserts 
  many common sensually meaningless statements about such an elementary matter

  from earth</u></b> (11:61), sometimes it claims <b><u>from dry clay</u></b> 
  (15:26,28,33, 17:61, 32:7), sometimes &quot;<b><u>from nothing</u></b>&quot; (19:67), 
  sometimes&nbsp; &quot;<b><u>NOT from nothing</u></b>&quot; (52:35), sometimes <b><u>from wet 
  earth</u></b> (23:12), or from <b><u>mire</u></b> (38:71), sometimes <b><u>

  3:59, 30:20, 35:11) or even sometimes from <b><u>dead</u></b> (30:19, 39:6).

  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">Many 
  people may amaze by the mention of sperm in this verse. <b>But close 
  observation reveals that there is nothing supernatural in it. </b>Since the 
  beginning of time man has been quite aware of the &quot;seed&quot; that is released from 
  the penis during sexual intercourse. The old Hindu scriptures or&nbsp;Bible, which 
  are much older than the Qur'an, also have such indication. Aristotle clearly 
  described about formation of a child inside the womb early 1,000 years before 
  the Qur'an was written. No body claimed any miracles for it. In fact Aristotle 
  correctly described the function of the umbilical cord, something not 
  mentioned in the Qur'an, showing that earlier philosophers were aware of such 
  things mentioned by Muhammad and more [<a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/article/#[8]" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">8</a>].&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">
  Actually the Qur'an contains erroneous ancient theories developed by Roman and 
  Greek philosophers&nbsp; about&nbsp; human development . Let us consider the following 
  verse referring to sperm:</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">
  He is created from a drop emitted- Proceeding from between the backbone and 
  the ribs:<span style="color: #003300"> (sura At-Tariq&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/086.qmt.html#086.006" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single; font-style:italic">86:6-7</a>)</span>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #003300">Clearly this 
  verse is incorrect, and clearly it has origins in earlier theories. First of 
  all, for sperm to originate between the back and the ribs would mean that it 
  comes from the kidneys! Greek physician <i>Hippocrates</i> theorized this 
  wrong idea long before Muhammad that sperm passed through the kidneys into the 
  penis. For centuries this was an accepted (and incorrect) belief of the 
  origins of sperm. Aristotle though correctly described the function of the 
  umbilical cord,&nbsp; also amusingly believed that sperm testicles functioned as 
  weights to keep the seminal passages open during sexual intercourse [</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: blue"><a href="#20">20</a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #003300">]. 
  One can easily find similar erroneous concepts in the Qur'an too. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">Let us 
  focus on another scenario by considering the following sura from Qur’an:</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin-left: .5in">
  <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">O mankind! if ye 
  are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, then lo! We have created you from 
  dust, then from a drop of seed, then from a clot, then from a little lump of 
  flesh shapely and shapeless, that We may make (it) clear for you. And We cause 
  what We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed time, and afterward We 
  bring you forth as infants, then (give you growth) that ye attain your full 
  strength. And among you there is he who dieth (young), and among you there is 
  he who is brought back to the most abject time of life, so that, after 
  knowledge, he knoweth naught. And thou (Muhammad) seest the earth barren, but 
  when We send down water thereon, it doth thrill and swell and put forth every 
  lovely kind (of growth) (Sura <a name="022.005">Al-Hajj </a>

  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">The verse mentions 
  three primary stages of embryonic development: (1) a “seed,” “drop” or “semen” 
  phase (in Arabic, “nutfah”), (2) followed by a “clot” or “leach-like clot” 
  phase (in Arabic, “Alaqah”), (3) followed finally by a “morsel of flesh” or 
  “chewed lump” phase (in Arabic, “Mudghah”). &nbsp;Some other additional suras can 
  also be cited that deal with this subject, and none seems to disagree with 
  this basic scenario. Again the hadiths, particularly that of Bukhari and 
  Muslim give some relevant information. For e.g, </span>

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">I visited Abu Sariha Hudhaifa b. Usaid al-Ghifari 
  who said: I listened with these two ears of mine Allahs Messenger (may peace 
  be upon him) as saying: <b>The semen stays in the womb for forty nights</b>, 
  then the angel, gives it a shape. Zubair said: I think that he said: One who 
  fashions that and decides whether he would be male or female. Then he (the 
  angel) says: Would his limbs be full or imperfect? And then the Lord makes 
  them full and perfect or otherwise as He desires. Then he says: My Lord, what 
  about his livelihood, and his death and what about his disposition? And then 
  the Lord decides about his misfortune and fortune.</span></p>

  Bukhari Volume 8, Book 77, Number 593, Sahih Bukhari Volume 9, Book 93, Number 
  546 etc. The key information gained from all these above mentioned hadiths are 
  that the three phases (nutfah, alaqah and madghah) takes 40 days each, for a 
  total period of &nbsp;40 + 40 + 40 = 120 days from conception to the point at which 
  the embryo becomes a fetus. After that the blood clot was turned to bone and 
  then God &quot;clothed the bones with flesh&quot; (Qur’an 23:13-14). And finally the 
  gender of the child is assigned by an angel. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; color: #003300">The whole idea is 
  completely erroneous in many ways. First of all, the human embryo becomes a 
  fetus around week 9, i.e, roughly half the time “Islamic embryology” 
  suggests.&nbsp; Again, there are no developmental milestones which can be mapped to 
  the thrice forty day period, even though they are suggested in several 
  authoritative hadiths with full support from Qur’an.&nbsp; Also, from medical 
  science we know in human development process living tissue forms first, and 
  then bones grow at a later time, and it continues to gain strength for many 
  years after birth. But by expressing &quot;blood clot was turned to bone&quot; Qur’an in 
  fact reveals its one of many scientific inaccuracies.</span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">
  Finally, if we check the above cited verses of Qur’an carefully, we will find 
  nowhere in Qur’an it mentions about human egg; instead Qur’an refers to the 
  “drop of seed” solely. This is because most primitive peoples including Arabs 
  thought that the whole child was in the &quot;seed&quot; of the man. The woman was 
  considered simply as the oven or incubator that fully contained in the 
  father’s seed. They could not figure out its existence as no one could find 
  the eggs of the woman at that time. It is a historical fact that prior to the 
  medical community comprehending that women actually have eggs and men have 
  sperm that must be combined to produce a child, it was widely believed that 
  the whole child was contained in the man's seed. This was also Catholic Church 
  doctrine for hundreds of years. Not &quot;spilling one's seed on the ground&quot; is an 
  admonition against masturbation because it was believed that one's children 
  would be eliminated.&nbsp; The majority of Islamic scholars consider it <i>haram</i> 
  (prohibited) too for having direct support from hadith [</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: blue"><a href="#21">21</a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">]. 
  It can be pointed out from Islamic culture that the Shah of Iran divorced her 
  wife Soraya (Soraya Esfandiari Bakhtiari) because of no children. In rural 
  areas of Bangladesh, in similar fashion, many women gets divorced each year 
  because they are wrongly blamed for not being capable of producing male child.

  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #003300">Any 
  reader, who has some common sense and preliminary knowledge of science, knows 
  that sun does not need to have any &quot;rising&quot; or &quot;setting&quot; place, because, sun 
  neither rise, nor does it set.&nbsp; It is the diurnal motion of the earth which 
  makes appear in every place of earth for sun's rising and setting. But it 
  seems that omniscient Allah does not know the simple scientific truth. Allah 
  thought that sun needs a definite rising and setting place and one does need 
  to go to the end of the world to find it rising/setting. This gives an idea 
  the people of Muhammad’s time believed that the Earth is flat and the sun 
  moves in the sky rising from one place and setting in another. </span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">The proof of flat 
  earth is implicit in the instruction for Muslim prayer times. </span>
  <span lang="EN-AU">
  <a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/aroj_ali/profile.htm" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
  Aroj Ali Matubbar</a>, the peasant-philosopher of Bengal has further 
  elaborated on this idea of flat earth in his book ‘<a href="http://www.humanists.net/avijit/aroj_ali/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">The 
  Quest for Truth</a>’ [<span style="color: blue"><a href="#22">22</a></span>]. 
  Let us take this opportunity to examine his elaboration.&nbsp; </span>
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Allah clearly assumes 
  that universality of time and has no concept of &quot;Local Time&quot;. It is found that 
  in almost all religions there are certain fixed hours for certain prayers. But 
  it is not understood why the Lord of the universe should withhold His 
  acceptance if a person says his/her prayers before or after the fixed hours? 
  Islam enjoins saying one’s prayers five times a day at particular hours and 
  there are certain hours when prayers are forbidden. </span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">The diurnal motion of 
  the earth causes difference in the local time of the countries situated in 
  different longitudes as a result of which there is a prayer time at every 
  moment of the day and night in some places or other. Yet it is forbidden to 
  say one’s prayers at sunrise, at 12 noon and at sunset. What is its 
  significance? The sun rises at different hours at different places – earlier 
  in eastern countries and later in the western countries. So when prayers are 
  forbidden here it is not forbidden elsewhere at that particular moment. For 
  instance, when the sun rises in New York, it is yet to rise in Los Angels and 
  it had already risen in London a few hours ago. Thus, when prayers are 
  forbidden at New York, it is not forbidden in L.A. or London. In that case, is 
  there any sense in forbidding prayers at particular hours? </span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">The same question 
  applies to prescribed hours for prayers. Since every moment is a prayer time 
  in some place or other what is the point in fixing certain hours for certain 
  prayers? </span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">There was a time when 
  the Earth was supposed to be flat and stationary which would make the hour of 
  clock at any given moment identical in all the countries or places of the 
  world with no variation in local time. Probably this notion led to the 
  prescribed prayer–schedule. But now it has been proved that the earth is a 
  moving sphere. Let us now discuss the problems arising out of the erroneous 
  notion. </span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">Suppose after saying 
  his afternoon prayer “Zohar” at half past one, a man started for Holly Mecca 
  in Saudi Arabia by plane from Bangladesh flying at a speed of 3000 miles per 
  hour. On reaching there he found that it was yet to be noon. Will he have to 
  say the “Zohar” prayer once again when the appointed time for it comes? </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">If a plane flies west 
  at a speed 1041.67 miles per hour, the sun will appear to be at rest as if it 
  stood motionless at one place and the passengers will have no idea of the time 
  of day – morning, noon or evening – by looking at the sun. In this 
  circumstance, how will the passengers take care of their prayers and fasting?
  </span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">It is only in the 
  equatorial region of the earth that at certain times of the year the days and 
  nights are of equal or nearly equal duration. But the further north and south 
  we travel from this region, the longer are the days or nights depending on the 
  season of the year. In some countries near the arctic region days become so 
  long in summer that soon after dusk the sun rises again with no night between 
  evening and dawn. How will one say one’s Esha prayer there? </span></p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph">
  <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Times New Roman">In the arctic region 
  about six months of continuous daytime is followed by a night lasting for six 
  months. Since we get only one day and one night there it may be possible to 
  say one’s prayers five times a year but how can one fast there for thirty days 
  from dawn to dusk? &nbsp;This is proof enough that Allah was not knowledgeable 
  about the reality of the Earth, and probably considered the Earth as flat.
