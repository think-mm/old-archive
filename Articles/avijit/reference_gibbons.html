<p><font color="#008000">The reason why we have organizations such as the <b>

paper even hints at intelligent design or in any way questions Darwinism, then 
it is rejected. The executive editor of Scientific American, Mariette

she is not even willing to publish creationist letters, an attitude adopted by

<p>Mr. Gibbons has a remarkable talent for packing an enormous amount of 
stupidity into a few brief sentences. Please tell him so for me. I am a mere 
mathematician, rather than a biologists, but I shall try to point out a few of 
his more absurd errors. Pointing out all of them, in appropriate detail, would, 
I fear, exhaust the supply of photons available for e-mail traffic.</p>
<p>[Gibbons]</p>
<p>&gt; Indeed, Darwiin himself &gt; was untrained in any of the sciences, possessing 
only a degree in &gt;theology from Cambridge. </p>
<p>[Response]</p>
<p>In Darwin's generation, Oxford and Cambridge didn't train &quot;scientists&quot; as 
such. Mathematics was a typical &quot;major&quot;, but taught from an obsolete curriculum 
that left English mathematics far behind what was happening in France and 
Germany at the time. But a mathematician typically took a degree in Divinity.
</p>
<p>But this is all by the by; the fact that Darwin had no formal degree was 
simply not of much importance. When his researches on the &quot;Beagle&quot; were 
published, he became one of the most famous and respected natural scientists in 
Europe, a reputation that was more than secure before he published anything on 
natural selection. </p>
<p>[Gibbons]</p>
<p>&gt;His ideas were thrown out by scientists of the day, but were eventually 
&gt;embraced by the secular mind as it presented a theory of origins that puts &gt;a 
creator or designer out of the picture. In other words, no accountability &gt;to a 
Higher Being. &gt;You mentioned that it looks more likely that humans evolved from 
an ape. &gt;Genetics does not support this jackalopian nonsense no matter how hard 
you &gt;try to manipulate the evidence. The fossil record would be packed with 
&gt;untold millions of transitional forms of all species if evolution is true.&gt; </p>
<p>[Response]</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that speciation often, if not always, occurs in small, 
isolated local populations over relatively brief periods of time. So no matter 
how efficient fossil preservation, one would not expect to see a closely-graded 
continuum of forms. By the way, this model of speciation differs markedly from 
Darwin's, giving the lie to Gibbons's foolish contention that today's 
evolutionary biologists slavishly accept all of Darwin in every particular. </p>
<p>&quot;Transitional form&quot; is a term relative to different species and denotes an 
historically and morphologically intermediate species which retains, often 
atavistically, features of the older species that have disappeared in the 
younger. There is absolutely no reason to assume that The fossil record is 
replete with striking sequences of intermediate forms--whales, for instance, 
that were fully aquatic but retain something of the skeletal structure of legs 
and feet that their incompletely aquatic ancestors used to get around on dry 
land, but which have essentially disappeared in modern forms. There are a 
considerable number of clearly transitional avians known at this point, in 
varying degrees intermediate between therapod saurischian dinosaurs and modern 
birds. A few dozen of these were on plain view in the London Natural History 
Museum a couple of years ago. Of course, since then, dinosaurs with avain 
feathers have been unearthed. </p>
<p>[Gibbons]</p>
<p>&gt;Instead we find that all fossils are complete, complex and fully functional 
&gt;with no transitional examples. Fossil birds are found in the upper &gt;Triassic - 
75 million years prior to archaeopteryx, and a major new species &gt;of mammal (Repenomamus 
robustus) was recently discovered that fed on young &gt;dinosaurs.?&gt; </p>
<p>[Response]</p>
<p>So goddam what? This is utterly irrelevant as refutation of 
&quot;Darwinism&quot;--indeed, it supports it. In the 1870's, when archaeopteryx first 
turned up, there was a premature but understandable inclination to view it as a 
direct ancestor of modern birds. But it isn't; it belongs to a distinct line 
that diverged early from that of modern birds and retained more &quot;reptilian&quot; 
features. This line has died out. Likewise, the existence of Reponomamus merely 
points up the fact that natural selection and speciation are prolific and 
ongoing processes at all times in all populations. Note that this example, too, 
represents a lineage that has no modern descendants. </p>
<p>There is absolutely no reason to assume, by the way, that &quot;transitional 
forms&quot; are anything but fully functional, comples, and excellently adapted to 
their particular enviornments. &quot;Transitional&quot; doesn't mean imperfect or anything 
like that. It is merely a relational term describing intermediate status between 
forms. </p>
<p>[Gibbons]</p>
<p>&gt;Discoveries like this do not conform to Darwinian theories.&gt; </p>
<p>[Response]</p>
<p>In the sense that phenomena like allopatric speciation, genetic drift, and 
hybridization are granted a role, they don conform to &quot;strict&quot; Darwinian theory. 
Which is only to say that modern evolutionary theory, despite the enormous debt 
owed to Darwin and Wallace, regards the &quot;founders&quot; not as divine authority, but 
as scientists whose theories, like those of other men and women, are subject to 
correction and modification even if the main thrust is highly confirmed. </p>
<p>However, in any sense that matters, the discoveries cited conform excellently 
to Darwin's main ideas. Darwin has been one of the most extraordinarily 
fortunate scientists in respect to the way the objective evidence produced by 
newer generations has upheld his chief ideas. </p>
<p>[Gibbons]</p>
<p>&gt;Whale evolution is no better, when Darwinists claim that a piece of skull, 
&gt;a part of jawbone and three teeth belonged to a &quot;walking whale,&quot; without &gt;any 
knowledge of the creatures precise locomotion ,feeding habits or &gt;habitat, then 
you are grasping at straws.? </p>
<p>[response]</p>
<p>This is an extremely stupid example, since the fossil record of whales is 
extraordinarily complete. The same is true, by dumb luck, for human beings, 
whose history is replete with known transitional forms. </p>
<p>[Gibbons]</p>
<p>&gt; &gt;But we mustn't question Darwinism too closely, after all that would be 
&gt;&quot;unscientific&quot; wouldn't it? &gt; </p>
<p>[Response] </p>
<p>See above. </p>
<p>Overall advice to Mr. Gibbon: stop acting like a goddam moron! </p>
<p>Norman Levitt</p>
<hr>
<p>I liked Richard Dawkins' argument in his book &quot;The Ancestor's Tale.&quot; He 
pointed out that evolution is so well established by other means (embryology, 
DNA comparisons, observations of evolution in action, etc.) that it could not 
seriously be questioned even if no one had ever seen a fossil. Fossils are just 
an extra added bonus. Maybe we should refuse to discuss fossils with 
creationists and ask them to explain the other evidence.</p>

<p>We and all things alive are actually &quot;transitional&quot; forms. So if Gibbon wants 
to see a transitional form, all he has to do is look in the mirror. </p>

<hr>
<p>I read the first part of the anit-evolutionist junk that you posted.&nbsp; 
There are so many mistakes -- and complete misunderstanding of basic 
paleontological principles. </p>
<p>Mammmals and dinosaurs both 1st appeared during the Carnian, which is the 
first age in the upper Triassic epoch. It lasted from 228-216.5mya. Mammals 
apparently evolved from one of the species of cynodonts, that had evolved 
progressively mammalian traits from the late Permian to the Ladinian 
(237-228mya) in the Middle Triassic. Cynodants had themselves evolved from the 
so-called &quot;mammal-like reptiles&quot;, the therapsids. </p>
<p>At about 220mya there was a rather extensive &quot;End Triassic&quot; extinction, which 
affected some of the species found in the fossil record. However, during the 
next Triassic age, the Norian (216.5-203.9mya), both mammals and dinosaurs 
started to flourish. Mammals kept small and nocturnal, and likely did eat the 
eggs of smaller dinosaurs. </p>
<p>Reptiles had evolved from the tetrapods in the Upper Carboniferous, or 
Pennsylvanian. The Archosaurs were a very early branch of reptiles. They 
included 1) the extinct relatives of crocodiles and 2) the Ornithousuchia (which 
included the pterosaurs, dinosaurs, later the birds). Pterosaurs were 
dinosaur-like archosaurs that evolved the ability to fly. They were NOT birds. 
Birds, as we know them, did not evolve until the Jurrasic. </p>
<p>The dinosaurs evolved in two groups, the Sauropsids (lizard-hipped) and the 
Orinthpsids (bird-hipped). The T-Rex was one of the latter group. I could go on, 
but it isn't necessary. Apparently the creationist authors never heard of 
convergent evolution, where two separate groups of animals evolve an anotomical 
function, a trait or an ability, not because they are related, but because they 
are solving a similar problem. </p>
<p>There were flying Pterosaurs in the Triassic, but they were not birds, and 
didnt evoilve into modern birds. They were flying dinosaurs. And it's no 
surprise the late Triassic mammals interacted with late Triassic dinosaurs -- 
they both first evolved during the same geological epoch - and even during the 
same age, the Carnian. </p>
<p>I could have given more detail if I looked up the various relationships. The 
evolutionary line of descent is not strictly linear, like the creationists would 
prefer us to believe. It is like a bush, speading out over time, with organisms 
continually adapting to better survive the environment that confronts them. </p>
<p>I can give you references if you would like. Let me know and I'll find the 
books and references that will provide you with good feedback. I recall most of 
their names, but not the publisher, etc. And the relationships are more 
complicated than I outlined. I simply provided the general outline of events and 
relationships. </p>
<p>I hope that this helps. God, it make me so mad how creationists warp 
contemporary evolutionary theory, as well as the fossil record. Don't they 
realize that evolution, as a science, has advanced in the past 150 years? And 
even his statement about Darwin's ideas being &quot;thrown out&quot; by the scientists of 
the day -- where does he get such ripe. Sure, there were some that had problems 
with the theory, and rightly so. But most scientists had adopted Darwinism by 
the end of the 19th century. </p>

<p>I am getting tired of arguing with creationists. Why don't we just ignore 
them, like we ignore flat-earthers. </p>
<p>I know what you are going to say. We are engaged in a big political battle, 
blah, blah. Then the argument is political, not scientific. That is, we need not 
address any of the complex pseudoscientific arguments they come up with. Most 
people don't understand them anyway. All we have to keep saying is that no 
scientific dispute exists. When the politicians say &quot;teach the controversy&quot; say 
&quot;what controversy?&quot; Sure, go a head and teach the political controversy in 
classes on politics, but keep that out of science classes. </p>

<p>The original article that I wrote against &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; (read: Hebrew 
God) hardly had any derogatory remarks in it. Still then, you decided to 
challenge me as if the Lord has given the onus on you to go after Darwinist. I 
as a secularist do not like to challenge people for their blind belief. But that 
is hardly the case with the creationists. They love to go after whoever is 
against their Biblical dogma. The Hindus have their own account of Genesis. Why 
not go after them. But no! Creationists love to hate the secularists. For a good 
reason. Because like a child they said, &quot;The Emperor has no clothes on!&quot;</p>

<p>No, the dice had never been loaded against the religionists. One group is 
trying hard to seek the truth about evolution. The other group first believed in 
some folklore stuff and then looking for some flimsy clues to propound the 
Biblical story. You guys could float your own &quot;scientific journal&quot; and ask all 
the &quot;scholars&quot; belonging to Creationist camp to write original articles on their 
pet belief system. I am doing science for over 35 years (31 years after having 
my doctoral degree) but I hardly know the super scientists the Creationist 
revere. BTW, if Mr. Rufus Porter would be alive today, he would have embraced 
Darwinism right away. Mr. Darwin had an open mind, lest we forget. He went to 
Cambridge to study theology but we all know what happened to him. He became 
enlightened reading naturalists of his time. There is no conspiracy theory here 
about the unprecedented growth of Darwinism. Secularists accepted Darwin’s 
work because it made sense as opposed to biblical mumbo-jumbo. </p>

<p>Ullah replies: </p>
<p>Do you read articles written by present-day scientists who are doing work in 
genomics? I work on an enzyme call phytase (it breaks down phytic acid, a 
phosphorylated sugar present in beans, legumes, cereals, etc). When I did 
protein sequence comparisons of all phytases present in bacteria, yeast, fungi, 
I see how the enzyme evolved over millions of year. Human being do not have 
phytase but they have a variation of the gene with astounding sequence 
similarities. God will not play games with us! Go read these new articles and 
you will become a fast convert. The foundation of modern day biology rests on 
Darwinism. Period. The problem with educated Christians is as follows: they do 
not question the scientists who discovers truth about physics, chemistry, etc., 
because those truths are used to make things such as computers, cars, and 
myriads of things to make their life easy. They even do not mind the scientists 
who are bringing new medicines (read antibiotics) to cure chronic and infectious 
disease. But all hell breaks loose when one talks about Darwin. Simply because 
Darwin’s finding showed glaringly all the inanities in Bible, Koran, etc. You 
are bringing to fore those anomalies in evolution to tell us that Darwin’s 
findings are all wrong. Why do you have so negative view, Mr. Gibbons? The 
advent of molecular biology has brought a deluge of new information. Cloning is 
now possible, which was unheard of up until 1970s. When restriction nucleases 
were discovered in mid 1970s, the scientists learned how to cut gene and splice 
them. Some scientists or team of scientists will clone human in near future and 
then what will happen? Secular humanism is going to be the “religion” in 
future no matter what you creationists think. Seek knowledge and truth. At least 
you will find solace in your heart. </p>
