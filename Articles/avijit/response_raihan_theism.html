&gt; The &quot;3O&quot; God was a misunderstanding (sorry for that) but it has no correlation 
with my article, anyway.<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; I think &quot;3O&quot; issue has been explained elsewhere. Moreover, beside &quot;3O&quot;, GOD 
does have many other <br>
&gt;attributes as well, according to Quran (for example). </p>
<p>Response: I am not interested about Quran at all. I thought your article was 
dealing with the issues of theism and atheism in a generic sense, hence I showed 
interest. If your intention is to debate on&nbsp; Quran, then change the title 
of the thread. If you try to prove God's existence through Quran, and then again 
Quran's divinity by&nbsp; accepting the existence of God, then you are in the 
circle. Moreover, (various concepts) of God was there long before Quran came to 
us. </p>
<p>Anyway, thanks that you realized that you had misunderstood the concept of &quot;3O God&quot;. Prof Stenger mentioned it 
twice in his slide very precisely. What expected was you would read the slides 
carefully and then write.</p>
<p><br>
[Raihan] Moreover his last five points have not yet been proven scientifically:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. Universe can arise from a quantum fluctuation..... .<br>
&gt; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response: Perhaps your knowledge is not updated about modern physics. No 
scientist are saying that Universe has definitely arose thru a quantum 
fluctuation, what they are saying that it 'can' arise thru quantum fluctuation, 
naturally. Kindly note that no scientific theory relies on any 'absolute truth',&nbsp; not theory 
of gravity, quantum fluctuation, not string theory. That's why science in not a 'dogma'. 
Anyway,&nbsp; If we look at latest findings of astrophysics, the beginning of 
the universe can be explained through the theological significance of 
Inflationary Cosmology (which has been accepted by many renowned physicists at 
this time) and it is as follows: it shows- how the universe might have formed 
out of nothing, in complete chaos (maximum entropy), and have order formed 
spontaneously without violating any known laws of physics. That is to say- it 
provides an economical explanation about the origin of the universe without 
creation or design hypothesis.</p>
<p>Indeed a universe can arise through a quantum fluctuation and Edward Tryon 
was first to publish this idea in Nature, the lone of the leading scientific 
journal in 1973. With appearance of the inflationary cosmology in 80s, several 
physicists developed models in which inflation is triggered by an initial 
quantum event. Here are some: </p>
<p>David Atkatz and Heinz Pagels, &quot;Origin of universe as Quantum Tunneling 
effect&quot; Physical review D25 (1982): 2065-73; </p>
<p>S.W. Hawking and I.G.Moss &quot;Supercooled Phase Transitions in the very early 
Universe&quot;, Physics letters B110(1982):35-38; </p>
<p>Alexander Vilenkin, &quot;Creation of Universe from Nothing&quot; Physics letters 117B 
(1982) 25-28, </p>
<p>Andre Linde, &quot;Quantum creation of the inflammatory Universe,&quot; Letter Al Nuovo 
Cimento 39(1984): 401-405 etc.</p>
<p>I am giving a link of Alexander Vilenkin's paper describing&nbsp; a 
mathematical derivation of how Universe can arise from nothing through quantum 
tunneling process. This is one of his earliest works and was published in the 
reputed physics journal, Physics Letters. </p>

<p>Also take a look on the following paper of A. Velenkin, &quot;Quantum Origin of 
the Universe&quot;, published in Nuclear Physics, B252 (1985), pp 141-152 :</p>

https://gold.mukto-mona.com/science/physics/a_vilinkin/quantum_origin_universe.pdf</a> </p>
<p>Prof. Victor Steger has also written a paper describing mathematical models 
of A Scenario for a Natural Origin of Our Universe:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Godless/Origin.pdf">
http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Godless/Origin.pdf</a> </p>
<p>Alan Guth, the father of Inflationary model has written a book (&quot;The 
inflationary Universe) for lay people describing how the whole universe can come 
out out of nothing in a natural quantum process.&nbsp; Kindly check out the book 
from your library and read it. </p>
<p>If you think the universe cannot arise through natural process mentioned 
above, burden of proof lies upon your shoulder to point out the mistakes of the 
above models.&nbsp; Mind it, those papers were all published in peer-reviewed 
journals.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By calling their work &quot;unscientific&quot;, you are basically ignoring established 
scientific facts and phrasing your own dogmatic belief.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raihan:</p>
<p>&gt;Some of his arguments seem 
rather trivial. <br>
&gt; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Response: As if this statement could refute Prof Stenger's any of the 
argument! One can use the same preposterous words for your Bangla article too. 
:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <br>
Raihan:<br>
&gt; Well, then how Prof Stenger says “How science shows that God does not exist” 
in the first place! I don't <br>
&gt;think any sensible person would say that GOD's issue 
is purely scientific. <br>
&gt; </p>
<p> <br>
Response: Read the slides once again, you will get the answer. Prof Stenger 
clearly stated that his attempt was to refute&nbsp; presumed attributes (such as 
Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnibenevolent, perfect, which are commonly used to 
define God. Those attributes clearly suffers from logical inconsistency.&nbsp; 
If you do not understand the issue, here are some other link as well :</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/incompatible.html">
http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/incompatible.html</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/james_still/evil.html">

<p><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/michael_martin/logic.html">

<p><a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/graham_oppy/god.html">
http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/graham_oppy/god.html</a> </p>
<p>So the issue is,&nbsp; the term 'God' cannot be defined in a consistent way, 
cause, its attributes suffers from various logical contradictions. What Prof 
Stenger points - the term God needs some logically inconsistent attributes, 
thus it does not exist, just as a &quot;squared circle&quot; does not exist. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question to ponder :</p>
<p>1. Is any natural explanation of creation of universe in scientific 
literature and papers exist? </p>
<p>2. Can anyone prove God's existence scientifically? </p>
<p>If the answer of the first question is 'yes' and the second answer is 'no', 
then no need to continue the debate. The case dismissed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Raihan] &gt; My article addresses (dozens of) varieties of issues. For example, 
it has exhaustively refuted the notion of &quot;multiple gods&quot; for the first time (I 
suppose) that many people have been using for centuries....the article still 
stands on many other points.<br>
&gt; <br>
Response: Kindly read philosophy and science in details before bragging about 
your own article, this is just my humble suggestion. I see you quoted Dawkins 
probably from a third party source in your article, without even reading a 
single book of Dawkins. I am sure if I challenge you you will not be able to 
point out the source from Dawkin's book. You also wrongly address Einstein's 
philosophy. So, before calling that your articles addressed some issues for 
&quot;first time&quot; you need to know the philosophy of Brihospoti, Charvaka, Dheeshan, 
Buddha, Nagarjun, Thales, Democritus, Anaximenes, Heraklitos, Hipocritus,&nbsp; 
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Lock, Hume, Beckon, Nietzsche, Russel, Einstein, 
Darwin, Hawking, Dawkins and many others.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the arguments 
for the Existence of a God (such as design argument, cosmological arguments, 
moral argument, ontological argument, transcendental argument etc.)&nbsp; has 
been refuted long ago. You did not address any new issue as theistic argument in 
your article.</p>
