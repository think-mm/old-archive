<title>Thanks for your mail Mr</title>

<body>

<p>Thanks for your mail Mr. Hasan.&nbsp; Besides your personal attack in your 
write-up (as always), you have quoted several points wrongly. Just consider 
these:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; The truth (or lie) of an assertion doesn't depend on from where 
&quot;Avijit is sitting&quot;, be it Singapore, Nepal or Bhutan. This is known as 
circumstantial argumentum ad hominem.</p>
<p>2) My message has nothing to do with Jamal Hasan, Asghar or Alamgir. Almost 
all the cases I differ with their opinion, especially on the issue of supporting 
US foreign policy, supporting Bush or Deniel pies etc.&nbsp; I think I have 
stated it many times openly. Introducing irrelevant material to the issue being 
discussed wont help much.</p>
<p>3) Criticizing a dogma and Muslims are not the same for me. I have made the 
distinction between Muslims and Islam. Muslims are people, human beings like you 
and I with hopes and aspirations that characterizes all of us humans; but Islam 
is the doctrine and one has right to criticize.&nbsp; Though I have criticized 
Islam (like other doctrine such as Hinduism or Christianity) in few occasions, I 
never demean the struggle of Muslims while they are oppressed.&nbsp; You may 
check my stand on Kashmir, Palastine, US election etc.&nbsp; Following links 
will help you understand :</p>

<p>4) Regarding Prof Churchill's comment, I would say, any killing of innocent 
people - whether it is of Bangladeshi, Americans, Afghans, Palestinians, Jews, 
Africans, Burmese or any other nationality is bound to cause strong feelings of 
revulsion among all thinking people. Again, I don't support any decision to get 
him fired from the job just for his comments, though I would say his comment was 
rather sloppy. Again it is my personal view, you do not have to agree on that. 
Lucky that he did not have a fate like Dr. Humayun Azad. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you will feel better now.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Avijit</p>

Sitting in Singapore Avijit Roy, (Author of an open challenge to <br>
Muslims about <br>
their religion),&nbsp; is lecturing us about the freedom of speech in the <br>
United <br>
States. This pseudo-humanist is behind organizing a gang of anti-muslim <br>
fanatics around the globe to incinuate hatred.<br>

&nbsp;His partner Dr. Alamgir Hussain and and ex-Boss Jamal Hasan (Mohammad <br>

<br>
<br>
He drops a few names like Chomsky and Ali for cosmetic reasons,&nbsp; but <br>
most of <br>
his writings are directed against a religion that is supposedly <br>
inherently <br>
fundamentalist. The distinction between religion and religious <br>
fundamentalism <br>
is not made.&nbsp; He has written in Christian forums attacking Muslims.<br>

Let us read the following. Whatever prejudice Prof. Churchill here is <br>
spewing <br>
is off limits to disection,for now, if Avijit's assertion is,&nbsp; <br>
simply,that no <br>
one threatens anyone of bodily harm in the United states, for their <br>
views.<br>
It only happens in our Bangladesh.<br>

N.Y. college cancels Churchill's appearance amid death threat<br>
<br>
<br>
By The Associated Press<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Clinton, N.Y. - Citing death threats, an upstate New York college today <br>
canceled a panel discussion featuring University of Colorado professor <br>
Ward <br>
Churchill, who compared victims of the World Trade Center terror attack <br>
to <br>
Nazis in an essay.<br>
<br>
Also today, Gov. Bill Owens called on Churchill to resign his CU <br>
faculty <br>
position, saying taxpayers shouldn't have to subsidize &quot;outrageous and <br>
insupportable&quot; views that defy the facts of history.<br>
<br>
Churchill resigned Monday as chairman of CU's ethnic studies department <br>
but <br>
remains a teacher.<br>
<br>
Hamilton College spokesman Michael DeBraggio said multiple death <br>
threats were <br>
made against both college officials and Churchill, who was to have <br>
spoken at <br>
the campus Thursday.<br>
<br>
In an essay written after the Sept. 11 attacks, Churchill said the <br>
trade <br>
center victims were &quot;little Eichmanns,&quot; a reference to Adolf Eichmann, <br>
who <br>
organized Nazi plans to exterminate Europe's Jews.<br>
<br>
Churchill also spoke of the &quot;gallant sacrifices&quot; of the &quot;combat teams&quot; <br>
that <br>
struck America in the terror attacks.<br>
<br>
The essay attracted little attention until Churchill was invited to <br>
speak at <br>
Hamilton College, 40 miles east of Syracuse, N.Y.<br>
<br>
Administrators at first moved the scheduled appearance to a building <br>
that can <br>
seat 2,000, instead of the originally planned 300.<br>
<br>
Hamilton College President Joan Hinde Stewart had said the college was <br>
committed to free speech, “however repugnant one might find Mr. <br>
Churchill’s <br>
remarks.” CHURCHILL RESIGNS&nbsp; <br>
Essay and video<br>
<br>
Click here to see Ward Churchill's essay, &quot;Some People Push Back: On <br>
the <br>
Justice of Roosting Chickens,&quot; as posted on a third-party website. Todd <br>
Gleeson, dean of the University of Colorado's College of Arts and <br>
Sciences, <br>
which oversees Churchill's department, has indicated to The Denver Post <br>
that <br>
this posting is an authentic copy of Churchill's essay.<br>

<br>
But today, Stewart sent an e-mail to students, faculty and staff saying <br>
the <br>
college had a “higher responsibility ... and that is the safety and <br>
security” <br>
of the campus community. She said the threats were “credible” and had <br>
been <br>
turned over to police.<br>
<br>
In his resignation letter as department chair, Churchill said &quot;the <br>
present <br>
political climate has rendered me a liability in terms of representing <br>
either <br>
my department, the college, or the university.&quot;<br>
<br>
He will remain a teacher at CU, though the school's Board of Regents <br>
have <br>
scheduled an emergency meeting for Thursday to discuss the tenured <br>
professor.<br>
<br>
University officials welcomed the resignation.<br>
<br>
&quot;While Professor Churchill has the constitutional right to express his <br>
political views, his essay on 9/11 has outraged and appalled us and the <br>
general public,&quot; interim Chancellor Phil DiStefano said in a statement.<br>
<br>
In a letter to CU's College Republicans released today, Owens asked for <br>
Churchill's resignation as a teacher.<br>
<br>
&quot;The thousands of innocent people - and innocent they were - who were <br>
murdered <br>
on September 11 were murdered by evil cowards,&quot; the governor's letter <br>
said. <br>
&quot;Indeed, if anyone could possibly be compared to the evildoers of Nazi <br>
Germany, it is the terrorists of the 21st century who have an equally <br>
repugnant disregard for human life.&quot;<br>
<br>
In interviews and a written statement, Churchill has said he is not an <br>
advocate of violence and was addressing the reasons behind the Sept. 11 <br>
attacks.<br>
<br>
&quot;The overriding question that was being posed at the time was 'why did <br>
this <br>
happen, why did they hate us so much,' and my premise was when you do <br>
this to <br>
other people's families and children, that is going to be a natural <br>
response,&quot; <br>
he said in a television interview Monday.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of relatives of Sept. 11 victims protested Churchill's <br>
scheduled <br>
appearance and Gov. George Pataki said Hamilton officials made a <br>
mistake in <br>
inviting Churchill.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am appalled first that this person with such a warped sense of right <br>
and <br>
wrong and of humanity teaches at a higher education institution <br>
anywhere in <br>
America,&quot; Pataki said. &quot;But I am equally, or perhaps even more, <br>
appalled that <br>
Hamilton College in this state has invited that person to participate <br>
in a <br>
forum. It is wrong. There is a difference between freedom of speech and <br>
inviting a bigoted terrorist supporter.&quot;<br>
