&gt; &quot;Sunil and Buddha may have changed their stand about<br>
&gt; Tagore, but there are many scholars both in east and<br>
&gt; west including Humayun Azad,-----,Bertrand Russell, et<br>
&gt; al were very negative about Tagore life long.&quot;---AR <br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 1. Were they &quot;very negative&quot; to such an extent that<br>
&gt; they totally rejected Rabindranath and his works? I<br>
&gt; don't think so. <br>
<br>
Some in the list&nbsp; indeed were very negative on Rabindranth. However, I 
think there is a difference b/n &quot;being negative about Tagore&quot;&nbsp; 
and &quot;rejecting all works&quot;. The initial issue of our debate was on how Rabindranath 
viewed women in general. Criticizing Tagore's one position is &quot;NOT EQUAL&quot; to 
rejecting all of his work. We all aware of his contribution. Nobody 
here said that one should reject all of his work! Even Humayun Azad who appeared 
as a great critique on the Tagore's feminism issue we are discussing, did not dare to say that he 
rejected all of his literary work. The point, I am afraid, is merely irrelevant. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dr. Ahmad Shariff has written an<br>
&gt; article focusing on all the negative aspects about<br>
&gt; Rabindranth's life and works. For example, he has<br>
&gt; complained that Rabindranath, despite the ample<br>
&gt; opportunity to meet Marx while both Marx and he were<br>
&gt; living in London during a certain period of time,<br>
&gt; showed no curiosity about Marx. However, in the same<br>
&gt; article he has described his post-Nobel period of 28<br>
&gt; years as the golden period of his creativity.<br>
<br>
<br>
Again the issue is irrelevant. Who suggested&nbsp; that Ahmed Sharif rejected 
all of his contribution? <br>
<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 2. I know only two cases in which Rabindranath was<br>
&gt; rejected completely. One, during Pakistan time, the<br>
&gt; ruling coterie made an attempt to inspire Bengalis to<br>
&gt; boycot Rabindranath completely although with not much<br>
&gt; success. Second, Indian communists made a call to<br>
&gt; reject this &quot;bourgeios&quot; writer. We know Vidyasagar was<br>
&gt; also not spared.<br>
<br>
So what's the point? We are aware that Rabindranath was banned in Pakistani 
period. But just because he was banned in Pakistani period or Mullahs hate him 
does not necessarily imply that he's above all criticism.<br>
<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; 3. It is possible to quote from here and there to<br>
&gt; prove that Rabindranath was not a progressive man. But<br>
&gt; a man and his works have to be judged from a greater<br>
&gt; perspective. Can we really ignore these general<br>
&gt; truths?<br>
&gt; ---His vehement protest against the Jalianwalabag<br>
&gt; massacre.<br>
&gt; ---His active protest against the Bengal partition in<br>
&gt; 1905 and work for Hindu-Muslim unity.<br>
&gt; ---All his literary works criticizing caste system and<br>
&gt; other religious sanctions that strip humans of all<br>
&gt; dignities.<br>
&gt; ---His anti-imperialist stance (against Japanese<br>
&gt; aggression, for example).<br>
&gt; ---He was impressed by the economic justice that the<br>
&gt; Soviet system tried to implement.<br>
&gt; There are more.<br>
&gt;<br>
<br>
I am at a loss to understand why the above issues are being raised. We are aware 
of all the points quoted here. We were not in a duty to judge Tagore's character 
- how good Tagore was or how bad he was in this particular thread. We were 
discussing a particular topic related to Tagore's view on women.&nbsp; It has no 
relation with&nbsp; Jalianwalabag or Bengal partition. Yes- One can protest Jalianwalabag massacre at the same time can 
hold a very traditional view towards women. These two are not mutually 
exclusive.<br>
<br>
As you cited all his plus points, I could have also cited all his negative deeds 
including what he did to hinder the marriage of&nbsp; Shahana Devi, the widower 
of Balendranath, or what&nbsp; fanatic reactionary stand he took (even citing 
Manu Shanghita) against Kunjalal Ghosh, a teacher of Santiniketon who was later 
forced to leave,&nbsp; or his imperialist attitude in his own country (read what 
he wrote in &quot;Kalantor&quot; glorifying&nbsp; &quot;Rajaar Jaat&quot; British rulers, and it was 
after Jalianwalabag massacre, not before). One particular letter&nbsp; can be of 
your interest :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but again, these issues were not under discussion.
<br>
<br>
&gt; 4. After reading Rabindranath, one is sure to turn<br>
&gt; into a better human being. That's enough to prove that<br>
&gt; he was definitely a progressive man and quite ahead of<br>
&gt; his own time.<br>
<br>
May be this is your analysis. The conclusion you made -&quot;After reading 
Rabindranath, one is sure to turn&nbsp; into a better human being &quot; is 
subjective. One can be good with or without reading rabindranath Tagore.&nbsp; 
Again issue is misleading. And regarding your other point, Bonna already showed 
very clearly that at least in case of women lib, his view was traditional, not 
at all ahead of time. <br>
