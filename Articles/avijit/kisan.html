<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Let me address 2 most
important things first and then I’ll go ahead with MM web page policy. First
of all, I did not take any of your criticism/comment<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>personally at all, but I took the opportunity to ask you questions to
clarify your questions as I did not understand much from your first email. I am
still confused about the ‘minority’ you are hinting at in every reply; who
are they? Why aren’t they, themselves, voicing their concerns instead of
bypassing through others? MM is a platform of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>people with diverse backgrounds and ideologies who have come together on
the basis of some common backgrounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly<b>,
nobody has suggested you to unsubscribe</b>, I would request you not to take it
so personally, as it deafest the purpose of having debates on issues.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Now about MM web page….&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: red">You
said &gt;&gt;My point is more about articles that are not selected for the
frontpage. I don't have issue with any particular article that is posted but
more with what isn't selected. Actually if you reread my mails you might notice
that I mentioned omission originally.</span><span style="color: black"> <o:p>

<blockquote>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">I
  think I am following the common norm that the sites like FFI/Vinnomot has been
  following for long. &nbsp; To be frank,&nbsp;in those sites associated the
  web-owners take the onus for selection (and omission) of&nbsp; the article(s)
  for the main page (Check for e.g.,&nbsp; - Dr. Ali Sina also follow the same
  method for FFI, and I don't think his liking and disliking always reflect the
  wide variation of his forum either; same goes to vinnomot editor Quddus Khan).
  It is very difficult to overcome all type of bias, if everything has been done
  single-handed. Moreover, initially this MM web site was developed basically as
  a personal interest of mine (without seeking any help from others), while the
  pace and web-features generously donated by Alan Levin upon my personal
  request to uphold my personal philosophy of secular humanism which was then
  very precious to me. I did not build this mukto-mona web-site to keep
  &quot;variety of posts&quot; or &quot;wider diversity of opinions.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>I am glad that many good-hearted diverse people gathered after Mukto-Mona
  platform has been created (I did not expect such enthusiasm, to tell you
  frankly) and I am proud to give them every opportunity to discuss on any
  matter they want. While the MM forum and publication have grown much larger
  and taken a shape of an organization with the involvement and subscription
  from MM well wishers, I would like to preserve MM web page as personal effort
  voicing my chain of thoughts. Though I have tried my best to post variety of
  articles in there too keep the diversity and keep our friends happy, needless
  to say,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have been developing
  this site of my own interest:&nbsp; every author's section, article section
  and every single stuff in that site has been created by me, single handed and
  voluntarily. I may seek advise and suggestion from my friends and well-wishers
  (and in many case I love to do), however, I would like to preserve the
  ultimate right to take the decision about mukto-mona.com site, despite many
  diverse opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">To
  be frank every web-owner do the same. For example Dr. Ali Sina did not publish
  <i>Jahed's rebuttal to Ali Sina</i> in his site on the eve of US election,
  even though I personally sent that article to his account as well as his
  forum. Does Ali publish any&nbsp; Islamist's article even though I know there
  are quite a good numbers of Islamists in his forum? Certainly not.&nbsp; Did
  Ali's site properly reflect the so-called &quot;wider diversity of
  opinions&quot; during the last US election? No, not at all. It reflected Ali's
  own judgment, choice, preference and his chain of thoughts. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">Also
  our resources having members with technical know-how to update the page are
  limited. I get only very few people's help (occasionally) for updating our
  site. At this point let me express my gratitude to Alamgir who sometimes help
  me to update the web (voluntarily), especially when I am busy or absent for
  some time. Normally I do not interfere when others take charge to update
  articles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">I
  might as well address another problem here. Many of the members closely
  associated with MM have been sending articles to my personal account. It is
  becoming impossible for me to post them personally in MM. As a result, the
  posting of these articles have been delayed for obvious reason. In recent
  days, I have sent some of these articles back to their owners to be sent
  directly to MM forum.<o:p>

</span></font></p>
<p style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: red">Another
point you make is that perhaps I find Miraj's article flattering of you? Maybe
this is a joke on your behalf? I don't find it flattering or anything. This
isn't about a personal criticism of you Avijit or anyone else. I hope you could
take it as just a feedback and issue based and not anything personal about
flattering or criticising anybody.</span><span style="color: black"><o:p>

<blockquote>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">Read
  your first mail in this thread where you clearly used one Miraaj Rahman's
  support as a criterion of your disappointment on &quot;marked change&quot; of
  our policy. I do not think it is sensible to make Miraj's comment such a big
  issue. To be frank,&nbsp; his support does not mean anything to me. If you try
  to prove citing one Miraaj Rahman's&nbsp; support that we are in the wrong
  direction, then please know that, we’ve also got tremendous support recently
  from the people like Robin Khundkar, M RS, Mahbub Kamal, Subimal, Nondini and
  many other neutral but progressive members (In fact Robin just talked to us
  yesterday expressing his high satisfaction). Most of them are atheist,
  agnostics and liberal freethinkers.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;to dwell with one comment
  of one Miraaj Rahman (not sure whether he is a muslim fanatic either) to make
  it a big issue is meaningless. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;Now
  I would like to address my plan on the new web page that Bonna is designing (Jahed
  and others are looking at other important matters such as communicating to
  some celebrity author, prominent organization etc), as per my request, with a
  professional web designer. We are planning to launch it in Jan/2005 is
  everything goes according to the plan. While almost everything gets posted in
  the forum, We will be following very strict guidelines in this new web page.
  We have not formalized the guidelines yet, but I will share some of the rules
  I have in mind.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><i><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">-
  No debates will be posted in this new article section unless the writer
  decides to change the debates in an article format. We will have a separate
  section for recent debates.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></i></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><i><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">-
  Articles with personal attacks, personal addressing will not be posted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The editors will reject any article which contains any kind of
  inflammatory or abusive language.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></i></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><i><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">-
  any article which fails to do constructive criticism on religion, instead
  engages in ‘bashing’, will not be posted.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></i></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><i><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">-
  All kinds of human rights violations, including minority issues, women issues,
  and imperialist attacks on another country by more powerful nations or recent
  international and BD issues will get greater visibility. <o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></i></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><i><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">-
  Editors will preserve the ultimate right to reject or approve any articles.<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></i></p>
  <p style="line-height:14.4pt"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="color: black">I
  am hoping to formalize a set of guidelines very soon. I’ll share them with
  all of you once I get them all together. <o:p>
