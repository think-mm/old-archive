	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Response: </b>
	Yes but you started your debate with Buddhist philosophy to counter the 
	argument from Quantum fluctuation.&nbsp; Let me remind you again before our main 
	issue of discussion is being distracted:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>You said 
		-&quot;Buddhist principle</b> that nothing exists without a cause is 
		universally applicable, right from the beginning of the universe. There 
		is no exception to this rule (message # 20927).&quot; &nbsp;I&nbsp; explained to you 
		Quantum phenomenon, such as atomic transitions and radioactive decay of 
		nuclei, seem to happen without prior cause. Physicst Like Vic Stenger, 
		Brent Meeker, Aparthib also shared the same view.</font></li>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You committed&nbsp; 
		a <b>fallacy of &quot;Appeal to authority&quot;</b>, while mentioning the name of 
		Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Gary Zukav, Fritzof capra, Jeremy Hayward etc. 
		to prove your absolute devotion in Buddist philosophy.&nbsp; I pointed out 
		that&nbsp; this line of argument is absolutely wrong. One can siilarly quote 
		many distinguished scholars (some are famous scientists) for you who are 
		sympathetic towards Islam or Muhammad. That does not prove Islam is true 
		either. (message # 20999)</font></li>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You claimed 
		Buddhists were ahead of modern scientists by almost 1100 years, however 
		you did not answer why they failed to invent Tunnelling Microscopy until 
		the western scientist came out successfully using the principle of 
		quantum mechanics, neither you could give any references from scientific 
		journals how Buddhist philosophers solved the theory of&nbsp; noncommuting 
		operators, or Hamilton-Jaccobi equation of motion to infer wave 
		equation.</font> </li>
		<li>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You claimed as 
		per Buddisht Philosophy&nbsp; that electrons do not spin. However I provided 
		references (citing two types of experimental evidences)&nbsp; that arose in 
		the 1920s to&nbsp; suggest clearly this spin property of the electron. One 
		was the&nbsp; experiment of Otto Stern and Walter Gerlach, another one was 
		fine structure of the hydrogen spectral lines.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All the facts 
	pointed above leads to the conclusion that Buddhist philosophy has not been 
	updated for quite long or in other words it does not fit for 20th century, 
	if everything not wrong at all.</font></p>

				<span style="font-family: Arial">...&nbsp; Avijit, I had

				Logic, Vol. 1. The paragraph is attributed to Vasubandhu (4th 
				century AD): By the way Buddhist Logic was written in 1930 by F. 
				Th. Stcherbatsky. It was translated into English in 1962. 
				Hundreds of papers on Buddhist Logic have been published by

				<span style="font-family: Arial">Now tell me Avijit, which

	</div>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Response: </b>No; not really. Let 
	me tell you in detail how Max Plank's theory accepted in the scientific 
	community and what is the basic differences it hold in comparison to ancient 
	Buddhist philosophy. The quantum theory was launched in the first year of 
	the twentieth century with Max Plank's explanation of the anomalous 
	radiative behavior of light. In order to account the spectrum of light 
	radiated from the hot body, Plank introduced the idea that light occurs in a 
	discrete blasts, called quanta, whose energies are proportional to the 
	frequencies of the light. The idea was utilized later by Einstein in 1905 
	(the same year he published the theory of relativity), to explain the 
	photoelectric effect. Einstein proposed that light was composed of 
	particles, later dubbed as <i>photons</i>, and the energy E of a photon was 
	related to the frequency of the light n, by Planks formula, E = h*n; where h 
	is planks constant. So there should be proper mathematical derivation to 
	accept your theory in scientific community (which was absent in Buddist 
	philosophy) as well as need some experimental evidences. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For example, in Einstien's model, it 
	has been experimentally shown that the photoelectric effect results when an 
	incoming photon sufficiently high energy strikes a single electron, knocking 
	it out of the metal. Higher frequency light, such as ultra-violet light 
	contains higher energy photons so may be able to produce a current where 
	visible light cannot. Those are all experimentally verified by the western 
	scientists. No ancient Buddhist philosopher carried out such experiments to 
	prove their theoretical derivation at their time. so relating &quot;other flames 
	have appeared in other contiguous places.&quot; with quanta or photon and 
	claiming that Vasubandhu's idea similar to Max Planks, is just a mere 
	hypocrisy. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Also know that scientist Bhor did 
	not believe in photon first while constructing his atom model, and offering 
	a rather more complicated explanation. However, soon he came to realize that 
	photons emitted or absorbed during transitions between energy levels in an 
	atom, provided a practical description of radiation process. It is Bohr who 
	applied quantum theory (called the principle of quantized action) by which 
	Bohr was able to calculate the discrete frequencies of light observed to be 
	emitted by the Hydrogen atom. All happened in a gradual process which is 
	called scientific advancement. Claiming that ancient Buddhist philosopher 
	knew all those modern theories without providing any substantial evidences 
	of mathematical formulation and realistic experimentation, leads us to a 
	bizarre extreme.</font></p>

				<p align="justify"><font color="#008000">
				<span style="font-family: Arial">...&nbsp; Einstein was looking

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Response: </b>It is important to 
	realize we do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way 
	that theists view their religious leaders. Also, note that even famous 
	scientists' views are treated with skepticism by the scientific community, 
	no matter whether it is Einstein, Hawking or Newton. Acknowledged experts in 
	a particular field must still provide evidence for their theories; science 
	relies on reproducible, independently confirmed results. New theories which 
	are incompatible with a large body of existing scientific knowledge will be 
	subject to especially close scrutiny; but if the work is sound and the 
	experimental data reproducible, the new theories will displace the old. For 
	instance, both special relativity and quantum mechanics were highly 
	controversial, and required that a lot of existing scientific theory be 
	thrown out. Yet both were relatively quickly accepted after extensive 
	experiments proved their correctness. Pseudo-scientific theories such as 
	creationism are rejected not because they are controversial, but because 
	they simply do not stand up to basic scientific scrutiny. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Albert Einstein was very interested 
	in this question of QM, and it was the issue of randomness implicit in 
	quantum mechanics that kept him from ever accepting quantum mechanics, he is 
	quoted as saying, “God does not play dice.” But this one statement is not 
	enough to prove Quantum mechanics is wrong, unless and until one can come 
	out with a definite mathematical proof, and surely Einstein could not during 
	his life time. At one physics conference Einstein spouted such God aphorisms 
	and one of his colleagues shot back, “Stop telling God what to do!” So many 
	years have been passed, we are yet to see any scientist came with any 
	mathematical proof to prove QM wrong, even though some of them may feel 
	uncomfortable because of it's counter-intuitive nature. We now are certain 
	that any new physics that is discovered in the years to come will have to be 
	consistent with quantum mechanics, so the randomness seems to be here to 
	stay, no matter what Ksanika philosophy says. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">You said, &quot;Ksanika philosophy also 
	does not believe in probability....&quot;, that's why it is no science, its just 
	an ancient belief. The association of probability (Statistical postulate) 
	was not as bizarre as it may seem. In fact the role of statistics in quantum 
	mechanics was supported by Einstein's own calculation of the probabilities 
	for atomic transitions, even though he could not accept it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Don't think Einstein was right in 
	every aspect. In his colorful life Einstein got many things wrong, not only 
	once or twice, but countless times. For example, In 1911, Einstein predicted 
	how much sun's gravity would deflect nearby starlight and got it wrong by 
	half. He rigged the equations of general relativity to explain why the 
	cosmos stand still, while it was actually not (Later he confessed it as his 
	greatest blunder). Also beginning of mid 1920s, he churned out faulty 
	unified field theories at t prodigious rate. The examples are many. He was 
	wrong about the universe, wrong about his contents, wrong about his working 
	of atoms. Yet, Einstein's mistakes could be compelling and instructive, and 
	of course some of them were even essential to the progress of modern 
	physics. Science itself is a self-correcting process, and it does not have 
	any &quot;philosophical or religious guru&quot;. So vaguely quoting Einstein would not 
	prove anything in favor of Ksanika philosophy.</font></p>
