  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">A handful of academics with
  church leaning had attacked Darwin’s theory of evolution claiming that a
  complicated structure such as bacterium’s flagella (spinning tail) cannot
  evolve.&nbsp; Similarly, human eyes with its complex and specialized cells and
  tissue including lens cannot evolve naturally.&nbsp; In other words, these
  things have evolved because of the divine intervention.&nbsp; Their pet theory
  is called “</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FF0000">Intelligent
  Design</font><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">.”&nbsp; These charlatan academics and their
  naïve partners—church authorities—have been in a slugfest over the issue
  of Darwinian evolution.&nbsp; They realize that with the recent development of
  genomics study, more and more supports are coming out in with an accelerated
  pace in favor of Darwinian theory of evolution.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">To combat the intrusion of
  scientific theory of evolution in the classroom, these challengers of
  Darwinism have come up with a dozen or so questions.&nbsp; They frequently
  pose these questions only to confuse a layman and other persons who are not
  trained in the field.&nbsp; The ordinary human beings have great difficulty
  grasping Darwin’s theory of ‘Natural Selection.’&nbsp; Also, the great
  length of time—sometimes millions of years—that is required for the
  evolution of more complex organisms is not helping the cause of understanding
  the scientific theory of evolution by laymen.&nbsp; Thus, the Church and
  Muslim clergies are giving a simplified version of “Creationism” as an
  alternative theory of evolution.&nbsp; However, in the West, the school
  authorities are not buying the Churches' teachings.&nbsp; Therefore, the
  cunning Church authorities have formed an alliance with some academics in the
  US to come up with an alternative theory of evolution.&nbsp; They are calling
  this theory an “Intelligent Design.”</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">The basic premise of the
  “Intelligent Design” theory of evolution is that natural selection cannot
  or will not come up with a complex structure such as bacterial flagella, heart
  muscle, eye, etc., therefore, an intelligent designer has to make these
  things.&nbsp; This fits very well with the dogma of Churches and other
  monotheistic religion.&nbsp; In Hinduism also, there is this powerful Brahma
  whose job is to make living and non-living things.&nbsp; This simplistic
  notion could satisfy very easily many people who will have hard time grasping
  the complexity of Darwin’s scientific theory of evolution.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">A case in point is the
  complexities of protein structure.&nbsp; Although proteins are known to exist
  in organism over hundred years or so, but theirs three-dimensional structure
  is only known for the last 50 years or so.&nbsp; These are linear chains of
  amino acids, but they fold in a unique way to give the active structure.&nbsp;
  Protein chemists say that the pattern of folding is inherent in the sequence.&nbsp;
  If a protein misfolds, then it won’t work.&nbsp; Many mutations in
  hemoglobin, which is a blood protein, will lead to deformed protein because
  their structures are not going to be far from being ideal.&nbsp; How would the
  proponent of an “Intelligent Design” theory explain the anomalies in
  protein structure?&nbsp; The naturalist would say that mutation is a normal
  phenomenon for producing variabilities, which is the lifeblood of evolution.&nbsp;
  Had there been no mutation, a cyanobacteria or any primitive single-celled
  organism would be the only living things present in our world. It would take
  eons for 'Intelligent Designer' (read God) to come up with the designs of tens
  and thousands of proteins that make up a single human cells.&nbsp; The Mother
  nature came up with these proteins by trials and errors over millions of
  years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">The proponents of the
  ‘Intelligent Design’ theory take example readily from an old fashion
  watch, which is precision engineered manmade thing.&nbsp; They opine that man
  could have only evolved from an “Intelligent Design” done by you know who
  that is.&nbsp; In nature spontaneous or self-assembly could take place and
  result in very complex structure.&nbsp; I have viewed many of those structures
  that scientists have elucidated in recent times.&nbsp; The awesome beauty of
  protein molecules as rendered by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy can
  easily seen in a computer screen by visiting the Cn3D page of National Center
  for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3D.shtm">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.shtml</a>.&nbsp;
  One first has to download the free visualization software Cn3D.&nbsp; For a
  starter one could write hemoglobin as the molecule in the query line.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">Recently, I found the writings
  of John Rennie, the editor in-chief of Scientific American on the issue of
  misleading propaganda by the proponent of “Intelligent Design” theory.&nbsp;
  Mr. Rennie took the onus on him to rebut 15 common questions that are being
  raised by the proponent of “Intelligent Design” theorists.&nbsp; I would
  request any readers who are interested in this subject to go through Mr.
  Rennie’s article, which I am posting down below.&nbsp; The editor in-chief
  of Scientific American has done a wonderful job of explaining how wrong those
  academic charlatans are to create confusion among rational people.&nbsp; They
  desperately wanted to include in the high school textbooks some flawed ideas
  about evolution, which have no scientific merits at all.&nbsp; With this, I
  rest my case.</font><br>

  of evolution want to make a place for creationism by tearing down real
  science, but their arguments <u>don't hold up</u>.&quot;</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">When Charles Darwin introduced
  the theory of evolution 143 years ago, the scientists of the day argued over
  it fiercely, but the massing evidence from paleontology, genetics, zoology,
  molecular biology and other fields gradually established evolution's truth
  beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Today that battle has been won
  everywhere-except in the public imagination.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Embarrassingly, in the 21st
  century, in the most scientifically advanced nation the world has ever known,
  creationists can still persuade politicians, judges and ordinary citizens that
  evolution is a flawed, poorly supported fantasy. They lobby for creationist
  ideas such as &quot;intelligent design&quot; to be taught as alternatives to
  evolution in science classrooms.&nbsp; As this article goes to press, the Ohio
  Board of Education is debating whether to mandate such a change.&nbsp; Some
  antievolutionists, such as Philip E. Johnson, a law professor at the
  University of California at Berkeley and author of <i>Darwin on Trial</i>,
  admit that they intend for intelligent-design theory to</font><br>
  <font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#333333">serve as a </font><font color="#cc0000">&quot;wedge&quot;</font><font color="#333333">
  for reopening science classrooms to discussions of God.</font></font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Besieged teachers and others may
  increasingly find themselves on the spot to defend evolution and refute
  creationism.&nbsp; The arguments that creationists use are typically specious
  and based on misunderstandings of (or outright lies about) evolution, but the
  number and diversity of the objections can put even well-informed people at a
  disadvantage.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#333333">To help with answering

  &nbsp;<b><font color="#000099">NAUTILIUS SHELL: Designed or Evolved?</font></b></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">1. Evolution is only a
  theory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a fact or a scientific law.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Many people learned in
  elementary school that a theory falls in the middle of a hierarchy of
  certainty—above a mere hypothesis but below a law.&nbsp; Scientists do not
  use the terms that way, however.&nbsp; According to the National Academy of
  Sciences (NAS), a scientific theory is &quot;a well-substantiated explanation
  of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws,
  inferences, and tested hypotheses.&quot;&nbsp; No amount of validation changes
  a theory into a law, which is a descriptive generalization about nature.&nbsp;
  So when scientists talk about the theory of evolution—or the atomic theory
  or the theory of relativity, for that matter—they are not expressing
  reservations about its truth.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">In addition to the theory of
  evolution, meaning the idea of descent with modification, one may also speak
  of the fact of evolution.&nbsp; The NAS defines a fact as &quot;an observation
  that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted
  as 'true'.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fossil record and abundant other evidence
  testify that organisms have evolved through time.&nbsp; Although no one
  observed those transformations, the indirect evidence is clear, unambiguous
  and compelling.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">All sciences frequently rely on
  indirect evidence.&nbsp; Physicists cannot see subatomic particles directly,
  for instance, so they verify their existence by watching for telltale tracks
  that the particles leave in cloud chambers.&nbsp; The absence of direct
  observation does not make physicists' conclusions less certain.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">2. Natural selection
  is based on circular reasoning: the fittest are those who survive, and those
  who survive are deemed fittest.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">&quot;Survival of the
  fittest&quot; is a conversational way to describe natural selection, but a
  more technical description speaks of differential rates of survival and
  reproduction.&nbsp; That is, rather than labeling species as more or less fit,
  one can describe how many offspring they are likely to leave under given
  circumstances.&nbsp; Drop a fast-breeding pair of small-beaked finches and a
  slower-breeding pair of large-beaked finches onto an island full of food
  seeds.&nbsp; Within a few generations the fast breeders may control more of
  the food resources.&nbsp; Yet if large beaks more easily crush seeds, the
  advantage may tip to the slow breeders.&nbsp; In a pioneering study of finches
  on the Galapagos Islands, Peter R. Grant of Princeton University observed
  these kinds of population shifts in the wild [see his article &quot;Natural
  Selection and Darwin's Finches&quot;; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, October 1991].</font>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="fig_two.JPG" width="524" height="93"></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">The key is that adaptive fitness
  can be defined without reference to survival: large beaks are better adapted
  for crushing seeds, irrespective of whether that trait has survival value
  under the circumstances.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">3. Evolution is
  unscientific, because it is not testable or falsifiable.&nbsp; It makes claims
  about events that were not observed and can never be re-created.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">This blanket dismissal of
  evolution ignores important distinctions that divide the field into at least
  two broad areas: microevolution and macroevolution.&nbsp; Microevolution looks
  at changes within species over time—changes that may be preludes to
  speciation, the origin of new species.&nbsp; Macroevolution studies how
  taxonomic groups above the level of species change.&nbsp; Its evidence draws
  frequently from the fossil record and DNA comparisons to reconstruct how
  various organisms may be related.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">These days even most
  creationists acknowledge that microevolution has been upheld by tests in the
  laboratory (as in studies of cells, plants and fruit flies) and in the field
  (as in Grant's studies of evolving beak shapes among Galapagos finches).&nbsp;
  Natural selection and other mechanisms—such as chromosomal changes,
  symbiosis and hybridization—can drive profound changes in populations over
  time.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">The historical nature of
  macroevolutionary study involves inference from fossils and DNA rather than
  direct observation.&nbsp; Yet in the historical sciences (which include
  astronomy, geology and archaeology, as well as evolutionary biology),
  hypotheses can still be tested by checking whether they accord with physical
  evidence and whether they lead to verifiable predictions about future
  discoveries.&nbsp; For instance, evolution implies that between the
  earliest-known ancestors of humans (roughly five million years old) and the
  appearance of anatomically modern humans (about 100,000 years ago), one should
  find a succession of hominid creatures with features progressively less
  apelike and more modern, which is indeed what the fossil record shows.&nbsp;
  But one should not — and does not — find modern human fossils embedded in
  strata from the Jurassic period (65 million years ago).&nbsp; Evolutionary
  biology routinely makes predictions far more refined and precise than this,
  and researchers test them constantly.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#333333">Evolution could be
  disproved in other ways, too.&nbsp; If we could document the spontaneous
  generation of just one complex life-form from inanimate matter, then at least
  a few creatures seen in the fossil record might have originated this way.&nbsp;
  </font><font color="#009900">If superintelligent aliens appeared and claimed
  credit for creating life on earth (or even particular species), the purely
  evolutionary explanation would be cast in doubt.&nbsp; But no one has yet
  produced such evidence.</font></font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">It should be noted that the idea
  of falsifiability as the defining characteristic of science originated with
  philosopher Karl Popper in the 1930s.&nbsp; More recent elaborations on his
  thinking have expanded the narrowest interpretation of his principle precisely
  because it would eliminate too many branches of clearly scientific endeavor.</font>

  SKULLS of some hominids predating humans (Homo sapiens)</font></b>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">4. Increasingly,
  scientists doubt the truth of evolution.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">No evidence suggests that
  evolution is losing adherents.&nbsp; </font><font color="#333333">Pick up any
  issue of a peer-reviewed biological journal, and you will find articles that
  support and extend evolutionary studies or that embrace evolution as a
  fundamental concept.</font></font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#333333">Conversely, serious
  scientific publications disputing evolution are all but nonexistent.&nbsp; In
  the mid-1990s George W. Gilchrist of the University of Washington surveyed
  thousands of journals in the primary literature, seeking articles on </font><font color="#663366">intelligent
  design</font><font color="#333333"> or </font><font color="#663366">creation
  science</font><font color="#333333">.&nbsp; Among those hundreds of thousands
  of scientific reports, he found none.&nbsp; In the past two years, surveys
  done independently by Barbara Forrest of Southeastern Louisiana University and
  Lawrence M. Krauss of Case Western Reserve University have been similarly
  fruitless.</font></font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Creationists retort that a
  closed-minded scientific community rejects their evidence.&nbsp; Yet according
  to the editors of Nature, Science and other leading journals, few
  antievolution manuscripts are even submitted.&nbsp; Some antievolution authors
  have published papers in serious journals.&nbsp; Those papers, however, rarely
  attack evolution directly or advance creationist arguments; at best, they
  identify certain evolutionary problems as unsolved and difficult (which no one
  disputes).&nbsp; In short, creationists are not giving the scientific world
  good reason to take them seriously.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">5. The disagreements
  among even evolutionary biologists show how little solid science supports
  evolution.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Evolutionary biologists
  passionately debate diverse topics: how speciation happens, the rates of
  evolutionary change, the ancestral relationships of birds and dinosaurs,
  whether Neandertals were a species apart from modern humans, and much more.&nbsp;
  These disputes are like those found in all other branches of science.&nbsp;
  Acceptance of evolution as a factual occurrence and a guiding principle is
  nonetheless universal in biology.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Unfortunately, dishonest
  creationists have shown a willingness to take scientists' comments out of
  context to exaggerate and distort the disagreements.&nbsp; Anyone acquainted
  with the works of paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard University knows
  that in addition to co-authoring the punctuated-equilibrium model, Gould was
  one of the most eloquent defenders and articulators of evolution. (Punctuated
  equilibrium explains patterns in the fossil record by suggesting that most
  evolutionary changes occur within geologically brief intervals—which may
  nonetheless amount to hundreds of generations.)&nbsp; Yet creationists delight
  in dissecting out phrases from Gould's voluminous prose to make him sound as
  though he had doubted evolution, and they present punctuated equilibrium as
  though it allows new species to materialize overnight or birds to be born from
  reptile eggs.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">When confronted with a quotation
  from a scientific authority that seems to question evolution, insist on seeing
  the statement in context.&nbsp; Almost invariably, the attack on evolution
  will prove illusory.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">6. If humans descended
  from monkegs, why are there still monkegs?</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">This surprisingly common
  argument reflects several levels of ignorance about evolution.&nbsp; The first
  mistake is that evolution does not teach that humans descended from monkeys;
  it states that both have a common ancestor.&nbsp; The deeper error is that
  this objection is tantamount to asking, &quot;If children descended from
  adults, why are there still adults?&quot;&nbsp; New species evolve by
  splintering off from established ones, when populations of organisms become
  isolated from the main branch of their family and acquire sufficient
  differences to remain forever distinct.&nbsp; The parent species may survive
  indefinitely thereafter, or it may become extinct.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">7. Evolution cannot
  explain how life first appeared on earth.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">The origin of life remains very
  much a mystery, but biochemists have learned about how primitive nucleic
  acids, amino acids and other building blocks of life could have formed and
  organized themselves into self-replicating, self-sustaining units, laying the
  foundation for cellular biochemistry.&nbsp; Astrochemical analyses hint that
  quantities of these compounds might have originated in space and fallen to
  earth in comets, a scenario that may solve the problem of how those
  constituents arose under the conditions that prevailed when our planet was
  young.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Creationists sometimes try to
  invalidate all of evolution by pointing to science's current inability to
  explain the origin of life.&nbsp; But even if life on earth turned out to have
  a nonevolutionary origin (for instance, if aliens introduced the first cells
  billions of years ago), evolution since then would be robustly confirmed by
  countless microevolutionary and macroevolutionary studies.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">8. Mathematically, it
  is inconceivable that anything as complex as a protein, let alone a living
  cell or a human, could spring up by chance.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Chance plays a part in evolution
  (for example, in the random mutations that can give rise to new traits), but
  evolution does not depend on chance to create organisms, proteins or other
  entities.&nbsp; Quite the opposite: natural selection, the principal known
  mechanism of evolution, harnesses nonrandom change by preserving
  &quot;desirable&quot; (adaptive) features and eliminating
  &quot;undesirable&quot; (non-adaptive) ones.&nbsp; As long as the forces of
  selection stay constant, natural selection can push evolution in one direction
  and produce sophisticated structures in surprisingly short times.</font>

  <p><center></center><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">As an analogy,
  consider the 13-letter sequence &quot;TOBEORNOTTOBE.&quot;&nbsp; Those
  hypothetical million monkeys, each pecking out one phrase a second, could take
  as long as 78,800 years to find it among the 2613 sequences of that length.&nbsp;
  But in the 1980s Richard Hardison of Glendale College wrote a computer program
  that generated phrases randomly while preserving the positions of individual
  letters that happened to be correctly placed (in effect, selecting for phrases
  more like Hamlet's).&nbsp; On average, the program re-created the phrase in
  just 336 iterations, less than 90 seconds.&nbsp; Even more amazing, it could
  reconstruct Shakespeare's entire play in just four and a half days.</font><br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">9. The Second Law of
  Thermodynamics says that systems must become more disordered overtime.&nbsp;
  Living cells therefore could not have evolved from inanimate chemicals, and
  multicellular life could not have evolved from protozoa.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">This argument derives from a
  misunderstanding of the Second Law.&nbsp; If it were valid, mineral crystals
  and snow-flakes would also be impossible, because they, too, are complex
  structures that form spontaneously from disordered parts.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">The Second Law actually states
  that the total entropy of a closed system (one that no energy or matter leaves
  or enters) cannot decrease.&nbsp; Entropy is a physical concept often casually
  described as disorder, but it differs significantly from the conversational
  use of the word.&nbsp; More important, however, the Second Law permits parts
  of a system to decrease in entropy as long as other parts experience an
  offsetting increase.&nbsp; Thus, our planet as a whole can grow more complex
  because the sun pours heat and light onto it, and the greater entropy
  associated with the sun's nuclear fusion more than rebalances the scales.&nbsp;
  Simple organisms can fuel their rise toward complexity by consuming other
  forms of life and nonliving materials.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">10. Mutations are
  essential to evolution theory, but mutations can only eliminate traits.&nbsp;
  They cannot produce new features.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">On the contrary, biology has
  catalogued many traits produced by point mutations (changes at precise
  positions in an organism's DNA) — bacterial resistance to antibiotics, for
  example.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Mutations that arise in the
  homeobox (<i>Hox</i>) family of development-regulating genes in animals can
  also have complex effects.&nbsp; <i>Hox</i> genes direct where legs, wings,
  antennae and body segments should grow.&nbsp; In fruit flies, for instance,
  the mutation called <i>Antennapedia </i>causes legs to sprout where antennae
  should grow.&nbsp; These abnormal limbs are not functional, but their
  existence demonstrates that genetic mistakes can produce complex structures,
  which natural selection can then test for possible uses.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Moreover, molecular biology has
  discovered mechanisms for genetic change that go beyond point mutations, and
  these expand the ways in which new traits can appear.&nbsp; Functional modules
  within genes can be spliced together in novel ways.&nbsp; Whole genes can be
  accidentally duplicated in an organism's DNA, and the duplicates are free to
  mutate into genes for new, complex features.&nbsp; Comparisons of the DNA from
  a wide variety of organisms indicate that this is how the globin family of
  blood proteins evolved over millions of years.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">11. Natural selection
  might explain microevolution, but it cannot explain the origin of new species
  and higher orders of life.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Evolutionary biologists have
  written extensively about how natural selection could produce new species.&nbsp;
  For instance, in the model called allopatry, developed by Ernst Mayr of
  Harvard University, if a population of organisms were isolated from the rest
  of its species by geographical boundaries, it might be subjected to different
  selective pressures.&nbsp; Changes would accumulate in the isolated
  population.&nbsp; If those changes became so significant that the splinter
  group could not or routinely would not breed with the original stock, then the
  splinter group would be reproductively isolated and on its way toward becoming
  a new species.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Natural selection is the best
  studied of the evolutionary mechanisms, but biologists are open to other
  possibilities as well.&nbsp; Biologists are constantly assessing the potential
  of unusual genetic mechanisms for causing speciation or for producing complex
  features in organisms.&nbsp; Lynn Margulis of the University of Massachusetts
  at Amherst and others have persuasively argued that some cellular organelles,
  such as the energy-generating mitochondria, evolved through the symbiotic
  merger of ancient organisms.&nbsp; Thus, science welcomes the possibility of
  evolution resulting from forces beyond natural selection. Yet those forces
  must be natural; they cannot be attributed to the actions of mysterious
  creative intelligences whose existence, in scientific terms, is unproved.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">12. Nobody has
  overseen a new species evolve.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Speciation is probably fairly
  rare and in many cases might take centuries.&nbsp; Furthermore, recognizing a
  new species during a formative stage can be difficult, because biologists
  sometimes disagree about how best to define a species.&nbsp; The most widely
  used definition, Mayr's Biological Species Concept, recognizes a species as a
  distinct community of reproductively isolated populations—sets of organisms
  that normally do not or cannot breed outside their community.&nbsp; In
  practice, this standard can be difficult to apply to organisms isolated by
  distance or terrain or to plants (and, of course, fossils do not breed).&nbsp;
  Biologists therefore usually use organisms' physical and behavioral traits as
  clues to their species membership.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Nevertheless, the scientific
  literature does contain reports of apparent speciation events in plants,
  insects and worms.&nbsp; In most of these experiments, researchers subjected
  organisms to various types of selection—for anatomical differences, mating
  behaviors, habitat preferences and other traits—and found that they had
  created populations of organisms that did not breed with outsiders.&nbsp; For
  example, William R. Rice of the University of New Mexico and George W. Salt of
  the University of California at Davis demonstrated that if they sorted a group
  of fruit flies by their preference for certain environments and bred those
  flies separately over 35 generations, the resulting flies would refuse to
  breed with those from a very different environment.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">13. Evolutionists
  cannot point to any transitional fossils—creatures that are half reptile and
  half bird, for instance.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Actually, paleontologists know
  of many detailed examples of fossils intermediate inform between various
  taxonomic groups.&nbsp; One of the most famous fossils of all time is <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
  which combines feathers and skeletal structures peculiar to birds with
  features of dinosaurs.&nbsp; A flock's worth of other feathered fossil
  species, some more avian and some less, has also been found.&nbsp; A sequence
  of fossils spans the evolution of modern horses from the tiny <i>Eohippus</i>.&nbsp;
  Whales had four-legged ancestors that walked on land, and creatures known as <i>Ambulocetus</i>
  and <i>Rodhocetus</i> helped to make that transition [see &quot;The Mammals
  That Conquered the Seas,&quot; by Kate Wong; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, May].&nbsp;
  Fossil seashells trace the evolution of various mollusks through millions of
  years.&nbsp; Perhaps 20 or more hominids (not all of them our ancestors) fill
  the gap between Lucy the australopithecine and modern humans.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Creationists, though, dismiss
  these fossil studies.&nbsp; They argue that <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is not a
  missing link between reptiles and birds—it is just an extinct bird with
  reptilian features.&nbsp; They want evolutionists to produce a weird, chimeric
  monster that cannot be classified as belonging to any known group.&nbsp; Even
  if a creationist does accept a fossil as transitional between two species, he
  or she may then insist on seeing other fossils intermediate between it and the
  first two.&nbsp; These frustrating requests can proceed ad infinitum and place
  an unreasonable burden on the always incomplete fossil record.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#009900">Nevertheless,
  evolutionists can cite further supportive evidence from molecular biology.&nbsp;
  All organisms share most of the same genes, but as evolution predicts, the
  structures of these genes and their products diverge among species, in keeping
  with their evolutionary relationships.&nbsp; Geneticists speak of the </font><font color="#990000">&quot;molecular
  clock&quot;</font><font color="#009900"> that records the passage of time.&nbsp;
  These molecular data also show how various organisms are transitional within
  evolution.</font></font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">14. Living things have
  fantastically intricate features—at the anatomical, cellular and molecular
  levels—that could not function if they were any less complex or
  sophisticated.&nbsp; The only prudent conclusion is that they are the products
  of intelligent design, not evolution.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">This &quot;argument from
  design&quot; is the backbone of most recent attacks on evolution, but it is
  also one of the oldest.&nbsp; In 1802, theologian William Paley wrote that if
  one finds a pocket watch in a field, the most reasonable conclusion is that
  someone dropped it, not that natural forces created it there.&nbsp; By
  analogy, Paley argued, the complex structures of living things must be the
  handiwork of direct, divine invention.&nbsp; Darwin wrote <i>On the Origin of
  Species</i> as an answer to Paley: he explained how natural forces of
  selection, acting on inherited features, could gradually shape the evolution
  of ornate organic structures.</font>

  evolution and species divergence</font></center></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#333333">Generations of
  creationists have tried to counter Darwin by citing the example of the eye as
  a structure that could not have evolved. The eye's ability to provide vision
  depends on the perfect arrangement of its parts, these critics say.&nbsp;
  Natural selection could thus never favor the transitional forms needed during
  the eye's evolution—what good is half an eye?&nbsp; Anticipating this
  criticism, Darwin suggested that even &quot;incomplete&quot; eyes might confer
  benefits (such as helping creatures orient toward light) and thereby survive
  for further evolutionary refinement.&nbsp; </font><font color="#009900">Biology
  has vindicated Darwin: researchers have identified primitive eyes and
  light-sensing organs throughout the animal kingdom and have even tracked the
  evolutionary history of eyes through comparative genetics.&nbsp; (It now
  appears that in various families of organisms, eyes have evolyed
  independently.)</font></font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Today's intelligent-design
  advocates are more sophisticated than their predecessors, but their arguments
  and goals are not fundamentally different.&nbsp; They criticize evolution by
  trying to demonstrate that it could not account for life as we know it and
  then insist that the only tenable alternative is that life was designed by an
  unidentified intelligence.</font><br>
  &nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#993366" size="+1">15. Recent discoveries
  prove that even at the microscopic level, life has a quality of complexity
  that could not have come about through evolution.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">&quot;Irreducible
  complexity&quot; is the battle cry of Michael J. Behe of Lehigh University,
  author of <i>Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution</i>.&nbsp;
  As a household example of irreducible complexity, Behe chooses the
  mousetrap—a machine that could not function if any of its pieces were
  missing and whose pieces have no value except as parts of the whole.&nbsp;
  What is true of the mousetrap, he says, is even truer of the bacterial
  flagellum, a whiplike cellular organelle used for propulsion that operates
  like an outboard motor.&nbsp; The proteins that make up a flagellum are
  uncannily arranged into motor components, a universal joint and other
  structures like those that a human engineer might specify.&nbsp; The
  possibility that this intricate array could have arisen through evolutionary
  modification is virtually nil, Behe argues, and that bespeaks intelligent
  design.&nbsp; He makes similar points about the blood's clotting mechanism and
  other molecular systems.</font>
  <p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="fig_six.JPG" width="520" height="481"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Yet evolutionary biologists have
  answers to these objections.&nbsp; First, there exist flagellae with forms
  simpler than the one that Behe cites, so it is not necessary for all those
  components to be present for a flagellum to work.&nbsp; The sophisticated
  components of this flagellum all have precedents elsewhere in nature, as
  described by Kenneth R. Miller of Brown University and others.&nbsp;&nbsp; In
  fact, the entire flagellum assembly is extremely similar to an organelle that <i>Yersinia
  pestis</i>, the bubonic plague bacterium, uses to inject toxins into cells.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#333333">The key is that the
  flagellum's component structures, which Behe suggests have no value apart from
  their role in propulsion, can serve multiple functions that would have helped
  favor their evolution.&nbsp; The final evolution of the flagellum might then
  have involved only the novel recombination of sophisticated parts that
  initially evolved for other purposes.&nbsp; Similarly, the blood-clotting
  system seems to involve the modification and elaboration of proteins that were
  originally used in digestion, according to studies by Russell F. Doolittle of
  the University of California at San Diego.&nbsp; </font><font color="#006600">So
  some of the complexity that Behe calls proof of intelligent design is not
  irreducible at all.</font></font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#333333">Complexity of a different
  kind—&quot;specified complexity&quot;—is the cornerstone of the
  intelligent-design arguments of William A. Dembski of Baylor University in his
  books <i>The Design inference and No free Lunch</i>.&nbsp; Essentially his
  argument is that living things are complex in a way that undirected, random
  processes could never produce.&nbsp; </font><font color="#990000">The only
  logical conclusion, Dembski asserts, in an echo of Paley 200 years ago, is
  that some superhuman intelligence created and shaped life.</font><font color="#333333">&nbsp;
  Dembski's argument contains several holes.&nbsp; It is wrong to insinuate that
  the field of explanations consists only of random processes or designing
  intelligences.&nbsp; Researchers into nonlinear systems and cellular automata
  at the Santa Fe Institute and elsewhere have demonstrated that simple,
  undirected processes can yield extraordinarily complex patterns.&nbsp; Some of
  the complexity seen in organisms may therefore emerge through natural
  phenomena that we as yet barely understand.&nbsp; But that is far different
  from saying that the complexity could not have arisen naturally.</font></font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#33ccff" size="+1">In summary,</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#333333">&quot;Creation
  science&quot; is a </font><font color="#993300">contradiction</font><font color="#333333">
  in terms.&nbsp; A central tenet of modem science is methodological
  naturalism—it seeks to explain the universe purely in terms of observed or
  testable natural mechanisms.&nbsp; Thus, physics describes the atomic nucleus
  with specific concepts governing matter and energy, and it tests those
  descriptions experimentally.&nbsp; Physicists introduce new particles, such as
  quarks, to flesh out their theories only when data show that the previous
  descriptions cannot adequately explain observed phenomena.&nbsp; The new
  particles do not have arbitrary properties, moreover-their definitions are
  tightly constrained, because the new particles must fit within the existing
  framework of physics.</font></font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">In contrast, intelligent-design
  theorists invoke shadowy entities that conveniently have whatever
  unconstrained abilities are needed to solve the mystery at hand.&nbsp; Rather
  than expanding scientific inquiry, such answers shut it down.&nbsp; (How does
  one disprove the existence of omnipotent intelligences?)</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Intelligent design offers few
  answers.&nbsp; For instance, when and how did a designing intelligence
  intervene in life's history?&nbsp; By creating the first DNA?&nbsp; The first
  cell?&nbsp; The first human?&nbsp; Was every species designed, or just a few
  early ones?&nbsp; Proponents of intelligent-design theory frequently decline
  to be pinned down on these points.&nbsp; They do not even make real attempts
  to reconcile their disparate ideas about intelligent design.&nbsp; Instead,
  they pursue argument by exclusion—that is, they belittle evolutionary
  explanations as farfetched or incomplete and then imply that only design-based
  alternatives remain.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Logically, this is misleading:
  even if one naturalistic explanation is flawed, it does not mean that all are.&nbsp;
  Moreover, it does not make one intelligent-design theory more reasonable than
  another.&nbsp; Listeners are essentially left: to fill in the blanks for
  themselves, and some will undoubtedly do so by substituting their religious
  beliefs for scientific ideas.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#333333">Time and again, science has
  shown that methodological naturalism can push back ignorance, finding
  increasingly detailed and informative answers to mysteries that once seemed
  impenetrable: the nature of light, the causes of disease, how the brain works.&nbsp;
  Evolution is doing the same with the riddle of how the living world took
  shape.&nbsp; Creationism, by any name, adds nothing of intellectual value to
  the effort.</font><br>
