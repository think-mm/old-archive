        Dear Friends,
        <p>This is it. ONE DAY LEFT. There are many things I’d like to say.
        I’ve been on the road getting out the vote for 51 straight days so I
        haven’t had much time to write. So I’ve put together a bunch of
        notes to various groups all in this one letter. Please feel free to copy
        and send whatever portions are appropriate to your friends and family as
        you spend these last 24 hours trying to convince whomever you can to
        show up and vote for John Kerry.
        <p>Here are my final words…
        <p><strong>To Decent Conservatives and Recovering Republicans:</strong>
        <p>In your heart of hearts you know Bush is a miserable failure. From
        having no plan on what to do in Iraq once he conquered Baghdad to the
        380 missing tons of explosives that could be used to kill our brave
        young men and women, this guy doesn’t have a clue how to fight and win
        a war. You should see the mail I’ve been getting lately from our
        troops over there. They know how much the Iraqi people hate them. They
        are sitting ducks anytime they go out on the road. Many believe we are
        not that far away from a Tet-style offensive inside the Green Zone with
        hundreds of Americans and Brits killed.
        <p>Bush refused to go after and capture Osama bin Laden. He fought,
        every step of the way, the investigation into the 9/11 attacks. Who on
        earth would oppose such a thing? If 3,000 people died at your place of
        work and your boss said we don’t need to find out why or how it
        happened, he’d be thrown out on his ear. Bush’s behavior after this
        great tragedy alone is reason enough for his removal.
        <p>You already know that George W. Bush is the farthest thing from a
        conservative. He’s a reckless spender who has run up record-breaking
        deficits and the biggest debt in our history. He believes in having the
        government pry into everything from your library records to your
        bedroom. He has hit you with hidden taxes with his tax cuts for the
        rich.
        <p>I know many of you don’t like Bush, but are unsure of Kerry. Give
        the new guy a chance. He won’t raise your taxes (unless you are
        super-rich), he won’t take your hunting gun away, he won’t make you
        visit France. He risked his life for you many years ago. He’s asking
        for the chance to do it again. Scott McConnell at The American
        Conservative magazine has endorsed him. What more do you need?
        <p><strong>To My Friends on the Left:</strong>
        <p>Okay, Kerry isn’t everything you wished he would be. You’re
        right. He’s not you! Or me. But we’re not on the ballot – Kerry
        is. Yes, Kerry was wrong to vote for authorization for war in Iraq but
        he was in step with 70% of the American public who was being lied to by
        Bush &amp; Co. And once everyone learned the truth, the majority turned
        against the war. Kerry has had only one position on the war – he
        believed his president.
        <p>President Kerry had better bring the troops home right away. My
        prediction: Kerry’s roots are anti-war. He has seen the horrors of war
        and because of that he will avoid war unless it is absolutely necessary.
        Ask most vets. But don’t ask someone whose only horror was when he
        arrived too late for a kegger in Alabama.
        <p>There’s a reason Bush calls Kerry the Number One Liberal in the
        Senate – THAT’S BECAUSE HE IS THE NUMBER ONE LIBERAL IN THE SENATE!
        What more do you want? My friends, this is about as good as it gets when
        voting for the Democrat. We don’t have the #29 Liberal running or the
        #14 Liberal or even the #2 Liberal – we got #1! When has that ever
        happened?
        <p>Those of us who may be to the left of the #1 liberal Democrat should
        remember that this year conservative Democrats have had to make a far
        greater shift in their position to back Kerry than we have. We’re the
        ones always being asked to make the huge compromises and to always vote
        holding our noses. No nose holding this time. This #1 liberal is not the
        tweedledee to Bush’s tweedledum.
        <p>&nbsp;
        <p><strong>To Nader Voters:</strong></p>
        <p>See the above note.
        <p>Ralph’s own party, the Green Party, would not endorse his run this
        year. That’s because those of us who want to build a third party in
        this country know that the only way to do this is to build bridges with
        those who believe in the issues Nader believes in. But not one of those
        people will sacrifice the chance to remove George W. Bush from the White
        House on Tuesday. The choice here is clear: do we join with our friends,
        or do we piss on them?
        <p>After the debacle of 2000, the Democrats got smart and abandoned the
        conservative wing of their party. That’s why 8 of the 9 Democrats in
        the primaries this year were from the liberal wing. Ralph should take
        credit for that and declare victory. It’s so sad that he doesn’t
        realize the good he’s accomplished. But for reasons only known to him,
        he’s more angry at the Democrats than he is at Bush. He has lost his
        compass. I worry he has lost his mind. But he still gives a great
        speech!
        <p>And Lila Lipscomb, the mother from Flint who lost her son in Iraq,
        she still grieves -- as do the mothers of 1,120 others (not to mention
        the mothers of the 100,000 Iraqis who have died because of Bush’s
        war). That’s what this election is about. Not Ralph proving some
        point. Almost none of us on his 2000 advisory group are supporting him
        this year. His total lack of respect for his best friends should tell
        all of you something about what he really thinks of you, too.
        <p><strong>To the Non-Swing States:</strong>
        <p>Stop listening to how your vote doesn’t count in this election and
        that your state is already decided for Kerry or Bush. It is critical
        that you vote because we not only need to give Kerry the electoral win,
        but he needs to have a HUGE mandate with an ENORMOUS popular vote
        victory as well. It will be impossible for him to get anything done for
        four years if there is no clear mandate. We must not only defeat Bush,
        we must put a stake in the heart of the right-wing, neo-con movement. If
        you live in New York, California, Illinois, Texas, the Northeast or the
        Deep South, you need to vote and you need to bring ten people with you
        to the polls. If you live in a state where we have the chance to elect
        the Democrat to the Senate or the House, you need to vote. Turn off the
        TV. Quit listening to news media that has a vested interest in repeating
        to you over and over that your vote does not count. It does.
        <p>If you have friends or relatives who live in the 30-plus non-swing
        states, call them and remind them how important it is that Kerry gets a
        massive popular vote victory.
        <p><strong>To Non-Voters:</strong>
        <p>I understand why you stopped voting. Politicians suck. Nothing ever
        seems to change. You’re only one vote.
        <p>Yes, politicians suck. But so do car salesmen – and that hasn’t
        stopped you from buying a car. Politicians only respond to the threat of
        the angry mob also known as the voting public. If most people don’t
        vote, that’s good news for them ‘cause then they don’t have to
        answer to the majority.
        <p>Almost fifty percent of Americans don’t vote. That means you belong
        to the largest political party in America – the Non-Voting Party. That
        means you hold all the power to toss George W. Bush out of the Oval
        Office. How cool is that?
        <p>I believe that we are going to have the largest election turnout in
        our lifetime tomorrow. You don’t want to miss out on that. The lines
        at the polls are going to be long and raucous and fun. It is an historic
        election. You won’t want to say that you were the only one who
        wasn’t there. Promise me you’ll vote, just this one time.
        <p><strong>To All First-Time Voters:</strong>
        <p>Welcome to the longest running, uninterrupted democracy on earth! You
        own it. It’s yours.
        <p>A few words about how messy it’s going to be tomorrow. The lines
        are going to be long. Bring your iPods. Better yet, bring a friend or
        two. The election officials have no clue just how many millions are
        going to show up at the polls. This will be the largest turnout in our
        lifetime. They don’t have enough machines. They are going to have to
        send for more ballots.
        <p>And they are going to make it difficult for you to vote. The new law
        says if this is your first time voting you must bring ID with you that
        matches the address you are registered at.
        <p>If for some reason they can’t find your name on the voting rolls,
        you have the right to ask for a provisional ballot, which you can fill
        out and then sort things out later.
        <p>If you have any problems at the polling place, please call
        1-866-OUR-VOTE. The people there can tell you how to find the precinct
        where you should be voting, get you legal help if you are denied the
        right to vote, or answer any other questions you may have.
        <p>If you need any help figuring out the ballot, don’t be afraid to
        ask. If you screw up your ballot, you can ask for another one. In fact,
        the law allows you to screw up your ballot two times before you finally
        have to submit your final ballot! Be careful to vote on the line that
        says John F. Kerry/John Edwards. Don’t vote for more than one
        Presidential, Senate or House candidate or you ballot won’t be
        counted. If your polling place has a stub or a receipt from your ballot,
        make sure they give you one.
        <p>Thanks for joining us. Democracy is not a spectator sport. It only
        works when we all come off the bench and participate.
        <p><strong>To African Americans:</strong>
        <p>First of all, let’s just acknowledge what you already know: America
        is a country which still has a race problem, to put it nicely. Al Gore
        would be president today had thousands of African Americans not had
        their right to vote stolen from them in Florida in 2000.
        <p>Here is my commitment: I will do everything I can to make sure that
        that this will not happen again. And I’m not the only one making this
        pledge. Thousands of volunteer lawyers are flying to Florida to act as
        poll watchers and intervene should there be any attempts to deny anyone
        their right to vote. They will NOT be messing around.
        <p>For my part, I have organized an army of 1,200 professional and
        amateur filmmakers who will be armed with video cameras throughout the
        states of Florida and Ohio. At the first sign of criminality, we will
        dispatch a camera crew to where the vote fraud is taking place and
        record what is going on. We will put a big public spotlight on any
        wrongdoing by Republican officials in those two states. They will not
        get away with this as they did in 2000.
        <p>In Ohio, the Republicans are sending almost 2,000 paid “poll
        challengers” into the black precincts of Cleveland in an attempt to
        stop African Americans from voting. This action is beyond despicable. Do
        not let this stop you from voting. I, and thousand of others, will be
        there to fight for you and protect you.
        <p><strong>To George W.:</strong>
        <p>I know it’s gotta be rough for you right now. Hey, we’ve all been
        there. “You’re fired” are two horrible words when put together in
        that order. Bin Laden surfacing this weekend to remind the American
        people of your total and complete failure to capture him was a cruel
        trick or treat. But there he was. 3,000 people were killed and he’s
        laughing in your face. Why did you stop our Special Forces from going
        after him? Why did you forget about bin Laden on the DAY AFTER 9/11 and
        tell your terrorism czar to concentrate on Iraq instead?
        <p>There he was, OBL, all tan and rested and on videotape (hey, did you
        get the feeling that he had a bootleg of my movie? Are there DVD players
        in those caves in Afghanistan?)
        <p>Speaking of my movie – can I ask you a personal question before we
        part ways for good on Tuesday? Why did you and your friends fund SIX
        “documentaries” trashing me -- but only ONE film against Kerry?
        C’mon, he was the candidate, not me. What a waste of your time and
        resources! Sure, I know what your pollsters told you, that the film had
        convinced some people to vote you out. I just want you to know that that
        was not my original intent. Funny things happen at the movies. Hope you
        get to see a few at the multiplex in Waco. It’s a great way to relax.
        <p><strong>To John Kerry:</strong>
        <p>Thank you.
        <p>And don’t worry – none of us are going away after you are
        inaugurated. We’ll be there to hold your hand and keep you honest.
        Don’t let us down. We’re betting you won’t. So is the rest of the
        world.
        <p>That’s it. See you at the polls – and at the victory party
        tomorrow night.
        <p>Yours,
        <p>Michael Moore
