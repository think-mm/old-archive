	<div class="doc-layout-body">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our &quot;single-mother&quot; 
		land Bangladesh is yet to confirm who exactly fathered this nation, even 
		after a long 36 years later. Despite standing tall as a recognized, 
		legitimate nation and being a legitimate creation; our politicians, 
		their chauvinists and intellectual's have been arguing on this issue 
		with many illegitimate thoughts of their own, leaving trails of nascent 
		bloods of nation's leaders, heroic freedom fighters and of thousands of 
		innocent men, women and children those laid down their lives for our 
		cause, for our freedom. In serving all deserving respects and 
		gratefulness to those heroes, we could better restrain our emotion of 
		political philosophy and be kinder and gentler on this ceremonial issue 
		of recognizing our founding fathers instead of creating a never-ending 
		dilemma. Vengeance out of our even handed mentally not only led to the 
		distortions of nation's history of independence but also reflect our 
		cruelty to their deserving respects. Our &quot;showdowns&quot; of showing respects 
		(to whom?) every year, on Ekushey February, 25 March or 16 December have 
		become vaguely fake and artificial fashion shows without our united 
		efforts and true conviction of love, loyalty and respects to these late 
		founding fathers and many others alike. In the deepest sense, our head 
		grown, calculated and biased attitude towards those leaders and freedom 
		fighters who contributed to this nation's creation, shall generate a bad 
		illustration of our mean mentality to the future generation. We need to 
		rethink with our knowledge, judgment and wisdom and should award all the 
		befitting seats they deserve to those asterisk souls.<br>
		<br>
		So, who is the father of our motherland? Isn't he Sheik Mujibur Rahman? 
		Is anyone else coming forward to challenge or replace him? Do we really 
		need a father of the nation? How many nations in this modern world have 
		&quot;father of the nation&quot;? Is it anything wrong to have one of our own? Why 
		Mujib should be the father of the nation or why he shouldn't be? If 
		indeed he fathered this nation, what kind of father was he? During mid 
		March to 25 March 1971, what was in Mujib's mind while he was engaged in 
		marathon negotiations with butcher Yahia and Prince Bhutto? What exactly 
		were they trying to resolve? Was it any freedom of Bangladesh or just 
		formation of a new Government of Pakistan? If Bangladesh was in his mind 
		beforehand, then why didn't he stealthily disappear to call and fight 
		for our freedom? If Prince Bhutto would have agreed with Mujib on power 
		sharing, what could possibly be the outcome of their negotiation? What 
		were the exact successes of Mujib AFTER his arrival from Pakistan until 
		he and his almost entire family members including minor child were 
		mercilessly killed? How did the nation exactly react immediately after 
		his gruesome killing and why? Was it a punishment, revenge or a national 
		award to Mujib? And what role did Awami League leadership play 
		immediately after his death?<br>
		<br>
		You see, there could thousands of curious questions as above while the 
		nation would be considering calling him father of the nation but at the 
		end of all these dogmatic fights, the dispositions or decisions shall 
		only move to all reversed directions. Thus, in depth analysis of all 
		those inquiries are irrelevant when the nation is solemnly recognizing 
		this ceremonial but the most honorable place in our history of 
		independence.<br>
		<br>
		This nation can not even start its history of birth (creation) without 
		Mujib. The most powerful nationalist political leader in the history of 
		Bangladesh, Mujib has a long political celebrity career. For his 
		leadership in the liberation struggle of Bangladesh as well as for his 
		patriotic struggles and battles for many years for the freedom of the 
		&quot;Bengali people&quot; of former East Pakistan, he became nation's founding 
		father, also known as &quot;BangaBandhu&quot;. Mujib was involved in raising 
		issues of all the institutional discrimination against Bengalis in 
		Pakistan that led him to the concepts of his 6 Points. His movement's 
		main agenda was the realization of the 6 demands put forward to end the 
		exploitation of East Pakistan by the West Pakistani rulers. His Movement 
		was a &quot;Bengali nationalist movement&quot; in East Pakistan, conceiving for 
		the first time toward the birth of a free nation, a new country for all 
		of us.<br>
		<br>
		In December 1970 election, Mujib's leadership won a massive majority in 
		the Pakistani Provincial legislature and all but 2 of East Pakistan's 
		quota of seats thus forming a clear majority. As the talks between 
		butcher Yahya, Mujib and Prince Bhutto collapsed; Mujib led defiantly a 
		&quot;Resistance Day&quot; on March 23, 1971 in East Pakistan instead of the 
		traditional all-Pakistan &quot;Republic Day&quot;. Yahya decided to solve the 
		problem of East Pakistan by repression. On the evening of March 25, he 
		flew back to Islamabad. The military crackdown in East Pakistan began 
		that same night. The Pakistan Army launched a brutal and terror campaign 
		calculated to intimidate the Bengalis into submission. Within hours a 
		wholesale slaughter had commenced in Dhaka with the heaviest attacks 
		concentrated on the University of Dhaka and the Hindu area of the old 
		town. Mujib was captured (?) and flown to West Pakistan for 
		incarceration.<br>
		<br>
		Mujib arrived in Dhaka to a rancorous welcome on 10 January 1972 and 
		first assumed the title of President but vacated that office two days 
		later to become the Prime Minister. His government was plagued by 
		corruption, intrigue, infighting and insurgency by the ultra-left 
		activists as well as reactionary forces that opposed independence. The 
		economy was devastated by a famine in 1974 and some exaggerated accounts 
		of the famine contributed to further discredit his Government. Mujib 
		pushed through a new constitution and adopted it on 04 November 1972 to 
		have a Prime minister appointed by the president and approved by a 
		single-house parliament. The Constitution enumerates a number of 
		principles on which Bangladesh is to be governed. These have come to be 
		known as the tenets of &quot;Mujibism&quot; (Mujibbad) which include the four 
		pillars of nationalism, socialism, secularism, and democracy.<br>
		<br>
		The Constitution was amended again in January 1975 to make Mujib 
		President for five years and to give him full executive powers. He wiped 
		out all opposition political parties and proclaimed Bangladesh a 
		one-party state in February1975, effectively abolishing the 
		Parliamentary system. He renamed the Awami League the &quot;Bangladesh 
		Krishak Sramik Awami League&quot; (BAKSAL) and required all civilian 
		Government personnel to join the party. The fundamental rights in the 
		Constitution were ceased and Bangladesh was transformed into a personal 
		dictatorship. A paramilitary force (Rakkhi Bahini) loyalist to the party 
		was raised that was ruthlessly used to subdue any opposition. This force 
		was responsible for many extra-judicial killings of mainly left-wing 
		extremists.<br>
		<br>
		On 15 August 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman with several other members of 
		his family including minors was brutally killed in a military coup. In a 
		wider sense, some disaffected officers and several hundred troops they 
		led, represented the grievances of the professionals in the military 
		over their subordination to the &quot;Rakkhi Bahini&quot; and Mujib's indifference 
		to gross corruption by his political subordinates and family members. 
		Although initially given the appearance of an act of revenge by a group 
		of disgruntled junior army officers, facts later emerged that presented 
		evidence of a long-planned conspiracy. Some cabinet ministers, 
		bureaucrats wary of civilian power and military leaders claiming the 
		full glory of the war of independence participated in this coup. Mujib 
		was replaced by one of the conspirators, his own former minister of 
		commerce Khondaker Mostaq Ahmed.<br>
		<br>
		Nevertheless, Sheikh Mujib proved to be a charismatic politician and a 
		national leader but his &quot;administrative leadership&quot; was not as effective 
		as his &quot;political leadership and Statesmanship&quot;. His love for the then 
		75 million of people of East Pakistan and patriotism were intransigent. 
		Mujib had a vision for success and prosperity of this nation but had no 
		precious plan of actions in place to accomplish his mission. However, it 
		was never his perfidy. Thus, none of these should make his many years' 
		dedication and intrepid struggle any lighter or should create any cloud 
		on his patriotism, political leadership and true love for this nation. 
		He deserves nation's accolade for ever.</font></div>
