	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">BY SCOTT MACLEOD/JOHANNESBURG The 
	image presaged no celebration: a child barely alive, a vulture so eager for 
	carrion. Yet the photograph that epitomized Sudan's famine would win Kevin 
	Carter fame - and hopes for anchoring a career spent hounding the news, 
	free-lancing in war zones, waiting anxiously for assignments amid dire 
	finances, staying in the line of fire for that one great picture. On May 23, 
	14 months after capturing that memorable scene, Carter walked up to the dais 
	in the classical rotunda of Columbia University's Low Memorial Library and 
	received the Pulitzer Prize for feature photography. The South African 
	soaked up the attention. &quot;I swear I got the most applause of anybody,&quot; 
	Carter wrote back to his parents in Johannesburg. &quot;I can't wait to show you 
	the trophy. It is the most precious thing, and the highest acknowledgment of 
	my work I could receive.&quot; </font></p>

	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Carter was feted at some of the most 
	fashionable spots in New York City. Restaurant patrons, overhearing his 
	claim to fame, would come up and ask for his autograph. Photo editors at the 
	major magazines wanted to meet the new hotshot, dressed in his black jeans 
	and T shirts, with the tribal bracelets and diamond-stud earring, with the 
	war-weary eyes and tales from the front lines of Nelson Mandela's new South 
	Africa. Carter signed with Sygma, a prestigious picture agency representing 
	200 of the world's best photojournalists. &quot;It can be a very glamorous 
	business,&quot; says Sygma's U.S. director, Eliane Laffont. &quot;It's very hard to 
	make it, but Kevin is one of the few who really broke through. The pretty 
	girls were falling for him, and everybody wanted to hear what he had to 
	say.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There would be little time for that. 
	Two months after receiving his Pulitzer, Carter would be dead of 
	carbon-monoxide poisoning in Johannesburg, a suicide at 33. His red pickup 
	truck was parked near a small river where he used to play as a child; a 
	green garden hose attached to the vehicle's exhaust funneled the fumes 
	inside. &quot;I'm really, really sorry,&quot; he explained in a note left on the 
	passenger seat beneath a knapsack. &quot;The pain of life overrides the joy to 
	the point that joy does not exist.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How could a man who had moved so 
	many people with his work end up a suicide so soon after his great triumph? 
	The brief obituaries that appeared around the world suggested a morality 
	tale about a person undone by the curse of fame. The details, however, show 
	how fame was only the final, dramatic sting of a death foretold by Carter's 
	personality, the pressure to be first where the action is, the fear that his 
	pictures were never good enough, the existential lucidity that came to him 
	from surviving violence again and again - and the drugs he used to banish 
	that lucidity. If there is a paramount lesson to be drawn from Carter's 
	meteoric rise and fall, it is that tragedy does not always have heroic 
	dimensions. &quot;I have always had it all at my feet,&quot; read the last words of 
	his suicide note, &quot;but being me just fit up anyway.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First, there was history. Kevin 
	Carter was born in 1960, the year Nelson Mandela's African National Congress 
	was outlawed. Descended from English immigrants, Carter was not part of the 
	Afrikaner mainstream that ruled the country. Indeed, its ideology appalled 
	him. Yet he was caught up in its historic misadventure. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His devoutly Roman Catholic parents, 
	Jimmy and Roma, lived in Parkmore, a tree-lined Johannesburg suburb - and 
	they accepted apartheid. Kevin, however, like many of his generation, soon 
	began to question it openly. &quot;The police used to go around arresting black 
	people for not carrying their passes,&quot; his mother recalls. &quot;They used to 
	treat them very badly, and we felt unable to do anything about it. But Kevin 
	got very angry about it. He used to have arguments with his father. &quot;Why 
	couldn't we do something about it? Why didn't we go shout at those police?' 
	&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Though Carter insisted he loved his 
	parents, he told his closest friends his childhood was unhappy. As a 
	teenager, he found his thrills riding motorcycles and fantasized about 
	becoming a race-car driver. After graduating from a Catholic boarding school 
	in Pretoria in 1976, Carter studied pharmacy before dropping out with bad 
	grades a year later. Without a student deferment, he was conscripted into 
	the South African Defense Force, where he found upholding the apartheid 
	regime loathsome. Once, after he took the side of a black mess-hall waiter, 
	some Afrikaans-speaking soldiers called him a kaffir-boetie (&quot;nigger lover&quot;) 
	and beat him up. In 1980 Carter went absent without leave, rode a motorcycle 
	to Durban and, calling himself David, became a disk jockey. He longed to see 
	his family but felt too ashamed to return. One day after he lost his job, he 
	swallowed scores of sleeping pills, pain-killers and rat poison. He 
	survived. He returned to the S.A.D.F. to finish his service and was injured 
	in 1983 while on guard duty at air force headquarters in Pretoria. A bomb 
	attributed to the A.N.C. had exploded, killing 19 people. After leaving the 
	service, Carter got a job at a camera supply shop and drifted into 
	journalism, first as a weekend sports photographer for the Johannesburg 
	Sunday Express. When riots began sweeping the black townships in 1984, 
	Carter moved to the Johannesburg Star and aligned himself with the crop of 
	young, white photojournalists who wanted to expose the brutality of 
	apartheid - a mission that had once been the almost exclusive calling of 
	South Africa's black photographers. &quot;They put themselves in face of danger, 
	were arrested numerous times, but never quit. They literally were willing to 
	sacrifice themselves for what they believed in,&quot; says American 
	photojournalist James Nachtwey, who frequently worked with Carter and his 
	friends. By 1990, civil war was raging between Mandela's A.N.C. and the 
	Zulu-supported Inkatha Freedom Party. For whites, it became potentially 
	fatal to work the townships alone. To diminish the dangers, Carter hooked up 
	with three friends - Ken Oosterbroek of the Star and free-lancers Greg 
	Marinovich and Joao Silva - and they began moving through Soweto and Tokoza 
	at dawn. If a murderous gang was going to shoot up a bus, throw someone off 
	a train or cut up somebody on the street, it was most likely to happen as 
	township dwellers began their journeys to work in the soft, shadowy light of 
	an African morning. The four became so well known for capturing the violence 
	that Living, a Johannesburg magazine, dubbed them &quot;the Bang-Bang Club.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Even with the teamwork, however, 
	cruising the townships was often a perilous affair. Well-armed government 
	security forces used excessive firepower. The chaotic hand-to-hand street 
	fighting between black factions involved AK-47s, spears and axes. &quot;At a 
	funeral some mourners caught one guy, hacked him, shot him, ran over him 
	with a car and set him on fire,&quot; says Silva, describing a typical encounter. 
	&quot;My first photo showed this guy on the ground as the crowd told him they 
	were going to kill him. We were lucky to get away.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Sometimes it took more than a camera 
	and camaraderie to get through the work. Marijuana, known locally as dagga, 
	is widely available in South Africa. Carter and many other photojournalists 
	smoked it habitually in the townships, partly to relieve tension and partly 
	to bond with gun-toting street warriors. Although he denied it, Carter, like 
	many hard-core dagga users, moved on to something more dangerous: smoking 
	the &quot;white pipe,&quot; a mixture of dagga and Mandrax, a banned tranquilizer 
	containing methaqualone. It provides an intense, immediate kick and then 
	allows the user to mellow out for an hour or two. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">By 1991, working on the dawn patrol 
	had paid off for one of the Bang-Bang Club. Marinovich won a Pulitzer for 
	his September 1990 photographs of a Zulu being stabbed to death by A.N.C. 
	supporters. That prize raised the stakes for the rest of the club - 
	especially Carter. And for Carter other comparisons cropped up. Though 
	Oosterbroek was his best friend, they were, according to Nachtwey, &quot;like the 
	polarities of personality types. Ken was the successful photographer with 
	the loving wife. His life was in order.&quot; Carter had bounced from romance to 
	romance, fathering a daughter out of wedlock. In 1993 Carter headed north of 
	the border with Silva to photograph the rebel movement in famine-stricken 
	Sudan. To make the trip, Carter had taken a leave from the Weekly Mail and 
	borrowed money for the air fare. Immediately after their plane touched down 
	in the village of Ayod, Carter began snapping photos of famine victims. 
	Seeking relief from the sight of masses of people starving to death, he 
	wandered into the open bush. He heard a soft, high-pitched whimpering and 
	saw a tiny girl trying to make her way to the feeding center. As he crouched 
	to photograph her, a vulture landed in view. Careful not to disturb the 
	bird, he positioned himself for the best possible image. He would later say 
	he waited about 20 minutes, hoping the vulture would spread its wings. It 
	did not, and after he took his photographs, he chased the bird away and 
	watched as the little girl resumed her struggle. Afterward he sat under a 
	tree, lit a cigarette, talked to God and cried. &quot;He was depressed 
	afterward,&quot; Silva recalls. &quot;He kept saying he wanted to hug his daughter.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">After another day in Sudan, Carter 
	returned to Johannesburg. Coincidentally, the New York Times, which was 
	looking for pictures of Sudan, bought his photograph and ran it on March 26, 
	1993. The picture immediately became an icon of Africa's anguish. Hundreds 
	of people wrote and called the Times asking what had happened to the child 
	(the paper reported that it was not known whether she reached the feeding 
	center); and papers around the world reproduced the photo. Friends and 
	colleagues complimented Carter on his feat. His self-confidence climbed.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Carter quit the Weekly Mail and 
	became a free-lance photojournalist - an alluring but financially risky way 
	of making a living, providing no job security, no health insurance and no 
	death benefits. He eventually signed up with the Reuter news agency for a 
	guarantee of roughly $2,000 a month and began to lay plans for covering his 
	country's first multiracial elections in April. The next few weeks, however, 
	would bring depression and self-doubt, only momentarily interrupted by 
	triumph. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The troubles started on March 11. 
	Carter was covering the unsuccessful invasion of Bophuthatswana by white 
	right-wing vigilantes intent on propping up a black homeland, a showcase of 
	apartheid. Carter found himself just feet away from the summary execution of 
	right-wingers by a black &quot;Bop&quot; policeman. &quot;Lying in the middle of the 
	gunfight,&quot; he said, &quot;I was wondering about which millisecond next I was 
	going to die, about putting something on film they could use as my last 
	picture.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His pictures would eventually be 
	splashed across front pages around the world, but he came away from the 
	scene in a funk. First, there was the horror of having witnessed murder. 
	Perhaps as importantly, while a few colleagues had framed the scene 
	perfectly, Carter was reloading his camera with film just as the executions 
	took place. &quot;I knew I had missed this f--- shot,&quot; he said subsequently. &quot;I 
	drank a bottle of bourbon that night.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the same time, he seemed to be 
	stepping up his drug habit, including smoking the white pipe. A week after 
	the Bop executions, he was seen staggering around while on assignment at a 
	Mandela rally in Johannesburg. Later he crashed his car into a suburban 
	house and was thrown in jail for 10 hours on suspicion of drunken driving. 
	His superior at Reuter was furious at having to go to the police station to 
	recover Carter's film of the Mandela event. Carter's girlfriend, Kathy 
	Davidson, a schoolteacher, was even more upset. Drugs had become a growing 
	issue in their one-year relationship. Over Easter, she asked Carter to move 
	out until he cleaned up his life. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With only weeks to go before the 
	elections, Carter's job at Reuter was shaky, his love life was in jeopardy 
	and he was scrambling to find a new place to live. And then, on April 12, 
	1994, the New York Times phoned to tell him he had won the Pulitzer. As 
	jubilant Times foreign picture editor Nancy Buirski gave him the news, 
	Carter found himself rambling on about his personal problems. &quot;Kevin!&quot; she 
	interrupted, &quot;You've just won a Pulitzer! These things aren't going to be 
	that important now.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Early on Monday, April 18, the 
	Bang-Bang Club headed out to Tokoza township, 10 miles from downtown 
	Johannesburg, to cover an outbreak of violence. Shortly before noon, with 
	the sun too bright for taking good pictures, Carter returned to the city. 
	Then on the radio he heard that his best friend, Oosterbroek, had been 
	killed in Tokoza. Marinovich had been gravely wounded. Oosterbroek's death 
	devastated Carter, and he returned to work in Tokoza the next day, even 
	though the violence had escalated. He later told friends that he and not Ken 
	&quot;should have taken the bullet.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">New York was a respite. By all 
	accounts, Carter made the most of his first visit to Manhattan. The Times 
	flew him in and put him up at the Marriott Marquis just off Times Square. 
	His spirits soaring, he took to calling New York &quot;my town.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With the Pulitzer, however, he had 
	to deal not only with acclaim but also with the critical focus that comes 
	with fame. Some journalists in South Africa called his prize a &quot;fluke,&quot; 
	alleging that he had somehow set up the tableau. Others questioned his 
	ethics. &quot;The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her 
	suffering,&quot; said the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times, &quot;might just as well be 
	a predator, another vulture on the scene.&quot; Even some of Carter's friends 
	wondered aloud why he had not helped the girl. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Carter was painfully aware of the 
	photojournalist's dilemma. &quot;I had to think visually,&quot; he said once, 
	describing a shoot-out. &quot;I am zooming in on a tight shot of the dead guy and 
	a splash of red. Going into his khaki uniform in a pool of blood in the 
	sand. The dead man's face is slightly gray. You are making a visual here. 
	But inside something is screaming, &quot;My God.' But it is time to work. Deal 
	with the rest later. If you can't do it, get out of the game.&quot; Says Nachtwey, 
	&quot;Every photographer who has been involved in these stories has been 
	affected. You become changed forever. Nobody does this kind of work to make 
	themselves feel good. It is very hard to continue.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Carter did not look forward to going 
	home. Summer was just beginning in New York, but late June was still winter 
	in South Africa, and Carter became depressed almost as soon as he got off 
	the plane. &quot;Joburg is dry and brown and cold and dead, and so damn full of 
	bad memories and absent friends,&quot; he wrote in a letter never mailed to a 
	friend, Esquire picture editor Marianne Butler in New York. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Nevertheless, Carter carefully 
	listed story ideas and faxed some of them off to Sygma. Work did not proceed 
	smoothly. Though it was not his fault, Carter felt guilty when a 
	bureaucratic foul-up caused the cancellation of an interview by a writer 
	from Parade magazine, a Sygma client, with Mandela in Cape Town. Then came 
	an even more unpleasant experience. Sygma told Carter to stay in Cape Town 
	and cover French President Francois Mitterrand's state visit to South 
	Africa. The story was spot news, but according to editors at Sygma's Paris 
	office, Carter shipped his film too late to be of use. In any case, they 
	complained, the quality of the photos was too poor to offer to Sygma's 
	clients. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to friends, Carter began 
	talking openly about suicide. Part of his anxiety was over the Mitterrand 
	assignment. But mostly he seemed worried about money and making ends meet. 
	When an assignment in Mozambique for TIME came his way, he eagerly accepted. 
	Despite setting three alarm clocks to make his early-morning flight on July 
	20, he missed the plane. Furthermore, after six days in Mozambique, he 
	walked off his return flight to Johannesburg, leaving a package of 
	undeveloped film on his seat. He realized his mistake when he arrived at a 
	friend's house. He raced back to the airport but failed to turn up anything. 
	Carter was distraught and returned to the friend's house in the morning, 
	threatening to smoke a white pipe and gas himself to death. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Carter and a friend, Judith Matloff, 
	36, an American correspondent for Reuter, dined on Mozambican prawns he had 
	brought back. He was apparently too ashamed to tell her about the lost film. 
	Instead they discussed their futures. Carter proposed forming a 
	writer-photographer free-lance team and traveling Africa together. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the morning of Wednesday, July 
	27, the last day of his life, Carter appeared cheerful. He remained in bed 
	until nearly noon and then went to drop off a picture that had been 
	requested by the Weekly Mail. In the paper's newsroom, he poured out his 
	anguish to former colleagues, one of whom gave him the number of a therapist 
	and urged him to phone her. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The last person to see Carter alive, 
	it seems, was Oosterbroek's widow, Monica. As night fell, Carter turned up 
	unannounced at her home to vent his troubles. Still recovering from her 
	husband's death three months earlier, she was in little condition to offer 
	counsel. They parted at about 5:30 p.m. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Braamfonteinspruit is a small 
	river that cuts southward through Johannesburg's northern suburbs - and 
	through Parkmore, where the Carters once lived. At around 9 p.m., Kevin 
	Carter backed his red Nissan pickup truck against a blue gum tree at the 
	Field and Study Center. He had played there often as a little boy. The 
	Sandton Bird Club was having its monthly meeting there, but nobody saw 
	Carter as he used silver gaffer tape to attach a garden hose to the exhaust 
	pipe and run it to the passenger-side window. Wearing unwashed Lee jeans and

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The suicide note he left behind is a 
	litany of nightmares and dark visions, a clutching attempt at autobiography, 
	self-analysis, explanation, excuse. After coming home from New York, he 
	wrote, he was &quot;depressed . . . without phone . . . money for rent . . . 
	money for child support . . . money for debts . . . money!!! . . . I am 
	haunted by the vivid memories of killings &amp; corpses &amp; anger &amp; pain . . . of 
	starving or wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of 
	killer executioners . . . &quot; And then this: &quot;I have gone to join Ken if I am 
	that lucky.&quot; </font></p>
