          <p><b><font color="#000000">‘Manu’s is a degraded and degenerate
          philosophy&nbsp;</font></b><br>
          <b><font color="#000000">of Superman as compared with that of
          Nietzsche and therefore far more odious and loathsome than the
          philosophy of Nietzsche’</font></b>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">The foregoing analysis of the&nbsp;
          religious revolution showed&nbsp; that religious ideas as forms&nbsp;
          of divine governance for hu man Society fall into two classes, one in
          which Society is the centre and the other in which the Individual is
          the centre. The same analysis showed that for the former the
          appropriate test of what is good and what is right, i.e., the test of
          the moral order is utility while for the latter the test is justice.&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Now the reason why the philosophy of
          Hinduism does not answer the test of utility or of justice is because
          the religious ideal of Hinduism for divine governance of human society
          is an ideal which falls into a separate class by itself. It is an
          ideal in which the individual is not the centre. The centre of the
          ideal is neither individual nor society. It is a class — the class
          of Supermen called Brahmins.&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Those who will bear the dominant and
          devastating fact in mind will understand why the philosophy of
          Hinduism is not founded on individual justice or social utility. The
          philosophy of Hinduism is founded on a totally different principle. To
          the question what is right and what is good the answer which the
          philosophy of Hinduism gives is remarkable. It holds that to be right
          and good the act must serve the interests of this class of Supermen,
          namely, the Brahmins.&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Oscar Wilde said that to be
          intelligible is to be found out. Indeed Manu does not leave it to be
          found out. He expresses his view in resonant and majestic notes as who
          are the Supermen and anything which serves the interest of the
          Supermen is alone entitled to be called right and good. Let me quote
          Manu.</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">X. 3. “On account of his
          pre-eminence, on account of the superiority of his origin, on account
          of his observance of (particular) restrictive rules, and on account of
          his particular sanctification the Brahman is the Lord of (all) Varnas.”</font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">He proceeds to amplify his
          reasons and does so in the following characteristic manner —</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">I. 93. “As the Brahmana sprang from (Prajapati’s,
          i.e. God’s) mouth, as he was first–born and as he possesses the
          Veda, he is by right the Lord of this whole creation.”</font></font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">I. 94. For the self–existent (Svayambhu,
          i.e., God), having performed austerities, produced him first from his
          own mouth, in order that offerings might be conveyed to the Gods and
          Manes and that this universe might be preserved.”</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">I. 95. “What created being can
          surpass him, through whose mouth the Gods continually consume the
          sacrificial viands and the manes the offerings to the dead?”</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">I. 96. “Of created beings the most
          excellent are said to be those which are animated; of the animated,
          those who subsist by intelligence; of the intelligent, mankind; and of
          the men, the Brahmanas.”</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Besides the reason given by Manu the
          Brahmin is first in rank because he was produced by God from his
          mouth, in order that the offerings might be conveyed to the Gods and
          manes. Manu gives another reason for the supremacy of the Brahmins. He
          says —</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">I. 98. “The very birth of a
          Brahmana is an eternal incarnation of the sacred Law (Veda); for he is
          born to (fulfill) the sacred law, and becomes one with Brahman
          (God).”</font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">I. 99. “A Brahmana, coming
          into existence, is born as the highest on earth, the lord of all
          created beings, for the protection of the treasury of the Law.”</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">Manu concludes by saying that —</font></font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">I. 101. “The Brahman eats
          but his own food, wears but his own apparel, bestows but his own in
          alms; other mortals subsist through the benevolence of the Brahmana.”</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">Because according to Manu —</font></font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">II. 100. “Whatever exists in
          the world is the property of the Brahmana; on account of the
          excellence of his origin the Brahmana is, indeed, entitled to it
          all.”</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">Manu directs —</font></font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">VII. 36. “Let the King, after
          rising early in the morning, worship Brahmans who are well versed in
          the three-fold sacred science and learned (in polity), and follow
          their advice.”</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">VII. 38. “Let him daily worship
          aged Brahmans who know the Veda and are pure...”</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">VII. 37. “Let the king, having
          risen at early dawn, respectfully attend to Brahman, learned in the
          three Vedas and in the science of ethics and by their decision let him
          abide.”</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">VII. 38. “Constantly must he show
          respect to Brahmans, who have grown old, both in years and in piety,
          who know the scriptures, who in body and mind are pure; for he, who
          honours the aged, will perpetually be honoured even by cruel
          demons.”</font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">IX. 313. “Let him not,
          although in the greatest distress for money, provoke Brahmans to anger
          by taking their property; for they, once enraged, could immediately by
          sacrifices and imprecations destroy him with his troops, elephants,
          horses and cars.”</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">Finally Manu says —</font></font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">XI. 35. “The Brahman is
          (hereby) declared (to be) the creator (of the world), the punisher,
          the teacher, (and hence) a benefactor (of all created beings); to him
          let no man say anything unpropitious; nor use any harsh words.”</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">To conclude and complete the theory of supermen
          and of what is right and good let me reproduce the following two texts
          from Manu —</font></font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">X. 122. “But let a Shudra serve
          Brahmans, either for the sake of heaven or with a view of both this
          life and the next, for he who is called the servant of a Brahman
          thereby gains all his ends.</font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">X. 123. The service of the
          Brahmana alone is declared to be as excellent occupation for a Shudra;
          for whatever else besides this he may perform will bear no fruit.</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">And Manu adds —</font></font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">X. 129. No collection of wealth must
          be made by a Shudra, even though he be able to do it; for a Shudra who
          has acquired wealth gives pain to Brahman.</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">The above texts from Manu disclose
          the core and the heart of the philosophy of Hinduism. Hinduism is the
          gospel of the Superman and it teaches that what is right for the
          Superman is the only thing which is called morally right and morally
          good.</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Is there any parallel to this
          philosophy? I hate to suggest it. But is so obvious. The parallel to
          this philosophy of Hinduism is to be found in Nietzsche. The Hindus
          will be angry at this suggestion. It is quite natural. For the
          philosophy of Nietzsche stands in great odium. It never took roots. In
          his own words he was “sometimes deified as the philosopher of the
          aristocracy and squirearchy, sometimes hooted as, sometimes pitied and
          sometimes boycotted as an inhuman being.”&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Nietzsche’s philosophy had become
          identified with will to power, violence, denial of spiritual values,
          Superman and the sacrifice, servility and debasement of the common
          man. His philosophy with these high spots had created a certain
          loathsomeness and horror in the minds of the people of his own
          generation. He was utterly neglected if not shunned and Nietzsche
          himself took comfort by placing himself among the “posthumous
          men”.</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">He foresaw for himself a remote
          public, centuries after his own time to appreciate him. Here too
          Nietzsche was destined to be disappointed. Instead of there being any
          appreciation of his philosophy, the lapse of time has only augmented
          the horror and loathing which people of his generation felt for
          Nietzsche. This is principally due to the revelation that the
          philosophy of Nietzsche is capable of producing Nazism. His friends
          have vehemently protested against such a construction (M. P. Nicolas,
          “From Nietzsche Down to Hitler” 1938). But it is not difficult to
          see that his philosophy can be as easily applied to evolve a super
          state as to Superman. This is what the Nazis have done.&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">At any rate the Nazis trace their
          ancestry from Nietzsche and regard him as their spiritual parent.
          Hitler has himself photographed beside a bust of Nietzsche; he takes
          the manuscripts of the master under his own special guardianship;
          extracts are chosen from Nietzsche’s writings and loudly proclaimed
          at the ceremonies of Nazism, as the New German Faith. Nor is the claim
          by the Nazis of spiritual ancestry with Nietzsche denied by his near
          relations. Nietzsche’s own cousin Richard Ochler approvingly says
          that Nietzsche’s thought is Hitler in action and that Nietzsche was
          the foremost pioneer of the Nazi accession to power. Nietzsche’s own
          sister, few months before her death, thanks the Feurhar for the honour
          he graciously bestows on her brother declaring that she sees in him
          that incarnation of the “Superman” foretold by Zarathustra.</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">To identify Nietzsche, whose name
          and whose philosophy excites so much horror and so much loathing, with
          Manu is sure to cause astonishment and resentment in the mind of the
          Hindus. But of the fact itself there can be no doubt. Nietzsche
          himself has openly declared that in his philosophy he only following
          the scheme of Manu. In his Anti-Christ this is what Nietzsche says —</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">“After all, the question is, to
          what end are falsehoods perpetrated? The fact that, in Christianity,
          ‘holy’ ends are entirely absent, constitutes my objection to the
          means it employs. Its ends are only bad ends; the poisoning, the
          calumniation and the denial of life, the contempt of the body, the
          degradation and self-pollution of man by virtue of the concept of sin,
          — consequently its means are bad as well. My feelings are quite the
          reverse.&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">“When I read the law book of
          Manu, an incomparably intellectual and superior work, it would be a
          sin against the spirit even to mention in the same breath with the
          Bible. You will guess immediately why; it has a genuine philosophy
          behind it, in it, not merely an evil-smelling Jewish distillation of
          Rabbinism and superstition — it gives something to chew even to the
          most fastidious psychologist. And, not to forget the most important
          point of all, it is fundamentally different from every kind of Bible:
          by means of it the noble classes, the philosophers and the warriors
          guard and guide the masses; it is replete with noble values, it is
          filled with a feeling of perfection, with saying yea to life, and
          triumphant sense of well–being in regard to itself and to life —
          the Sun shines upon the whole book.&nbsp;</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">“All those things which Christianity smothers
          with its bottomless vulgarity, procreation, woman, marriage, are here
          treated with earnestness, with reverence, with love and confidence.
          How can one possibly place in the hands of children and women, a book
          that contains those vile words: ‘to avoid fornication, let every man
          have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband... it is
          better to marry than to burn.’ And is it decent to be a Christian so
          long as the very origin of man is Christianised, that is to say,
          befouled, by the idea of the immaculate conception?...&nbsp;</font></font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">“I know of no book in which so
          many delicate and kindly things are said to woman, as in the Law Book
          of Manu; these old grey–beards and saints have a manner of being
          gallant to woman which, perhaps, cannot be surpassed. ‘The mouth of
          a woman,’ says Manu on one occasion, ‘the breast of a maiden, the
          prayer of a child, and the smoke of the sacrifice, are always pure’.
          And finally perhaps this is also a holy lie — ‘all the openings of
          the body above the navel are pure, all those below the navel are
          impure. Only in a maiden is the whole body pure.’”</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">This leaves no doubt that
          Zarathustra is a new name for Manu and that Thus Spake Zarathustra is
          a new edition of Manu Smriti.</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">If there is any difference between
          Manu and Nietzsche it lies in this. Nietzsche was genuinely interested
          in creating a new race of men which will be a race of supermen as
          compared with the existing race of men. Manu on the other hand was
          interested in maintaining the privileges of a class who had come to
          arrogate to itself the claim of being supermen. Nietzsche’s supermen
          were supermen by reason of their worth. Manu’s supermen were
          supermen by reason of their birth. Nietzsche was a genuine
          disinterested philosopher. Manu on the contrary was an hireling
          engaged to propound a philosophy which served the interests of a class
          born in a group and whose title to being supermen was not to be lost
          even if they lost their virtue.</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">Compare the following texts from
          Manu.</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">X. 81. “Yet a Brahman, unable to
          subsist by his duties just mentioned, may live by the duty of a
          soldier; for that is the next rank.”</font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">X.82. “If it be asked, how he must
          live, should he be unable to get a subsistence by either of those
          employments; the answer is, he may subsist as a mercantile man,
          applying himself into tillage and attendance on cattle.</font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Manu adds:</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">IX. 317. “A Brahmana, be he ignorant or
          learned, is a great divinity, just as the fire, whether carried forth
          (for the performance of a burnt oblation) or not carried forth, is a
          great divinity.”</font></font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">IX. 323. “Thus, though the
          Brahmans employ themselves in all (sorts) of mean occupation, they
          must be honoured in every way; (for each of) them is a very great
          deity.”</font>
          <p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Thus Manu’s is a degraded
          and degenerate philosophy of Superman as compared with that of
          Nietzsche and therefore far more odious and loathsome than the
          philosophy of Nietzsche.</font><br>
          <font color="#000000">This explains why the philosophy of Hinduism
          does not satisfy the test of justice or of utility. Hinduism is not
          interested in the common man. Hinduism is not interested in Society as
          a whole. The centre of its interest lies in a class and its philosophy
          is concerned in sustaining and supporting the rights of that class.
          That is why in the philosophy of Hinduism the interests of the common
          man as well as of society are denied, suppressed and sacrificed to the
          interest of this class of Superman…&nbsp;</font></font>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="3">It is therefore incontrovertible
          that notwithstanding the Hindu Code of Ethics, notwithstanding the
          philosophy of the Upanishads not a little not a jot did abate from the
          philosophy of Hinduism as propounded by Manu. They were ineffective
          and powerless to erase the infamy preached by Manu in the name of
          religion. Notwithstanding their existence one can still say,
          “Hinduism! They name is inequality!”&nbsp;</font>
