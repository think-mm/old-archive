	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I have read and admired Bertrand 
	Russell's <i>Why I Am Not a Christian</i>. On the other hand, I have also 
	read and disagreed with M.K.Gandhi's <i>Why I Am a Hindu</i>. My 
	acquaintance with these writings has inspired me to write this essay 
	explaining why I am not a Hindu, though I was born in a Hindu family.</font></p>
	<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Meaning of &quot;Hindu&quot;</font></h3>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The word &quot;Hindu&quot; is a much-abused 
	word in the sense that it has been used to mean different things at 
	different times. For example, some people even now, at least some times, use 
	the word &quot;Hindu&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Indian&quot;. In this sense of the term, I am 
	certainly a &quot;Hindu&quot; because I do not deny being an Indian. However, I do not 
	think that this a proper use of the term &quot;Hindu&quot;. There are many Indians 
	such as Muslims, Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians as well as rationalists, 
	humanists and atheists who do not call themselves &quot;Hindu&quot; and also do not 
	like to be described as such. It is certainly not fair to convert them into 
	Hinduism by giving an elastic definition of the term &quot;Hindu&quot;. Besides, it is 
	also not advisable to use the word &quot;Hindu&quot; in this sense from the point of 
	view of clarity. The word &quot;Hindu&quot; may have been used in the beginning as a 
	synonym for &quot;Indian&quot; <a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[1]</a>, but, at present, 
	the word is used for people with certain definite religious beliefs. The 
	word &quot;Hindu&quot; belongs to the category of words like &quot;Muslim&quot;, &quot;Christian&quot;, 
	&quot;Buddhist&quot; and &quot;Jain&quot; and not to the category of words like &quot;American&quot;, 
	&quot;British&quot;, &quot;Australian&quot;, &quot;Chinese&quot; or &quot;Japanese&quot;. <b>There are, in fact, 
	many Indians who are not Hindus, and on the other hand, there are many 
	Hindus who are not Indians </b>, for example, those who are citizens of 
	Nepal, Sri Lanka and some other countries. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the religious sense, the word, 
	&quot;Hindu&quot; is often used broadly to include Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs in 
	addition to those who are described as &quot;Hindu&quot; in this most restricted sense 
	of the term, that is, the adherents of Vedic or Brahmin religion. For 
	example, the expression &quot;Hindu&quot; is used in the Hindu law not only for those 
	who are Hindu by religion but also for persons who are Buddhists, Jains and 
	Sikhs by religion. This, again, is too broad a definition of &quot;Hindu&quot;. If we 
	consistently use the word &quot;Hindu&quot; in this sense, we will have to say that 
	Japan is a Hindu country! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above definition of &quot;Hindu&quot; is 
	clearly inadequate from a philosophical point of view. Buddhism and Jainism, 
	for instance, explicitly reject the doctrine of the infallibility of the 
	Vedas and the system of <i>varna-vyavastha</i>, which are fundamental to 
	Hinduism, that is, if the term &quot;Hinduism&quot; is used in its most restricted 
	sense. Therefore, clubbing together Buddhists and Jains or even Sikhs with 
	those who believe in the infallibility of the Vedas and subscribe to the <i>
	varna-vyavastha</i> is nothing but an invitation to confusion. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Though I agree with Buddhism in its 
	rejection of god, soul, infallibility of the Vedas and the <i>
	varna-vyavastha</i>, still I am not a Hindu even in this broad sense of the 
	term &quot;Hindu&quot;, because as a rationalist and humanist I reject all religions 
	including Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. However, in this essay I am 
	concerned with explaining why I am not a Hindu in the most appropriate sense 
	of the term &quot;Hindu&quot;, that is, the sense in which a person is a Hindu if his 
	religion is Hinduism in the restricted sense of the term &quot; Hinduism&quot;. In 
	this restricted sense of &quot;Hinduism&quot;, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism are 
	excluded from its scope. I also maintain that this is, at present, probably 
	the most popular sense of the term, and every body should, in the interest 
	of clarity, confine its use, as far as possible, to this sense only, at 
	least in philosophical discourse. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Radhakrishnan, for example, has used 
	the term &quot;Hindu&quot; and &quot;Hinduism&quot; in this restricted sense when he says in his
	<i>The Hindu View of Life </i>that, &quot;The chief sacred scriptures of Hindus, 
	the Vedas register the intuitions of the perfected souls.&quot;
	<a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[2]</a> Or, when he says that &quot;Hinduism is the 
	religion not only of the Vedas but of the Epics and the Puranas.&quot;
	<a name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> </font></p>
	<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Basic Beliefs of Hinduism </font>
	</h3>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Gandhi, too, has used the term 
	&quot;Hindu&quot; in this restricted sense, when writing in <i>Young India </i>in 
	October, 1921, he says: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I call myself a <i>sanatani</i> 
	Hindu, because, </font></p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe in the Vedas, the 
		Upanishads, the Puranas and all that goes by the name of Hindu 
		scriptures, and therefore in <i>avatars</i> and rebirth. </font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe in the <i>Varnashram 
		dharma </i>in a sense in my opinion strictly Vedic, but not in its 
		present popular and crude sense. </font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I believe in the protection of 
		the cow in its much larger sense than the popular. </font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I do not disbelieve in 
		idol-worship. <a name="fnB4" href="#fn4">[4]</a> </font></li>
	</ol>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One may be tempted to ask, at this 
	point, whether all the beliefs listed by Gandhi are really fundamental to 
	Hinduism. In my opinion, (I) the belief in the authenticity of the Vedas and 
	(II) the belief in the <i>varnashram dharma </i>are more basic to Hinduism 
	than the belief in cow-protection and idol-worship.
	<a name="fnB5" href="#fn5">[5]</a> Though it cannot be denied that, in spite 
	of attempts by reformers like Kabir, Rammohan Roy and Dayanand Saraswati, 
	idol-worship is still practiced widely by the Hindu masses, and there is, at 
	present, a taboo on eating beef among a large number of Hindus. In any case, 
	I am in a position to establish the fact of my not being a Hindu by 
	asserting the contradictory of each of the above statements made by Gandhi:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In other words, I assert that I am 
	not a Hindu, because, </font></p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I do not believe in the Vedas, 
		the Upanishads, the Puranas and all that goes by the name of Hindu 
		scriptures, and therefore in <i>avatars</i> and rebirth. </font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I do not believe in the <i>
		varnashram dharma </i>or <i>varna-vyavastha</i> either in the sense in 
		which it is explained in Hindu <i>dharma shastras </i>like <i>Manusmriti</i> 
		or in the so-called Vedic sense. </font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I do not believe in the Hindu 
		taboo of not eating beef. </font></li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I disbelieve in idol-worship.
		</font></li>
	</ol>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, while explaining why I am 
	not a Hindu, I will concentrate mainly on (I) the belief in the authenticity 
	of the Vedas, and (II) the <i>varnashram dharma </i>, which I consider more 
	fundamental to Hinduism. Besides, in the concluding section of the essay, I 
	will briefly discuss <i>moksha</i>, which is regarded as the highest end of 
	life in Hinduism, and some other Hindu doctrines like <i>karmavada </i>and
	<i>avatarvada.</i> </font></p>
	<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The infallibility of the Vedas
	</font></h3>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">First of all, let me explain what do 
	I mean by saying that &quot;I do not believe in the Vedas&quot;, and why I do not do 
	so. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The schools of ancient Indian 
	thought are generally classified by orthodox Hindu thinkers into two broad 
	categories, namely, orthodox ( <i>astika</i>) and heterodox ( <i>nastika</i>). 
	The six main Hindu systems of thought -- Mimamsa, Vedanta, Sankhya, Yoga, 
	Nyaya and Vaisheshika -- are regarded as orthodox ( <i>astika</i>), not 
	because they believe in the existence of god, but because they accept the 
	authority of the Vedas. <a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[6]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Out of the six orthodox systems of 
	Hindu thought, Nyaya system is primarily concerned with the conditions of 
	correct thinking and the means of acquiring true knowledge. According to 
	Nyaya system, there are four distinct and separate sources of knowledge, 
	namely, (i) perception (ii) inference (iii) comparison, and (iv) testimony 
	or <i>shabda</i>. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>Shabda</i>, which is defined in 
	the Nyaya system as &quot;valid verbal testimony&quot; is further classified into (i) 
	the scriptural (<i>vaidika</i>), and (ii) the secular (<i>laukika</i>). <b>
	Vaidika or scriptural testimony is believed to be the word of god, and 
	therefore, it is regarded as perfect and infallible </b>.<a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[7]</a>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mimamsa or Purva Mimamsa, another 
	orthodox Hindu system is &quot;the outcome of the ritualistic side of the vedic 
	culture&quot;. However, in its attempt to justify the authority of the Vedas, 
	Mimamsa elaborately discusses different sources of valid knowledge. 
	Naturally enough, among the various &quot;sources of valid knowledge&quot;, Mimamsa 
	pays greatest attention to testimony or authority, which, too, is regarded 
	by it as a valid source of knowledge. There are, according to Mimamsa, two 
	kinds of authority -- personal (<i>paurusheya</i>) and impersonal (<i>apaurusheya</i>). The authority of the Vedas is regarded by Mimamsa as 
	impersonal. <a name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[8]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As mentioned earlier, according to 
	Nyaya, the authority of the Vedas is derived from their being the words of 
	god. But Mimamsa, which does not believe in the existence of god, declares 
	that the Vedas like the world, are eternal. They are not the work of any 
	person, human or divine. The infallibility of the authority of the Vedas, 
	according to Mimamsa, rests on the &quot;fact&quot; that they are not vitiated by any 
	defect to which the work of imperfect persons is liable.
	<a name="fnB9" href="#fn9">[9]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus, orthodox Hindu schools like 
	Nyaya and Mimamsa regard the testimony of the Vedas as infallible, though 
	they give different reasons for doing so. Well-known orthodox Hindu 
	theologians like Shankar and Ramanuja believed in the authority of the 
	Vedas. <i>Manusmriti</i>, too, upholds the infallibility of the Vedas. As 
	pointed out by S.N.Dasgupta, &quot;The validity and authority of the Vedas were 
	acknowledged by all Hindu writers and they had wordy battles over it with 
	the Buddhists who denied it.&quot; <a name="fnB10" href="#fn10">[10]</a> </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The point worth noting is that 
	though popularly Hinduism is a theistic religion, <b>it is not essential to 
	believe in the existence of god for being an orthodox Hindu -- belief in the 
	authority of the Vedas is more important. </b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When I say, &quot;I do not believe in the 
	Vedas&quot;, what I mean is that <b>I do not regard the testimony of the Vedas as 
	a valid source of knowledge. </b>In other words when I say, &quot;I do not 
	believe in the Vedas&quot;, I do not mean that each and every proposition 
	contained in the Vedas is false. It is quite possible that one may find a 
	few true statements in the Vedas after great amount of patient research. But 
	I assert that the truth or the falsity of a proposition is logically 
	independent of its being contained or not contained in the Vedas. A 
	proposition is true if there is a correspondence between the belief 
	expressed by it and the facts. Otherwise, it is false. So, a proposition 
	contained in the Vedas might be true, that is, if there is a correspondence 
	between the belief expressed by it and the facts, but it is, I insist, not 
	true <b>because</b> it is contained in the Vedas. I categorically reject as 
	invalid every argument of the form: &quot;The proposition P is contained in the 
	Vedas. <b>Therefore</b>, the proposition P is true&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Besides, I also assert that some 
	propositions contained in the Vedas are certainly false. For example, 
	according to <i>Purusha-Sukta</i> of <i>Rig Veda </i>, <i>Brahmins</i>, <i>
	Kshatriyas</i>, <i>Vaishyas</i> and <i>Shudras </i>originated respectively 
	from the mouth, hands, thighs and feet of the <i>purusha</i> or the creator. 
	I categorically reject this statement as false. I maintain that <i>
	varna-vyavastha</i> is a man-made social institution and it has nothing to 
	do with the alleged creator of this world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I also reject both the reasons put 
	forward in support of the infallibility of the Vedas. I neither regard them 
	to be &quot;the words of god&quot; nor I consider them to be eternal and impersonal. I 
	believe that Vedas were conceived, spoken and written by human beings. The 
	question of their being &quot;words of god&quot; simply does not arise, because there 
	are no good reasons for believing in the existence of god. The existence of 
	an omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent god is totally inconsistent with 
	the presence of suffering and evil in this world. It is impossible for god 
	to exist. <a name="fnB11" href="#fn11">[11]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly, Vedas could not have come 
	into existence before human beings appeared on this earth, and before 
	Sanskrit language came into existence. And there are no good reasons for 
	believing that Sanskrit language came into existence even before human 
	beings appeared on this earth! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As far as Gandhi is concerned, 
	though he liked to describe himself as a <i>sanatani</i> Hindu, he was, in 
	fact, not a completely orthodox Hindu. For example, in the article quoted 
	earlier in this essay Gandhi goes on to add, &quot;I do not believe in the 
	exclusive divinity of the Vedas. <b>I believe the Bible, the Koran, and the 
	Zend-Avesta to be as much divinely inspired as the Vedas. </b>My belief in 
	the Hindu scriptures <b>does not require me to accept every word and every 
	verse as divinely inspired, </b>I decline to be bound by any interpretation, 
	however learned in may be, <b>if it is repugnant to reason or moral sense.
	</b>&quot;<a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[12]</a>(emphasis mine) </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I seriously doubt that this position 
	will be acceptable to an orthodox Hindu. In fact, Gandhi's position comes 
	very close to that of rationalists and humanists when he says that &quot;I 
	decline to be bound by any interpretation however learned it may be, if it 
	is repugnant to reason and moral sense&quot;. However, since he refused to say in 
	so many words that he did not believe in the authority of the Vedas, Gandhi 
	may be described, in my opinion, as a liberal Hindu with an eclectic 
	approach towards religion. On the other hand, my position is radically 
	different from that of Gandhi, because I do not consider either the Vedas or 
	the Bible, the Koran and Zend-Avesta or any other book to be divinely 
	inspired. </font></p>
	<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><em>Varna-vyavastha</em></font></h3>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Before discussing <i>varna-vyavastha</i> 
	or <i>varnashram dharma</i>, let me clarify in the very beginning that I am 
	not interested in giving my own interpretation of what <i>varna-vyavastha</i> 
	is or ought to be in its ideal form. I am interested, firstly, in giving an 
	objective exposition of <i>varna-vyavastha</i> as contained in recognized 
	Hindu scriptures like Vedas and <i>dharmashastras</i> like <i>Manusmriti</i>; 
	and secondly, in mentioning my reasons for rejecting <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. 
	In doing so I will concentrate on the <i>chaturvarnya </i>(four-fold 
	division of society) aspect of <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">We have already noted that the first 
	reference to <i>varna</i> (class based on birth or caste) is to be found in 
	the <i>Purusha-Sukta</i> of the <i>Rig Veda </i>. The reference to the four
	<i>ashrams </i>or stages of life, namely, <i>Brahmcharya</i>, <i>Garhastya</i>,
	<i>Vanprashta </i>and <i>Sanyas</i> is to be found in the Upanishads. These 
	are, in their turn, related to the four <i>purusarthas</i> or ends of life, 
	namely, <i>dharma</i> (duty), <i>artha </i>(wealth), <i>kama </i>
	(satisfaction of sensual desires) and <i>moksha</i> (liberation). Out of 
	these, the Upanishads attach maximum value to <i>sanyas ashram </i>and <i>
	moksha</i> <i>purusartha</i>, which is regarded as the highest end of life.
	<a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[13]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The system of <i>varnashram dharma
	</i>is upheld by popular Hindu scriptures like <i>Ramayana</i>, <i>
	Mahabharata </i>and <i>Bhagvat-Gita</i>. In <i>Ramayana</i>, for example, 
	Ram kills Shambuka simply because he was performing <i>tapasya</i> (ascetic 
	exercises) which he was not supposed to do as he was a <i>Shudra</i> by 
	birth. <a name="fnB14" href="#fn14">[14]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly, in <i>Mahabharata</i>, 
	Dronacharya refuses to teach archery to Eklavya, because he was not a <i>
	Kshatriya </i>by birth. When Eklavya, treating Drona as his notional guru, 
	learns archery on his own, Drona makes him cut his right thumb as <i>
	gurudakshina</i> (gift for the teacher) so that he may not become a better

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The much-glorified <i>Bhagvat-Gita</i>, 
	too, favors <i>varna-vyavastha</i>.<a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[15]</a> 
	When Arjuna refuses to fight, one of his main worries was that the war would 
	lead to the birth of <i>varna-sankaras</i> or offspring from intermixing of 
	different <i>varnas </i>and the consequent &quot;downfall&quot; of the family.
	<a name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[16]</a> On the other hand, Krishna tries to 
	motivate Arjuna to fight by saying that it was his <i>varna-dharma</i> 
	(caste-duty) to do so because he was a <i>Kshatriya</i>. In fact, Krishna 
	goes to the extent of claiming that the four <i>varnas</i> were created by 
	him only. <a name="fnB17" href="#fn17">[17]</a> Thus, Arjuna's main problem 
	was being born a <i>Kshatriya</i>. Had he been a <i>Brahmin</i> or a <i>
	Vaishya</i> or a <i>Shudra </i>by birth, he would have been spared the 
	trouble of fighting a destructive war. Even the much-applauded doctrine of
	<i>niskama karma </i>is nothing but an exhortation to faithfully perform 
	one's <i>varnashram dharma </i>in a disinterested manner.

	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The celebrated orthodox Hindu 
	theologian Shankar, too, was a supporter of <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. 
	According to him, <i>Shudras</i> are not entitled to philosophical 
	knowledge. <a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[19]</a> However, the most elaborate 
	exposition of <i>varnashram dharma </i>is to be found in <i>Manusmriti</i>, 
	an important <i>dharmashastra</i> of Hindus. Let us turn to it in order to 
	have a close look at the <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. </font></p>
	<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><em>Manusmriti</em></font></h3>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the very first chapter of <i>
	Manusmriti</i>, it is clearly stated that <i>Brahmins</i>, <i>Kshatriyas</i>,
	<i>Vaishyas </i>and <i>Shudras </i>were created by <i>Brahma</i> (creator of 
	this world) from his mouth, hands, thighs and feet respectively.
	<a name="fnB20" href="#fn20">[20]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Manu claims that the same <i>Brahma</i>, 
	who created this world, also created <i>Manusmriti </i>and taught it to him.
	<a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[21]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The duties of the different <i>
	varnas</i> are also mentioned in the <i>Manusmriti</i>. The <i>Brahmins</i> 
	were created for teaching, studying, performing <i>yajnas </i>(ceremonial 
	sacrifices), getting <i>yajnas</i> performed, giving and accepting <i>dan
	</i>(gifts).<a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[22]</a> The <i>Kshatriyas </i>were 
	created for protecting the citizens, giving gifts, getting <i>yajnas </i>
	performed and studying. <a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[23]</a> The <i>
	Vaishyas</i> were created for protecting animals, giving gifts, getting <i>
	yajnas</i> performed, studying, trading, lending money on interest and doing 
	agricultural work. <a name="fnB24" href="#fn24">[24]</a> The <i>Shudras </i>
	were created by <i>Brahma </i>for serving <i>Brahmins </i>and the other two
	<i>varnas</i> without being critical of them. <a name="fnB25" href="#fn25">
	[25]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is interesting to note that 
	studying, getting <i>yajnas </i>performed and giving gifts or charity are 
	common duties of <i>Brahmins</i>, <i>Kshatriyas </i>and <i>Vaishyas</i>; 
	whereas teaching, accepting gifts and performing <i>yajnas</i> are reserved 
	exclusively for <i>Brahmins</i>. The Shudras, of course, are denied the 
	rights to study, getting <i>yajnas</i> performed by <i>Brahmins</i> or even 
	giving gifts to them. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>Manusmriti</i> further states 
	that having originated from the mouth of <i>Brahma</i>, being elder and 
	being the repository of the Vedas; <i>Brahmins</i> are the masters of the 
	entire universe. <a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[26]</a> Besides, <i>Brahmins</i> 
	alone act as a sort of post office for transmitting food to the gods and the 
	dead, that is to say, the gods and the dead eat food through the mouths of
	<i>Brahmins</i> (apparently because they do not have mouths of their own). 
	Therefore, no one can be superior to <i>Brahmins</i>.<a name="fnB27" href="#fn27">[27]</a> 
	All others are said to enjoy everything owing to the <i>Brahmins' </i>mercy.<a name="fnB28" href="#fn28">[28]</a> 
	The <i>Manusmriti</i> clearly states that <i>Brahmins</i> alone are entitled 
	to teach this <i>dharmashastra </i>and none else.
	<a name="fnB29" href="#fn29">[29]</a> </font></p>
	<i>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Manusmriti </font></i>
	<font face="Verdana">refers to the Vedas, which are to be regarded as the 
	main valid source of knowledge about <i>dharma</i>, as <i>shruti</i> and to
	<i>dharmashastras</i> as <i>smriti</i>. No one is to argue critically about 
	them because religion has originated from them. <a name="fnB30" href="#fn30">
	[30]</a> Any <i>nastika</i> (non-believer) or critic of the Vedas, who 
	&quot;insults&quot; them on the basis of logic, is worthy of being socially boycotted 
	by &quot;noble&quot; persons. <a name="fnB31" href="#fn31">[31]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In short, the main features of <i>
	chaturvarnya </i>as elaborated in the <i>Manusmriti </i>are as follows:
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">1. Division of Hindu society into 
	four <i>varnas</i> on the basis of birth. Out of these only the first three, 
	namely <i>, Brahmins </i>, <i>Kshatriya</i> and <i>Vaishya</i>, who are 
	collectively known as <i>dwija</i> (twice-born) are entitled to <i>upanayan</i> 
	and the study of the Vedas. <i>Shudras </i>as well as women of <i>dwija 
	varnas </i>are denied the right to study. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">2. Assigning different duties and 
	occupations for different <i>varnas</i>. This is to be enforced strictly by 
	the king. <a name="fnB32" href="#fn32">[32]</a> According to <i>Manusmriti</i>, 
	if a person of lower caste adopts the occupation of a higher caste, the king 
	ought to deprive him of all his property and expel him from his kingdom.
	<a name="fnB33" href="#fn33">[33]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">3. Treating <i>Brahmins </i>as 
	superior and other varnas, namely, <i>Kshatriya</i>, <i>Vaishya </i>and <i>
	Shudra</i> as inferior to him in descending order with the <i>Shudra </i>
	occupying the bottom of the hierarchy. A <i>Brahmin</i> is to be treated as 
	god and respected even if he is ignorant. Even a hundred-year old <i>
	Kshatriya</i> is to treat a ten year old <i>Brahmin </i>as his father.
	<a name="fnB34" href="#fn34">[34]</a> <i>Brahmin </i>alone is entitled to 
	teach. If a Shudra dares to give moral lessons to a Brahmin, the king is to 
	get him punished by pouring hot oil in his ear and mouth.
	<a name="fnB35" href="#fn35">[35]</a> Similarly, if a Shudra occupies the 
	same seat as a Brahmin, he is to be punished by branding his waist (with hot 
	rod) or getting his buttocks cut! <a name="fnB36" href="#fn36">[36]</a>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">4. Treating women as unequal. Women, 
	that is, even women belonging to <i>Brahmin</i>, <i>Kshatriya</i> and <i>
	Vaishya</i> <i>varna</i> are not entitled to <i>upanayan</i> and the study 
	of the Vedas. For them, marriage is equivalent to <i>upanayan</i> and 
	service of their husbands is equivalent to the study of the Vedas in the <i>
	gurukul</i>.<a name="fnB37" href="#fn37">[37]</a> Even if the husband is 
	morally degraded, engaged in an affair with another woman and is devoid of 
	knowledge and other qualities, the wife must treat him like a god.
	<a name="fnB38" href="#fn38">[38]</a> A widower is allowed to remarry but a 
	widow is not. <a name="fnB39" href="#fn39">[39]</a> Besides, women are not 
	considered fit for being free and independent. They are to be protected in 
	their childhood by father, in youth by husband and in old age by son.
	<a name="fnB40" href="#fn40">[40]</a> They should never be allowed by their 
	guardians to act independently. <a name="fnB41" href="#fn41">[41]</a> A 
	woman must never do anything even inside her home without the consent of her 
	father, husband and son respectively. <a name="fnB42" href="#fn42">[42]</a> 
	She must remain in control of her father in childhood, of husband in youth 
	and of son after the death of her husband. <a name="fnB43" href="#fn43">[43]</a>
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">5. Treating different <i>varnas</i> 
	as unequal for legal purposes. The Hindu law as codified by Manu is based on 
	the principle of inequality. The punishment for a particular crime is not 
	same for all <i>varnas</i>. In fact, the punishment varies depending on the
	<i>varna</i> of the victim as well as the <i>varna </i>of the person 
	committing the crime. For the same crime, the <i>Brahmin </i>is to be given 
	a mild punishment, whereas the <i>Shudra </i>is to given the harshest 
	punishment of all. Similarly, if the victim of a crime is a <i>Shudra</i>, 
	the punishment is mild, and the punishment is harsh in case the victim is a
	<i>Brahmin</i>. For example, if a <i>Brahmin</i> is awarded death sentence, 
	it is sufficient to shave his head, but <i>Kshatriya</i>, Vaishya and <i>
	Shudra</i> are to actually die. <a name="fnB44" href="#fn44">[44]</a> If a
	<i>Kshatriya</i>, a Vaishya, or a <i>Shudra</i> repeatedly gives false 
	evidence in the court, he is to be punished and expelled from the kingdom, 
	whereas the <i>Brahmin</i> is not to be punished, he is to be only expelled.
	<a name="fnB45" href="#fn45">[45]</a> If a person has sexual intercourse 
	with a consenting women of his own <i>varna</i>, he is not to be punished.
	<a name="fnB46" href="#fn46">[46]</a> But if a person of lower <i>varna</i> 
	has sexual intercourse with a woman of higher <i>varna</i>, with or without 
	her consent, he is to be killed. <a name="fnB47" href="#fn47">[47]</a> If a
	<i>Brahmin</i> forces a <i>dwija</i> to work for him, he is to be punished.
	<a name="fnB48" href="#fn48">[48]</a> But if a <i>Brahmin</i> forces a <i>
	Shudra</i> to work for him, whether by making or not making payments to him, 
	he is not to be punished, because <i>Shudras</i> have been created only for 
	serving <i>Brahmins</i>.<a name="fnB49" href="#fn49">[49]</a> If a <i>
	Brahmin </i>abuses a <i>Shudra</i>, he is to be fined mildly,
	<a name="fnB50" href="#fn50">[50]</a> but if a <i>Shudra</i> abuses a <i>
	Brahmin</i>, he is to be killed. <a name="fnB51" href="#fn51">[51]</a> On 
	the other hand, even if a <i>Brahmin</i> kills a <i>Shudra</i>, he is merely 
	to perform penance by killing a cat, frog, owl or crow, etc.
	<a name="fnB52" href="#fn52">[52]</a> Thus a <i>Shudra</i> is to be killed 
	for abusing a <i>Brahmin</i>, whereas a <i>Brahmin</i> is to be let off 
	lightly even if he kills a <i>Shudra</i>. Such is the unequal justice of <i>
	Manusmriti.</i> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In fact, this system of graded 
	inequality seems to be the very essence of the <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. 
	Whether it is the choice of names, <a name="fnB53" href="#fn53">[53]</a> or 
	the manner of greeting, <a name="fnB54" href="#fn54">[54]</a> or the mode of 
	entertaining guests, <a name="fnB55" href="#fn55">[55]</a> or the method of 
	administering oath in the court, <a name="fnB56" href="#fn56">[56]</a> or 
	the process of taking out the funeral procession,
	<a name="fnB57" href="#fn57">[57]</a> at each and every step in life, from 
	birth to death, this system of graded inequality is to be applied and 
	observed. Manu does not even spare the rates of interest on loan. For 
	borrowing the same amount, <i>Kshatriya</i> has to pay more as interest than
	<i>Brahmin</i>, <i>Vaishya </i>more than <i>Kshatriya </i>and the poor <i>
	Shudra</i> has to pay the maximum amount as interest!
	<a name="fnB58" href="#fn58">[58]</a> </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">6. Prohibiting inter-marriage 
	between different <i>varnas</i>. According to <i>Manusmriti</i>, a <i>dwija</i> 
	ought to marry a woman of his own <i>varna</i>.<a name="fnB59" href="#fn59">[59]</a> 
	A woman of the same <i>varna</i> is considered best for the first marriage. 
	However, a <i>dwija</i> may take a woman of inferior <i>varna</i> as his 
	second wife if he is overcome by sexual passion.
	<a name="fnB60" href="#fn60">[60]</a> &nbsp; But Manu strongly disapproves of <i>
	Brahmins</i> and <i>Kshatriyas</i> taking a <i>Shudra </i>woman even as 
	their second wife. They become <i>Shudra</i> if they do so.
	<a name="fnB61" href="#fn61">[61]</a><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
	<dl>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">7. Supporting untouchability is 
		also a part of the scheme of social stratification outlined in the <i>
		Manusmriti</i>. Manu clearly mentions that <i>Brahmin</i>, <i>Kshatriya</i> 
		and <i>Vaishya</i>, collectively known as <i>dwija</i> and the <i>
		Shudras</i> are the four <i>varnas</i>. There is no fifth <i>varna</i>.<a name="fnB62" href="#fn62">[62]</a> 
		He explains the origin of other castes by saying that they are <i>
		varna-sankara</i> castes, that is to say, castes originating due to the 
		intermixture of different <i>varnas</i>, both in <i>anuloma</i> (upper
		<i>varna </i>male and lower <i>varna</i> female) and <i>pratiloma </i>
		(lower <i>varna </i>male and upper <i>varna </i>female) manner.
		<a name="fnB63" href="#fn63">[63]</a> For example, <i>Nishad </i>caste 
		is said to have originated from <i>anuloma</i> relationship between <i>
		Brahmin</i> male and <i>Shudra </i>female,<a name="fnB64" href="#fn64">[64]</a> 
		whereas C <i>handala</i> caste is said to be owing its origin to <i>
		pratiloma</i> relationship between <i>Shudra</i> male and <i>Brahmin</i> 
		female. <a name="fnB65" href="#fn65">[65]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Manu seems to be disapproving of
		<i>pratiloma </i>relationship more than the <i>anuloma</i>, because he 
		describes C<i>handalas</i> as the lowest of the low castes.
		<a name="fnB66" href="#fn66">[66]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us see what <i>Manusmriti</i>, 
		has to say about the C <i>handala</i>. The <i>Chandala</i>, says <i>
		Manusmriti</i>, must not ever reside inside the village. While doing 
		their work, they must reside outside the village, at cremation ground, 
		on mountains or in groves. They are not entitled to keep cows or horses, 
		etc., as pet animals. They may keep dogs and donkeys. They are to wear 
		shrouds. They are to eat in broken utensils. They are to use ornaments 
		of iron, not of gold. They must keep moving from one place to another, 
		not residing at the same place for a long duration.
		<a name="fnB67" href="#fn67">[67]</a> They must not move around in 
		villages and cities in night hours. They may enter the villages and 
		cities in daytime, with king's permission, wearing special symbols (to 
		enable identification), and take away unclaimed dead bodies.
		<a name="fnB68" href="#fn68">[68]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Moreover, how is the &quot;religious&quot; 
		person to deal with the <i>Chandala</i>? He must not have any social 
		intercourse (marriage, interdining, etc.) with them. He must not talk to 
		or even see them! <a name="fnB69" href="#fn69">[69]</a> He may ask 
		servants (apparently <i>Shudras</i>) to give them food in broken 
		utensils. <a name="fnB70" href="#fn70">[70]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">8. Granting divine and religious 
		sanction to <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. Manu gives divine and religious 
		sanction to the <i>varna-vyavastha</i> by claiming divine origin for the
		<i>varnas</i> as well as for the <i>Manusmriti </i>and demanding 
		unquestioning obedience of it. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, that completes my exposition 
		of the <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. I want to emphasize in particular that my 
		exposition does not contain any exaggeration at all. The reader may 
		check each and every statement by comparing with the original <i>
		Manusmriti</i> in order to satisfy himself or herself. I cannot help if 
		the system is so unjust and so out of tune with out existing values that 
		even an objective exposition reads like a severe condemnation. 
		Nevertheless, I will now turn to my reasons for rejecting <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i>: I reject <i>varna-vyavastha</i> because it is 
		irrational, unjust and undemocratic, being opposed to the democratic and 
		human values of liberty, equality and fraternity. </font></p>
		<b>
		<h3 align="justify"></b><font face="Verdana">Criticism of 
		varna-vyavastha </font></h3>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The <i>varna-vyavastha</i> is 
		opposed to the value of liberty as it denies the freedom to choose one's 
		occupation and marriage partner to one and all. Everyone must join the 
		occupation of his <i>varna</i> and must marry within his <i>varna</i>. 
		Similarly, it denies the freedom to study to the <i>Shudras</i> and 
		woman in particular. Even the <i>dwija </i>must study the Vedas before 
		he studies anything else. Otherwise, he becomes a <i>Shudra.</i><a name="fnB71" href="#fn71">[71]</a> 
		(Incidentally, according to <i>Manusmriti</i>, there are several ways by 
		which a <i>Brahmin</i> or <i>dwija</i> may become a <i>Shudra</i> but 
		there is no way by which a <i>Shudra</i> may become a <i>Brahmin</i>. A
		<i>Shudra </i>must always remain a <i>Shudra.</i>)<a name="fnB72" href="#fn72">[72]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is worse, the <i>Chandala
		</i>is even denied the freedom to reside at a place of his choice or to 
		wear clothes and ornaments of his choice. He is not even free to keep 
		pet animals of his choice. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The conflict between <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i> and the value of equality is more than obvious. As I 
		mentioned earlier, the system of graded inequality seems to be the very 
		essence of <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. It denies equal respect to all in 
		society. It denies equality before law. It denies equal access to 
		marriage partners. It denies equal access to jobs. The occupation of 
		teachers and priests, for example, is reserved exclusively for <i>
		Brahmins</i>. Finally, it also denies equal access to education and 
		knowledge. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A <i>Brahmin</i>, according to 
		Manu, must not teach the <i>Shudra</i> and woman even if he dies with 
		his knowledge without imparting it to anybody.
		<a name="fnB73" href="#fn73">[73]</a> On the other hand, if anyone 
		studies the Vedas on his own he or she will go straight to hell.
		<a name="fnB74" href="#fn74">[74]</a> In other words, cent percent 
		reservations for <i>dwija </i>males in the sphere of education. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The <i>varna-vyavastha</i> is 
		most unfair to the <i>Shudras </i>and the untouchables. They are denied 
		respect, knowledge, power and wealth. They are denied access to 
		occupations considered respectable, just as they are denied access to 
		men and women of upper <i>varnas </i>for marriage. The <i>Shudras</i> 
		are virtually reduced to being slaves of the <i>Brahmins</i> in 
		particular and the <i>dwijas</i> in general, whereas the untouchables 
		are regarded as outcast -- beyond the pale of the society. The women are 
		generally treated as sexual objects and as unfit for being independent 
		and free. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As far as fraternity is 
		considered, we must not expect it to exist in a society, which is so 
		unequal and unjust. A <i>Shudra's</i> waist is to be branded or his 
		buttocks are to be cut only because he occupies the same seat as the <i>
		Brahmin</i>. The &quot;religious&quot; are not to talk or even look at a <i>
		Chandala</i>. Inter-marriage is prohibited. Manu seems to be most eager 
		to prevent inter-mixing of the <i>varnas.</i> Thus, the Hindu social 
		order is based on the isolation and exclusiveness of the <i>varnas</i>.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The <i>Manusmriti</i> not only 
		outlines a totally undemocratic and unjust social system but also gives 
		divine, religious sanction to this man-made social institution of <i>
		chaturvarnya</i>. Some Hindus, including apparently learned &quot;thinkers&quot; 
		and writers, smugly wax eloquent about Hinduism being the most tolerant 
		and liberal religion of the world. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is there any other religion, 
		which sanctions slavery and untouchability? Is there any other religion 
		in which only persons born in a particular caste ( <i>Brahmin</i>) are 
		entitled to become priests? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Slavery is not peculiar to India 
		or to Hinduism, but carrying it to the extremes of untouchability, and 
		granting it divine and religious sanction is peculiar to Hinduism.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Similarly, some Hindus may be 
		tolerant, just as some of them are intolerant, but Hinduism or Hindu 
		religion is not tolerant at all, either socially or intellectually. <i>
		Manusmriti</i>, for example, clearly says that anybody who argues 
		critically and logically about <i>dharmashastras</i> ought to be 
		ostracized. <a name="fnB75" href="#fn75">[75]</a> Non-believers, 
		including freethinkers, rationalists and Buddhists, are not to be 
		entertained respectfully as guests; though, mercifully, they may be 
		given food. <a name="fnB76" href="#fn76">[76]</a> The families of 
		non-believers are destroyed sooner than later according to Manu.
		<a name="fnB77" href="#fn77">[77]</a> A state with a large number of <i>
		Shudra</i>s and <i>nastikas</i> soon meets its destruction.
		<a name="fnB78" href="#fn78">[78]</a> <i>Manusmriti</i> is full of 
		abusive epithets for freethinkers and non-believers. The unorthodox ( <i>
		nastikas</i>) are sometimes equated with the <i>Shudras</i>, sometimes 
		with the <i>Chandalas</i>, sometimes with thieves and sometimes with 
		lunatics! <a name="fnB79" href="#fn79">[79]</a> Such is the generosity 
		of Hindu <i>dharma</i>. </font></p>
		<b>
		<h3 align="justify"></b><font face="Verdana">Apologies for 
		varna-vyavastha </font></h3>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let me now consider what the 
		apologists of <i>varna-vyavastha</i> have to say in its defense. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A standard defense of <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i> is to say that it is a system of division of labor. 
		It is easy to grant that division of labor is essential for any complex 
		society, but it is equally easy to see that <i>varna-vyavastha</i> is 
		not a system of division of labor based on aptitude and capability. It 
		is a system of division of labor <b>based on birth </b>. Besides, it has 
		other associated features such as feeling of superiority and 
		inferiority, inequality before law, denial of equal access to knowledge 
		and prohibition against inter-marriage. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What have these features to do 
		with the division of labor? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Division of labor is found in 
		all societies, but <i>varna-vyavastha</i> is not. Thus, trying to 
		justify <i>varna-vyavastha</i> as division of labor is a futile 
		exercise. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another standard defense of the
		<i>varna-vyavastha</i> is to say that the system was originally based on 
		aptitude and capability. Whether it was actually ever so is a subject 
		for historical research. Most probably, the racial theory of the origin 
		of castes is true. However, even if we grant for the sake of argument 
		that the <i>varna-vyavastha</i> was originally based on aptitude and 
		capability, how does it help? We cannot say that <b>because</b> the 
		system was originally, some time in remote past, based on aptitude and 
		capability; <b>therefore</b> we ought to gladly suffer the present 
		system based on birth. It hardly makes any sense at all! </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In any case, <i>Manusmriti </i>
		was most probably written between200 BC and 200 AD
		<a name="fnB80" href="#fn80">[80]</a> and the system as outlined in it 
		is totally based on birth. Gautam Buddha, who lived in sixth century BC, 
		challenged the infallibility of the Vedas as well as the <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i>. There are several passages in <i>Tripitaka</i>, 
		mainly in <i>Digha Nikaya </i>and <i>Majhima Nikaya </i>which are 
		&quot;directed against the claims of the Brahmans to be of different origin 
		from the rest of humanity, born from the mouth of Brahma, having a 
		hereditary prerogative to teach, guide and spiritually govern the rest 
		of the society.&quot; <a name="fnB81" href="#fn81">[81]</a> In <i>Majhima 
		Nikaya </i>Buddha is quoted as refuting <i>varna-vyavastha</i> on 
		several occasions. According to Buddha, it is unreasonable to decide 
		one's place and functions in society on the basis of one's birth in a 
		caste. Buddha is also quoted as insisting that in the eyes of the law 
		all persons ought to be treated as equal, irrespective of the caste or
		<i>varna </i>in which he or she is born. <a name="fnB82" href="#fn82">
		[82]</a> Thus, it is obvious that even if the system of <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i> ever existed in its ideal form -- which is doubtful 
		-- it had already degenerated by the time of Buddha, that is, about 2500 
		years back. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most blatant defense of <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i>, however, is to say that human beings are born 
		unequal, and, therefore, it is natural and normal for children to join 
		the occupation of their fathers. Surprisingly and sadly, no less a 
		person than Gandhi defended <i>varna-vyavastha</i> in a similar manner.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To quote Gandhi: &quot;I believe that 
		every man is born in the world with certain natural tendencies. Every 
		person is born with certain definite limitations which he cannot 
		overcome. From a careful observation of those limitations the law of <i>
		varna</i> was deduced. It establishes certain spheres of action for 
		certain people with certain tendencies. This avoided all unworthy 
		competition. Whilst recognizing limitations, the law of <i>varna </i>
		admitted of no distinction of high and low; on the one hand it 
		guaranteed to each the fruits of his labors and on the other it 
		prevented him from pressing upon his neighbor. This great law has been 
		degraded and fallen into disrepute. But my conviction is that an ideal 
		social order will only be evolved when the implications of this law are 
		fully understood and given effect to&quot;. <a name="fnB83" href="#fn83">[83]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Again, &quot;I regard <i>Varnashrama</i> 
		as a healthy division of work based on birth. The present ideas of caste 
		are a perversion of the original. There is no question with me of 
		superiority or inferiority. It is purely a question of duty. I have 
		indeed stated that <i>varna </i>is based on birth. But I have also said 
		that it is possible for a <i>shudra</i>, for instance, to become a <i>
		vaishya.</i> But in order to perform the <i>duty </i>of <i>vaishya</i> 
		he does not need the label of a <i>vaishya.</i> He who performs the duty 
		of a <i>brahman</i> will easily become one in the next incarnation.&quot;
		<a name="fnB84" href="#fn84">[84]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">So, <i>varna-vyavastha</i>, 
		according to Gandhi, is a &quot;healthy division of work based on birth&quot;, 
		which takes into account the &quot;natural tendencies&quot; of human beings and 
		avoids &quot;unworthy competition.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This apparently plausible 
		defense of <i>varna-vyavastha</i> is, in fact, most unscientific. It is 
		a well-known and scientifically verified fact that <b>acquired </b>
		characteristics are not inherited biologically, only genetic qualities 
		are transmitted from one generation to another. For instance, carpentry 
		is an acquired characteristic; just as knowledge of philosophy is an 
		acquired quality. Neither a carpenter's son or daughter is born with the 
		knowledge of carpentry, nor is a philosopher's daughter or son born with 
		the knowledge of philosophy. These are acquired characteristics and, 
		therefore, they cannot be inherited biologically. If sometimes, though 
		not always, a carpenter's son becomes a good carpenter or a 
		philosopher's daughter acquires a good knowledge of philosophy, without 
		being formally initiated into these disciplines, it is <b>not because 
		they are born with the required knowledge, but only because of the 
		favorable environment at home, </b>which enables them to acquire these 
		characteristics. The result could be different if their places were to 
		be interchanged. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One may say that though the 
		knowledge of carpentry of philosophy in not inherited biologically, the 
		mental qualities enabling one to acquire the requisite knowledge is 
		inherited. Some physical and mental qualities are, no doubt, inherited 
		but this does not mean that parents and their children are always 
		identical in physical or mental qualities. It is a well known fact -- 
		anybody can verify this by careful observation -- that due to different 
		permutations and combinations of chromosomes and genes offspring of same 
		parents are not always identical to one another or to their parents. 
		More often than not, they are different. For instance, one son or 
		daughter of same parents may be tall and another short. The colors of 
		skin, hair and eyes may differ likewise. What is true of physical 
		characteristics is equally true of mental qualities. Thus, a child may 
		or may not have the mental characteristics, which his father has. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Therefore, <b>it is totally 
		unscientific to forcefully restrict children to the occupations of their 
		forefathers. </b></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is true that all human beings 
		are not equal in the sense of being <b>identical </b>in physical or 
		mental qualities. But it does not follow from this that they ought to be 
		denied equal opportunity to join a vocation of their choice or that they 
		ought to be denied equality before law or equal respect as human beings 
		in the society. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As for &quot;unworthy&quot; competition, 
		how do we know that the competition is unworthy unless all are, to begin 
		with, given equal opportunity? Take the example of Gandhi himself. He 
		was a <i>bania</i> by caste. Yet, in spite of some serious aberrations 
		such as supporting <i>varna-vyavastha</i> based on birth and linking 
		politics with religion, he performed fairly well in the role of a 
		national leader. It would have been a great loss for the nation if in 
		the name of avoiding &quot;unworthy&quot; competition in politics, Gandhi would 
		have been confined to running a grocery shop. Similarly, Dr. B.R. 
		Ambedkar was born in an &quot;untouchable&quot; caste, but he played an important 
		role in the drafting of the democratic constitution of independent 
		India. He also taught in a college for some time. To use the terminology 
		of <i>varna-vyavastha</i>, he ably performed the work of a <i>Brahmin.</i>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Is it possible to imagine how 
		many Ambedkars we may have lost by now owing to the restrictive <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i>? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">As we have noted earlier, <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i> is a closed system of social stratification without 
		any scope for upward social mobility. To quote M. Haralambos, author of 
		a textbook on sociology, &quot;A person belongs to his parents jati and 
		automatically follows the occupation of the <i>jati </i>into which he 
		was born. Thus no matter what the biologically based aptitude and 
		capacities of an untouchable, there is no way he can become a Brahmin. 
		Unless it is assumed that superior genes are permanently located in the 
		Brahmin caste, and there is no evidence that this is the case, then 
		there is probably no relationship between genetically based and socially 
		created inequality in traditional Hindu society.&quot;
		<a name="fnB85" href="#fn85">[85]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Returning to Gandhi, though 
		Gandhi was opposed to untouchability and caste, he did not carry his 
		opposition to its logical conclusion. Inconsistently enough, he 
		continued to support the <i>varna-vyavastha</i> based on birth. At one 
		stage, he even supported restrictions on interdining and intermarriage. 
		As he wrote in <em>Young India</em> in 1921, &quot;Hinduism does most 
		emphatically discourage interdining and intermarriage between 
		divisions... It is no part of a Hindu's duty to dine with his son. And 
		by restricting his choice of bride to a particular group, he exercises 
		rare self-restraint. <b>Prohibition against intermarriages and 
		interdining is essential for the rapid evolution of the soul. </b>&quot;<a name="fnB86" href="#fn86">[86]</a> 
		(emphasis mine) </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Later Gandhi moved away from 
		these orthodox ideas, and started supporting intercaste marriages. 
		Finally in 1946, he refused to solemnize any marriage at Sevagram Ashram 
		unless one of the parties was an untouchable.
		<a name="fnB87" href="#fn87">[87]</a> May be he would also have given up
		<i>varna-vyavastha</i> if he had lived longer. That, however, is in the 
		realm of imagination, the fact is that Gandhi supported <i>
		varna-vyavastha</i>. It is worth noting that he invented his own 
		conception of <i>varna-vyavastha</i>, which, according to him, had 
		nothing to do with the feeling of superiority and inferiority or with 
		prohibition against intermarriage. We find here in Gandhi a quaint 
		mixture of conservatism and reformism. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I would like to dispose of one 
		last objection before concluding this section. One may say that the 
		Hindu law at present is quite different from what Manu desired, and 
		presently Hindus in general do not follow Manu in totality. This is 
		true. The Hindu law at present, for instance, allows inter-caste 
		marriage and prohibits bigamy and child marriage. It permits divorce. It 
		also allows widow remarriage and grants equal rights to daughters in 
		father's property. Nevertheless, there seems to be a gap between the 
		progressive Hindu law and the conservative social practices of the 
		Hindus. A majority of Hindu marriages are still within the caste and 
		very few Hindu women actually claim or get a share in father's property.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Indian constitution has 
		rightly made special provisions, such as reservations in services for 
		scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other socially and educationally 
		backward classes, to enable them to enter occupations and positions of 
		power, which had been traditionally denied to them. No doubt, some upper 
		caste liberal Hindus, too, support the policy of reservation. But, by 
		and large, the Hindu upper castes are far from fully reconciled to this 
		progressive step as is evident from violent and aggressive 
		anti-reservation agitation spearheaded by upper caste students from time 
		to time. This kind of reactionary agitation aimed at preserving the 
		present dominance of upper castes in education and the services enjoys 
		considerable support and sympathy in the upper caste dominated media as 
		well as the academia. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the whole, the Hindu society 
		is yet to fully exorcise the ghost of Manu. Caste based on birth and 
		untouchability still exist in the Hindu society, in spite of the fact 
		that untouchability has been abolished by the Indian constitution. The 
		distribution of education, power and wealth continues to be uneven in 
		the Hindu society, with the <i>dwijas </i>being on the top and the <i>
		Shudras</i> and untouchables being at the bottom. Teaching is no more an 
		exclusive preserve of <i>Brahmins</i>, but the occupation of Hindu 
		priests is still fully reserved for <i>Brahmins</i>, though this fact 
		does not arouse the ire of our fervent anti-reservationists. </font></p>
		<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>Moksha</i>, <i>Karmavada</i> 
		and <i>Avatarvada</i></font></h3>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><i>Moksha </i>is traditionally 
		regarded as the highest end of life in Hindu religion. The &quot;endless 
		cycle of birth and death&quot; is considered a bondage from which one must 
		attain liberation, that is <i>moksha</i> or <i>mukti</i>. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This whole concept of bondage 
		and liberation is based on the unproved assumption of life after death, 
		and the existence of soul ( <i>atma</i>) which continues to exist apart 
		from the body even after death. In the famous words of <i>Gita</i>, the 
		soul changes bodies just as human beings change clothes.
		<a name="fnB88" href="#fn88">[88]</a> </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, there are no good reasons 
		for believing in the existence of soul or life after death or rebirth. 
		These beliefs are not at all supported by incontrovertible scientific 
		evidence. According to S.N. Dasgupta, &quot;there has seldom been before or 
		after Buddha any serious attempt to prove or disprove the doctrine of 
		rebirth. The attempts to prove the doctrine of rebirth in the Hindu 
		philosophical works such as Nyaya, etc. are slight and inadequate.&quot;
		<a name="fnB89" href="#fn89">[89]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, even before Buddha, 
		Lokayat had disproved the existence of soul, life after death, rebirth, 
		heaven and hell on an empirical basis, as these things are never 
		perceived. <a name="fnB90" href="#fn90">[90]</a></font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thus, in absence of any evidence 
		to the contrary, it is reasonable to believe that <b>each one of us has 
		got one and only one life </b>. Once a person is dead, he is dead for 
		ever. Never to be reborn. <b>Mind, consciousness, memory and life cannot 
		outlast the destruction of brain and body. </b>This is the harsh truth; 
		howsoever we may dislike it. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The belief in soul seems to have 
		originated from primitive animism. <a name="fnB91" href="#fn91">[91]</a> 
		If this belief continues to persist, in spite of total lack of evidence 
		in its support, it is only because of human beings' inability to come to 
		terms with, or to squarely face, the reality of death. One likes to 
		believe that one's near and dear ones, who are dead and finished 
		forever, actually continue to live in some other imaginary world, and 
		that they will also be reborn one day. One draws comfort from the 
		thought that one will not die even after death, and continue to live in 
		some other form. It is paradoxical that, first, the fear of death and 
		love of life makes one readily accept the belief in the immortality and 
		rebirth of soul without adequate evidence, and, then, getting rid of 
		this alleged cycle of birth and death itself becomes the topmost 
		religious aim! <a name="fnB92" href="#fn92">[92]</a> </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The problem of getting 
		&quot;released&quot; from the alleged cycle of birth and death is a pseudo-problem 
		(in the sense that one is trying to get rid of something which simply 
		does not exist) and <i>moksha</i> is an imaginary ideal which has 
		nothing to do with the reality. Instead of running after the imaginary 
		ideal of <i>moksha</i>, it is far better to concentrate on improving and 
		living well this one and only life, which we have. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mimamsa, which is an orthodox 
		Hindu school of thought, considers attainment of heaven ( <i>swarga</i>), 
		instead of <i>moksha</i>, as the highest end of life. References to 
		heaven and hell are also to be found in the <i>Manusmriti</i>. The 
		belief in heaven is fairly widespread at popular level. However, the 
		ideal of the attainment of heaven, too, is based on unproved 
		assumptions, like life after death and the existence of heaven, and, 
		therefore, it cannot be accepted. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Another related doctrine is the 
		Hindu belief in <i>karmavada</i> or the so-called law of <i>karma</i>. 
		According to this doctrine, every human being gets the fruits of his 
		actions either in the present or in some future life. Whatever a human 
		being is in his present life is the result of his own actions in the 
		past life or lives. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This, again, is a totally 
		unverified and unverifiable doctrine based on the assumption of the 
		&quot;cycle of birth and death&quot;. It is only a convenient tool for explaining 
		away the perceived inequality in human society. The idea of <i>karma</i> 
		is found in Buddhism and Jainism as well. However, these religions do 
		not support <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. But in Hinduism the doctrine of <i>
		karma</i>, along with the idea of god, has been used for providing 
		ideological support to the unjust <i>varna-vyavastha</i> and for making 
		it appear just and fair. In Hinduism the so-called law of <i>karma </i>
		merely serves the purpose of legitimizing the unjust <i>varna-vyavastha</i> 
		by making the <i>Shudras</i> and the &quot;untouchables&quot; meekly accept their 
		degrading position as a &quot;result of their own deeds&quot; in imaginary past 
		lives, and by assuring them &quot;better&quot; birth in &quot;next life&quot; if they 
		faithfully perform their <i>varna-dharma</i> in their present lives.
		<a name="fnB93" href="#fn93">[93]</a> In this way, this doctrine 
		prevents them from revolting against this man-made undemocratic system, 
		which has nothing to do with alleged past and future lives. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Lastly, I come to the Hindu 
		doctrine of <i>avatarvada</i>. According to this doctrine, whenever 
		religion is threatened in this world, god takes birth as an <i>avatar
		</i>to put things back into order. Ram and Krishna, for example, are 
		popularly regarded as <i>avatars</i> by the Hindus. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Belief in <i>avatarvada</i>, 
		too, is logically unjustifiable and merely makes one run away from one's 
		own responsibilities. Instead of making efforts to improve their own 
		condition, those who believe in <i>avatarvada</i> keep waiting for an <i>
		avatar</i> to take birth. Since god does not exist, there is no question 
		of his being born on this earth as an <i>avatar</i>. (Let me add here 
		that I also do not believe in the truth of statements like &quot;Jesus is the 
		son of god&quot; or &quot;Mohammed is the messenger of god&quot;.) </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Not only I do not regard Ram or 
		Krishna (or anyone else) as an <i>avatar </i>of god, I also do not 
		regard them as ideal personalities. Ram, as mentioned earlier, was on 
		upholder, of the <i>varna-vyavastha</i>. His cruel behavior with Sita, 
		after fighting a destructive war with Ravana to get her released, is too 
		well known to need recapitulation. <a name="fnB94" href="#fn94">[94]</a>
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Krishna, on the other hand, is 
		portrayed in the <i>Mahabharata </i>as the teacher of <i>Bhagvat Gita
		</i>, a book which expounds untrue and harmful doctrines like the belief 
		in god and immortal soul, <i>avatarvada</i>, <i>karmavada</i>, <i>
		varnashram dharma </i>and the doctrine of <i>moksha.</i> </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In <i>Mahabharata</i> Krishna 
		adopts and advocates adoption of unfair means like lying and deception 
		for achieving one's ends. Obviously, he did not believe in the doctrine 
		of purity of ends and means. There are several flaws in the character of 
		Krishna as portrayed in the <i>Mahabharata</i>, <i>Bhagvat</i> and <i>
		Harivamsa</i>. These have been ably enumerated by Dr. Ambedkar in his <i>
		The Riddle of Ram and Krishna </i>. I refer the interested reader to 
		this work for a fuller treatment of this subject.
		<a name="fnB95" href="#fn95">[95]</a> </font></p>
		<h3 align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Conclusion</font></h3>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">To conclude, I categorically 
		reject major Hindu religious beliefs including the doctrine of the 
		infallibility of the Vedas, <i>varnashram dharma </i>, <i>moksha</i>, <i>
		karmavada</i>, and <i>avatarvada</i>. I am not an admirer of Ram and 
		Krishna, and I also do not believe in idol worship or the Hindu taboo of 
		not eating beef. I support logical and scientific thinking; and a 
		secular, rational morality based on human values of liberty, equality 
		and fraternity. Therefore, I am not a Hindu by conviction, though I am a 
		Hindu by birth. </font></p>
