	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How do we see Galileo, Newton, 
	Einstein and Tagore as politicians or did they ever engaged, took side or 
	participated in any politics in its real term? Well, their political lives 
	though were not that luminous, the answer is yes and they surely did not 
	come off with flying colors as they did in their other fields of 
	international prides and fames. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">For example, Einstein's life was 
	&quot;divided between politics and equations&quot; and most of us knew his politics of 
	nuclear bomb as well as his famous letter to President Franklin Roosevelt. 
	Einstein's political activities started during First World War when he was a 
	professor in Berlin and was sickened by what he saw as waste of human lives, 
	became involved in anti-war demonstration. His post war efforts to prevent 
	nuclear war are also well known. His advocacy of civil disobedience and post 
	war international reconciliation efforts did not make him any popular and 
	actually his politics later were making it difficult for him to visit/enter 
	US, even to give lectures. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">His second great cause was Zionism. 
	Though he was Jewish by decent, Einstein rejected the biblical idea of God. 
	However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism during and after the First 
	World War made him an outspoken supporter of Jewish Community. His &quot;mind's 
	free speech&quot; on his theories also came under attack; an anti-Einstein 
	organization was even set to repudiate and assault him. At one point, a man 
	was convicted of inciting others to murder Einstein that ended up with $6 
	(six dollars) fine! In 1933, Hitler came to power and Einstein was in 
	America and decided not to return to Germany. His efforts towards peace 
	achieved little except only few friends. However he was duly recognized in 
	1952 for his support for Jewish cause and was offered Presidency of Israel. 
	He declined it, perhaps; equations were more important to him, knowing very 
	well that &quot;Politics is for the present but an equation is something for 
	eternity&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Background: The Indian Independence 
	Movement was a series of revolutions empowered by the people of India put 
	forth to battle the British Empire to a complete political independence. It 
	began with many organizations like the &quot;Sepoy Mutiny or Rebellion&quot; of 1857, 
	reaching its climax with Indian National Congress, All India Muslim League, 
	Mahatma Gandhi's Quit India Movement (1942-1945) and Subash Chandra Bose's 
	Indian National Army invasion of British India during World War II and 
	culminating eventually in full freedom on August14/15, 1947. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Kabi Guru Rabindranath Tagore was 
	not deeply or visibly involved in any Party politics but never detached 
	himself from maneuvering actively with current political events either. His 
	political views marked complexities to characterize when he joined &quot;Swadeshi 
	Movement&quot; in 1906 with the Indian National Congress, a Hindu-dominated 
	political organization supported by the Calcutta elite against Lord Curzon. 
	He strongly voiced against the partition of United Bengal and fiercely and 
	forcefully opposed the division of Bengal in his essay published in 
	&quot;Bangadarshan&quot;. All India Muslim League supported Lord Curzon for historical 
	reason and voiced against &quot;Swadeshi Movement&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore was uniquely complex in his 
	attitude towards nationalism. He inaugurated the meeting of the Congress 
	party that took place in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1896 by singing &quot;Bande 
	Mataram&quot; to his own tune. He composed his celebrated piece &quot;Shivaji's Utsav&quot; 
	at that time and was inspired by the Shivaji Festival introduced by 
	Maharashtra's Balgangadhar Tilak. In his many articles like &quot;Sadhana&quot;, 
	&quot;Bangadarshan&quot;, and &quot;Bharati&quot;, he passed many intransigent opinions and 
	views on many contemporary political situations. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In 1925 he stated that British 
	imperialism was not a primary evil but only a political symptom of our 
	social disease. He urged Indians to accept that &quot;there can be no question of 
	blind revolution, but of steady and purposeful education&quot;. Such views 
	inevitably enraged many, placing his life in danger. During his stay in a 
	San Francisco hotel in late 1916, Tagore narrowly escaped an assassination 
	attempt by Indian expatriates; the plot failed only because the would-be 
	assassins fell into an argument. Yet Tagore wrote songs lionizing the Indian 
	Independence Movement and renounced his knighthood in protest against the 
	Jallianwala Bagh massacre in13 April 1919. Tagore was also the key in 
	resolving a Gandhi-B.R.Ambedkar dispute involving separate electorates for 
	untouchables. Though Tagore wrote for the movement of self-rule, he never 
	supported extreme nationalism or terrorist activities and had disputed 
	admirations for Netaji Subash Chandra Bose as a leader of Indian 
	Independence. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Gandhi and Tagore severely clashed 
	over their totally different attitudes toward political philosophy, culture 
	and science. In January 1934, Bihar was struck by a devastating earthquake 
	that killed thousands of people. Gandhi was then deeply involved in the 
	fight against &quot;untouchability&quot;; and extracted a positive lesson from that 
	tragic event. He argued, &quot;A man like me cannot but believe this earthquake 
	is a divine chastisement sent by God for our sins; in particular the sins of 
	untouchability. For me there is a vital connection between the Bihar 
	calamity and the untouchability campaign&quot;. Tagore equally abhorred 
	untouchability and had joined Gandhi in the movements against it, but 
	fulminated against Gandhi's interpretation of this event that had caused 
	suffering and death to so many innocent people including children and 
	babies. He also hated the epistemology implicit in seeing an earthquake as 
	caused by ethical failure. He wrote &quot;It is all the more unfortunate because 
	this kind of unscientific view of natural phenomena is too readily accepted 
	by a large section of our countrymen&quot;. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore was predictably hostile to 
	communal sectarianism, such as a Hindu orthodoxy that was antagonistic to 
	Islamic, Christian, or Sikh perspectives. Even nationalism seemed to be a 
	suspect to him because of his attitude toward traditional Indian culture 
	over broad cultural diversity. He wanted Indians to learn what is going on 
	elsewhere, how others lived, what they valued, and so on, while remaining 
	interested and involved in their own culture and heritage. Unlike Gandhi who 
	promoted traditional Indian culture, Tagore was not dismissive to Western 
	civilization. It could be found in his advice to Indian students abroad and 
	in his letters wrote to his son-in-law (1907) Nagendranath Gangulee who had 
	come to USA to study agriculture. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Rabindranath rebelled against the 
	&quot;strongly nationalist form&quot; that the independence movement often took. This 
	approach made him to refrain from taking particular active part in any 
	contemporary politics. He wanted to assert that India's right to be 
	independent without denying the importance of what India could learn freely 
	and profitably from abroad would not compromise traditional Indian culture. 
	Tagore's criticism of patriotism is a persistent theme in his writings. In 
	1908, he expressed his position clearly in a letter replying to the 
	criticism of Abala Bose, the wife of a great Indian scientist, Jagadish 
	Chandra Bose, &quot;Patriotism cannot be our final spiritual shelter; my refuge 
	is humanity. I will not buy glass for the price of diamonds and I will never 
	allow patriotism to triumph over humanity as long as I live&quot;. His novel &quot;Ghare 
	Baire&quot; (The Home and the World) has much to say about this theme. In this 
	novel, Nikhil, who is keen on social reform including women's liberation, 
	but cool toward nationalism, gradually loses the esteem of his spirited 
	wife, Bimala, because of his failure to be enthusiastic about anti-British 
	agitations, which she sees as a lack of patriotic commitment. Bimala becomes 
	fascinated with Nikhil's nationalist friend Sandip, who speaks brilliantly 
	and acts with patriotic militancy and she falls in love with him………. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Tagore also was not invariably 
	well-informed about international politics. He allowed himself to be 
	entertained by Mussolini in a short visit to Italy in May-June 1926. It was 
	arranged by Carlo Formichi, a Professor of Sanskrit at the University of 
	Rome. During that visit Tagore wished to meet Benedetto Croce, an Italian 
	Philosopher/ politician, but Prof. Formichi called it &quot;Impossible&quot;! 
	Mussolini told Tagore that Croce was &quot;not in Rome&quot;. As Tagore continued 
	insisting and said, &quot;I would go wherever he is&quot;. Mussolini then said to him 
	that Croce's whereabouts were unknown!! </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Warnings from Romain Rolland, a 
	French writer and Nobel Prize in literature in 1915 and other friends should 
	have ended Tagore's brief involvement with Mussolini more quickly than it 
	did. But only after he received graphic accounts of the brutality of Italian 
	fascism from two exiles, Gaetano Salvemini and Gaetano Salvadori and learned 
	more of what was happening in Italy. Tagore did publicly denounce the regime 
	and published a letter to the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; in August 1926. The 
	following month &quot;Popolo d'Italia&quot; a magazine edited by Mussolini's brother, 
	replied: &quot;Who cares? Italy laughs at Tagore anyway and also at those who 
	brought this unctuous and insupportable fellow in our midst.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">(Thanks to Prof. Amartya Sen, 
	Swedish Nobel Academy and some periodicals). </font></p>
