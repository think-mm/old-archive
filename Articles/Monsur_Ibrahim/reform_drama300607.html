	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Current government in 
		the beginning showed good hope to people and virtually saved the nation 
		from a mockery of democracy by preventing a one-sided election and 
		possible anarchy. &nbsp;Subsequently some of the actions of this government 
		started raising questions among people. Now, not everyone loves them as 
		before because their actions are not always fair, impartial and/or 
		transparent. It appears more people are scared of the government than 
		they support them from their heart. Let’s have a look on their ‘reform’ 
		agenda.</font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Every sensible, 
		conscious and progressive person is in favor of reform. Question arises 
		when “reform” is being used as a signboard to implement some one’s own 
		plan, desire or hidden agenda. Recently, we are watching a series of 
		‘reform’ drama in Bangladesh. The reform process in practice has no 
		definite layout rather it fluctuates, has no consistency and is being 
		directed and manipulated by ‘undercover’ power. &nbsp;The way this reform 
		process is going simply reminds us of a scene from Kurbani Eid; i.e. few 
		people trying pushing a cow and forcing it down on the ground for 
		slaughtering. Some people try to tie up the legs of the cow and others 
		force it on the ground while the cow struggles to remain on foot and the 
		slaughter-man (butcher/religious person) watches the whole thing from a 
		distance. Once the cow is down and under control, the man comes with a 
		big sharp weapon (knife/sword) and slaughters the cow. Now we can 
		compare the men pushing the cow as the reformer leaders in each party (BNP, 
		AL, JP), people trying to tie the legs of the cow as forces trying to 
		tie up Hasina, Khaleda and Ersahd by isolating them, and the government 
		as the man with the knife/sword – ready to slaughter the party. </font>
	</div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">It is very interesting 
		that some leaders from BNP, AL and JP are working as lead reformers. 
		Reform is definitely a very good step and a need of time. But the 
		question is how and why these reforms are happening. Reforms should be 
		spontaneous, from self inspiration and not imposed by any outside power. 
		Questions arise when so called ‘reforms’ are initiated and dictatated 
		from an emergency born government who doesn’t have any legal validity 
		and guideline.&nbsp; Questions arise when that government directly and 
		indirectly backs some leaders to lead the reform process. There is no 
		basic principle, guideline and/or statute for these reforms. It appears 
		that reforms in these major political parties are being manipulated as 
		desired by some powerful people in current government like Bar Moinul 
		Hossain and Gens. Masud and Matin.&nbsp; People in general have nothing 
		against reform, rather they welcome it but few people would support 
		forced and dictated reforms; because at the end, this will not bring any 
		qualitative outcome. It is apparent that the target of all these so 
		called ‘reform’ is ultimately to implement “Minus Two” theory and break 
		up all major political parties and make them ineffective. Why? To 
		finally place a Hamid Karzai or Noor-e-Maliki in power. Let’s see one by 
		one whom this government has chosen as the lead reformers.</font></div>

	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><b><font face="Verdana" size="3">BNP Reformers:</font></b></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">BNP definitely needs 
		the maximum reform than any other party. In recent past when BNP- Jamat 
		was in power, we have seen the worst corruption, autocracy and crime of 
		BNP-Jamat leaders and caders. The power of BNP’s chairperson was 
		extremely enormous and the way she exercised her power can easily be 
		compared with worst autocrat dictator leaders of the world. The Daily 
		Star editor Mr. Mahfuz Anam in one of his commentaries called her 
		attitude as “Queen’s attitude”.&nbsp; Per Mr. Anam, Khaleda’s attitude was 
		that we should have been happy and pleased to get her as our ruler and 
		as if she had no responsibility from her side.&nbsp; The immediate target of 
		BNP reform is to get rid of Khaleda Zia. If Khaleda did any crime – 
		which apparently she did, she should be tried and people should judge 
		whether to accept her or reject her for the next government. 
		Unfortunately, all of the present reformer leaders never uttered a 
		single word against Khaleda in any forum or even in internal BNP 
		meetings. When Khaleda became the Prime Minister in 1991 during her 1st 
		tenure, she in her 1<sup>st</sup> cabinet meeting proposed to change the 
		name of Sher-e-Bangla Nagar as Zia Nagar. Some ministers applauded the 
		idea, some remained silent and it was only late Mr. Mirza Golum Hafiz 
		who objected to the idea. He said it won’t be wise to erase the name of 
		Sher-e-Bangla Fazlul Haque and replace that name by Zia’s. Khaleda Zia 
		was very unhappy and upset and she openly expressed her dissatisfaction. 
		She even didn’t go to see Mr. Hafiz during his last days in Sarwardy 
		hospital. Many of today’s reformer leaders also avoided visiting Mr. 
		Mirza Hafiz in the hospital simply because they didn’t want to make 
		madam unhappy. I do not want to produce a laundry list but will give one 
		or two examples of some reformer leaders chosen by this government.</font></div>

		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Once he was the most 
		vocal mouthpiece of Khaleda Zia but didn’t advise her even for a single 
		time about any of her wrong doings. He had a chance to make his dialogue 
		successful with AL secretary General Mr. Jalil but he just obeyed and 
		carried out Khaleda’s desire. How honest is Mr. Bhuiyan? Just one 
		example. During Ersahd regime, his one time comrade from United Peoples’ 
		Party (UPP) Mr. Mostofa Jamal Haider was the minister for Works. Mr. 
		Bhuiyan didn’t have his own residence to live. Government was allotting 
		newly constructed apartments in Dhanmondi. Mr. Bhuiya’s wife was a 
		teacher and he wanted an apartment in his wife’s name. His wife didn’t 
		qualify to get a government apartment. Mr. Bhuiyan made a special 
		request to Ershad via Mr. Mostofa Jamal Haider. Ershad told Mr. Haider 
		to allot one for Mrs. Bhuiyan. She was allotted one newly constructed 
		apartment in building “Balaka” at Dhanmondi Rd 7. In return, Mr. Bhuiyan 
		promised to help Ershad on certain issues which were against his party 
		BNP. That is, he sacrificed his principle for an apartment and made a 
		secret deal with Ershad to sabotage movement against him. Ershad also 
		gave him a handsome amount of cash gift to decorate the apartment.&nbsp; Mr. 
		Bhuiyan now has gorgeous house built in posh residential area in Dhaka. 
		There is a rumor that the ‘undercover power’ of current government 
		threatened Mr. Bhuiyan to take the lead or face corruption charges.</font></div>

		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">JP is no exception and 
		Rowshan Ershad had been the most corrupted influence on JP Chief Ershad. 
		People always blamed Ershad as a corrupt president and he definitely 
		was. But, Ershad never brought his family into power and corruption. His 
		brother GM Kader was not given any position during 9 long years of 
		Ershad’s tenure and he is an MP by his own pursuit. His younger sister 
		used to be a teacher at Vikarun Nessa when Ershad was president but few 
		people even knew about it. The son of Ershad’s elder sister used to work 
		as an engineer in BADC and people around him including his boss didn’t 
		know that he was a nephew of the President. Where as Rowshan’s 
		uneducated elder sister was made a state minister. Her husband was made 
		chief of BOESL (manpower exporting agency for the government). Whenever 
		a minister including Prime minister (Mizan, later Moudud and Kazi Zafar) 
		and 3 Deputy PMs (Moudud, Prof. Matin and Kazi Zafar) during Ershad era 
		stepped in Mymenshing, they had to visit Rowshan’s mother Sundari Begum 
		at her residence 1<sup>st</sup> before even going to circuit house. This 
		was mandatory even for speaker Shamsul Huda and later Vice President 
		Moudud.&nbsp; </font></div>

	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">One day Ershad’s army 
		chief Gen Atiq called Prime Minister Kazi Zafar and told him that his 
		job was in jeopardy. Why? Because on 10’0 clock news in BTV, Ershad was 
		shown first with some program, and then speaker of the parliament and 
		then Rowshan. Roshan was angry because she was the 1<sup>st</sup> lady 
		and was not shown before Speaker. She called Gen. Atik to let PM know 
		that it was PM’s fault as PM was in charge of the Information Ministry. 
		A veteran leader like Kazi Zafar had to swallow that and he called the 
		then BTV news Direction Mr. Faruk Alamgir to “correct” it and show in 
		the next news as per Roshan’s desire. Rowshan wasn’t happy and PM had to 
		show-cause and temporarily suspend BTV news director. Of course PM was 
		smart enough to handle that &amp; reinstate the news director next day by 
		convincing Ersahd.&nbsp; At another time, PM negotiated with the film 
		industry people who were on a hunger strike at press club. On 3<sup>rd</sup> 
		day of the hunger strike, PM went with some ministers and convinced them 
		to break their hunger strike.&nbsp; Again, Gen. Atiq called and said Roshan 
		was extremely angry because she wanted to break their hunger strike. 
		This time PM couldn’t even manage her via Ershad and left for Bangkok 
		for his treatment!</font></div>

		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Sk. Hasina is facing 4 
		cases filed by this government. Two were filed when she wanted to return 
		home from abroad and two were filed when she wanted to go abroad. Three 
		of the four cases are for extortion and one for Paltan incident. In none 
		of the 3 extortion cases, cops could find any evidence so far. All the 
		checks they pulled out from banks were issued to “self” and signed at 
		the back by illegible signatures.&nbsp; In the Paltan murder case filed by 
		Jamat, Hasina’s name is not even in the FIR. These cases are a quest to 
		silence and defame her. Where as Khaleda is responsible for so many 
		incidents during her last regime and still there is no case against her. 
		If we believe government leaked Babar’s statement, Khaleda is involved 
		in extortion cases at the expense of letting killers loose. Even if the 
		money went to party fund, the collection was illegal and immoral because 
		she let Basundhara chairman’s son and killers of Jamaluddin go at the 
		cost of that money. Not to mention about hundreds of extra judicial 
		killing by forces under Home Ministry of which she was the full 
		minister. Still Hasina faces cases and not Khaleda because Hasina vowed 
		that she won’t stop telling the truth and Khaleda is virtually silent. 
		Some columnist recently wrote, Hasina is the only man in the country now

	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">This government is not 
		a typical caretaker government responsible for conducting a free and 
		fair election. This government rather has an agenda. The Election 
		Commission (EC) is not behaving as autonomous body at all. Initially, EC 
		declared that reforms will be done in EC after discussing with political 
		parties. Now, they have withdrawn that statement. Last BNP-Jamat 
		government has done so much misrule and corruption that it was 
		impossible for them to go back to power. The best chance was for AL and 
		that is where some interested quarter interfered. They do not want AL in 
		power. The conspiracy is deep rooted.&nbsp; Mr. Fakruddin is just a signboard 
		and a nice civil face of the government. The undercover force has been 
		assigned the real job. </font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">This government wants 
		to break all the political parties (except Jamat) like Zia did. JP and 
		LDP have already done it. BNP is on the way to do it. It is hard to 
		break AL but government is hitting hard.&nbsp; They are threatening the AL 
		star leaders to cooperate or face jail. As sample, they have arrested 
		Jalil, Selim, Kader and all popular Mayors of AL. They didn’t release 
		Mayor Mohiuddin even though High Court wanted them to. These leaders are 
		all popular and tough organizers. If they have done any crime, they can 
		be tried but why they were denied bail.&nbsp; None of the Mayors would escape 
		from the country. </font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Why all these reforms 
		are being dictated and imposed? Why not let the parties do their own 
		reforms. We saw Sk. Hasina as the most popular leader when President 
		Yazuddin was driving the nation towards extreme chaos. Even Ersahd, B. 
		Chy, Col. Oli, Kamal Hossain everyone took shelter under her. And today 
		she has to be minused, why? Is it because she won’t serve the interest 
		of Pakistan and some big powers? Is it because it will be difficult to 
		manipulate our natural resources for the benefit of some richest 
		corporations in the world? </font></div>

	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Who would then serve

		the end of the day, all that government wants is to serve the purpose of 
		vested quarters and is trying hard to bring a Hamid Karzai or 
		Noor-e-Maliki in power. Current available options are, Dr. Kamal, Dr. 
		Yonus and Mr. Ferdous Quereshi.&nbsp; They need to minus Khalead and Hasina 
		and also to break all major parties in order to achieve that.</font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></div>
	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">That is why this 
		“reform” drama. There is no urge rather than few mere statements to 
		clean up partisan judges from higher courts, to clean up partisan

	<div class="MsoNormal">
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="3">People would appreciate 
		and support if current government focused on real reform instead of 
		getting involved in conspiracies and making reform dramas. In most of 
		the civilized nations including the USA and UK, it is the nation’s law 
		and not the political party’s agenda that determines how many times a 
		person can be head of the state or government. Our government can pass 
		that law after discussing with political parties. Instead, they are 
		involved in conspiracies with some leaders from different parties to 
		minus certain leaders. It seems they have a plan to minus other leaders 
		who would win in the elections. They need those seats vacant to let 
		people of their choice win.&nbsp; As if the government wants to form a new 
		team and wants that team to be the league champion. Instead of taking 
		the path of fair contest, government wants to incapacitate major players 
		of other teams so that their team of choice can win. This is not fair by 
		any means. Let EC discuss with different political parties and prepare 
		guidelines of reforms for all political parties; let government make 
		some basic laws on tenures of head of the government, and let government 
		punish the real culprits and make people more conscious. People will 
		finally choose whom to accept or reject.</font></div>
