          <a href="index.html">Shiraj Uddin Shopon</a></span></strong></font>&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">Notwithstanding many
          of the Über Alles folks’ view that everything is fine and dandy in
          Bangladesh it is my ardent belief our Sonar Bangla has become a den of
          the Islamic fundamentalists as time passes by.&nbsp; When the Talibans
          were retreating from Afghanistan, they were looking for a shelter.&nbsp;
          The sympathizers of Talibans in Pakistan got the best shelter in
          Bangladesh ruled by the fundy government of Jamaat-BNP under
          Nizami-Khaleda.&nbsp; Mr. Bertil Lintner wrote all about this in 2002.&nbsp;
          Not only that the Bangladeshi semi-Islamic and fundamentalist
          supporters and sympathizers have rigged the election in 2001 they had
          lent their support to install a puppet pro-Pakistani and pro-Saudi
          government in Dhaka.&nbsp; The characterless Bangladeshi Jamaati
          fundies have accepted a one-time beauty queen to be the supreme leader
          of their clique.&nbsp; Readers may have seen her pictures and I bet
          they will not miss her allure even at this advance age. She dresses
          and acts anachronistically, to say the least.&nbsp; She wears
          transparent see through costumes perhaps to attract the Houri-loving
          Jamaati Mullahs.&nbsp; She enjoys the fundy bees around her!&nbsp;
          With her allure, she is even fooling the foreign diplomats through her
          beguiling appearance.&nbsp; Nonetheless, she is a diehard supporter of
          the Bangladeshi fundies.&nbsp; This is why she is sharing power with
          the notorious fundamentalist Jamaat-i-Islami and Islami <i>Oyikko Jot</i>
          of Bangladesh and lately she condones the vigilante force’s action
          of an Islamic outfit in western Bangladesh.</font></span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">We have been getting
          horrible news of Talibanization of Bangladesh since the day this fundy
          government of Nizami-Khaleda took control of the government in October
          2001.&nbsp; Thanks to retired Justice Latifur Rahman and his close
          circle of ex-bureaucrats for the predictable election outcome.&nbsp;
          Since then, the cadres of BNP and Jamaat killed many Hindus, looted
          their property, and forced them to leave Bangladesh.&nbsp; The fundy
          government sheltered and protected the fundamentalists and Wahhabi
          Islamists all over Bangladesh.&nbsp; The Talibani outfits are active
          in different parts of Bangladesh.&nbsp; Khaleda has given them
          unlimited support, resources and shelter.&nbsp; A terrible Bangladeshi
          Taliban by the name “Bangla Bhai” is ruling the West and southwest
          parts of Bangladesh.&nbsp; The Jamaati police of Nizami-Khaleda are
          giving a cover up and the government supports for establishing
          Talibani rule of Bangla Bhai for the time being in western part of the
          nation.&nbsp; Many a reader may know that Afghan Mullah Omar captured
          Afghanistan with the support of Pakistani police and military.&nbsp;
          Afghanistan later became a safe den for the Islamists and terrorists.&nbsp;
          Likewise, Bangladesh is becoming another Afghanistan under the support
          of the pro-Pakistani Khaleda-Nizami fundy government.</font></span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">I bet, a number of Über
          Alles Bangladeshis had become upset when I finger point to their
          loving leader, Khaleda. These “military-generation” [some say Zia
          Generation] Bangladeshis live in a utopian land where they want to see
          the Beauty Queen of Bangladesh rule a la the Queen of Hearts as
          mentioned in ‘Alice in Wonderland.’&nbsp; They do not mind seeing
          the Houri-loving Jamaati fundies such as Nizami, Mujahid, and others
          such as Shaik-ul-Hadis, Delwar Hossain Saidee around the beguiling
          face.&nbsp; In a published photo in the newspaper I have seen Bangla
          Bhai and two other hujurs seated in the floor a la Islamic fashion as
          a framed photo of the beauty queen hangs in the wall above their head.&nbsp;
          Thus, one could see how Bangla Bhai is connected to the fundy patron
          and the beauty queen of Bangladesh.&nbsp; There should not be any
          doubt left on the fact that Bangladeshi Taliban “Bangla Bhai” is
          an ardent follower of the queen.&nbsp; The BNP-Jamaat government, MPs,
          other leaders and police provide active support to “Bangla Bhai”
          and JMJ men with Khaleda-Nizami’s blessings.</font></span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal"><span><font face="verdana">Under the patronage of
          Nizami and Khaleda, the Bangladeshi Talibans are becoming more
          desperate day by day.&nbsp; “Bangla Bhai” has become more hopeful
          to control whole Bangladesh someday.&nbsp; But, cunning Khaleda and
          her cohorts sometime get embarrassed when the Bangladeshi Talibans go
          off the limit.&nbsp; They realize that an impoverished country such as
          Bangladesh needs Uncle Sam's help.&nbsp; Especially, she needs donor
          countries money to build her family’s wealth with her son receiving
          the largest share.&nbsp; Uncle Sam does not like off-the-limit
          activities of the Bangladeshi moderate fundies.&nbsp; So, they give
          some pressure when things go too far beyond the limit.&nbsp; The
          actress knows the art of cajoling too!&nbsp; In order to please the
          donors she gave an order to arrest “Bangla Bhai” and I bet, she
          gave another order to her Cadre police to let “Bangla Bhai”
          escape.&nbsp; This art of acting in a dual role she learnt from her
          Pakistani military friends in the “difficult days” of1971.&nbsp;
          The world now knows the dual role of Pakistani military rulers in
          capturing Afghan Talibans.&nbsp; Readers may know the beauty queen is
          following the footsteps of Pakistani ISI.&nbsp; Uncle Sam should not
          let the actress play the dual role.&nbsp; She must detach herself from
          the fundies like “Bangla Bhai”, Razakar Nizami, Al-Badar Mujahid,
          and other vile Jamaatis and Oikkyo-jotians&nbsp;&nbsp; Bangladesh must
          be freed from the clutch of killer fundies.&nbsp; In order to do this,
          Bangladesh must first be freed from the rule of a coalition that is
          dominated by the minority party, Jamaat. The sooner the donor nations
          realize it, the better it is for the hapless and desperate people of
          Bangladesh.<O>
