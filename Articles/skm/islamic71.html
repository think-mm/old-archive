                  rulers and aided in every way to crush Bangalees’ dream of
                  independence. It was ordinary God-fearing Muslims (group-A
                  Bangalees, who were simply the sons and daughters of ordinary
                  Muslim familes, who never studied Koran and Hadiths, or never
                  studied in the Madrashas), Hindus, Buddhist, secularists,
                  leftists, atheists etc. fought along with those defector
                  freedom loving Bangalee police and soldiers. All of them had
                  just one single identity, and that was “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">BANGALEE
                  IDENTITY</b>. Their identity was neither Muslim nor
                  non-Muslim; they were all Bangalees. Their religious faith was
                  not any important issue then. Freedom fighters never wanted to
                  give or accept any color of religion to their struggle. Rather
                  they talked in one common voice and that was—“we are
                  Bangalees fighting for our emancipation from the oppression of
                  the Punjabis. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="color:red">The

                  at least by his heart, and his support to <i>Muktijuddho</i>
                  was very clandestine. Ms. Tasneem’s illustrated so- called
                  maulana shaheb was one such Muslim who had degree in history,
                  culture or library science. Most of all he was never <u>a true

                  during most of the entire1971 period. They got their lesson of
                  lifetime (we thought!) by the treachery of those Bangalee
                  Islamists, as well as, entire Muslim world. Freedom fighters
                  and all freedom-loving Bangalees used to be frightened or
                  panicked when they saw any bearded maulana and true Islamist
                  in front of them. All <i>Muktijoddhas</i> (freedom fighters)
                  used to hide their identity from these Islamists for very good
                  reason. Because, no freedom fighter could trust these
                  Islamists since they could be either Razakar commander or
                  informer of Pakistani junta. During the nine months of 1971
                  (March 26-December 15), common Bagalee freedom-loving people
                  did not trust these Islamists and developed common hatreds
                  towards all Islamists. More and more freedom fighters had
                  begun to abhor these treacherous religious fanatics and loved
                  secularism. They did not separate Bangalees by virtue of their
                  religious faith; rather they considered all Muslims, Hindus,
                  Christians, Buddhas etc. as Bangalee <i>muktijuddhas</i> who
