  the said Zul-Quarnain mentined in Quran is the Greek conqueror Alexander the
  great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here are some source from
  where Islamic thinkers perhaps got this idea of Quranic Zul-qarniain as
  Alexander the great. The famous Quranic translator maulana A. Yousuf Ali gave
  a long story as Appendix Vll (titled: Who was Zulqarnain; page 760-765)
  detailing the facts and figures why most Islamic scholars including himself
  considered very strongly that, Quranic Zulqarnain was nobody but Alexander the
  Great. In this long Appendix, maulana yousuf Ali tried to justify why he
  thought that the person in Quran by the name of Zul-qarnain was nobody but
  Alexander the Great. Readers please see for yourself the above mentioned
  appendix in the Maulana Yousuf ali’s Translated Quran. Because, here in this

  The Barrier in the text must have been more in the nature of iron gates then a

  great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both are near a town
  Derbend, and have borne the name of bab-ul-hadid (Arabic word for iron gate).
  The best known iron gate in modern times is at the town and seaport of derbend

  </span>They were the Mongol tribes on the other side of the Barrier, while the

  point in the mention of Alexander’s westward journey (Quran:18:86):<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>“He saw the sun set in a piece of murky water which is described as a
  spring. Most commentators have understood the “spring” to be the sea, and
  takes the “murky water” to be the dark blue water<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">……</b>..to
  the west of the town of Lychnis is a lake 170 square miles in area fed by
  underground springs that issue through limestone rocks and give out murky
  water. Both town and lake is now called Ochrida, about 50 miles west of
  Monastir. The water is so dark that the river which forms the outlet of the
  lake to the north is called the Black Drin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Looking at the Sun-set from the Town, the observer would see the sun
  set in a pool of murky water (Quran-18:86). History tell us that, it was a
  question before the boy King Alexander—the dreamy, impulsive, fearless
  rider, whether he would put the barbarous Illyriccans to the sword or show

  consolidated his power in the west. This I (Yousuf Ali) construe to be the
  meaning of verses (18:86-87); otherwise these verses do not seem to be
  perfectly clear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another point
  may be noted. Three episodes mentioned are: (1) journey <u>to the west</u>,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>(2)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the journey <u>to the
  east</u>,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(3) and journey to the <u>“Iron
  Gate</u>”: The journey to the west I have just explained. The journey to the
  east was to the Persian Empire. Here he found a people who lived in the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: blue">open
  and wore little clothing</span></b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
  might apply to people who lived in an inland place in the latitude of
  Persepolis or Multan. He left them alone as they were (Quran:18:91).”<O:P>

  <p><font color="#003300">As I mentioned in my previous essay that, Maulana
  Yousuf Ali was an educated Mullah who frequently gave a very sensible/modern
  explanation to Quranic Ayats (unlike other Madrasa educated Mullah) and by
  doing that he put Quranic diviness in clear jeopardy. Therefore, to save
  Quranic diviness, he at the same time made some incongruous arguments to save
  Allah’s integrity. Here in this explanation of Quranic Folklore story about
  Alexander he created very logical historical background but by doing this he
  put Allah in a precarious situation because of the fact that Alexander was not
  a believer as Quran postulated by various Ayats. So to save Allah’s side,
  Maulana erected some ludicrous logic: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="COLOR: blue">“Alexander
  was a focus of Christian and Jewish learning for some centuries. The
  Christians also made Alexander a saint. The Jews carried the Alexander cycle
  into the east. Our Persian poet Jami (A,H. 535-599, A.D. 1141-1203) worked it
  up into his epic the Iskandar-nama.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>He is careful to show the historical or semihistorical and the ethical
  parts separately. The one relates to action or exploits (Iqbal) and the other
  to wisdom (Khirad). He had the advantage of Quran’s story before him. The
  story mentions three historical episodes incidentally, but draws our attention
  to matters of the weightiest spiritual significance, and that is the chief
  thing to note in the story. All that is known about Alexander the Great shows
  that he was a man of lofty ideals. He died over three centuries before the
  time of Jesus, but that does not mean that he was not a man of faith, for God
  revealed Himself to men of all nations in all ages. Alexander was an disciple
  of philosopher Aristotle, noted for his pursuit of sound Truth in all
  departments of thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>”<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><O:P>

  who do not consider Zul-qarnain as the Alexander the great:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>How can you deny all these (above) arguments by Maulana Yousuf Ali?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Apologists are in real problem with this simulation of Zul-qarnain
  story because ancient history does not give us any such character which fits
  with Zul-qarnain story in Quran. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Zul-qarnain
  story exactly fits with the historical facts of</b> <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">the
  Alexander the Great</b>. But Mullahs are in real problem to accept Alexander
  as Zul-qarnain, as because, Alexander <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">was
  a pagan</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interestingly, if
  the Alexander was a believer or at least somebody from any of the three
  monotheistic religions of the world, Mullahs would immediately jump to the
  conclusion that—Zul-qarnain is no one but Alexander the Great. <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: blue">Readers
  should ponder—why Quranic Zul-qarnain story matches 100% with the story of
  Alexander the Great? Could it be a mere co-incidence?<O:P>

  <p><font color="#003300">Any Muslims (especially Bangladeshi) who experienced
  “Waz-Mehfil” of a half-educated, or Madrasha (Taliban Factory) educated
  maulana—have definitely enjoyed the superstitious and mythological
  description of “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Yajuj and majuj</b>”
  (of this fanciful Zul-qarnain story) as the terrible Giants who will erupt
  from some parts of Syria and will destroy this beautiful world of Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Then it is the Prophet Issa (Jesus Christ) who will come again to fight
  this “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Yajuj and majuj</b>” to save
  the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This colorful
  superstitious story is believed by hundreds of millions of blind-faith muslims,
  just the way they believe that Qur’an is the word of Allah. However, this
  historical statement in Qur’an is seriously erroneous. Because the ancient
  history tells us that Alexander was a licentious, belligerent, idolatrous, and
  claimed to be the son of Amun, the God of Egypt. And Qur'an amazingly stated
  that, the Alexander was the one who reached the west point of flat earth (?),
  to a end point where sun set down in a well of muddy water, and also he
  reached the point of east end of the earth where he saw sun was rising.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>About two years ago, America's PBS telecast a multi-part series on
  Alexander the Great. In one episode, it was shown that two Qur'anic scholars
  from Middle East (Arab) read a passage on Alexander. He was described in
  Qur'an as a demon with two horns who caused much destruction on earth. The
  commentator, an English professor, remarked that Alexander's disheveled hairdo
  and the shape of his head indeed portray him as a person with two horns.
  Perhaps it was a folklore that this brute Alexander--a devil with two
  horns--had passed through a big chunk of Arab land. Still now, people can
  visit some remote parts of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, NWFP of Pakistan,
  and Punjab and hear some folk melodies in which a man name Eskander or
  Sikander is glorified as a fierce fighter. The bottom line is that Qur'an has
  obviously borrowed this folklore story that was prevailing in Arab peninsula.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

  <p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><font color="#003300">Like the one
  I just described above, there are many stories in the Quran which were taken
  from</font></b><font color="#003300">: local folklore, the fanciful details of
  Jewish writers, local stories from Arab heretical Christians, mythological
  stories from Zoarostrians who apparently got from Hindu mythology. Here are
  some examples of folklore which Quranic author obviously borrowed from various
  sources:</font></p>

  <p><font color="#003300">Quran took this name “Azazil” from Jews who call
  the evil spirit by the same name. But the story of Azazil was taken from
  Zoroastrian book of 5. Let us see the comparison of the two:</font></p>

  (Muslim) version of the story</font></b><font color="#003300">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>Allah created Azazil, who in the seventh hell worshiped the Almighty
  for a thousand years; he then ascended, spending a similar term at each stage,
  till he reached the earth. Elsewhere we read rhat the Devil (Azazil) stayed
  three thousand years close by the gate of the paradise, with hostile
  intentions against Adam and Eve, of whom he entertained the utmost jealousy.</font></p>

  </span>He remained in the abyss, dark and ignorant, there to commit hurt and
  injury, and such mischief and darkness is the place that they term the dark
  region. Ormazed (Zoarostrian name of God), who knew everything was aware of
  Ahriman’s(evil) existence and designs. Both remained thus for 3000 years,
  without change or action. The evil spirirt was ignorant of Ormazed’s
  existence; but eventually rising out of the pit, at least behind the light of
  Ormazed; then filled with hostility and envy, he set to work to destroy.</font></p>
