                  is, of course, an Islamic justice to the infidels, criminals, 
                  and sinners. This cruel way of killing infidels is sanctioned 
                  by Islamic Sharia laws. Denial to the grotesque beheading of 
                  western Kaffirs by those Islamic terrorists (in Iraq) that it 
                  is not Islamic is yet another<span style="layout-grid-mode: line">
                  </span><span style="layout-grid-mode: line">clear sign of 
                  ignorance, hypocrisy, or intellectual dishonesty by the 
                  defenders of Islam. Islamists are not ready to take the burden 
                  of ugly reality of the fact that human beheading <u>is 100% 
                  consistent</u> with the sacred Islamic Jihadi practices. 
                  Hatreds towards other religion such as Jews, Christians, 
                  Hindus and other polytheists are the ardent teachings of 
                  Islamic holy book Qur’an. Beheading was practiced by the 
                  Prophet Muhammad himself during the 7<sup>th</sup> century 
                  period of Islam and by the most Islamic rulers thereafter.

                  Saddest thing is no Islamists will ever tell you the truth 
                  about the intimate relation of beheading in Islam! Following 
                  the recent beheadings of Americans and other foreigners in 
                  Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the U.S. press turned to various 
                  experts to identify a precedent in the Quran or Islamic 
                  history for this kind of gory murder. Look what were the 
                  answers by some erudite but hypocritical Mullahs! Imam 
                  Muhammad Adam El-Sheik, co-founder and chief cleric at the Dar 
                  Al Hijrah Mosque at falls Church, VA told to the USA today: “<b>Beheadings 
                  are not mentioned in the Koran at all</b>&quot;. Yvonne Haddad, a 
                  professor at the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at 
                  Georgetown University has agreed with the above Imam and added 
                  (to N<em>ew<span style="font-style: normal"> York Newsday):</span>
                  </em>&quot;<b>There is absolutely nothing in</b> <b>Islam that 
                  justifies cutting off a person's head</b>.” You go ask any 
                  Imam or mullah in the US, you will come up with the same lies 
                  again and again. &nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">Obviously, had it not been the sacred 
                  custom of ancient Islam, beheading would be quite unnecessary 
                  method to kill enemies by those Islamic terrorists in Iraq. 
                  Those Islamic terrorists could easily kill their infidel 
                  enemies (such as Daniel Pearl, Nich berg, Kim Sun II, Paul 
                  Johnson etc.) by a simple bullet. But those militants actually 
                  wanted to give an <b>Islamic veneer</b> <b>to the infidel 
                  slayings</b> —because killing by beheading is considered most 
                  brutal and utterly degrading, and only western infidels 
                  deserve this type of brutal killing. In fact they only tried 
                  to follow the footsteps Prophet Muhammad and devoutly followed 
                  the Allah’s order in the Qur’an. Holy Quran is replete with 
                  the harsh verses which directly order Muslims to behead 
                  Kaffirs/infidels. Let me cite some sample of those verses 
                  below: <span style="font-family: Verdana Ref; color: #003300">

                  their neck is largely new terrain for the Arab media. As a 
                  media critic whose focus is the Arab world, I have watched 
                  perhaps a dozen Arab channels and read countless newspapers in 
                  recent weeks. I found that few Arab commentators and 
                  journalists noted either that major shift or its significance. 
                  In particular, the Kim and Johnson beheadings generally have 
                  been reported <u>as if they were quite ordinary</u>.</i></p>

                  <p style="margin: 5.0pt .05pt"><i>Al-Jazeera is the famous 
                  Arab network that <b>calls every Arab suicide bomber a shaheed</b>, 
                  or martyr. Islamic radicals have killed writers in Algeria, 
                  Egypt and elsewhere whose work challenged the logic of 
                  martyrdom and &quot;random jihad,&quot; or killing foreigners in the 
                  name of Islam. But the lack of condemnation of the beheadings, 
                  despite their barbarism, is a direct result of a broad and 
                  dangerous trend in Arab media and in Arab culture broadly. The 
                  Arab world today swims in a sea of linguistic violence that 
                  justifies terrorism and makes it acceptable, especially to the 
                  young. </i></p>

                  graduated from a Pennsylvania university said of Americans, 
                  &quot;Don't believe them when they say it is al Qaeda that is 
                  slaying Americans. It is Americans who are killing Americans

                  Why Killing Islamically: (?)</span></b>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="Blockquote">Perhaps, many can not quite conceive why 
                  these Islamic terrorists use this ancient barbaric method of 
                  beheading (by sword, knives or Axes) to kill kaffirs, instead 
                  of using simple and sure method of bullets. This is because 
                  they are the true Muslims and true followers of the best human 
                  Prophet Muhammad. It’s not true that they have any shortage of 
                  guns and pistols. But they are afraid to disobeying Prophet’s 
                  methods and tactics prescribed by the holy Quran. They are 
                  desperate to get full benefits (<i>getting lucrative Islamic 
                  heavens as promised by the Quran</i>) of their service to 
                  Islam. Therefore they are bound to use Prophetic methods (read 
                  Islamic style) of killing/assassinating the enemies of Allah 
                  and Prophet <b><span style="color: red">by slitting</span></b>
                  <b><span style="color: red">necks</span></b>, cutting hands 
                  and legs by a long curve sword. This is the same good reason 
                  why in Bangladesh—Jamati Islami,s (a political party) 
                  student-wing Chatra-Shibir’s jihadis use to kill their 
                  opponents by cutting hands and feet. They want to follow 
                  everything as per Islamic code. <b>Because Islam still sits 
                  and firmly anchored in the 7<sup>th</sup> century medieval 
                  period and never will move ahead. </b></p>

                  <p class="Blockquote">Hope it is now clear why Islamic jihadis 
                  are cutting necks (beheading), chopping wrists, hands and legs 
                  of anybody who dares to go against Allah and Prophet. Because 
                  they know more than anybody of us that ‘beheading’ is of 
                  course, prescribed method of Islamic killing. Islamists also 
                  consider beheading as the most degrading way of killing lowly 
                  human beings (called Kaffirs) and they love to use this brutal 
                  barbaric method to kill any infidels, because they hate 
                  infidels worst than the dog. </p>
                  <p class="Blockquote">Thanks to our blind-eyed hypocritical 
                  Muslim elites (both residing inside their native lands and 
                  outside in the western paradise of democracy) for their 
                  intentional ignorance about the real Islam. Their broken 
                  records of “<i>this is not real Islam</i>” will only add more 
                  fuel to the infernos of jihadis mindsets to commit more and 
                  more Islamic barbarism. Uttering the most heinous phrase: <b>
                  “This is not the real Islam</b>” will do no good to the 
                  millions of Muslims. Mind you, Islamic terrorists, al-Qaeda 
                  jihadists, Osama-bin-laden, and so called Wahabi followers are 
                  all perfect and real Muslims by the book. They are the ardent 
                  followers of the Islamic scriptures. These jihadis will never 
                  listen to your logic or advice; they all will take advice and 
                  teachings from the Holy book called Quran and sahi hadiths 
                  (traditions of Prophet Muhammad).</p>
                  <p class="Blockquote">Time has arrived now to identify and 
                  intervening the real cause of this ancient medieval stupidity. 
                  Real problem is with the ancient teachings of Islam (read 
                  Qur’an) which are outdated and no longer fitting the today’s 
                  civilized world. Nothing can change this precarious situation 
                  of Muslims unless we realize the real problem and take care of 
                  it.</p>
