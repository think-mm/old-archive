                  and again Islamists are coming with the ‘cannons and guns’
                  of Islami Science, if there is such a thing in this world call
                  ‘Religious Science.’&nbsp; That is, blind-folded Muslims

                  am a small person in this vast scientific field, i.e.; I make
                  my ends meet by providing scientific knowledge to my employer
                  in an extremely narrow area.&nbsp; For the last 30 some years,
                  I am dealing with science, but unfortunately, I never found
                  anywhere in the universe of modern-day science that is made by
                  any world religion. That is, I did not find Islamic science,
                  Christian Science or any Hindu science.&nbsp; I have written
                  many times that “<b>No religion can claim science its
                  property</b>.”&nbsp; All my life I have been hearing that,
                  religion and science do not mix and match all that wells.&nbsp;
                  Some may even say that science and religion do not see
                  eye-to-eye.&nbsp; Again, some person with an extreme view may
                  also bluntly put before you that science and religion are the
                  enemy of each other.&nbsp; I have also learned that, if I
                  believe in science, then it is difficult to believe in
                  religious dogmas.&nbsp; That means these two things (religion
                  and science) are like oil and water—can not go mix. In the
                  most religious schools (Madrashas) of Bangladesh, it is
                  prohibited to study science.&nbsp; Take for example Sir
                  Charles Darwin’s <i>Theory of Evolution</i>.&nbsp; Although
                  widely and totally accepted by modern science, the
                  religionists will have hard time accepting Darwin’s
                  conclusions.&nbsp; Therefore, Bangladeshi Mullahs or the
                  Mullahs throughout the world do not believe in evolution one
                  hundred percent.&nbsp; So, what makes science and religion a
                  good match?</span></p>

                  Muslim-background Nobel laureate Dr. Salam also could not find
                  any science that belongs to any religion.&nbsp; But
                  interestingly enough, Dr. Salam also became an Islamic
                  scientist by the wishful dream of some Islamists around the

                  Salam became pious Muslim overnight. What a miracle? Some over
                  zealous Islamists called Dr. Salam’s achievement as
                  “Islamic science”. Question is how can the science do

                  were scientists and scholars by dint of their critical mind
                  and thinking, being inspired by Greek, Indian and Babylonian
                  civilizations. It was not DUE to Islam that their talent
                  flourished and shone. There is no Islamic gene. Rather their
                  achievements can be characterized as DESPITE Islam. All these
                  scientists, physicians were champions of reason and critical
                  thinking; they never credited the scripture for their success
                  or for inspiration. It is well known that talents thrive in an
                  open atmosphere, when no divine restrictions are imposed on

                  had been at odds with science, still is at odds, and it will
                  remain so until all religions would take demise from this
                  mortal world. After the renaissance (i.e. during the last 3-4
                  centuries)—in the marathon race of dominance, science had
                  won and religion had lost.&nbsp; This is pure and simple.&nbsp;
                  Now, to compete science, every religionists searching science
                  in their scriptures with a massive magnifying glass. Islam is
                  the champion in this line.&nbsp; Alas, there could be no
                  science in the scriptures of Islam or in any religion for
                  sure.&nbsp; I myself first read Qur’an and Hadiths (after I
                  read the book of M. Bucaille) in search of science, but <b><u>could
                  not find/match</u></b> a single verse/Hadiths with modern-day
                  science.&nbsp; I was dismayed how M. Bucaille fooled Muslims
                  to earn his millions.&nbsp; He surely fooled the gullible
                  Muslims while pocketing a large sum of money.&nbsp; This does
                  not bode well for Muslims.&nbsp; They have been portrayed as

                  me to juxtapose Secularism and democracy vis-à-vis a blind

                  AND DEMOCRACY</b>” which can boost for science and not any
                  RELIGION for sure. The European Renaissance was born in the
                  yoke of SACULARISM AND DEMOCRACY.&nbsp; Europe was at the dark
                  as long as they were submerged with religious dogmas.&nbsp;
                  Scores of scientists, freethinkers lost their lives at the

                  the spell of darkness and they are taking a journey driving
                  their locomotive in the reverse gear.&nbsp; And this is very
                  true in the field of science. Good examples are Iran,
                  Afghanistan, and all other Muslim countries as well.&nbsp; As

                  Persian, Greek (Hellenistic), Roman, Islamic Arab, etc.&nbsp;
                  All of this civilization took part in the “<b>RELAY RACE</b>”
                  of shaping up ancient science, which was the building block of
                  modern science.&nbsp; Ancient Egyptians (3000 BC) studied the
                  heavens to forecast seasons, used advanced geometry to build
                  Pyramids.&nbsp; They also learned human anatomy, physiology,
                  surgery and medicine, etc.&nbsp; All of the above mentioned
                  ancient pre-Arab civilizations were very advanced in medicine,
                  astronomy, geometry, mathematics and other scientific fields
                  much before the arrival of Islamic-Arab civilization.</span></p>

                  Mesopotamian civilizations, whose scholars and scientists were
                  their priests, and to them we owe foundations of medicine,
                  navigation, astronomy and some mathematics. The second

                  from the above quotation?&nbsp; One could see in the statement
                  of George Sarton the echo of my thesis.&nbsp; That is science
                  is the product of continuous <b>RELAY RACE</b>
                  (development/research) by many different civilizations one
                  after another.&nbsp; In the history of mankind, civilization
                  always took shape by some popular slogans/manifesto by
                  different nations.&nbsp; Some came with nationalistic spirits
                  (such as Persian, Roman, Chinese, Indian, etc.), and some came
                  with the popular slogans of religion (such as Arab).&nbsp; In
                  true sense, all of them were imperialistic forces in some
                  different names and identity, and their main objective was to
                  conquer new lands to gain wealth and power.&nbsp; Every
                  civilization when got some tranquility and peaceful times, it
                  flourished in various (scientific, social, political, etc.)
                  fields.&nbsp; Islamic-Arab revolution was no exception. The
                  recent PBS documentary by Mr. Robert Gardner, “Islam: Empire
                  of Faith,” clearly showed the Arab imperialistic history.&nbsp;
                  This film failed to show any spirituality or, should I say
                  divinity, which was purely absent in Islamic utopia.&nbsp; The
                  viewers will have hard time forgetting that violence ad
                  infinitum, those naked terrorizing bend swords, or scores of
                  conspiracies to kill the rivals, own sons, own friend.&nbsp;
                  These are of course not at all signs of so-called peaceful
                  religion.&nbsp; Instead, the viewers will mostly remember
                  Islam as <b>the NAKED SWORD WAVING MEGALOMANIAC IMPERILISTIC

                  often talking about the modern scientific debt to Islamic
                  civilization, but they never say anything about the Arab’s
                  scientific debt to those ancient civilizations, and I wonder
                  why they are so reluctant to give any credits to those who
                  deserve it?&nbsp; Can any Islamist tell us what the source of
                  Islamic science was?&nbsp; Was it from Qur’an or Hadiths, or
                  did it come from the heaven through the courtesy of winged

                  civilization did not see the light of science until the middle
                  of 8<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; There was hardly any science

                  point of this history is to show how the golden age that
                  Islamists/ fundamentalists refer to was achieved only because
                  Baghdad was wide open to foreign influences, much as the
                  United States at its birth imported ideas of the enlightenment
                  from Europe and made more of them than did the Old World. One
                  can go further. Many of the scholars who translated the
                  manuscripts of the Greeks, Indians and Chinese, and who
                  flocked to Baghdad in the golden age, were <b>Christians, Jews
                  and pagans</b>. Although the West as we know it today didn't
                  exist in the 9th and 10th centuries, one could say that the
                  Arab world was, for a time, part of the intellectual circle
                  that would become the West. Many of the Greek classics reached
                  Europe via Muslim Toledo, in Spain, where they were translated

                  entirely during the period of liberal freethinking Caliphs of
                  Abbasid dynasty. The seventh Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun
                  (813-833), was even a greater patron of education and science
                  than Harun al-Rashid. He took considerable pains to obtain
                  Greek manuscripts and even sent a mission to the Byzantine
                  Emperor Leon the Armenian (8l3 to 890) for that purpose. He
                  ordered the translation of these manuscripts. He organized at
                  Baghdad a sort of scientific academy called the House of
                  Wisdom (Bayt al-hilkma), which included a library and an
                  observatory. He encouraged scholars from all kinds (various
                  religions), and an enormous amount of scientific work was done
                  under his patronage. This was the most ambitious undertaking
                  of its kind since the foundation of the Alexandrian Museum (q.
                  v. first half of third century B. C.).</p>

                  in Baghdad in 786, and he died near Tarsus in 833. Al-Ma’mun
                  was the seventh and greatest 'Abbasid caliph (813-833). His
                  mother and wife were Persians, which explains his Persian and
                  'Alid proclivities. He was an ardent Mu'tazil, tried to
                  enforce his views by means of violence. He wrote four long
                  letters to explain the <b>Qur’an was created</b>, and he
                  cruelly punished those who dared entertain different views
                  (e.g., Ibn Hannibal). He thus combined in a remarkable way
                  free thought and intolerance. While persecuting those who
                  objected to Mu'tazilism, Jews and Christians were very welcome
                  at his court. History is the witness that, the religion Islam

                  <b>The Mathematics</b>: In the late eighth century, an Indian
                  merchant brought to Baghdad two seminal mathematical works.
                  One was the Brahmasphuta Siddhanta, known to Arabs as the
                  Sindhind, the work of the great seventh-century Indian
                  mathematician Brahmagupta. This contained early ideas about
                  al-jabr, to give algebra its Arabic name. It was this work
                  that Muhammad ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi in the ninth century was
                  to expand on so successfully. Khwarizmi became known as
                  &quot;the father of algebra&quot; and gave his name to
                  algorithms.<br>
                  <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt"><br>
                  </span>The same Indian merchant also brought a manuscript that
                  introduced for the first time outside India the nine Hindu&nbsp;
                  numerals we use to this day and are now called Arabic
                  numerals. (Before that, numbers were written out as words or
                  notated with letters of the alphabet.) This document also
                  contained <b>the first mention of the 0,</b> <b>which the
                  Arabs</b> <b>called zephirum,</b> from which our words zero
                  and cipher are derived. But again, it was the Baghdadis who
                  built on these imported innovations, to create what one
                  historian of mathematics has called &quot;the Arabic
                  hegemony.&quot; In addition to Khwarizmi, this group included

                  the West), Nasir<br>
                  Eddin and Omar Khayyam (he of &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; fame).<span style="FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt"><br>

                  Japanese are known to be a practitioner of that policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Another interesting point is most of those renowned Muslim
                  scientists were non-Arab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as: Al-Khwarizmi
                  (Uzbekistan); Al-Razi (Tehran); Al-Ghazzali (Khorman, Iran);
                  Al-Tabari (Tabristan); Al-Farabi (Turkistan); Al-Biruni (Khwarizm,
                  Uzbekistan); Ibn Sina (Bukhara, Central Asia); Ibn Rushd
                  (Cordoba, Spain) and so on. &nbsp;All those
                  scientists/philosophers happened to be sons of Muslim.&nbsp;
                  None of them were a Mullah or Maolana, and <b>none of them
                  ever claimed that they got scientific theory by reading
                  Qur’an or gobbling the Hadiths.&nbsp; Then, why do all those
                  Islamists bring religion in the field of science?&nbsp; Is
                  there any ulterior motive?</b></p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Religion of any type
                  (Christian, Jews, Islam, Hinduism etc.) can never claim
                  Science as their own property. Similarly, religion should
                  never claim any credit whatsoever, for the advancement of any
                  science. Galileo was a great scientist by his knowledge not
                  because he was a son of Christian. In the same vein, Ibne Sina
                  was a scientist by virtue of his quality and not because he
                  was a son of Muslim. Einstein was a great scientist because of
                  his intellect and acuity, not because of his knowledge of
                  Torah.&nbsp; <b>Today, almost 95% of world’s leading
                  scientists are the sons of Christians.&nbsp; Should we then
                  consider that Christian religion/Bible are the storehouse of
                  all science?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the world history support this?&nbsp;
                  Or, should we say that ancient Hindu Kafirs got science of
                  mathematics (numerals) from Rada krishna?</b></p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><em><span style="FONT-STYLE: normal">Islamists
                  frequently claim that the Koran is full of exhortation to the
                  believers to study nature and to find the signs of God in the
                  phenomena of nature. But </span></em>I did not find any
                  Qur’anic verse that asked people to study the nature, rather
                  Allah tried to show those nature (Sky, Earth, Sun, Moon,
                  Stars, etc.) as the evidence that Allah is really very
                  powerful who can create all those naturally impossible things.&nbsp;
                  Now, do we have to believe that, before the arrival of
                  Qur’an mankind never saw the sky (heaven), earth, sun, moon
                  and stars?&nbsp; What Qur’an told about the nature, even
                  cave peoples could have seen them very well by their own bare
                  eyes.&nbsp; Yes, Qur’an repeatedly talked about heaven,
                  earth, sun, moon, stars, etc., just to exhibit the strength
                  (threat) and might of Allah and repeatedly told human being to
                  think about this miracle of placing sky as the canopy (which
                  is ridiculous) without pillars, making stars to shoot the
                  Satan, placing mountain to make the earth immovable, created
                  thunder to shoot the sinners, created earthquake to punish the
                  kafirs, revolving poor sun daily to make day and night, making
                  wide and flat earth, etc. and a whole slue of other things to
                  reel your head.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, are those Allah’s assertions
                  anyway to be taken as scientific theory?&nbsp; What is the
                  actual point? Should we go back to fundamentals of Islam and
                  establish true Islamic dogmas (because according to some
                  apologists only Islam can inspire science) like Afghan
                  Talibans? Should we banned all western style education
                  systems; should we banned all secularism, and establish<i>
                  “Kaoumi Madrashas” or “Alia madrashas” </i>to bring
                  back our Islamic science?&nbsp; Come on give me break !&nbsp;</p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">Now let me put some very
                  prudent questions: <b>(a</b>) If the Islamists still consider
                  that Arab got the ancient science from Qur’an or Hadiths,
                  then would it not be normal that those Islamic Mullahs would
                  discover the science first?&nbsp; <b>(b)</b> Would it not be
                  normal to expect the revolution of science coming first from
                  all those Maulanas, Qaari, Imams, Muftis, teachers of all
                  Madrashas, all Madrassah students, all Talibans—simply
                  because these are the people who are really expert in Qur’an
                  and Hadiths?&nbsp; <b>(c)</b> If Islamic Arab civilization
                  derived scientific knowledge from the religion (Qur’an and
                  Hadiths) and they brought some science to the West, then after
                  that, what made those Muslims totally burned out and become
                  obsolete in the field of science today? <b>(d)</b> Should it
                  not be a normal phenomenon that, in today’s modern
                  scientific race, Muslims would still lead the rest of the
                  world?&nbsp;&nbsp; (<b>e</b>) Since some apologists believe
                  religion has no quarrel with science—could we ask all
                  Islamic Mullahs to declare <b>Darwin Evolution Theory is </b>acceptable
                  to Islamic theologians?&nbsp; <b>(f)</b> Could any Islamist
                  tell us what are the reasons that none of the Muslim nations
                  come even close to other advanced nations in the field of
                  science?</p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">There is still time left
                  for writers who are sympathetic to science and who are driven

                  repressive age-old religions.&nbsp; There shouldn’t be any
