                  <p class="MsoNormal">Islam is the champion of irrationality
                  and myths, that is, Islam possesses more myths and
                  superstitions than any other monotheistic and monolithic
                  religion of the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Muslims
                  widely believe that—Mosque, The <i>Kaaba-Sharif</i>, The
                  Holy Koran never can be burned by fire, or Holy war and holy
                  Jihad can never be defeated. Because, holy war/Jihad is always
                  supported by Allah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Islamic
                  histories are loaded with myths and superstitions, which
                  mullahs widely believe them. Prophet Muhammad’s success in
                  his wars with pagan Arabs was seen as the divine blessings
                  directly from Allah. There are very many stories of Angelic
                  assistance and help in the holy wars of Muslims that were
                  fought in the 7<sup>th</sup> century period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>The Koran and Hadith mentioned many such divine
                  interventions in the holy wars, as if, Allah’s Angels and
                  His Prophet fought the wars side-by-side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Nevertheless, these were all but wishful, fabricated
                  and fictitious stories Muslims swallowed in early period of
                  brainwashing by Islamic myths and by rote learning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
                  </O:P>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">In many occasions of Indo-Pak
                  wars—Pakistani soldiers and some devout Muslims used to
                  believe that there would be some sort of divine intervention
                  to protect Pakistan from the infidel Indians. During the Gulf
                  War in 1991, some devout Muslims residing in the comfort zone
                  of infidel USA aggressively argued with me that—infidel
                  soldiers of America will not win the war with Iraq, because
                  Iraq especially Baghdad is laden with many Muslim’s Holy
                  places such as Bara Pir’s <i>Dargha</i>, etc., and they
                  hoped that there will be some sort of divine intervention from
                  Allah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Saddam
                  Hussein repeatedly claimed that Merciful Allah is on his side,
                  he declared Holy war against America, therefore, infidel force
                  will be defeated. Well, we all know what had happened to that
                  Allah’s party in the Gulf War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<O:P>
                  </O:P>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">The arguments and reasons cited by those
                  wishful Muslims who supported Iraq during the Gulf War were of
                  two different folds. (1) Iraq is a Muslim country and America
                  and the west are the infidel nations, therefore Muslims, the
                  Allah’s party, will defeat the infidels. (2) America is the
                  paper tiger that was defeated by Vietnam people. Therefore,
                  general hope among the Muslims was that America would be
                  defeated by Muslim Iraq. The fact of the matter is, America
                  was never defeated by Vietnam; America was actually defeated
                  by the joint forces of Soviet Russia, China and Vietnamese.
                  That is, America fought not just the Vietcong guerrillas
                  alone, but America actually fought the combined forces of
                  USSR, China and Vietnam—a formidable force indeed.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">During the Afghan War with Soviet Russia
                  in late ‘80s—the united force of Afghan Mujaheedin did not
                  defeat Russia alone. Russia was defeated by another super
                  power America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Russia
                  had to fight fanatic Afghan <i>Mujaheedin</i> armed with 100%
                  by the most modern American weapons. Had there been no supply
                  of American modern weapons and no boosting of morale
                  (supports) by America, Britain and all the Muslim world—it
                  would be absolutely impossible to defeat a super power such as
                  Soviet Russia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
                  strange thing is, Afghan <i>Mujaheedins</i> mistakenly thought
                  that their victory against the super power Russia had to do
                  with some kind of divine intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Afghan Mujaheedin and Talibans considered Russia
                  infidel godless force, and their victory against this infidel
                  super power was taken <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">as
                  the Allah’s mercy to those pure Muslims of Afghan</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Later when Talibans, the more purified force of fanatic
                  Mullahs, took over the whole Afghanistan from the
                  moderate/socialistic forces of Afghanistan—Taliban fanatics
                  truly believed that this victory definitely had to do with
                  divine intervention by Merciful Allah. Their fanatic zeal was
                  further energized tremendously by the Prophetic representation
                  by the pure Arab Muslim Maulana Osama bin Laden.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Mr. bin Laden’s joining with Afghan Talibans was seen
                  parallel to the 7<sup>th</sup> century leadership of Prophet
                  Muhammad with those Arab Bedouins in Medina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Their triumphant victory against the Soviet and the
                  Afghan socialistic forces was seen as the good comparison with
                  the victory of Prophet Muhammad against Arab pagan forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Osama bin Laden clearly spelled this idea in his <i>fatwas</i>
                  (called bin Laden’s fatwa) issues for his <i>Al-Qaeda</i>
                  disciples in 1996.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
                  was at that time that Afghan Talibans coupled with bin
                  Laden’s fanatic zeal started to dream of spreading/exporting
                  Jihadist Islamic ideals throughout the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>They perceived the Soviet’s demise as the signal from
                  Merciful Allah to conquer and spread Islamic <i>Shariat </i>to
                  the whole world including America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>They selected the difficult terrain of Afghanistan as
                  the breeding ground of the new generation of fierce Islamic
                  soldiers, who will conquer whole world—thus fulfilling the
                  Koranic injunction given by Prophet Muhammad.&nbsp;<O:P>
                  </O:P>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">In many recent interviews with the
                  western reporters, bin Laden openly asserted this belief in
                  Allah’s assistance in his struggle against infidel America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>He and his <i>Al-Qaeda </i>strongly believed in the
                  unseen delivery of Allah’s assistance in their Holy
                  struggle, and they all were in very strong dream and illusions
                  of this Islamic Myth, i.e., Allah’s unfailing assistance in
                  their struggle against American infidels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>And this particular strong but idiotic belief system
                  made them so daring, dangerous and callous in front of the
                  well-known challenge from the only mighty superpower America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span><b>They simply declared “Holy War” (<i>Jihad</i>)
                  against the infidels and gave a clarion call to all Muslims of
                  the world to joint in their “Holy <i>Jihad</i>” against
                  the infidels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></b>Therefore,
                  many young pure Muslims from Arab, Pakistan, Chechnya and
                  other Muslim countries deliberately and cheerfully joined this
                  holy party of <i>Al-Qaeda</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Like those fanatic Bedouin Arab disciples of Prophet
                  Muhammad in their Islamic Jihad in 7<sup>th</sup> century, Al-Qaeda
                  fanatics had no fear of death whatsoever. They had death wish
                  to become martyred to reach the Seventh Heaven (Islamic
                  special paradise of <i>Zannat Al-Firdous</i>) to enjoy
                  unlimited sex with paragon celestial wide-eyed houries.&nbsp;<O:P>

                  in a strong delusion that, Allah’s mercy is on it’s way,
                  coming soon from the heaven! Mullah Muhammad Omar, the supreme
                  leader of Talibans who was interviewed (during the week of
                  November 12,2001) by BBC said: “<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">This
                  is not a matter of weapons, we are hopeful for Allah’s help.
                  The real matter is the extinction of America…this is my
                  prediction. You believe it or not—it’s up to you.” </i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b>Anybody
                  who listened the Taliban’s press release on November 20,
                  2001 could hear the same assertive hope and dream of Taliban
                  leader and his <i>Jihadi</i> followers desperately gathered in
                  Kandahar. Their hope still is “Allah’s help is coming from
                  the Above as the Ababil birds. They will throw stones over the
                  heads of Northern Alliance soldiers and on American soldiers.

                  compel Talibans to fight until we are alive to secure our
                  religion. Our Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) faced the same temporary

                  <p class="MsoNormal">As I alluded to earlier, war game is the
                  game of weapons-superiority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Historically, one civilization conquered another
                  civilization mainly by their weapon-superiority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>The fact of the matter is, there was no divinity or
                  divine intervention for anybody, or any nations who won the
                  war over the other. It was the superiority of weapons coupled
                  with National unity, good cause and inspirations among the
                  worriers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Islamic
                  Prophet conquered disunited and demoralized pagans by the
                  united Arab Bedouins with their strong fanatic religious zeal,
                  and not because of any kind of divine intervention, so to
                  speak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the
                  success of Arab imperialism sparked by the name of religion
                  Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prophet
                  Muhammad was clever enough to brainwash those half-civilized
                  Arab Bedouins by luring them with worldly profit of booty
                  (wealth’s, women, unlimited sex, etc) and, of course, with
                  the heavenly pleasures of celestial Houries, unlimited sex,
                  wine, honey and bird’s meat after death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Coming of <i>Ababil</i> birds from heaven with stone
                  was simply one of those Arab folklores conveniently used by
                  the Prophet just to mesmerize Arab illiterate Bedouins.&nbsp;<O:P>

                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">The problem however is our millions of
                  close-minded Muslims who still like to have comfort believing
                  such hoax of Islam. The demise of this incogitant Islamic myth
                  is very urgent to protect our civilization from the false and
                  illusionary religious zealotry of those mad fanatic Islamists.
                  The sooner those Muslims get the education that these are
                  merely myths and superstitions of Islam, the better off these
