  <h1><span style="color: black; background-color: #FFFF00"><font size="4">How 
  mountain is formed? </font></span></h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Geology teaches us that 
  movement of tectonic plates, volcanic force or earthquake itself causes 
  mountains to be formed. </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Plate Tectonic 
  changes are responsible for terrestrial ocean basins continents or mountains 
  formation. Earthquake and volcanic eruptions creating pressure to compress 
  Earth’s crustal rocks to form mountains. Fault zones tend be the source of 
  earthquake. And tectonic plate movements shape continents, form mountains and 
  generate the volcanism that continually renews the ocean floors. If some 
  crustal plates are separating or rifting by the formation of a new oceanic 
  crust, there must be other places on the planet where plates are crunching 
  together. At such boundaries—tectonic plates can collide which can lift up the 
  land to make a giant mountain. </span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><tt style="font-family: Courier New">
  <span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">
  The highest mountain, like Himalayan range was formed when the Indian plate 
  collided with the Asian plate around 250 million years ago. It is believed 
  that India was connected with </span>
  <span style="font-size:12.0pt;
 font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">Antarctica</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black"> 
  and Australia about 300 million years ago. Then the plate separated and the 
  Indian continent started drifting northwards. When it collided with the Asian 
  plate the sea level rose and the mountain range formed from the bottom of the 
  sea. The evidence is that high at the top of Himalayan the geologists have 
  discovered fossils of sea creatures. The other truth is that the Himalayan is 
  the youngest mountain range in the world. It is not finished yet--the&nbsp;height 
  of Himalayan Mountain peaks are still raising. The question of providing 
  stability does not arise at all.</span></tt></p>
  <h6><span style="font-weight: 400">Truth of the matter is, all mountains had 
  been formed by shaking of this earth in the first place, and i.e. mountain <u>
  could not be</u> formed/born without severe shaking of this planet earth, 
  period. <span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Besides, we know very well that, every 
  year several dozens of earthquakes happen on earth. Then what is the result of 
  Allah’s promise? Can we believe that, Mountains are there to prevent 
  earthquake? Then why thousands of earthquakes happen every century? </span>

  <span style="color: black">Mountains are never viewed as the stabilizing 
  factors. I never heard or read that any world famous geologist ever claimed 
  that mountains help earth to stabilize or mountain prevents earth from 
  moving/shaking. Actually Mountains are the source of earth’s shaking.<i> </i>
  Their formation caused and still causes the surface of the earth to shake<i>.</i> 
  Where there are more mountains, there are more earthquakes and more shaking of 
  the planet earth. Any country that has many mountains definitely have many 
  volcanoes and volcanic eruptions normally give rise many earthquakes every 
  year. Consider the earthquake zones of earth. Earthquakes happen 'all the 
  time' and they are concentrated along </span><span style="color: red">specific 
  zones, in which mountainous areas</span><span style="color: black"> are also 
  concentrated. Therefore, claims that mountains are firm and immovable is 
  simply ridiculous and utter lie. Besides, mountains on earth are not 
  proportionally or uniformly distributed every where, i. e. in some areas there 
  are many mountains, on the other area there are no mountains at all. </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph">The Earth itself is 
  revolving about the Sun; Sun and its planets are revolving about our Milky Way 
  galaxy; The Milky Way galaxy is again moving around the center of the Local 
  Group of Galaxies.... etc. So mountains cannot be considered as &quot;immoveable&quot; 
  as the whole universe is moving. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Besides, the planet Earth 
  of ours is the result of billions of years of continuous evolutionary 
  transformation. This planet earth has undergone series of geological change 
  for hundreds of millions of years. There was time when all these continents 
  were together and later they were separated from each other, perhaps
  <span style="color:red">that episode caused severe/terrible</span>
  <span style="color:red">shaking of the earth</span>. Himalayas</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"> were formed when the Indian subcontinent bumps against the Asian plate 
  causing tremendous shaking of this earth. Then why Allah talked about the 
  nonsense of creating mountain to prevent shaking of the earth? Did not the 
  process of creation of </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Himalayas occur 
  much after the original creation of this earth by merciful Allah? &nbsp;Why did He 
  lie with Prophet Muhammad that He (Allah) created mountains to prevent shaking

  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;When modern science and 
  modern consensus tell us that shaking of the earth is directly related with 
  the presence of mountains and volcanoes in that locality some wishful 
  Islamists claim that actually mountains are there to stop shaking of earth! 
  How is it possible? Let me tell you how it is possible. These so called 
  Islamic intellectuals when dealing religion, Koran and Allah—they immediately 
  lose their all intellects, common sense, and become Allah’s robot only to 
  achieve their ludicrous lustrous life after death. They vow to protect Allah’s 
  Koranic garbage at the cost of their civil and intellectual norms and they 
  start talking all nonsense just to make Allah’s garbage some what meaningful 
  to the readers. They even forget that their weird logic will not be able to 
  convince anybody who is a sensible person and not blinded with faith. Yet they 
  continue to do so only to get lustrous heaven and to save their skin from the 
  hell fire!</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">This Islamist used some
