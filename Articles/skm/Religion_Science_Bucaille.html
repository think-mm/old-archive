                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </i></b>
                  <p>Maurice Bucaille in his dishonest attempt tried to
                  establish science in Quran. I myself read the book written by
                  Maurice Bucaile, but could not agree with him at all. I have
                  no clue why Islamists dishonestly claim science in Quran!
                  There are serious scientific problems when Muslim apologists
                  attempt to claim the presence of authentic scientific theories
                  in Qur'an. For 1300 years, Muslim mullahs, Maulanas, Qur'ane
                  Hafez etc. could not see any scientific theory in Qur'an. I
                  never heard that before. It was only in eighties suddenly we
                  heard some mullahs are widely disseminating the EUREKA' of
                  Quranic science<b><i>.</p>
                  </i>
                  <p>Why, Who and Where?</p>
                  </b>
                  <p>All Mullahs are pointing their fingers to one person- <b>Maurice
                  Bucaille</b>. We are sick and tired of hearing about Maurice
                  Bucaille again and again. Who is this Maurice Bucaille? I will
                  answer this question later in this essay. In early eighties, I
                  talked to one Islamic scholar (for privacy his name will be
                  kept secrete) who is mastered in three languages (Bengali,
                  English and Arabic). He thoroughly read and memorized entire
                  Qur'an. I asked him if there was any real scientific theory in
                  Qur'an. He answered, &quot;No, there is nothing that we can
                  call it a theory of science.&quot; I asked him if there is any
                  medicine given by God in Qur'an. He answered, <i>&quot; Not
                  really, only medicine we can think about is the HONEY</i>.&quot;
                  Then, in the mean time, on hearing mullahs hue &amp; cry'
                  about that Bucaille's <b>EUREKA</b>, I asked the same Islamic
                  Scholar the same questions I asked him before. To my
                  astonishment, this time his answer was quite different. He
                  said, yes there are scientific theories in Qur'an and then he
                  suggested me to read the book written by Maurice Bucaille.
                  Then I read this book of Maurice Bucaille in English and in
                  Bengali (translated by Akhterul Alam) couple of times. Then I
                  read Qur'an entirely several times (both in English and in
                  Bengali). Alas! I found nothing in the Qur'an that should be
                  termed as science. Unfortunately, I could not agree myself
                  with even one word that Dr. Bucaille tried to explain with his
                  wishful thinking. <b>Not because I did not like to agree, but
                  could not agree, because of clear &amp; fundamental flaws in
                  his quest of matching things with modern science</b>. Maurice
                  Bucaille, not only tried to make ‘Ka' as Kalikatta, but he
                  also some times made ‘Ka' as Bombay, Madras, Delhi etc. in
                  his wishful quest of matching science.</p>
                  <p>Yes, there are verses that tried to answer some questions
                  belonged to science mainly: Embryological and Astronomical
                  field. Because, 7<sup>th</sup> Century people must have asked
                  about the mystery of creation of human beings, Earth, Sun,
                  moon, Stars etc. BUT, were those answers/theories fit present
                  day science? <b>Maurice Bucaille said it fits, so it fits for</b>
                  <b>sure</b>! Maurice Bucaille said, &quot;I could not find a
                  single error in the Qur'anic scientific theories&quot;, so
                  there is no error in Qur'anic sciences, and World has to
                  believe it?</p>
                  <p>Actually, what I found and other scientists found are: <b>Qur'anic
                  scientific verses matches with Aristotle and Galenic theories
                  of Embryology and Ptolemic Geo-centric theorie of Astronomy
                  which were prevailing almost thousand years before the arrival
                  of Qur'an.<i> </i>HOWEVER, ALLTHESE THEORIES WERE PROVEN
                  MOSTLY WRONG BY MOEDRN SCIENCE TODAY.</p>

                  <p>Who was Maurice Bucaille? Was he a world famous scientist?
                  Or, Was he a Nobel laureate? Or, was he an authority in
                  theology, Embryology, or Astronomical science? <b>ANSWER IS
                  NONE OF THE ABOVE</b>. Maurice Bucaillle was an ordinary
                  French Physician and lived in Saudi Arabia as an expatriate
                  doctor to Saudi King Family. He was not a better doctor than
                  any of those hundreds of Bangladeshi or Indian expatriate
                  Physicians working in Saudi Arabia. But because, he was the
                  Physician for Saudi King Family he developed a special
                  relation with Saudi King. To keep Dharma Bebosha' (religious
                  trade) booming, Saudi king asked him to write a book
                  highlighting Qur'anic science for which the King <b>offered
                  him $6 million dollars</b>. Clever French Doctor wrote the
                  book &quot;<b>The Bible, The Quran and Science</b>&quot;, got
                  $ 6 millions (from the Saudi King) and got another $ 2
                  millions by selling his book (according to Dr. Campbell). This
                  book was sold in Islamic World like a hot cake. <b><font color="#ff0000">It
                  was told that, this doctor distorted the actual translation of
                  Holy Qur'an by intentional/selective choosing of various
                  meanings of Arabic words in order to match his theory of

                  <p>Who is Dr. William F. Campbell? William Campbell is an
                  American Physician who was an expatriate doctor for the family
                  of the King of Tunisia for 20 years. After learning about the
                  book of Dr. Bucaille, he wrote a book of 300 pages <b>categorically
                  rebutting</b> Dr. Bucaille's book. I urge readers to read Dr.
                  Campbell's book and see for themselves.</p>

                  <p>SCIENCE IS NOT PROPERTY OF ANY RELIGION</p>
                  </u></b>
                  <p>No Religion (Islam, Christian, Judaism, Hinduism etc.) can
                  claim Science as their property. Religion should never claim
                  any credit whatsoever, for the advancement of science.
                  Einstein was a great scientist because of his own quality, not
                  because of his Judaism. Ibne sinna was a scientist by virtue
                  of his quality and not because he was a son of Muslim. Al-Razi
                  was the greatest freethinker and greatest scientist not
                  because he was a son of Muslim, but by virtue of his
                  freethinking quality. Galileo was a great scientist by his
                  knowledge and perseverance, and not because he was a son of
                  Christian. During the reign of General Ziaul Hoque of
                  Pakistan, this ultra Islamic General in his bid to turn the
                  Country's clock backward, he established one Academy known as
                  ISLAMIC SCIENCE ACADEMY. There he invited all Muslim
                  &quot;educated ignorant&quot; scientists (Gun-pappi) to
                  illustrate Qur'anic sciences. To see this madness (Pagla'mi)
                  of this fanatic General, Dr. Parvez Hoodboy (<b>M.I.T.
                  educated Nuclear Physicist</b>) wrote a book ridiculing
                  Islamic Science Academy's caricature with pure science. In
                  this book's forwarding letter, Pakistani Nobel laureate
                  Physicist <b>DR. ABDUS SALAM</b> wrote: <b>&quot;<font color="#ff0000">There
                  is only one Universal Science ; its problems and modalities
                  are international and there is no such thing as Islamic
                  Science just as there is no Hindu Science, nor Jewish Science,
                  no Confucian Science, nor Christian Science&quot;.</p>
                  </font></b>
                  <p>Was Dr. Bucaille a greater scientist than Dr. Abdus Salam?
                  Many Muslims sometimes claim/mention the names of Arab-Muslim
                  scientist's achievement but they fail to mention from whom
                  scientific knowledge were carried over to those Arab
                  Nationals. I do not consider these Arab Muslim scientists as
                  Mullah. <b>Mullahs with their utter closed mindsets can never
                  be a scientist</b>. Nobel laureate Dr. Abdus Salam was not a
                  Mullah. Among those ancient Muslim scientists, most of them
                  were secular-freethinkers, and many of them were non-Arab
                  (Central Asian) Muslims. Quite obviously they did not get
                  science from the Religion. BECAUSE RELIGION AND SCIENCE IS
                  LIKE OIL AND WATER, NEVER CAN MIX TOGETHER. History does not
                  testify that any of those Arab scientists got scientific
                  theory from Quran at all. Lots of scientists lost their lives
                  for telling the truth. Even today, Religion is like a clutch
                  in the neck of Science, and frequently tries to stop
                  advancement of science. Religious Orthodoxy always confronts
                  Science. For the last 100 years or so, biological science
                  galloping advancement is purely on the basis <b>of EVOLUTION
                  THEORY OF Darwin and definitely not on the basis of CREATION
                  THEORY of Religion<i>. </i><font color="#ff0000">Science does

                  correct folks?</p>
                  <p>Truth is, if Religion wants to mix-up with evolution then,
                  we shall have to consider Adam as Ape-like Neanderthal or
                  Homo-erectus early human, and not a perfect human having all

                  <p>In the early 1980s, Prof. Keith Moore, formerly an
                  anatomist at the University of Toronto, Canada produced a
                  special edition of his embryology textbook, known as ‘<i>T<b>he
                  Islamic edition’</b></i> which was available only in some
                  Middle Eastern Countries. Critics think, he wrote this Islamic
                  version of his book to make quick money by selling it to the
                  Islamic world. This Islamic edition is not available in the
                  western world presumably because he is aware that not only do
                  the Islamic contributions in it contradict known science, but
                  they also contradict what he has written in the standard
                  version of his text book. However, his standard version of
                  embryology text book has been widely used in medical schools
                  of the west</p>

                  <b><u><font color="#ff0000">
                  <p>Man are created from Clotted blood ?</p>
                  </font></u></b>
                  <p>Quran-23:14: Then fashioned We the drop (semen) a <b>CLOT,</b>
                  then fashioned We the Clot a little lump, fashioned We the
                  little lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and
                  then produced it another creation. So blessed be Allah, the
                  Best of Creators.</p>
                  <p>Quran-75:38: Then he becomes a <b>CLOT</b>; then (Allah)
                  shaped and fashioned…</p>
                  <p>Quran-96:2: Created man, out of a mere <b>clot</b> of
                  congealed blood</p>
                  <b><i>
                  <p>Blood clot can not grow into anything</i></b>. This idea
                  also came from the Greek. <b>Aristotle</b> erroneously
                  believed that, humans are originated from the action of male
                  semen upon female menstrual blood which is absolutely an
                  incorrect assumption. Quran’s assertion on <b><font color="#ff0000">Clot
                  (alaqa</font></b>) is completely wrong about human
                  development, since there is absolutely no stage during which
                  the embryo consists of a clot. The only situation in which an
                  embryo might appear like a clot is during a miscarriage, in
                  which case the clotted blood which is seen to emerge (much of
                  which comes from mother) is solidified and by definition no
                  longer alive. Therefore, if ever an embryo appeared to <b>look
                  like a clot</b> it would never develop any further into a
                  human; it would <b><font color="#ff0000">be a dead mass</font></b>
                  of bloody miscarrying flesh. Since Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) had
                  some thirteen wives it is entirely possible that he would be
                  very familiar with miscarriages.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p>Modern science tells us that, the formation of human embryo
                  is a seamless continuation from conception to birth; hence
                  there is no hard- and- fast boundary of stages as Quran
                  described. Quran described 4 stages which matches exactly with
                  Galenic description of development of human embryo.</p>

                  <p>EVOLUTION:</p>
                  </u>
                  <p>Some Islamists often try to ridicule about evolution in
                  order to protect the obvious fallacies of the creation theory
                  of religion. EVOLUTION is the greatest triumphs of human
                  discovery. Evolution is not a peripheral subject but the
                  central organizing principle of all biological science. So no
                  one ignorant of evolution can understand science. Secondly,
                  evolution is as well documented as any phenomenon in science,
                  as strongly as the Earth's revolution around the sun rather
                  than vice versa. Therefore, we can call evolution a
                  &quot;Fact&quot;. Today’s biological sciences are directly
                  propagating on the basis of evolution theory of Darwin.
                  Without believing in evolution one can not understand and
                  agree with the modern miracles of organ transplanting, test
                  tube bay, cloning, and sperm cells/eggs making from stem
                  cells.</p>
                  <u>
                  <p>Life from WATER</u></b>:</p>
                  <p>Hindu Religious book Veda' (8000 B. C.) described origin of
                  Earth and life from WATER of the SEA. The Great Greek
                  Philosopher and Scientist THALES (640-546 B. C.) was the first
                  Humankind who theorized that, <b><i>everything in this
                  Universe was created from WATER OF THE SEA. </i>Problem was,
                  Thales could not provide any scientific proof. After that,
                  ARISTOTLE (384-322 B.C. the pupil of Plato and Tutor of
                  Alexander the Great) concluded: &quot;Because of the fact
                  that, Plants &amp; Animal body contains plenty of WATER and
                  life needs WATER that was why THALES thought WATER WAS THE
                  ORIGIN OF LIFE&quot;. Therefore, Mankind did not have to wait
                  until 7<sup>th</sup> Century for Allah to say importance of
                  WATER for life.</p>

                  <p>HONEY:</p>
                  </u>
                  <p>Wish full Islamists demand that Quran predicted Honey as
                  the good medicine. Honey although it is not a great medicine
                  by today's context, was used by Ancient people as medicine and
                  food for tens of thousands of years. Physicians of Pharaoh
                  King used to prescribe Honey for diseases. In pre-Islamic
                  Arab, PAGANS used to use HONEY widely as medicine. In India,
                  Ayurbedic medicine widely used HONEY as the ingredients of
                  medicine <u>thousands of years</u> before the arrival of
                  Qur'an. Honey was known as Grandma's Medicine' throughout the
                  Ancient World for thousands of years.<u></p>
