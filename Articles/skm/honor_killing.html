    H</font></b>onor killings, which occur with shocking regularity in certain 
	parts of the Middle East and South Asia, target women whose actions – actual 
	or suspected – violate the honor of their family, an honor which is thought 
	to depend on the sexual purity of its female members. Victims are always 
	being killed/slaughtered mercilessly by her own family members. Honor 
	killing is a manifestation of global phenomenon in general and Muslim 
	nations in particular. Since this terrible inhumane practice does exists 
	only among the Muslims of the world—very often civilized people do blame 
	Islam as the precursor of this dreadful act.&nbsp; Most others do not agree 
	with this notion at all; and they try to put the blame on the 
	tribal/cultural practice, and do not consider Islam is anyway responsible 
	for it. In this essay I shall analyze the real issues, cause and origin, and 
	pattern of this heinous act amongst the Muslims of the world to postulate if 
	there is any link, or incitements that originates from the very core of 
	Islam. </font>
  </p>
  <p class="textpadding" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="textpadding" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><u>What is 
	honor killing?</u></b></font></p>
  <p class="textpadding" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="textpadding" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Honor killing is 
	the bone chilling horrific cruelty committed by the family members—father, 
	mother, brothers, brother-in-laws, even in some cases own sisters also.&nbsp; 
	In this terrible episode the victim is always the <b>daughter/sister</b> or 
	other blood related young women who get killed. <b>Perpetrators are always 
	the family members stated above</b>. Family honor is one of the core values 
	of Arab society. Anything from speaking with an unrelated man, to rumored 
	pre-marital loss of virginity, to an extra-marital affair, refuses forced 
	marriages; marry according to their will; or even women and girls who have 
	been raped—can stain or destroy the family honor. Therefore, family members 
	(parents, brothers, or sisters) kill the victim in order to remove the stain 
	or maintain, and protect the honor of the family. Killers are given light 
	sentences, sometimes with little or no jail time at all. The killers mainly 
	defend their act of murder <b>by referring to the Koran and Islam</b>. 
	Family guardian will say that they are merely following the directives set 
	down in their Islamic ethical beliefs.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">These barbaric 
	killings occur only to save the honor of the family, <u>and not for any 
	animosity or for wealth or gold</u>. In 100% of cases—the killers have no 
	animosity, rather they love the girl as their own daughter or sister, but 
	they kill the girl anyway upon their ethical compulsion to save their family 
	honor, or to erase family stigmas. The victims cry, beg for their life but 
	the family members become merciless (out of their ethical prejudices and 
	also religious burden of fear) and kill the victim. <b>After killing family 
	members usually mourn and cry for the victim (usually loving daughter or 
	sister) but feel solace that they have done the right thing to save their 
	family honor.&nbsp; </b>
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">And this kind of 
	cruel killings to save family honor had happened, still happening, and will 
	remain to happen—<b><u>only to a Muslim family</u></b>. Honor killings 
	happen only to some designated Muslim nations such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, 
	Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, Sudan, the Gaza strip and the West Bank 
	(Palestine), Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Somalia, 
	Turkey, Iran and some other south and central Asian countries. Bangladesh 
	though a Muslim majority country—regular pattern of honor killings never 
	happened as of today. But it is not unknown or impossible to record some 
	stray incidences in Bangladeshi rural Muslim family (only) in which girl was 
	poisoned by family members, or asked to commit suicide after being 
	impregnated by unwed sexual intercourse.&nbsp; However, this same kind of 
	case history was never heard, or recorded in the non-Muslim family of 
	Bangladesh.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><u>Honor 
	killing is different from other killings.</u></b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Honor killing should 
	never be confused with wife beating, or wife killings by husbands or other 
	relatives. Since pre-historic ancient time people assassinated, killed, or 
	poisoned their wives or husbands, or other family members for either 
	adultery, love affairs (<i>Poro-keya prem)</i> with other man besides her 
	husband, or for property disputes—and these are simple <b>homicide</b> in 
	English terminology.&nbsp; <b>They are never called honor killing</b>.&nbsp; 
	This kind of homicides did occur, still occurs, and will occur in any 
	nations, or race throughout the human history and these are not any race, or 
	religion related happenings by any standard. Honor killings also should 
	never be confused, or mixed up with killings for dowry, acid throwing by 
	unsuccessful/disappointed love stalkers (as frequently happened in the 
	Indian sub-continent), or any other violence against women. These are simply <b>
	not honor killings</b>, which is the topic of this essay.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><u>Some sample 
	cases of horrific honor killing:&nbsp; </u></b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Case-1</b>: &quot; Two 
	months ago, when she tried to run away yet again, Kina (father of the girl) 
	grabbed a kitchen knife and an ax and stabbed and beat the girl [<b>his 
	daughter</b>] until she lay dead in the blood-smeared bathroom of the 
	family's Istanbul apartment. He then commanded one of his daughters-in-law 
	to clean up the mess. When his two sons came home from work 14 hours later, 
	he ordered them to dispose of the 5-foot-3 corpse, which had been wrapped in 
	a carpet and a blanket. The girl's head had been so mutilated, police said, 
	it was held together by a knotted cloth.&quot; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Case-2</b>: 
	&quot;Kifaya Husayn, a 16-year-old Jordanian girl, was lashed to a chair by her 
	32-year-old brother. He gave her a drink of water and told her to recite an 
	Islamic prayer. Then he slashed her throat. Immediately afterward, he ran 
	out into the street, waving the bloody knife and crying, <b>'I have killed 
	my sister to cleanse my honor</b>.' Kifaya's crime? She was raped by another 
	brother, a 21-year-old man. Her judge and jury? Her own uncles, who 
	convinced her eldest brother that Kifaya was too much of a disgrace to the 
	family's honor to be allowed to live. The murderer was sentenced to fifteen 
	years, but the sentence was subsequently reduced to seven and a half years, 
	an extremely severe penalty by Jordanian standards.&quot; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Case-3:</b>&nbsp; 
	“A 25-year-old Palestinian who hanged his sister with a rope: &quot;I did not 
	kill her, but rather helped her to commit suicide and to carry out the death 
	penalty she sentenced herself to. <b>I did it to wash with her blood the 
	family honor</b> that was violated because of her and in response to the 
	will of society that would not have had any mercy on me if I didn't . . . 
	Society taught us from childhood that blood is the only solution to wash the 
	honor.&quot;
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Case-4</b>: 
	&quot;Samia Sarwar, 29, mother of two boys aged 4 and 8, was shot dead today in 
	lawyer Hina Jillani's office by a bearded man accompanying her mother and 
	uncle. `He's my helper, I can't walk,' said the mother, when Hina told the 
	two men to get out. As the mother went to sit down in front of Hina's desk, 
	and Saima stood up from her chair, the bearded man whipped out a pistol from 
	his waistcoat and shot Saima in the head, killing her instantly.&quot; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Case-5:</b> ABU QASH, Palestine:&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Amira Abu Hanhan Qaoud (mother of 9 children) killed her daughter ‘Rofayda 
	Qaoud’ who had been raped by her brothers and was impregnated. Armed with a 
	plastic bag, razor and wooden stick, Qaoud entered her sleeping daughter's 
	room last Jan. 27, 2003. &quot;Tonight you die, Rofayda,&quot; she told the girl, 
	before wrapping the bag tightly around her head. Next, Qaoud sliced 
	Rofayda's wrists, ignoring her muffled pleas of &quot;No, mother, no!&quot; After her 
	daughter went limp, Qaoud struck her in the head with the stick. The 
	43-year-old mother of nine said. &quot;I had to protect my children. This is the 
	only way I could protect my family's honor.&quot; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Case-6:</b> A 23 year old Rania 
	Arafat, whose plight was broadcast live on national TV in Jordan. Rania was 
	promised to her cousin as a very young child. Rania repeatedly told that she 
	doesn't love him and she is in love with someone else. She pled with her 
	family to allow her to marry her lover, instead. She ran away twice, 
	including two weeks before her forced marriage. She wrote to her mother and 
	pled for forgiveness and understanding. <b>Her parents promised that she 
	would not be harmed and she could return home</b>. On August 19, 1997, Rania 
	returned home. The same night, her younger brother, Rami, shot her five 
	times in the head and chest, killing her immediately. Her youngest brother 
	was chosen to commit the murder not only to allow his defense to find 
	protection under the laws protecting so-called honour crimes, but also 
	because he was a juvenile. Rami served six months in jail for his crime.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Case-7:</b>&nbsp; Amal, another 
	Arab woman and victim of honour killing was run away because she insisted on 
	her independence. Her family said that they were ashamed because of that and 
	the gossip of neighbors. One night, when she returned home and went sleep, 
	her brother accompanied by Amal's father, strangled her. He said: &quot;I 
	strangled her. She didn't fight back. <b>I recited the &quot;Holly Koran</b>&quot; as 
	she was dying… it took a few minutes and she was dead.&quot; He and his father 
	both given light sentences.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><u>Honor killing 
	is a cultural/tribal phenomenon!!! </u></b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Most Muslim 
	apologists and also some gullible westerners want to argue that the ‘so 
	called “honor killing” is not Islamic and it’s a tribal/cultural vice.’&nbsp; <b>
	This statement is</b> <b>utterly untrue and only a wish full covers up</b>.&nbsp; 
	It’s true that in pre-Islamic Arab culture this heinous honor killing of 
	women did exist; likewise, many other uncivilized practices like stoning, 
	flogging, beheading, slavery etc also existed in the pre-Islamic Arab 
	society. But Islam did incorporate entirely most of these 
	inhumane/uncivilized practices of pagan society, which they now call them 
	Allah’s laws. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Had it been the 
	tribal/cultural practice, ‘honor killing’ would exist amongst the Arabs 
	only. But honor killing does happen amongst the non-Arab Muslims also.&nbsp; 
	Also Arabs belonged to all religions (Muslims, Christians, Jews, Bhai etc.) 
	would practice honor killing with equal prevalence. Fact of the matter is—no 
	Arab Christians, Jews or Bahai etc do practice this uncivilized act at all.&nbsp; 
	Only
  <b><u>Arab Muslims</u></b> do practice this heinous act with a regular 
	pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Honor killing does 
	happen only amongst the Muslims and these honor killings get support and 
	encouragement from the ethical teachings of religion Islam.&nbsp; In 1986 
	this kind of honor killing did happen in the United States of America in an 
	Arab Muslim family. In 2003 honor killing happened in Sweden again in a 
	Muslim family.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, some very rare, sporadic case of such 
	killing might have happened in other society or people of other religion. 
	But they are no where near to compare with the regular pattern, or routine 
	feature of honor killings which do happen in the Muslim nations that I have 
	mentioned.&nbsp; It has been reported that in Pakistan and in Jordan several 
	hundreds of “honor killings” do happen every year.&nbsp; Perhaps, it will be 
	more plausible to name this so called ‘<b>honor’</b> 
  as the “<b>Islamic honor</b>”, which Muslims stupendously try to save!&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above Quranic 
	verses and authentic sahih hadiths clearly demonstrate beyond doubt that 
	Prophet Muhammad, under Allah’s direction, stoned adulterers to death and 
	flogged fornicators. Allah’s decree/choice of death for fornicators (Quran: 
	4:15) and flogging adulteress 100 times with no mercy (Quran: 24:2, which 
	also could lead to certain death) has clearly sanctioned/dictated <b>
	dreadful punishment for sexual intercourse</b> outside marriage. It is from 
	these scriptural divine spirits Iranian fundamentalist Islamic government 
	practices stoning and flogging adulterers even today. The Iranian Supreme 
	Court sanctioned that an adulteress should be buried up to her chest and 
	stoned to death.&nbsp; Mullahs of Iran know the hadiths quite well. This 
	august body is closely following Allah’s prophet. It is also quite prudent 
	to consider that Muslim parents those who are practicing honor killing are <b>
	directly motivated, or influenced </b>by the above scriptural and historical 
	(Hadiths) support; hence they are able to commit heinous crime called ‘honor 
	killing’ with (almost) impunity, exultantly and with ample satisfaction that 
	they are following the strict Islamic ethical code to guard chastity, as the 
	holy Prophet repeatedly cautioned Muslims so seriously to guard their 
	women’s chastity. </font></p>

	the Islamic style. As per Islamic justice—unmarried fornicators receive a

	it has often been conjoined in the Qur’an with the gravest of all sins: <b><i>
  shirk</i> </b>or associating partners with Allah.</font></p>

	stated, “Islam has taken a firm and decisive stance against <i>Zina</i> 
  (fornication or adultery). Allah, the Almighty, commands in explicit and 
	unequivocal words: <b>“And come not near unto adultery. Lo! it is an 
	abomination and an evil way.”</b> (Al-Isra’: 32).”<br>
  <br>
  <b>Mufti Muhammad Aashiq Illahi Muhajir Madani</b> (<i>Illuminating Discourses 
	on the Noble Qur’an</i>, Karachi, Pakistan, Zam Zam, 2003) also follows this 
	tactic of describing society that does not undergo Islamic punishments for 
	the two sexual crimes. Families fall into ruin, which means society also is 
	ruined. Sexual sins also cause widespread disease (vol. 6, pp. 360-66). </font>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;Al Skudsi bin 
	Hookah</b>, (roving reporter and foreign correspondent for <i>The Gaza

	are not fighting back. Deep down, we know that when a woman has disgraced 
	her family, nothing will restore honor <b>except by killing her</b>. This is 
	understood in Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt, the Gaza strip and the 
	West Bank. So why are we Arabs telling the Western press that honor killing 
	is cultural, that it is not really part of Islam? Our way of life is based 
	on maintaining our honor. And make no mistake about it: a woman does tarnish 
	her family's honor by engaging in pre-marital sex, or by getting herself 
	raped, when she seeks divorce and when she marries against her family's 
	wishes. And keeping our women pure is a big part of our honor. So there's no 
	point saying honor killing isn't really part of our religion. Honor and 
	Islam are inextricably bound; they are what give our life meaning. A strong 
	religion demands we choose to maintain our honor.” </font></p>

	(A Jordanian with an American doctorate who spent 12 years as a hospital

	marriage.&quot; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><u>Status of 
	Women in Muslim society:</u></b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><u>&nbsp;</u></b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to Islamic 
	tradition the woman is an object owned by the man who assumes responsibility 
	for her behavior and her life. The social and religious traditions lead to 
	the isolation of the woman in her home. She is required to cover her entire 
	body in order to maintain the honor of the man. In Qur’an, prophetic 
	tradition and law, one finds a very strong presumption of <b>women’s 
	chastity</b> along with numerous safeguards to prevent any imputation of 
	un-chastity &nbsp;&nbsp;A Muslim feminist sexual ethics must help create the 
	conditions for the <b>Qur’anic and traditional values of modesty and 
	chastity</b> to be lived by Muslim women and men in ways that are faithfully 
	chosen and equitably maintained.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">A woman who is 
	either raped or commits adultery becomes the source of shame to her family. 
	People will not marry her because she has been spoiled; she and her family 
	becomes the object of gossip of everyone in the society; hence the entire 
	family can lose prestige. No one would give a daughter to the brothers of 
	that girl in marriage and no one would marry her sisters. The family and 
	even the extended family are maligned and become outcasts. This can only 
	stop if the family cleanses that stain with blood. The woman thus defiled 
	must be killed even if she is a victim of rape. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><u>Role of 
	Misogynistic attitude in Islam:</u></b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islam is 
	dreadfully anti-women. This statement can be proven with 100% guarantee by 
	the well known and established fact that—women folks in every Muslim country 
	in general, and in every Islamic paradise (<i>country where Islamic Shariaat 
	is enforced</i>) in particular, are severely <b>subjugated, oppressed, and 
	considered less than second class</b> <b>citizen.</b> Women in Islam are 
	considered half human and in the Quran women have half the rights of men, 
	sister has half the rights of brother, and women are considered deficient in 
	intelligence. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Practically and 
	Literally Islam consider women as the sources of great shame. Prophet 
	Muhammad said women are <b><i>awrah</i></b> which can be translated as <b>
	object of shame</b>. What is <b><i>awrah</i>?</b> The Encyclopedia of Islam 
	defines <b>'<i>awrah</i></b>’as pudendum, which is the external genitals, 
	especially of the female.&nbsp;The word<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> 
  Pudendum derives from the Latin <i>pudor</i> which means sense of shame and 
	modesty. </span><b>Therefore, <i>awrah</i> signify an object of shame that 
	needs to be covered.</b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Interestingly, in 
	the Indian sub-continent (Bangladesh-India-Pakistan)—women have another 
	alternative name calling, in spite of having their usual name for the 
	English word woman in the respective language. And this famous name calling 
	is “<b><i>Auraat</i></b>” and common in all the three countries of the 
	Indian sub-continent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously this common word “<b><i>Auraat</i></b>” 
	for women came from the Arabic word <b>
  <i>Awrah</i></b>. This common word <i>“Auraat</i>” is usually used as the 
	synonym for woman with empathy, hatred, mercy and shame. </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to the 
	following Hadiths, women not only have ten <b><i>'awrah</i>,</b> but the 
	woman herself is perceived as <b>'<i>awrah</i>: </b>&nbsp;&quot;The woman is <b><i>
	'awrah.</i></b> 
  When she goes outside (the house), the devil welcomes her&quot; (<i>Ihy'a 'Uloum 
	ed-Din by Ghazali, Dar al-Kotob al-'Elmeyah, Beirut , Vol II, Kitab Adab 
	al-Nikah, p. 65. Reported by Tirmizi as a true and good Ahadith). </i></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot; Hazrat Ali 
	(rightly guided Caliph) reported the Prophet saying: “Women have ten <b><i>
	('awrah)</i></b>. When she gets married, the husband covers one, and when 
	she dies the grave covers the ten.&quot; ( <i>Kanz-el-'Ummal, Vol. 22, Hadith No. 
	858. See also Ihy'a).</i></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In most fanatical 
	Islamic nations when a woman loses her <i>awrah</i> by e.g. through rape, 
	she becomes the object of shame for her entire family, and also for the 
	society. Only way to remove that shame and restore the honor is to remove 
	that defiled woman.&nbsp; It is practiced in most Islamic countries with a 
	regular pattern. The more religious is a country, the more is widespread the 
	honor killing.&nbsp;As for example, Pakistan a Muslim majority nation did not 
	have practice of honor killing until the fanatic and despotic Military 
	dictator General Ziaul Hoq came to power. This despotic ruler by his decade 
	long dictatorship turned Pakistan into an Islamic Sharia country. Along with 
	intense acceleration of making Pakistan into a hub of Talibans, and Islamic 
	terrorist’s country, citizens of Pakistan also started vigorous practicing 
	of honor killing on a regular basis.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b><u>Conclusion:&nbsp;
  </u></b></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Judging everything I 
	have described in this essay, one can very genuinely lead to the conclusion 
	that ‘honor killing’ is indeed the vice of Islam. <b>Islam has much to do 
	with</b>
  <b>honor killing practices which only do exist amongst the Muslims of the 
	world.</b> Had it been un-Islamic practice, we would have seen some Muslim 
	nations prohibiting such cruel practice by Sharia law. We have not seen any 
	Muslim country did enact any such law to curve honor killing. We have seen 
	innumerable cases of fatwas by Mullahs to prohibit alcohol drinking, pork 
	eating or listening western music; but never ever heard any such fatwa 
	against honor killing. Rather, honor killing has silent support from the 
	devout Islamists of all kinds.&nbsp; Islamists condone honor killing 
	silently! No wonder that the Al Skudsi bin Hookah (<i>reported of 
	Gazagejeera</i>) so passionately said<b>: “<i>So there's no point saying 
	honor killing isn't really part of our religion. Honor and Islam are</i></b><i> <b>
	inextricably bound; they are what give our life meaning. A strong religion 
	demands</b></i><b> we choose to maintain our honor.”</b> </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">One may argue that 
	Quran does not say clearly about honor killing! Fact is there are plenty of 
	things Muslims practice that are also not mentioned in the Quran. Stoning 
	death also not available in the Quran. Yet Iranian Islamic government does 
	practice stoning death by the decree of Islamic court. Afghan Taliban 
	government did routinely practice stoning and flogging of adulterers. <b>
	Most importantly, Quran did not create any scriptural</b> <b>instruction to 
	ban the so called Arab tribal practice of “honor killing” either!</b>&nbsp; 
	Besides, if the honor killing was simply a tribal practice—then it would 
	have been prevailed amongst the Arabs of all religions. <b>There is no 
	evidence to support that a Christian or Jewish family of Jordan or Palestine 
	did practice honor killing.</b>&nbsp;
  </font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Muslims who are 
	stunningly devout and laden with Islamic superstitious beliefs do commit 
	crime of Honor killing to fulfill their obligation of preserving Islamic 
	ethics, and women chastity. The more a country gets fanatically religious 
	the more frequent are honor killings (Pakistan is a perfect example). Islam 
	has incorporated many pre-Islamic practices of Arab pagans (stoning deaths, 
	flogging the fornicators, slavery, war booty, beheading the criminals, 
	cutting hands and foots of thieves, many rituals of animal sacrifice, annual 
	pilgrimage to Mecca etc.) and readily called them Islamic or Allah’s laws. 
	Honor killing is one such pre-Islamic practice of Arab pagans which has been 
	practicing by some devout Muslim families of many good Islamic nations of 
	the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Because of the fact that the <b>“honor 
	killings</b>” do have silent support from Islam, the killers are given light 
	sentences, sometimes with little or no jail time at all. The killers are 
	primarily influenced by Islamic ethics, and mainly defend their act of 
	murder by referring to the <b>Koran and Islam</b>. They usually justify 
	their evil deeds by the directives set down in the Islamic ethical beliefs 
	and principles. Koran is very strict and belligerent regarding how to 
	control women's sexuality, and Islamic Law; Sharia, rules harsh punishments 
	including lashing and stoning to death for women's voluntary sexual 
	activities. And it is because of these Islamic elements of support, no 
	Islamic government dares to enact any criminal law to ban this barbaric 
	slaughtering of innocent family girls. <b>Even then some Islamists will 
	still say that “honor killing” has nothing to do with Islam; just the way 
	they say “Islamic terrorism” has nothing to do with the so called peaceful 
	Islam.</b> Their hypocritical denial is utter nonsense and stupendously 
	deceptive. &nbsp;I urge those Islamists to tell us why this “honor killing” never 
	happens among the non-Muslim Arab families?&nbsp; They must also tell us—why 
	no Arab and non-Arab Muslim government dare to make any strict law to ban 
	honor killings in their land?&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Denying the truth is tantamount to 
	committing this heinous crime to humanity, and denying will never solve this 
	chronic problem of Islamic nations. Only way honor killing can be stopped is 
	to admit the truth (real cause), and stop controlling public lives by the 
	draconian laws (Sharia) of Islam.&nbsp; Let there be a strict <b>separation 
	of ‘Mosque and State’</b> in every Muslim majority nation of the world.&nbsp; 
	Honor killing will definitely cease to exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
