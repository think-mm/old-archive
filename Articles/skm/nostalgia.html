	variuous faiths: Muslims, Christian, Jews, Hindus etc.) of the Islamic world 
	contributed enormously to the arts, literature, philosophy, sciences and 
	technology both by preserving and building upon earlier traditions and by 
	adding their own inventions and innovations. Muslim-born philosophers and 
	poets, artists and scientists, princes and laborers, created a unique

	thinkers?&nbsp; Answer to this above question is the main subject of this long 
	article. </p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">Islam is the only

	Claim</a> all the goodies of this planet as their own. They consider Islam 
	is the best/true religion from Allah (God) and Muslims are the best human 
	beings, and Allah only loves Muslims. Most devout fanatical Muslims in 
	particular, as well as, a good percentage of gullible Muslims in general, 
	express a special nostalgia about the so called ‘<b>Islamic golden age’</b>. 
	&nbsp;Muslims today emphatically blame western civilization in general and 
	American super power in particular for all of their problems in their own 
	country. They intentionally and deliberately mention about the past 
	historical glorious day (golden age) of Islamic Caliphate only to energize 
	Muslims to unite and fight-back western civilization in order to regain the 
	past glory of Islamic golden age. </p>

	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	This never-ending Islamic nostalgia is so deep rooted in their minds that it 
	acts like incurable disease like cancer. Although, there are already many 
	Muslims nations like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Taliban ruled Afghanistan, Sudan 
	etc which are governed/ruled by strict Islamic or semi-Islamic rules, which 
	could not bring-back their dreaming ‘Islamic Golden age’—but when asked, 
	they will say, “No, these are not ruled by pure Islam!”i.e., these are not 
	pure Islamic countries! To their mind, it is only possible, if they can 
	establish an Islamic Caliphate like Prophet Muhammad and his four Rightly 
	Guided Caliphs (truly followed the footsteps of Mohammed), Abu Bakr, Omar, 
	Uthman and Ali who ruled after Mohammed (<i>having strict Quranic 
	constitution rule by Islamic Shariaat</i>) which will solve their all 
	problems for ever. </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">To this end, some 
	western hypocrites like Maurice Bucailee and Prof. Keith Moore had 
	invigorated the Islamic zealots to dream their “Golden Age” by their 
	dishonest and unscrupulous discovery (for exchanges of money) of some 
	make-up and fraudulent/false scientific theories in Quran. This fraudulent 
	discovery of science in Quran had created an utopia of making Quran the 
	authentic words of Allah, which myriads of western educated islamists used 
	it as the biggest ‘bomb or bait’ of propaganda only to push gullible Muslim 
	society back to the darkness of 7<sup>th</sup> century. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Islamists keep bragging about many Muslim-born luminaries (who brought the 
	so called “Islamic golden age) and enthusiastically color them as “<u>Islamic 
	scientists</u>” and call their achievements as the “<u>Islamic science</u>”. 
	According to them, these ancient Muslim-born luminaries were the product of 
	religion of Islam and those ancient luminaries were <u>devout Muslims </u>
	(?) and their success was only because of Islamic teachings. They want to 
	use this as the clear proof that—Islam is a divine and true religion, 
	indeed. That is, these hypocritical western-educated Muslims attempt to 
	brain-wash gullible Muslims and force them to believe that, ‘<strong>Islam 
	actually brought science and modernity to this world’.</strong></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	For the last 30 some years, I am dealing with science, but unfortunately, I 
	never found any scientific theory which was discovered out of any world 
	religion. That is, I did not find Islamic science, Christian Science or any 
	Hindu science.&nbsp; I have only learned from the history that &quot;<strong>No 
	religion can claim science its property</strong>.&quot;&nbsp; All my life I have been 
	hearing that, religion and science do not mix and match all that well.&nbsp; Some 
	may even say that science and religion do not see eye-to-eye.&nbsp; Again, some 
	person with an extreme view may also bluntly put before you that science and 
	religion are the <u>enemy of each other</u>.&nbsp; I have also learned that, if I 
	believe in science, then it is difficult to believe in religious dogmas.&nbsp; 
	That means these two things (religion and science) are <u>like oil and 
	water-can not go mix</u>. In the most religious schools (Madrashas) of 
	Muslim nations, it is prohibited to study science.&nbsp; Take for example Sir 
	Charles Darwin's <em>Theory of Evolution</em>.&nbsp; Although widely and totally 
	accepted by modern science, the religionists will have hard time accepting 
	Darwin's conclusions.&nbsp; Therefore, it can be concluded that western educated 
	Muslims and all the Mullahs throughout the world do not believe in evolution 
	one hundred percent.&nbsp; So, what makes science and religion a good match?</p>

	In the preface of Dr. Parvez Hoodboy's (<strong>M.I.T. educated Nuclear 
	Physicist</strong>) book, Pakistani Nobel laureate Physicist <strong>DR.

	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	&nbsp;&quot;<em><b>There is only one universal Science; its problems and modalities

	The Muslim-background Nobel laureate Dr. Salam also could not find any 
	science that belongs to any religion.&nbsp;But interestingly enough, Dr. Salam 
	also became an Islamic scientist by the wishful dream of some Islamists 
	around the world.&nbsp; And that of course, after his Nobel award.&nbsp; Before 
	that-he was a Kafir. World knows well that Pakistan had constitutionally 
	declared Ahmedias a Kafir.&nbsp; Since Dr. Salam was a son of Ahamedia (Kadiani), 
	he also was a Kafir for sure. But after he received Nobel award-Dr. Salam 
	became pious Muslim overnight. What a miracle? Some over zealous Islamists 
	called Dr. Salam's achievement as &quot;Islamic science&quot;. Question is how can the 
	science do possess any religion? Dr. Salam (a son of Muslim) and Dr. 
	Weinberger (an atheist) jointly discovered the scientific theory of 
	&quot;unification of weak and electromagnetic forces&quot;. Now should we call it an
	<u>Islamic science</u> or an <u>atheist science</u>? What should we call it?</p>

	<strong><u>Liberal Freethinking Abbasid Caliphs</u></strong></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><span lang="EN">
	The so called ‘Islamic Golden Age’ was all about the success of some 
	Muslim-born freethinkers during the period of </span>liberal freethinking 
	Caliphs of Abbasid dynasty. The seventh Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun (813-833), 
	was even a greater patron of education and science than Harun al-Rashid. He 
	took considerable pains to obtain Greek manuscripts and even sent a mission 
	to the Byzantine Emperor Leon the Armenian (8l3 to 890) for that purpose. He 
	ordered the translation of these manuscripts. He organized at Baghdad a sort 
	of scientific academy called the <b>House of Wisdom</b> (Bayt al-hilkma), 
	which included a library and an observatory. He encouraged scholars from all 
	kinds (various religions), and an enormous amount of scientific work was 
	done under his patronage. This was the most ambitious undertaking of its 
	kind since the foundation of the Alexandrian Museum (q. v. first half of 
	third century B. C.). </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Al-Ma'mun 'Abdallah al-Ma'mun' was born in Baghdad in 786, and he died near 
	Tarsus in 833. <b>Al-Ma'mun was the seventh and greatest 'Abbasid caliph 
	(813-833)</b>. His mother and wife were Persians, which explains his Persian 
	and 'Alid proclivities. He was an ardent <b>Mu'tazil,</b> tried to enforce 
	his views by means of violence. He wrote four long letters to explain the
	<strong>Qur'an was created</strong>, and he cruelly punished those who dared 
	entertain different views (e.g., Ibn Hannibal). He thus combined in a 
	remarkable way free thought and intolerance. While persecuting those who 
	objected to Mu'tazilism, Jews and Christians were very welcome at his court.</p>

	Now, we shall examine the life history of some very famous luminaries of the 
	Islamic “Golden Age” to evaluate historical truth whether these Muslim-born 
	freethinkers were true believers of Islam or any other religion per se. We 
	shall also examine whether the core teachings of religion Islam had anyway 
	influenced or contributed (as erroneously believed by most Islamists) to the 
	success of medieval Muslim scientists. Let us find out about the religious 
	fervor (if there was any) of some of the most famous ancient so called 
	Islamic scientists and thinkers: </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	1. <b><span lang="EN">Ab&#363; Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakar&#299;ya al-R&#257;zi</span>&nbsp;(865-925):<span style="color: maroon">
	</span></b><span lang="EN">was a Persian physician, philosopher, and 
	scholar. According to al-Biruni he was born in&nbsp; Rayy, Iran the year 865 AD 
	and died there in 925 AD. He </span>was perhaps the greatest Muslim-born 
	scientist in the whole of Islamic world. He was one of the great physicians 
	of all times. <span lang="EN">Al-Razi made fundamental and enduring 
	contributions to the fields of&nbsp; Medicine, alchemy, and philosophy, recorded 
	in over 184 books and articles in various fields of science. He was 
	well-versed in Greek and Indian Medical knowledge and added substantially to 
	them from his own observations. </span>&nbsp;He is the author of the monumental 
	encyclopedia al Hawi, on which he worked for fifteen years. Now, let us read 
	what al-Razi thought about religions in general.&nbsp; </p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><b>
	<span lang="EN">On Religion</span></b><span lang="EN">:&nbsp; Al-Razi wrote three 
	books dealing with religion:&nbsp; (1) <i>The Prophet's Fraudulent Tricks</i>, 
	(2) <i>The Stratagems of Those Who Claim to Be Prophets</i> (Arabic &#1581;&#1610;&#1604; 
	&#1575;&#1604;&#1605;&#1578;&#1606;&#1576;&#1610;&#1610;&#1606;), and (3) <i>On the Refutation of Revealed Religions</i> (Arabic 
	&#1605;&#1582;&#1575;&#1585;&#1602; &#1575;&#1604;&#1575;&#1606;&#1576;&#1610;&#1575;&#1569;). He offered harsh criticism concerning religions, in 
	particular those religions that claim to have been revealed by prophetic 
	experiences. </span></p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>About Prophets 
	al-Razi wrote</b>: “The prophets—these billy goats with long beard, (as Ar 
	Razi disdainfully describes them)—cannot claim any intellectual or spiritual 
	superiority. <i>These billy goats pretend to come with a message from God, 
	all the while exhausting themselves in spouting their lies, and imposing on 
	the masses blind obedience to the &quot;words of the master.&quot;</i> The miracles of 
	the prophets are impostures, based on trickery, or the stories regarding 
	them are lies. The falseness of what all the prophets say is evident in the 
	fact that they contradict one another: one affirms what the other denies, 
	and yet each claims to be the sole depository of the truth; thus the New 
	Testament contradicts the <b>Torah,</b> <b>the Koran the New Testament</b>. 
	As for the Koran, it is but an assorted mixture of <b>‘absurd and 
	inconsistent fables</b>,’ which has ridiculously been judged inimitable, 
	when, in fact, its language, style, and its much-vaunted ‘eloquence’ are far 
	from being faultless.”&nbsp; According to Albert Hourani, “he laid emphasis on 
	reason as the sole guide, and dismissed <b>revelation a false and religion a 
	dangerous</b>.”&nbsp; </p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><b>
	<span lang="EN">About God’s messenger, al-Razi continued</span></b><span lang="EN">, 
	“On what ground do you deem it necessary that God should single out certain 
	individuals [by giving them prophecy], that he should set them up above 
	other people, that he should appoint them to be the people’s guides, and 
	make people dependent upon them?”&nbsp; Al-Razi argued that, “<b>it would be 
	illogical for God to reveal himself only to a selected few.</b> God should 
	not set some individuals over others, and there should be between them 
	neither rivalry nor disagreement which would bring them to perdition.”&nbsp; 
	Concerning the link between violence and religion, Al-Razi expressed that 
	“God must have known, considering the many disagreements between different 
	religions, that &quot;there would be a universal disaster and they would perish 
	in the mutual hostilities and fightings. Indeed, many people have perished 
	in this way, as we can see.”</span></p>

	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><span lang="EN">
	He was also critical of the lack of interest among religious adherents in 
	the rational and analysis of their beliefs, and the violent reaction which

	(1126-1198):</b>&nbsp; This great mind born in Andalusa, Spain and was an 
	important philosopher and scientist, known in the Western world as Averroes. 
	His influence on European thought tends to be forgotten by Arabs and 
	Europeans alike. But in the 13th and 14th century Averroism was as 
	influential as was Marxism in the 19th century. Ibn Rushd worked as a 
	mediator between the Arabic and the Western world by commenting and 
	interpreting Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato, making them 
	accessible to Arabic culture. He considered Aristotle as ‘the Prefect Man’. 
	He wrote extensive commentaries on Aristotle and earned the epithet of “The 
	Commentator”. “He expounded the Quran in Aristotelian terms. In many of his 
	works, he also tried to mediate between philosophy and religion. </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Religious leaders 
	did not always praise his works; he was condemned for heresy by the 
	Christian, the Jewish and the Islamic orthodoxy and his works were 
	frequently banished and burnt.”&nbsp; Ibn Rushd fell out of favor with the Caliph 
	due to the opposition that theologians had raised against his writings. He 
	was accused of heresy, interrogated and banned to Lucena, close to Cordova. 
	At the same time, <u>the Caliph ordered the books of the philosopher to be 
	burnt, with the exception of his works on Medicine, Arithmetics and 
	Elementary Astronomy (around <b>1195</b>).</u> Somewhat later the Caliph 
	revoked the banishment and called Ibn Rushd back to Marrakesh. The works of 
	Ibn Rushd also aroused admiration in Europe, even among those theologians 
	who saw a danger for religious faith in his writings. <u>In the 13th 
	century, Ibn Rushd was condemned by bishops from Paris, Oxford and 
	Canterbury for reasons similar to those that had caused his condemnation by 
	the orthodox Muslims in Spain.</u></p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Abu Yaqub, the 
	Caliph of Morocco, called him to his capital and appointed him as his 
	physician in place of Ibn Tufail. His son Yaqub al-Mansur retained him for 
	some time <u>but soon Ibn Rushd's views on theology and philosophy drew the 
	Caliph's wrath.</u> All his books, barring strictly scientific ones, were 
	burnt and he was banished to Lucena. However, as a result of intervention of 
	several leading scholars he was forgiven after about four years and recalled 
	to Morocco in 1198; but he died towards the end of the same year.&nbsp; Ibn Rushd 
	was a liberal, an exponent of liberation of women and regarded “much of the 
	poverty and distress of the times arises from the fact that women are kept 
	like “domestic animals or house plants for purposes of gratification, of a 
	very questionable character besides, instead of being allowed to take part 
	in the production of material and intellectual wealth, and in the

	Geber, aka Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan, was a prominent Islamic alchemist,

	referred to as &quot;the father of Arab chemistry&quot; by Europeans. His ethnic 
	background is not clear; although most sources state he was an Arab, some 
	describe him as Persian. Jabir was born in Tus, Khorasan, in Iran, which was 
	at the time ruled by the Umayyad Caliphate. He was the son of Hayyan 
	al-Azdi, a pharmacist of the Arabian Azd tribe who emigrated from Yemen to 
	Kufa (in present-day Iraq) during the Umayyad Caliphate. </p>

	Jabir is mostly known for his contributions to chemistry. He emphasised 
	systematic experimentation, and did much to free alchemy from superstition 
	and turn it into a science. He is credited with the invention of many types 
	of now-basic chemical laboratory equipment, and with the discovery and 
	description of many now-commonplace chemical substances and processes - such 
	as the hydrochloric and nitric acids, distillation, and crystalization ­ 
	that have become the foundation of today's chemistry and chemical 
	engineering. Jabir's alchemical investigations were theoretically grounded 
	in an elaborate numerology related to Pythagorean and Neoplatonic systems. 
	In his writings, Jabir pays tribute to Egyptian and Greek alchemists Hermes 
	Trismegistus, Agathodaimon, Pythagoras, and Socrates. </p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	His books strongly influenced the medieval European alchemists and justified 
	their search for the philosopher's stone. In spite of his leanings toward 
	mysticism (he was considered a Sufi) and superstition, he more clearly 
	recognised and proclaimed the importance of experimentation. Jabir became an 
	alchemist at the court of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, for whom he wrote the 
	Kitab al-Zuhra (&quot;The Book of Venus&quot;, on &quot;the noble art of alchemy&quot;). In the

	<b>Science vs. Religion:</b></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Religion had been at odds with science, still is at odds, and it will remain 
	so until all religions would take demise from this mortal world. After the 
	renaissance (i.e. during the last 3-4 centuries)-in the marathon race of 
	dominance, science had won and religion had lost.&nbsp; This is pure and simple.&nbsp; 
	Now, to compete with science, every religionists searching science in their 
	own scriptures with a massive magnifying glass. Islam is the champion in 
	this line.&nbsp; Alas, there could be no science in the scriptures of Islam or in 
	any religion for sure.&nbsp; I myself first read Qur'an and Hadiths (after I read 
	the book of M. Bucaille) in search of science, but <strong><u>could not 
	find/match</u></strong> a single verse/Hadiths with modern-day science.&nbsp; I 
	was dismayed how <b>M. Bucaille</b> <b>fooled Muslims to earn his millions</b>.&nbsp; 
	He surely fooled the gullible Muslims while pocketing a large sum of money 
	he received from Saudi King and also by selling his book (full of fraudulent 
	scientific absurdities) mostly to Muslims.&nbsp; This does not bode well for 
	Muslims.&nbsp; They have been portrayed as cretins in the eyes of modern world, 
	which I hate to admit. </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Allow me to juxtapose Secularism and democracy vis-a-vis a blind faith we 
	lovingly call the religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the &quot;<strong>SECULARISM AND DEMOCRACY</strong>&quot; 
	which can boost for science and not any RELIGION for sure. The European 
	Renaissance was born in the yoke of SACULARISM AND DEMOCRACY.&nbsp; Europe was in 
	the “Dark Age” as long as they were submerged with religious dogmas under 
	the Roman Catholics.&nbsp;Scores of scientists, freethinkers lost their lives at 
	the hands of fantasist religionists. Even today, any country that took the 
	religion as their state constitution is living under the spell of darkness 
	and they are <u>taking a journey driving their locomotive in the reverse 
	gear</u>.&nbsp; And this is very true in the field of science. Good examples are 
	Iran, Saudi Arabia, and all other Muslim countries as well.&nbsp; As long as all 
	the Muslim countries remain under the clutch of religion Islam, Muslims will 
	never be able to compete in the field of science with the rest of the world.
	<strong>The less religious orthodoxy, the more achievement in science. That 
	explains Muslim's relative advancement around Ninth/Tenth centuries inspired 
	by </strong><b><u>Mu‘tazilites</u><strong> (rational thinkers with less 
	orthodoxy) and Christian Europe's backwardness (closed minds with more 
	orthodoxy).</strong></b></p>

	<strong>Science and Civilizations</strong>:</p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Science started its journey right from the day when ancient cave peoples 
	made their first weapon from the stone.&nbsp; <strong>Necessities and human 
	curiosities were the engine of all sciences</strong>.&nbsp; Science never dropped 
	from the sky for anybody.&nbsp; Science is the continuous product of human 
	civilizations.&nbsp; Not by one or two, but by all civilizations of the world 
	such as: Ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Chinese, Indian, Assyrian, Persian, 
	Greek (Hellenistic), Roman, Islamic Arab, etc, etc.&nbsp; All of this 
	civilization took part in the &quot;<strong>RELAY RACE</strong>&quot; of shaping up 
	ancient science, which was the building block of modern science.&nbsp; Ancient 
	Egyptians (3000 BC) studied the heavens to forecast seasons, used advanced 
	geometry to build Pyramids.&nbsp; They also learned human anatomy, physiology, 
	surgery and medicine, etc.&nbsp; All of the above mentioned ancient pre-Arab 
	civilizations were very advanced in medicine, astronomy, geometry, 
	mathematics and other scientific fields much before the arrival of 
	Islamic-Arab civilization. </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Ancient Greeks left the greatest scientific heritage of all the ancient 
	peoples. Most scientific successes were achieved during the Hellenistic 
	period who established world's largest ancient library at Alexandria 
	(Egypt), where half a million books were kept.&nbsp; No one can think about 
	ancient science without naming <b>Hippocrates, Aristotle, Thales, 
	Pythagoras, Euclid, Galen, etc.,</b> and obviously, those scientists did not 
	learn science from Islamic Allah or Judeo-Christian’s God.&nbsp; Another very 
	interesting factor is-all the above mentioned civilizations, somehow or 
	rather, came in contact with each other (overlapping one by the other) at 
	the Middle Eastern region.&nbsp; <strong>Had there been no ancient Egypt, 
	Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Chinese, Indian, Persian, etc., there could be 
	no science available to Arab to transmit them to the west.&nbsp; Just as, had 
	there been no Judaism, Paganism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Bahaism 
	was existed in the Middle east-there could be no Islam or no Qur'an 
	written/produced (copied) by Muhammad.&nbsp; </strong>It should not elude any 
	inquisitive mind that there is an awful lot similarity between the Old 
	Testament stories and Qur'anic folklore. Even the tenor of Old Testament God 
	and Islamic Allah seems to be very similar. Coincidence? Huuh!&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Let me cite a quotation of George Sarton (History of Science): &quot;<em>The 
	foundations of science were laid for us by the Mesopotamian civilizations, 
	whose scholars and scientists were their priests, and to them we owe 
	foundations of medicine, navigation, astronomy and some mathematics. The 
	second development came through the Greeks as taught in the traditional way 
	in Western schools and colleges. </em><strong><i>The third stage of 
	development however is to be credited to the dazzling rise of Islam, whose 
	Abbasid caliphs drank avidly at the foundation of the ancient Persian and 
	Hindu as well as Greek sources of knowledge. For nearly four hundred years 
	Islam led the world of science. From </i></strong><em>Spain to India, the 
	great body of past knowledge was exchanged between her scholars and the 
	torch carried forward with new discoveries. Scholars of Christendom from 
	about the eleventh through the thirteenth century were mainly occupied with 
	translating books from Arabic to Latin. Thus, Islam paved the way for the 
	renaissance which in turn led to science's fourth </em><strong><i>great 
	development in the modern western world</i></strong><em>&quot;. </em></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Now, what have we learned from the above quotation?&nbsp; One could see in the 
	statement of George Sarton the echo of my thesis.&nbsp;That is science is the 
	product of continuous <strong>RELAY RACE</strong> (development/research) by 
	many different civilizations one after another.&nbsp; In the history of mankind, 
	civilization always took shape by some popular slogans/manifesto by 
	different nations.&nbsp; Some came with nationalistic spirits (such as Egyptian, 
	Persian, Roman, Chinese, Indian, etc.), and some came with the popular 
	slogans of religion (such as Islamic Arab).&nbsp; In true sense, all of them were 
	imperialistic forces in some different names and identity, and their main 
	objective was to conquer new lands to gain wealth (by plundering war booty) 
	and power.&nbsp; Every civilization when got some tranquility and peaceful times, 
	it flourished in various (scientific, social, political, etc.) fields.&nbsp; 
	Islamic-Arab revolution was no exception. The PBS documentary (2005) by Mr. 
	Robert Gardner, &quot;Islam: Empire of Faith,&quot; clearly showed the Arab 
	imperialistic history.&nbsp;This film failed to show any spirituality or, should 
	I say divinity, which was purely absent in Islamic utopia.&nbsp; The viewers will 
	have hard time forgetting that violence ad infinitum, those naked 
	terrorizing bend swords, or scores of conspiracies to kill the rivals, own 
	sons, own friend.&nbsp; These are of course not at all signs of so-called 
	peaceful religion.&nbsp; Instead, the viewers will mostly remember Islam as
	<strong>the NAKED SWORD WAVING MEGALOMANIAC IMPERILISTIC FORCE getting ready 
	to swallow the entire world.</strong>&nbsp; The present-day Ummatic belief among 
	Jihadist Muslims is remnants of the same belief.</p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Fact of the matter is the golden age of Islamic Empire (Abbasid) happened 
	only because the natural sciences and the so-called Islamic sciences (read- 
	religious study) were kept separate in the colleges (house of wisdom in 
	Baghdad) of the day. It seems no coincidence that only when the religious 
	authorities started to interfere with the natural sciences, starting in the 
	11th century (Imam Ghazali’s movement to crush Mu’tazillites), did the 
	golden age of Islamic civilization lose its glitter.</p>

	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><span lang="EN">
	Shafa criticized the terminologies such as: &quot;Islamic civilization&quot;, &quot;Islamic 
	science&quot;, &quot;Islamic medicine&quot;, &quot;Islamic astronomy&quot;, &quot;Islamic scientists&quot;, 
	etc. Shafa states that while religion has been a cardinal foundation for 
	nearly all empires of antiquity to derive their legitimacy from, it does not 
	possess adequate defining factors to advance a kingdom or domain in 
	accumulation and furtherance of science, technology, arts, and culture in a 
	way to justify attribution of such developments to existence and practice of 
	a certain faith within that realm.”</span></p>

	Shafa particularly points out that: “counting all scholars in the Islamic 
	empires as muslims, can also be misleading, since with the harsh punishment 
	and prosecution awaiting alleged heretics and <b>Zind&#299;q</b> ((<i>refers to 
	those muslims who’s beliefs have strayed so far from mainstream Islamic 
	beliefs to have left Islam altogether</i>), no sane scientist or 
	intellectual would dare express his/her true faith and religious thoughts.” 
	To exemplify this matter, Shafa alludes to two of the most prominent 
	physicians/philosophers of the Islamic era, namely Avicenna and Rhazes the 
	former being a true muslim that was charged with heresy for mere utterance 
	of his philosophical ideas; and the latter daringly and openly criticizing 
	revelational religions (viz. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism) 
	in three of his controversial treatises, exposing himself to great peril. 
	Bearing this personality comparison in mind, <u>factors other than Islamic 
	thought</u> should be considered to have contributed to the great 
	achievements of such individuals.</span></p>

	<strong>What were the sources of Arab/Islamic Science?</strong></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Nevertheless, we must give credit to Arab-Islamic civilization for their 
	role of obtaining, preserving and some improvement of that available ancient 
	science left by other different civilizations and finally transmitting them 
	to the West.&nbsp; Islamists very often talking about the modern scientific debt 
	to Islamic civilization, but they never say anything about the Arab's 
	scientific debt to those ancient civilizations, and I wonder why they are so 
	reluctant to give any credits to those who deserve it?&nbsp; Can any Islamist 
	tell us what the source of Islamic science was?&nbsp; Was it from Qur'an or 
	Hadiths, or did it come from the heaven through the courtesy of winged 
	archangels?&nbsp; <strong>Certainly not!&nbsp; </strong>Arab civilization did not see 
	the light of science until the middle of 8<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; There was 
	hardly any science developed during the time of Prophet Muhammad and his 
	'Caliphate-e-Rashedins' period.&nbsp; It was the period of liberal Muslim kings 
	of Abbasid dynasty when Arab civilization finally begun to see the light of 
	science.&nbsp; There is no scope to give the detail history in this short essay, 
	but it is prudent to note that-Arabs during the Abbasid kingdoms at Baghdad 
	actually got hold to those ancient science through their conquests.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	They were clever and open minded enough to know that a kingdom could make 
	awful lot of money by exploiting science.&nbsp; They got hold to the Greek 
	(Hellenistic) library and begun to translate all those available scientific 
	books of Latin/Greek into Arabic for a good reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	The point of this history is to show how the golden age that Islamists/ 
	fundamentalists refer to was achieved only because Baghdad was wide open to 
	foreign influences, much as the United States at its birth imported ideas of 
	the enlightenment from Europe and made more of them than did the Old World. 
	One can go further. Many of the scholars who translated the manuscripts of 
	the Greeks, Indians and Chinese, and who flocked to Baghdad in the golden 
	age, were <strong>Christians, Jews and pagans</strong>. Although the West as 
	we know it today didn't exist in the 9th and 10th centuries, one could say 
	that the Arab world was, for a time, part of the intellectual circle that 
	would become the West. Many of the Greek classics reached Europe via Muslim 
	Toledo, in Spain, where they were translated from Arabic into Latin. </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	These people were not religious priest or Mullahs; they were intellectuals 
	of that particular civilization.&nbsp;Islamic civilization actually acted as the 
	conduit between the ancient science and western receiver who actually better 
	utilized the ancient product. <strong>Had there been other civilization such 
	as Mongols or Chinese dominant at that very period instead of Arab 
	civilization-same thing could have happened with the transmitting of science 
	to the West</strong>.&nbsp;We must not forget that major breakthrough in science 
	that world knew about the Arab civilization are the Arab numerals, 
	Gunpowders, paper, medical knowledge, etc.&nbsp; And it is interesting to note 
	that among those ancient science-<strong>Arab actually got numerals from 
	Indian mathematicians called &quot;Hindu-Arabic Numerals&quot; Gun powder and papers 
	technology from Chinese; and Medical knowledge from Indian, Egyptians</strong>,
	<strong>Persians, Mesopotamians, and Chinese</strong>. </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<strong>Brief History how Arabs did get science:</strong></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<strong>The Paper</strong>: It was a Chinese invention of the first 
	centuryA.D. and it reached the Middle East via the Battle of Talas (near 
	Tashkent) in 751, when some Chinese paper makers were captured&nbsp; by the 
	Arabs. But it was the Arabs who rose paper making to new heights. </p>
	<p class="articletext" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	<strong>The hospital</strong>:&nbsp; was a Persian idea from as early as the 
	sixth century, under the<br>
	name &quot;bimaristan.&quot; But in Baghdad the institution became much more 
	sophisticated, with special wards for internal diseases, contagious cases 
	and psychiatric patients. Field hospitals accompanying Arab armies were also 
	introduced. <br>
	<br>
	<strong>The Mathematics</strong>: In the late eighth century, an Indian 
	merchant brought to Baghdad two seminal mathematical works. One was the 
	Brahmasphuta Siddhanta, known to Arabs as the Sindhind, the work of the 
	great seventh-century Indian mathematician Brahmagupta. This contained early 
	ideas about al-jabr, to give algebra its Arabic name. It was this work that 
	Muhammad ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi in the ninth century was to expand on so 
	successfully. Khwarizmi became known as &quot;the father of algebra&quot; and gave his 
	name to algorithms. <br>
	<br>
	The same Indian merchant also brought a manuscript that introduced for the 
	first time outside India the nine Hindu&nbsp;numerals we use to this day and are 
	now called Arabic numerals. (Before that, numbers were written out as words 
	or notated with letters of the alphabet.) This document also contained
	<strong>the first mention of the 0,</strong> <strong>which the Arabs</strong>
	<strong>called zephirum,</strong> from which our words zero and cipher are 
	derived. But again, it was the Baghdadis who built on these imported 
	innovations, to create what one historian of mathematics has called &quot;the 
	Arabic hegemony.&quot; In addition to Khwarizmi, this group included Ibn Turk, 
	al-Karkhi, al-Biruni, al-Haytham (called Alhazen in the West), Nasir Eddin 
	and Omar Khayyam (the &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; fame). <br>
	<br>
	Finally, Aristotle, as a pagan, he posed a problem for Muslims - as he did 
	for Christians a couple of centuries later. Nevertheless, the power of his 
	ideas triumphed, and a whole slew of Arab &quot;falasafahs&quot; were influenced by 
	Aristotle - Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Khaldun among them. In addition, 
	al-Farabi glossed Plato, al-Rhazi (Rhazes) built on Galen and Hippocrates, 
	and Ibn Qurrah added to Euclid and Archimedes. </p>
	<p class="articletext" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">
	Of course, Muslim-born scientists did some improvement or improvisation to 
	that ancient science.&nbsp; In modern time, Japanese are known to be a 
	practitioner of that policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting point is most of those 
	renowned Muslim scientists were non-Arab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as: Al-Khwarizmi 
	(Uzbekistan); Al-Razi (Tehran); Al-Ghazzali (Khorman, Iran); Al-Tabari 
	(Tabristan); Al-Farabi (Turkistan); Al-Biruni (Khwarizm, Uzbekistan); Ibn 
	Sina (Bukhara, Central Asia); Ibn Rushd (Cordoba, Spain) and so on. &nbsp;All 
	those scientists/philosophers happened to be sons of Muslim.&nbsp; None of them 
	were a Mullah or Maolana, and <strong>none of them ever claimed that they 
	got scientific theory by reading Qur'an or gobbling the Hadiths.&nbsp; Then, why 
	do all those Islamists bring religion in the field of science?&nbsp; Is there any 
	ulterior motive?</strong></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Religion of any type (Christian, Jews, Islam, Hinduism etc.) can never claim 
	Science as their own property. Similarly, religion should never claim any 
	credit whatsoever, for the advancement of any science. Galileo was a great 
	scientist by his knowledge not because he was a son of Christian. In the 
	same vein, Ibne Sina was a scientist by virtue of his quality and not 
	because he was a son of Muslim. Einstein was a great scientist because of 
	his intellect and acuity, not because of his knowledge in Torah.&nbsp; <strong>
	Today, almost 95% of world's leading scientists are the sons of Christians.&nbsp; 
	Should we then consider that Christian religion/Bible are the storehouse of 
	all science?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does the world history support this?&nbsp; Or, should we say that 
	ancient Hindu Kafirs got science of mathematics (numerals) from Rada 
	krishna?</strong></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<em><span style="font-style: normal">Islamists frequently claim that the 
	Koran is full of exhortation to the believers to study nature and to find 
	the signs of God in the phenomena of nature.</span>
	<span style="font-style: normal">But</span> </em>I did not find any Qur'anic 
	verse that asked people to study the nature in the scientific point of view, 
	rather Allah tried to show those nature (Sky, Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, etc.) 
	as the evidence that Allah is really very powerful who can create all those 
	naturally impossible things.&nbsp; Now, do we have to believe that, before the 
	arrival of Qur'an mankind never saw the sky (heaven), earth, sun, moon and 
	stars?&nbsp; What Qur'an told about the nature, even cave peoples could have seen 
	them very well by their own bare eyes.&nbsp; Yes, Qur'an repeatedly talked about 
	heaven, earth, sun, moon, stars, etc., just to exhibit the strength (threat) 
	and might of Allah and repeatedly told human being to think about this 
	miracle of placing sky as the canopy without pillars (which is ridiculous), 
	making stars to shoot the Satan, placing mountain to make the earth 
	immovable, created thunder to shoot the sinners, created earthquake to 
	punish the kafirs, revolving poor sun daily to make day and night, making 
	wide and flat earth, etc. and a whole slue of other things to reel your 
	head.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, are those Allah's assertions anyway to be taken as scientific 
	theory?&nbsp; What is the actual point? Should we go back to fundamentals of 
	Islam and establish true Islamic dogmas (because according to some 
	apologists only Islam can inspire science) like Afghan Talibans? Should we 
	banned all western style education systems; should we banned all secularism, 
	and establish<em> &quot;Kaoumi Madrashas&quot; or &quot;Alia madrashas&quot; </em>to bring back 
	so called Islamic science?&nbsp; Come on give me break!&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<strong>Conclusion:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">In conclusion, I can unambiguously 
	summarize the fact that the so called Islamic Golden Age was not any product 
	of Islamic scriptural knowledge, nor it was due to any degree of devoutness 
	of religion Islam, rather it was due to short-lived opportunity of 
	freethinking and rationalism induced by the famous Mu’tazillites and 
	facilitated by the liberal minded Abbasid Kingdom. </span></strong></p>
	<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">What was the 
	ideology of Mu’tazila which actually opened the window for rational 
	thinkers? The defining philosophy of Mu’tazila was freewill, rationalism and 
	scientific thought which was rooted in the Hellenic-age Greek philosophy. 
	Mu’tazila ideology was greatly promoted during Abbasid Calipahate (8-13<sup>th</sup> 
	century) but after that Islamic re-incarnation by Ahadiths collection by 
	Muslim al –hajjaj, al-Bukhari, Abu daud, al-Timidi and rise of islamic 
	zealots by the leadership of Imam Ghazali put the final nail to the coffin 
	of defeated Mu’tazillites—leading to the end of enlightment during 13<sup>th</sup> 
	century and subsequently rise of Islamic devoutness (darkness of close minds 
	and superstitions) in the Islamic world, which ended the so called Islamic 
	Golden Age for good. </p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The Quran 
	emphatically forbade pursuance knowledge and learning that falls outside the 
	scope of Quran and Sunnah for fear of going astray by emulating path of 
	error and heresay. Quran directly contradicted the very principle of 
	Mu’tazilies. Hence, Islamic theological knowledge had very little to 
	contribute to the attainment of the Golden Age.</p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	When Muslims talk about Islamic Golden Age, they mostly think of Islamic 
	rule by the Prophet Muhammad and his four Rightly Guided Caliphs (truly 
	followed the footsteps of Mohammed), Abu Bakr, Omar, Uthman and Ali who 
	ruled after Mohammed. Their ruling time only lasted about 30 years. History 
	recorded in the Islamic books only tell us that these Islamic rulers were 
	busy fighting and killing their rivals, apostates, and non-muslims, 
	occupying lands and property (war booties), assassinating political rivals, 
	etc. etc. Polygamy (filling their harem with multiple wives) and 
	child-marriage, mu’ta marriage (temporary marriage). Alas, nobody can find 
	even a trace of scientific advances during this 30 year period of Islamic 
	rule. It was the same scenario with the European “Dark Age” of 
	fundamentalist Christian rule by the Roman Catholic Papal Empire.</p>
	<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The real 
	contribution of theological force of Islam was the formulation of “Islamic 
	Sharia laws” derived directly from the <i>Quran</i> and <i>Sunnah </i>which 
	was solely responsibl<i>e </i>to keep Muslims in the darkness of 
	superstitious past which constantly kept them away from the enlightment of 
	science. Even after 1400 years, Muslim nations could not free themselves 
	from the clutch of Islamic Sharia laws which is the cause of Muslims 
	backwardness in education, science, technology, women rights etc. Forget 
	about any scientific revolution, even there was no healthy political 
	democracy or economical development did occur during the period of four 
	Caliphs (khula-faye-Rashedins). In fact, Islam established an era of Arab 
	imperialistic Kingship, which later invaded/occupied (by the sword) one 
	fourth of the world in the name of Islam.&nbsp; </p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify">It is quite 
	interesting to learn from the true historical account that almost all 
	freethinkers and rationalists within the Islamic world, such as Ibn Sina, 
	Al-Razi, Al-Farabi, Al-Ma’arri, Omar Khayyam, Ibn Rusd, Al-Khwarizmi etc 
	were having little or no faith on Islamic orthodoxical dictums, nor they 
	were at all motivated by theological teachings from Islamic books, yet Islam 
	owned them (as the Islamic product) completely, by the same old Islamic 
	tactics. Surprisingly, world’s other major religions such as: Christianity, 
	Judaism, Hinduism or Buddhism never claimed such “false credit” for 
	scientific contributions, because they all know it well that religion and 
	science can not go hand in hand; rather, one becomes a dangerous and genuine 
	obstacle to the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<b>Now let me put some very prudent questions: </b></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<b>(a) </b>If the Islamists still consider that Arab got the ancient science 
	from Qur'an or Hadiths, then would it not be normal that those Islamic 
	Mullahs would discover the science first?&nbsp; <strong>(b)</strong> Would it not 
	be normal to expect the revolution of science coming first from all those 
	Maulanas, Qaari, Imams, Muftis, teachers of all Madrashas, all Madrassah 
	students, all Talibans-simply because they are the people who are really 
	expert in Qur'an and Hadiths?&nbsp; <strong>(c)</strong> If Islamic Arab 
	civilization derived scientific knowledge from the religion (Qur'an and 
	Hadiths) and they brought some science to the West, then after that, what 
	made those Muslims totally burnt-out and become obsolete in the field of 
	science today? <strong>(d)</strong> Should it not be a normal phenomenon 
	that, in today's modern scientific race, Muslims would still lead the rest 
	of the world?&nbsp; (<strong>e</strong>) Since some apologists believe religion 
	has no quarrel with science; could we ask all the Islamic Mullahs to declare
	<strong>Darwin Evolution Theory is </strong><u>acceptable to Islamic 
	theologians?</u>&nbsp; <strong>(f)</strong> Could any Islamist tell us what are 
	the reasons that none of the Muslim nations come even close to other 
	advanced nations in the field of science? </p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<b>Caution: </b></p>
	<p class="articletext" align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	Unfortunately, the rising of Iranian Mullaism, the religious resurgence by 
	the evil designs of Islamic fanaticisms and gradual militancies in the 
	Muslim world for the last several decades, rising waves of Osama bin laden’s 
	jihadi Islamic terrorisms, have ultimately roused the religious fervor 
	amongst gullible Muslims. They &nbsp;have not only energized the dream of 
	reviving false “Islamic Golden Age” among the Muslims in general; this 
	age-old religious virus also gradually infecting the western Christianity, 
	especially in America, which poses a great danger of <b>turning the clock of 
	scientific race backward</b>. Replacement of “Evolution theory” by the 
	grandma’s folklore story of “Biblical creation theory” in some American 
	public schools, banning scientific research with human embryos and deceiving 
	bright scopes of various biological researches by American Government are a 
	few examples of this dangerous syndrome.&nbsp; The world should not forget those 
	past “shameful episodes” of Christian mullahs in Europe (in middle age) with 
	the ancient luminaries like: Copernicus, Brno, Galileo’s, unless mankind, or 
	the world want to lose the present hard-earned flourishing galloping waves 
	of scientific glitters into the darkness of religions and superstitions of 
	the past. There is still time left for mankind sympathetic to science and 
	modernity which are driven by logic and rationalism, to join us in our fight 
	to break the manacles of repressive age-old religions. There shouldn't be 
	any room for faith-based systems that would push us back a good fourteen 
	centuries.&nbsp; The present modern world is driven and established by the 
	continuous success and glory of science<strong>.&nbsp; Unless, we already forgot 
	that.&nbsp; </strong></p>
