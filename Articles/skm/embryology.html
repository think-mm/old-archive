                  Although, the world’s history tells us that no religion can 
                  boast/demand any credit for the advancement of modern science, 
                  at least one religion “Islam” very recently started 
                  futile/meaningless propaganda of the possession of scientific 
                  theories from the divine source.&nbsp; This unique and untrue claim 
                  has been carefully orchestrated and manipulated by some 
                  unscrupulous Muslims with the help of two western medical 
                  scientists mainly for three purposes: (a) to continue monopoly 
                  business of Saudi Kingdom’s revenue from Hajj pilgrimage; (b) 
                  to rejuvenate&nbsp; Islamic fundamentalism; and (c) to earn easy 
                  money by those two western scientists.&nbsp; Readers please read 
                  the NFB’s article, titled: Religion, Science and Bogus 
                  claims”, dated Feb. 8, 2000, by Khurshed Chowdhury.&nbsp; Fact of 
                  the matter is, religion and&nbsp; Science are two completely 
                  opposite subjects having rivalry and contradictions from the 
                  dawn of the human civilization.&nbsp; Readers please also read a 
                  very well written NFB article, dated: 4/21/00, titled: 
                  “Religion and Science” by Mr. Nurul I. Mukul. </span></p>

                  However, it is the intention of this essay to examine what 
                  exactly was known about the human origin at the time of 7<sup>th</sup> 
                  century period in order to see whether any of the theories 
                  expressed in the Qur'an were true or indeed well known before 
                  this time. </span></p>

                  There are at least 60 verses which deal explicitly with human 
                  origin and developmental sequences inside the womb, but these 
                  are scattered throughout the Qur'an and many of the them are 
                  repeated over and over again, as is common to much of the 
                  book. An useful place to begin would be the material out of 
                  which we are created.&nbsp; Although, one would expect the Qur'an 
                  to be unambiguous about such an elementary matter, but the 
                  verses listed show just how much uncertainty there appears to 
                  be in our origins. Note that except where indicated the 
                  translation used is the translation of Yusuf Ali (Saudi

                  before passing through the kidneys and via the testicles into

                  It is quite plausible to consider that, Prophet Muhammad
