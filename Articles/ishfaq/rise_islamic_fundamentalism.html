															The grenade attack 
															on the AL meeting on 
															August 21 once again 
															reminded us of the 
															threat posed by 
															extremists in our 
															society. It is not 
															too difficult to see 
															a common thread in 
															the terrorist acts 
															perpetrated over the 
															last five years.
															</font></p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															It all started with 
															the bombing of 
															Udichi's musical 
															programme in Jessore 
															on March 6, 1999. 
															Udichi, since its 
															inception in 
															pre-liberation days, 
															has been a 
															left-leaning musical 
															group that opposed 
															fundamentalism and 
															religious bigotry. 
															To the religious 
															extremists, Udichi 
															was a genuine target 
															for elimination. 
															When the bombs went 
															off in Jessore, the 
															performers from 
															Lalon Academy of 
															Kushtia were on 
															stage. Lalon is a 
															much loved and 
															widely revered 
															mystic poet-singer 
															of Bengal, but to 
															the present breed of 
															Islamic extremists 
															all kinds of music, 
															especially &quot;Sufi&quot; 
															music, is an 
															anathema. So, if you 
															can't stop them, 
															bomb them! The 
															result: 10 dead and 
															many injured and 
															maimed for life, 
															including a few from 
															the Lalon Academy.
															</font></p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															On October 8, 1999, 
															religious extremists 
															attacked the 
															Ahmadiyya Mosque in 
															Khulna. The result: 
															8 dead and many 
															injured. Ahmadiyyas 
															have been in 
															Bangladesh for 
															nearly a hundred 
															years. There was 
															never any trouble 
															until the 1980s when 
															an organisation 
															called Khatme Nabuat 
															Committee sprang up 
															composed of 
															obscurantists. This 
															group has been 
															gathering strength 
															over the years. They 
															have been attacking 
															Ahmadiyya mosques at 
															various places and 
															have often assaulted 
															and harassed people 
															belonging to 
															Ahmadiyya community. 
															To the utter dismay 
															of the vast majority 
															of the citizen, the 
															government has taken 
															a policy of 
															appeasement that 
															only emboldens the 
															fanatics. </font>
															</p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															On January 10, 2001 
															a rally organised by 
															the Communist Party 
															was attacked in 
															Dhaka, killing 7 
															people. This was 
															followed by an 
															attack on April 14, 
															2001 on the musical 
															soiree organized by 
															Chhayanot at Ramna 
															Park in celebration 
															of the Bengali New 
															Year's day. Islamic 
															extremists were 
															again suspects 
															because they 
															consider communists 
															as &quot;kafirs&quot; and are 
															opposed to the 
															celebration of 
															Bengali New Year. 
															Again on June 3 that 
															year, a church in 
															Baniarchar, 
															Gopalganj was 
															bombed, killing 10 
															worshippers. 
															Christians have been 
															living peacefully 
															for centuries in 
															Bangladesh. They are 
															often some of the 
															poorest in the 
															society, mostly of 
															tribal or schedule 
															caste origin. They 
															never had any 
															conflict or clash of 
															interest with the 
															majority community. 
															The community is not 
															active in mainstream 
															politics. The 
															bombing of a place 
															of worship and 
															killing of so many 
															innocent people put 
															the whole nation to 
															grief. Again, the 
															finger was pointed 
															towards the Islamic 
															extremists who 
															consider the 
															Christians and Jews 
															as enemies. </font>
															</p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															On October 6, 2002, 
															there was 
															simultaneous attack 
															on four cinema halls 
															in Mymensingh that 
															left 21 people dead. 
															It was the day of 
															Eid-ul-Fitr. 
															Traditionally, new 
															movies are released 
															on Eid day 
															throughout the 
															country. People go 
															in large numbers to 
															watch the movies as 
															a part of the Eid 
															festivities. Muslim 
															extremists do not 
															approve of watching 
															movies, even less of 
															watching them on Eid 
															day. In October 
															2002, I saw a number 
															of articles and 
															letters in one of 
															the dailies, known 
															for its 
															fundamentalist 
															views, urging people 
															not to watch movies 
															during Eid and asked 
															the government to 
															close down the 
															cinema halls on Eid 
															day. The bombing 
															that followed was 
															probably aimed at 
															&quot;deviant&quot; Muslims 
															who ignored their 
															warning. </font></p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															Mazars, the tombs of 
															Muslim saints, are 
															also coming under 
															attack. The bombing 
															on January 17, 2003, 
															at Faila Peer Mazar 
															in Tangail left 7 
															dead. Next year, on 
															January 12, 2004, 
															bomb explosion at 
															Hazrat Shah Jalal's 
															Mazar in Sylhet left 
															5 dead. In both 
															bombing, the fakirs, 
															local Sufi singers, 
															were the targets. 
															Although orthodox 
															Muslims do not 
															approve of their 
															presence in the 
															Mazar, they 
															tolerated it. There 
															was peaceful 
															coexistence of 
															orthodox prayer and 
															mystic chanting in 
															all mazars. I 
															visited Hazrat Shah 
															Jalal's Mazar many a 
															time during my 
															childhood years in 
															Sylhet. There was 
															always a corner at 
															the back of the 
															Mazar, left out for 
															the baul fakirs -- 
															some of whom used to 
															take ganja or 
															hashish as a part of 
															their private 
															rituals. Orthodox 
															Muslims never 
															approved it, but 
															until recently, no 
															one ever thought 
															that they should be 
															bombed out. There 
															were large &quot;gojar&quot; 
															fish in a tank in 
															the Mazar premise 
															and people used to 
															feed the fish with a 
															hope that their 
															wishes would be 
															fulfilled. We knew 
															these acts to be 
															superstitions, but 
															never thought that 
															the fish should all 
															be poisoned. But 
															then it happened! 
															Someone killed all 
															the fish by 
															poisoning. </font>
															</p>
															<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															There was a bomb 
															attack again at Shah 
															Jalal's Mazar on May 
															21, 2004. This time 
															it was aimed at the 
															British High 
															Commissioner. He 
															escaped with minor 
															injury while 3 
															others died. The 
															bomb attack on him 
															was a stark reminder 
															of the strength of 
															extremist elements 
															in our midst. The 
															rise of &quot;Bangla 
															Bhai&quot; and the cover 
															up that followed is 
															yet another example 
															of official 
															protection offered 
															to extremist 
															elements by the 
															political high ups. 
															Whereas the Prime 
															Minister ordered the 
															arrest of &quot;Bangla 
															Bhai,&quot; another 
															senior minister of 
															the cabinet said 
															that the journalists 
															had made up &quot;Bangla 
															Bhai&quot; and that he 
															never existed. Since 
															then &quot;Bangla Bhai&quot; 
															is operating free in 
															northern Bangladesh.
															</font></p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															Islam in Bangladesh 
															was garnished with 
															many local 
															traditions. People 
															of all religions 
															used to enjoy the 
															religious 
															celebrations of each 
															other. Then there 
															were cultural events 
															round the year that 
															were secular in 
															nature. These helped 
															to maintain peace 
															and tranquility in 
															Bengali society 
															despite and all the 
															trauma and turmoil 
															that followed 
															partition in 1947. 
															With the emergence 
															of Bangladesh in 
															1971, it was hoped 
															that a truly 
															multi-cultural, 
															multi- religious 
															society would emerge 
															that would shun 
															religious bigotry 
															and move towards 
															establishing a 
															modern democratic 
															society. </font></p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															But since 1980, with 
															the patronage from 
															government and a few 
															Middle Eastern 
															countries, a new 
															breed of religious 
															extremists has 
															gradually emerged. 
															They are intolerant 
															of any view other 
															than their own. In 
															order to establish 
															their religious 
															dogma they would not 
															hesitate to use 
															force. Whoever heard 
															the term &quot;murtaad&quot; 
															before? But now 
															anyone who speaks 
															out against 
															religious bigotry is 
															termed a &quot;murtaad&quot; 
															and hunted down. Dr. 
															Humayun Azad was the 
															latest victim. Who 
															will be next? </font>
															</p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															In Bangladesh today, 
															moderate Islam is 
															being challenged by 
															extremism. Our 
															situation is 
															somewhat similar to 
															that of Indonesia. 
															Islam in Indonesia 
															was, for centuries, 
															a synthesis of local 
															and Islamic culture 
															and traditions. 
															There was never any 
															conflict, until the 
															new breed of 
															extremists started 
															preaching the Wahabi 
															brand of Islam. The 
															Indonesian 
															government was long 
															denying the 
															existence of any 
															militant groups in 
															the country, until 
															Bali bombing -- a 
															catastrophe that 
															came as a shattering 
															blow to the 
															governmental claims.
															</font></p>
															<p align="justify">
															<font face="Verdana">
															Interestingly, in 
															Bangladesh both AL 
															and BNP government 
															seemingly tried to 
															cover up the issues. 
															Not a single 
															incident was 
															properly 
															investigated and 
															people were denied 
															the right to know 
															the fate of the 
															investigations -- 
															irrespective of 
															whether AL or BNP 
															was in power. 
															Whenever anyone 
															spoke of the danger 
															posed by the Islamic 
															militants, the voice 
															was silenced with 
															the excuse that it 
															would smear the 
															national image 
															abroad. It was like 
															nurturing a cancer 
															hoping that it would 
															cure itself. Such 
															denial never pays. I 
															hope the attack on 
															the AL rally on 
															August 21 will help 
															us all to wake up to 
															the danger that is 
															lurking within. One 
															only hopes that both 
															AL and BNP and 
															indeed the whole 
															nation will come 
															together on this 
															issue and confront 
															it squarely before 
															the Frankenstein 
															destroys us all.
