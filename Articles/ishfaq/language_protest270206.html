	<div class="doc-layout-body">
		&nbsp;<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The publication of a 
		series of cartoons of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) in a little known Danish 
		newspaper in September last year has snowballed into outburst of protest 
		from the Muslim community the world over. While the reaction of the vast 
		majority of the Muslims to this despicable event has been one of utter 
		disgust and contempt, they are not on the centre stage. Their peaceful 
		protests do not get the media attention. What the world is watching is 
		the burning down of western embassies and business houses by angry 
		demonstrators. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In many countries, extremist 
		elements of the society are trying to create a law and order situation 
		under the cover of religious fervour. In Iraq, Nigeria and Pakistan, the 
		minority Christians have been attacked and killed and their churches 
		have been burnt down. This was despite the fact that the Churches of all 
		denominations have roundly criticised the cartoon episode. In Bangladesh 
		too, where the Christians are a small, docile minority, a Church in a 
		rural community was attacked. To someone who is not a Muslim, these 
		events and images would only confirm their apprehension that the Muslim 
		community is prone to violence and anarchy. These highly visible acts 
		would further alienate the rest of the world from Islam and the Muslims.
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The chain of events over the 
		last few years is threatening to widen the gap between Islamic world and 
		the rest. Many are arguing that Prof. Samuel P. Huntington was right, 
		after all, when in his seminal paper &quot;The Clash of Civilizations&quot; 
		(Foreign Affairs, Summer 1993) the Professor predicted: &quot;The clash of 
		civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between 
		civilizations will be the battle lines of the future. Conflict between 
		civilizations will be the latest phase in the evolution of conflict in 
		the modern world.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While there were serious 
		objections at that time from the intellectuals and politicians on all 
		sides against such a dire and simplistic conclusion, it now appears that 
		we are indeed heading for such an Armageddon. To many on both sides of 
		the civilizational divide, the clash between Islam and the West is 
		already &quot;on.&quot; </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While we condemn in the 
		strongest terms the demeaning act of publishing the cartoons, we shall 
		have to remember that acts of violence only bolster the hands of those 
		who want to prove that Islam, as a religion, is violent and 
		dysfunctional in the 21st century. This issue is especially critical for 
		Bangladesh. Our international image is already tarnished due to the 
		activities of religious extremists of various hues. The spate of 
		bombings by JMB, an underground pseudo-religious terrorist organisation, 
		has left an indelible mark on the national psyche. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Any act of violence on western 
		life or property will further erode our international standing. We have, 
		over the years, built up a strong economic and political relationship 
		with the West that is of vital interest to our continued growth and 
		prosperity. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Especially, the government and 
		the people of Denmark have been a development partner of Bangladesh 
		since its birth. I remember the first RO-RO ferries that arrived from 
		Denmark soon after the Liberation in 1971, and those played vital role 
		in restoring our war-damaged surface communication systems. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Denmark is one of those few 
		developed countries that had been spending 1 percent or more of its GDP 
		on foreign aid. Although its aid package is not as large as those of 
		Japan or the US, it is aimed at addressing core issues of poverty 
		alleviation and job creation thus ensuring improved standard of living 
		in the recipient country. DANIDA, the Danish aid agency, is a name 
		synonymous with successful rural development, poverty alleviation, 
		irrigation, river training projects that had benefited millions in 
		Bangladesh. Danish investment, although small, has created new jobs and 
		opened up new avenues of growth. We value our friendship with Denmark 
		and an incident of sheer irresponsibility by a section of the press 
		should not hurt the relationship between the two states and their 
		people. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While the saner elements in the 
		society try to defuse and contain the situation, it is also important 
		for us to do some serious soul-searching. We need to ask questions as to 
		why we opt for violence so often, so quick. Why we cannot argue 
		peacefully and logically in a manner that would be emulated by others?
		</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is interesting to note that 
		although the cartoons were printed in September 2005, there was hardly 
		any reaction till January 2006. Just when people were accusing the Saudi 
		and Egyptian governments for their gross failures in the Mina Stampede 
		and the Red Sea Ferry disaster, respectively, the cartoon incident came 
		as a respite for both. The media shifted its focus from the thousands 
		who died needlessly to the cartoons that hardly anybody had seen. </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It has become a daily routine in 
		various Muslim countries for the demonstrators to engage in violent 
		confrontation with the security forces, ending up with few deaths and 
		extensive damage to public and private properties. To top it all, a 
		religious leader in Pakistan declared a bounty on the heads of the 
		cartoon artists. Incidents of this nature only strengthen those who 
		claim that there is a violent streak in Islam. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Take the case of Amina Lawal of 
		northern Nigeria, who gave birth to a child outside marriage in 2002. 
		Sharia court ordered her to be stoned to death for adultery and the 
		punishment would be carried out only after the child has grown out of 
		suckling. This verdict was turned down by the appeals court after a 
		world-wide outrage on this issue. Surprisingly, there was neither a 
		street protest in support of the victim nor a Muslim lawyer of 
		international repute available to defend her. Recently a minor girl 
		named Nazneen has been ordered to be hanged by the Islamic court in Iran 
		for allegedly killing a male assailant. There is a world-wide campaign 
		launched to save the little girl's life. Meanwhile, stoning to death, 
		amputation of limbs, and beheading in public goes on in many Muslim 
		countries at a time when the rest of the world is challenging and 
		re-evaluating the whole concept of crime and punishment. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Over the last few years, a human 
		tragedy, many times larger than Iraq or Palestine, has been going on in 
		Western Sudan's Dharfur region. Hundreds of thousands have been killed, 
		thousands of women have been raped, and millions have been made homeless 
		and facing starvation and death -- all because the victims are black 
		Muslims, former slaves of Arab masters. Sudanese militia of Arab descent 
		were systematically carrying out an ethnic cleansing unknown to the 
		outside world until BBC, CNN and others got the news and flashed it to 
		the world. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What has been the reaction of 
		the Islamic world? Benign neglect -- to say the least! The OIC proved to 
		be impotent to deal with the situation. The UN had to step in with 
		peacekeepers. The UN, along with the western relief agencies, such as 
		Oxfam, is feeding the starving Muslims in Sudanese camps. In Iraq and 
		Pakistan, the Shias and Sunnis are killing each other in the hundreds by 
		bombing each other's mosques, schools, and even funeral prayers. There 
		is an on-going campaign in Bangladesh to declare the Ahmadiyya community 
		as non-Muslims. The Ahmadiyyas are being socially ostracised and often 
		physically abused. What are the cumulative effects of all these? </font>
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Today, the outlook for the 
		Islamic world is bleaker than ever before. As the antagonism between the 
		Islamic world and the rest increases, the access to high-tech knowledge 
		will be shut on our face. Investment and technical cooperation from the 
		West as well as East might decline. Migration, whether in search of job 
		or education, might be increasingly difficult for the Muslims. Of all 
		the major religious communities of the world, the Muslims are the 
		poorest, most backward, and least educated, and consequently least 
		prepared to face the challenges of the 21st century. Among the emerging 
		powers in the world, there is not a single Muslim majority state. Along 
		with the US and EU, the destiny of the 21st century will be shaped by 
		countries such as Russia, China, India, and Japan. Where will the 
		Islamic world be? Will it be in the abyss of violence and anarchy, 
		ignorance and backwardness? Shall we be the pariah shunned by the rest 
		of the world? The onus is on the educated and enlightened Muslims to 
		turn the tide. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Who would be the beneficiaries 
		if the Muslims remain backward? The beneficiaries would be the despotic 
		rulers and the tradition-bound clergy. The two would rather keep the 
		populace backward so that they would be easier to control, manipulate, 
		and exploit. Under tight socio-political and theological control, 
		liberal, modern thoughts are throttled, and conservative, obscurantist 
		ideas are patronized. Democratic traditions cannot flourish under such 
		conditions. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What is the way out? Reformist 
		Islamic scholars around the world are asking for a serious attempt at &quot;ijtihad&quot; 
		-- reasoned struggle and rethinking -- within Islam to seek answers to 
		the problems facing the contemporary world. We need a liberal society 
		that think rationally and interacts with the rest of the world 
		peacefully. Peaceful protests are possible only where democratic culture 
		is nurtured. Until that happens, violence will be the only language of 
		protest in the Islamic world.</font></p>
