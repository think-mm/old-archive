	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">The 
	campaign to declare Ahmadiyya community as &quot;non-Muslims&quot; is going on 
	unabated in various parts of the country. Despite feeble voices of protest 
	from some quarters of the civil society, the religious bigots are virtually 
	having a free run. The general feeling is that as long as one is not an 
	Ahmadi why bother? In the recent conference held in </span>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">Dhaka</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">, 
	the International Khatme Nabuwat Committee showed off their international 
	support by bringing in like-minded religious leaders from </span>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">
	Pakistan</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333"> 
	and some ME countries. Their threat to the Government and the High Court of 
	Bangladesh was unequivocal and unambiguous, &quot;Declare the Ahmadis as 
	non-Muslims or face a blood bath&quot;. In Bogra, a group of stick-wielding 
	religious fanatics forced the authority to cave in to their pressure. The 
	signboard of Ahmadiyya mosque was pulled down and a banner brought by the 
	fanatics was hung instead. This was a repeat show of what happened earlier 
	in Dhaka, Chittagong or Khulna. In all cases, the law enforcers were either 
	silent spectators or actively collaborated with the fanatics.</span></p>
	<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; margin: 5.0pt .5in">
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">Beyond 
	the constitutional and legal question of whether the state has any business 
	to declare a group of people as 'Muslims' or 'non-Muslims', there is the 
	important question of long-term implication of such a decision on the 
	character of state itself. </span>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">
	Pakistan, where the Ahmadiyya conflict originated, can be taken as a case 
	study. Although Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, the Messiah of the Ahmadiyya, was born 
	in Qadian, now in Indian Punjab and hundreds of thousands of his followers 
	are living as Muslims throughout the world, it was in Pakistan that a call 
	was made in 1953 by Maulana Abul Ala Maududi, the founder President of 
	Jamaat-e-Islami, to declare them as non-Muslims. The call emanated more from 
	political expediency than religious fervour. The Ahmadis, although small in 
	number, had a strong position in Pakistan; Lahore had been their stronghold. 
	The foreign minister of Pakistan at the time was Sir Zafarullah Khan, an 
	Ahmadi. So were many top brasses in the bureaucracy and military. Although 
	they were 5% of the population, 20% of the total literate persons were 
	Ahmadi. Maulana Maududi, a refugee from India, had no constituency in </span>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">
	Pakistan</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333"> 
	so he had to create one. The campaign to declare the Ahmadis as 'non-Muslim' 
	gave him his chance. Anti-Ahmadiyya riot swept across Pakistani Punjab. 
	Pakistan, created in the name of Islam, was besmirched within six years of 
	its creation with Muslim blood shed by fellow Muslims. Rioting was 
	particularly severe in Lahore that resulted in the imposition of Martial Law 
	in the city. That was also the beginning of the inroad of military in 
	Pakistan politics. Maududi was arrested, tried in a special military 
	tribunal and sentenced to death in March 1953. The sentence was revoked 
	later only under pressure from countries such as </span>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">Saudi 
	Arabia</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">. 
	The Anti-Ahmadiyya frenzy soon cooled down and there was no trouble till 
	1974. Then a westernised, left-leaning Prime Minister with dubious past, Mr. 
	Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, passed a law declaring the Ahmadis as non-Muslims. 
	Remember the timing 1974. This was a period of deep despair and despondency 
	in Pakistan. The country had recently lost a war, was reduced by half, 
	economy was in shambles and the Pakistani statehood was in question. How do 
	you divert the attention of the masses from the vital issues facing the 
	nation? Blame the minority Ahmadis for all the failures and pitfalls, 
	declare them non-Muslims and throw them out of all public offices was the 
	prescription. Many Ahmedis lost their jobs and business only because of 
	their faith. I remember Air Chief Marshal Zafar Choudhury, then the Chief of 
	Pakistan Air Force, was removed from the office just because of he was an 
	Ahmadi. Dr. Abdus Salam, an Ahmadiyya Muslim and the only Muslim Nobel 
	prizewinner physicist had no place in his own country; he had to die and lay 
	buried in Italy. The Ahmadiyya community fought back with legal suits that 
	went on till 1984 when under the dictatorial regime of General Zia-ul-Haque, 
	the Supreme Court in Pakistan upheld the government order of declaring the 
	Ahmadis as non-Muslims. Soon Ahmadis ceased to exist as a cognisable factor 
	in Pakistan. Did it silence the religious fanatics? The answer is a loud and 
	clear, 'No'. More the government of </span>

	Pakistan</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333"> 
	appeased the religious fanatics, the more strident became their demands. 
	Once the Ahmadis were cornered and virtually eliminated from public life, 
	the attention shifted to the Shias that constitute about 13% of the 
	population of Pakistan. Extremist Sunni clerics declared the Shias as 
	'Kaffirs' and formed 'Jehadi' groups to wage attacks on them. The Shias 
	retaliated with 'Fatwa' from their clerics. The Shia- Sunni clash, unheard 
	of in the early years of Pakistan, soon became regular affairs. The country 
	was thrust into an endless cycle of violence between the two sects. Because 
	the Shias are minority and are economically and politically marginalised, 
	they are mostly at the receiving end. From isolated incidents of violence, 
	the communal clash turned into full-blown urban warfare. Now the suicide 
	bombers have entered the scene. Imagine the hatred generated in the minds of 
	impressionable young men when they think that it is worth blowing themselves 
	up if they could take a number of 'Kaffir' to hell while they enter 
	instantly to the Garden of Eden. Thus we hear frequently of suicide bombers 
	blowing themselves up inside the crowded mosques and shrines. From Gilgit to 
	Karachi, from Quetta to Lahore, the Shia-Sunni clash is ripping </span>

	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">
	Pakistan is the tiny Ismaili sect. Twenty-two Sunni religious organisations 
	in Pakistan have joined together in their campaign to declare the Ismailis 
	as non-Muslims. Interestingly, some of the 'Berlavi' Muslim organisations 
	that were so long considered moderate have joined ranks with the Deobandis 
	in the campaign against the Ismailis. Ismailis are an offshoot of Shia sect, 
	a few million of whom are scattered across the globe. Two further offshoots 
	of the Ismailis, known as the Agha Khanis and the Bohras, are especially 
	concentrated in urban centres of the sub-continent. The communities are 
	small but well knit, educated, urbane and westernised in their outlook. They 
	concentrate on business and industries rather than on politics, bureaucracy 
	or military. Some of the biggest financial institutions in Pakistan are 
	owned by the Ismailis. Because they maintain low profile in politics, they 
	had for so long missed the attention of the religious fanatics. But now it 
	is their turn to face the wrath. The Government in Pakistan is now faced 
	with a new problem that would have enormous economic implications, if not 
	political fallout.<br>
	We in </span>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">
	Bangladesh</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333"> 
	should not ignore the hard lessons learnt in Pakistan; similar act is being 
	played out here. By banning Ahmadiyya publications, the government has 
	already acknowledged the fact that there exists a prima facie case for 
	intervention by the state. Thankfully, the High Court nullified that order. 
	Let us assume that the government succumb to the pressure and declare the 
	Ahmadis as non-Muslims. What will be the implications? It will open up the 
	&quot;Pandora's Box&quot; as in </span>

	Pakistan</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333">. 
	Tomorrow another group might come out to declare the Shias as non-Muslims. 
	They might seize Shia mosques and 'Imambaras' and put up signboards warning 
	Muslims not to enter those places. This year, for the first time in 
	Bangladesh, we had a grenade attack on a Muharram programme. Thankfully, no 
	one was hurt. The Shias are too few in numbers in Bangladesh to react 
	violently as they do in Pakistan, but our relations with countries such as 
	Iran will be strained no doubt. We have small numbers of Ismailis in 
	Bangladesh, mostly engaged in business, trade and industries. They would be 
	scared at the recent turn of events. There are different sects even among 
	Sunni Muslims that widely differ in theological beliefs and practices. 
	Deobandis and Berlavis have serious differences between them and often call 
	each other 'deviants' or even 'Kaffirs'. Deobandi extremists are suspected 
	of attacks in 'Mazars' and 'Dargahs', which are venerated by the Berlavi 
	devotees. There has been many such bombings in </span>

	and Bangladesh in recent days. If the state joins in the fray and starts 
	labelling different sects as 'non-Muslims', soon there will not be many 
	Muslims left. Can we imagine what era of darkness we are heading into?</span></p>
