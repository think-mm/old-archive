		The International Conference of Islamic Scholars held in Dhaka 
		(September 23-25) was a commendable effort by the organisers to 
		highlight the humane face of Islam and condemn the violent trend that is 
		attempting to occupy the centre stage. However, the conference, held in 
		the China-Bangladesh Friendship Conference Centre, was high in pomp and 
		grandeur, but low in popular enthusiasm. While the participants in the 
		capital's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar were emphasising the message of peace and 
		goodwill in Islam, just a mile away, a crowd of violent Friday 
		worshippers were attempting to march on the Ahmadia Mosque in Nakhalpara 
		area. Those preaching moderation inside the ornate Conference Hall were 
		not audible outside. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Speakers in the conference were 
		eulogising Bangladesh as &quot;a moderate Muslim state.&quot; This is a term 
		coined by the Americans in the 90s, and our politicians and 
		intellectuals parrot it like a <i>mantra</i>. The question is, &quot;If some 
		are moderate Muslim states, then are there others who are extreme?&quot; How 
		do we categorise? What are the criteria that determine 'moderates' and 
		'extremes'? Can we call countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran or Pakistan 
		'extreme'? How do we interact with 'extreme' states? There is no answer 
		to these questions. In fact, we should shun such labels. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Instead, we should emphasise 
		that Bangladesh is a democratic country, the majority of whose 
		population are Muslim by religion, just as they are Bengali by 
		ethnicity, or agriculturists by profession, and so on. When we say 
		Bangladesh belongs to Islamic Ummah (Nation), we straight away deprive 
		at least 10 per cent of our population of their nationhood. We can never 
		build a cohesive nation keeping a significant segment of the population 
		out of the mainstream. If Bangladeshi Muslims belong to &quot;Islamic 
		nation,&quot; then could Bangladeshi Hindus, Buddhists or Christians or other 
		indigenous nationalities seek their own religious nationhood? These 
		interesting questions need to be addressed in our nation-building 
		exercise. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During the conference, there was 
		the usual &quot;Bush-Blair&quot; bashing, accusing the West of fomenting violence 
		and extremism in the Islamic world. While there is some truth in it, I 
		would request our Islamic scholars to first clean up our own backyard. 
		Let us start by eliminating extremism at home. Why our Islamic scholars 
		do not condemn violence against the Ahmadia community clearly and 
		unequivocally? Some <i>maulanas</i> of rather obscure origin are gaining 
		the centre stage by fomenting unrest and instability in the country. 
		They have issued ultimatum to the government to declare the Ahmadias as 
		Non-Muslims; otherwise, there would be trouble ahead. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the list of speakers in the 
		Anti-Ahmadia rally on October 1, beside <i>maulanas</i> from Pakistan, 
		there was a <i>peer</i> from India. It is surprising to note that the <i>
		peer</i> traveled to Bangladesh to press his demand, whereas in his own 
		country, India, there is no such clamour, and Ahmadia Muslims are living 
		in India in peace and harmony. In fact, some time back, I watched on one 
		of the Indian TV news channels, a huge gathering of Ahmadias from all 
		over the world in Qadian, a town in the Indian state of Punjab, which is 
		the birthplace of Mirza Ghulam Ahmed, the founder of the Ahmadia 
		community. I would urge upon the venerable peer from India to first 
		issue ultimatum to his own government before demanding the same from 
		ours. I would also ask our government to refuse entry to troublemakers 
		from abroad. Governments all over the world are tightening the control 
		on the movement of people who preach religious extremism. We should do 
		the same. </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">While commending the effort of 
		projecting the moderate image of Bangladesh, let me cite a few anomalies 
		amidst us. The issue of criticising or speaking ill of other religion by 
		our Imams comes to my mind first. Some of our Imams in their Friday 
		prayers seek victory against idol-worshipers, Jews, and Christians. I 
		wonder whether it is the right thing to do while we have Hindus, 
		Buddhists and Christians as citizens of Bangladesh. When the Imams speak 
		against other religions, are they not hurting the sentiments of fellow 
		citizens? Until about a decade ago, such utterances were unheard of; but 
		these are becoming increasingly common now. </font></p>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">How can we foster communal 
		harmony and friendship if our religious leaders keep on preaching from 
		the pulpit against members of other religions? We are witnessing the 
		fallout of such preaching in our national life. Here is an example. In 
		our childhood days, Durga Puja was occasions of great joy and 
		festivities for all -- Hindus and Muslims. No one ever thought of 
		violence or disturbance in the Puja celebration. Now, we have to create 
		a security blanket, mobilise all the security apparatus so that the Puja 
		celebration can go ahead unhindered. How can one freely enjoy the 
		festivities if the mind is preoccupied with the thoughts of personal 
		safety and security? Despite various security measures, we are getting 
		news of Puja sites in different parts of the country being vandalised by 
		miscreants at night. Is it not a national shame? Why are our Islamic 
		scholars silent about it? </font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">What to speak of other 
		religions, even Islamic religious functions are now under threat of 
		violence. Bombing in Dargahs and Urs ceremonies across the country have 
		been an agonising experience for all of us. When I saw the picture in 
		the newspaper of the Friday congregation in Baitul Mukarram with armed 
		guards standing on all vantage points, it made me sick all over. What a 
		state of terror we are sinking into. I wonder if we are heading the way 
		of Pakistan, where mosque bombing is routine, where sectarian violence, 
		abetted by religious leaders, kills hundreds every year. Pakistan is a 
		perfect example of the folly of mixing religion with politics -- look 
		what a morass that has led their nation into. I hope our Islamic 
		scholars would face up to address these issues -- the issues of 
		religious intolerance and bigotry nearer at home, instead of directing 
		futile attacks on the Bush-Blair axis.</font></p>
