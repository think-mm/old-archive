									<a href="http://www.thedailystar.net/2005/01/31/d50131020531.htm">
									&quot;Letter from America&quot; by Dr. Fakhruddin 
									Ahmed</a> that appeared in the Daily Star on 
									January 31. In that column, Dr. Ahmed 
									challenged the article written by Ms. Eliza 
									Griswold in the New York Times in December 
									2004 on the threat of Islamic militancy in 
									Bangladesh. While I appreciate the 
									forthright stand taken by Dr. Ahmed on an 
									issue that is of vital concern to all of us, 
									I cannot but contradict a number of 
									statements that he made and factual errors 
									that he presented. </font></p>
									<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. 
									Ahmed does not agree with Ms. Griswold's 
									statement: &quot;In Bangla Bhai's patch of 
									northwestern Bangladesh, poverty is so 
									pervasive that, for many children in the 
									region, privately subsidised madrassas are 
									the only educational option.&quot; According to 
									him, &quot;those who go to madrassa choose to do 
									so and in any case the numbers of students 
									in the madrassa are negligible.&quot; Is it 
									really so? Northwestern Bangladesh is indeed 
									economically the most backward in the 
									country -- poverty is endemic there and we 
									are all too familiar with the annual monga 
									or famine that visits the area. Indeed, dire 
									poverty and destitution are boosting the 
									extremist elements of all varieties in that 
									area. Children are the first victims of 
									poverty. Although successive governments 
									have taken steps to encourage enrolment in 
									mainstream schools, thousands of school-age 
									children stay outside the net. Ms. Griswold 
									is right when she says that for the very 
									poor and destitute children, madrassas are 
									often the only option open. </font></p>
									<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The 
									number of madrassas in Bangladesh is 
									increasing at a phenomenal pace and so is 
									the number of students. According to 
									government published sources (BANBEIS), 
									during 1980-2000, the number of registered 
									junior and high madrassas increased by 271 
									per cent compared to 185 per cent growth of 
									secondary schools. During the same period, 
									the number of students in junior and high 
									madrassas increased by 818 per cent compared 
									to only 317 per cent growth of secondary 
									school students. Today, 30 per cent of all 
									secondary level students are from madrassas 
									and they are catching up fast. These 
									statistics do not include thousands of 
									unregistered &quot;Quomi&quot; madrassas all over the 
									country, nor does it include English medium 
									&quot;Cadet Madrassas&quot; that are sprouting up in 
									urban areas. Therefore, Dr. Ahmed's claim 
									that &quot;the numbers of madrassa students are 
									negligible&quot; is not based on fact. </font>
									</p>
									<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. 
									Ahmed states, &quot;Because of their lack of 
									formal education, no madrassa educated man 
									holds any position of influence in the 
									bureaucracy.&quot; This statement is also not 
									based on fact. While the career choices of 
									the students of traditional &quot;Quomi&quot; 
									madrassas remain extremely limited, those 
									from the government recognised ones are now 
									streaming on to various disciplines. They 
									are especially prominent in the education 
									sector. Large numbers of madrassa students 
									are getting into every cadre of 
									administration and will soon be able to 
									exercise significant influence in the 
									statecraft. Successive governments 
									encouraged the growth of madrassa education 
									in the country. Over the last two decades, 
									revenue expenditure per madrassa student was 
									much more than for the students in secondary 
									high schools. </font></p>
									<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I 
									disagree with the assertion by Dr. Ahmed 
									that there is nothing like &quot;Deobandi Islam.&quot; 
									Indeed, Sunni Islam in the sub-continent has 
									many &quot;Tariqas&quot; such as Deobandi, Berlevi, 
									Chistia, Quaderia, etc. These Tariqas vary 
									significantly in their interpretation of 
									religious doctrine. Contrary to Dr. Ahmed's 
									assertion that the Deoband School was the 
									result of &quot;forward looking movement&quot; and not 
									reactionary, &quot;Darul Ulum Deoband&quot; was a 
									reaction to the establishment of 
									Anglo-Oriental College (later Aligarh Muslim 
									University) in Aligarh by Sir Syed Ahmed 
									Khan. The Deobandis reject modern scientific 
									and technical education and hope to push the 
									clock back to the medieval days. They are an 
									obscurantist brand for whom &quot;Communicating 
									in English, wearing of coat, trousers, 
									shorts, tie, eating with knife and fork etc 
									etc are haram (prohibited).&quot; Deobandis 
									believe all forms of music, songs, dances, 
									TV, cinema, radio are unIslamic. They still 
									follow the &quot;Darse Nizamia&quot; -- a syllabus 
									prepared by Grand Vizier Nizaum-ud-dawla in 
									Baghdad in the 11th century. Most of the &quot;Quomi&quot; 
									madrassas in the sub-continent are run on 
									the Deobandi line. A Deobandi madrassa at 
									Akora Khattak in NWFP, Pakistan caught 
									international attention in recent years. 
									Most of the Taliban leadership in 
									Afghanistan graduated from this, otherwise 
									inconspicuous, madrassa. So, Deobandi Islam 
									is there and still kicking. </font></p>
									<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dr. 
									Ahmed wanted to whitewash Maulana Maududi by 
									quoting Karen Armstrong. We all know what 
									the Maulana stood for. Maududi opposed 
									Pakistan movement because in his vision the 
									whole of India should have been <i>Dar-ul 
									Islam</i>, not just a part of it. Once in 
									Pakistan, he raised the issue of declaring 
									Ahmadiyyas as non-Muslim that started a riot 
									in Punjab in 1954. The government imposed 
									martial law in Lahore to control the 
									violence. A special tribunal sentenced 
									Maududi to death for instigating rioting; 
									the sentence was later commuted. It is true, 
									Maududi was not a Deobandi, but he was the 
									forerunner of what is now described as &quot;<b>political 
									Islam</b>.&quot; He founded the Jamaat-e-Islami 
									in Pakistan, and actively collaborated with 
									the military regime during the Bangladesh 
									War in 1971. The rest is common knowledge.
									</font></p>
									<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I 
									wonder how Dr. Ahmed came to the conclusion 
									that &quot;Over the last few decades, 
									Bangladeshis in general have become more 
									secular.&quot; The truth is to the contrary. 
									Secularism as a state principle was dropped 
									from the constitution. The constitution was 
									amended more than once to enhance its 
									Islamic character. Islam is now the state 
									religion. On the political front, the 
									Islamic parties are on the rise. Religious 
									bigots are demanding that the Ahmadiyyas be 
									declared non-Muslims, just as in Pakistan. 
									On the societal level, many of the age-old 
									Bengali cultures and traditions are now 
									under threat. Bombs are hurled in the cinema 
									halls, circus, and Jatra shows. After the 
									recent spate of bombings of Jatra shows, 
									government, instead of providing protection 
									or nabbing the culprits, stopped all Jatra 
									performance throughout the country. That was 
									exactly what the religious extremists were 
									demanding. Those who raise their voice are 
									declared <i>murtaad</i> (heretic). Dr. Ahmed 
									Sharif, Poet Shamsur Rahman, and Dr. Humayun 
									Azad have each faced the brunt. Now it is 
									the turn for Dr. Kamal Hossain. Are we 
									becoming more secular? </font></p>
									<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">
									Killing of Mr. SAMS Kibria has once again 
									exposed the vulnerable law and order 
									situation in the country. The whole civil 
									society is under threat. We are indeed 
									passing through a critical time. While we 
									must vigorously defend Bangladesh abroad, we 
									cannot be oblivious of the growing danger at 
									home. In these days of Internet and global 
									communications, we cannot hide our 
									vulnerabilities. If we cannot deal with our 
									situation, there will be others to take care 
									of us. Look what happened to Sudan in Darfur 
									affairs. Dr. Ahmed's quoting of the 
									incidents of racial discrimination in the US 
									will not help us. If we wish to live with 
									dignity and honour, we must get our house in 
									order.</font><table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="0" width="100%" border="0">
