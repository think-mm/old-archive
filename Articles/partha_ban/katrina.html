	New Orleans' Bangladeshi Immigrants </b></font></p>
	<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#000080">Partha Banerjee </font></p>
	<p align="center">Weekly Kagoj (Bengali), September 7-13 </p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">When Hurricane Katrina hit New 
	Orleans and destroyed the city on August 29, it also devastated the city's 
	thousands of immigrants and their lives. Many of these immigrants came to 
	the U.S. from countries ravaged by Katrina-type storms and their aftermaths. 
	Now, they are faced with similar experiences, all over again. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Bangladeshi immigrants of New 
	Orleans are one community that got wrecked. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We see this back there all the 
	time: havocs, misery because of the big monsoon storms. We never believed 
	we'd see such a catastrophe here that turns our lives upside down,&quot; said 
	Moti, an undocumented immigrant from Sylhet, Bangladesh. He would not 
	disclose his full name. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Moti fled Metairie, a northern 
	suburb of downtown New Orleans the Sunday before the hurricane struck. He 
	left behind all the belongings in his first-floor apartment that was 
	inundated with five or six-foot-deep water. He doesn't believe he'll be able 
	to put his life back together soon. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">He believes many others like him had 
	a similar fate. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I didn't have much in the first 
	place,&quot; he said. &quot;But now, I don't even know where to begin. I lost it all.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Bangladeshi students attending 
	various schools including Tulane University also left the Orleans Parish en 
	masse the day before the city was evacuated. Most of them are now staying at 
	friends' or relatives' in Houston, Texas, Jackson, Mississippi, Mobile, 
	Alabama, or Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Apart from losing their belongings that 
	include books, term papers, bikes and blankets, these students also lost 
	their meager income, which worries them a lot. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Students' biggest worry is though, 
	if New Orleans is shut down for a long time and they can't go back to their 
	schools designated by immigration [authorities], they'll be considered 
	illegal, without valid papers,&quot; Md. Shahed, a part-time Tulane Student, 
	said. International students study in U.S. at schools specifically mentioned 
	on their I-20 immigration papers. Under normal circumstances, while on their 
	student visa, they're not allowed to study anywhere else. They're not 
	allowed to work outside, either. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I think these students should be 
	relocated properly just like any other American students [impacted by 
	Katrina],&quot; Mamud, another student at Tulane, said. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shahed fled New Orleans in the nick 
	of time only to find himself and some twenty other students huddled in a 
	Bengali doctor's house in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, a town that took the hit 
	of the deadly hurricane's eye. He thought out of an estimated 1,000 
	Bangladeshis in Greater New Orleans, a few long-time immigrants lost 
	everything. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">According to him, a couple of 
	doctors living close to the instate highway near the hurricane eye saw their 
	houses completely blown away. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We're lucky to have survived,&quot; 
	Shahed said. &quot;But [in spite of the] generosity provided to us, it's not the 
	happiest situation. We have to find a way to put our lives back together 
	soon,&quot; he said. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Shahed described how the city 
	residents and its immigrant students did not really get any serious warning 
	about the oncoming storm. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Tulane students just got one five- 
	or 10-minute alarm, and basically that's it,&quot; he said. &quot;We were playing 
	soccer with a bunch of kids even on Saturday. Never thought it was going to 
	be so bad.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Two days later, Hurricane Katrine 
	walloped the city. New Orleans residents, who are used to relocating to 
	nearby places at hearing official warnings, did not know what was coming at 
	them.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We moved to Houston three or four 
	times before,&quot; Mariam Nessa, a Bangladeshi immigrant mother from Kenner, 
	another suburb of New Orleans, said. On Sunday, just the day before the 
	hurricane stormed the city, she left with her husband and child for Houston 
	again, to stay with some friends. This time, however, she doesn't know when 
	she can go back to her home, if ever again. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;They tell us now that we can go 
	check on our home in Kenner, but I'm afraid we'd get mugged or something if 
	we went,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't know what to do. They say houses are being 
	vandalized and the water to drink is not safe. I have a child and I'm 
	afraid.&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Hurricane Katrina impacted Bengali 
	immigrants in Baton Rouge, a city about 50 miles northwest of New Orleans.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Our population has suddenly gone up 
	twice, three times because of the people who escaped New Orleans and came 
	here,&quot; Khasruzzaman Chowdhury, a university professor, said. &quot;This is 
	unprecedented -- traffic jams and all. Where are they going to put up so 
	many people in grave needs?&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Chowdhury and his family had no 
	electricity for nearly a week since Katrina hit Louisiana. &quot;We moved from 
	friends' to friends' to eat because we have an electric oven and couldn't 
	cook,&quot; he said. &quot;But our discomfort is negligible compared to theirs,&quot; he 
	agreed. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Chowdhury and his wife are now 
	helping Bangladeshi and other South Asian immigrants to rehabilitate. He's 
	using his connections to help those who need it. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We're also reaching out to other 
	poor communities,&quot; he said. &quot;I have students from poor families and they're 
	in serious trouble.&quot;</font></p>
