	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><u>One: The Outer 
	World</u></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The entire world 
	was shocked when terrorists blew up the World Trade Center. The world’s 
	humanity condemned the attacks, mourned the dead and then, gradually made 
	room for a serious self-introspection.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, the 
	United States, its political establishment with its two so-called mainstream 
	parties and their partner big media refrained from the latter. In other 
	words, they did not take on any somber analyses of the causes behind such 
	gruesome violence. No meaningful investigation into the social, economic and 
	political reasons behind the grave disaster took place.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Only Bill Clinton 
	made a passing comment at a Georgetown University convocation that the U.S. 
	itself had a long history of terrorism. He said terrorism in this country 
	began during the slave trade two centuries ago. Clinton said, “this country 
	is now repaying the price for it.”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">September 11, 2001 
	radically changed the socio-economic environment of America and the world. 
	This country has ushered into a new era of unilateral war, killing and 
	subjugation. Thousands of innocent civilians died in U.S. bombing campaign 
	in Afghanistan, thousands more are going to be killed in Iraq soon. 
	Following familiar models, big multinational corporations have planned 
	economic and political invasion into “enemy countries,” especially the ones 
	Bush has termed the Axis of Evil. The ruling class of America has bestowed 
	upon itself the responsibility to determine which nations and nationalities 
	are evil terrorists and which are not.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><u>Two: The World 
	Within</u></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The political 
	exploitation of the World Trade Center tragedies is in full swing, of which 
	domestic fear mongering and repression are now two key elements. Public 
	brainwashing and throttling of dissent actively continue via the corporate 
	media, political status quo, right wing “think tanks” and their numerous 
	spokespersons. Lawmakers from both Republican and Democratic parties have 
	first confirmed far-right wing Attorney General Ashcroft and now his 
	unprecedented repressive laws and measures such as the USA Patriot Act and 
	Special Registrations – just the way they have endorsed the 
	Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld doctrine of unilateral and pre-emptive war doctrine. 
	The legal measures are about to destroy America’s historic framework of 
	democracy and diversity within and its land-of-the-free image outside.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Only a handful of 
	progressive media organizations and outlets have taken a firm stand against 
	such anti-people, undemocratic practices. However, The Nation, Radio 
	Pacifica, Z-Net, The Progressive, Mother Jones or Village Voice, in spite of 
	their gallant and flagship, honest journalism, are losing ground rapidly to 
	the aggressive, arrogant, corporate-funded “mainstream” and jingoist media.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Recently, 
	international organization Human Rights Watch reported the names of certain 
	countries that it believed followed the U.S. “anti-terrorism” model to 
	silence dissent elsewhere. The report was picked up and relayed throughout 
	the nation by American Broadcasting Corporation. The only fact, however, 
	that ABC TV forgot to mention is that this model has had a sinister 
	implementation within America itself. Human Rights Watch had reported that 
	other than USA, countries such as China, Russia, Egypt, Ujbekistan, etc. 
	have actively pursued the U.S. model and violently repressed dissent. The 
	report mentioned that just after the terrorist attacks, nearly 1,200 Muslim 
	men were rounded up and detained, without any terrorism charges, by FBI, 
	Immigration and Naturalization Services and Department of Homeland Security. 
	The government would not even disclose their identities or the prison 
	locations where they have been held. The American Civil Liberties Union, 
	Amnesty International and other rights and justice organizations and their 
	lawyers have failed to gain access to government documents behind such 
	arrests. The official view has been that the documents deserve to be 
	undisclosed at this time of “war against terrorism.”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The mainstream 
	U.S. TV have failed to report that these detainees are not terrorists and do 
	not deserve such treatment. They have not reported that these prisoners have 
	become victims of state-sponsored hate and racism. They have not mentioned 
	that their families have been torn apart because of the gross injustice 
	practiced by a so-called civilized nation and its rulers.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">ACLU has expressed 
	its serious concerns that these repressive measures are not going to be 
	limited for Muslim men only. The organization has warned the American people 
	that this is just a preview of what other measures are yet to come that 
	would completely destroy the democratic fabric of this country. It is widely 
	believed by immigrant activists that these detainees are the new scapegoats 
	to deflect peoples’ attention from the failures of the ruling class. 
	Progressive and conscientious Americans believe this scenario is a replay of 
	other such historical events such as the persecution of innocent 
	Japanese-Americans in the forties, McCarthyism in the fifties, crushing the 
	civil rights movement in the sixties or the Red Scare of the seventies and 
	eighties. History is only repeating itself.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><u>Three: Who is a 
	Terrorist?</u></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Who is a terrorist 
	and who is going to define terrorism? The extremist, fanatic Taliban or Al 
	Quaida are unquestionably terrorists and tyrants. Their role in the various 
	social arenas, especially on women’s and children’s issues, education, 
	science, freedom and rights, has been despicable. Similarly, the violent 
	attacks on the Indian parliament house or Hindu temples are terrorist acts; 
	so are the mass killings of Muslim civilians by Hindu fanatics in Gandhi’s 
	Gujarat. We do not spare any words to condemn the destruction of innocent 
	lives on September 11. Many more lives will perhaps be lost because of the 
	unclean, toxic and dangerous environment around Ground Zero: lives of 
	residents and poor day laborers who were forced by federal and state 
	government agencies to return to live and work there; of Ground Zero area 
	students who were sent back to school by New York City government when the 
	WTC fire was still burning. One terrorist attack on the American soil has 
	changed the lives of millions of Americans forever.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Question is, does 
	anyone have the carte blanche to determine and define terrorism? Sixty 
	thousand innocent lives were lost in Hiroshima when a U.S. military plane 
	named Enola Gay dropped the atomic bomb on the Japanese city in 1945. How 
	many millions were killed because of U.S. government’s and Henry Kissinger’s 
	vendetta in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia? How many million lives were destroyed 
	by U.S.-supported dictators and tyrant rulers in Indonesia, Chile, El 
	Salvador, Turkey or Bangladesh? How many more millions worldwide were 
	victims of multinational U.S. corporations such as Enron, Union Carbide, 
	Mobil, Exxon, Disney or General Electric and their insatiable greed? Who 
	would determine that these acts have not been synonymous with terrorism?</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The Iraq war is 
	imminent and a long, clandestine preparation is near completion. In a 
	shameless defiance of massive peace protests throughout the world, this war 
	mongering government is hell bent to bomb and destroy the ancient land of 
	Babylon on Tigris and Euphrates. Who is next in line for destruction – is it 
	North Korea, the Phillippines, or is it Syria? Nobody knows; the American 
	people certainly don’t. Isn’t this how George Orwell envisioned Big Brother 
	and his never-ending war in “1984?”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The attacks of 
	September 11 were barbaric and cowardly. Likewise, the forcible imposition 
	of war, bombing, killing and elimination of oppositions and dissent in the 
	worlds within and without are another kind of terror. Under the guise of the 
	“war against terrorism,” a dark, ominous cloud of global war and extreme 
	repression is rapidly engulfing us.</font></p>
