	90211 </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">February 1, 2005 </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Dear Executive Director: </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Subject: Nominations for the 77th 
	Annual Academy Awards: Born Into Brothels </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Your announced nominations for the 
	upcoming 77th Annual Academy Awards include in the Best Documentary Feature 
	section &quot;Born into Brothels&quot; (THINKFilm, A Red Light Films, Inc. Production, 
	by Ross Kauffman and Zana Briski). I have been actively involved with the 
	making of the documentary especially in its post-production stage. As a 
	documentary filmmaker, a Columbia University-trained journalist-turned- 
	activist and an avid admirer of the medium of film and motion pictures, I am 
	deeply concerned that the nominations committee has perhaps overlooked some 
	of the probable, serious flaws contained within the film – both ethical and 
	stylistic. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In your official synopsis, the film 
	is described as follows: &quot;While documenting the experiences of prostitutes 
	in Calcutta's red-light district, photojournalist Zana Briski befriended 
	many of their children and decided to provide them with a chance to record 
	images from their own lives. Supplied with cameras by Briski, the children 
	present a portrait of their harsh world that is both unique and insightful.&quot;
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The above is indeed true. And I 
	don't have any problems finding credit for Ms. Briski and Mr. Kauffman for 
	the time they took to live with and befriend the poor children. However, I 
	take issues with the often-explicit presumption by both the filmmakers and 
	the U.S. media personalities (including the nominators at AMPAS) that the 
	efforts by Ms. Briski and Mr. Kauffman were able to uplift the children from 
	the poverty and destitution they live in. In fact, that presumption is not 
	true. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I visited these children a number of 
	times during the last couple of years and found out that almost all the 
	children are now living even a worse life than they were in before Ms. 
	Briski began working with them. The children's despair has exacerbated 
	because they'd hoped that with active involvement in Ms. Briski's camera 
	project, there would be an opportunity for them to live a better life. At 
	the same time, their sex worker parents believed that with so much 
	unrestricted access to their secretive lives they had provided to the 
	filmmakers, and that too, so generously (were their written consent ever 
	requested and received by the filmmakers?), there would be a way their 
	children would also be sharing some of the glories the filmmakers are now 
	shining in. Alas, very likely, they don't even know that their misery, 
	helplessness and traumas are now being widely exposed and exploited to find 
	fame and prosperity. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Further, the film forgets to mention 
	that Calcutta is a city where its red-light district is a safe refuge for 
	its sex workers and their trade. With help from hundreds of Calcuttan 
	activists, social workers and medical practitioners, Sonagachi (the district 
	depicted in the film) has become synonymous with many struggles won by its 
	inhabitants (for one, the HIV rate among sex workers in Sonagachi is 
	remarkably low: 5% compared to 80% in Mumbai). These sex workers and their 
	activist comrades have set up -- however rudimentary -- financial 
	institutions, health clinics, sex education schools and blood banks in that 
	labyrinth of alleys that would otherwise be ignored and rejected by the 
	other side of Calcutta and its elite doctors, artists, poets, filmmakers and 
	politicians (and I must say, I was one of this other side for more than 
	twenty five years of my life before I moved into U.S.). The conjecture drawn 
	by the makers of Born into Brothels that it was only them that were 
	responsible for any humanity and benevolence doled out to these children and 
	their parents is simply absurd. &quot;It takes a village…&quot; </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Stylistically, the documentary is in 
	fact a mix of real and fictitious shots and scenarios, the latter being 
	abundant throughout the film. This makes me question the legitimacy of the 
	film being labeled as a documentary and not a fiction. A plethora of glitzy, 
	Bombay-film-industry (i.e., Bollywood) music has been used to editorialize 
	the film, which is troubling. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">The most troubling, however, is the 
	use of the final piece of music that ends the &quot;documentary&quot; with an apparent 
	melodramatic note. This piece (it was in there at the time the film was 
	premiered at New York City's Museum of Radio and Television in 2004) has 
	been directly &quot;lifted&quot; from the celebrated Calcuttan film maestro, 
	Oscar-winning Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy finale. Is Ms. Briski or Mr. 
	Kauffman aware of this serious digression? </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">It is not my wish to personally 
	tarnish the directors and producers of Born into Brothels and I apologize 
	profusely in the event my assertions are found untrue. However, I am 
	troubled by the nominations and eulogies heaped upon the film without some 
	serious re-examination. We Calcutta-born Americans who crave for high art 
	and creativity are already much-undermined by many other attempts to 
	relegate our beloved city into ignominy. My opinion is that the present 
	so-called documentary is the latest addition to that series of gross 
	misrepresentations. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thank you for your kind attention.

	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Anointed 
		by an Oscar and feted on the celebrity circuit, Zana Briski and Ross 
		Kauffman are flying well above the mean streets of Sonagachi, Calcutta's 
		red-light district, where their award-winning documentary Born Into 
		Brothels is set. Briski, in a backless gown, blew a kiss from the Oscar 
		stage across the oceans to the &quot;kids&quot; she said were watching in 
		Calcutta. The big smile heralded the big times for the photographer and 
		her co-director, now armed with the coveted statuette for their entire 
		filmmaking life, thanks to the children and women of the city of joy.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Born Into 
		Brothels is being hailed in the West as the ultimate uplifting film, a 
		&quot;humanitarian&quot; effort by Briski who dared to live amid the squalor. 
		Western critics and audiences are taken up by the British-born 
		photographer's knight-in-shining-armour efforts. Some of the children 
		too are happy she got the award. The film is about the &quot;missionary zeal&quot; 
		with which she tried to save seven kids from their environment in 
		Sonagachi. And from Calcutta, a city ever fascinating to &quot;white&quot; 
		saviours, from Mother Teresa to Dominique Lapierre and now Briski.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">The film 
		centres around Briski's efforts to improve the lives of some children 
		she befriended in 1997 while trying to document the lives of sex workers 
		in Calcutta. Unable to fulfil her original goal, she shifted her focus 
		to the kids, giving them cameras and basic lessons in photography. The 
		children take telling shots of their surroundings which Briski later 
		used for exhibitions and a Sotheby's auction in 2001 to raise money. 
		Amnesty International used a photo for its 2003 calendar. Flush with 
		grants, she created 'Kids With Cameras', a charitable organisation to 
		help the children.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">But Born 
		Into Brothels won't be shown in India. At a recent screening in 
		Washington, Kauffman said the sex workers whose children feature in the 
		film don't want it to be shown in India. The filmmakers want to protect 
		their identities. Really? After an Oscar and a relentless run of the 
		festival circuit, the issue of maintaining anonymity seems far-fetched.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">The 
		decision, whatever its merit, has already led to serious questioning of 
		the filmmakers' intent. Is it because Indian audiences and reviewers 
		might take issue with Briski's &quot;intervention&quot; in the lives of some of 
		the most unfortunate? Members of the Durbar Women's Coordination 
		Committee, an organisation of Sonagachi's sex workers, are unhappy about 
		Briski's high-handed decision. Sandhya Dutta, who helped Briski and 
		lives in Sonagachi, told a Calcutta newspaper she felt &quot;used&quot; twice over 
		because people in other countries were watching a film about their lives 
		while she couldn't.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Some 
		critics are also asking whether the duo obtained legal permission from 
		the sex workers whose innermost lives and conflicts they exposed, 
		sometimes through the kids. One such child, Puja, enrolled in Briski's 
		photography class, clicks people who clearly don't want to be 
		photographed. The photos appear in the film, raising troubling questions 
		about consent. If Sonagachi residents do not want to be immortalised on 
		film by one of their own, they surely wouldn't want to be exposed to a 
		worldwide bazaar of gawkers.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">The 
		children in the film come across as children anywhere—likeable and 
		friendly. They seem to have implicit faith in 'Zana Aunty' who shepherds 
		them around, even taking one specially talented boy to Amsterdam for a 
		photo contest after struggling to get him a passport. The film crosses 
		the line from documentation to activism but no one knows whether the 
		interventions helped or hampered the subjects.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">In the 
		end, the film seems more about Briski's journey and less about the hard 
		reality of prostitution and the effects of her interference in young 
		lives. It tugs at the heart but leaves the head relatively untouched. 
		Intentionally or not, Briski is the noble soul in the film, faced with 
		the mountain of Indian bureaucracy, teaching the children photography, 
		trying to move them to good schools, getting them tested for aids and 
		taking them to the zoo. The film's self-congratulatory tone thickens as 
		it progresses through 'Zana Aunty's' triumphs and travails, making us 
		wonder who the real subject is.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">The film 
		also gives the impression that besides Briski, no one wants or is trying 
		to improve the squalid scenario, that Indians are unaware and blind to 
		the cancer within. The film's paternalistic tone has evoked a response 
		here. Most Western reviewers have seen Briski's effort in the light she 
		cast for them. The New York Times called the film &quot;moving, charming and 
		sad, a tribute to Ms Briski's indomitability and to the irrepressible 
		creative spirits of the children themselves&quot;. </font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">But <b>
		Partha Banerjee</b>, a New Jersey-based immigration advocate who 
		interpreted hundreds of hours of tape for Briski from Bengali to English 
		during the filming, was disturbed enough by the end-product to write to 
		the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences last month raising 
		questions about the film, including the unauthorised use of music from 
		Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy. Having grown up in Calcutta, Banerjee is 
		passionate about his city and incensed that the tireless work of other 
		concerned citizens gets not even a fleeting mention. He says it is their 
		work and organising prowess that keeps Sonagachi relatively free of hiv 
		infections compared to other red-light areas in India. </font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Banerjee 
		also says the children's lives are &quot;worse&quot; rather than better, thanks to 
		Briski's intervention. &quot;I visited these children a number of times over 
		the last couple of years and found that almost all the children are now 
		living a worse life than they were before Ms Briski began working with 
		them,&quot; he wrote to the Academy. &quot;The children's despair has exacerbated 
		because they'd hoped that with active involvement in Ms Briski's camera 
		project, there would be an opportunity for them to live a better life.&quot; 
		Their parents believed their children would share some of the glory the 
		filmmakers are now basking in, he said.</font></div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify">&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#0000ff" size="2">Banerjee 
		told Outlook he doesn't begrudge Briski her fame, but he finds her 
		treatment &quot;sensational&quot; as it is unbalanced and ultimately unfair. 
		During the filming, Briski's relations with local activists worsened 
		over many of her decisions. But do Briski and Kauffman have time to look 
		back and analyse this? Not really.</font></p>
