	<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><b>Fake Democracy 
	and the Trade Monster’s True Colors </b></font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Translated from Bengali. Originally 
	published in Akhon Samoy Weekly, July 2003. Now included in Banerjee’s 
	Bengali book published from Dhaka, Bangladesh, 2005. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">With the demise of the Saddam 
	Hussain and Taliban regimes, two staunchly anti-American forces are now 
	gone. It would not be any surprise if the U.S. now attempts to destroy other 
	such powers in Syria, Iran or North Korea. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ever since the days of Hafez al-Assad, 
	Syria has been resolutely anti-American. Then, since the fall of the Shah 
	and the return of the Ayatollah, Iran has become one of the strongest anti-U.S. 
	nations in the Middle East. During the decade-long war between Iran and 
	Iraq, U.S. and some Western countries were instigators behind the bloodshed. 
	At that time, Saddam Hussain was our “good guy” that got generous financial 
	and political endorsement from the Ronald Reagan government. Reagan’s 
	National Security Advisor Colin Powell and his Middle East Envoy Donald 
	Rumsfeld both played important roles in aiding Iraq during the war. 
	Moreover, then-CIA director William Casey used a Chilean firm to send to 
	Iraq cluster bombs to use against Iran's &quot;human wave&quot; attacks. The point is, 
	Powell, Rumsfeld and the U.S. government have long known the war strategies 
	of Saddam Hussain. Mr Rumsfeld, in his drumbeat to bomb Iraq, said that he 
	had &quot;cautioned&quot; the Iraqi leader against using weapons of mass destruction. 
	But there was no mention of such a warning in state department notes of his 
	meeting with Saddam in the eighties. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">U.S. establishment, with help from 
	mainstream media, is now working hard to distort that history, sink the 
	“unlikable” parts into oblivion. But the fact is, in spite of all the 
	campaigns, one cannot really warp history, however hard he tries to do it.
	</font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Let us discuss some other historical 
	facts. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Carlos Mauricio and Martin Almada, 
	two ex-prisoners from El Salvador, recently published their real-life 
	stories in various international newspapers. In 1983, during the civil war 
	in El Salvador, U.S. military consultants infiltrated this tiny Latin 
	American nation. The more they went in, the more the government-sponsored 
	militia of El Salvador became violent and bled the innocent. Mauricio was a 
	professor of biochemistry at El Salvador University. One morning, 
	plainclothes police officers dragged him out of his classroom. He was 
	branded as an enemy of the government and a guerilla commander. It was 
	purely fear mongering, a tactic then Salvador government used to scare off 
	the students and intellectuals. This is one of the many tactics the infamous 
	School of the Americas (SOA) teaches its students, many of whom are known 
	tyrants in Latin America. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Thugs of the militia then handcuffed 
	Mauricio, blindfolded him and beat him mercilessly right in front of his 
	students. For more than ten days, they tortured him in a secret chamber. 
	Mauricio is lucky that he is still alive to tell his story; many of his 
	colleagues, students and compatriots have disappeared from the face of the 
	earth courtesy those SOA graduates. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Mauricio, Alamada and a few of their 
	victim friends have recently brought in a lawsuit against the two Salvadoran 
	military generals who were responsible for their torture and humiliation. 
	These two perpetrators now live in Florida: U.S. government gave these human 
	rights violators a safe haven. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">On the contrary, another such 
	criminal Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia got a different kind of treatment. 
	U.S. in fact actively pursued the trial of Milosevic at the International 
	Court. The reason behind the different treatment is that this man, just like 
	Saddam Hussain, had turned into an &quot;enemy&quot; for his anti-American activities 
	and rhetoric. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">At the same time, many other such 
	despots and dictators all over the world received direct or indirect 
	political and economic support from the U.S. governments via active lobbying 
	of Henry Kissinger, Zbignew Brzezinsky, Donald Rumsfeld, George Bush, Sr. or 
	Dick Cheney. Kissinger and CIA took part in staging a bloody coup against 
	Chile’s popular, democratically elected leader Allende in the seventies. The 
	same was done against Indonesia’s leader Sukarno in the sixties. In these 
	countries, the post-coup years saw extreme violence, killing and 
	anti-people, anti-union activities led by two notorious dictators Pinochet 
	and Suharto. Both these tyrants still escape international law and justice, 
	just like the way Henry Kissinger keeps fleeing justice throughout the 
	world. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Pinochet’s victims included 
	laborers, farmers, intellectuals, students, teachers, artists, singers and 
	activists. One such victim was protest singer Victor Jara – the Bob Dylan of 
	Chile. Jara was tortured, blinded and murdered by Pinochet’s militia. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I didn’t meet Jara. But I met Jafar 
	Hamzah Siddique. We were roommates in Sunnyside, Queens. Jafar was a law 
	student at the New School University and he was from Aceh, a small island 
	off Indonesia. The Indonesian militia under Suharto and then under 
	post-Suharto rulers brutalized East Timor and Aceh. In August, 2000, Jafar 
	decided to travel to Banda Aceh to visit his parents; a few days after he 
	had arrived there, he disappeared. His torturned and mangled body was found 
	on the riverbanks of Medan in September. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I had the opportunity to have a long 
	interview with Jafar in April, just a few months before he was killed. Jafar 
	spoke fondly of his motherland – about the tiny island Aceh. He spoke about 
	its history and its bloody tale of ongoing colonization. Jafar had described 
	how multinational oil corporation Mobil kept occupying and exploiting the 
	land with help from the militia defying the wills and protests of thousands 
	of Acehnese men and women. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Ibrahim, Sulaiman and other Achenese 
	friends had implored Jafar not to go back to Aceh. They warned him that the 
	militia might kill him. Jafar said he must go to pay a last visit to his 
	ailing parents. He never came back. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There was a time when Britain, 
	France, Spain, Holland, Portugal or Belgium invaded and captured Asian and 
	African countries. After plundering the colonized land for centuries, they 
	went back to Europe leaving the country bereft of its riches and with 
	feudalistic people put on as its new leaders. The new “leaders” of the 
	“independent” country kept serving the interests of the colonialists. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">This old version of political 
	colonialism has now given way to a new version, something that we can term a 
	capital colonialism. The U.S. and European governments, with help from the 
	World Bank, International Monetary Fund or World Trade Organizations have 
	imposed severe sanctions against poor and underdeveloped countries and 
	imposed the strictest possible undemocratic, anti-labor economic conditions. 
	In the name of globalization, the rich countries under the stewardship of 
	U.S. are wielding their fierce capital sticks worldwide However, with the 
	unilateral, unprecedented aggression and occupation of Iraq, it seems the 
	primitive, centuries-old brute-force colonization era has returned. </font>
	</p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Are we then going back to those 
	dark, ancient era of monstrous aggression? Often these days, I tend to think 
	that in a way, that is actually good for all of us. The sooner the trade 
	monsters shed off their masks of civilization and democracy and the sooner 
	their true colors come out, the better for us. </font></p>
