						<strong>A Diary from Lebanon: July 14-16, 2006</strong></p>
						<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
						14 July<br>
						<br>
						Am taking advantage of the electricity to write. Will 
						probably lose it again in an hour or so when the bombing 
						starts in full force again. These blackouts are really 
						unpleasant. As is the lack of water. Bathed today with a 
						bottle of drinking water, which was not great and a 
						little extravagant. Am still covered with bits of soap, 
						I am sure.<br>
						<br>
						I only slept about three hours last night, as warplanes 
						started flying low overhead at around 3 a.m. and for 
						three straight hours, there was the constant noise of 
						crashing sonic booms from fighter jets, rapid machine 
						gun fire, and three huge explosions. My nerves are 
						completely shattered. I <br>
						think these coming days are going to get reversed, being 
						up all night listening to shelling and sleeping during 
						the day.<br>
						<br>
						Apparently, last night, they took out the highway that 
						connects Lebanon to Syria, effectively eliminating that 
						as a possible escape route. Our neighborhood is only 
						about a kilometer away, which was why it sounded like it 
						was happening right outside the door. They also bombed a 
						neighborhood in the southern part of Beirut about two 
						kilometers southwest of here after leafleting the area 
						warning all the residents to evacuate.<br>
						<br>
						If it gets any worse, I am going to stay with my friend 
						Elaine at her house in the mountains of Beit Mary, which 
						is a Christian stronghold and safer than being in the 
						city. At the moment, people have ransacked the stores 
						because all food supply lines have been cut off; but 
						managed to stock up on <br>
						a few weeks' worth of supplies despite the complete 
						insanity in all the markets.<br>
						<br>
						Olmert and Peretz promised that Israel would set Lebanon 
						back to where it was twenty years ago, which is a 
						horrifying thought, particularly in light of what twenty 
						years of war have already done to this city. And Bush 
						using this as an excuse to call for intervention in 
						Syria is simply crass and <br>
						equally terrifying.<br>
						<br>
						Everything here is a little surreal; feels like we are 
						operating in a vacuum. We lost power and water for most 
						of the day, but it seems to be back for now, at least. I 
						am fine here. Stocked up on food and emergency candles; 
						registered with the embassy; the old lady next door who 
						lived <br>
						through the last war showed me how to access the bomb 
						shelter under our building. There are even beds down 
						there! I may leave tomorrow or Sunday for the mountains 
						if the shelling gets worse.<br>
						<br>
						The Europeans have all been evacuated by their embassies 
						tonight. They were told that if they did not leave now, 
						their embassies could not take responsibility for them, 
						and they are being bused and airlifted out in military 
						planes. The Canadians and Americans, on the other hand, 
						are being <br>
						told to stay indoors and wait it out, as plans have not 
						yet been finalized for how the embassy will help people 
						leave. Of course their diplomatic personnel and 
						$600-a-day consultants are slated to go first.<br>
						<br>
						Have decided not to try it alone going north to Syria. 
						There are hundreds of cars in line waiting to cross the 
						border, and they look like sitting ducks. The Israelis 
						have already started bombing that road, and there is 
						little chance I would be permitted to enter Syria unless 
						under the auspices <br>
						of the embassy. I actually don't know how I am going to 
						get out of here if I need to, but if the embassy finds a 
						way, I will consider it. We’ll see what the state of 
						affairs is tomorrow.<br>
						<br>
						I am still horrified both at the disproportionate level 
						of retaliation, the complete destruction of the 
						infrastructure, and threats of war from both extreme 
						sides. I was sitting in a cafe in the Christian quarter 
						watching the news when Nasrallah's home was bombed a 
						kilometer away. It was next to <br>
						the refugee legal aid project where I am doing a 
						consultancy at the moment. Thankfully, our meeting was 
						cancelled there this afternoon.<br>
						<br>
						At the moment, remaining in this Christian enclave where 
						I live is the safest thing I can do right now, as it is 
						not a target, and it is too dangerous to travel 
						anywhere. I am more worried about being trapped here for 
						a prolonged period of time, while the international 
						community and <br>
						national political leadership just standing around 
						wringing their hands and asking for it all to stop.<br>
						<br>
						My lawyerly side hoping for Israelis and the Hezballah 
						to conform somewhat to the rules of war and eventually 
						arrange a ceasefire is starting to give way to the 
						suspicion that this will simply spiral for quite some 
						time. Eliminating half of Lebanon would still not defeat 
						the Hezballah, but <br>
						Lebanon is obviously an easy target and pawn in a larger 
						regional game.<br>
						<br>
						I am very concerned about what will happen if the 
						Israelis choose to enter on land, as this could easily 
						spark another civil war. All of the sects are still 
						here, several still heavily armed, and a few who might 
						even ally themselves with foreign intervention against 
						their former enemies. Though <br>
						at present, everyone is remaining quiet and hoping it 
						will end on its own. No one wants a war.<br>
						<br>
						I will keep you posted as things progress. Hopefully 
						will find an exit strategy out of here soon. At the 
						moment, all roads to the borders have been destroyed. 
						And Chris is in the US; my god, the timing of things. 
						Take care.<br>
						<br>
						15 July<br>
						<br>
						New plans today. Just spoke with my friend Adina, who 
						works for a USAID contractor in west Beirut. The 
						shelling in the southern suburbs of Beirut has 
						escalated, and USAID instructed her to leave Hamra 
						immediately. Four of her colleagues are being taken 
						north to a hotel in Batroun, and they agreed to let me 
						stay with them upon Adina's request; so I will go up 
						there either tonight or tomorrow and stay with her.<br>
						<br>
						They are concerned all routes out of the city will be 
						blocked soon; so will try to hurry with packing and 
						such. Word is that evacuation of Americans will start on 
						Monday; hopefully, will be amongst the first in 25,000 
						since will be staying with the govt contractor crowd :)<br>
						<br>
						I suspect we will be evacuated through the Batroun 
						military airport as that is the only one left, but will 
						keep you posted. Have decided to fly to San Francisco to 
						meet Chris for a couple of weeks, and we will drive 
						together down to LA and stay at his house in Venice 
						Beach for the rest of the summer until we decide what to 
						do next. More to follow.<br>
						<br>
						16 July<br>
						<br>
						As you may have suspected, my plans have changed again. 
						The Israelis bombed the only remaining military airport 
						and port in Batroun. My friend Adina is up there and 
						safe, but it is looking unlikely that anyone will now be 
						able to be evacuated from there, and evacuations will 
						somehow have to be conducted from Beirut.<br>
						<br>
						So I have decided to follow my gut instinct and sit 
						tight here in the heart of Beirut’s Armenian 
						Christendom. Most of my neighbors have lived through 
						this sort of thing before; so their choices to remain 
						here are probably wise ones.<br>
						<br>
						And I have just heard from the embassy that the 
						Americans will not be evacuated before Wednesday or 
						Thursday. Plans at this point are leaning towards 
						transport by ship to Cyprus.<br>
						<br>
						The shelling of the southern half of the city last night 
						was relentless and the worst yet. The noise from 
						explosions was deafening, and I decided to sleep at my 
						friend Rana’s place just down the street, in order to 
						have some company and access to BBC.<br>
						<br>
						Am back home this morning, and the Israelis are pounding 
						away in Beirut, no doubt in retaliation for the 
						Hezballah rocket on Haifa. I am afraid these windows in 
						my flat won't be able to take much more; so am keeping 
						them all open in hopes they won't shatter.<br>
						<br>
						At least we have had electricity for a couple of hours 
						now. I am not concerned about the neighborhood being 
						bombed; so much as weaker structures collapsing from the 
						constant reverberations.<br>
						<br>
						I think I am starting to grow accustomed to this 
						horrendous noise. My heart still stops for a second or 
						so every time another bomb is dropped, and then it races 
						to catch up with itself before the next one, but my 
						nerves are a little more steeled to this now.<br>
						<br>
						And am trying to block out images of collapsing 
						buildings and bodies in my mind every time I hear 
						another explosion. They were dropping every 5-10 minutes 
						last night for several hours and will no doubt escalate 
						today.<br>
						<br>
						It is heartbreaking watch the past ten years of hope and 
						reconstruction in his country devolve into fear and 
						resignation. It will be the nation’s psyche and not the 
						infrastructure that will take the longest to rebuild. 
						The atmosphere feels like someone has died.<br>
						<br>
						And am also heartbroken at having to leave this country. 
						Somehow it has made its way under my skin, and I’ve been 
						here now just long enough to start to fall in love with 
						it, only to have to leave.<br>
						<br>
						I keep telling myself it is not for good, but 
						nonetheless, I know I am walking away from many good 
						people who have no choice but to remain here living with 
						the barrage of violence, daily atrocities, and 
						powerlessness over their situation. As usual, it is the 
						civilians on both sides who will <br>
						lose the most.<br>
						<br>
						Well, my dears, I am staying as safe as possible and 
						thinking of all of you. Will stay in touch as events 
						unfold.<br>
