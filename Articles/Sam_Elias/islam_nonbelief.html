	autobiographical essay describing why and how I became a humanist from once 
	a pious Muslim. In her e-mail to me, Ms. Elias also expressed her desire to 
	have a conversation with me on religion and similar issues. We had a long 
	chat and it was not long before I discovered – she has a unique experience 
	and background of being an atheist. Born and brought up in Kuwait to 
	Bangladeshi parents (not a favorable situation to become a freethinker), she 
	had to think and decide for herself the futileness of religion, the 
	scriptures and the hypocrisy of its preachers. It was like going against the 
	tide when no one is ready to listen but only to blame you for everything. 
	Later in her life, Ms. Elias came to US from Kuwait and is now living a 
	happy independent life as a chemical engineer. Her story touched me just 
	like her passionate admirations for <i>Mukto-Mona</i> and its readers. I 
	suggested- she put her story in words and sends it to <i>Mukto-Mona.</i> She 
	has readily agreed on and done so. Over the course of editing her article, 
	we kept in touch with each other for a while and following is the result. I 
	am sure, just like me, the readers are also going to be moved and touched by 
	her tale— funny, sad, shocking; yet powerful enough to say, ”hats off to 
	you, Sam!”</span></p>

	can be rather challenging for children, I think. Children ought to know 
	where the line has been drawn when it comes to curiosity-a natural human 
	trait. In school, children are taught to ask questions in order to clear 
	their minds off the doubts. The more questions we ask the better and the 
	more we learn. (To put it in PB Shelley’s words: <i>The more we learn, the 
	more we discover our ignorance). </i>At home, however, when the same drill 
	is followed on grounds of religion, it is taught to be a taboo. Why aren’t 
	these questions about religion answered and often averted? Once I wondered. 
	And I had to find the answer on my own and it’s been worth its while. 
	Religion was made up by individuals in society to suit themselves best and 
	to control and dominate over the rest. Despite their prevalence in every 
	society, culture, there are no proofs to the outrageous and meaningless 
	claims that the believers point out at. To the contrary, Science provides 
	clear reasons and proofs behind any claims and unlike his/her counterpart, a 
	scientific minded person is always ready to accept/review new ideas so long 
	as it’s based on rationale, logic and the methodology of science. For these 
	reasons, I am more of an ‘Evolution’ believer than ‘Adam and Eve’ myths 
	described in Koran and Bible.</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">Born and 
	raised in Kuwait, as I was growing up, I--like many other Muslim 
	children--was sent to a mosque (also functioned as a <i>Madrassa</i>) where 
	I was expected to learn to read the Holy Quran and to memorize wherever 
	possible. I went there after school hours for about 3-4 hours just like many 
	other kids did. There, however, were kids that spent the whole day at the 
	mosque. They not only read and learnt the Quran but also did all the chores 
	for the Imam, which ranged from washing his clothes to cleaning the whole 
	mosque. It supposedly is considered a ‘sawab’ or a virtuous act. A pupil 
	should serve his or her Imam, we were taught. <i>It is one of the pathways 
	to heaven. </i></span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">At first, 
	I was determined &amp; curious to learn about Islam very sincerely. Initially it 
	felt as if I were going to school to learn math or science. </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">With time, however, I 
	realized- a mosque is nothing like a school. Students were supposed to learn 
	what the Imam asked them to, and they were forbidden from asking any 
	questions. When I asked questions like what the meaning of a particular 
	verse was, I was told <i>‘The teachings of the Almighty ought not to be 
	questioned’</i></span><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">
	</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">or the Imam 
	would give me some mumble jumble answers that made absolutely no sense to me 
	or others and I dared not to ask him to repeat it. The Imam always had a 
	thin bamboo stick with which he would punish children, if they didn’t read 
	accurately or as in my case, asked too many questions. There were children 
	as young as four years old and he had no mercy for anyone. It seemed as 
	though he enjoyed a strange delight when punishing the children. When he hit 
	me for the first time, I came home, aggravated and complained to my parents. 
	I strongly believed, my parents would not let me go back but to my horror, I 
	was wrong. They sent me right back. My mother told me when she was a child, 
	her mosque episode lasted only three days. She discontinued because the Imam 
	hit her for no reason. I made the same plea but I was left with no choice 
	but to return. Since I was not allowed to ask questions at the mosque, but 
	to read mundanely chapter after chapter from the Quran with absolutely no 
	understanding, I indulged in asking questions at home. <i>Who is Allah? 
	Where is Allah? Is Allah a HE, or SHE? Why do we use HE but not SHE or IT to 
	when talk about Allah? Why do we not see Allah? Why is it assumed Allah is 
	in the sky? How was Mohammad (pbuh) selected to be THE MESSENGER and why? 
	How is it possible that the Quran is the words of Allah?</i> My answers were 
	usually responded with ‘It is <i>haram</i> (forbidden) to ask questions like 
	that’ or ‘Don’t ask those questions as you won’t be a Muslim anymore’ or ‘Go 
	pray to Allah and ask for forgiveness’ or most commonly- a slap on the face. 
	There were tons of more questions arising in my mind as I was growing up and 
	watching and learning the Islamic environment but I dared not to ask. </span>
	<b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">Part of me was scared of 
	the hell fire and the harsh punishment in the after life and another part of 
	me could make no sense as to what I was scared for or what my supposed 
	beliefs were, and if they made any sense to me.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">
	</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">I started accepting 
	valid reasons and proofs in science and secretly searched for the same in 
	religion but in vain. I found myself drifting away for Islam. Yet I kept 
	going to the mosque just because I was forced to and it was the ‘right’ 
	thing to do, as I was told. I stopped asking questions both at home and at 
	the mosque. I despised the time of the day during which I spent in the 
	Mosque.<b> </b></span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">I 
	took part in competitions where students were asked to memorize chapters 
	from the Quran and recite in front of the judges. It was merely a memorizing 
	task. Not a single student knew or understood what they were memorizing.</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black"> 
	The assigned parts were memorized, presented and forgotten. I too was a part 
	of it and won almost all of them. As prizes, we were given extracts from the
	<i>hadith </i>that were cheaply framed. There was absolutely no motivation 
	or reason to be a part of that world. Finally, I finished the lessons in 
	Quran and refused to go as there was no reason for me to be a part of a 
	world I wasn’t connecting with. At last I ‘graduated’ from the mosque.
	</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">&nbsp;My 
	parents agreed with me and gave me a break from a few days and hired a 
	‘house Imam’ to teach us (me and my siblings) Islam. I failed in arguing 
	with them that there was absolutely no need for me to go through this all 
	over again. They refused to listen to anything I had to say, and so it 
	started once again. They believed, apart from praying, some connection with 
	Islam ought to be maintained in order for us to mold ourselves into good 
	Muslims. Imam Iqbal (not actual name) came in for about three hours a day 
	everyday, and taught us how to read the Quran (all over again) and other 
	principles of Islam (which included saying a prayer or ‘doa’ in every act of 
	life, even while answering nature’s call). Again, I was strictly ordered to 
	refrain from asking questions of any sort. I was just to listen and learn.
	</span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">Is this a healthy 
	learning process? </span></b></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">&nbsp;Having a 
	‘house Imam’ was a lot easier than going to a mosque. I was able to make 
	numerous trips to the restroom or to my room or get a drink or sometimes 
	even answer the phone while my parents were napping or sometimes even got my 
	homework done so that I could go out later in the evening. I suited the 
	teaching process according to what I wanted. Occasionally, I would get into 
	the conversation with the Imam (mostly one sided). </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">He would tell us stories from 
	the Holy Quran--stories which, according to him, are infused with ‘the 
	greatest moral tales’ in human history, yet I had no idea what all those 
	meant.</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black"> Most were 
	very hard to believe and some sounded absolutely ridiculous. For instance,
	</span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">when Allah said the 
	Arabic word <i>‘Koon’</i>, the world was made, when HE would say (sometime 
	in the near future) ‘Fayakoon’, the world will come to an end. </span></b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">There is more to it: Allah 
	asked ‘Prophet’ Ibrahim to sacrifice his son in a dream and accordingly, 
	Ibrahim was doing so to appease to Allah’s will. Meanwhile, Allah--realizing 
	Ibrahim’s love for his son--spared Ibrahim from sacrificing his own son (Isamel) 
	and instead, asked to sacrifice a camel (or sheep). <b>O</b></span><b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">ne 
	may ask: how come Allah the omniscient couldn’t realize or predict Ibrahim’s 
	devotion to him and had to wait until the latter was about to slaughter off 
	his own son? Is He extraordinary or just a product of the &nbsp;&nbsp;fabricated myth 
	created by humans? </span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">
	I was told, Prophet Mohammed married all the women to save their lives from 
	the then cruel society, including 6 (had sex when she was 9) years old 
	Ayesha when he was about 51 years of age. Some of these ‘stories’ were 
	unbelievable while others I thought were pure crimes. &nbsp;</span></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">Imam 
	Iqbal criticized everything I did starting from the way I dressed, my eating 
	manners (I usually held, and still hold, the spoon with my left 
	hand—supposedly, a Satanic act in Islam), my athletic nature, love for 
	music, books I read, choices on TV programs, friends (Christians and Hindus, 
	boys), freedom, education etc. He always told me he was a ‘pure man’ and 
	that I should learn to be like him. While speaking with a woman, unless 
	absolutely necessary, he refused to look at her (I shouldn’t be interacting 
	with the opposite sex, as he advised). Indeed, he never looked at my mother 
	in the eye while talking to her and spoke to her only when it was 
	unavoidable. He went to the extent of hanging up the telephone if my mother 
	answered when he called. He wouldn’t keep any request my mother made and 
	waited till it came from the man of the house, my father. </span><b>

	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">My ‘house 
	Imam’ taught another set of children just like me and my siblings. They were 
	four sisters, ages ranging from 8 to 16 years. He picked the afternoon (3–5 
	pm) shift to teach them and then came over to our house in the evening. 
	Their parents would return from work at about 4:30 pm, which meant the 
	parents weren’t home for most of the period when the Imam gave lessons. One 
	evening Samira (not actual name)--the oldest of them all--called me and was 
	frantically sobbing. I was trying hard to process the words coming from the 
	other end of the phone. </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">On calming down, she told me 
	the Imam had molested her youngest sister, Salma (not actual name), the 8 
	years old. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to believe her. She unfolded the 
	incident to me. </span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">The 
	abuse had started after about a month of the Imam started his educational 
	visits. The youngest would sit closest to him and was the most vulnerable. 
	Salma was a very quiet girl and usually kept to herself. She was fond of 
	drawing, coloring and fairy tales. Initially the abuse wasn’t too ‘harsh.’ 
	The Imam would touch her feet with his, under the table. Slowly, he started 
	grabbing her feet with his. She complained to her sisters and parents but 
	they ignored her thinking she was trying to get away from taking Quran 
	lessons. This kept going on and the Imam kept moving up her legs. Then he 
	started sliding his hands across her chest ‘innocently’. Salma kept 
	complaining but realized it was of no use. She started believing it was 
	probably just done unknowingly. After a few months, the Imam started talking 
	dirty to her when she was alone. He would ask the other three sisters to 
	either get him some tea, or sit in the other room and read the assigned 
	chapters in solitary, or would make the pretext Salma needed more 
	concentration. He would then touch her un-developed bosoms, and between her 
	legs, pretending to explain the taboos of Islam and occasionally make her 
	touch his penis. Salma was very disturbed and frightened. </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">He also told her she ought 
	not to speak a word of this to anyone and if she did, it would only result 
	in harsh punishment in hell and death of her parents, stressing much more on 
	the latter. He said he taught these things to her as he thought she was a 
	special one and that Allah had instructed him to give her ‘special’ lessons. 
	Such was the nature of ‘special’ lessons! </span></b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">While this continued, one 
	afternoon when Samira’s mother was napping in the other room, Samira came in 
	to offer some tea to our Imam--only to watch a horrific sight. She saw he 
	made her little sister touch his bare penis. Salma had tears running down 
	her cheeks. The Imam, frightened, got his act together, ran out the door and 
	never returned. Samira, having been ignored about her earlier complaints of 
	the Imam, yelled at her mother. This time, however, her parents were 
	terrified too. Her mother asked Salma how long this was going on for, and 
	her response was ‘a long time’. Her parents now believed her. This young 
	girl was sexually abused right in her house, almost in front of her sisters, 
	with their mother in an adjacent room; by a man her parents trusted the 
	most. </span></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">&nbsp;Samira 
	called to warn me of the Imam. I listened to it all and wasn’t sure at the 
	time what was the right thing to do. Shocked and in disbelief, I reiterated 
	the whole incident to my mother. She refused to believe it, or just 
	pretended not to, and said bluntly ‘That’s not possible. Do you think the 
	Imam is crazy?’ No matter how hard I tried to tell her this was true, she 
	said I had no choice but to continue my lessons. His next round was our 
	house. I warned my sister. She believed me for obvious reasons. So we 
	continued to take lessons from him. My mother strictly asked my father to be 
	present while we were taking lessons. To this day, I still try to understand 
	why my mother refused to believe me yet she asked my father to be present 
	every single day from that day onwards during our lessons. I still question, 
	why my parents didn’t discontinue the lessons. &nbsp;</span></font></p>

	lost all respect for this ‘man of God’ and behaved as harshly as possible in 
	the absence of authority. I believed this was the zenith of it all. How can 
	a ‘man of God’ commit a crime so harsh and get away with it? How can a 
	criminal preach the importance and the divinity of a religion? Why would any 
	adult abuse something as pure as a child? Is this religious justice? Is this 
	what the Imam learnt when he was a child? Was he abused too? &nbsp;</span></font></p>

	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">Imam 
	Iqbal was very much aware that he was committing a grave crime as sexually 
	abusing an innocent child in front of so called Holy Quran before which he 
	had performed <i>waduh </i>(sanctifying ritual before a prayer). Where is 
	the fear of Allah in this act? Reading this story, many bigoted Muslims and 
	those sympathetic to them would probably ask, <i>how could you base your 
	judgment of Islam on a single isolated (?) incident (‘house imam’ story in 
	my case)? Or, why blame Islam for the fault of its follower?</i> In that 
	case, I have got something to say here: What use, if any, is a religion, if 
	it cannot stop its own ‘sacred preachers’ from deliberately committing sin? 
	Why Islam, <i>the truest and the greatest religio</i>n—as its followers 
	claim—fail so badly to stop its followers from committing such a heinous 
	crime as sexual abuse of a child? </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">Where does <i>the greatness</i> 
	of a religion lie--just in myths? &nbsp;Or is it because – to cure evil in human 
	nature we’ve mistakenly adhered to religion—an artificial remedy?</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">
	</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">So ironic is the fact 
	despite prevalence of so many odd, abusive and mediocre traits among their 
	preachers, common people continue to believe that a person cannot be honest, 
	decent without subscribing to some form of religious belief. Indeed, from 
	what I have seen-an atheist’s sense of morality is much stronger and deeply 
	rooted than that in most of the ‘preachers of God.’ Let me share another 
	true but small episode: &nbsp;</span></font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 36.0pt">
	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">A 
	‘gentleman’ I know walked out of a mosque after the <i>Maghrib</i> prayer 
	and snapped the tires of another gentleman’s car with a pen knife. As I was 
	passing by and noticed the action, I went up to him and questioned him to 
	which he replied, <i>‘Ami sure shalar beta amar gaarir tire puncture koreche. 
	Dekhi aj kemne amar garir shamne park kore!’ (“I’m sure that the guy 
	punctured the tire of my car. Let me see, how he parks his car today in 
	front of mine.”).</i> Remember, we’re talking of a man who had just walked 
	out of a mosque after the prayer. They were neighbors in continuous dispute.

	<font face="Verdana"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black">There are 
	plenty of rumors about Imams and preachers of other religions, mostly 
	relating them to sexual abuse, child abuse and misbehaving with women. I 
	refused to believe them initially. Now however, I believe these rumors are 
	out and about due to some reasons. Something must have happened somewhere 
	that brought up these rumors. I have spoken to women in ‘Imam Families’ that 
	speak ill of the men in the family. I passionately dislike Imams no matter 
	how good they are. I dislike any individual who tries to preach Islam or any 
	religion to me or anyone. </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">As said already, I didn’t 
	make my decision based on just Imam Iqbal. I chose to write about him 
	because he is supposedly a ‘pure man’ of religion but for sure, we have 
	abundant no. of such Imams in all religions. Let’s take priest as an 
	example.</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black"> Priests 
	are continuously being reported for sexual abuse of young boys and nuns. 
	These ‘men of God’ ought to be in abstinence all their lives, they ought to 
	give themselves up for God, but are they doing so? Recently it has been 
	religiously legal for priests to get married. </span><b>
	<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: maroon">The conclusion here is these
