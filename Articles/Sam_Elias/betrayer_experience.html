	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">I was asked to write a short story. The theme 
	was to be of love. How is one expected to write of love when there is none 
	in this fast mechanical world of today? No matter where I look to seek love, 
	I fail to spot it. Then, how am I to put it in words? Good memories are the 
	only element that could be put in words by me.<br>
	<br>
	The taskbar showed a blinking messenger window. It was a new message from an 
	unfamiliar email address. I clicked on it and tried to recognize the person 
	via the email address. I didn’t recognize still. The message said “Hey Sam. 
	Guess who?” Obviously the person on the other end was aware of the fact that 
	I would fail to recognize him or her and that I do not have them added on my 
	messenger list. I wasn’t sure if I should answer the message. I usually tend 
	to avoid such botherations.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Since I was home alone and had absolutely 
	nothing to do, I replied “I don’t like guessing games and I really have no 
	idea who you are.” <br>
	<br>
	He replied back, “This is Ahsan, from Dhaka, remember?” I thought he was 
	really excited when he typed that. There were smiley faces added to the 
	text. I wondered how he would sound.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Ahsan. The name lingered in my brain for a few 
	minutes. I was trying to remember Ahsan. Could it really be him after so 
	long? Numerous thoughts went gushing through my memory lane as though it 
	were flooding my mind.<br>
	<br>
	I met Ahsan during my visit to Bangladesh, a few years ago. Since I have 
	never lived in Bangladesh, genuine friends of mine do not exist. Ahsan was a 
	friend of my cousins. My cousin invited me to visit her university and hang 
	out with her friends. Ahsan was one of the friends. The window started 
	blinking again. “Do you remember me Sam?” </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">When we were introduced, Ahsan looked directly 
	into my eyes. The others did too but there was something about his eyes I 
	couldn’t resist, I couldn’t look away. Generally I look at the movement of 
	the lips when talking to a person. But in his case, it was as though he had 
	gripped my vision with his. It was as though I was falling off a cliff and 
	he was retrieving me, the connection between us being merely the grip of his 
	hand on to mine. Yet I was very comfortable. He stared into my eyes and 
	introduced himself. He said to me “My name is Ahsan and I am majoring in 
	Computer Science with a minor in math. I work part time as a programmer.” 
	Those words felt as though there was a deeper hidden meaning. He meant 
	something else. He wanted me to know more than just his name, major and 
	occupation. He wanted me to know him. He wanted to know me. His hand was 
	wrapped firmly around mine and surprisingly I enjoyed it. There was warmth 
	in his hand. A kind of warmth I had never felt before in any hand shake.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">“Ki bepar, kotha bolcho na keno? Mone porche 
	na ki? Are ami Armin er bondhu. Ei baar mone porbe to?” (“Whats the matter, 
	what are you not replying? You can’t remember is it? I am Armin’s friend. 
	Does that ring a bell? Now, do you remember me?”)</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">“Oh yes Ahsan, I remember you. I remember you 
	well. How are you? It has been a while since I spoke to you. Kemon acho?” 
	(“How are you?”) </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">All of us had ordered a drink. I ordered 
	coffee and so did Ahsan. He bought my coffee and took the spot next to me. I 
	wanted him to and I was glad he did. He read my mind I thought. It felt good 
	to think so. We spoke about his life, my life, and our lives. He admitted he 
	liked me the first time he saw me and he wanted to see more of me. He said 
	he had heard of me from my cousin but didn’t think he would be this 
	impressed when he met me in person. Apparently, my cousin never mentioned 
	him.<br>
	<br>
	We were among a noisy crowd but that didn’t bother us one bit. We were in a 
	world of our own. Surprising, how he engulfed me in this world he created, 
	that I was so engrossed in, I forgot where I was or that even the others 
	existed in that given time. It was as if some sort of equilibrium had been 
	established between the world we were in and the actual world around us. 
	Both worlds were parallel yet ours was invisible. We ‘connected’ so well. We 
	were so different in nature yet so similar. We were from different 
	dimensions but it seemed as though we reached for the same unique element, 
	love. He stared right into my eyes and I had no control over myself. I felt 
	as though I was wandering somewhere in his world and was unable to find my 
	way back. I enjoyed the feeling of discovering this new stranger in this 
	very unique way. There was something about his brown eyes and the way he 
	looked at me. I like to believe he never stared at anybody like the way he 
	stared at me. I felt something that was unexplainably wonderful and have 
	never felt as such since.<br>
	<br>
	We exchanged phone numbers. Ahsan called me every minute he was free. We 
	spent every night of the two weeks that I knew him on the phone. (I met him 
	two weeks before I was scheduled to leave for the United States). Sleep was 
	not of the essence. I was happy. I was very happy and after a long time. I 
	desired to meet him more often.<br>
	<br>
	My grandmother was admitted in a clinic for checkup. I was asked to stay 
	with her during most of the day and overnight. The following day, before 
	this decision was made, Ahsan and I were to go out for dinner. I informed 
	him the dinner was to be cancelled as I had a far more important 
	responsibility that couldn’t be avoided under any circumstance. He was upset 
	but said he would find a way to have dinner with me. I didn’t take it 
	serious and scheduled another day.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">During the course of the day, we spoke over 
	the phone. When my dad, uncle and aunts left the clinic and I was about to 
	retire for the night, I called Ahsan to wish him a good night. He said “Sam 
	come outside the clinic. I am waiting for you with dinner.” I couldn't 
	believe what he said. Rushing outside the cabin and the double doors in my 
	pajamas, I saw him with dinner set on a broken plastic table, barely stood 
	right, that he borrowed from the vendor nearby. He also arranged a street 
	side vendor to be our waiter. I stood at the entrance of the clinic staring 
	at this crazy guy. Various thoughts were engrossing my mind about the two of 
	us. I totally forgot about my ill grandmother. It was selfish but the 
	feeling of guilt failed to appear. He stared back at me and smiled. He 
	waited for me to have dinner with him. I slowly approached him, still in 
	awe, he hugged me. He said, “Let's have dinner Jaan. I am hungry.” I had no 
	words in my mouth. ‘Jaan' rang in my ears. No one called be ‘Jaan' before 
	Ahsan. I was flabbergasted. I think silence was the best language then. We 
	had Chinese food.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;After dinner, we had to return the table. We 
	sat at the stairs nearby. He sat in front of me and once again stared at me. 
	It was dark around us. There was a little trace of neon light from the 
	corner vendors. It was almost quiet. Ahsan’s eyes were lit up. I could see 
	his eyes twinkling. He was very happy. I was very happy. He held my hands 
	and kept on staring. I was falling down some alley of happiness and I wasn’t 
	scared. I knew there was someone there to hold me. He slowly approached me 
	and gently kissed me on my lips. He was an awful kisser. He said “You are my 
	first kiss, Sam” and that was very obvious, I thought. He left. I retired 
	for the night, but sleep took off from me long ago.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">A day or two later, we met again. He took me 
	out for coffee. This time I dressed up like a true Bengali girl. I could 
	tell he was surprised that I could clean up so well. We started getting far 
	more than closer to each other. He became a very good friend. We shared 
	everything. We never kissed again however. He asked me a few times to stay 
	back in Bangladesh. He said he would take me somewhere far away from the 
	city hustle bustle. He said he would make me very happy. He confessed he was 
	falling in love with me. Terrified when he indirectly proposed to me, I 
	didn’t answer. I just blankly started at him and wondered. Did he mean all 
	of this? Was he really falling in love with me? No matter the truth or not, 
	at the time I wanted to believe it and I did. I felt so special.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">We went to parks, shopping malls and rode on 
	rickshaws on rainy days. When he hugged me, I felt as though I was lost 
	amidst his broad chest. I felt a strange sense of comfort and security. That 
	was very unusual of me. I am and was an independent girl. I was strong and 
	could fight anything but Ahsan. As days went by, I drew closer to him.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, it was time for me to leave. The 
	night before my flight, we spent all night on the phone. He was so sad that 
	I had to leave. He said fate should not have let us meet like this for two 
	weeks. We should have either met to be together forever or should not have 
	met at all. He also said he had a wonderful time with me and that I have a 
	special place in his heart. I believed everything this man said to me. I was 
	happy I met a man that felt this way about me. It renewed all the trust I 
	had lost towards men. </font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">I snapped out of my thoughts and asked him how 
	he was doing and what had he been doing. I tried to make up for the lost 
	time. He said he was well. He was involved in a relationship for a while but 
	was very unhappy. He confessed he looked for a Sam in the girl he dated or 
	every girl he meets. He thought he would get over me but in vain. He asked 
	me how I was doing and if I was married yet. I answered his questions and 
	told him I wasn’t going to visit Bangladesh any time soon. He said he ached 
	for me from time to time. He wanted to call me and speak with me.<br>
	<br>
	There is no harm in talking to an old friend is there? But I refused to give 
	him my phone number. I didn’t know why. I desired to talk to him too, I 
	desired to listen to his ever so addictive voice, and I urged to hear all 
	those wonderful things he has to say about me. He had been lost somewhere in 
	my thoughts. This message of his refreshed every little urges and desires in 
	me with a whole new meaning. Astonishing it was to realize how I had 
	forgotten about this man that gave me some of the most wonderful time of my 
	life. How could I have been so selfish?<br>
	<br>
	“Why did you not reply to my emails? Why did you spend all the time with me 
	if it meant nothing to you? Why did you choose to remain distant? Why did 
	you not call me at least once after you reached the USA? Why did you take me 
	for granted? Was I merely a toy to you? Do you know how insanely I have been 
	trying to reach you? I still am in love with you Sam. What am I supposed to 
	do? How am I supposed to get over you? Give me something here. Say 
	something. I know you have your own established life, but what is the harm 
	in talking to me. I don’t expect anything from you, never did, but I always 
	thought we would be friends. You agreed to it too, didn’t you? Then why did 
	you not keep your promise? Why did you shut me off? Why did you try to 
	forget me? How can you forget me? Is it fair to you or to me? I think of you 
	every night. I picture you everyday. When I pass through the places we spent 
	time together, I ache to see you again. I long to touch you, feel you and 
	hug you again. Do you not feel anything?”</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">Ahsan shot out all these questions at me. I 
	could only imagine his despair voice. I could feel his pain. I hated myself 
	for what I did. But I knew if I kept touch with him, he would expect love in 
	return. I was not ready for a relationship with him. I never wanted one. How 
	could I start something that I couldn’t maintain? I never once promised him 
	my life. He failed to realize that. I had no answers to his questions. I 
	thought I had done us both a favor. I believed it would be easy to let go of 
	someone he just met and disappeared. It was mere infatuation. People get 
	over infatuations. I tried to make it as though I never existed in his life 
	and vice versa. Now, I realized I did it all for myself. I ran away from 
	Ahsan for myself. I wanted to get away from him to make life easier for me. 
	I took what I wanted and disappeared.<br>
	<br>
	I sat still on my chair and stared at the bare screen with the messenger 
	window and numerous unexpected questions. I didn’t realize how much pain I 
	had caused this individual in a mere so called friendly meeting. I 
	acknowledged every word he said to me all over again and realized it was 
	only the truth he was speaking. Ahsan meant every word he said to me. I 
	failed to trust him. The trust I claimed to gain towards men was not for 
	him, it was for my future relationships and the men I would meet in my 
	future life.</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
	<font face="Verdana" size="2">I closed the window and signed out of 
	messenger. Realizing I never felt the way Ahsan felt when he was with me, I 
	sighed. I wanted to cry out loud but in vain. He was never a part of my 
	life. He was like a memorable spring, or fall that was pleasant and went by 
	through my life, never to come back. Or so I thought.<br>
	<br>
	When I started writing, I thought I would be writing of a story or rather a 
	memory of love. I was wrong. This is not a story of love. This is a story of 
	betrayal of faith. This is a story of a betrayer’s experience.<br>
