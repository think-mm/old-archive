				<div id="yiv1921126695">
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					A little less than a year after our breakup, I learn he has 
					decided to get married and start his so called normal life (<i>definition 
					of normal life according to him: a married life with a good 
					house wife who will cook, clean and make babies essentially</i>). 
					I was disturbed at that once again but do not allow it to 
					bother me for too long. He does this merely to prove he has 
					left his past behind and wants nothing to do with me in his 
					present or future (We were in touch and sometimes had 
					arguments over our breakup essentially blaming each other 
					for the situations that arose that day).&nbsp;Still angry about 
					the events of that winter night in the month of February of 
					the previous year and the following months that came, he 
					chose not to inform me of this decision in his life himself 
					(in spite of my request) instead asks an acquaintance to 
					send me an informal invitation merely to indicate that I 
					make no contact with him whatsoever, or at least that is how 
					I interpret it.&nbsp;As a well wisher, the most I could do was 
					congratulate him via email. I could have sent him a card but 
					I chose not to for unknown reasons. That was the last of him 
					in my life. I decide to accept the fact that he has moved on 
					and now it was time for me to. I have since tried to keep 
					him in good memories and erase the bad and am still trying. 
					I still love him. I still desire to listen to his voice. I 
					still wonder how he is doing and wonder what could have 
					happened if we did share our lives. My eyes still search him 
					in crowds hoping to find him. Sometimes, I also imagine 
					various possibilities or the results of his rage, hostility 
					and the actions that will follow perhaps. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">Deep in 
					thoughts…</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
					few years will have passed by from now, the present. I will 
					not have settled as yet, the reason I am not aware of or 
					just prefer to run away from perhaps. At that point, I don’t 
					believe I love him as much as I used to a few years back or 
					even as much I thought I would then. He will completely be 
					aware of me and my life without my knowledge of it. </font>
					</p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
					one day, my phone will flash an ‘unknown number’. I will 
					answer it just like I would any other ‘unknown number’ calls 
					to my phone. I will answer “This is Sam.” There will be 
					silence on the other end. “Hello?” A faint male voice will 
					then reply “Sam!!??” I will try to recognize the voice but 
					in vain. Politely, I will ask “Yes, this is Sam and you 
					are?” Silence will dawn again for a few seconds… &nbsp;<br>
					“It’s me, *****” He will have taken me by shock. “Pardon 
					me”, I will answer confused. He will repeat “It’s me, *****”
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
					I will not recognize his voice or even be unable to recall 
					what his voice sounded like years back. I guess our brain 
					cells tend to store people’s voices just like music in 
					various notes and pitches. Voices we listen to everyday, we 
					recognize just like the familiar music to our ears and the 
					rest is stored somewhere in the back of our mind locked away 
					in some closet of the mind where it has layers of dust 
					depending on the time it has been kept there to be 
					forgotten, eventually erased. When a long lost voice or 
					music is heard again, the brain cells tend to look in the 
					back of the mind to help us recognize it. My brain cells 
					refused to even do that. I absolutely failed to remember his 
					voice. I only recognized his name.&nbsp;<br>
					“Is this a bad time? Should I call back later?” &nbsp;<br>
					I will reply “No, no, you just surprised me. I didn’t think 
					you would ever call me or that I would ever talk to you 
					again. Just trying to digest” He will say with calm “I think 
					I knew I would call you someday”</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
					will try my best not to show my astonishment and try and 
					keep a casual air about my voice. Our conversation will 
					commence… I volunteer to take charge…&nbsp;<br>
					“So how have you been? You are a married man now! Oops! 
					Congratulations on your wedding. Where’s my invitation?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Would you have come? If I invited you?”&nbsp;<br>
					“I’m not sure but you could have sent me an invitation and 
					maybe then I would have a chance to consider it. After all, 
					it was your wedding.”&nbsp;<br>
					“Are you being sarcastic?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Absolutely not, why should I be sarcastic? Don’t you think 
					both of us should have grown out of it now?” This will 
					follow by moments of silence or awkwardness perhaps. During 
					these moments I will wonder what he will be thinking right 
					at that moment or what I is to be said following the 
					silence. There were so many moments we spent in silence over 
					the phone in the past. They were very pleasant. It was as 
					though we communicated well through silence in certain 
					circumstances. But this silence will be different and very 
					uncomfortable. We both will want to end it. &nbsp;<br>
					“How does it feel to be married?” I will break the silence. 
					&nbsp;<br>
					“Why don’t you get married? Get married and you will know.”&nbsp;<br>
					“You know me, my life is so uncertain. I remember, you 
					always said that. Indeed, it has been so. I do what I please 
					when I please. I am not bound by any element of this world. 
					(Now I will be a little sarcastic) I enjoy freedom to its 
					zenith. I guess I got lost somewhere with the joy of being 
					free and didn’t find the time to get married as yet. But I 
					am still young enough to get married. So it’s still not too 
					late. I will definitely consider it. Anyways, let’s forget 
					about me and talk about you. When do I get to meet Mrs. 
					*****? Jante eiche kore she amar cheye shundor kina, amar 
					cheye bhalo kina, tomar kotha shune kina, tomar mom er 
					pochondo ta kemon, tomar khayyal rakhe kina, tumi jemon bou 
					chaite, thik temon kina.”&nbsp;<br>
					He will say “Khota diccho?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Bah! Khota dibo keno? I would really love to meet her. 
					Honestly! Tumi to amar purono kaaler bondhu, 
					misunderstanding hoyechilo, du jon rege chilam, ei ekhon eto 
					bochor por tomar raag komlo, catch up korte hobe na bolo? 
					Tomar bou ke amar bari anbe, unake to bolar dorkar nei 
					amader history chilo. Amader kotha shudhu amader e thakbe. 
					Ami tai chai. Bolo ei baar kobe ascho bou ke niye?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Sam” he will say, following a long pause, “I want to see 
					you.” His voice will be firm and emotionless. “If possible 
					now or as soon as tomorrow” The background noises were that 
					of an airport. Perturbed, I will say “Z, where are you?”&nbsp;<br>
					“New Jersey”&nbsp;<br>
					“Where, in New Jersey?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Close to your house”&nbsp;<br>
					“How do you know where my house is?”&nbsp;<br>
					“I know everything about you.” I will be supposed to be 
					happy at this answer but I will not as his voice will 
					indicate something is gravely wrong.&nbsp;<br>
					“Do you want to come over and we can order in? I haven’t had 
					dinner yet. Have you?”&nbsp;<br>
					He will laugh lightly “Haha” and say “You still don’t 
					cook?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Never needed to. So coming over then?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Sure”&nbsp;<br>
					“Dinner?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Sure”&nbsp;<br>
					“Address? Directions?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Have it!! GPS!!!”&nbsp;<br>
					“Right” I will smile and hang up disturbed. I will stare at 
					the cell phone screen till the back light turns off 
					distracting my line of thoughts (essentially a confusion if 
					what just happened was real or not) for the few seconds 
					after the call.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, after a while (I don’t know exactly how long) 
					there will be a knock on my door.&nbsp;I will still be wondering 
					if he really is going to be standing in front of me when I 
					open the door.&nbsp;Pulling myself up together, I will walk 
					towards my front door, frightened.&nbsp;There will be numerous 
					thoughts in my mind. These thoughts will have no order in 
					which they will flood my brain. All random thoughts such as 
					I should have cleaned last weekend, or I didn’t notice the 
					layer of dust that can gather within a period of time if not 
					dusted, or is my house presentable and tidy enough, or do I 
					look presentable, or have I lost or gained weight over the 
					years, or how does he look now, or is he really at the front 
					door, or why is he at the front door if he is, or is he 
					really married, or what am I going to tell mom, or should I 
					even tell mom he is here to see me after all these years and 
					after what he has done to me, or it hasn’t been that long 
					either has it, or was it right for me to ask him to come 
					over, or other distorted thoughts that will make no sense to 
					me at all. Some inexplicable form of fear and discomfort 
					will capture me that I will try my best to fight but will 
					fail in the span of time from wherever I will be till I 
					reach for the door knob. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
					will finally reach my front door and take a deep breath. I 
					will turn the knob very slowly still trying to believe who 
					will actually be standing on the other side of the door. I 
					could just look into the eye hole to confirm it will be him 
					but for some reason that thought will not occur to me.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
					will open the door, nervous. My heart will be beating very 
					fast. And then I will see him. He will be standing right in 
					front of me. He will look like he looked 3 years ago. There 
					will have been very little changes. His age will be more 
					visible. He will look more mature and more like a married 
					man or so I will think. He might just get a little darker 
					over the years, maybe put on some weight or not. He still 
					will be handsome. His height and broad shoulders will be 
					intact. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
					will force a smile as soon as he sees me, a guilt filled 
					faint smile. We will stand just like that for a few minutes, 
					trying to catch up on the physical changes that will have 
					been bought upon us due to age and time. I will snap out of 
					the shock and say “Please come in.” Leading the way to my 
					living room, I will mumble “I can’t still believe you are 
					here with no notice. It’s a surprise.”&nbsp;<br>
					“Good or bad surprise?”&nbsp;<br>
					“I am not sure.”&nbsp;<br>
					“You look great.”&nbsp;<br>
					“You look tired.”&nbsp;<br>
					“I am tired.”</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">He will 
					be casually dressed, jeans and polo. He will take a seat on 
					the couch and face me. I will sit opposite to him. &nbsp;<br>
					“Can I make myself comfortable?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Please do.”&nbsp;<br>
					He will get up and take the seat next to me. I will watch 
					him as he makes the shift, again trying to follow up on the 
					physical changes. We will be facing each other now with very 
					little air between us as compared to his initial position. 
					He will hold my hand, gently kiss the back and ask me “How 
					are you Sam?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Well.” I will answer confused. He will seem very perturbed 
					in his own mind and it will be visible in his expression. 
					Looking at him with concern I will ask “Are you ok?”&nbsp;<br>
					He will let out a long sigh and say “Let’s see. I will tell 
					you what I am going through, what is on my mind and where I 
					stand in life. If I am able to explain well, you can then 
					decide if I am ok or not.”</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disturbed, confused and a little freaked out, I will 
					blankly stare at him. Again, there will be a moment of 
					silence during which we will look at each other into the 
					eyes without hesitation. Our eyes will be talking in their 
					own language. He will take a deep breath and intrude the 
					silence. He will shift his focus on my hand and continue “I 
					returned home from work early this afternoon only to find my 
					wife in bed with another man who apparently happened to be 
					the husband of our ‘hang-out-couple’ (he will finger quote 
					the phrase) and a close friend. I don’t know if his wife is 
					aware of this arrangement of theirs but chances are she 
					isn’t. I stood there for a few minutes totally lost in space 
					not knowing what I am expected to do. I walked out of my 
					apartment, sat in my car and screamed as loudly as I could. 
					I drove to the airport and took a flight to Newark, New 
					Jersey. As soon as I landed, I called you and here I am. So, 
					what do you suppose Sam, am I okay?”</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 
					much as he will fight the urge to cry, tears will roll down 
					his cheeks. He will not be able to look me in the eye even 
					though he will try a few times. He will let go of my hand 
					gently and fall back on the couch to be more comfortable. 
					Staring at the ceiling he will sigh again, he will be lost 
					in his thoughts for moments. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
					will not know how to react or even say at that point. I will 
					be sorry for him, really sorry for him but somewhere deep in 
					my heart I will know he is hurt because he hurt me someday; 
					he hurt the person that loved him most. I will be very 
					tempted to hug him and tell him everything will be just 
					fine. I will be there for him always and forever, no matter 
					what, just like I used to. Instead, I will hold myself back.
					</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
					continued to stare into the air and then said “Please hug me 
					Sam.” Tears will flood my eyes. This time I will not be able 
					to stop myself. I will put my arm around him and pull him 
					towards me. Kissing him on his forehead, I will hug him 
					tight. I will have hugged him after 3 years. I will realize 
					how much I missed him over the lost period of time. An 
					awkward gap will be fulfilled as soon as I hug him. A 
					feeling of completeness will dawn upon me. He will cry like 
					a baby on my bosom and I will protect him from any harm like 
					I always did. He will be my baby once again.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I 
					am sorry Sam. I really am sorry for my actions. I shouldn’t 
					have hurt you. It was wrong on my part. I shouldn’t have let 
					you go. I shouldn’t have been mad at you for so long. I 
					shouldn’t have acted out in rage. I have loved you every 
					moment to this day. I thought getting married would help me 
					forget you but I was wrong and I was living a pretentious 
					life of being happily married. I didn’t let my wife ever 
					understand my love was all for you. I made up for every 
					drawback towards her and even then she did this to me. She 
					lied to me and cheated on me. No one has loved me like you 
					have. It is true. Forgive me Sam.”</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
					will hold him hard, close to my heart and will listen to 
					every word he will say. My response to it all will be 
					silence. He will continue to rest his head on my bosom and 
					keep his eyes closed. He will find peace. I will find peace. 
					We will enjoy the peace together. We will communicate in 
					silence, through our breathing and my heart beat. I will 
					have mixed emotions. I am supposed to be happy but somewhere 
					subconsciously I will be aggravated to a certain degree by 
					his presence. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another knock on my door will break the long silence. 
					“That’s the Chinese food I ordered in.”</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
					will set the food on the table and invite him to have 
					dinner. In the midst of setting the table, he will have 
					washed his face and freshen himself. He will force a smile 
					on his face. Walking towards me and the dinner table he will 
					say “Wow, dinner with Sam… after a long time” The latter 
					part came after a pause and a blank stare. I will apologize 
					for not being able to have a more decent menu. He will pull 
					back the chair for me and wait till I am seated. He will sit 
					in front of me. &nbsp;<br>
					“Why haven’t you started your life and settled as yet?”&nbsp;<br>
					I will smile at him, playing with my fork and food and reply 
					“Why do you think I haven’t started my life or haven’t 
					settled?”&nbsp;<br>
					“You are the same Sam I left three years ago. Still answer a 
					question with a question.”&nbsp;<br>
					“What is the degree of change that can occur in an 
					individual in just three years?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Look at me! I have changed a lot in ‘just’ three years.” He 
					will stress the word, just. &nbsp;<br>
					“Have you really changed or is it that you think you have 
					changed? Moreover, the person that I knew a few years back 
					didn’t ever like the idea of changing himself and didn’t 
					ever believe he will ever change. Then how is it that he 
					himself is admitting he has changed and that too in just 
					three years?”</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">He will 
					play with his fork fumbling the chicken in the General Tso’s 
					Chicken dish, trying to soak it in the sweet and spicy 
					sauce. “You still didn’t answer my question!”&nbsp;<br>
					“Which one?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Why haven’t you started your life? Why haven’t you 
					settled?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Define life”&nbsp;<br>
					He will give me the cut–the–crap–and–answer– me look. “I 
					think in my understanding, I am well into my life.”&nbsp;<br>
					“Why haven’t you got married?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Ah! Marriage! I will perhaps, when the right time arrives. 
					Do you think I am too old to get married? You got married at 
					32. I am still not 30.”&nbsp;<br>
					“When will you get married?”&nbsp;<br>
					“I haven’t or don’t quite plan on it formally. It will 
					happen sometime in the future. Fate has it in store for me 
					somewhere, I am sure of that.”&nbsp;<br>
					“Are you seeing anyone or involved romantically?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Is that absolutely important as of right now?”&nbsp;<br>
					“Somewhat!”&nbsp;<br>
					“How so?” </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">We will 
					not look at each other during this conversation. We will 
					both be tossing our chicken pieces in the sauce even though 
					it will be overly saturated with all that the sauce has to 
					provide relative to taste. &nbsp;<br>
					“If you don’t have anyone in your life, I would like to make 
					a proposition. It will be very selfish of me to even propose 
					it but I believe I have learnt from my mistakes and am ready 
					to be a better individual with you.” &nbsp;<br>
					“Proposition?” I will look towards him. My hands will still 
					be carelessly engrossed in its activity with the fork. I 
					will have now included the broccoli in my game of 
					wetting–in–the–sauce–up–to–saturation–or–more. He will be 
					looking straight into my eyes. I will be a little 
					uncomfortable but I will fight it and look right back into 
					his, sometimes stealing a sight at his lips. &nbsp;<br>
					“I would like to marry you…” His voice will be firm. He will 
					mean every word he will say. I will astonishingly stare at 
					him in awe. My jaw will drop and will remain hanging for 
					moments together. My head will be blank. I will continue 
					staring at him when he will break the silence while my 
					astonishment will still prevail. “Sorry. I am being awfully 
					selfish. Tomake biyer kotha bola uchit hoini, again. I don’t 
					know what to do. My life has been such a mess. I tried so 
					hard to shape it the way I wanted it to be but I failed to 
					realize that the most important part of my life was missing. 
					You were missing. I ran away from what my heart said and 
					wished for. I have failed horribly in love and life. Now, 
					today I realize what u meant when you said you hadn’t 
					cheated on me that night. It was only an innocent night out 
					with your friends. It was an unavoidable situation you 
					wanted to get over with. You were right about me being 
					scared about everything. I was scared, very scared I would 
					lose you to someone or something and that I would be hurt 
					very badly. I feared your trip to India would be the end of 
					us. I feared I would lose to your ambitions and career. I 
					feared you would choose your career over me and I would be 
					left alone. I feared your independent nature. I refused to 
					believe marriage would be enough to keep you from leaving me 
					and following your dreams and ambitions. Subconsciously, I 
					wished for you to throw away your life and solely be 
					dedicated to mine. I did what I did so that I didn’t get 
					injured. I didn’t think of you even once.&nbsp;I used that night 
					as a spark and kept fueling the fire as much as I could. I 
					could have controlled it but I refused to in fear of pain. I 
					was afraid of things I didn’t know of and couldn’t and still 
					can’t explain. I failed to realize the damage would be 
					massively large on me and in the process I was hurting the 
					person that loved me most. It was wrong for me to be hostile 
					towards you for so long. I was wrong all along. I realize it 
					now and I know it is too late too.&nbsp;And here I am today 
					facing my worst fear because of me and you are not a part of 
					my life.”</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears will keep rolling down his cheeks and his eyes 
					will be red. He will sniff from time to time to trying to 
					control his outburst. His face will be expressionless 
					however, very mundane and intact. I will continue to give 
					him a blank stare in disbelief. Somewhere in my mind I will 
					desire to forgive him and forget the past. I will desire to 
					start over new. But more than half of me will retaliate 
					because then he will have his way, again. He will win me 
					over and get what he wants and most importantly he will only 
					be demonstrating his selfishness and will achieve it. Even 
					if I do forgive him and decide to marry him, he will be my 
					first husband but I will be his second wife. He will have 
					kept his dignity for so long. It will be time for me to keep 
					mine. He will have only made it easier for me to let go of 
					him after the gap he will have created between us. These 
					thoughts will be rumbling in my mind. They will be as 
					vigorous as pebbles when shaken in an earthen pot, the 
					massive amount of noise only in my mind. I will not say a 
					word of this to him. He will be hurt and I will not hurt him 
					anymore. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He 
					will wipe his face, stand up and walk towards me. He will 
					kiss me on my forehead and hug me. He will walk towards the 
					front door and say “I think I should leave now.” He will say 
					this with his back towards me. I will try and gather myself 
					from the shock and say “Where are you going to stay 
					tonight?”&nbsp;<br>
					“New Jersey has plenty of motels.”&nbsp;<br>
					“You shouldn’t be alone, like this.” I paused for a few 
					moments. He will still have his back towards me. “Stay over. 
					I have a guest room with a bathroom and a walk in closet.” 
					(He loves apartments with a bedroom, its bathroom and a walk 
					in closet. Sometimes, I compared myself to his certain 
					choice of apartments, but that’s another story). He will 
					turn around and forcibly smile. I smile in return trying to 
					make him comfortable. His eyes will fill with tears again. I 
					will point out the guest room.</font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
					continental ring tone disturbs my thoughts and brings me 
					back to the present, reality. My phone was vibrating and 
					ringing. The vibration against the wooden table made an 
					absurd noise. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It 
					has been three years since our break up. He has been married 
					since the last two. I haven’t spoken to him since. I didn’t 
					make an effort to investigate where he was or how he was 
					doing. I have unknowingly avoided getting involved with any 
					man romantically or the thought of sharing my life with 
					someone or its importance. I still crave for this man that 
					just left me in the middle of nowhere and took off of my 
					life, our lives. I still crave for his touch, his skin 
					against mine, his lips on mine, his warmth, his arms around 
					me, and his manhood, his everything. Sometimes, I go back to 
					my journals and read the pages I wrote when I was with him. 
					I try to relive some moments just like they were back when 
					we were in love. I try to refresh his memories. I try to 
					remember him. We haven’t spoken since my return from India 
					neither has he made an effort. Instead, he got married and 
					settled with a nice girl. </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
					still wonder at times how my life got so distorted and out 
					of control. What really was the reason for our break up? Was 
					I too harsh on him? I wonder if he ever thinks of me. I 
					wonder if he misses me the way I miss him, I wonder if every 
					little thing reminds him of me, I wonder if he has replaced 
					me with someone else, perhaps he has. Isn’t that how life 
					is? </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
					ringing continued. I dragged myself up from the comfortable 
					position I was in to answer my phone. The caller id showed a 
					number I didn’t recognize. Texas perhaps, I thought. 
					Answering the phone I said “This is Sam.” There was silence 
					on the other end. I spoke again “Hello?” </font></p>
					<p align="justify"><font face="Abadi MT Condensed">A faint 
					voice came through, confused “Sam, it’s me!” </font></div>
