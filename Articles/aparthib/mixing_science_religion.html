  Often there are attempts by some apologists of religion to link science with a 
  religious verse and claim originality of religious verses on the discovery of 
  scientific truths. This is a flawed attempt, as I will argue below, that is 
  often made by apologetics of all religions. If one likes to see science in 
  anything they can see it anywhere. One &quot;Joe Schmoe&quot; may have said &quot;All is 
  relative&quot; before Einstein's theory of relativity was known. By this stretch of 
  imagination that Joe can legitimately claim that he already knew about 
  relativity and claim originality. Any vague phrase, puns, allegories, quote 
  etc by humans, scriptures etc can be customized and made to fit any scientific 
  principle when that scientific principle is phrased in a very general way for 
  popular consumption, hiding the underlying precise sense and formulation of 
  these principles. By claiming these scientific principles were already 
  contained in the revelations one is basically denying the painstaking research 
  has helped unravel the complex workings of the laws of nature and reality.</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Serif,Sans-Serif,Times New Roman"><br>
  None of these scientific discoveries were inspired FROM, dependent ON, or 
  UTILIZED, any of the religious revelations. If religious revelations could not 
  and did not lead to any of the discovery of these scientific truths in a stand 
  alone way then by any criterion and logic they cannot be used to vindicate 
  science. There are many unanswered questions in the basic understanding of the 
  universe. Why can't the verses of scripture throw any light on them? For 
  example we don't at this time know for sure if the universe is closed, open or 
  flat. No body has dared any prediction to that effect based on any revelation. 
  But if the Answer is ever found out by science I am sure someone will dig out 
  some vague words of a verse from some book of some religion and claim to &quot; 
  see&quot; the answer there that science has finally managed to find. Its always 
  AFTER the fact that these semblances are found. It has never been found BEFORE 
  the scientific discovery. Is that a coincidence? I don't think so. Nobel 
  laureate Physicist Dr. Abdus Salam warned against people trying to explain Big 
  Bang using verses from Koran, saying that the current version of Big Bang is 
  the best known scientific explanation for the creation of the universe. What 
  if a better scientific explanation than Big Bang is found tomorrow? Should the 
  verses be changed to accommodate the new scientific view? Obviously not. It 
  shows the inherent contradiction this leads to. Religious revelations can 
  never vindicate or falsify science. The truth or falsity of a scientific 
  principle lies within science itself. Religious scriptures cannot speak of any 
  scientific principle. Religious revelations are absolute directives and 
  narratives for humans to follow as faith unquestioningly. Many revelations 
  clearly contradict many accepted scientific principles. No scientist of any 
  repute have ever tried to substantiate scientific principles by religious 
  beliefs. Most scientists and theologians would rather not mix faith with 
  objective and rational field of science. Koran/Bible/Gita etc are not books of 
  science. Any coincidental vague semblance between a verse and a popular 
  phrasing of a complex scientific principle is solely due to the very general 
  and vague wordings admitting of any interpretation that one chooses to impose 
  on it. All one needs is some vague reverse fitting argument to connect the 
  two. One can find Quantum Mechanics in Tagore' s poems if they really insist, 
  or relativity in the Buddhist Monk Nagarjun's writing. Just seeing what one 
  likes to see because of a preset belief in the revelations of a favoured 
  religion doesn't make it so by any objective criterion. Faith and logic are 
  incompatible. If faith could be validated by logic (correctly applied with 
  incontrovertible evidences) then it would not be labelled faith but a 
  universal natural principle/phenomenon. Faith that religious revelations 
  contain scientific fact can never be justified by facts, evidences or logic. 
  Some superficial similarities using only words cannot qualify for a proof or 
  evidence. One must be reminded that the mark of a genuine proof, evidence and 
  logic is a consensus that crosses all racial, ethnic and religious boundaries. 
  That is not to say that a consensus is the only criterion of validity, but 
  consensus necessarily follows from logic, evidence and facts. A sound logic 
  using facts only can validate any conclusion. A fact by definition is an 
  incontrovertible observation based on sense perceptions. That's why the laws 
  of science are universal. We don't have an Islamic principle of Relativity, or 
  a Hindu Quantum Mechanics or Christian Law of Evolution. All these scientific 
  principles are convincing to scientists of all denominations. The logic and 
  evidences speak for themselves, no belief in any religion is required for the 
  acceptability of scientific principles. A majority of the scientists and 
  theologians agree that science cannot be corroborated by religious revelations 
  or vice versa. Only a handful of scientists (Almost all of them of 
  questionable credentials, some with mediocre credentials) and zealous 
  followers and apologetics of religious seem to be obsessed by the effort to 
  link the two, which of course they are entitled to with full rights as a free 
  human being as are the skeptics and more moderate followers who disagree and 
  point out the flaws in this effort. There is some inherent inconsistency in 
  this approach to validate religion by science. First, we know that in almost 
  all religions this attempt is made. They are all equally convincing (or 
  unconvincing, take your pick). So, there is no rationale to accept the 
  reasoning of one religion over the other, on grounds of pure logic. Since all 
  the religions are based on the assumption that the others are wrong (in the 
  sense that their holy book is the only one containing the word of God) they 
  can not all be right. But since the reasoning used to validate revelations 
  with science are no better in one religion than the other there is no basis of 
  selecting one as right. Follower &quot;A&quot; of religion &quot;X&quot; will of course only 
  accept the reasoning to link religion &quot;X&quot; with science. Follower &quot;B&quot; of 
  religion &quot;Y&quot; will believe in the reasoning of religion &quot;Y&quot; to link their 
  revelation with science and so on. A valid logic and evidence linking any 
  religion with science should be accepted by ALL, i.e by any follower of any 
  religion, or a skeptic/non-believer. But that obviously is not the case. So 
  none of the reasoning in any of the religions are based on sound logic or 
  argument. Now let me raise the issue of the need to assert the &quot;perceived&quot; 
  link between religion and science. First of all faith in a religious 
  revelation is unconditional. One places faith in the revelations due to being 
  born in that religion and due to reinforcements by society, surroundings and 
  culture etc. ( This is a good example of &quot;meme&quot; in action. One can read the 
  idea of memes in Richard Dawkin's &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; or Susan Blackmore's &quot;The 
  Meme Machine&quot;). Some examples and references of various &quot;A&quot;s from various &quot;Y&quot; 
  s trying to find science in their respective revelations will follow later in 
  this post. Once one stakes their faith in their revelations, the next step is 
  to look for confirmations, reinforcements of that belief. It is a self feeding 
  mechanism whereby an apparent similarity between a revelation and science 
  strengthens the faith which in turn motivates one to &quot;search&quot; for more 
  similarities and the reinforcements add up in a runaway fashion. Now the 
  question is even if one chooses to reinforce this faith by &quot; seeing&quot; the 
  similarities, do they need to declare that similarities to anyone? I would 
  argue NO. If the faith is strong in one's mind then announcing the supposed 
  similarities between revelations and science is not needed to strengthen the 
  faith. A strong faith does not and should not require a public affirmation or 
  sanction. Now if these announcements are made to convince others about the 
  validity of the revelations then the obvious conclusion is that it is not 
  succeeding. It is not convincing many of the moderate religious followers, let 
  alone the skeptics. Majority of the scientists are not convinced (even for the 
  religion that they are born in). Some of the few pseudo and mediocre 
  scientists that do try to prove the truth of revelations with science do so 
  out of some vested interests and are actively funded and supported by wealthy 
  religious organizations or individuals. Others quote the similarities in a 
  metaphorical sense to emphasize that science is encouraged by revelations 
  which is noble in intent but flawed by any logical criterion. A motivation to 
  pursue science is better obtained by exposing the young minds to the beauty of 
  nature and universe through popular science books, movies, field trips etc. My 
  purpose is not to disrespect religion or its revelation, but to question the 
  attempt to reconcile the two in an illogical way. They can be irreconcilable 
  and yet can continue and thrive as separate ways as long as one does not get 
  in the way of the pursuit of the other. Below are some examples of attempts to 
  validate (or reconcile) religious revelations with science covering a cross 
  section of religions. I am excluding Islamic attempt since there is no 
  shortage of that here. More than one readers have aggressively tried to sell 
  that. All the following appear quite convincing, but not enough to pass 
  logical scrutiny to validate their respective revelations and make a logical 
  person believe in them. If one has to accept the &quot; reasoning&quot; for the 
  divineness of revelations any specific religion then in good conscience one 
  has to accept the divineness of the others as well, since they are equally 
  valid in their reasoning:<br>
