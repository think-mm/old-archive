	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Once again it is unfortunate that 
	criticism of Tagore is being labelled as Tagore bashing, mud slinging, 
	Tagore hating, bringing Tagore down etc, and also attributing the criticism 
	as reflecting a lack of &quot;understanding&quot; Tagore, &quot;ignorance/stupidity&quot; of the 
	critic etc. We are very familiar with such intolerance by religious zealots 
	against criticism of prophets or religious doctrines, declaring such 
	critiques as &quot;religion bashing&quot;, &quot;hate mongering&quot;. It is certainly alright 
	to disagree with the views of critics and fans. But the disagreement does 
	not have to involve such judgmental remarks about the critics or fans. One 
	can debate on the veracity or mendacity of factual data, but debating which 
	&quot; subjective view&quot; based on such data is right or wrong, when the data 
	itself is not in dispute, is not amenable to a rational debate and is 
	meaningless. Only if, based on the agreed on data, one draws a conclusion 
	which can be right or wrong in an objective way (i.e a logical proposition), 
	then such conclusion is amenable to a rational debate. A trivial example 
	might be helpful in illustrating this. A and B both agree that each of their 
	cup of coffee contains 100 grams of caffeine. But A says that the coffee is 
	too strong , but B disagrees and says its not strong enough. On such 
	disagreement there really cannot be a rational debate on who is right or 
	wrong. But if A says that there is more caffeine in the cup of coffee than 
	in a can of coke, while B disagrees that there is less, there can be valid 
	debate and the debate can be settled objectively, by referring to 
	nutritional charts. Most critics at least so far here does not seem to be 
	disagreeing on any factual data on Tagore. Of course it is possible that the 
	critic may not know some other factual data that a fan might point out and 
	claim that the critic was wrong in his/her view for not knowing/ considering 
	the additional data. Again, if the view of the critic was objective type and 
	needs revision in view of the added data, then the fan is valid in 
	criticizing the critic. There are examples of such cases. But if the view 
	still remains a subjective one even with the new data factored in, there is 
	no logical way to dismiss that view as right or wrong. Critics and fans (Of 
	course many fans can be critics too, I believe all critics here are also 
	Tagore fans) must be careful while engaging in such debate. It does require 
	some mental discipline. I think that the critics in this forum are all 
	appreciative of the genius of Tagore as far as I can see. But critical 
	thinking which Mukto-Mona promotes, also involves a critical look at widely 
	held views and beliefs on personalities and offer contrarian factual data if 
	applicable. This is an integral part of critical thinking, to those who 
	apotheosize such personalities it may seem as nit picking, cynical thing to 
	do. But it really does not have to be. The rationalist Prabir Ghosh has 
	cited many such contrarian facts about Buddha, Vivekananda, Ram Krishna, 
	Ghandi and other famous personalities in his books on the &quot;Aloukik noy 
	Loukik&quot; series. Nothing unreasonably cynical or hateful about it. 
	Demystifying is part and parcel of critical thinking. We also see such 
	critical analyses with contrarian factual data presented quite commonly in 
	scholarly books on Tagore like that of Dutta and Robinson, but no one will 
	probably call them mudslingers, Tagore bashers, hatemonger of Tagore etc 
	etc. But in this forum some members have indeed used the terms mud slinging, 
	Tagore bashing/hating to characterize critics/ criticisms of Tagore. I would 
	be very interested in knowing which exact view/statements/ conclusions 
	qualify as mudslinging/ Tagore bashing. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">There is some parallel between the 
	way many fans make defensive arguments against critics of Tagore and the 
	critics of religious prophets. For example, point was made by one fan that 
	it is unfair to criticize Tagore because he was after all a human and then 
	the same fan immediately went on to glorify Tagore, much of which no critics 
	can differ. This seems to be self- inconsistent and seems to be a tactic to 
	preclude any criticism of Tagore, effectively implying that why criticize 
	Tagore when we already know that he is human. Its like having it both ways, 
	precluding all criticisms by issuing the &quot;He is only a human&quot; disclaimer and 
	then only resorting to glorification only and thus effectively raising him 
	up from human level. We see the same defense by religious apologists to 
	deflect criticisms of their prophets by issuing the same disclaimer and then 
	resort to glorification and elevation to more than human level. Such 
	disclaimers are only aim at delegitimizing any criticism leaving no option 
	but to glorify only. </font></p>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Finally my own clarification on the 
	debate that has sprung from a comment by Bonna and resulting in the 
	following comment by Raman Shah: </font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify"><i><font face="Verdana">My point was that just dont 
		wrongly claim that Rabindranath was a &quot;Debota&quot; or &quot;people&quot; think that he 
		was a &quot;Debota&quot; and then thro' your criticism show that he was not a &quot;Debota&quot; 
		at all. </font></i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">I am not sure if Bonna claimed that 
	Tagore was Debota or that she didn't, its not a verifiable or falsifiable 
	conclusion, if by &quot;claim&quot; Raman is implying what Bonna really meant, not 
	affirming in clear terms. We cannot go into the mind of anyone and know what 
	really one means. Debota itself is a vague term. If we accept it to mean a 
	being that is above all criticism, then obviously Bonna did not claim or 
	imply that. On the other hand it is possible that one can claim that 
	&quot;people&quot; think that Tagore was a Debota and then criticize Tagore. Nothing 
	illogical in that. When A claims that &quot;people think B is such and such&quot;, it 
	does not logically follow that A also thinks that B is such and such. We can 
	give examples of ranking personalities as greatest such and such based on 
	result of popular polls. Example are Michael Hart's ranking of prophet 
	Mohammed as the greatest, Sheikh Mujib as the greatest Bangali etc. These 
	are mere tabular ranking based on statistical data, a computer can do that. 
	The pollster himself/herself does not have to believe that those greatest 
	personalities are beyond criticism or that they are indeed greatest in an 
	absolute sense. So in case Bonna was just stating the fact about the wide 
	popularity and apotheosis of Tagore and his impact on Bengali culture, there 
	would be nothing illogical about criticizing some aspects of Tagore by her 
	nevertheless. </font></p>
