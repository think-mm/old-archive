  India's Most Revered Figures</font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#008000">By Aparthib Zaman</font></b></p>
  <p>An aura of sublime, super-humanlike image has always surrounded most of
  India's revered philosophical and religious figures. It has been almost a
  taboo to question or criticize the great icons of Indian philosophy and
  Hinduism. Prabir Ghosh, the premier rationalist of India and founder of Indian
  Science and Rationalist Association, is one of the few to break the taboo and
  has taken an irreverent but realistic look at these venerable figures,
  exposing their fallibility and limitations, and in the process debunking the
  aura of sublimity that the popular view hold in regard to their mystical
  sayings, reducing them to human level. Through his writings we come to know
  about some surprizing facts about these great icons. Those who have like me,
  read all his works attentively, will agree that Prabir does that with utmost
  integrity, inspired only by a desire to seek the truth using rationalism as
  the sole guiding principle. He doesn't make cavalier observations. He has done
  scholarly research and provides exact references from the authentic works on
  the revered figures. He serves no vested interest, is not motivated by any
  selfish motive or desire to gain in any way by doing this. He does this to
  create a sense of critical and independent thinking in the minds of ordinary
  citizens so they can develop a skeptical mind and not accept in blind faith
  all that are widely believed or propagated. Centuries of uncritical veneration
  of these legendary figures have apotheosized them and elevated them to a high
  pedestal in a way that to subject them to a critical scrutiny is considered a
  sacrilege. Prabir tries to show that there is no reason to apotheosize these
  revered figures, that they were not infallible, that despite their mystical
  and religious charisma they lacked scientific knowledge or insight, there was
  nothing exceptionally profound in their sayings and they were susceptiblle to
  flaws and pitfalls.</p>
  <p>I will try to share with the readers what I have learned from reading his
  Bangla books in the series &quot;Aloukik Noi Loukik&quot; (Natural, not
  Supernatural) in five volumes and the books &quot;Ami Keno Ishwarey Bishwash
  Kori Na&quot; (Why I don't believe in God), &quot;Probad, Shongskar o
  kushongskar&quot; (Idioms, traditions and superstitions), praphrasing in
  English quotes from his books. I will refer to &quot;Aloukik Noi Loukik&quot;
  as ANL, and ANL-1, ANL-2 will refer to volumes 1, 2 etc of &quot;Aloukik Noi
  Loukik&quot;</p>
  <p>In ANL-4, p-19,20 Prabir quotes Swami Vivekananda in &quot;Vivekanando
  Rachana Shamagro, Akhando Bangla Shongskaran (Complete works of Vivekananada,
  Bangla edition in single volume), published by Nabopatro, p-264&quot; as
  saying that &quot; mind and matter are interchangeable, depending on
  frequency. If you add enough energy to a piece of steel, the steel will first
  sound a hum, then glow as more energy is added to it, will eventually
  disappear and become mind&quot; ! Commenting on the above Prabir says(p-19):
  &quot;Only those Vivekanando fanatics who vocally declare him as the mother of
  all scientists in prestigious magazines, and fasionable seminars can try to
  establish this revolutionary &quot;mind without brain and neuron&quot; theory
  of Vivekanando!&quot;</p>
  <p>On p-68 of ANL-4 he quotes &quot;Nijer Katha&quot; by Rishi Aravinda, a
  Bangla translation of &quot;Sri Aurobindo on himself&quot; published by Sri
  Aurobindo Asram, Pondicherry, 1990, pages-37,38 where Aurobindo claims that he
  stopped Hitler and Japan from being victorious during second world war by
  applying the spiritual energy of his &quot;supermind&quot; !</p>
  <p>On p-69, Prabir commenting on the above, wondered, if such a formidable
  army of Germany and Japan could be defeated by his spiritual energy, how come
  he did not or could use the same spiritual energy to defeat the much less
  formidable British to win India's freedom!.</p>
  <p>He also quotes from page 88 of Aurobindo's book as saying: &quot;I don't
  think from my brain or head anymore. My thoughts come from the sublime
  vastness that resides over my head&quot;</p>
  <p>Prabir then goes on to quote an internationally reputed psychologist as
  saying that &quot;If any eductated person made such remark today, any doctor
  would seriously doubt his mental sanity&quot;.</p>
  <p>He mentions on p-126, ANL-4 about Physicist S.N. Bose's belief in
  supernatural and that he was a devotee of many God men!</p>
  <p>On p-162, ANL-4, referring to the veneration and awe shown by people of all
  walks of life towards Ramkrishna, Aurobindo, and Vivekanando, Prabir observes
  that actually these spiritual spokesmen(Addhattik probokta) never developed a
  well-established, well-formulated, distinct school of thought, nor did they
  care to engage in dialectics, proof, explanation etc. Their sole task was to
  repeat, in all its variations, the same platitudinous remarks like &quot;faith
  brings gains&quot; (Bishshashey Milaey Bostu), &quot;All except Brahma is
  illusion&quot;, &quot;Soul(Atma) is truth&quot;, etc all based on the ancient
  religious texts. He also referred to the logical positivists' opining that all
  the philosophical views of early philosophers were nothing but narratives,
  playing with words. Ghosh wondered if these early philosphers are viewed this
  way, where would Aurobindo-Vivekanando-Ramkrishhna stand vis a vis this
  critique?</p>
  <p>On p-67 of &quot;Probad, shongskar o kushongskar&quot;, Prabir points out
  the discrepancy in the thoughts and words of Gandhiji and Vivekananda He
  wonders, while pointing out that Gandhiji wanted a Ram Rule (Ram Rajya) and at
  the same time emancipation of Harijan, how an educated politician like Gandhi
  failed to realize that Harijans cannot be emancipated under Ram rule, rather
  the untouchables would lose honour, life to the upper caste under such a rule.</p>
  <p>Referring to Vivekanando's philosophy Prabir says: &quot;Swami Vivekanando
  spoke on one hand about chandals, sweepers, cobblers and on the other hand has
  eulogized Sanatan(Ancient) Hindu religion and its caste system. Is this self-
  contradiction of Vivekanando a hypocriciy of a politician? Was he a
  politician-saint? Is this why he is the symbol of BJP today?</p>
  <p>Radha Krishnan is revered as the top exponent of Indian philosophy. Here's
  what Prabir has to say on RK. On p-35, ANL-5, he Questions Radha Krishnan's
  claim that Hinduism is fundamentally monotheistic. He thinks that was due to
  inluence of British rule, causing them to believe in the superiority of
  chritian monotheism and thus did not hesitate to distort history. Prabir
  asserts that Vedic literature is polyheistic and places Jajna (ritual worship)
  over any God in achieving one's goals.</p>
  <p>On p-23,26 of &quot;Why I don't believe in God&quot; Prabir, while refering
  to the remark of Gandhiji, the father of the nation, that the loss of lives
  and properties in Bihar earthquake was due to God's wrath provoked by the sin
  and lack of belief in God by the local people, commented that the above remark
  of our father of the nation reflects ignorance in such a big way that does not
  merit any further discussion.</p>
  <p>(My note: Tagore also was critical of Gandhi's remarks on the Bihar quake
  tragedy)</p>
  <p>On p-64-72 of &quot;Why I don't believe in God&quot; he debunks, in the
  light of modern psychology and neurology, the claim that Ramkrishna and other
  religious mystics have &quot;seen&quot; God, explaining such claims as being
  the result of various states of brain, specifically refers to five stages of
  &quot;religious mysticism&quot; as a neurological illusion citing from the
  book &quot;Modern Synopsis of Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatrist&quot; By
  Kaplan and Sadock.</p>
  <p>On p-96 of &quot;Why I don't believe in God&quot; he mentions that
  Vivekananda said yes to the question of whether any religon othetr than
  Hinduism is like a germ that will cause suffering in life after, and that the
  advent of Islam in India is like the attack of a bacteria on human body (Bani
  o Rochona, Swami Vivekananda, vol-5, page-43)</p>
  <p>(My Note: In a striking similarity, Nazis said that Jews are like an
  infectious bacilus that had to be eradicated to control a contagious disease,
  ss quoted on p-154 of the book &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; by MIT psychologist
  Steven Pinker)</p>
  <p>On p-117, ANL-5, Prabir exposes the hypocrisy of Vivekanada:</p>
  <p>He contrasts the saying of Vivekanada: &quot;Those who shows kindness to
  animals, serve God&quot; with his introduction of animal sacrifice in
  Barahnagar Moth(Temple). He also exposes the shrewed calculativeness of
  Vivekananda in serving the poor. In one of his letter to Swami Brahmananda he
  (Vivekananda) instructed &quot;After spending for the Calcutta meeting,
  whatever money is left over spend it to feed the famine victims, or help the
  poor in the lanes of Calcutta, Domrapara, Haripara. Only then they will
  believe in Hindutya, only then they will listen&quot; (Potraboli, letter
  number 363).</p>
  <p>On one hand Vivekananda sang &quot;India, don't forget your sweepers,
  cobblers, Chandals, you are all brothers&quot;, &quot;There can be no relgion
  in empty stomach&quot;, &quot;Let India emerge from the peasant's hut&quot;
  etc and on the other hand he wrote letters to his disciples instructing them
  not to create strife between the rich and the poor, not to criticize the
  rich&quot; etc. (Potraboli, letter number 476)</p>
  <p>On child marriage Vivekananda had contradictory views. He said &quot;I hate
  child marriage very much&quot; (In Bharotio Nari, published by Udbodhon
  Karjyaloy, p-90), while on page-15 he is quoted as saying &quot;Sometimes
  children are married at early age, because that is mandated by the Varna. If
  one has to be married off without their opinion, they better be married in
  childhood before they develop any romantic feelings&quot;</p>
  <p>Quoting Vivenkakanda on the British: &quot;There is none here who loves the
  British more than I do&quot; (quoted from Vivekananda and samakalin
  bharotborsho, vol-4 p-12).</p>
  <p>He quotes Vivenkakanda in his Vani and Rachana, p-253: &quot;Everyone says
  to British, give us more. How much more do they want from the British? They
  have given us rail, telegram, order and discipline in the state, driven away
  the robbers, given science education.. What more can they give? I say, they
  have given you so much, what have you given them?&quot;</p>
  <p>He also mentions Vivekananda's support of widow self- immolation and
  opposition to widow marriage.</p>
  <p>On p-251, ANL-5, he says that to know the self-contradictory nature of
  Vivekananda and Aurovinda it is enough to read their books. But unfortunately
  the educated uppper and middle class buy plenty of their books only to
  decorate their showcase, but don't read them. Truth would have been exposed
  had they read them.</p>
