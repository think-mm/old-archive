  <p align="center"><font color="#000080"><b>By Aparthib</b></font></p>
  <p>This is a general discussion on the roots of religious belief without
  focussing on any specific religion. Let me provide an advanced clarification
  in anticipation of possible angry retorts like &quot;Faith is a personal
  matter, you don't have any right to criticize it&quot; or &quot;You have no
  right to hurt other's religious sentiment by questioning their belief&quot;
  etc. In response to the first anticipated criticism let me state that, YES,
  certainly faith is a personal matter. No one has any right to PREVENT others
  from believing in a faith. But an objective examination of the possible CAUSES
  of faith and pointing out any irrational aspect of faith DOES NOT indicate
  intolerance for the faith itself or prevent anyone from believing in it in the
  same way that we consider a child's belief in fairies irrational but still we
  don' t condemn or criticize them for their belief or prevent them either. The
  second criticism requires a careful response. We can summarize the situation
  as (A is a believer in a faith &quot;X&quot; and B is a skeptic, but not
  intolerant of &quot;X&quot;.)</p>
  <p>A: I believe in &quot;X&quot;. .</p>
  <p>B: Belief in &quot;X&quot; is irrational because [...], and hence I don't
  believe<br>
  in &quot;X&quot;.</p>
  <p>A: Any criticism of my belief amounts to hurting my sentiment. Besides<br>
  your not believing in &quot;X&quot; is as much a belief as my believing in
  &quot;X&quot;.</p>
  <p>B: If you call my &quot;not believing in X&quot; a faith ( lets call it
  faith &quot;Y&quot;)<br>
  , then by the same logic your &quot;belief in X&quot; amounts to not believing
  in<br>
  &quot;Y&quot; and automatically implies irrationality of &quot;Y&quot; and
  hence is no<br>
  different from my not believing in &quot;X&quot; and hence I have equal rights
  to<br>
  be insulted for your implication of the irrationality of my faith
  &quot;Y&quot;,<br>
  although I will not exercise my rights.</p>
  <p>The above hypothetical dialog illustrates the spirit of my discussion. I
  have no intention of hurting or there can be no logical way for me to hurt
  anyone by my contrary opinions, views or reasoning. Besides what is meant by a
  belief being hurt anyway?. Let us dissect this frequent expression of angry
  response. Does faith being hurt mean the faith is weakened? If so then its a
  reflection of the weakness of the person placing the faith and if the
  criticism weakens his/her faith then it is an indirect vindication of the
  validity of the criticism. If faith is not weakened by criticism then the
  meaning of &quot;faith being hurt&quot; must be that the believer is mentally
  distressed that someone is not agreeing with his/her belief. In that case it
  indicates an intolerance of any dissenting views and a frustrated ego to know
  that others are not sharing in their favored belief. There can be no other
  meaning of &quot; being hurt&quot; in this context. Faith is internal in one's
  heart, no words or actions can affect or change it and as long as one is not
  persecuted for their faith, any critical discussion of a faith should be a non
  issue for a believer, instead it should provide the believer with an
  opportunity to test his/her strength in their belief in the face of a critical
  study of their faith by skeptics. Having established the preamble let me go on
  to my main discussion.</p>
  <p>Often people who have absolute faith in a given religion justify their
  believing in that particular religion by saying that the world around us is so
  orderly and that the mystery of life and death, the amazing complexity of
  human body, mind etc are impossible for human to create/ understand, so there
  must be a grand designer, i.e GOD. They are confusing belief in religion with
  belief in GOD (the &quot;creator&quot; of this universe). Belief in a religion
  is much more than believing in GOD, it requires believing blindly in all that
  is preached in that religion, for example that the holy book of their religion
  is literally the word of GOD, that all the miraculous events mentioned in
  their holy books are true and that all that are instructed/taught in their
  holy books are absolute and should be followed and all the divine revelations
  of that religion be believed without question. All these require blind faith
  since these cannot be verified/justified by logic or rational thinking or
  objective evidence. The sense of awe and mystery that led them to postulate a
  grand designer, is erroneously extended into justifying a belief in these
  additional human constructs besides the universal human instincts of the
  perception of a grand designer. One important point (which is self-evident but
  seems hard to come to grip with) is that although an instinct of God and Life
  after death is a universal one and is not necessarily a result of
  indoctrination or belief in other humans, any belief in the revelations of a
  particular religion on the other hand really stems ultimately from a belief in
  other humans and indoctrination. Since few have direct oracular experience
  regarding divine revelations, most of those who have firm belief in them have
  placed a firm belief in what they have been told through preaching by fellow
  humans, reading books (Printed by humans) etc. If someone believes in the
  revelations due to a direct divine experience (Which no other person can
  verify) totally on their own and not having been told about them, then that
  would indeed be a sound basis for a firm belief. But even in that case if that
  person told others about his/her experience ( and it would be a truthful
  account, excluding of course hallucinatory experiences/ illusions etc) and
  others believed in him/her, then the belief of others will be a result of
  belief in a human, unlike the person who experienced the divine revelations
  directly. So from this it is quite clear that all the major religions are
  based ultimately on belief in humans (This chain of belief in humans ending
  ultimately in the prophets, also humans). This chain can be symbolized in the
  form below:</p>
  <p>&quot;A believes in B who says that he believes in C who says that he<br>
  believes in D who says that....... who SAID that he believed in Z who<br>
  said that God said that....(revelations)&quot;</p>
  <p>(For this instance imagine there are billions of people between A and Z and
  1400/2000 years have passed between Z and A. ). The entire edifice of revealed
  religion and divinity is based on this chain of belief in humans.</p>
  <p>Another important point to remember is that one can be led to believe in
  the existence of some Supreme Entity because of the very reason mentioned in
  the beginning i.e, the sense of awe and wonder at the beauty/complexity of the
  Universe and the consequent hypothesis that there must be some super being
  that is behind all this, but the same reason may not motivate one to believe
  in any one of the existing religion. Often those who don't believe in any
  existing religion are labeled as atheist/Godless whereas in reality they may
  be equally or more awed by the mystery of the universe and have their own
  concept of a Super Entity (Not necessarily an entity with the attributes
  defined by those religions). As mentioned before belief in a given religion is
  a result of blind faith. This blind faith is caused by being born in a
  particular religion where one is indoctrinated from birth about the
  authenticity of their religion and the rigid religious surrounding where one
  grows up and witnesses everyone around him/her following/ believing in the
  same religion and preaching other religions to be inferior/wrong, which
  instills a blind and biased faith which is ingrained in their mind firmly and
  becomes an absolute truth to them, losing not only any ability to critically
  examine its rational basis, but shuddering at the very thought of such a
  critical assessment as being taboo and a mortal sin. It illustrates the idea
  of memes, which are equivalent to viruses of beliefs and ideas that spread
  from one individual/group to another. If someone born in a certain religion is
  brought up in a totally neutral environment (As far as religion is concerned)
  but otherwise same way as others and is introduced to ALL religions when they
  are adult the odds are that he/she may choose ANY one of those religions (NOT
  necessarily the one he/she was born. Assuming also that this info of which
  religion he/she was born into is also kept unknown to him/her) or may not even
  choose any at all. So there is no absolute reason for believing in any given
  religion. Regarding the incidence of spontaneous conversion from one religion
  into other, that happens between all religions so there is nothing
  preferentially absolute about any given religion either. Individual incidences
  of conversion from Religion-X to Religion-Y or from no- religion to Religion-Z
  does not exclusively establish the rationality of any religion, because cross
  conversions occur between all religions in differing degrees..</p>
  <p>There is a flaw in the way one arrives at the notion of divine creation by
  a conscious being in the image of a human albeit with superhuman attributes (i.e
  God) just out of a sense of awe at the level of complexity of life (Human in
  particular). We are seeing an end product of an evolution that went on for
  over 4 billion years before arriving at the form what we see today. If a human
  being sprang up from scratch to its advanced form in one swoop, it would
  indeed be a miracle. But starting from a single celled organism 4 billion
  years ago and progressively becoming more and more complex/organized,
  incrementally adding more and more features through the process of natural
  selection and mutation(A trial error so to speak), taken over an incredible
  length of time of 4 billion years, if one pause to think of this process, it
  may not seem that incredible or miraculous after all. It is true that how from
  a complex organic molecule, the first cell with a complete characteristics of
  reproduction, protein synthesis and genetic transmission developed is still, a
  mystery. But a mystery is not a miracle. One may have noticed that when one
  watches a baby grow up day by day the transformation from a baby to grown up
  doesn't strike him/ her at all and happens in a natural way vs one who saw the
  baby once and then came back after a long gap to see the baby grow up to an
  adult is struck by the transformation. If one had the longevity of a billion
  years and watched the simple primitive organic molecule evolve bit by bit to
  complex molecules, then to cells to complex cells, then to primitive life
  forms and eventually to human and other species over this length of time this
  would also appear quite natural. One simply has to appreciate the power of
  evolution in the process of self organization and complexity over an extended
  period of time. We are all familiar with this self organization process in
  daily life on a much compressed scale when we see the finished product which
  amaze our eyes to see it being made from raw ingredients barely resembling it
  in beauty and symmetry. It can be an artificial product like a jewelry, or a
  natural one like the ice crystals formed out of raindrops etc showing amazing
  symmetry and beauty. It is the Law of Physics that is the grand designer of
  everything including Life. It is the Laws of Physics that manifests itself in
  biogenesis and evolution at the cell level. We don't know how or where did The
  Laws of Physics itself come from. Postulating an uncreated and ever-existing
  GOD who created the Laws of Physics is not any more profound than the simpler
  and more likely postulate of an uncreated and ever- existing Laws of Physics
  that gave rise to the entire universe with life through the materialization of
  the laws.</p>
  <p>Let us now list and examine some other possible root causes for belief<br>
  in religion and God by most people (Common to all religions):</p>
  <p>A. Reasons rooted in wishful thinking and personal needs</p>
  <p>B. Reasons rooted in illogical conclusions drawn from events in life</p>
  <p>C. Reasons rooted in Social Needs</p>
  <p>D. Reasons rooted in the evolutionary history and neurophysiology of
  Humans.</p>
  <p>Although D is the most fundamental level of explanation of the origin of
  religious belief, it is instructive to also view it in the higher levels as in
  A-C, which themselves are rooted in D. Let me expand on each cases above.</p>
  <p>A. Reasons rooted in wishful thinking and personal needs:</p>
  <p>1) Fear of death and loss of loved ones. The wish for a life after death.
  Humans find it extremely hard to accept that death means a permanent
  destruction of their body and mind and loss of their loved ones. There is a
  yearning innate to humans as an instinct for a permanent life and/or to join
  their deceased loved ones. This yearning to live for ever beyond this world
  reflects a deep rooted love for one' s self, in other words a kind of
  narcissism. The fact is that it is the collective survival of the human race
  that is meaningful. Each individual is just a link in the infinite chain of
  the continuity of human species. Each death of an individual is replaced by
  the birth of another life. One should look at their individual life as playing
  a meaningful role in maintaining this continuity. Each generation inherits the
  fruits of the advances and knowledge of its predecessor and passes it on in a
  value added way to its successor and human race as a whole is forever
  progressing further and further, and eventually may spread beyond the planet
  earth to the outer reaches of the universe. As scientist Daniel Hillis says
  &quot;Its haughty of us to think we're the end product of evolution. All of us
  are part of producing whatever is coming next&quot;. (&quot; Third culture -
  Brockman&quot;, page-385). Here's another moving quote by the famous Carl
  Sagan in his death bed: (As appeared in the March 1997 issue of Parade
  magazine): &quot;I would love to believe that when I die I will live again,
  that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But much as
  I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural
  traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is
  more than wishful thinking.</p>
  <p><br>
  The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no
  reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good
  evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in
  the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity
  that life provides.&quot;</p>
  <p>2) Problems/Crisis in life and a sense of helplessness when no solution is
  found, or a sense of frustration/outrage at the injustice and unfairness that
  exists. A belief in God who will take care of all the problems and will mete
  out justice in due time provides a sense of hope and comfort and a driving
  force to continue on with life amidst this helplessness/frustration. Also the
  hope that all unfulfilled dreams and material aspirations that were not met in
  this world may be fulfilled in the life hereafter in heaven. After all, heaven
  is described as the place where all one's desires and lusts (virgins,
  ambrosia, jewelry, delicious foods etc) will be met and provided.</p>
  <p>3) The need to fill the inner spiritual vacuum and an inherent spiritual
  need of human to understand the meaning of this world and life. This is behind
  a Hindu meditating, doing yoga, a Muslim offering prayer or a Christian
  reciting a hymn etc. This inner spiritual vacuum arises out of a sense of
  helplessness and being overwhelmed by the vicissitude of life where it seems
  like one has no ultimate control of anything about their own life, nothing
  happens as one wishes and one goes through ups and downs that seem to be hard
  to explain and thus one develops a sense that there exists a force that acts
  mysteriously and their lives are guided/ controlled by this mysterious force
  and then they resort to some form of worship, meditation as a symbolic means
  of uniting with that force or gaining enlightenment about it. But the point
  here is that belief in religion /God and ritual worshipping is not the ONLY or
  the BEST way of filling this inner spiritual vacuum. A very appropriate way of
  filling this is through the pursuit of and eventual acquisition of knowledge
  and truth about nature. Carl Sagan couldn't have said it better. KNOWING that
  there exist billions of galaxies, each galaxies containing billions of stars,
  and billions of stars containing planets and sun and earth being only one out
  of those billions star-planet duo is in itself a spiritually fulfilling
  experience. (In his ABC Nightline interview few months before his death) .
  Knowing how species evolve from one another and how life develops from a
  minute sperm to a full grown life form, how the complex molecules self
  organize into a living DNA structure, all these knowledge gets one closer to
  an understanding of the deep mysteries of nature. After all, these
  meditations/prayer of a ritually religious persons are intended to attain
  enlightenment, isn't it? If nature is the creation of some supreme deity then
  the mystery of nature (Reading the &quot;mind&quot; of God as Stephen Hawking
  puts it) by harnessing the full power of the wonderful gift of nature that
  human possesses: Intellect. Since in ancient days human didn't develop the
  mental faculty of pursuing knowledge and truth through reasoning/
  observation/scientific methodology, meditation/ prayer was the only means of
  resorting to this urge to experience and be close to nature, and this has
  continued in a vestigial way up to this day specially by those who don't have
  the perseverance and are not intellectually prepared to pursue the route of
  seeking knowledge through scientific study or have a total blind faith in a
  given religion.</p>
  <p>B. Reasons rooted in illogical conclusions drawn from events in Life:</p>
  <p>4). Recovering from a serious illness or problem. Seems to be too unlikely
  without a divine intervention. Human instinct is not to accept randomness and
  chance factor in nature, but instead to find meaning in everything, a meaning
  that helps to give one an illusion that he/she is not just any product of
  nature, but something special that is being watched over. And hence the need
  to invent a personal God.</p>
  <p>5). Sudden acquisition of wealth and happiness when subconsciously
  realizing that he/ she didn't really deserve it. Rather than treat it as a
  pure chance/luck there is an inherent desire to thank Someone/ Something for
  this fortune for being &quot;Chosen&quot; by that Someone/Something for such
  special favour and hoping that by expressing gratitude to that
  Someone/Something, He/It will protect him/her from losing this sudden
  unexpectedly gotten material happiness. It is an interesting irony that one
  person's good fortune convinces him/ her about the existence of God whereas
  millions of humans routinely face misfortunes which should have provided more
  forceful reasons to the contrary. After all, the existence of God cannot be
  justified by one person's fortune.</p>
  <p>C. Reasons rooted in Social Needs:</p>
  <p>6). A desire to have a sense of belonging. It is a human instinct to be
  part of a bigger whole out of a sense of insecurity and a need of a social
  safety net This is also rooted in our animal ancestry where packing instinct
  is observed. Religion offers that sense of belonging and community feeling
  through church/mosque/temple etc where people congregate and share fellow
  feeling and through religious based social/ cultural festivals/activities.
  This reason explains adherence to religion as a custom, not God as a belief.</p>
  <p>All of the above really point to a belief caused by a &quot;need&quot; ,
  not a belief that results from a genuine and dispassionate endeavor for
  seeking the truth. Also there is a myth about &quot;explaining&quot; all the
  inconsistencies/contradictions that exist in a religion (in its
  scripture,revelations,tenets) when it is pointed out by critical thinkers to a
  blind believer of a religion. One who has formed a belief blindly, can in no
  way objectively and critically form an &quot;explanation&quot;. Their
  explanation will necessarily be an effort to justify and explain ( to their
  convenience) what they already have placed blind faith in unconditionally. Any
  explanation, which is only for consumption by the members of that same faith
  and does not convince any one else hardly qualifies as a rational explanation
  but merely serves as a placebo to the members to assuage their doubts and as a
  form of artificial affirmation. Even those believers who are often bothered at
  first by some inconsistencies surrender to some perceived &quot;scholars&quot;
  in religion to do the explaining for them so they can rest assured with no
  doubts in mind. They will not try to critically examine the merit of those
  explanations as they are merely seeking a POST HOC affirmation of their a
  priori absolute faith and are just content with the fact that someone with a
  much higher &quot;scholastic&quot; mind (scholasticism limited to divinity
  that is) is doing the explanation which they are desperately in need of for
  the affirmation of something they have staked their belief in, and would
  rather not face upto any serious inconsistencies of their faith and retract
  from it as the resulting disenchantment would be devastating to their
  emotional psyche . Oftentimes believers in blind faith respond to critics of
  their blind belief (atheists/agnostics/ freethinkers) saying their critics are
  biased themselves and their disbelief in the blind faith is itself due to
  their bias against the believers. One has to be very careful here. Atheists/
  skeptics/agnostics exist BECAUSE OF blind believers and NOT the other way
  around. It is the constant claims and persuasive attempt to force the belief
  on others that created the skeptics/atheists etc as a counter reaction.
  Believers of blind faith do so out of a need and has great stake in the
  preservation and propagation of the perceived truth of his/her belief and
  hence would defend any criticism of it without caring to judge the merit of
  the criticism. On the other hand a disbeliever of a blind faith has nothing to
  gain just by not believing and criticizing any claims of truth of the blind
  faith holders. His/her non-belief is a result of the analytical thinking
  preventing him/her from accepting a belief irrationally just because they are
  being told so. Far from gaining anything from the non-belief they rather take
  on potential risk of back lash by the blind believers as well as depriving
  themselves from the pleasant feelings generated by the blind belief. Anything
  that has a rational basis will never be rejected/criticized by a rational
  person. On the other hand a rational person can sometimes have a blind faith
  (until conclusively proven wrong by evidence and logic) and will honestly
  admit that the blind belief is due to a wishful desire and since it has not
  been proven wrong by evidence or logic might as well believe in it (But not
  trying to propagate it through imposition on others). So the bottom line is
  that a rational person who decides not to believe in a blind faith can never
  do so out of any bias. Check the link at htp://www.skeptic.com/990126.html for

  <p>D. Last but not the least, Reasons rooted in the evolutionary history and<br>
  neurophysiology of Human:<br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  This is the view of the origin of religious belief at the most fundamental
  level. A revolutionary understanding of cognitive science pioneered by Noam
  Chomsky and other linguists and cognitive scientists was that the instinct of
  language is ingrained universally in human brain that enables a child to learn
  a language instinctively without being taught. The fact that religious (or
  more appropriately mystical) feelings are also quite universal and appears
  independently in different cultures and is a universal phenomena. That points
  to a possible similar neurophysiological root of religious belief. There seems
  to be an inbuilt mechanism in nature to evolve a defensive system in the face
  of new challenges for survival and propagation. It is plausible that belief in
  religion came about due to an evolutionary process necessitated by the
  appearance of consciousness in human species. Due to this consciousness human
  were able/forced to wonder if there is life after death, developed the
  yearning for not to die and the yearning to not let their dear ones die. These
  desires and yearnings are not the usual necessary ingredients of the two key
  elements of evolution, viz, random mutation and natural selection for
  survival, but are an unexpected feature of human species. Due to this new
  element of consciousness human species needed a new factor in the survival of
  the species process besides mutation and natural selection. Belief in religion
  and faith is this new element. Without a belief in life after death, or in
  GOD's existence suddenly the driving force of life for humans with limited
  intellect would seem to disappear and there would be total chaos and anarchy
  and eventual destruction of human species. Since lower animals don't have the
  consciousness to even worry about death or life after death they go about
  leading their normal life cycle (eating, living, propagating etc) whereas for
  human this awareness creates a need for a driving force (meaning of life) to
  continue the normal life cycle without major disruptions. So the belief in
  religion was an inevitable outcome of the emergence of consciousness in full
  form ( intelligence) in the human species. It is also the speculation of
  sociobiologists that faith/religion provide a valuable tool of survival in the
  cultural evolution. It creates a strong cohesive force among the members of a
  given faith and increase their collective odds of achieving longevity as a
  group. There is also another survival aspect of religious belief, which is:
  The most successful religion (measured by number and/or growth rate) is not
  necessarily the one which is true or best in an objective sense but which is
  the most successful in maintaining cohesion among its followers and gives them
  advantage over the other religions. It is possible that this successful
  religion may commit wrongful acts on the other less successful religion/
  faith. My above views would find support in the writings of early philosophers
  as well as recent anthropolgists/biologists. John Fiske, the American
  philosopher said in his 1899 book &quot;Through nature to GOD&quot; : Would it
  not be strange if suddenly, after humans crossed the magic threshold to speech
  and self- awareness, the appearance of religion in all primitive cultures
  would have had no survival value? (From p-381, The Whys of a Philosophical
  scrivener - Martin Gardner). Anthropologist Lionel Tiger says &quot;Religion
  probably has a genetic basis. To guard against the paralysis of deep
  depression. When facing the inevitability of death, natural selection
  responded to this problem by wiring into our brain a moderate propensity to
  embrace sunny scenarios even when they are not supported by the facts&quot;
  (p-381, Gardner). Another anthropologist Pascal Boyer makes a similar point in
  his book: &quot;The Naturalness of Religious Ideas. For an excellent on line
  article on the Biological roots of religious belief check the site http://www.SecularHumanism.org/library/fi/hunt_19_3.html
  In the recent book: &quot;The God Part of the Brain&quot;, Philosopher of
  Science Matthew Alper proposes that beliefs in God, the afterlife, mind-over-
  matter and superstitions have a physiological origin and may be encoded into
  human DNA, evolved as a defense mechanism to help people cope with the anxiety
  that comes from being aware of our own mortality. This explanation of
  religious faith is not new. The new thing is that Alper has made the most
  convincing and irrefutable case so far of this view which is based on the
  results of the latest research on neurology and sociobiology coupled with
  Darwinian metaphysics. It has got rave reviews from sociobiologists and
  philosophers. Readers are finding it hard to refute it. One reader got too
  carried away in his review (under Barnes and Nobles website) and wrote :
  &quot;The Birth of a New Science: Neuroreligion. All 6 billion plus
  inhabitants of Earth should be in possession of this book. Matthew Alper's
  tome should be placed next to the sacred writings section in the libraries,
  bookstores and dwellings throughout the world. Matthew Alper is the new
  Galileo. (Watch your back Matthew!)..&quot; For an online glimpse of the
  premise of Alper's work see http://www.godpart.com/premise.html Modern
  neurological research also points to a purely neurophysiological cause of all
  religious mystical experiences. Here's an article <a href="http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/3/498">http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/9/3/498</a>&nbsp;
  that typifies the modern view from neurological research. For an insightful
  tour of human mind and the biology of religion refer to the book &quot;
  Mystical Mind: Probing the Biology of Religious Experience&quot; by
  Neurophysiologist and psychiatrist Eugene D' Aquilli , and last but not the
  least the monumental tome with 844 pages: &quot;Zen and the Brain&quot;
  written by Dr. James Austen, a Neurophysiologits from the Academia who has
  also practiced Zen meditation himself. All point to a neurophysiological basis
  of all mystical and religious experiences. Finally, there is also an inner
  instinct to have a father figure in life providing an imagined guidance and
  inspiration and a sense of need to be subordinate to such an entity and be
  protected by and accountable to (As symbolically expressed in genuflection
  during prayer, prostration etc). In real life this manifests itself in the
  need to have big brother, a father or a leader. This part of human instinct is
  also derived from our animal ancestors. Even animals display this submissive
  posture to the superiors (Dogs to humans, subordinate animals to the leader of
  their pack etc). The primitive human worshipped imaginary powerful beings
  identified with thunder, fire, mountain etc (Anything that projects power
  higher than human). with increased understanding about nature and more control
  over it human needed some other powerful entities to replace those. Since
  nothing on earth seems to be too powerful and beyond human control so human
  had to invent some imaginary super being to be subordinate and accountable to
  and protected by.</p>
  <p>Let me end with a relevant quote from Einstein: &quot;I cannot imagine a
  God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are
  modeled after our own-a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human
  frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his
  own body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or
  ridiculous egotism.&quot; (Made in 1932, appeared in the book, The Quotable
  Einstein, page-150)
